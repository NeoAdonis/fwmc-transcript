00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.349
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:20.210
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.650
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.011
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:29.592
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:32.432
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:35.333
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.393 --> 00:05:37.113
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:41.434
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.654
Yeah, just today.

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:45.724
Today!

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:46.145
Huh?

00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:50.011
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:50.853 --> 00:05:55.541
Thank you for joining us for our 67th episode today!

00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:56.342
BAU BAU!

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:02.967
Today, today, today, today is FUWAMOCO Morning 67.

00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:04.467
Another day.

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:05.987
Another day.

00:06:06.247 --> 00:06:09.548
Another FUWAMOCO Morning all together!

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:13.989
Maybe this is your first time joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:24.210
And for your information, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday today, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.311
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.831
And it's hosted by us,

00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:29.952
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.134 --> 00:06:32.975
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.576
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:34.596 --> 00:06:42.562
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:48.046
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:48.186 --> 00:06:52.289
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.771
BAU BAU!

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.011
Ruffians, did you BAU BAU there?

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.272
I only saw a few BAU BAUs.

00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:08.217
BAU BAU.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:16.822
Unfortunately, there's been another panel sighting.

00:07:20.224 --> 00:07:22.145
He keeps on showing up everywhere, huh?

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:24.107
I'm sorry, Ruffians.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.862
Where is it this time, Pero?

00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:27.222
Hi.

00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:28.703
De-den.

00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:40.513
At first, you know, I thought it was maybe just, you know, a lovely blue sky, but... Clouds.

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:40.613
Yeah.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:42.275
There's Pero.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:44.450
Yeah, he's not a cloud.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.371
I guess he's just going on his way from place to place, huh?

00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:54.953
You know sometimes working on a construction site, sometimes becoming a Perroccino.

00:07:55.334 --> 00:07:59.075
Right, yeah, but, uh, I don't know.

00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:06.878
Taking a good look at it, he actually looks kind of nice up in the beautiful sky like that.

00:08:08.542 --> 00:08:10.544
Kinda cute, I think.

00:08:11.044 --> 00:08:12.746
I don't know, maybe it's the clouds.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:15.888
I mean, it does make him look kind of pleasant.

00:08:16.408 --> 00:08:17.910
No, it's super nasty!

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.190
Why?

00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:20.212
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:23.554
He's living the life!

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:25.136
I don't know about that.

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:26.136
Like a cloud.

00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:28.598
Still nasty!

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:29.639
His wings work.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:30.500
They work.

00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:31.841
Yeah.

00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:34.003
Very muscular cloud.

00:08:34.163 --> 00:08:35.784
Is Pero a relative Totoro?

00:08:35.844 --> 00:08:36.024
No.

00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:37.165
No.

00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:37.566
No.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.631
No, unfortunately no.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.351
That would have been nice, but no.

00:08:43.432 --> 00:08:44.333
Still nasty?

00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:45.993
The verdict is in.

00:08:46.554 --> 00:08:48.074
Still nasty.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:50.315
Ruffians, you know it.

00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:53.217
Just for your sake.

00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:58.559
It's probably best not to make eye contact with him if you see him around, okay?

00:08:59.359 --> 00:08:59.960
Turn around.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.341
Like you saw an anomaly, okay?

00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:03.701
Turn around, go the other way.

00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:06.483
You never know what could happen.

00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:07.183
Okay?

00:09:08.863 --> 00:09:10.785
BAU BAU!

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:12.526
BAU BAU!

00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.012
Yesterday was a very busy day for FUWAMOCO.

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:36.173
And maybe Ruffians, it was a busy day for you too.

00:09:36.633 --> 00:09:41.634
So, we thought we'd give you an update!

00:09:41.974 --> 00:09:42.795
Nerissa!

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:43.915
Advent.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.505
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:02.733
Ruffians, are you familiar with the song?

00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:03.934
Yeah.

00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:07.617
You know, it's a really famous winter song in Japan, you know?

00:10:08.098 --> 00:10:09.299
It's very emotional.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.162
It's one of the famous classic winter love songs.

00:10:13.182 --> 00:10:14.043
You've heard it before!

00:10:14.123 --> 00:10:15.224
It's sort of like white love!

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:16.185
Yeah.

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:18.267
But Nerissa, she sang...

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:24.577
A really beautiful rendition of this song, so definitely have to make sure you check it out, okay?

00:10:24.637 --> 00:10:25.378
Ruffians!

00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:28.402
And also take a weight off if you haven't yet either, okay?

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:31.726
Also a very famous winter song.

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:33.388
This is little time for that.

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:34.009
Why not?

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.110
It's our show.

00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.944
Thank you for the beautiful music Nerissa!

00:10:43.964 --> 00:10:45.665
That's what you wanted to say, huh?

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:47.946
That's what I wanted to say!

00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:48.266
BAU BAU!

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:04.075
Something went very wrong there, huh?

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:07.380
Mococo.exe is still loading okay.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.241
BAU BAU!

00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:24.384
Well, Ruffians, today is Friday, the 67th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning, but more importantly, today is Pekora-senpai's birthday!

00:11:24.464 --> 00:11:26.866
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:31.009
Happy birthday, Pekora-senpai!

00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:39.156
Well, it's Pekora-senpai's birthday, so we phoned into her birthday stream earlier today, and somehow, there,

00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:44.999
It was determined that we are now three sisters.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.840
A trio of three sisters!

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:48.621
FUWAMOCO Pickle!

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:49.342
Yeah.

00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:50.502
Got that, Ruffians.

00:11:50.582 --> 00:11:51.823
FUWAMOCO Pickle!

00:11:52.423 --> 00:11:52.643
Yeah.

00:11:52.663 --> 00:11:53.283
Even tail.

00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:54.604
Check.

00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:55.044
Check.

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:56.125
Silly.

00:11:56.845 --> 00:11:57.105
Check.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:57.926
Check!

00:11:59.146 --> 00:11:59.547
Dog.

00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:02.068
Meow.

00:12:03.171 --> 00:12:03.791
Yeah!

00:12:04.032 --> 00:12:08.995
You know, I don't know if this makes us triplets, like Pekora-senpai was saying earlier.

00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:11.997
Especially since you know her birthday is today.

00:12:12.217 --> 00:12:14.378
But... That's okay!

00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:18.241
I know she was also saying we'd be like, soberish.

00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.322
But... What about Pero?

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:26.126
Is he being replaced by... Peko?

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.336
I saw a Ruffian asking what happened to Poruru-oneechan.

00:12:32.356 --> 00:12:33.637
Oh, nothing.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.641
Nothing.

00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:40.025
We can have multiple sisters, right?

00:12:40.445 --> 00:12:41.427
I mean, you're here too.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:44.510
You're not gonna forget about me, Moco-chan.

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:48.748
Not like you did with Poruru-oneechan.

00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:50.689
I did!

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.451
Wow!

00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:52.951
Okay.

00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:58.054
Moco-chan also drew a special picture for Pororo-san.

00:12:58.094 --> 00:12:58.294
Yeah!

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.856
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:05.499
Do you like it?

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:07.641
Kusa.

00:13:09.962 --> 00:13:10.743
I do it, you know.

00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:12.918
I drew it, you know.

00:13:12.938 --> 00:13:14.439
It's cute, it's very cute!

00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:17.241
Do you like Pegura-senpai's teeth?

00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:19.002
I made it accurate.

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:38.705
Yeah, well, Pekora-senpai, she liked it so much that she actually covered up Hakurei-senpai's picture with it.

00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:41.307
Sorry Hakurei-senpai!

00:13:42.107 --> 00:13:47.091
But you know, even if the Ruffians think kusai, at least Pekora-senpai liked it.

00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:51.515
That's what matters because it's for Pekora-senpai, not the Ruffians!

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:52.816
BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:04.922 --> 00:14:07.122
Well, Ruffians.

00:14:08.483 --> 00:14:15.766
Actually, recently, some things kind of come to our attention.

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:20.647
I kind of feel that Ruffians, you might have noticed it too.

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:21.088
Maybe.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:34.543
Wow, it seems like Icomochi-mama has come down with a very severe case of BAU BAU BYOU.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:36.185
Did you notice it too?

00:14:37.427 --> 00:14:38.188
Busted!

00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:38.868
Yeah!

00:14:40.678 --> 00:14:49.585
Yeah, well, recently Icomochi-mama has been extra sweet, and silly, and tweeting a bunch, and watching us tweet!

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:53.909
It makes us super duper happy!

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:59.173
We can't help it, you know, when we have such a wonderful, loving, and involved mama!

00:14:59.193 --> 00:15:01.134
It makes us really happy!

00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:05.217
You know, a mama that loves us and really wants to get to know us too!

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:09.977
Like Fuwawa said, very, very happy.

00:15:10.017 --> 00:15:18.403
But, well, you know, BAU BAU will be... There's not too much known about it still.

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:24.667
So, we hope that Icomochi-mama's BAU BAU doesn't get too bad.

00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:30.652
But recently, Icomochi-mama has also been tweeting lots on her sub account.

00:15:30.752 --> 00:15:31.673
Sub account.

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:37.418
More than a mama!

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:44.565
Somehow Icomochi-mama started to feel like she's a grandpa watching over grandkids.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.996
Makes you a Ruffian, makes you watch over Icomochi-mama so her BAU BAU doesn't get

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.050
Okay, no progressing.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:06.477
You know, we would definitely, definitely, definitely never, ever, ever want that, you know?

00:16:07.177 --> 00:16:09.219
No progressing on the BAU BAU of you and me.

00:16:09.459 --> 00:16:09.659
No.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:13.041
Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely not.

00:16:13.262 --> 00:16:16.104
Love you Icomochi-mama!

00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:16.684
Love you!

00:16:16.704 --> 00:16:20.067
See you very soon.

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:23.689
Bye-bye!

00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:24.150
Bye-bye!

00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:27.948
That wouldn't be you!

00:16:28.328 --> 00:16:32.569
But you are mama.

00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:34.790
I don't think you're Icomochi-mama, no!

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.451
I'm not really sort of happy.

00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:40.252
Sort of happy.

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.932
Something else.

00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:44.653
Well, Ruffians.

00:16:45.273 --> 00:16:48.074
We know our eyes are strong, right?

00:16:49.655 --> 00:16:50.355
Right?

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:53.616
We know who we are.

00:16:54.568 --> 00:16:57.030
She even has four eyes now, right?

00:16:58.671 --> 00:16:59.171
BAU BAU.

00:17:00.632 --> 00:17:07.536
So then, do you know what I'm about to say, Ruffians?

00:17:09.037 --> 00:17:09.717
You know it?

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.742
You don't know it, do you, huh?

00:17:16.982 --> 00:17:18.643
What's with that tone, Moco-chan?

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.065
I saw it.

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:25.913
On Twitter.

00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:34.740
Why did you think I wouldn't say hi?

00:17:36.482 --> 00:17:37.122
Hi!

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.426
You know, for the good Ruffians who don't know what I'm talking about.

00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:50.853
You know, on Twitter, there was some intense discussion about my fuzziness.

00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:53.175
But,

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:55.808
Rather than discussion, really.

00:17:55.828 --> 00:17:58.550
It was just bullying!

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:00.911
All bullying!

00:18:01.572 --> 00:18:07.175
Saying that I should have been more curvy in some areas because this and that and this and that!

00:18:07.596 --> 00:18:10.678
And everyone was just saying that I was pitiful!

00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.603
Well, you know, there were some things like... Oh no!

00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:21.465
Poor BAU BAU!

00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:21.645
And...

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:31.048
Like, show her this and, uh, are you sure they're twins and, uh, does she lack nutrition?

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.649
Does she make it up for it in personality?

00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.749
Yeah.

00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:41.830
That I'm good despite it anyways.

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:47.011
Have you ever tried saying that to a girl?

00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:49.011
Hi!

00:18:52.992 --> 00:18:53.392
Not well.

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:58.728
You still like her, but despite how she looks, huh?

00:19:00.888 --> 00:19:01.208
Huh?

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.930
What the heck?

00:19:08.771 --> 00:19:15.134
You know what I want to say, you know?

00:19:18.035 --> 00:19:21.577
And, you know, you wonder why I always want to be reassured, huh?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.880
Nevermind them.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.321
I guess.

00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:30.241
Whatever.

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:32.402
Next corner!

00:19:35.983 --> 00:19:38.963
It's okay, it's just a misunderstanding, right Ruffians?

00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:41.264
It's just a misunderstanding, huh?

00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:41.444
Right?

00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:42.544
Right?

00:19:47.571 --> 00:19:50.452
Speaking of misunderstandings, Ruffians!

00:19:50.472 --> 00:20:08.421
This is a little silly, but it seems like ever since it became the new year, there has been a serious, serious... There's been no misunderstanding.

00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:09.541
No.

00:20:10.942 --> 00:20:11.122
Huh?

00:20:12.743 --> 00:20:12.943
Huh?

00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:13.263
It's good.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:15.804
It's good.

00:20:17.298 --> 00:20:17.558
Huh?

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.161
That's great!

00:20:20.723 --> 00:20:31.719
For all the Ruffians you know, all the Ruffians out there who have interesting tastes and maybe enjoy things like the misunderstandings that were happening.

00:20:33.078 --> 00:20:33.579
Sorry?

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:34.119
Not sorry.

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:36.521
Wow!

00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:38.502
You know, FUWAMOCO.

00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:43.086
Maybe we're just getting too fast to react and setting the record straight.

00:20:43.386 --> 00:20:51.032
You know, maybe this is the power of being a member of hololive for about six months now.

00:20:53.134 --> 00:20:54.294
What do you think?

00:20:54.394 --> 00:20:56.116
It can't be!

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.817
No!

00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:58.558
No!

00:20:58.678 --> 00:20:59.438
Can't be!

00:20:59.498 --> 00:20:59.959
Good!

00:21:01.879 --> 00:21:03.240
So you are just forgetful?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.140
What?

00:21:04.741 --> 00:21:05.281
Forgetful?

00:21:05.701 --> 00:21:06.282
What do you mean?

00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:07.442
I don't know.

00:21:07.462 --> 00:21:09.303
Not forgetful, you know.

00:21:09.363 --> 00:21:11.965
I'm sure it's just some kind of strange phenomenon.

00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:12.445
Phenomenon.

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:12.625
BAU BAU!

00:21:12.665 --> 00:21:12.966
BAU BAU!

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:14.927
This is too phenomenal.

00:21:15.627 --> 00:21:16.768
Ruffians? Guess what?

00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:31.695
What?

00:21:32.756 --> 00:21:35.797
I had a bunch of dreams yesterday!

00:21:35.817 --> 00:21:39.578
It was a bit questionable though.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:42.219
So, get ready, okay?

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.120
Get ready?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.561
Explain first.

00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:52.163
I first had a bad dream where I kind of woke up in a panic because Moco-chan died in it.

00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:57.666
So naturally, Moco-chan let me into her bed until I calmed down.

00:21:57.706 --> 00:21:58.706
Yeah, because I'm good.

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:00.687
I'm a nice little sister, okay?

00:22:01.964 --> 00:22:03.406
Yeah, you know.

00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:08.634
And then, well, I got maybe a bit too comfy.

00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:10.076
She said just a bit.

00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:11.899
And I fell asleep there.

00:22:12.523 --> 00:22:15.605
Yeah, which led me to my next stream!

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:23.290
I joked that, you know, we were just about to finish the stream together with you, Ruffians!

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:29.213
But we were both so exhausted afterwards that I fell asleep before we ended things off.

00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:34.597
And we just continued sleeping for 8 hours while still alive!

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.050
Eight hours.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.071
Eight hours.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:40.251
Endurance sleep.

00:22:40.431 --> 00:22:41.531
Endurance sleep!

00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:42.692
Hi!

00:22:42.752 --> 00:22:48.654
You could hear our heavy breathing and our sleep breathing really clearly!

00:22:48.674 --> 00:22:53.935
And it was embarrassing because you could also hear our grumbly tummies too.

00:22:54.035 --> 00:22:58.117
We didn't eat dinner yesterday so it's grumbly time.

00:22:58.897 --> 00:23:05.499
You know, and sometimes I like roll over and we grumble and fight over the blankets!

00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:09.261
And I start to sleep talk too.

00:23:09.542 --> 00:23:11.283
BAU BAU.

00:23:11.363 --> 00:23:14.145
BAU BAU.

00:23:15.226 --> 00:23:22.751
I was really worried about it though, but when I woke up in my dream, apparently you really enjoyed it, Ruffians!

00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:25.053
What?!

00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:27.714
That would be a really cool stream!

00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:30.136
Next stream of the year!

00:23:31.117 --> 00:23:31.537
Huh?!

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:31.997
No way.

00:23:34.928 --> 00:23:37.369
I woke up in a dream and I was like, oh no.

00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:43.333
When I actually woke up I was like, oh my goodness.

00:23:43.653 --> 00:23:45.254
Great stream idea!

00:23:45.394 --> 00:23:46.895
New stream idea!

00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:49.496
I thought we would though.

00:23:51.337 --> 00:23:53.919
I don't want the Ruffians to hear my grumbly tummy.

00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:57.541
I guess you like that sort of idea high.

00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:00.025
Hi!

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.708
I don't know, Ruffians!

00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:03.889
Please!

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.252
BAU BAU!

00:24:08.433 --> 00:24:09.453
You have a weird high.

00:24:09.513 --> 00:24:13.517
Fuwawa is weird for having a weird dream!

00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:16.059
And the Ruffians are weird for liking it.

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:18.021
And weird for bullying me.

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:21.964
Ruffians completely forgot about my bad dream though, huh?

00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:24.166
They didn't care enough.

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:30.261
Why do you like Doggie of the Day?

00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:33.863
Yo, let's check out who is the Doggie of the Day today.

00:24:34.303 --> 00:24:44.470
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Kii!

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.171
Hi Kii!

00:24:46.231 --> 00:24:48.392
Kii is so handsome!

00:24:48.432 --> 00:24:50.734
I feel like we've had a lot of huskies, huh?

00:24:51.034 --> 00:24:52.395
Oh, well, the more huskies...

00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:54.276
I guess it is snowy.

00:24:54.516 --> 00:24:55.017
Right!

00:24:55.137 --> 00:24:59.540
Yeah, well, King is apparently a very silly rascal.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.682
I just love him very, very dearly.

00:25:03.203 --> 00:25:07.426
Yeah, he has a little hard time hearing, but that doesn't stop him at all!

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:13.891
Actually, I... Last night, cause, you know, we had to record.

00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:16.293
Fuwawa was having issues.

00:25:18.192 --> 00:25:21.153
Whenever I went, BAU BAU!

00:25:21.673 --> 00:25:27.896
At a certain frequency, you're here with me like, I can't tell what's going on.

00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:30.637
Yeah, it was just funny.

00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:33.438
It's so cute though.

00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:36.078
How in this game BAU BAU?

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:39.200
I think, I think it's, huh?

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.160
BAU BAU!

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.551
BAU BAU!

00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:43.951
That intense?

00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:45.112
Yeah, very loud.

00:25:45.192 --> 00:25:46.893
Like BAU!

00:25:46.973 --> 00:25:49.074
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:49.895 --> 00:25:50.635
No, like that.

00:25:50.835 --> 00:25:52.236
It could be that.

00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:53.056
Like that?

00:25:54.457 --> 00:25:55.698
Strong BAU BAU!

00:25:56.178 --> 00:26:00.620
That's pretty good.

00:26:01.261 --> 00:26:02.361
Like that?

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:04.643
I don't think that came BAU BAUs like that though.

00:26:06.424 --> 00:26:07.084
Then which is it?

00:26:07.544 --> 00:26:08.565
I think it's more like yours.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.031
BAU BAU!

00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:17.774
Well, you know, Kate, Kate is loving life together with you.

00:26:17.834 --> 00:26:25.639
He's ready for all the days, you know, spring, summer, fall, and especially the snowy winter ones.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.543
He's ready to have a lot of fun together with his dear Ruffians.

00:26:30.623 --> 00:26:31.303
BAU BAU!

00:26:31.664 --> 00:26:33.765
BAU BAU!

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:38.989
Now, next for today, I went on a walk

00:26:39.589 --> 00:26:40.869
We have... De-den!

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.530
Is this a walk?

00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:47.651
It's a massive moth!

00:26:48.311 --> 00:26:49.311
A massive walk!

00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:51.392
A massive walk on a massive moth?

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.392
Or a massive walk on a massive moth?

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:55.353
Which one is it?

00:26:55.393 --> 00:26:58.634
We both think moths are really cool, but... Yeah.

00:26:58.674 --> 00:27:03.195
To be honest, I think I'd probably scream if I saw this one flying around.

00:27:04.595 --> 00:27:05.015
Yeah.

00:27:05.255 --> 00:27:06.316
Moco-chan, you too?

00:27:06.876 --> 00:27:07.156
Yeah.

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:08.116
Yeah.

00:27:09.738 --> 00:27:11.919
If it's just a word, it's not that bad.

00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:13.320
It's like a bird.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.661
It's very pretty.

00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:17.342
It also looks like it has snake heads on it.

00:27:20.584 --> 00:27:21.704
I'm not a fan of that.

00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:26.047
Well, Moc-sister!

00:27:26.167 --> 00:27:29.749
We hope you had a wonderful time visiting your grandparents!

00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:33.010
We're sure you brought a big smile to their faces.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.991
BAU BAU!

00:27:36.983 --> 00:27:40.144
Next we have our Question of the Day.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.105
It is de-den!

00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:47.327
In what ways do you feel you've changed the most since your debut?

00:27:47.787 --> 00:27:54.490
It's surely been a big lifestyle switch since your time in the show, so how do you think that has affected you the most?

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.711
Ah, lifestyle switch.

00:28:04.247 --> 00:28:05.188
Ruffians!

00:28:05.768 --> 00:28:10.473
You know how hungry we were when we debuted and everything.

00:28:11.094 --> 00:28:12.635
Pretty hungry, right?

00:28:13.296 --> 00:28:16.119
No, I think we were able to show that with our actions too.

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:17.160
Hungry.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.492
You know, today!

00:28:20.393 --> 00:28:22.915
Today even marks our 250th video actually!

00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:24.357
If this happens.

00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:27.821
But to tell you the truth, Ruffians... Well...

00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:34.767
You've made us even hungrier now.

00:28:34.787 --> 00:28:35.648
Oops!

00:28:36.508 --> 00:28:39.210
So we want to keep aiming as high as we can.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:44.453
You know, pushing through the tough times so that we can make some amazing things happen all together.

00:28:44.913 --> 00:28:50.836
So you know, we're just continuing to run just as fast as we have since we debuted back in July.

00:28:51.157 --> 00:28:54.018
