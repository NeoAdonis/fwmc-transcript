05:20.770 --> 05:22.471

05:23.071 --> 05:25.413
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:25.833 --> 05:28.415
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.615 --> 05:30.577
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.617 --> 05:31.657
BAU BAU!

05:33.098 --> 05:38.421
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.501 --> 05:40.822
BAU BAU!

05:41.023 --> 05:49.587
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for the 112th episode and one year!

05:50.127 --> 05:55.270
One year since the very beginning of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:55.370 --> 05:56.251
BAU BAU!

05:59.018 --> 05:59.499
Right!

05:59.519 --> 06:02.108
Our anniversary episode!

06:02.168 --> 06:02.569
Right!

06:02.589 --> 06:03.452
Can you believe it?

06:04.281 --> 06:07.002
We've got 112 episodes in one year.

06:07.503 --> 06:08.483
One year.

06:08.723 --> 06:09.664
BAU BAU!

06:09.724 --> 06:11.765
BAU BAU!

06:12.385 --> 06:14.507
I can't believe it, Ruffians!

06:14.947 --> 06:18.329
But thank you so much for joining us!

06:18.609 --> 06:21.270
Waking up maybe some early some mornings.

06:21.290 --> 06:21.871
Right!

06:21.911 --> 06:24.372
Maybe kind of not quite making it out of bed on some.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.554
But thank you for just allowing us to see you.

06:27.874 --> 06:31.816
We're singing in the morning and allowing us to protect your smile too.

06:31.836 --> 06:33.097
For a whole year.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.480
BAU BAU!

06:36.660 --> 06:48.571
Well, for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

06:49.011 --> 06:50.673
And it's hosted by us!

06:51.413 --> 06:52.833
FUWAMOCO!

06:52.853 --> 06:58.955
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:59.315 --> 07:01.395
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

07:01.815 --> 07:03.176
Hashtag.

07:03.196 --> 07:04.956
FWMCMORNING!

07:05.376 --> 07:09.597
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:10.097 --> 07:12.758
BAU BAU!

07:14.918 --> 07:16.738
It's time to BAU BAU, Ruffians!

07:17.038 --> 07:19.019
Has it been started on the right paw?

07:21.230 --> 07:28.172
Well, it's gonna be a super exciting and fun day today, Ruffians!

07:28.612 --> 07:30.112
So... Get ready!

07:30.172 --> 07:30.632
BAU BAU!

07:30.652 --> 07:44.735
Well, uh... Speaking of starting it out on the right paw... I think there's been another Pero Sighting.

07:44.915 --> 07:46.736
What, what, what, what?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.741
I thought we were gonna start this off on the right paw, Moco-chan.

07:53.122 --> 07:54.282
No, Pero Sighting.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.724
Let's wear... Let's wear Pero!

07:58.744 --> 07:58.784
No!

08:01.005 --> 08:02.606
Let's see where he went.

08:03.226 --> 08:03.847
Or went so on.

08:04.527 --> 08:04.927
Okay.

08:05.107 --> 08:05.307
On.

08:06.728 --> 08:06.808
On.

08:06.848 --> 08:10.029
De-den, Moco-chan.

08:10.110 --> 08:10.470
De-den!

08:10.550 --> 08:10.590
On!

08:18.075 --> 08:19.015
Hello, Moco-chan.

08:20.056 --> 08:23.537
De-den!

08:24.617 --> 08:26.177
Maybe try once more, Moco-chan.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.878
De-den!

08:30.458 --> 08:30.718
Huh?

08:32.539 --> 08:32.839
Huh?

08:34.199 --> 08:37.440
W-w-where's Pero?

08:38.341 --> 08:39.001
Goodwillins.

08:40.421 --> 08:40.601
Huh?

08:40.761 --> 08:41.461
Goodwillins!

08:42.642 --> 08:44.302
Ruffians!

08:44.642 --> 08:46.863
I don't know.

08:47.742 --> 08:53.005
You know, it has been a year now since we debuted, right?

08:54.045 --> 09:00.149
Could it be that maybe Pero finally decided to not show up anymore?

09:00.849 --> 09:01.269
Right?

09:01.389 --> 09:02.070
Right, yeah.

09:02.570 --> 09:05.611
He hasn't really been showing his face around here at all for a while, you know?

09:05.892 --> 09:09.113
You've been seeing him, but... Us?

09:10.394 --> 09:10.794
Right.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.455
You know?

09:14.116 --> 09:14.356
Well...

09:15.998 --> 09:17.679
It's a miracle!

09:17.699 --> 09:17.999
It's a miracle!

09:18.059 --> 09:20.760
Behind you... You say that all the time!

09:20.780 --> 09:21.860
He's not behind us!

09:21.880 --> 09:22.520
Nobody's behind us!

09:22.580 --> 09:24.261
Nobody's behind us, okay?

09:24.601 --> 09:25.762
Yeah... Right?

09:25.862 --> 09:29.503
Maybe, you know... This could be it?

09:29.663 --> 09:34.685
Maybe he went back to the Northwest Passage and... It's just... Just going into a quiet environment.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.006
Retired like a father, too.

09:36.026 --> 09:37.626
But he's gone now.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.307
Now he's retired at the very least.

09:39.567 --> 09:40.507
He's gone.

09:40.647 --> 09:41.288
He's gone.

09:41.968 --> 09:42.268
Yeah...

09:45.150 --> 09:45.590
I don't know.

09:46.031 --> 09:46.911
It was a good one!

09:46.952 --> 09:47.992
Yeah, Peron!

09:48.052 --> 09:48.953
Yeah!

09:49.373 --> 09:49.674
Right!

09:49.934 --> 09:51.015
Wait, Ruffians!

09:51.515 --> 09:53.657
You're not sad, right?

09:54.377 --> 09:54.878
Right?

09:56.139 --> 09:57.400
Justice captured him!

09:57.420 --> 09:59.081
Oh, he's stronger than that.

09:59.181 --> 09:59.722
Okay.

10:01.523 --> 10:02.084
Moco-chan.

10:02.844 --> 10:07.088
Ruffians look a little bit sad.

10:09.590 --> 10:09.710
Oh.

10:11.225 --> 10:14.068
I don't like it when the Ruffians are sad though.

10:14.368 --> 10:15.990
It's been a year, you know.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.132
A year.

10:18.152 --> 10:23.417
Pero's an old dog and that's why he's so nasty.

10:24.077 --> 10:25.819
So, you have to save him!

10:25.839 --> 10:27.781
You're crying for Pero!

10:28.181 --> 10:29.562
The tears are a waste!

10:32.345 --> 10:33.386
It's okay, Ruffians.

10:33.426 --> 10:34.067
It's his time.

10:35.975 --> 10:36.696
BAU BAU!

10:36.756 --> 10:38.637
BAU BAU!

10:38.877 --> 10:39.778
He's having fun.

10:40.158 --> 10:41.499
He's retired somewhere.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.262
BAU BAU!

10:45.582 --> 10:46.663
Great paw stuff.

10:46.983 --> 10:47.564
Yeah!

10:48.164 --> 10:53.808
Today it's our first anniversary, the one year of FUWAMOCO Morning.

10:54.329 --> 10:58.692
And you know, something that we also shared with you Ruffians,

10:59.332 --> 11:03.534
One year ago, there's been some really good news!

11:04.134 --> 11:10.436
Our cover of Kaibutsu has hit 5 million views on YouTube!

11:10.516 --> 11:13.577
BAU BAU!

11:13.657 --> 11:16.058
Thank you so much for this!

11:16.158 --> 11:16.618
BAU BAU!

11:18.619 --> 11:19.520
5 million!

11:19.560 --> 11:23.222
It means so much to us, Ruffians!

11:23.503 --> 11:27.746
We put so much of ourselves into singing kaibutsu.

11:28.006 --> 11:31.668
We really wanted to be FUWAMOCO.

11:32.069 --> 11:39.053
And we wanted to share, you know, just how fluffy and fuzzy and how hungry we are together with you, Ruffians.

11:39.133 --> 11:43.356
So, thank you so much for listening to more tonight!

11:45.696 --> 11:54.378
FUWAMOCO, we're gonna continue to do our best to make things, you know, the FUWAMOCO way.

11:54.898 --> 11:55.518
Make it ours.

11:56.318 --> 12:02.380
And hopefully, in our second year, we can release lots more music too.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.280
More songs, more covers.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.141
Especially if you continue to support us.

12:07.201 --> 12:09.622
Lots and lots of love for music.

12:09.942 --> 12:12.282
Please take a listen if you haven't, okay?

12:12.382 --> 12:14.603
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

12:14.943 --> 12:15.603
BAU BAU!

12:16.184 --> 12:19.867
Speaking of music, we talked about it last week.

12:20.007 --> 12:20.288
Other day.

12:33.634 --> 12:39.617
The other day, Advent's new original song, Sirens, was just released.

12:40.077 --> 12:42.218
Ruffians, you've had to listen to it, right?

12:42.358 --> 12:43.939
Maybe a couple times now.

12:44.579 --> 12:46.440
Because we couldn't talk to you.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.642
There's a little bit of a secret part in it.

12:50.882 --> 12:52.043
Did you figure it out?

12:52.243 --> 12:52.823
Yeah.

12:53.323 --> 12:55.504
It's a whole big part, Ruffians.

12:55.544 --> 12:56.845
Yeah, the secret part.

12:57.325 --> 12:58.106
The funny part.

12:58.446 --> 12:59.346
The goofy part.

12:59.366 --> 13:00.767
What is the goofy part?

13:01.785 --> 13:04.046
I'm so surprised the Ruffians didn't notice yet.

13:04.066 --> 13:05.366
I haven't seen it yet.

13:05.426 --> 13:06.967
The Moon After Lightning!

13:06.987 --> 13:09.108
What are you talking about?

13:09.268 --> 13:10.628
Are you making things up?

13:10.989 --> 13:12.109
Hit me, I'll hit back.

13:12.329 --> 13:12.589
Huh?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.590
That's how the song goes.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.591
Hit me, I'll hit back.

13:17.611 --> 13:18.311
BAU BAU BAU.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.572
Just like that.

13:21.212 --> 13:22.373
Yeah, the topped up vocals.

13:22.413 --> 13:23.813
Nope, that's just normal.

13:24.694 --> 13:26.555
Secret Pero Pero's not singing in it.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.855
That is not a part of Advent!

13:28.915 --> 13:29.436
No!

13:29.656 --> 13:29.896
Yeah.

13:31.955 --> 13:33.176
Oh yeah, Moco-chan.

13:33.616 --> 13:35.797
Is that what FUWAMO makes it this time?

13:35.877 --> 13:36.317
No?

13:37.818 --> 13:38.839
It's right in your face.

13:40.120 --> 13:40.920
You didn't notice.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.341
Ruffians!

13:42.741 --> 13:45.423
You know the part where Biboo and Shiori are singing?

13:45.883 --> 13:50.386
You know the... Turn it up a notch, make it dangerous.

13:50.786 --> 13:54.228
Drifting through the night, we're outrageous.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.810
Cursing through our veins, you can't tame us.

13:58.230 --> 14:01.312
Turn it up a notch, make it dangerous.

14:10.772 --> 14:11.733
Did you realize?

14:11.753 --> 14:14.696
Sticking out your jaw for no reason.

14:14.756 --> 14:16.278
You're so BAU BAU.

14:16.318 --> 14:17.539
You're so bibutak.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.420
I just wanna be your Shiori.

14:30.808 --> 14:31.588
It's true!

14:31.728 --> 14:33.688
It's true, Ruffians!

14:34.408 --> 14:35.209
Yeah!

14:35.469 --> 14:36.209
Oh no!

14:36.689 --> 14:38.189
Oh no!

14:39.470 --> 14:43.390
Now you'll never ever be able to un-cute Ruffians!

14:44.251 --> 14:44.991
Yeah!

14:45.711 --> 14:50.352
Actually, we didn't realize until people sang it for us.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.213
Yeah, we were like... Huh?

14:53.673 --> 14:54.393
Huh?

14:57.134 --> 15:00.457
It was already done and everything.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.002
We got you Ruffians!

15:07.042 --> 15:10.485
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

15:10.866 --> 15:11.666
That's funny.

15:11.886 --> 15:14.328
That just means you have to listen to it again.

15:14.809 --> 15:15.589
Then you'll hear it.

15:16.190 --> 15:16.690
Yeah.

15:16.710 --> 15:16.891
Yeah.

15:17.371 --> 15:17.811
Yeah.

15:22.512 --> 15:24.253
FUWAMOCO You didn't hear it?

15:24.353 --> 15:25.913
FUWAMOCO Yeah, Advent, I'll try unhearing you.

15:25.933 --> 15:26.673
FUWAMOCO Right!

15:27.173 --> 15:27.714
Right!

15:27.734 --> 15:29.554
FUWAMOCO Can't escape.

15:29.654 --> 15:32.375
FUWAMOCO You cannot escape.

15:32.455 --> 15:34.676
FUWAMOCO BAU BAU!

15:34.776 --> 15:38.597
FUWAMOCO I can't believe it took you so long, Ruffians!

15:38.637 --> 15:41.578
FUWAMOCO We just had to sing it once, we didn't even do anything.

15:41.598 --> 15:43.498
FUWAMOCO We just sung it how it is!

15:43.518 --> 15:43.859
FUWAMOCO Yeah!

15:44.759 --> 15:45.359
FUWAMOCO Wow.

15:46.038 --> 15:47.999
Ruffians don't have very good ears, huh?

15:48.740 --> 15:49.820
We have big ears.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.261
We didn't know this for a while either.

15:51.601 --> 15:52.482
We have big ears.

15:53.362 --> 15:54.523
BAU BAU!

15:55.704 --> 15:57.304
You've been bibotaged.

15:57.805 --> 15:58.365
BAU BAU.

15:58.485 --> 15:59.286
BAU BAU!

15:59.306 --> 16:02.547
Definitely go listen, okay?

16:02.567 --> 16:03.328
Yeah.

16:03.388 --> 16:04.529
What do you think, Ruffians?

16:04.629 --> 16:06.450
Do you like those kind of things?

16:06.630 --> 16:07.350
I like the lyrics.

16:07.470 --> 16:08.711
I like those kind of things.

16:09.751 --> 16:10.372
But...

16:11.733 --> 16:12.834
It's so ruin!

16:13.195 --> 16:21.423
Ruin in the best way possible!

16:21.443 --> 16:23.966
BAU BAU!

16:24.326 --> 16:30.233
You know, it's something special that we share all together no matter what you say, Ruffians!

16:32.640 --> 16:35.102
Everyone, enough speaking of Biboo tags!

16:35.982 --> 16:40.105
Yesterday, it was Biboo's anniversary!

16:40.465 --> 16:43.147
And so she had a really fun stream!

16:44.538 --> 16:46.800
All together with a bunch of my senpai!

16:47.180 --> 16:47.961
Singing!

16:48.141 --> 16:56.347
And, FUWAMOCO, we will be singing too, but not just us and Biboo, but with my senpai!

16:56.527 --> 16:58.869
All together!

16:58.909 --> 17:03.332
We're so happy to be able to sing with Biboo, but then Biboo will be like,

17:03.632 --> 17:05.933
Why don't we sing this all together?

17:06.373 --> 17:07.314
All four of us!

17:07.534 --> 17:12.376
So together we sung I'm Your Treasure Box by FUWAMOCO!

17:12.796 --> 17:15.937
Yeah, Biboo had a very good reason for this, right?

17:17.478 --> 17:17.818
Yeah.

17:18.858 --> 17:19.218
She did.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.439
Why is that Moco-chan?

17:21.459 --> 17:25.661
To try to become more sexy.

17:26.361 --> 17:28.222
That Moco-chan included too, right?

17:29.966 --> 17:30.286
Maybe.

17:30.506 --> 17:30.946
Yeah.

17:31.687 --> 17:33.208
Maybe not.

17:34.608 --> 17:35.509
Yeah.

17:35.969 --> 17:36.449
Right.

17:36.629 --> 17:39.791
And hopefully she did, but I don't know.

17:39.811 --> 17:42.332
I was just feeling like, aw, Biboo's so cute.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.672
Aw, she's trying.

17:44.153 --> 17:44.953
But she's cute!

17:44.973 --> 17:45.953
I liked it!

17:46.013 --> 17:46.914
It was so fun!

17:47.494 --> 17:50.836
I feel like another dream of ours came true.

17:51.096 --> 17:51.376
Right!

17:51.496 --> 17:53.717
As you know, that Mondo.

17:54.217 --> 17:54.737
White one.

17:54.958 --> 17:55.458
Which one?

17:56.342 --> 17:57.823
There's nothing of the sort.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.905
Nothing of the sort.

18:00.666 --> 18:02.768
And you know what?

18:03.028 --> 18:03.689
That one.

18:04.770 --> 18:11.916
FUWAMOCO, we got to hear Mari-senchou-senpai's beautiful voice right directly into our soul too.

18:12.256 --> 18:15.439
Of course Biboo's voice too, but we hear that kind of often too.

18:15.599 --> 18:16.120
And I love it.

18:16.140 --> 18:16.860
It was so much fun!

18:22.185 --> 18:22.486
Yeah.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.710
Please take it if you haven't or can't!

18:25.750 --> 18:30.616
Yeah, and hopefully, you know, one day, well, we're gonna sing with Biboo.

18:31.237 --> 18:32.078
The three of us.

18:32.379 --> 18:37.886
Absolutely, that's gonna happen, but it'd be nice if one day we can sing together with Morning Senpai.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.846
Good job everyone!

18:39.907 --> 18:40.187
Bye bye!

19:05.673 --> 19:12.078
Yeah, it was so much fun, but congratulations, Biboo, on your first anniversary!

19:12.158 --> 19:12.939
And of course, Shiori!

19:13.379 --> 19:14.480
And Nerissa, too!

19:14.700 --> 19:15.861
And Nerissa, too!

19:16.441 --> 19:19.083
BAU BAU!

19:19.103 --> 19:19.944
BAU BAU!

19:19.964 --> 19:26.268
Everything just flows perfectly into each other, but on the topic of Morning Sensation, but yesterday...

19:27.209 --> 19:31.253
Yesterday yesterday, two yesterdays ago, it was her birthday!

19:31.313 --> 19:35.477
And she released a brand new song!

19:35.737 --> 19:36.518
Have you listened?

19:36.618 --> 19:37.599
It's amazing!

19:37.979 --> 19:39.421
Dead Mama's Chest.

19:46.593 --> 19:48.495
It's so cool, the MV, right?

19:48.535 --> 19:49.756
It's crazy!

19:49.916 --> 19:51.998
But the song is so good too!

19:52.038 --> 19:56.042
Yeah, this song is made together with Chameleon and Toby Fox.

19:56.102 --> 19:56.703
Yeah!

19:56.963 --> 20:00.406
It sounds just like, you know, like a boss battle theme.

20:00.426 --> 20:03.289
I don't know, we both really love Mighty Buckle.

20:03.349 --> 20:06.212
I don't think you can just say the animation was really good, okay?

20:06.232 --> 20:08.494
No, the song's really good too!

20:08.534 --> 20:11.237
But I think the animation goes past just...

20:11.957 --> 20:13.178
It was really good.

20:13.218 --> 20:15.560
This is, you know, the theatrical version.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.122
A theatrical release.

20:18.503 --> 20:19.144
Before that?

20:19.184 --> 20:19.604
Before that?

20:19.644 --> 20:19.964
Beyond that?

20:19.984 --> 20:20.905
No, it's beyond.

20:21.145 --> 20:22.006
Beyond that.

20:25.728 --> 20:33.073
My favorite scenes, there's so many favorite scenes, like you just don't know what's gonna happen next, but you, they have the dragon, right, and all the scales and everything.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.974
I just, I like the smaller scenes.

20:35.794 --> 20:39.236
The amazing ones are amazing, but I think everything is nice.

20:39.737 --> 20:49.683
Like here we have Senchou-senpai with those glowing eyes, that expression, that part was... But it's sort of an answer song to Mighty Buckle, right?

20:49.703 --> 20:51.524
Maybe let's just Moco-chan your mind.

20:52.224 --> 20:52.644
I don't think so.

20:52.664 --> 20:53.964
They kind of do connect, you know?

20:53.984 --> 20:54.565
They connect.

20:54.685 --> 20:55.425
They're parts, too.

20:55.445 --> 20:56.025
They 100% connect.

20:56.305 --> 20:56.905
Yeah.

20:57.245 --> 21:00.206
And then, you know, the rose scene where the rose is like, wow.

21:00.266 --> 21:03.227
It reminded me a bit of Utena as well.

21:03.627 --> 21:04.467
She said it herself.

21:05.227 --> 21:06.487
Got you.

21:07.168 --> 21:07.488
Yes!

21:08.208 --> 21:12.029
But, you know, I really want to go back and like, I don't want to!

21:12.129 --> 21:12.849
Watch it, watch it.

21:12.869 --> 21:14.249
You know, there's a lot of thought.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.550
A lot of love that's gone into it.

21:16.570 --> 21:17.730
Amazing amount.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.030
I need to go deep into it.

21:19.370 --> 21:20.311
Amazing amount.

21:22.780 --> 21:27.381
Happy birthday, Senchou-senpai!

21:27.761 --> 21:31.262
FUWAMOCO!

21:31.823 --> 21:35.604
And not just that too, Morning Senchou-senpai is releasing an album!

21:35.664 --> 21:36.124
Right!

21:36.284 --> 21:38.504
There's so much exciting things.

21:38.745 --> 21:38.965
Yeah.

21:39.845 --> 21:40.045
But...

21:41.140 --> 21:42.100
Exciting thing!

21:42.641 --> 21:43.721
It's our story!

21:43.741 --> 21:45.962
Our anniversary!

21:46.082 --> 21:48.983
We told you, but... But it took more than you know.

21:49.323 --> 21:54.545
You know now, we spent a full year together with you, Ruffians.

21:54.745 --> 22:00.087
And now today, it's officially the start of our second year in hololive.

22:00.707 --> 22:02.647
Do you understand what that means, Ruffians?

22:04.008 --> 22:04.448
No!

22:05.328 --> 22:05.789
No!

22:06.029 --> 22:07.709
We're in the middle of our second year.

22:08.169 --> 22:09.550
Not the middle, we just started.

22:10.889 --> 22:11.570
That's the middle.

22:11.590 --> 22:16.460
Can you believe that?

22:17.983 --> 22:19.987
I can't believe it's already been a year.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.097
I don't understand anything.

22:23.737 --> 22:26.338
Sometimes I feel that way too.

22:27.218 --> 22:27.438
Yeah!

22:27.458 --> 22:27.518
But!

22:27.778 --> 22:30.298
But, you know, it's our first anniversary.

22:30.338 --> 22:31.419
Today is the day.

22:31.719 --> 22:34.359
So we're gonna be having a big celebration!

22:34.419 --> 22:37.640
But you know, yesterday we had a bit of a countdown.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.300
So we could spend the exact moment with you!

22:40.320 --> 22:42.080
Yeah, say goodbye to our first year.

22:42.141 --> 22:44.181
Hello to the second year together!

22:44.201 --> 22:44.261
But!

22:45.661 --> 22:48.662
We had a bit of a... Something special.

22:49.142 --> 22:49.582
Right!

22:50.442 --> 22:50.662
Huh?

22:52.079 --> 22:56.241
You might have found out what the little mysterious thing on our schedule was.

22:56.261 --> 22:59.102
Tomorrow, or tomorrow, today!

22:59.142 --> 23:00.083
Today!

23:00.143 --> 23:01.303
Today!

23:01.323 --> 23:01.483
At 8.30pm P.T.

23:02.404 --> 23:03.644
FUWAMOCO!

23:03.684 --> 23:07.026
We're releasing our first original song!

23:07.146 --> 23:08.327
Yeah!

23:08.427 --> 23:09.087
BAU BAU!

23:11.705 --> 23:14.806
Just a few hours from now, Ruffians!

23:26.610 --> 23:32.136
It'll be shared with you very soon, so please join us for a celebration!

23:32.156 --> 23:35.079
We have a bunch of exciting things too, right?

23:35.119 --> 23:41.486
You know, of course we're gonna do the FUWAMOCO things, whatever those are.

23:41.526 --> 23:43.188
The real stuff.

23:43.568 --> 23:45.050
You know, some surprises as well.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.051
But, you know...

23:51.064 --> 23:56.488
We also have some special FUWAMOCO stuff coming out!

23:56.548 --> 23:59.390
That you'll definitely, definitely, definitely want to be there for.

23:59.430 --> 23:59.890
I'm so excited.

23:59.910 --> 24:02.252
Special merchandise.

24:03.073 --> 24:03.453
Good!

24:03.553 --> 24:07.476
You know, our birthday, there's a bunch of exciting things.

24:07.556 --> 24:07.696
Yeah!

24:08.016 --> 24:11.639
For weeks, you know, we had the Ruffian plushies and everything.

24:11.699 --> 24:12.019
Yeah!

24:12.039 --> 24:14.661
But this time... I wonder what we have, huh?

24:14.681 --> 24:17.363
I know, and limited signatures too.

24:17.603 --> 24:17.983
Right.

24:18.183 --> 24:19.664
But this time, a little bit different.

24:19.744 --> 24:20.005
Huh?

24:21.125 --> 24:28.269
But we worked really hard trying to get the best, best, best merchandise!

24:28.309 --> 24:32.712
That'll make you lotsa happy.

24:33.112 --> 24:36.915
We hope that you'll look forward to the big surprise too!

24:37.315 --> 24:39.376
BAU BAU!

24:39.396 --> 24:43.559
It starts at 10 AM TST!

24:43.579 --> 24:45.780
6 PM PST!

24:45.800 --> 24:47.962
So we hope that you'll be able to be

24:48.905 --> 24:52.927
Then, to say... HAPPY BIRTHDAY NUMBER THREE!

24:52.947 --> 24:55.588
To all FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

24:55.728 --> 24:56.928
Oh, you'll never miss it!

24:57.068 --> 24:59.529
BAU BAU!

24:59.549 --> 25:00.149
BAU BAU!

25:00.409 --> 25:02.230
You can make it!

25:02.890 --> 25:05.031
BAU BAU!

25:05.051 --> 25:06.912
We're gonna do our best.

25:07.052 --> 25:09.533
It's a special birthday number three.

25:10.533 --> 25:11.395
BAU BAU!

25:24.948 --> 25:29.993
New adventures together too, so... BAU BAU!

25:31.755 --> 25:38.883
But, you know, there's a lot of exciting things going on, but you know, maybe there's some rough things to have light.

25:39.423 --> 25:41.525
You know, it's Wednesday.

25:41.545 --> 25:45.169
You just want it to be a weekend at this point, right?

25:45.249 --> 25:47.071
But, what about Wednesday?

25:49.185 --> 25:53.366
At least, at the very least, you know there's a party that you can go to after everything.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.528
After the day, after you know you're like, I'm done with this.

25:57.108 --> 25:57.488
Right.

25:57.828 --> 25:58.368
What?

25:58.428 --> 25:59.128
Pup Talk.

25:59.709 --> 26:00.029
Hai!

26:00.409 --> 26:06.351
Moco-chan, do you have something to make the day a little bit more... Buzzy.

26:06.671 --> 26:07.171
Puzzy.

26:08.311 --> 26:09.352
You want fuzzy?

26:09.532 --> 26:10.472
We want fuzzy!

26:10.612 --> 26:11.192
BAU BAU!

26:11.673 --> 26:12.613
BAU BAU!

26:17.015 --> 26:17.959
Ruffians!

26:17.979 --> 26:20.247
It's that time again!

26:20.267 --> 26:22.696
You know what time it is.

26:24.592 --> 26:29.935
It hasn't been a full year of them yet, but uh... It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

26:30.496 --> 26:34.818
And you're gonna hear straight from me, Mococo!

26:34.838 --> 26:39.781
Uh, so uh... Somehow, we've got here!

26:40.342 --> 26:46.125
An actual, whole, crazy, amazing year as members of hololive!

26:46.646 --> 26:50.528
You know, uh, throughout a year, we've accomplished a lot!

26:51.028 --> 26:52.789
I mean, lots of amazing memories!

26:53.410 --> 26:53.570
But...

26:54.243 --> 27:01.005
I think for most demon dogs out there, the idea of all the pressure and that sort of thing could be sort of overwhelming.

27:02.145 --> 27:07.787
But the most important thing is actually just taking everything just a step at a time.

27:09.947 --> 27:11.548
We have no clue what we're doing.

27:12.788 --> 27:13.548
No clue!

27:14.108 --> 27:16.309
But we're just going forward and doing our best.

27:16.989 --> 27:20.390
You know, a step every day gets you somewhere eventually.

27:21.030 --> 27:21.971
You don't need to rush.

27:22.891 --> 27:23.131
Although,

27:23.927 --> 27:28.111
We do tend to rush ourselves, but that's just because we're hungry, you know?

27:29.012 --> 27:29.613
Normal, huh?

27:31.014 --> 27:37.841
Anyways, just remember that you can't rush your journey, and that slowly growing and gaining experience is so important!

27:38.782 --> 27:40.784
You can't know everything all at once, okay?

27:41.567 --> 27:45.109
You need to set realistic expectations for yourself and what you can do.

27:45.989 --> 27:51.452
You know, otherwise you'll just disappoint yourself needlessly when you're actually doing an amazing job, okay?

27:51.992 --> 27:55.014
So, don't disregard your hard work and accomplishments.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.997
It's good to do your best, but make sure to rest too, okay?

28:01.217 --> 28:04.579
Let's keep on doing our best into the second year together, okay?

28:04.599 --> 28:05.960
We can do it!

28:06.520 --> 28:08.081
Ganbatte ne!

28:08.181 --> 28:08.581
BAU BAU!

28:10.767 --> 28:13.148
BAU BAU!

28:13.168 --> 28:16.630
Abyss, that's the pup talk.

28:16.791 --> 28:17.831
How about that?

28:17.891 --> 28:20.993
BAU BAU!

28:21.233 --> 28:23.955
Well, let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

28:24.475 --> 28:29.338
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

28:29.758 --> 28:30.559
BAU BAU!

28:30.879 --> 28:34.641
It's... It's Amber!

28:34.701 --> 28:36.542
BAU BAU!

28:38.603 --> 28:39.684
That's some silly eyes.

28:40.044 --> 28:40.765
Right!

28:41.685 --> 28:43.586
Big eyes!

28:43.666 --> 28:44.687
BAU BAU!

28:45.067 --> 28:47.188
Abyss here really likes swimming.

28:47.569 --> 28:52.211
And actually was trying to influence her little sister to go to the water too.

28:52.231 --> 28:57.154
But Blondie... Blondie just wanted to chase the leaves.

28:57.655 --> 29:01.157
They can be interesting, but... Panda dog!

29:01.677 --> 29:02.678
BAU BAU!

29:04.719 --> 29:05.619
Sorry, Bonnie.

29:05.939 --> 29:10.540
You know, I guess it's your older sister's day to be the Doggie of the Day today.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.221
Congrats, Amber!

29:13.321 --> 29:14.541
BAU BAU!

29:14.601 --> 29:16.522
Panda in disguise!

29:16.982 --> 29:17.242
Right?

29:17.282 --> 29:18.962
The dog is smiling, right?

29:19.362 --> 29:22.843
Because Amber is super cute.

29:22.903 --> 29:25.104
Moco-chan, how does Amber BAU BAU?

29:26.604 --> 29:27.284
BAU BAU.

29:27.924 --> 29:28.924
Oh, BAU BAU.

29:29.905 --> 29:30.465
BAU BAU!

29:35.827 --> 29:37.328
How does Amber BAU BAU?

29:38.329 --> 29:39.209
Moco-chan!

29:39.469 --> 29:42.251
Are you troubled right now?

29:42.331 --> 29:42.891
I'm troubled.

29:43.372 --> 29:44.572
How does Amber BAU BAU?

29:45.193 --> 29:46.133
BAU BAU.

29:46.594 --> 29:47.094
BAU BAU.

29:48.108 --> 29:49.128
BAU BAU!

29:49.809 --> 29:50.409
BAU BAU!

29:51.749 --> 29:53.010
You heard her, Ruffians!

29:53.050 --> 29:54.650
That's how Amber BAU BAUs!

29:55.290 --> 29:56.971
BAU BAU!

29:57.331 --> 29:59.212
Yeah, a little smirk there.

29:59.352 --> 29:59.732
Right?

30:00.292 --> 30:01.813
So cute!

30:02.593 --> 30:10.355
You know, Amber, Amber, she's always trying to share the way to be the best doggie possible with her little sister.

30:11.076 --> 30:14.877
But, I think it's maybe proving to be an uphill battle.

30:16.266 --> 30:18.211
I understand that feeling, Amber.

30:18.772 --> 30:18.913
Yeah.

30:19.013 --> 30:20.777
We're really similar.

30:22.078 --> 30:29.085
But if you keep on doing your best, you'll be the Doggie of the Day every day for your Ruffians!

30:29.265 --> 30:30.406
Do your best, okay?

30:30.426 --> 30:33.990
BAU BAU!

30:35.671 --> 30:39.255
I love Amber's beautiful brown eyes too.

30:40.036 --> 30:42.178
So cute!

30:42.798 --> 30:43.339
Panda.

30:43.759 --> 30:44.240
Shiori.

30:44.500 --> 30:44.760
Nope.

30:45.000 --> 30:45.841
Doggie of the Day.

30:45.861 --> 30:46.061
Amber.

30:47.043 --> 30:48.224
BAU BAU.

30:48.364 --> 30:50.285
And for today I went on a walk!

30:50.485 --> 31:01.112
We have De-den!

31:01.252 --> 31:04.334
It's all the same but from different seasons.

31:05.935 --> 31:08.256
That's so special!

31:08.296 --> 31:13.897
You know, especially sharing it with us after the first year we spent together has ended.

31:13.977 --> 31:14.997
All the seasons.

31:16.197 --> 31:21.259
It really paints an amazing picture of all the seasons we've spent together.

31:21.639 --> 31:25.300
And you know, it also just shows how many walks you've been on too!

31:25.420 --> 31:26.780
That too, you know.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.820
Showing the truth.

31:29.300 --> 31:29.921
The truth!

31:30.041 --> 31:30.161
Hi!

31:30.181 --> 31:32.501
BAU BAU!

31:32.521 --> 31:34.982
You're very sweet, huh?

31:35.022 --> 31:35.742
Thank you!

31:36.102 --> 31:37.122
It means a lot.

31:37.222 --> 31:40.023
BAU BAU!

31:40.383 --> 31:45.845
And next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

31:46.245 --> 31:47.445
Hi FUWAMOCO!

31:47.585 --> 31:48.325
Hello!

31:48.365 --> 31:50.786
You've been protecting our smiles for a year now.

31:51.146 --> 31:52.927
I would like to think so.

31:53.327 --> 31:59.028
Looking back on what you've done to protect our smiles so far, do you think you've done a good job?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.449
And do you still think you can do it even better?

32:01.649 --> 32:03.770
Better job of protecting our smiles!

32:03.790 --> 32:04.771
Better job!

32:05.151 --> 32:07.172
I think we have!

32:07.312 --> 32:08.613
I would like to think so, huh?

32:09.033 --> 32:13.855
We did our absolute best, you know, and we learned a lot of things this year.

32:14.656 --> 32:17.417
Became even stronger teaming goals.

32:17.697 --> 32:25.361
I think, you know, we're going to use all the experience and knowledge we gained to protect your smile even more during our second year.

32:25.762 --> 32:28.203
You know, I guess sometimes though,

32:29.420 --> 32:31.602
There will be things where we might disappoint you.

32:31.722 --> 32:33.083
Times, you know.

32:33.103 --> 32:34.445
It's just how it is.

32:36.666 --> 32:44.013
But if we do one thing you know that makes you happy, it might equally make someone else unhappy.

32:44.413 --> 32:45.234
And we can't know.

32:46.254 --> 32:48.917
All we can do is do what we think is best.

32:49.557 --> 32:51.798
You know, we're gonna do it!

32:51.838 --> 32:53.499
The FUWAMOCO way!

32:53.620 --> 32:55.040
BAU BAU!

32:55.100 --> 33:00.304
Yeah, and hopefully I'll protect your smile forever and ever, too.

33:00.504 --> 33:01.124
BAU BAU!

33:01.224 --> 33:03.405
Thank you!

33:03.506 --> 33:05.807
Thank you, Ruffians!

33:06.067 --> 33:07.088
BAU BAU!

33:11.375 --> 33:20.517
Ruffians, thank you so much for being a part, being here with us for FUWAMOCO Morning for now a full, full year!

33:20.537 --> 33:21.777
BAU BAU!

33:21.877 --> 33:23.177
Thank you!

33:23.357 --> 33:27.658
We're always waiting for you to be an even bigger part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:28.018 --> 33:38.860
So, you know, if you have a question, if you went on a walk and saw something kind of interesting, you know, maybe you saw Pero around, although I think he's in retirement, you know, if

33:39.981 --> 33:40.922
That's a doggy of a day.

33:41.122 --> 33:42.403
A doggy in your life.

33:42.943 --> 33:45.665
Please let us know with the hashtag.

33:45.765 --> 33:47.846
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

33:48.026 --> 33:50.368

33:50.908 --> 33:52.669
And for our next stream.

33:52.970 --> 33:54.691
Wow, we did talk about it.

33:54.771 --> 33:58.393
But, we have de-den!

33:58.713 --> 34:02.236
FUWAMOCO's first anniversary celebration!

34:03.417 --> 34:04.557
It's a big one, huh?

34:04.737 --> 34:05.418
Which, uh...

34:05.912 --> 34:14.577
We won't say because we already said it once and if the wolfies are kind of sleepy then that's... It's an original song.

34:14.597 --> 34:15.017
BAU BAU!

34:15.077 --> 34:16.918
But we still have more surprises!

34:16.978 --> 34:17.658
More surprises!

34:17.698 --> 34:19.019
More fun stuff!

34:19.059 --> 34:25.683
So we really hope that you'll be there so that we can share it together with you and make even more special memories too!

34:25.703 --> 34:26.003
BAU BAU!

34:30.405 --> 34:35.367
And for Ruffians, let's take another look at our schedule.

34:35.847 --> 34:40.168
On Thursday, on the 1st, we have an after party.

34:40.248 --> 34:43.189
You're forgetting after the celebration.

34:43.309 --> 34:47.470
After the celebration, you know we have an original song.

34:47.690 --> 34:52.792
And then we have a chatting, you know, this way it's gonna be easier all together.

34:53.312 --> 34:56.033
And on the Thursday, we have an after party.

34:57.951 --> 34:58.892
That's very important.

34:59.113 --> 35:00.615
Maybe we're gonna do a lot of it.

35:00.895 --> 35:06.464
A lot of chatting about, well, our original song that's very very special to us.

35:06.564 --> 35:09.588
And maybe some things you would like to know a lot, yeah?

35:09.648 --> 35:10.009
Right.

35:11.211 --> 35:12.392
Especially that, right?

35:12.472 --> 35:12.673
Yeah.

35:14.783 --> 35:16.524
Hopefully you'll join us for that.

35:16.624 --> 35:20.445
And then, on the second, we have Shiori's 3D debut!

35:20.625 --> 35:24.047
And on the third, Biboo's 3D debut!

35:24.407 --> 35:25.567
It's so soon!

35:25.647 --> 35:27.608
Our anniversary week, oh my gosh.

35:28.929 --> 35:29.469
Crazy.

35:30.049 --> 35:30.429
Fogs.

35:30.910 --> 35:31.690
Fogs, of course.

35:31.910 --> 35:32.810
Of course, Ruffians.

35:32.850 --> 35:34.051
Yeah, fogs.

35:34.191 --> 35:35.671
Who cares about a 3D debut?

35:35.832 --> 35:36.652
Fogs, huh?

35:37.833 --> 35:40.454
You know, Fogs... It was special, you know.

35:40.474 --> 35:41.854
Fogs is special.

35:41.874 --> 35:45.416
It has a lot of memories, a lot of angry memories, too.

35:46.276 --> 35:47.717
Switch was in danger, huh?

35:48.017 --> 35:49.277
Yeah.

35:49.417 --> 35:56.800
But, you know... Maybe it's a good thing that we didn't complete it because now we can play all together a year later, too.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.061
It's not like Fogs has a story, either.

35:59.241 --> 35:59.321
No.

36:00.733 --> 36:02.595
BAU BAU!

36:02.695 --> 36:08.839
