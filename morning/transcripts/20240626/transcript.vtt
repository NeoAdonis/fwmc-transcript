05:25.294 --> 05:27.915
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.955 --> 05:29.936

Thank you for waking up for us and joining us today for our 103rd episode!

05:44.681 --> 05:45.101
BAU BAU!

05:45.381 --> 05:47.542
Everything is normal.

05:55.427 --> 05:57.569
You just got up, but you just got up!

05:58.789 --> 06:00.570
That's amazing.

06:01.151 --> 06:06.574
But it's not normal because today is gonna be a good day that starts off on the right paw.

06:06.594 --> 06:09.336
I hope every day is a good day that starts off on the right paw.

06:09.516 --> 06:11.577
But it's gonna be an extra special one.

06:12.617 --> 06:14.118
Extra special normal day!

06:14.138 --> 06:14.278
BAU BAU!

06:18.421 --> 06:22.143
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:22.303 --> 06:24.204
I see a lot of new Ruffians.

06:24.284 --> 06:33.529
I think maybe some are joining us from... Five Nights at Freddy's!

06:33.629 --> 06:34.109
Is that it?

06:34.209 --> 06:35.390
Five Nights at Freddy's?

06:35.690 --> 06:37.051
From BAU BAU?

06:38.502 --> 06:40.423
From Five Nights at Freddy's.

06:40.643 --> 06:41.364
Did we say it?

06:42.385 --> 06:42.665
Yeah.

06:42.885 --> 06:43.105
Yeah.

06:43.145 --> 06:43.365
Yeah.

06:43.545 --> 06:43.825
Yeah.

06:43.906 --> 06:44.126
Yeah.

06:44.986 --> 06:46.387
BAU BAU!

06:46.427 --> 06:47.108
BAU BAU!

06:47.268 --> 06:49.349
To explain about FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:49.449 --> 06:51.390
You know it's your first time joining us.

06:51.671 --> 06:54.712
It wouldn't be good if you're confused right off the morning.

06:54.732 --> 06:54.773
No.

06:55.193 --> 07:02.237
Yeah, well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

07:02.497 --> 07:02.878
A.K.A.

07:03.038 --> 07:04.119
FUWAMOCO!

07:04.159 --> 07:05.259
Hosted by us!

07:05.279 --> 07:07.120
FUWAMOCO!

07:08.201 --> 07:13.344
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:13.545 --> 07:15.266
I'm sorry I'm busy laughing here.

07:15.546 --> 07:17.307
Why are you laughing, Moco-chan?

07:17.407 --> 07:18.728
I fused off the morning.

07:18.748 --> 07:20.929
What does that mean?

07:21.370 --> 07:27.354
But, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:27.734 --> 07:31.876
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:31.896 --> 07:32.617
BAU BAU!

07:36.219 --> 07:38.821
Ah, we skipped Nato one day!

07:38.841 --> 07:39.902
That's fine.

07:40.222 --> 07:41.103
No one will cry.

07:41.163 --> 07:43.364
No one will cry, Ruffians.

07:43.384 --> 07:45.046
Ruffians, you could've cried, right?

07:45.086 --> 07:45.606
Did we?

07:45.686 --> 07:47.908
Moco-chan, the Ruffians are crying!

07:47.988 --> 07:49.849
Did we skip Nato one day?

07:49.909 --> 07:50.329
Really?

07:50.349 --> 07:53.752
You see the Nato coming out of their eyes right now!

07:53.772 --> 07:54.692
That's not healthy.

07:54.732 --> 07:57.975
Maybe you should go to the doctor, huh?

07:58.435 --> 07:58.795
Huh?

07:58.915 --> 08:00.817
BAU BAU!

08:01.577 --> 08:02.198
BAU BAU!

08:02.238 --> 08:03.819
You're happy for Moco-chan.

08:04.179 --> 08:04.559
Thank you.

08:06.945 --> 08:15.112
Well, it's gonna be a good Wednesday, a good middle of the week.

08:15.893 --> 08:16.654
Moco-chan.

08:17.594 --> 08:18.775
Why are you making that noise?

08:19.336 --> 08:20.136
Except for this.

08:21.938 --> 08:24.000
There's been another Pero Sighting!

08:27.512 --> 08:28.073
I don't know.

08:28.093 --> 08:31.035
Every time it's a bit of a downer.

08:31.516 --> 08:34.698
But, maybe it's better to get the downers out of the way first?

08:34.779 --> 08:37.241
I feel like Pero's been kinda nice recently, you know?

08:37.261 --> 08:38.982
Not really getting in our way.

08:39.142 --> 08:40.524
Doing some nice things.

08:40.704 --> 08:41.164
Right!

08:42.065 --> 08:43.446
Ruffians, don't we like Pero?

08:43.466 --> 08:44.827
Wait, I don't know.

08:45.188 --> 08:46.389
Let's see, Ruffians!

08:46.429 --> 08:47.990
You say that right now, but...

08:49.349 --> 08:52.551
De-den!

08:52.851 --> 08:55.013
These are the Warehouse Coins!

08:55.133 --> 08:56.854
FUWAMOCO Warehouse Coins!

08:57.154 --> 08:58.635
FUWAMOCO Warehouse Coins!

08:58.675 --> 09:17.647
FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAM

09:18.445 --> 09:21.486
It also looks like you got pero.

09:25.707 --> 09:29.608
But maybe... Is this Ruffian doesn't seem to mind?

09:29.628 --> 09:31.969
Are you sure?

09:31.989 --> 09:33.269
Are you sure?

09:34.249 --> 09:37.670
You didn't feel like, ah, this is awful.

09:38.390 --> 09:41.351
Anyone else would have been better, right?

09:42.211 --> 09:42.592
Really?

09:42.612 --> 09:43.852
Really, really?

09:45.345 --> 09:47.987
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

10:15.450 --> 10:25.876
I love you.

10:27.197 --> 10:28.737
What about Mococo?

10:31.399 --> 10:34.020
What about Nerissa, ha, Moco-chan?

10:34.080 --> 10:36.121
Here's a bonerisa.

10:36.141 --> 10:38.202
I can't bonerisa.

10:44.884 --> 10:45.665
Wow.

10:46.305 --> 10:48.847
We're glad that you had amazing gacha luck.

10:48.887 --> 10:49.867
No, Moco-chan got Pero.

10:49.927 --> 10:50.708
I guess that's okay.

10:51.088 --> 10:54.190
And we hope it continues forever and ever, right?

10:55.671 --> 10:56.412
Right, Moco-chan?

10:56.432 --> 10:58.793
Okay.

10:59.134 --> 11:02.896
Yeah, because that means that this Ruffian will then get Moco-chan too, right?

11:02.956 --> 11:04.117
That's what I was thinking.

11:04.137 --> 11:04.457
Yeah.

11:05.258 --> 11:07.099
BAU BAU!

11:07.199 --> 11:08.740
I guess it's good that you got Pero.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.581
That makes you happy.

11:09.641 --> 11:11.202
BAU BAU.

11:11.362 --> 11:12.463
Forget Nerissa.

11:12.503 --> 11:12.723
BAU BAU!

11:14.935 --> 11:19.399
We're Ruffians!

11:21.461 --> 11:28.487
We might kinda have a bit of an apology to make.

11:30.269 --> 11:33.812
Ruffians, we're really really sorry.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.903
Did you know?

11:37.923 --> 11:38.823
Didn't notice.

11:38.883 --> 11:49.152
Maybe there's some Ruffians here that didn't notice, but actually, for the first time ever ever, we had to cancel a FUWAMOCO Morning.

11:49.572 --> 11:50.973
And very suddenly too.

11:51.013 --> 11:54.896
Yeah, up until now, you know, a few hours beforehand.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.117
A few hours, yeah.

11:56.397 --> 12:01.822
But up until now, you know, every single FUWAMOCO Morning, every single one since we debuted,

12:02.282 --> 12:05.486
Every single one has happened until now.

12:05.626 --> 12:08.750
We know no oversleeping, no sickness.

12:09.391 --> 12:11.534
Every single one.

12:12.014 --> 12:13.356
We power through them all.

12:13.376 --> 12:14.978
But on Monday, we had to cancel.

12:21.252 --> 12:25.073
Ruffians, there was a really really good reason though.

12:25.533 --> 12:28.754
So uh, thank you for understanding!

12:28.874 --> 12:29.554
Yeah!

12:29.674 --> 12:30.295
Yeah!

12:30.755 --> 12:31.895
You see!

12:32.235 --> 12:33.775
Wow, FUWAMOCO!

12:33.795 --> 12:36.216
It was a really crazy intense day!

12:36.276 --> 12:37.196
Crazy!

12:37.216 --> 12:38.737
FUWAMOCO!

12:39.037 --> 12:41.458
We have been up from early early morning!

12:41.498 --> 12:42.878
Really really early!

12:42.898 --> 12:46.039
Yeah, until late night working so hard!

12:46.119 --> 12:47.079
Like dogs!

12:47.199 --> 12:47.879
Like dogs!

12:47.919 --> 12:49.860
Like dogs and dogs and dogs!

12:50.520 --> 12:54.122
We're working hard all together with all of Advent too!

13:09.028 --> 13:12.651
Despite being super tired puppies, you know, we're like, okay, yep.

13:12.811 --> 13:23.860
We're going to do a FUWAMOCO Morning as always, you know, because we wanted to make sure to start the week off on the right paw together with you.

13:24.521 --> 13:25.662
That's what we had planned.

13:26.102 --> 13:27.703
You know, we even haven't had dinner.

13:28.264 --> 13:31.286
And Nerissa and Biboo are gonna go out to get something yummy.

13:31.306 --> 13:32.948
And we said, no.

13:33.749 --> 13:38.415
Like we've done many times before, you know?

13:39.376 --> 13:42.120
We have an important engagement with the Ruffians, right?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.461
But then... Actually...

13:48.829 --> 13:50.810
Suisei-senpai came in!

13:50.910 --> 13:54.371
BAU BAU!

13:54.571 --> 13:58.673
Those Suisei-senpais came in like a comet!

13:59.373 --> 14:00.314
Like a comet!

14:01.094 --> 14:05.576
And it was our first time meeting Suisei-senpai and we were so surprised!

14:10.186 --> 14:10.806
Yeah.

14:11.547 --> 14:18.229
Suisei-senpai, she asked what our plans were because our busy day was now over.

14:18.329 --> 14:18.750
Yeah.

14:19.210 --> 14:22.271
And we said, you know, we have FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

14:22.291 --> 14:24.232
You know, that's what we have planned.

14:24.612 --> 14:26.153
That's what we are gonna do.

14:26.553 --> 14:32.995
But then she was like, oh, FUWAMOCO, you'll come to Yakiniku with all of us, right?

14:33.255 --> 14:33.896
Right.

14:34.896 --> 14:38.321
And Ruffians... We knew what we had to do.

14:38.341 --> 14:48.273
You know, because if THE Suisei Senpai... THE Suisei Senpai... If she asks you to dinner, what do you say, Ruffians?

14:49.594 --> 14:51.657
Are you gonna ignore our comment?

14:51.697 --> 14:52.778
You can't do that.

14:53.098 --> 14:53.359
Huh?

14:53.779 --> 14:54.100
Yeah.

14:55.316 --> 14:55.737
Yes.

14:56.377 --> 14:56.537
Yes.

14:56.738 --> 14:56.818
Yes.

14:56.858 --> 14:57.178
Yes.

14:57.539 --> 14:57.699
Yes.

14:57.759 --> 14:57.919
Yes.

15:12.054 --> 15:18.838
Yeah, we're so excited, so nervous, but really, really, really happy to have dinner with her, you know.

15:19.238 --> 15:23.480
FUWAMOCO, we really respect and admire Senpai so much.

15:23.580 --> 15:24.061
Of course.

15:24.161 --> 15:30.724
And we're really happy to be able to have the opportunity to ask her a bunch of questions!

15:30.744 --> 15:33.306
So many questions, always!

15:33.686 --> 15:36.007
We got a lot of Senpai power from her.

15:37.687 --> 15:43.288
I was sitting directly across from Suisei-senpai!

15:43.748 --> 15:52.730
And every time she cooked a piece of meat for me and put it on my plate, I felt like I was gonna cry, Ruffians!

15:52.750 --> 15:56.571
You were crying, right?

15:56.671 --> 15:58.651
I'm Suisei-senpai BAU BAU!

15:58.951 --> 16:00.172
This isn't the time for that!

16:00.192 --> 16:01.692
This isn't the time for that!

16:04.315 --> 16:07.499
FUWAMOCO, maybe we're not the best at yakiniku.

16:07.519 --> 16:10.122
We're probably not the best people to invite to yakiniku.

16:11.003 --> 16:11.644
Because I...

16:12.935 --> 16:13.676
We scream.

16:14.736 --> 16:16.778
We're babies when it comes to yakiniku.

16:16.798 --> 16:18.199
We don't know what to do.

16:18.599 --> 16:20.060
And the fire is scary.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.344
So we scream and we can't control ourselves.

16:24.864 --> 16:26.866
Suisei-senpai was laughing at us.

16:30.008 --> 16:33.951
And it's not like we were forced to go to dinner with Dai-senpai.

16:33.971 --> 16:36.353
We wanted to go, you know?

16:37.574 --> 16:37.974
Of course.

16:38.476 --> 16:38.796
Hi.

16:39.157 --> 16:48.425
And you know, it's not like there's ever gonna be another chance when we can go out to dinner with Nerissa and Biboo and Suisei-senpai!

16:48.465 --> 16:48.805
Yeah.

16:48.865 --> 16:49.826
It's very slim.

16:49.906 --> 16:50.887
Yeah.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.088
It felt like a dream.

16:52.328 --> 16:55.351
Yeah, and we wanted to take the opportunity too!

16:55.371 --> 16:55.451
Yeah!

16:55.591 --> 16:59.614
You know, cause Suisei-senpai is very, very, very cute, right?

16:59.634 --> 16:59.794
Yeah.

16:59.955 --> 17:01.716
We hope you understand, Ruffians!

17:02.176 --> 17:04.899
You know, it wasn't a decision that we made lightly.

17:04.919 --> 17:04.959
No.

17:04.979 --> 17:05.359
Uh-uh.

17:05.399 --> 17:05.479
No.

17:07.653 --> 17:14.960
But we were just really really happy because we were able to share with Suisei-senpai just how hungry we were!

17:15.320 --> 17:17.242
But not in the yakiniku way.

17:17.643 --> 17:20.445
In the ambitious way.

17:20.866 --> 17:22.607
Yeah, but we weren't hungry afterwards.

17:23.688 --> 17:25.990
We were, no, we were done.

17:26.050 --> 17:31.252
But Suisei-senpai also said that she'll be cheering us on too!

17:31.432 --> 17:33.694
And you know what?

17:33.714 --> 17:37.556
Nerissa and Biboo and I were actually laughing to each other.

17:37.976 --> 17:48.702
Because when we were walking back, Fuwawa and Suisei-senpai were walking together, and Nerissa was like, oh, it looks like they're on a date together, huh?

17:53.668 --> 17:57.791
I was trying to be the coolest demon dog I could be a Ruffian.

17:58.251 --> 18:01.594
Although I wasn't looking very cool at the time.

18:01.634 --> 18:04.415
You're probably looking like a big ball of mess, huh?

18:04.535 --> 18:06.157
I'm very sweaty.

18:08.618 --> 18:11.040
Comments are hot, you know.

18:11.540 --> 18:16.263
Thank you Suisei-senpai for treating us to delicious yakiniku!

18:16.643 --> 18:20.166
And for giving us lots of amazing advice and support!

18:20.786 --> 18:22.506
Thank you!

18:22.646 --> 18:23.807
Arigatou!

18:24.087 --> 18:32.828
That one day, maybe FUWAMOCO, we can become amazing members of hololive just like our Suisei-senpai is too.

18:33.388 --> 18:35.909
BAU BAU!

18:36.049 --> 18:37.169
Ruffians!

18:37.709 --> 18:38.529
You understand?

18:40.910 --> 18:41.510
Understandable.

18:42.710 --> 18:43.890
Understandable?

18:44.350 --> 18:45.270
BAU BAU!

18:50.059 --> 18:50.599
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.041
It feels like a dream.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.821
It felt like a dream at the moment.

18:54.921 --> 18:55.942
It feels like a dream.

18:56.002 --> 18:56.702
Ray's dream.

18:56.922 --> 18:57.483
Yeah.

18:58.283 --> 19:01.564
Ray's dreams.

19:01.744 --> 19:02.265
Yeah.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.965
Happy but strange.

19:04.045 --> 19:08.227
Speaking of dreams, over the weekend I had a really funny dream.

19:09.028 --> 19:13.630
There was a new generation of hololive English called Justice that debuted!

19:15.842 --> 19:19.084
I think there was... It wasn't a dream, Moco-chan!

19:19.244 --> 19:21.665
I think there was... Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

19:22.146 --> 19:24.507
You're over the weekend!

19:24.567 --> 19:27.068
The newest generation of hololive English!

19:27.489 --> 19:28.189
Justice!

19:28.449 --> 19:29.290
I made the debut!

19:29.330 --> 19:30.210
BAU BAU!

19:32.271 --> 19:35.053
We are officially senpai!

19:35.073 --> 19:36.214
Crazy dream, right?

19:36.234 --> 19:43.318
It was so, so nice to see you debut and get kohai!

19:43.578 --> 19:43.958
You know from...

19:44.258 --> 19:46.900
The love to be held now and then.

19:46.941 --> 19:48.822
Cecilia.

19:48.882 --> 19:50.984
Ellen Elizabeth Rose Bluffling.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.726
Ellen Gigi.

19:53.466 --> 19:54.868
Yeah!

19:54.968 --> 20:00.553
It was nice that, you know, all of Advent, we were able to do a off-cloud watch-a-meow.

20:00.593 --> 20:03.776
We had our debuters from the studio.

20:03.856 --> 20:06.078
And it was really, it was just so nice.

20:06.158 --> 20:08.260
It was very cute to see them do their best.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.921
Debuting, remembering, that was us.

20:10.981 --> 20:13.381
Yeah, it made us all a bit nostalgic, huh?

20:13.601 --> 20:16.062
Yeah, this, this demon- FUWAMOCO-senpai!

20:16.082 --> 20:22.544
Yeah, this demon girl was feeling like a, a very, uh, mature puppy at that moment.

20:23.024 --> 20:24.164
Yeah.

20:24.204 --> 20:24.644
You know?

20:24.665 --> 20:26.125
Time flies, right?

20:26.885 --> 20:29.286
It was just so much fun cheering them on.

20:29.426 --> 20:29.646
Yeah!

20:29.786 --> 20:33.387
But, uh, we're definitely not gonna let them catch us, you know?

20:33.707 --> 20:35.808
But, but, you know, it needs to be said.

20:35.828 --> 20:36.308
But, but,

20:37.248 --> 20:37.789
Yeah, just like that.

20:37.809 --> 20:37.909
Yeah.

20:56.249 --> 20:58.711
That's a senpai's job, right?

20:58.892 --> 20:59.853
Yeah.

21:00.153 --> 21:04.277
Good senpai behavior!

21:05.077 --> 21:05.798
Exactly!

21:05.918 --> 21:09.181
We've already got to see so much of their personalities.

21:09.301 --> 21:09.442
Right?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.384
And they released an amazing original song too.

21:19.131 --> 21:19.651
Yeah!

21:19.891 --> 21:23.434
And, you know, Elizabeth's already done a bunch of karaoke!

21:23.494 --> 21:23.934
Right!

21:24.175 --> 21:25.936
But I was really curious!

21:26.176 --> 21:26.436
Huh?

21:26.536 --> 21:33.242
I wanna see, you know, I wanna see Elizabeth... She did a really good Alvin impersonation in BAU BAU.

21:33.662 --> 21:37.185
But I haven't seen a Pero impersonation, right?

21:37.245 --> 21:37.986
We don't need that.

21:38.486 --> 21:39.247
He's nasty.

21:39.847 --> 21:43.730
I wanna see Elizabeth's Pero impersonation, right, Ruffians?

21:45.251 --> 21:45.652
Right!

21:46.633 --> 21:46.893
Hmm...

21:48.332 --> 21:49.473
Biboonita!

21:49.793 --> 21:51.434
Biboonita!

21:51.454 --> 21:55.455
Which one is it?

21:55.756 --> 21:57.136
Cecilia too, you know?

21:57.156 --> 21:59.277
We made plans to rip off her head, right?

21:59.337 --> 22:00.938
Yes, we did make plans for that.

22:00.998 --> 22:04.900
After we rip off her head... And I had to rub our fingers on her joints.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.100
That too, I guess.

22:07.521 --> 22:13.404
But you know, I thought it'd be fun that after we try ripping off her head, then we could drink tea together and see how that goes.

22:14.424 --> 22:14.864
Right!

22:15.304 --> 22:16.445
Where would it go, huh?

22:16.605 --> 22:17.885
I don't know, we have to see!

22:17.905 --> 22:19.225
We have to try!

22:19.245 --> 22:19.345
Right!

22:19.625 --> 22:22.146
Alright!

22:23.286 --> 22:25.066
I could try something, Moco-chan.

22:27.247 --> 22:29.908
Cecelia could take a drink from the tea.

22:30.648 --> 22:33.688
And then we could see if it falls out of the neck.

22:34.189 --> 22:35.909
Then maybe we could drink from that.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.726
Wait, Ruffians!

22:39.886 --> 22:41.469
It's an idea!

22:41.529 --> 22:41.630
Yeah!

22:41.930 --> 22:42.752
An idea!

22:42.772 --> 22:42.992
Right!

22:47.904 --> 22:51.425
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

22:51.445 --> 22:52.746
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

22:52.806 --> 22:53.906
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

23:15.692 --> 23:16.772
I don't know.

23:18.913 --> 23:25.735
Maybe... You know, you power up a bit if you got some of Gigi's grammar power.

23:26.515 --> 23:27.835
I wonder how I can do that.

23:27.876 --> 23:31.717
Maybe you could just take a finger off of her something.

23:32.037 --> 23:32.617
Just a bite.

23:33.137 --> 23:34.697
BAU BAU!

23:34.757 --> 23:36.538
Good senpai, right?

23:36.598 --> 23:38.058
Thank you!

23:38.338 --> 23:39.299
Right, Ruffian?

23:39.339 --> 23:41.199
Welcome to FUWAMOCO!

23:45.281 --> 23:47.843
It's been exciting, huh, Ruffians?

23:47.943 --> 23:49.724
It's been very exciting, yeah.

23:50.064 --> 23:51.605
Just take a yobi-yobi.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.328
BAU BAU!

23:57.248 --> 24:00.650
On the topic of... Moco-chan!

24:00.831 --> 24:02.291
On the topic of exciting!

24:02.391 --> 24:05.233
On the topic of figs.

24:05.794 --> 24:07.435
No, no, no, no!

24:07.515 --> 24:09.276
This is on the topic of figs!

24:09.376 --> 24:10.757
Figs!

24:10.837 --> 24:12.758
Ruffians, we had some amazing

24:13.078 --> 24:14.099
News!

24:14.399 --> 24:17.662
We're so happy to let you know, but FUWAMOCO!

24:17.682 --> 24:21.546
We're gonna be special guests at Good Smile Company's panel at Anime Expo!

24:36.018 --> 24:38.299
Are you going to be there, Ruffians?

24:38.659 --> 24:41.480
Maybe you had some fun summer plans in LA?

24:41.500 --> 24:45.501
If you did, maybe we'll see you there!

24:45.961 --> 24:48.362
Thank you, Ruffians!

24:48.722 --> 24:54.864
We are so, so incredibly honored and just absolutely thrilled to be a part of it.

24:54.924 --> 24:56.844
You know how much we love figures, right?

24:59.785 --> 25:07.029
FUWAMOCO, since we've been small little puppies, we've actually been collecting figures, and we love them so much!

25:07.169 --> 25:11.571
And Good Smiles figures have been a very special part of our collection.

25:12.271 --> 25:21.256
Even FUWAMOCO, we remember looking at the very first Nendoroid to come out, together with the mama puppy, and we were like, oh they're so cute!

25:21.476 --> 25:23.377
So we collect them all!

25:26.192 --> 25:29.455
We decided to only get our very favorite characters.

25:29.495 --> 25:31.216
Which is a good decision.

25:31.236 --> 25:32.837
Yeah, good decision.

25:33.037 --> 25:33.658
There's over 2,000!

25:33.878 --> 25:36.320
2,000 Nendoroids!

25:37.041 --> 25:37.501
Yeah.

25:37.621 --> 25:38.282
A good decision.

25:38.502 --> 25:39.943
Good decision.

25:40.043 --> 25:43.666
Yeah, I don't have a big enough doghouse for that many Nendoroids.

25:43.686 --> 25:44.867
No, that's a lot of space.

25:45.107 --> 25:45.607
Yeah.

25:47.668 --> 25:58.392
But we'll be on the panel together with Yago-san himself and the founder of Good Smile Company, Takanori Aki.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.093
We're super novice Ruffians!

26:01.113 --> 26:02.133
What are we gonna do?

26:02.553 --> 26:06.875
What should we do to be able to share our love for figures even more, Ruffians?

26:08.977 --> 26:09.858
What are we gonna do?

26:10.138 --> 26:11.239
What are we gonna say?

26:11.819 --> 26:16.382
Because you know... I think we're gonna say a bit more than that.

26:16.402 --> 26:21.165
FUWAMOCO, what's your thoughts on this?

26:21.185 --> 26:24.888
That's it, that's it.

26:25.368 --> 26:27.129
I think we gotta do better than that.

26:27.149 --> 26:31.572
So we're gonna do our best, okay?

26:32.033 --> 26:34.094
I'll talk about your version and on.

26:34.314 --> 26:34.534
What?

26:38.316 --> 26:40.517
I know that the rarest nendoroid is Ryofuko-chan.

26:41.577 --> 26:42.218
I wanted it.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.819
It's really cute.

26:45.239 --> 26:46.299
And I like the opening theme.

26:46.619 --> 26:47.460
It's not gonna happen.

26:47.580 --> 26:48.380
Never gonna happen.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.101
But I think we have number 37.

26:50.181 --> 26:50.721
Hostile Inc.

26:58.924 --> 27:01.025
Tell them about your collection.

27:01.105 --> 27:03.767
I don't know if it's the right time for that.

27:03.787 --> 27:11.310
There's going to be announcements and prizes, so Ruffians, please don't forget about it, okay?

27:11.690 --> 27:18.453
We hope that you'll be cheering on these geeky puppies that are in FUWAMOCO one-to-one.

27:18.473 --> 27:19.574
You love too much though.

27:20.014 --> 27:23.656
Since we're making our first appearance at Anime Expo, okay?

27:23.736 --> 27:24.817
BAU BAU!

27:24.837 --> 27:29.259
Let's all show our power together, okay?

27:29.719 --> 27:30.880
BAU BAU!

27:33.212 --> 27:39.799
I'm so excited but really nervous, but I'm more excited with Ruffians!

27:40.020 --> 27:41.842
Breaking Dimensions!

27:42.602 --> 27:43.643
BAU BAU!

27:43.683 --> 27:49.590
hololive English's second content, Breaking Dimensions, is happening in August.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.371
August 24th and 25th.

27:52.032 --> 27:55.094
Anyways, we just announced that there's gonna be some guests!

27:55.435 --> 27:58.717
First we have Kobo-senpai announced!

27:59.117 --> 28:00.979
And now Muna-senpai!

28:01.059 --> 28:04.021
And there's two more interesting shapes here.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.443
Oh, this shape's called senpai.

28:06.923 --> 28:07.664
Senpai shapes.

28:08.444 --> 28:10.025
Who do you think these senpai shapes are?

28:10.286 --> 28:10.966
Ruffians!

28:12.587 --> 28:13.468
Two more?

28:13.628 --> 28:14.669
Lump and Lumpy.

28:15.279 --> 28:16.079
Lumpy Lumpy.

28:16.099 --> 28:18.680
A slime.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.161
Yes, a slime.

28:20.581 --> 28:21.121
Pero!

28:22.341 --> 28:23.462
I don't think it's Pero.

28:23.582 --> 28:26.643
Why would anyone call him the guest on anything, huh?

28:26.783 --> 28:30.804
Well, I heard YMCA is Pero's favorite song to sing, right?

28:31.428 --> 28:32.108
You don't want to see that?

28:32.128 --> 28:32.929
I don't know.

28:32.969 --> 28:35.109
That would break too many dimensions, okay?

28:35.149 --> 28:36.770
That's true.

28:36.790 --> 28:42.152
Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll find out soon who these two muffy senpai shapes are.

28:43.033 --> 28:46.934
But, most importantly, Ruffians, you might have kind of let your guard down.

28:46.954 --> 28:50.195
But it's okay because these guard dogs, we have it for you.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.316
I don't want that to happen.

28:51.356 --> 28:51.416
No.

28:51.436 --> 28:51.996
Yeah, the tickets that-

28:52.176 --> 29:03.886
In-venue in-person tickets for Breaking Dimensions goes on sale on Friday the 28th at 6pm PT, 9pm EDT, or the 29th at 10am JST.

29:04.546 --> 29:05.347
Really soon!

29:05.427 --> 29:07.309
It's finally really soon!

29:07.349 --> 29:09.751
We'll remind you again next FUWAMOCO Morning.

29:17.461 --> 29:26.072
Ruffians that are a little bit far away from the King's Theatre in New York, there are online digital streaming tickets available right now.

29:27.113 --> 29:31.355
Please go get them over on the SPW and on the Spawn website.

29:31.955 --> 29:37.057
Because FUWAMOCO will be making our first concert appearance there too!

29:38.037 --> 29:38.137
Yes!

29:38.197 --> 29:38.737
Two days.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.638
Not one day, Moco-chan.

29:40.698 --> 29:41.418
Two days!

29:47.612 --> 29:54.255
And Ruffians, if you thought you know that this is an amazing concert, I gotta get a t-shirt, I gotta get some merch.

29:54.856 --> 29:59.258
Right now you can still get your merch set on the official hololive website.

29:59.818 --> 30:03.980
It's actually extended, so if you're a little forgetful, it's okay, it happens.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.683
You can still get it, but there is some unfortunate news.

30:07.923 --> 30:10.205
The sets only come with one penlight.

30:10.806 --> 30:15.730
So that means, you know, that maybe you might need two penlights.

30:15.950 --> 30:19.554
Yeah, you might need to snag a friend's penlight.

30:19.614 --> 30:21.696
Excuse me, I would like to borrow that there.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.477
Buy two sets.

30:23.658 --> 30:25.579
Or you could always make your own penlight.

30:25.779 --> 30:26.100
Yeah!

30:26.440 --> 30:29.241
We are alright.

30:29.541 --> 30:30.641
Lots of ideas!

30:30.781 --> 30:33.202
You can't have blue and pink at the same time.

30:33.222 --> 30:35.282
You need two.

30:36.402 --> 30:36.862
Okay.

30:37.462 --> 30:40.583
There's still some time to figure out what to do with the dilemma.

30:40.623 --> 30:42.204
Make your choices!

30:42.764 --> 30:47.185
We hope that you look forward to it just as much as we are, Ruffians!

30:47.205 --> 30:47.825
BAU BAU!

30:50.611 --> 30:57.297
Is this something exciting, Moco-chan?

30:57.517 --> 30:58.918
Is this something sad?

31:22.233 --> 31:25.215
Well, we have some news, Ruffians.

31:26.055 --> 31:27.096
Biboo was kidnapped.

31:27.776 --> 31:28.557
She was kidnapped.

31:28.577 --> 31:29.037
Kidnapped.

31:29.217 --> 31:30.738
Kidnapped for good this time.

31:31.178 --> 31:31.659
Yeah.

31:32.539 --> 31:33.059
Yeah.

31:33.240 --> 31:33.580
Yeah.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.541
I swear that it's a bit alarming.

31:36.261 --> 31:36.722
Yeah.

31:36.802 --> 31:37.622
She was kidnapped.

31:39.123 --> 31:41.385
Before Justice made their debut,

31:42.165 --> 31:45.308
Biboo was kidnapped by a group of criminals.

31:45.328 --> 31:47.990
Innocent criminals called Advent.

31:49.632 --> 31:53.896
We had to kidnap her away from the pebbles while she was playing Elden Ring.

31:53.916 --> 31:58.580
You know, cause she was having a lot of fun and then there was a legend of boss.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.943
Yeah, you might not have heard it, but we broke down the door.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.084
We broke down the door.

32:04.065 --> 32:04.966
We stormed the room!

32:04.986 --> 32:07.768
We stormed the room and told her, you have to get out!

32:08.028 --> 32:10.089
I'm gonna turn off the computer!

32:10.349 --> 32:12.311
And we even tickled her, Ruffians.

32:12.351 --> 32:13.311
We even tickled her.

32:13.331 --> 32:14.792
In a ticklish spot.

32:15.052 --> 32:15.413
Yeah!

32:15.573 --> 32:17.554
And she... She was gaming.

32:18.255 --> 32:19.435
She did not react.

32:19.475 --> 32:20.456
She was a rock.

32:20.656 --> 32:22.317
Somehow that's surprising.

32:22.337 --> 32:22.417
Yeah.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.359
Yeah.

32:24.699 --> 32:27.501
I don't know, when Biboo's gaming, she is gaming.

32:28.081 --> 32:33.845
And I think Pebbles already realized this, but Biboo gaming is very cute.

32:36.286 --> 32:37.927
But she was also sweating a lot too.

32:38.048 --> 32:38.288
What?!

32:38.428 --> 32:41.570
But that might have had to do with the fact that she was getting kidnapped by Alphys.

32:41.590 --> 32:41.930
And tickled!

32:41.950 --> 32:43.431
Yeah, yeah.

32:43.551 --> 32:49.014
I did think, you know, I'm gonna pull the chair away, but I decided that that's maybe a bit too cool.

32:49.195 --> 32:51.116
I know we talked about wanting to do that.

32:51.656 --> 32:55.399
She's almost done with the boss, so... We showed mercy.

32:55.479 --> 32:59.181
Just in time, Biboo was able to fell the hajimaru.

32:59.362 --> 33:01.843
And made it in time for Justice's debut.

33:03.545 --> 33:09.709
But if you want to hear what it sounds like for Advent to kidnap Biboo, go check it out.

33:09.849 --> 33:10.369
BAU BAU!

33:19.259 --> 33:23.082
Ruffians, how has the week been going so far?

33:23.102 --> 33:26.925
Hopefully you have some more energy.

33:27.705 --> 33:31.768
But maybe you need a little bit of a push too.

33:32.489 --> 33:34.070
Pick me up.

33:34.631 --> 33:37.593
Moco-chan, you're still sleepy.

33:37.993 --> 33:38.794
A bit rough.

33:40.155 --> 33:41.216
Tough but going.

33:41.496 --> 33:42.076
I get it.

33:42.096 --> 33:42.837
It's been alright.

33:43.447 --> 33:44.888
Could be better though, right?

33:45.448 --> 33:48.651
Well, maybe you need a bit of a talk then!

33:48.671 --> 33:54.955
Ruffians!

33:56.556 --> 33:58.657
It's that time again!

33:58.677 --> 34:00.739
You're right!

34:01.579 --> 34:04.181
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

34:04.921 --> 34:07.343
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

34:07.783 --> 34:08.104
Mococo!

34:12.210 --> 34:13.951
How are things been going, Ruffians?

34:15.752 --> 34:21.236
You know, before we even realized it, it seems like we're in the thick of summer already!

34:21.256 --> 34:25.319
Are you keeping your energy levels up?

34:26.800 --> 34:29.481
You won't let the heat and the humidity zap it from you, right?

34:30.542 --> 34:30.882
Right?

34:32.784 --> 34:38.828
One thing that's important is that you make sure to keep yourself refreshed by not only just drinking water,

34:39.718 --> 34:43.020
But by keeping up with trying out new things every now and then too.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.082
You know?

34:46.122 --> 34:53.767
It's always a great feeling of accomplishment when you can give yourself a pat on the back after trying something that was, uh, maybe a bit scary.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.729
You know?

34:56.609 --> 34:57.510
I know you can do it.

34:58.691 --> 34:59.671
No matter what you think.

35:00.132 --> 35:00.992
You're strong!

35:01.452 --> 35:02.273
It won't faze you.

35:02.693 --> 35:06.456
In the end, you'll be glad you tried and didn't regret it.

35:06.696 --> 35:07.937
No matter the outcome, okay?

35:08.894 --> 35:11.657
So, let's take control of this summer.

35:11.677 --> 35:15.421
This summer of advent and say no!

35:16.342 --> 35:21.487
Actually, this, this is the summer of me!

35:22.788 --> 35:25.731
Let's all do our best to make it an unforgettable summer, okay?

35:26.632 --> 35:27.553
Ganbatte desu!

35:27.593 --> 35:28.554
BAU BAU!

35:30.450 --> 35:33.111
BAU BAU!

35:34.771 --> 35:42.193
The summer of Advent and the summer of you, Ruffians!

35:42.433 --> 35:43.113
BAU BAU!

35:43.173 --> 35:45.474
Wow, Moco-chan.

35:45.854 --> 35:49.255
Maybe let's take a look at... Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

35:49.395 --> 35:51.055
I feel like taking a look at the Doggie of the Day.

35:51.215 --> 35:53.916
Who's the Doggie of the Day, Moco-chan?

35:54.036 --> 35:54.996
The Doggie of the Day.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.002
We have... What?

35:58.202 --> 35:59.803
Stay foggy all the day!

35:59.843 --> 36:00.664
We have is... De-den!

36:00.724 --> 36:01.024
Winnie!

36:01.925 --> 36:02.485
Winnie!

36:02.705 --> 36:03.546
So cute!

36:03.686 --> 36:04.066
Winnie!

36:21.756 --> 36:22.817
She's goofy!

36:23.237 --> 36:24.737
And has boobies!

36:25.537 --> 36:27.678
And has butt scrunchies!

36:28.238 --> 36:32.159
And adjustable anything that can fit in her mouth!

36:32.199 --> 36:33.060
And has donuts!

36:33.220 --> 36:34.080
And you know what?

36:34.540 --> 36:35.480
I love Winnie!

36:35.560 --> 36:41.162
Oh Winnie, look at Winnie's eyes!

36:41.742 --> 36:43.083
That's a puppy!

36:43.263 --> 36:44.663
That's a puppy!

36:44.743 --> 36:46.404
Baby Fuwawa, excuse me!

36:47.705 --> 36:50.247
Little baby Mococo, hi!

36:50.267 --> 36:52.289
This is Mococo-chan!

36:52.469 --> 36:52.569
Hi!

36:52.589 --> 36:53.009
Hi!

36:53.029 --> 36:56.352
I think Winnie, Winnie, BAU BAU is like... BAU BAU!

36:56.392 --> 36:57.293
BAU BAU!

36:57.333 --> 36:57.853
BAU BAU!

36:57.933 --> 36:58.694
Winnie, Winnie.

36:58.774 --> 37:02.297
Winnie, you're too cute.

37:02.317 --> 37:06.320
Look at Winnie's ears.

37:06.561 --> 37:09.603
My ears are cuter though.

37:13.964 --> 37:16.786
BAU BAU!

37:16.946 --> 37:18.427
Can we give Winnie a ranking?

37:18.447 --> 37:19.769
A ranking?

37:19.829 --> 37:20.349
A rating?

37:21.770 --> 37:22.311
Ranking.

37:22.731 --> 37:23.992
My brain is broken.

37:24.012 --> 37:25.273
That's Winnie.

37:25.293 --> 37:25.453
Winnie.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.394
Breaker of brains.

37:36.334 --> 37:36.734
That's it.

37:37.174 --> 37:39.435
BAU BAU!

37:39.455 --> 37:45.816
And let's take a look at the work we've been going over for you.

37:45.916 --> 37:49.377
Today's work is... De-den!

37:49.817 --> 37:51.137
Mococo Sky!

37:51.197 --> 37:53.598
A FUWAMOCO colored sky above the snow.

37:53.618 --> 37:54.598
A Mococo Sky!

37:54.618 --> 37:56.578
No more white about Mococo, right?

37:56.758 --> 37:59.219
Yeah, it's a Moco-chan sky.

37:59.599 --> 38:01.719
Well, I hope you got home safe.

38:01.859 --> 38:04.300
I'm gonna assume you got home safe since you uploaded this.

38:04.620 --> 38:04.781
Twitter.

38:04.801 --> 38:07.350
You don't want me to do that FUWMC.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.597
I don't think a ghost can upload to Twitter, huh?

38:10.748 --> 38:18.072
Well, I'm glad that, you know, you got to see a beautiful sky to calm you down after what I'm sure was a very busy day.

38:18.172 --> 38:18.633
Right.

38:19.393 --> 38:21.834
BAU BAU!

38:21.854 --> 38:29.239
And for our Question of the Day, we have de-den!

38:29.879 --> 38:31.300
Morning, FUWAMOCO!

38:31.380 --> 38:32.521
Morning!

38:32.581 --> 38:33.481
BAU BAU!

38:33.801 --> 38:36.843
This question was in my mind for almost a year now.

38:36.863 --> 38:39.905
How come, as demon guard dogs,

38:40.265 --> 38:43.686
You decided to protect our smiles instead of steal them.

38:43.706 --> 38:45.467
Aren't demons evil?

38:45.487 --> 38:50.969
And we unintentionally sold our souls for this.

38:50.989 --> 38:53.509
That's a very cute illustration.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.531
A very accurate one of FUWAMOCO.

38:56.931 --> 39:06.914
But to answer your question, you know, sometimes, and this isn't everyone, but sometimes people don't want their smiles protected.

39:06.994 --> 39:09.935
So, you know, we try to ask, you know, is it okay if we protect your smile?

39:09.955 --> 39:10.075
We try.

39:10.095 --> 39:10.736
Is it okay to boil your smile?

39:10.776 --> 39:10.916
We try.

We try.

39:33.625 --> 39:33.665
Is

39:34.265 --> 39:36.167
Whether you like it or not!

39:36.287 --> 39:38.929
We'll protect it, okay?

39:39.449 --> 39:40.630
Very demonic, right?

39:41.971 --> 39:44.873
Resistance is futile.

39:45.193 --> 39:46.514
FUWAMOCO!

39:46.574 --> 39:47.735

Got it.

39:52.799 --> 39:54.300
That's why.

39:55.501 --> 39:57.483
That's why these puppies are demon-grinded.

39:57.543 --> 39:58.183
Got it.

40:40.290 --> 40:42.311
One rock for me, one rock for you.

40:42.391 --> 40:44.373
I'm not gonna have to share the rock.

40:44.513 --> 40:47.275
Because we're versusing each other.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.037

40:50.077 --> 40:51.658

Who can push it the farthest.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.040

40:54.640 --> 40:56.101
That's what we're gonna be doing.

So Ruffians, we'll need you to kinda help us.

41:00.483 --> 41:02.524
Maybe let us know what to avoid.

41:02.784 --> 41:05.425
Let us know how to beat each other up.

41:05.565 --> 41:06.366

41:31.516 --> 41:36.718
And we're always interested in playing fun games because all games are fun to us!
