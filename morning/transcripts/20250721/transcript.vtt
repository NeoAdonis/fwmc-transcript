<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.493
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:38.137
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:41.341
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:44.585
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:47.668
BAU BAU!

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.811
Ruffians!

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:50.612
BAU BAU!

00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:56.440
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.931
Thank you for joining us today here for our 166th episode of BAU BAU!

00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:06.875
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:12.042
It's been a little while, but BAU BAU!

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:15.366
We're doing much better!

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:20.093
But, well, for Ruffians, maybe this is your first time joining us here for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:23.136
Ruffians joining us for the first time today!

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:29.863
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short, four-night morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:30.284 --> 00:06:31.245
A.K.A.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:31.625
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:34.669
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:41.276
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week!

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:43.498
So we can get a bit more balance!

00:06:44.778 --> 00:06:51.008
I'm here to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:52.931
Please take a note of the hashtag!

00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:56.196
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:56.597 --> 00:07:00.323
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:02.857
BAU BAU!

00:07:03.017 --> 00:07:05.059
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:17.011
There's been a lot happening, so we wanted to be able to, you know, share them with you, Ruffians, to be able to see you, to be able to start the week off on the right paw!

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:22.317
So, let's do that, okay?

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:22.497
BAU BAU!

00:07:23.018 --> 00:07:25.500
Well, Moco-chan.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.003
Do you have some of the things you want to share with the Ruffians?

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.007
Yeah, important information!

00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:33.548
Important information!

00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:37.433
Let's take a look, Moco-chan.

00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:49.206
Well... Ruffians... Do you need to say Pero in the comments, too?

00:07:50.627 --> 00:07:52.649
It's like you're summoning him or something.

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:55.993
Pero summoning!

00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:57.407
Ruffians.

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:03.193
Well, there has been another Pero sighting.

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:07.317
It's not because you're saying anything in the comments of the Ruffians!

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.784
Well, let's check it out, I guess.

00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:16.087
BAU BAU!

00:08:16.687 --> 00:08:17.368
Where is this?

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:18.889
Huh?

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.931
Good Pero.

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:24.175
He's just a big nasty pest Ruffians.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:30.116
But, uh, I guess you know your anime ex-boy.

00:08:30.357 --> 00:08:31.718
Ah, anime ex-boy!

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:35.363
Maybe you felt a little bit happy seeing a familiar face there.

00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:37.085
You know it's a big event.

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:39.187
Yeah, lots of people.

00:08:40.368 --> 00:08:43.472
Just Ruffians!

00:08:43.492 --> 00:08:43.813
Don't be a fool!

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:44.013
No, okay!

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:44.553
Don't give him anything!

00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:45.655
Don't even acknowledge him!

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:46.716
Yeah.

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:47.136
Got it!

00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:50.060
You know, you might have been asking for food.

00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:52.643
It's nicely done, but...

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:57.985
Ruffians, this is just the beginning, okay?

00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:03.115
He'll stop swiping it right from you, okay?

00:09:04.357 --> 00:09:06.982
You have to be careful, okay?

00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:08.645
You gave him your credit card!

00:09:10.368 --> 00:09:15.778
Well, that was your decision, Ruffians.

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.280
These situations, Ruffians, I think we've said many times.

00:09:21.502 --> 00:09:22.544
It's best just to ignore him.

00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:24.427
Don't give him any time of day, okay?

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:25.028
Told you!

00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:26.330
You should know by now!

00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:28.333
Yeah, got it.

00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:31.237
BAU BAU.

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:31.418
BAU BAU!

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:32.780
Don't fall for Pero's tricks, right?

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:34.122
Yeah.

00:09:34.142 --> 00:09:35.184
And yet this happens.

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:38.729
BAU BAU.

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:39.150
You'll be okay.

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:41.638
BAU BAU!

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:43.781
Just ignore him, okay?

00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:46.084
BAU BAU!

00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:48.447
Wow, Ruffians!

00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:55.236
I think maybe there's a few Ruffians here that are like, FUWAMOCO, it's been a little bit since I saw you last!

00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:56.338
Hi!

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:59.803
And that's because FUWAMOCO, we sleep.

00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:01.425
We are sick.

00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:09.871
FUWAMOCO We've been away for the past few days because we go really sick.

00:10:11.373 --> 00:10:16.538
FUWAMOCO But you know we've been taking it easy.

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.720
Getting lots and lots of sleep.

00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.505
FUWAMOCO And you know we made sure to go to the doctor too.

00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:29.691
FUWAMOCO And the doctor, she looked at us and said, FUWAMOCO Oh yeah, you're sick.

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:30.980
Yeah, that's all.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:39.312
We got some important medicines and then we've been stuck in a doghouse since.

00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:45.382
It's been rough though because Ruffians!

00:10:45.402 --> 00:10:47.725
We wanted to do so many things together with you!

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.708
And then now we have to stay put.

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:50.970
That's all.

00:10:52.115 --> 00:11:12.756
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:15.830
Pretty okay.

00:11:16.332 --> 00:11:23.674
I haven't been coughing really or anything, so not that much.

00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:26.826
But, let's take it easy!

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:32.372
And then you know, also get back to a number of things that we need to catch up on, you know?

00:11:33.073 --> 00:11:35.857
Especially, you know, there's been a bunch of summer fun going on!

00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:40.462
And my second anniversary is coming up too!

00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:42.665
So, lots and lots of stuff!

00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:43.846
I'm really excited!

00:11:45.808 --> 00:11:47.711
But thank you, Ruffians!

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:51.535
Thank you for all the help as we were recovering too, so...

00:11:51.515 --> 00:12:01.288
It made us feel much better knowing that you're thinking about us and we went alone, so... Thank you, Ruffians!

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:02.670
No, no, daijoubu, daijoubu!

00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:03.852
Chotto yowai dake!

00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:07.016
Mou chotto ne, yasumu kara ne.

00:12:07.157 --> 00:12:14.987
But there's lots of fun summer stuff coming up, so... Please look forward to it together with us, Ruffians!

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:17.691
BAU BAU!

00:12:18.397 --> 00:12:21.740
Well, you know, fun summer stuff kind of.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:26.025
I don't really know exactly what that is, but then... Did you hear, Ruffians?

00:12:28.087 --> 00:12:28.167
Huh?

00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:28.728
Maybe not.

00:12:29.108 --> 00:12:37.076
Well, hololive Summer is back this time as hololive Natsuperidon!

00:12:37.097 --> 00:12:37.177
Yes!

00:12:37.197 --> 00:12:37.357
BAU BAU!

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:38.518
BAU BAU!

00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:41.381
You know, there's a bunch of fun things going on right now.

00:12:42.702 --> 00:12:45.265
But to recap a little bit of what's happened

00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:46.306
So fun!

00:12:47.128 --> 00:12:47.248
Wow!

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:48.930
We are on the official channel!

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.554
Kicking off the start of the hololive to paradise!

00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:56.921
All together with Mari-senpai, Noel-senpai, Lappa-senpai, and Ori-senpai!

00:12:57.582 --> 00:12:57.702
Yeah!

00:12:57.722 --> 00:12:58.964
We had lots of fun!

00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:01.468
We played a bunch of games, you know.

00:13:01.988 --> 00:13:02.990
Watermelon.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.373
Coconut soccer.

00:13:05.413 --> 00:13:09.439
There's watermelons.

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:09.559
Yeah.

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:10.901
Watermelon.

00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:11.121
Right!

00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.783
The prizes, right?

00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:13.885
Right!

00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:16.343
I was looking forward to it.

00:13:16.383 --> 00:13:18.386
Plus, I was looking forward to it too.

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:23.953
And then... We went over prizes.

00:13:24.313 --> 00:13:27.858
We were excited because Moco-chan, you were on one team.

00:13:27.878 --> 00:13:29.600
And I was on the other team.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.165
So no matter what, we couldn't get prizes no matter what.

00:13:33.986 --> 00:13:35.488
We both made it lose each time.

00:13:35.508 --> 00:13:37.150
We get the prize!

00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:42.977
Maybe the prizes didn't make it to our paws.

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:44.775
Where are the prizes?

00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:47.408
I was looking forward to it.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.870
I pressed it, but I was like, it's okay, they'll definitely be the prizes.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:14:06.354
We had a bunch of fun together with them and then we're able to share some details about all the summer stuff happening!

00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:16.812
And you might have already seen too, but there's some special shorts going up on every member's channel and all these two of us have these two shorts!

00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:21.454
The whole nuts of peace!

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:22.779
We see we can do it now!

00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:26.093
Whole nuts of peace!

00:14:28.115 --> 00:14:31.159
Thank you!

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:31.339
Bye-bye!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.962
Please take a look if you haven't yet.

00:14:33.982 --> 00:14:36.085
If you have yet, please take a look too.

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:45.677
And also you know, I think the rest of the Advent, not just Nerissa, Nerissa will be waiting for you still.

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:49.482
There are also Biboo, Shiori.

00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:52.107
And there's a big calendar!

00:14:52.127 --> 00:14:55.533
There's gonna be new shorts going up every day!

00:14:55.553 --> 00:14:58.258
So please take a look at that, you know?

00:14:58.318 --> 00:15:05.732
Or maybe go check out your other favorite Yoshimen's channel to see if there's more shorts out yet!

00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:07.656
You're gonna search on FUWAMOCO channel, huh?

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:09.976
You're already here.

00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:11.197
You don't need to search it up.

00:15:11.217 --> 00:15:11.958
Right.

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:14.260
I'll just click select.

And you know, FUWAMOCO.

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.968
We also appeared in last week's hologram episode.

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.511
Celebrating the start to a new holo-natsu paradise!

00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:26.651
Right!

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:48.452

I don't know.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.863
Moco-chan, we haven't decided what we're gonna sing yet, right?

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:30.243
No.

00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:34.910
It's summer though, so we should probably sing some summery songs, right?

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:40.037
Ruffians, do you have any suggestions?

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.270
Ah!

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.041
See you soon!

00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:49.343

00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:05.178
It's good if you get a songbird.

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:08.000
A solo!

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.743
Is it gonna be a solo utawaku?

00:18:10.763 --> 00:18:11.763
Have to see!

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:12.684

00:18:13.445 --> 00:18:14.466
Who knows?

00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:16.808
We haven't really decided yet, have we?

00:18:16.788 --> 00:18:33.548

Yeah, so you can check that out.

00:18:57.472 --> 00:18:59.836
I think it's... I'm not too sure what channel it's on.

00:18:59.856 --> 00:19:02.260
Maybe the hololive official channel?

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.466
Why would anyone want to watch butt sumo?

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:09.973
I don't know why, but why?

00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:14.200
But we'll figure it out.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.803

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:54.379
And then afterwards...

00:19:55.102 --> 00:19:56.223

Another big part unveiling of Holonatsu this year is everybody has swimsuits!

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:22.909
And we kind of made quite a bit of a stir because fashion statement.

00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:29.959
I'm bathing so it's like de-den!

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:34.234
Fashion statement.

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:42.664
Reasonable if you crashed on an uninhabited island from a helicopter.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:45.887
These are bathing suits!

00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:47.890

See... You know, staffers are, they're like, huh... Advent, what about this?

00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:13.783
And we thought that was funny.

00:22:15.205 --> 00:22:18.570
We're like, okay, uh... I don't think we understood the scope of this.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.951
We didn't.

00:22:19.191 --> 00:22:19.812
We didn't.

00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:26.001
And now... It's maybe not as funny.

00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:29.169
It's where we are!

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.891
Just a prank!

00:22:31.051 --> 00:22:31.332

We're not criminals.

00:22:49.978 --> 00:22:50.479
Yeah.

00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:53.483
That's how we ended up here.

00:22:54.124 --> 00:22:56.287
You can't take your eyes off of us!

00:22:56.307 --> 00:22:56.427
We're-

00:22:56.828 --> 00:23:00.852
You're not supposed to see us, we're supposed to get away and, you know, do we steal your heart?

00:23:02.353 --> 00:23:03.274
BAU BAU!

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:09.219
But Pero!

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.823
Why Pero Ruffians?

00:23:15.885 --> 00:23:18.147
Pero is already wearing nothing normally.

00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:21.030
Moco-chan, you didn't need to point that out.

00:23:22.852 --> 00:23:23.873
Just saying!

00:23:23.893 --> 00:23:24.253
BAU BAU!

00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:33.219
I hope there's a lot of sunscreen otherwise, you know.

00:23:39.487 --> 00:23:39.687
Sunlight.

00:23:39.707 --> 00:23:39.867
BAU BAU!

00:23:40.428 --> 00:23:42.871
My turn won't do summer final camp!

00:23:43.272 --> 00:23:45.214
BAU BAU!

00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:51.222
I'm glad you like the FUWAMOCO fans.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.785
After all, you know.

00:23:54.001 --> 00:23:56.145
Our first bathing suits!

00:23:56.165 --> 00:24:04.000
Yeah, we've been looking forward to them for so long, so... BAU BAU!

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.767
And recently... Ruffians!

00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:12.857
We had some fun in Holo Earth together!

00:24:12.877 --> 00:24:12.977
Yeah!

00:24:12.998 --> 00:24:13.258
BAU BAU!

00:24:13.238 --> 00:24:24.270
We are really happy to be able to finally jump into hololive and, you know, met a place that all of our cover has been waiting on for a few years for a while now.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.798
It's a bit of a sandbox where we can join all together to come together and play and, you know, be able to spend time together.

00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:31.859
Yeah!

00:24:31.879 --> 00:24:35.663
So we are really happy to be able to try on a bunch of different clothes.

00:24:36.163 --> 00:24:37.986
Even some clothes that you made!

00:24:38.546 --> 00:24:39.347
And!

00:24:39.327 --> 00:24:43.091
Even make some codes ourselves too!

00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:45.414
BAU BAU!

00:24:45.434 --> 00:24:49.458
We have our first item as well if you'd like to, you know, try out FUWAMOCO coordinates.

00:24:49.478 --> 00:24:50.479
Yeah!

00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:54.604
I own BAU BAU sweater!

00:24:54.624 --> 00:24:54.724
Yeah!

00:24:54.744 --> 00:25:04.575
It was really fun doing not just trying on all the different outfits and trying this hairstyle, that hairstyle, but then there's also the survival mode.

00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:16.798
We really had a bunch of fun together with you Ruffians and we're looking forward to playing more!

00:25:16.818 --> 00:25:16.899
Huh?

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:18.181
The scooter?

00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:22.429
Baby, come race the Ruffians in the future, Moco-chan!

00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:32.747
But there's just so many things that we can do together in it and we're really looking forward to all the updates and the growth that there will be in the future too.

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:38.276
So we hope that you'll join us again in the future for more holo-earth Ruffians!

00:25:38.296 --> 00:25:41.481
BAU BAU!

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:44.783
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:45.224 --> 00:25:48.411
We have something exciting coming up too!

00:25:49.493 --> 00:25:49.874
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:49.894 --> 00:25:57.891
We're gonna be performing in Hong Kong for ACGHK coming up very soon!

00:25:57.911 --> 00:25:58.272
BAU BAU!

00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:03.102
You know what, the event is one of the biggest ones in Hong Kong!

00:26:03.122 --> 00:26:06.369
I've seen it a lot online and it looks like lots and lots of fun!

00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:12.622
It's gonna be happening on June 28th at 1.45pm at the main anime festival stage!

00:26:13.002 --> 00:26:19.095
We're gonna be doing a bit of a Q&A and then a mini Rock n' Rawr Party as well!

00:26:19.075 --> 00:26:24.763
So we're really looking forward to being able to spend some time with the Ruffians at FUWAMOCO!

00:26:24.843 --> 00:26:33.616
We're looking forward to seeing all the fun Advent stuff, cute cosplayers, and seeing you all there as well!

00:26:33.636 --> 00:26:39.004
We're really really excited!

00:26:39.204 --> 00:26:40.106
July 28th.

00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:40.526
July.

00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:41.067
July.

00:26:41.603 --> 00:26:45.070
Don't eat the past Ruffians!

00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:48.817
Although I can't believe that July is almost over too.

00:26:49.018 --> 00:26:49.980
Don't say it.

00:26:53.366 --> 00:26:56.192
But we are looking forward to the unofficial FUWAMOCO World Tour.

00:26:56.613 --> 00:26:58.056
It continues!

00:27:01.382 --> 00:27:01.823
BAU BAU!

00:27:03.524 --> 00:27:06.148
And there is also another big update!

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:10.476
hololive English, we're having our third concert coming up!

00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:11.878
All for one!

00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:14.743
And there's a big update!

00:27:14.763 --> 00:27:14.903
De-den!

00:27:16.145 --> 00:27:20.793
Look at the key mission!

00:27:20.813 --> 00:27:24.239
All of us, all together, all for one!

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.701
And you see...

00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:26.462
Justice.

00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:28.344
Justice!

00:27:28.364 --> 00:27:28.464
Yeah!

00:27:28.484 --> 00:27:30.266
They have their idol outfits.

00:27:30.286 --> 00:27:30.466
Right!

00:27:30.546 --> 00:27:33.029
And this time our outfits are a little bit different.

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:35.632
We're in the colorized outfits.

00:27:35.652 --> 00:27:36.413
But they're black.

00:27:37.895 --> 00:27:39.897
Everyone is wearing the black variant.

00:27:40.077 --> 00:27:47.005
And we all have a matching hair accessory too!

00:27:47.025 --> 00:27:47.345
The cute ribbon!

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:47.745
We're all FUWAMOCO!

00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:48.246
BAU BAU!

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:53.079
We're really really happy to be able to be here all together with everybody.

00:27:53.961 --> 00:27:57.932
But there's also some more updates too!

00:27:58.604 --> 00:28:04.355
Merchandise!

00:28:05.577 --> 00:28:07.621
It comes with a t-shirt!

00:28:08.081 --> 00:28:09.604
And then a lightstick!

00:28:09.624 --> 00:28:13.050
But there's also a very cool FUWAMOCO emblem too!

00:28:13.652 --> 00:28:17.118
You can actually put the sticker on the back of the lightstick too!

00:28:17.158 --> 00:28:19.903
I think you only get the sticker in the pack.

00:28:19.883 --> 00:28:24.471
Right, so you'll have to get your paws on a Ruffian.

00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:28.097
But it's nice to know being together with Moco-chan.

00:28:28.217 --> 00:28:36.230
Can you imagine if there's a Fuwawa one and then a Mococo one?

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:36.711
Fuwamoco.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.987
So, we hope that you'll get your paws on it so you'll be able to wear it at the concert.

00:28:43.007 --> 00:28:46.713
You know, use the lightstick at the concert too, Ruffians.

00:28:47.674 --> 00:28:51.399
And there's a lot more other merch as well so please check it out online at the kiosk.

00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:51.600
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:52.901
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:55.525
What a really exciting door!

00:28:56.987 --> 00:29:02.375
All for one, this song was revealed!

00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:03.837
It was revealed, Ruffians!

00:29:03.857 --> 00:29:03.937
Yes!

00:29:03.957 --> 00:29:04.538
Did you listen to it?

00:29:05.362 --> 00:29:06.743
Maybe it's been a bit hidden?

00:29:06.763 --> 00:29:10.207
The song is out!

00:29:10.227 --> 00:29:10.948
Yes, the song is out!

00:29:10.968 --> 00:29:12.349
Please go take a listen!

00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:13.310
The MV!

00:29:14.291 --> 00:29:16.633
Well, there's still maybe no MV yet.

00:29:17.074 --> 00:29:23.560
But the song is out so we really love it if you could listen to it lots and lots and get all prepared for the concert!

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.283
We're having a bunch of fun all together with us.

00:29:26.303 --> 00:29:28.185
We've been working so so hard!

00:29:28.205 --> 00:29:30.026
Lots of practice!

00:29:30.287 --> 00:29:33.630
So we hope that you'll get all pumped up and that

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.614
We'll have an amazing time at the end of August.

00:29:37.014 --> 00:29:40.979
Together all as one!

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:41.599
All for one!

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.422
It's so blizzard to it.

00:29:44.523 --> 00:29:44.723
Okay?

00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:47.426
BAU BAU!

00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.348
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:29:49.769 --> 00:29:50.710
August 23rd, 24th!

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:55.476
There's also streaming tickets to Ruffians if you can't make it to New York.

00:29:55.936 --> 00:30:00.461
So we hope that you'll be cheering for us there too.

00:30:00.482 --> 00:30:00.702
Okay?

00:30:00.722 --> 00:30:02.384
Two days!

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:03.465
BAU BAU!

00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:06.990
Thank you!

00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:07.951
Thank you!

00:30:09.813 --> 00:30:11.836
Wow, Moco-chan, you know what?

00:30:11.856 --> 00:30:15.220
It's been a little while since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:17.323
Ruffians!

00:30:17.984 --> 00:30:20.067
How does summer have you doing?

00:30:20.107 --> 00:30:21.028
What?

00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:22.530
How does summer have you doing?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:22.650
What?

00:30:26.936 --> 00:30:27.136
Exactly!

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:28.918
How does summer have you doing?

00:30:28.938 --> 00:30:30.280
Yeah!

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:33.483
Does that make sense?

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:41.975
It's very hot, that's an appropriate answer.

00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:43.997
Someone has me doing okay, thank you!

00:30:44.017 --> 00:30:46.360
You get it!

00:30:48.143 --> 00:30:49.925
Si!

00:30:49.945 --> 00:30:51.467
BAU BAU!

00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:52.689
Someone has me doing okay, I'm glad!

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.914
You haven't slept for more than 36 hours!

00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:57.055
Sleep!

00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:01.060
You'd be surprised what flow it has!

00:31:01.867 --> 00:31:09.922
It's winter.

00:31:11.284 --> 00:31:13.909
It's winter, it's winter, okay.

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:19.639
I don't know about that.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:41.557
I was only there for a moment.

00:31:42.177 --> 00:31:46.723
But it's okay now.

00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:47.403
Because you're here.

00:31:47.423 --> 00:31:47.684
Ruffians!

00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:50.227
I know it's that time again!

00:31:52.209 --> 00:31:52.309
What?

00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:54.639
I'm still recovering.

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:58.002
So it's time for a mini Pup Talk.

00:31:59.164 --> 00:32:02.166
I hear that here is safe for me.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:06.210
Mococo!

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.510
Ruffians!

00:32:07.632 --> 00:32:09.573
Do your best, okay?

00:32:09.593 --> 00:32:13.537
I know the days are hot and long, but you can do it!

00:32:14.318 --> 00:32:17.341
Just know, we're always cheering for you, okay?

00:32:18.282 --> 00:32:19.623
Ganbatte de!

00:32:19.983 --> 00:32:21.925
BAU BAU!

00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:28.779
Let's do our best to kill all the FUWAMOCOs!

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.680
Thank you!

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:38.908
Thank you for all the FUWAMOCOs!

00:32:38.928 --> 00:32:43.392
Let's take a look at some of the FUWAMOCOs!

00:32:43.412 --> 00:32:46.415
We'll start with the Doggie of the Day!

00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:49.498
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:53.090
Chispita!

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.253
BAU BAU!

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.495
So cute!

00:32:56.515 --> 00:32:56.615
Tiny!

00:32:56.635 --> 00:33:01.822
Look, the ears are big but everything else is so tiny!

00:33:01.842 --> 00:33:03.003
It's not even as big as a present, you!

00:33:04.645 --> 00:33:07.349
Everything is so tiny!

00:33:07.869 --> 00:33:09.371
Look, Chispita's ears.

00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:11.834
They're not so tiny.

00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:14.678
They're about as big as my ears here though.

00:33:15.739 --> 00:33:17.221
But everything else is so tiny.

00:33:17.782 --> 00:33:17.882
Yeah.

00:33:19.043 --> 00:33:22.046
BAU BAU!

00:33:23.928 --> 00:33:25.269
I don't even know what that is.

00:33:25.329 --> 00:33:28.412
It's a pet shish pita with maybe three fingers.

00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:30.694
Three fingers, maybe two.

00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:32.616
A full hand is a little bit scary.

00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:35.179
Maybe it's like the pinky pet.

00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:38.021
Yeah, this is a small dog.

00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:39.383
It is a small dog.

00:33:39.483 --> 00:33:40.444
It's shish pita!

00:33:43.847 --> 00:33:47.110
How does shish pita BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

00:33:59.425 --> 00:34:05.031
Oh, it's so tiny, I can almost not hear it.

00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:06.393
That's how it sounds.

00:34:06.813 --> 00:34:07.554
So tiny.

00:34:07.594 --> 00:34:19.307
Cheese Pita is so tiny, I was thinking we're almost friends to go, so I smiled, but there's no FUWAMOCO friends to go.

00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:23.712
This is Cheese Pita friends to go.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:30.949
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:34:34.294 --> 00:34:46.392
Have a howl of a day!

00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:48.991
Maybe selfish.

00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:56.020
I hope that she's picked up a pickaxe as her OC too!

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.221
BAU BAU!

00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.424
Thank you!

00:34:58.444 --> 00:34:58.604
BAU BAU!

00:35:00.206 --> 00:35:02.790
Next we have a regular corner.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.292
Today I went on a walk.

00:35:05.153 --> 00:35:07.736
And we have De-den!

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.002
That's so crazy!

00:35:12.022 --> 00:35:14.105
Oh my gosh.

00:35:14.766 --> 00:35:15.467
Temple ruins.

00:35:16.122 --> 00:35:17.325
Beautiful!

00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:21.213
It looks like it's almost out of a video game!

00:35:22.776 --> 00:35:22.876
Yeah!

00:35:23.177 --> 00:35:29.029
My show was unforgettable, you know, being able to see up close in person!

00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:31.374
Yeah!

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:31.475
Wow!

00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:32.958
And look at the clouds too!

00:35:33.058 --> 00:35:34.702
Everything's just beautiful!

00:35:35.143 --> 00:35:36.325
Wonderful weather!

And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:58.910
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:01.113
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:36:01.133 --> 00:36:01.254
Hello!

00:36:01.454 --> 00:36:02.516
I have a question.

00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:07.424
What do you think about Ruffians from all around the world interacting with each other?

00:36:08.004 --> 00:36:13.133
How do you feel knowing that people from different countries and languages are connecting because of you?

00:36:13.153 --> 00:36:16.538
Um... It makes us feel...

00:36:16.518 --> 00:36:23.411
Very very very happy!

00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:23.872
Really happy Ruffians!

00:36:23.892 --> 00:36:27.859
You know, we really really love Ruffians from all over the world!

00:36:27.879 --> 00:36:29.141
Maybe come, you know, close?

00:36:29.242 --> 00:36:30.203
Connect, you know?

00:36:30.223 --> 00:36:31.466
Connect, you know?

00:36:31.486 --> 00:36:34.792
You know, maybe practice languages together, you know?

00:36:34.812 --> 00:36:36.094
Like, I'm learning Japanese, you know?

00:36:36.114 --> 00:36:36.535
I'm learning English.

00:36:36.515 --> 00:36:39.359
BAU BAU is in Spanish!

00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:45.367
Ruffians are all over the world!

00:36:45.407 --> 00:36:55.401
So it makes us really happy when we're able to go to places like Hong Kong and be able to meet a bunch of different Ruffians from all over the place!

00:36:55.381 --> 00:37:07.456
We hope that you'll be able to go and visit other places too and hopefully be able to meet lots of different Ruffians as well.

00:37:07.516 --> 00:37:11.301
Thank you Ruffians!

00:37:11.381 --> 00:37:19.110
It really warms our hearts seeing you be able to just have fun interacting together on Twitter too.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.975
So you wanna bubble a real life one day too?

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:26.375
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:26.395 --> 00:37:29.519
