WEBVTT

00:05:04.473 --> 00:05:08.363
BAU BAU!

00:05:09.827 --> 00:05:12.494
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:15.462
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:21.539
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.663
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.606
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:29.207
BAU BAU!

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:33.732
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:35.514
Ruffians!

00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.257
We missed you!

00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:43.523
Today is our 150th episode!

00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:44.824
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.060
BAU BAU!

00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:50.484
Bobo!

00:05:50.504 --> 00:05:50.604
Bobo!

00:05:50.624 --> 00:05:52.050
We did it!

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.551
We did it!

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:53.615
We did it!

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:54.398
Yeah!

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.603
Big 150!

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:55.944
Thank you!

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.550
Confetti again!

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.751
Confetti!

00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.397
Confetti!

00:05:59.417 --> 00:05:59.638
Confetti!

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:00.682
Confetti, please!

00:06:00.642 --> 00:06:00.822
We did it

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:08.802
You made it!

00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:09.543
Yeah!

00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:09.724
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:09.904
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:11.006
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:11.507
Thank you!

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:16.136
I can't believe, you know, it's been 150 mornings together with you, but they've all been different.

00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:18.140
Oh, that's super silly!

00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:20.745
It's not a good thing!

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.550
It's a good thing, right, Ruffians?

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.632
They've all been different.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:28.791
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:32.478
Bye bye!

00:06:32.898 --> 00:06:34.962
You missed us!

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:35.984
We missed you FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.988
Wait, I have a question.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.650
A question?

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.539
Why are you always in front of me?

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.623
What kind of bottle is shoulders now?

00:06:46.643 --> 00:06:50.029
I think this is a nose.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.137
Well, I'll just let you two go again.

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:54.560
Ruffians!

00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:55.502
Which one was it?

00:06:57.687 --> 00:06:57.767
Huh?

00:06:57.787 --> 00:06:57.867
Huh?

00:06:57.887 --> 00:07:00.512
I don't remember.

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:00.653
Yes.

00:07:01.414 --> 00:07:02.576
I don't know.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.400
Uh-oh.

00:07:05.823 --> 00:07:06.364
Maybe it's this way.

00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:10.258
BAU BAU!

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.247
I can't remember, it's only been 150 episodes.

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:24.204
FUWAMOCO is joining us for the very first time today for a very special 150th episode.

00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:30.816
To explain a little bit about what FUWAMOCO Morning is, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show.

00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:33.359
Help every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.621
A.K.A.

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:35.341
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:38.525
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:44.192
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:50.600
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.764
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:57.848
BAU BAU!

00:07:57.868 --> 00:07:58.609
150 times!

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:00.611
One hundred and fifty!

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:04.696
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:07.059
I have too many more to choose!

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:09.082
BAU BAU!

00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:10.603
Well, it's a new week.

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:13.147
It's episode 150.

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:17.492
I'm going to try to make it snappy.

00:08:17.512 --> 00:08:18.493
Snappy?

00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:18.893
What?

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:25.221
Because FUWAMOCO Morning is supposed to be a short format morning show, right?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.706
That means 150 minutes there, right Moco-chan?

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:33.611
That's what it means, right Ruffians?

00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:35.954
Short.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:41.242
Wow, Moco-chan, you know Mondays are a little rough sometimes.

00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.264
They're a little bit nasty, right?

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:50.014
Are you feeling Monday blues?

00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:50.314
Yeah.

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:57.113
You know, usually in the very beginning something nasty happens.

00:08:57.754 --> 00:08:59.557
There's a Pero sliding.

00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:08.109
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are feeling a little bit sensitive towards things that are nasty like Pero today.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:09.451
A bit sad.

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:10.412
Yeah.

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:16.354
That's okay, so you can just, you know, maybe make things quiet for the first five minutes.

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:17.496
Okay.

00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:21.122
It's okay, today's a special day.

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:23.265
I'm ready for the Pero Sighting.

00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:28.774
There has been a Pero Sighting.

00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:29.876
I didn't mean to say it, Moco-chan.

00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:29.996
Okay.

00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:30.396
Pero is not nasty!

00:09:30.857 --> 00:09:35.645
Well, wait until you see the Pero Sighting.

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:36.907
Let's take a look, Moco-chan.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.150
Okay.

00:09:41.594 --> 00:09:45.259
De-den!

00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.745
Who's knocking on Monday's door, huh?

00:09:51.587 --> 00:09:51.687
Pero.

00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:56.654
But Ruffians, even if Pero's nasty, we don't go back to bed.

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:57.455
No.

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:01.421
Yeah, we have to face the nasty things head on sometimes, right?

00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:02.162
Let him in?

00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:03.844
Huh?

00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:05.526
Do you see how he's a brave?

00:10:06.227 --> 00:10:08.310
He seems super trustworthy.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.032
I don't know either.

00:10:10.012 --> 00:10:12.235
Nice gift.

00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:15.238
I think if we open the door, we need to make sure we're ready.

00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:16.580
Right.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.621
Preparation.

00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:18.322
Yeah.

00:10:18.342 --> 00:10:19.102
Safety.

00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:21.906
Maybe something like pudding.

00:10:21.926 --> 00:10:22.607
Preparation.

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:23.508
Cat.

00:10:23.528 --> 00:10:26.891
Or maybe... Scissors?

00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:27.332
Scissors?

00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:28.053
Scissors?

00:10:28.073 --> 00:10:28.593
A rock.

00:10:28.954 --> 00:10:30.135
A rock would be good.

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:31.116
She doesn't have paper.

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:32.918
She has a knife.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.281
Rock beats knife.

00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:38.345
Yes.

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:38.685
What?

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.792
Yo!

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:44.526
Is this trying to cut a cake?

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:47.596
Is it your birthday, Ruffians?

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:51.027
Maybe it's your brain cake.

00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:51.207
Ha!

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.434
Well, uh...

00:10:54.224 --> 00:11:07.717
If you don't have anything like a rock or anything, um, at least, you know, uh, when there's something nasty, I feel like a warm drink, like some tea, like a nice cup of tea might be helpful.

00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:09.759
So, maybe.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.421
That's my recommendation.

00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:13.822
A cup of tea.

00:11:14.843 --> 00:11:18.507
Make everything nasty a little bit better.

00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:20.128
Moco-chan, forget about this.

00:11:20.148 --> 00:11:21.970
Throw the tea on him, okay?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:36.245
There was some news recently, Ruffians.

00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:40.954
It's been a little bit rougher news.

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:52.044
But the other day, our very beloved Shio-senpai of hololive's second gen, beloved Kusogaki Witch, she graduated.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:57.169
And of course you know she had a beautiful 3D graduation live.

00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:01.312
And it was joined by many friends for some final performances as well.

00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:05.256
Also, Chloe-senpai graduated!

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:09.760
In case you didn't know, Chloe-senpai ended her streaming activities earlier this year.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:18.670
It was a surprise sequel there, but also you know, nice to be able to see Shion-senpai and Chloe-senpai together again.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.075
But it ended very beautifully with some emotional performances!

00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:27.560
You know, our favorite major bias, Shion-senpai's original song.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:34.127
And then lastly, her final original song that she just released, Shion.

00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:39.204
That was really touching.

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:41.551
And you know, it's hard to say goodbye.

00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:47.509
But we're excited for all the amazing things waiting for him in the future!

00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:56.056
You know, FUWAMOCO, we only had a few moments together with Shion-senpai, but they were all really special.

00:12:56.096 --> 00:13:04.470
And you know, we are so happy recently because we finally were able to talk a little bit more, you know, during the hanami we did together.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.313
All thanks to Suisei-senpai.

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.598
We're happy to end it off like that too.

00:13:09.578 --> 00:13:16.048
Thank you so much Shion-senpai for your 7 years!

00:13:16.068 --> 00:13:16.288
7 years!

00:13:16.308 --> 00:13:17.290
Thank you.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.776
Amazing.

00:13:21.796 --> 00:13:23.559
BAU BAU!

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:36.058
It's more rough news but just yesterday we said goodbye to Mumei-senpai hololive English -Promise-.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.895
She also had a very beautiful 3D graduation live.

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:43.857
But that's not it!

00:13:43.877 --> 00:13:49.223
You know she left us some very wonderful presents beforehand.

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:51.365
Did you see it?

00:13:51.846 --> 00:13:53.948
All the cover songs she released!

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:59.674
She released a cover song of Don't Wanna Hold together with Kronii-senpai on Kronii-senpai's channel!

00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:00.615
Have you listened to it?

00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:01.676
It was so cool.

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:03.377
Well you have another song to listen to.

00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:04.619
And!

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.860
Thank you.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:13.088
She also released a cover of Tottomae together with Korone-senpai and Mumei-senpai!

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:14.009
Yes, I know!

00:14:14.029 --> 00:14:19.796
I wanted to try to say Korone-senpai and Korone-senpai at the same time!

00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:20.356
Hi!

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:24.581
What does it become?

00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:26.163
Korone.

00:14:26.183 --> 00:14:27.464
Yes!

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:29.907
And!

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:37.678
Mumei-senpai also released a cover of Best Friend together with Bei-senpai on Bei-senpai's channel.

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:40.142
It's really really good.

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:42.325
Amazing cover.

00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:49.094
And then she also released a cover of Gravity on her own channel.

00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:52.619
Gravity is a really really special song to us too.

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:55.303
A song that we have listened for a long time.

00:14:56.144 --> 00:15:05.674
I saw it meant so much to us and I'm sure Ruffians that there's so much emotion packed in it.

00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:05.794
Yeah.

00:15:05.814 --> 00:15:11.601
Mumei-senpai left behind a lot of songs, a lot of songs!

00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:12.321
What's that for then?

00:15:12.342 --> 00:15:12.882
Because there's a thousand!

00:15:12.902 --> 00:15:13.663
Another, another comment!

00:15:13.723 --> 00:15:18.869
The last song that she left us a very special Tadakoi Hitotsu.

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:19.689
That's also Mumei-senpai's channel.

00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:20.731
The last one on her channel.

00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:24.835
But apparently, she mentioned that she has more?

00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:28.060
Wow, coming out!

00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:29.142
I don't know.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:32.247
I don't know, but you know... That's amazing.

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:44.305
Mumei-senpai left us so many wonderful memories, so many amazing songs and works, so we're really happy to have even more to be able to treasure to you.

00:15:44.325 --> 00:15:45.708
And congratulations!

00:15:45.728 --> 00:15:46.048
Congratulations!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:52.999
You know, we all sang together, we were able to sing Mumei-senpai's very special original song,

00:15:52.979 --> 00:16:20.202
You know, we feel like maybe we weren't able to, but...

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:28.589
More than anything, we just want to be able to... You know, treasure those good memories that we had.

00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:31.616
We didn't want to make them more sad.

00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:39.093
You know, the last time we talked together... We didn't get to talk about the things we wanted to talk about!

00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:40.215
You know, so...

00:16:40.988 --> 00:16:44.334
But I'm sure you know we're not the only ones that feel that way.

00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:45.416
That's all.

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:49.322
But more than anything, let's remember the good times!

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:49.863
I know!

00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:52.828
All the silly things we did together!

00:16:52.848 --> 00:16:55.473
Overwatch!

00:16:55.493 --> 00:17:02.425
And you know we're really looking forward to playing more Overwatch together!

00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:02.625
FUWAMOCO.

00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:08.003
And you know seeing FUWAMOCO play was here in Japan as well.

00:17:08.384 --> 00:17:12.228
We had to take her to it once.

00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:16.633
She has to learn.

00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:19.476
It was a lot of fun.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:23.820
Thank you FUWAMOCO for everything!

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.123
We'll always, always remember everything you've given to us.

00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:33.090
Thank you for being a sweet girl.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.270
BAU BAU!

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:37.675
Wow, there's a lot of news, a lot of things going on.

00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:41.663
But, there was also another 3D live that happened.

00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:47.895
Kiara-senpai, she had a 3D concert, a spring concert.

00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:53.807
And FUWAMOCO and a bunch of EF members were all there, just the two of us.

00:17:54.344 --> 00:18:00.013
We were there!

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:00.754
We were so happy.

00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:03.157
It was a very special idol live.

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:05.201
It was all Hello Project.

00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:06.963
Hello Project is an idol agency.

00:18:06.983 --> 00:18:08.526
Hello Project songs.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.911
And we got to perform Amanojaku from Smilage.

00:18:12.251 --> 00:18:14.054
It's been stuck in my head forever.

00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:14.735
Right!

00:18:15.076 --> 00:18:18.020
And also Rival, a song by Berryz Kobo.

00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.402
And it was so much fun.

00:18:19.422 --> 00:18:22.647
Especially Rival together with everybody.

00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:25.132
But you know, I saw Kiara-senpai.

00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:30.141
She was really happy to be able to do all these songs she loves together with everybody!

00:18:30.161 --> 00:18:31.083
But us too!

00:18:31.524 --> 00:18:36.173
You don't see everybody performing these hello pro songs!

00:18:36.193 --> 00:18:37.154
It was really great!

00:18:37.174 --> 00:18:38.577
It's a strange feeling, huh?

00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:55.198
Hiyara-senpai too!

00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:57.201
Right!

00:18:57.221 --> 00:19:01.006
Y'all always have fun!

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.348
Fun, fun, fun!

00:19:02.368 --> 00:19:05.953
But Kiyara-senpai also unveiled a brand new original song!

00:19:06.574 --> 00:19:07.475
Perfume!

00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:08.937
Perfume!

00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:09.638
Look at her here!

00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:13.423
So beautiful.

00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:18.590
But it's a super stylish and poppy song and it's a definite check out, okay?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.574
Especially the music video here!

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:28.039
Daura-senpai is so pretty but... Daura-senpai?

00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:31.986
Daura-senpai!

00:19:32.447 --> 00:19:35.032
Daura not-senpai!

00:19:35.493 --> 00:19:39.480
Also designed a bathing suit for her!

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.101
So please check it out!

00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:43.087
That means it's a bathing suit scene.

00:19:43.107 --> 00:19:44.710
Not Daura-senpai.

00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:53.415
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:05.398
Have a howl of a day!

00:20:05.378 --> 00:20:08.662
There's been a lot going on!

00:20:09.023 --> 00:20:19.195
Recently in exciting Advent news, well, there's something going on in Shibuya!

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:19.736
BAU BAU!

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:20.717
At Shibuya Tsutaya!

00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:26.745
At Shibuya Tsutaya's IP bookstore, together with Design Coco, they started a new brand,

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.907
Good!

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:28.027
What?

00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:30.390
Just to celebrate, you know, two anniversaries.

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:35.137
Anniversary Shibuya Tsutaya reopening and IP Bookstores reopening.

00:20:35.297 --> 00:20:35.478
Oh!

00:20:36.199 --> 00:20:36.299
Yeah!

00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:38.182
That's why it's special.

00:20:38.502 --> 00:20:42.608
Yeah, and Advent, you know, we're there to celebrate!

00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:42.728
Yeah!

00:20:42.748 --> 00:20:49.498
Look at us here in our Zeo Gravity Battle Suit.

00:20:49.518 --> 00:20:52.322
Make a list of it, Advent!

00:20:52.342 --> 00:20:52.622
Are you ready?

00:20:52.643 --> 00:20:52.743
Yeah!

00:20:52.763 --> 00:20:53.003
Oh, BAU BAU!

00:20:52.983 --> 00:20:54.846
Mama!

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:55.607
But you know what?

00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:59.933
Just us advent pop-up shop with super cool outfits.

00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:02.898
And there's a bunch of, you know, different words.

00:21:02.918 --> 00:21:07.905
But I... But Moco-chan, what... Huh?

00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:11.531
Well... Why is cheese the eye?

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:14.014
FUWAMOCO figures will be on display.

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:15.797
But!

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.180
But!

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.285
They sorta... Didn't say what size the figures are.

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:27.696
Life size!

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.900
Life size!

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.881
If you need it!

00:21:31.562 --> 00:21:33.706
Look at the morphins!

00:21:34.447 --> 00:21:35.188
What's that?

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.190
What's that?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.173
Oh my gosh!

00:21:38.554 --> 00:21:41.278
Can you believe it?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.824
Oh my gosh!

00:21:45.093 --> 00:21:49.960
Their life size is one life scale.

00:21:51.502 --> 00:21:54.206
Lots and lots and lots of them.

00:21:54.467 --> 00:22:02.899
But right now, the most important thing, they are on, not the life size, but they are on priority right now.

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:07.329
Yo, you can take a home!

00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:07.769
1-7-Skimmo.

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:09.111
1-1-2-Bad.

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:12.597
But they're on pre-order right now, you can get them.

00:22:12.697 --> 00:22:14.259
Also on AmiAmi!

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:14.460
Yes!

00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:17.084
I think there was some confusion.

00:22:17.104 --> 00:22:19.468
We're gonna talk about it more later because we don't have much time.

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:22.873
But, so, there is a deluxe version.

00:22:22.893 --> 00:22:24.435
And it's more individual.

00:22:24.455 --> 00:22:27.520
They are set to get set.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.043
So, it may be a bit pricey.

00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:32.548
But there is a non-deluxe version!

00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:40.159
And it's not a set, so maybe that's a bit easier.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.643
You know FUWAMOCO are kind of a set, right?

00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:44.306
Kind of a pair, right?

00:22:45.568 --> 00:22:48.152
But sometimes the world doesn't accept pairs too.

00:22:50.976 --> 00:22:51.316
It's pre-ordered!

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:52.478
The pre-orders are open!

00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:54.160
It's made to order.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.883
It's made to order, you know.

00:22:55.903 --> 00:23:02.173
So, Ruffians, sometimes, at FUWAMOCO, sometimes, they're like, oh well, maybe, you know, after it comes up, then I'll get my paws on it.

00:23:03.154 --> 00:23:04.957
It's made to order.

00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:15.514
You know, the chances that you'll be able to find it, that means that a Ruffian had to be like, I don't really know about this figure anymore, and then decided to say goodbye to it.

00:23:15.534 --> 00:23:15.634
Yeah.

00:23:16.355 --> 00:23:19.039
I don't know if that's gonna happen that much.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:39.458
Don't regret things like FUWAMOCO has before, okay?

00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:41.001
BAU BAU!

00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.423
By the way, there is a giveaway!

00:23:42.644 --> 00:23:44.046
There's a giveaway, Ruffians!

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.130
If you go and retweet it again.

00:23:46.571 --> 00:23:46.651
Yes!

00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:57.130
But, if you go over to Twitter and you follow and follow the AskRin account, not just FUWAMOCO, although that makes us happy, but follow the AskRin account and repost the retweet.

00:23:57.671 --> 00:24:03.522
If you follow and retweet them, then you could be entered to win the video.

00:24:03.502 --> 00:24:05.064
Not the one-one scale.

00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:05.905
Not the one-one.

00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:06.726
This song would be nice.

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:10.331
We'll talk about it way later, okay?

00:24:10.351 --> 00:24:10.992
BAU BAU!

00:24:11.012 --> 00:24:12.654
We still have a lot to say!

00:24:14.176 --> 00:24:14.636
BAU BAU!

00:24:15.077 --> 00:24:23.087
Also, just the other day, we were in Osaka for Japan Expo!

00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:23.368
BAU BAU!

00:24:23.388 --> 00:24:27.793
We're at the big Osaka Expo that's happening right now in Japan!

00:24:28.074 --> 00:24:28.194
Right!

00:24:28.214 --> 00:24:29.155
Have you heard of it?

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:34.826
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:34.846 --> 00:24:37.611
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:37.832 --> 00:24:44.865
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:44.845 --> 00:24:49.794
And you know, it was our first time performing on an outdoor stage.

00:24:49.814 --> 00:24:51.177
It was beautiful.

00:24:51.277 --> 00:24:54.984
Everyone lit up the night sky with their palm lights.

00:24:55.004 --> 00:24:56.767
The weather was nice too.

00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.230
We were super touched.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.015
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:25:00.995 --> 00:25:13.496
But it was really nice to be able to see so many fans hololistic of all ages unite and be able to see and hear the support for everybody together.

00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:21.349
FUWAMOFRIENDS we definitely heard your cheers, your BAU BAU's, and the FUWAMOCODES too!

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.145
Thank you!

00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:25.226
Thank you for letting us be happy!

00:25:25.287 --> 00:25:26.669
We'll be happy!

00:25:26.969 --> 00:25:27.951
Thank you!

00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:32.118
But it was a huge honor for us to perform at such a big event!

00:25:32.138 --> 00:25:38.368
Yeah, with so many people that, you know, still aren't familiar with hololive or VTubers!

00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:38.749
I know!

00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:39.791
Very exciting!

00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:45.881
We hope we can perform at more performances like that and reach even more people in the future too!

00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:46.001
Yeah!

00:25:46.017 --> 00:25:49.501
BAU BAU!

00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:52.584
Yeah, it's a big international event.

00:25:52.604 --> 00:25:53.986
It really is!

00:25:55.568 --> 00:25:58.231
We are so happy!

00:25:58.251 --> 00:25:59.332
We weren't happy.

00:26:02.295 --> 00:26:03.416
Ruffians.

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:12.126
I know it's been a little while, but... Ruffians, there's been a misunderstanding.

00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:17.340
Actually, a lot of misunderstandings.

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:23.573
So, you know, we have to clear them up.

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:34.215
And, you know, so to be able to clear them up, we went the rest of the year and we asked them for their misunderstandings.

00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:45.934
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:45.954 --> 00:26:50.241
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:55.650
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:01.519
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:03.682
Here we go!

00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:05.144
BAU BAU!

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.291
Hello.

00:27:11.132 --> 00:27:14.236
My name is Shiori Novella, hololive's archiver.

00:27:14.596 --> 00:27:18.361
And I would like to clear up a little misunderstanding.

00:27:20.003 --> 00:27:26.412
You see, when people look at me they think, oh, she likes blonde anime boys.

00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:30.477
But the reality is a lot more complicated than that.

00:27:30.794 --> 00:27:34.581
Now if you look at this, I prepared a little simple slideshow.

00:27:35.724 --> 00:27:40.253
This is Dimitri's gradient from Fire Emblem Three Houses.

00:27:41.114 --> 00:27:41.876
Does it look blonde?

00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:42.357
Yeah!

00:27:42.818 --> 00:27:46.805
But you know, it's not just because he's blonde that I like him.

00:27:47.387 --> 00:27:48.629
It's about the personality.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.655
Because as you can see, if we move on...

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.014
Gilbert from Unicorn Overlord?

00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:56.121
This pale color here?

00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.596
Yeah sure, you can classify it as a type of blonde.

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:04.108
But what about this character?

00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:06.324
Aramis, or Aramis.

00:28:07.065 --> 00:28:09.267
He is also blonde, but you know what?

00:28:09.447 --> 00:28:11.089
I didn't like that.

00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:11.930
He was okay, sure.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:17.536
But I didn't think that he was as interesting as Gilbert over here.

00:28:17.576 --> 00:28:24.683
Or what about even Dimitri, who has a higher contrast and blondification.

00:28:24.743 --> 00:28:29.208
So if you look at these, blonde, but not interesting.

00:28:29.849 --> 00:28:31.851
So being blonde isn't everything.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.692
Now what about here, Ryo?

00:28:34.453 --> 00:28:35.654
Yeah, sure!

00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:37.076
Also looks a little blonde.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.739
Could be even whitish like freaking Kaneki Ken.

00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:48.590
But as cute as Ryo is, he's also a little... Well, I think spoilers might be okay.

00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:50.332
But I think he's a little bit of a deviant.

00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:59.003
A little bit of a devil, so... Blonde, cute, and really attractive and dang!

00:28:58.983 --> 00:29:00.525
But not, not good.

00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:01.746
Not good for the heart.

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:07.774
Now, if you keep moving on the list, you'll see a lot more variety in the fictional men that I did like.

00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:09.937
Well, Mart Lewis from Code Vein.

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:12.300
He's nowhere close to blonde.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.685
Funnily enough, he has the same Japanese voice actor as Dimitri from Fire Emblem.

00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:17.807
But you see this?

00:29:17.847 --> 00:29:19.148
Not blonde at all.

00:29:19.929 --> 00:29:23.214
So, at the end of the day, it is about personality.

00:29:23.854 --> 00:29:25.176
As you can see.

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:25.999
Next person.

00:29:26.079 --> 00:29:26.440
Stroll.

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:27.324
Looks blonde.

00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:28.648
I don't know him though.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.682
The moment I look at him, I don't think like, um, fine, no.

00:29:33.043 --> 00:29:36.415
I just think, hmm, not my type.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.366
But the other guys speak too and he's pretty blonde, but I think that is a coincidence.

00:29:41.047 --> 00:29:44.212
And the last one, nowhere close to blonde.

00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:45.113
Completely blue.

00:29:46.115 --> 00:30:04.444
So, and by defense, and to clear the misunderstanding, it's not just about being blonde, it's about what's inside.

00:30:07.327 --> 00:30:09.430
BAU BAU!

00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:13.775
I didn't think I was going to understand the misunderstanding, but I understand.

00:30:13.795 --> 00:30:15.518
There's no misunderstanding.

00:30:15.538 --> 00:30:17.000
You get it, Ruffians?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.380
Yeah.

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:22.367
But, uh, I thought, it's not just that they're blonde.

00:30:22.927 --> 00:30:27.293
She likes the blonde personality.

00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:37.194
What I took away from this is that maybe we're going to have to look for a lot more different genres when we go and look for doujinshi for Shiori.

00:30:37.274 --> 00:30:39.015
That's what I thought.

00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:41.578
There's more work to be done.

00:30:41.638 --> 00:30:48.545
Yeah, it was quite enough explaining exactly what she wanted to the employee when I don't know what it is.

00:30:50.246 --> 00:30:53.249
Because the employee, she kept on being like, which game is it?

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:55.652
This game or this game or this game is this character?

00:30:55.712 --> 00:30:56.993
And I was like...

00:30:58.238 --> 00:30:58.979
I don't know anymore.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.522
We're gonna have to do some studying.

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:02.883
Yeah, we'll have to study.

00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:04.625
No misunderstanding.

00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:06.047
That's not the point.

00:31:06.547 --> 00:31:07.468
Understood now.

00:31:07.748 --> 00:31:08.449
I understand.

00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.750
Yeah.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.272
OPA!

00:31:12.073 --> 00:31:12.314
OPA!

00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:13.955
Okay, misunderstanding.

00:31:14.236 --> 00:31:15.077
Understood.

00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:15.877
Understood.

00:31:16.158 --> 00:31:20.102
Okay, there's more misunderstanding.

00:31:20.122 --> 00:31:20.242
Yeah.

00:31:20.362 --> 00:31:21.844
Let's go and find some good Ruffians!

00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:24.567
OPA!

00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.794
Hello!

00:31:29.815 --> 00:31:30.115
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:30.495 --> 00:31:33.159
It's me, Cecilia McGrimm from hololive Yen Justice.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.342
Speaking to win!

00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:41.711
Congratulations first of all for 150 episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:42.352 --> 00:31:50.083
It's really cool that you reached this gigantic milestone and I hope you always have fun with it and you keep having fun with it.

00:31:50.103 --> 00:31:56.292
Today I am here to clear up a misunderstanding actually.

00:31:56.272 --> 00:32:05.145
So, my misunderstanding is that some of my audience have misunderstood that they think that I'm evil.

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:07.569
But, I'm not evil.

00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:11.334
And you know this, of course.

00:32:11.354 --> 00:32:12.315
You know that I'm not evil.

00:32:12.496 --> 00:32:18.284
And yeah, sometimes they say stuff like, uh, is it true that shouldn't justice be evil?

00:32:18.364 --> 00:32:19.266
Isn't Advent good?

00:32:19.466 --> 00:32:20.187
But no.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.943
No, that's completely false.

00:32:22.963 --> 00:32:25.927
And yeah, please explain to everyone that it's false.

00:32:26.307 --> 00:32:27.989
Tell them that it's false.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.312
Because I'm really good.

00:32:30.332 --> 00:32:32.135
And I'm a really good automaton.

00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:34.077
And I've never done an evil deed in my life.

00:32:34.318 --> 00:32:35.439
And I've never hated anything.

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:37.702
And I've never done a crime.

00:32:37.742 --> 00:32:39.044
And I've never committed murder.

00:32:39.665 --> 00:32:40.145
Allegedly.

00:32:40.185 --> 00:32:45.793
And yeah, so please clear up this misunderstanding for me.

00:32:46.073 --> 00:32:46.354
Okay.

00:32:46.874 --> 00:32:48.216
Thank you!

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.199
Bye bye!

00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:50.985
BAU BAU!

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:52.590
Bye!

00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:56.704
Congratulations again!

00:32:59.688 --> 00:33:01.711
BAU BAU!

00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:06.157
She wants us to clear up that she's not evil, but... Huh?

00:33:06.177 --> 00:33:06.257
Huh?

00:33:06.277 --> 00:33:07.959
This... Is this how misunderstandings work?

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:09.121
We didn't have any evidence.

00:33:10.282 --> 00:33:10.442
Huh?

00:33:10.763 --> 00:33:14.968
I think... I think if anything... We'll let you know, because I understand this.

00:33:15.088 --> 00:33:17.131
Oh, Cecilia's evil!

00:33:19.174 --> 00:33:19.454
Fuwawa's evil!

00:33:19.715 --> 00:33:20.456
So you understand.

00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:23.139
I understand this issue, this misunderstanding.

00:33:23.179 --> 00:33:25.122
It's a big misunderstanding!

00:33:25.142 --> 00:33:26.263
It is not true!

00:33:26.884 --> 00:33:29.087
But Cecilia, I... Ruffians!

00:33:29.793 --> 00:33:35.003
Sometimes... You know, we see everything, okay?

00:33:36.325 --> 00:33:45.362
Sometimes... Maybe some Ruffians taking a bit far.

00:33:48.949 --> 00:33:51.213
I'm not evil!

00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:51.533
I'm Fuwawa!

00:33:51.554 --> 00:33:52.375
She might be evil.

00:33:53.468 --> 00:34:01.701
That's because Fuwawa accidentally crushed my keyboard which was already being broken and didn't care about.

00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:05.467
It doesn't make her evil.

00:34:05.547 --> 00:34:10.515
That's because she said she wanted to pull out Mumei's feathers.

00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:28.133
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:29.929
It's up to Gigi.

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:32.071
Would you think that Gigi would lie?

00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:32.912
I don't think so.

00:34:33.253 --> 00:34:34.374
I think she would know the best.

00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:35.675
See?

00:34:36.556 --> 00:34:37.477
Mococo knows the best!

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:38.598
Fuwawa's not evil.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.321
So then if you ask Gigi, then she has the answer.

00:34:42.262 --> 00:34:43.163
Gigi is biased?

00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:43.744
No she's not.

00:34:43.764 --> 00:34:45.286
She knows the best.

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:45.446
Oh.

00:34:45.846 --> 00:34:47.308
See?

00:34:47.648 --> 00:34:48.229
You get it?

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:51.893
So, uh, it's misunderstanding.

00:34:51.873 --> 00:34:52.874
Understood.

00:34:52.894 --> 00:34:53.415
Is it?

00:34:53.435 --> 00:34:54.395
Yeah!

00:34:54.436 --> 00:34:55.316
Maybe not halfway.

00:34:57.879 --> 00:34:58.700
Almost understood.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.461
We need to ask Gigi.

00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:01.002
Okay.

00:35:01.442 --> 00:35:02.023
Got it.

00:35:02.043 --> 00:35:02.543
Got it.

00:35:03.084 --> 00:35:03.224
Got it.

00:35:03.805 --> 00:35:06.407
BAU BAU!

00:35:06.788 --> 00:35:08.890
There's still more misunderstandings, Moco-chan.

00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.752
Oh my god.

00:35:11.772 --> 00:35:12.593
Still more misunderstandings!

00:35:13.855 --> 00:35:14.155
BAU BAU!

00:35:20.281 --> 00:35:21.342
BAU BAU!

00:35:21.362 --> 00:35:21.542
FUWAMOCO!

00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:31.592
Congratulations on your 150th episode!

00:35:31.652 --> 00:35:41.885
Now, you probably have an idea why I'm here but... I would like to explain something.

00:35:42.305 --> 00:35:47.572
A misunderstanding perhaps that has happened recently to me.

00:35:47.592 --> 00:35:50.095
In a...

00:35:50.328 --> 00:35:58.697
In the previous stream of a game called Rust, there was an event called the Egg Hunt.

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:08.628
And when you get a golden egg, you can open it and receive a gun.

00:36:08.648 --> 00:36:09.749
A gun?

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:16.757
I was trying to tell my lovely kouhai, Su-chan and Shiha-chan, about this

00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:43.048
Kintamagun instead of Kino-tamagun.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:57.988
Maybe I have heard Kin-Tama before, but in that moment my mind was blank under the pressure of my kouhai.

00:36:58.229 --> 00:36:58.689
Pressure.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:59.891
The pressure.

00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:09.505
And I had just known that Kin meant gold and Tama meant egg or tamago.

00:37:10.386 --> 00:37:12.529
So I blurted out

00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:15.238
Kintama Gun!

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.304
From my... ...soul?

00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:21.664
Mouth.

00:37:25.668 --> 00:37:40.643
For those of you who don't know, who don't speak Japanese, Kintama is slang for a particular part of a...

00:37:42.277 --> 00:37:43.218
Dude.

00:37:43.238 --> 00:37:43.639
Huh?

00:37:43.659 --> 00:38:09.027
She just... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just said the... She just

00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:17.449
Thus, it resulted in a many shenanigans in my body muscle.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.133
I just wanted to clear that up.

00:38:19.394 --> 00:38:27.353
That no, I did not think originally balls when I said shintama.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:46.624
Balls gun!

00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:53.346
I did not, but from here on out, if I do say it, it is on purpose.

00:38:54.508 --> 00:38:58.497
Thank you for listening to my misunderstanding.

00:38:59.118 --> 00:39:00.501
Arigato gozaimasu.

00:39:01.243 --> 00:39:01.764
Sumimasen.

00:39:03.408 --> 00:39:04.410
Biboo, later.

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:18.886
I don't think it's a misunderstanding!

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:21.129
I don't think this was a misunderstanding!

00:39:21.269 --> 00:39:23.412
I don't think she's having fun with this!

00:39:23.512 --> 00:39:25.435
I think she's having fun too high!

00:39:25.455 --> 00:39:34.026
Is this FUWAMOCO Morning 150 or not?

00:39:36.402 --> 00:39:37.846
I think she's having fun.

00:39:37.966 --> 00:39:41.655
It's good though, you know, it's good to make mistakes learning a language.

00:39:42.036 --> 00:39:44.823
So, you know, it's a positive mistake.

00:39:44.843 --> 00:39:46.327
But she's a bit too proud.

00:39:46.728 --> 00:39:48.011
She's happy to learn a new language.

00:39:48.031 --> 00:39:49.615
She's a bit too proud.

00:39:50.157 --> 00:39:51.099
Learning is good.

00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:52.302
Yeah.

00:39:53.075 --> 00:39:54.297
Hamago.

00:39:54.978 --> 00:39:57.762
Have a hamago for breakfast.

00:39:58.022 --> 00:40:03.891
I made a mistake when I said Uma instead of Zuma.

00:40:04.772 --> 00:40:07.677
Somebody's wife became a horse.

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:11.703
This one is similar.

00:40:13.165 --> 00:40:13.986
Sort of.

00:40:14.354 --> 00:40:16.677
You know what?

00:40:16.697 --> 00:40:23.647
What was it that you said recently that you were a bird?

00:40:24.007 --> 00:40:24.248
What was it?

00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:28.534
It's that I was kind of, you know, I was tired.

00:40:29.295 --> 00:40:38.147
And I was trying to explain the situation that, you know, that our bags are at the hotel.

00:40:39.049 --> 00:40:42.994
And, you know, the bags, nimotsu.

00:40:43.953 --> 00:40:49.138
And instead, I said that the hotel they had are nimono.

00:40:49.178 --> 00:40:52.581
Instead of nimotsu.

00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:57.285
And I just kinda just went silent for a good 10 seconds.

00:40:57.305 --> 00:41:00.928
Because nimono means like a stewed food.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:07.874
Yeah, the hotel's taking care of my stewed food right now.

00:41:11.157 --> 00:41:11.918
You didn't want to say anything!

00:41:12.792 --> 00:41:16.156
I was just standing for 10 seconds on the lift!

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.481
BAU BAU!

00:41:21.402 --> 00:41:23.705
It happens!

00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:26.188
Misunderstood.

00:41:26.929 --> 00:41:29.993
That's hotel service!

00:41:30.013 --> 00:41:31.494
BAU BAU!

00:41:31.515 --> 00:41:33.197
At least Biboo's leading, right?

00:41:33.617 --> 00:41:34.458
Yes!

00:41:34.478 --> 00:41:36.100
Kawaii kara yurusu!

00:41:36.552 --> 00:41:37.915
Yurusanai!

00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:39.477
Yurusanai!

00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:41.882
Biboo's misunderstanding!

00:41:41.902 --> 00:41:45.008
It's understood that she's having fun.

00:41:45.028 --> 00:41:46.210
Yeah.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.635
BAU BAU!

00:41:48.775 --> 00:41:51.059
There's no more misunderstandings, right Moco-chan?

00:41:51.079 --> 00:41:52.101
That's it, right?

00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:54.185
Not a real misunderstanding in itself.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.892
Let's see.

00:41:57.912 --> 00:41:58.493
Okay.

00:42:02.995 --> 00:42:07.863
I had a misunderstanding pretty recently actually, kind of recently.

00:42:08.243 --> 00:42:25.611
I was in a different neighborhood and I thought to myself, oh yeah, wait a minute, someone, an old friend, an old friend, in fact a couple of old friends are in this neighborhood and I'd like to meet with them in the short time that I'm here.

00:42:25.591 --> 00:42:30.958
And so I got all excited and I contacted those friends and I said, hey, let's let's meet up.

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:34.382
I'm in the neighborhood on this particular date.

00:42:34.883 --> 00:42:37.286
Would you like to go to this particular restaurant?

00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:39.168
I made the reservation and everything.

00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:40.109
I was so excited.

00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:43.614
And that that friend and group of friends were like, yeah, let's do it.

00:42:43.954 --> 00:42:45.877
We're so excited to see you again, Mori.

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:46.577
It's been forever.

00:42:46.617 --> 00:42:47.398
Looking forward to it.

00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:50.422
And so I rock up to the restaurant and I'm chilling there and I'm waiting.

00:42:50.823 --> 00:42:52.645
And then it's like 10 minutes past.

00:42:52.656 --> 00:43:01.912
And I messaged them again like, hey, so let me know when you guys are going to be here because I'm just hanging out, you know, chilling.

00:43:01.932 --> 00:43:03.575
And they won't let me sit down until you guys are here.

00:43:03.595 --> 00:43:04.697
So I'm just standing here.

00:43:04.757 --> 00:43:07.121
So I was standing outside of the restaurant all alone.

00:43:07.542 --> 00:43:13.492
And, you know, all these groups of people passing by me noticing as I get sadder and sadder.

00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:18.140
And then after like 45 minutes, I'm like, oh, 45.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.694
I guess they're not coming.

00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:23.578
I guess they didn't want to hang out after all.

00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:26.122
And they didn't message me back at all.

00:43:26.823 --> 00:43:31.290
And so I walked all the way back to my hotel really sad and all these thoughts going through my head.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.174
I guess they really don't want to see me anymore.

00:43:34.935 --> 00:43:35.596
They hate me.

00:43:35.617 --> 00:43:36.037
They hate me.

00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:39.843
Then I get a message back being like, oh my god Mori, what?

00:43:40.023 --> 00:43:41.085
You went to the restaurant?

00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:47.134
But Mori, the message that you sent us says it's next month.

00:43:48.194 --> 00:43:50.840
You wanted to meet next month, right?

00:43:52.204 --> 00:44:02.068
I scroll up through my messages and lo and behold, Mori did say in the message to friends, you guys want to meet up?

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:07.927
On this date, and it was a month later from the day that I went to the restaurant and made the reservation.

00:44:08.007 --> 00:44:10.351
It was a big misunderstanding.

00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:12.935
But man, I felt a lot better after we got that cleared up.

00:44:13.315 --> 00:44:17.021
And then it turns out that they actually weren't busy that day, so we met up in the evening!

00:44:17.402 --> 00:44:18.944
So everything was fine in the end.

00:44:19.906 --> 00:44:20.226
This...

00:44:20.206 --> 00:44:22.769
This has happened more times than once.

00:44:23.689 --> 00:44:26.913
It happened with one of my other friends who writes manga.

00:44:28.094 --> 00:44:29.675
She was like, let's meet up on this day.

00:44:29.715 --> 00:44:33.299
And I went to a super far away area that we had chosen to meet.

00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:36.622
And I was like chilling there waiting like, alright I'm here sensei, what's going on?

00:44:37.163 --> 00:44:40.426
And then she messaged me back being like, Mori, next month, right?

00:44:42.448 --> 00:44:44.289
At least it's before, not after.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.872
So let's try and make sure this misunderstanding...

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.301
Doesn't happen anymore.

00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:50.664
That would be nice.

00:44:51.144 --> 00:44:52.005
But you guys know me.

00:44:53.127 --> 00:44:57.792
I'm a little... You knock knock on my head, you're gonna hear a big hollow sound.

00:44:58.693 --> 00:45:03.598
We love the hollow sound!

00:45:08.803 --> 00:45:09.344
BAU BAU!

00:45:09.364 --> 00:45:10.465
BAU BAU!

00:45:10.485 --> 00:45:10.805
I'm glad though!

00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:13.568
I don't wake up that tired.

00:45:13.749 --> 00:45:16.892
Actually though, I feel like... We've been on that before.

00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:18.663
Why?

00:45:19.265 --> 00:45:23.115
I think it's okay to tell you that, but she makes some mistakes sometimes.

00:45:23.195 --> 00:45:26.564
As long as it ends up alright.

00:45:26.584 --> 00:45:28.549
Is this... Is this a whole man thing?

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:28.890
Oh!

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:30.868
Getting the month wrong.

00:45:30.888 --> 00:45:35.175
Getting the month wrong by showing up on the wrong day and misunderstanding the date.

00:45:36.336 --> 00:45:38.980
I feel like it's happened to us a lot too!

00:45:39.641 --> 00:45:41.003
BAU BAU!

00:45:41.804 --> 00:45:44.829
It better be a month early than a month late at the most.

00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:46.030
Right?

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.411
Exactly!

00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:50.116
I think it's okay though.

00:45:50.136 --> 00:45:51.358
45 minutes wasted!

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:54.763
But a funny story gained, right?

00:45:54.783 --> 00:45:56.025
Eventually, no.

00:45:56.005 --> 00:45:59.688
Yeah, you believe how this happened to us a lot though.

00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.010
I feel like, you know, Cali-senpai!

00:46:02.951 --> 00:46:05.894
You know, she makes funny mistakes like that, it's funny.

00:46:06.114 --> 00:46:09.156
Because it's just, you know, like, oh, that's kind of... It happens.

00:46:09.257 --> 00:46:10.598
It's a gap, you know?

00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:11.639
Before it was pretty common.

00:46:12.479 --> 00:46:14.521
Now it's just pitiful.

00:46:14.621 --> 00:46:16.783
It's not fun anymore, it's just pitiful.

00:46:16.803 --> 00:46:17.123
Yeah.

00:46:17.664 --> 00:46:18.545
It's enduring!

00:46:19.706 --> 00:46:19.866
Right!

00:46:19.886 --> 00:46:20.947
For Cali-senpai.

00:46:21.227 --> 00:46:21.327
Yeah.

00:46:21.447 --> 00:46:23.309
Not for us.

00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:24.610
Inconvenient.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.730
Yeah.

00:46:25.331 --> 00:46:48.098
This is episode 159!

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:52.330
There's lots of misunderstandings when it's 150 episodes.

00:46:53.432 --> 00:46:55.154
This is the last one, okay?

00:46:55.214 --> 00:46:55.974
Last one.

00:46:56.535 --> 00:47:00.800
Okay, let's get this misunderstanding understood.

00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:01.661
Okay!

00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:01.841
BAU BAU!

00:47:11.072 --> 00:47:14.836
The next one, I... I feel like it's better this way.

00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:17.059
Huh?

00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:22.818
This is a message from Gigi!

00:47:23.158 --> 00:47:24.580
Okay, I hope it works.

00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:26.063
Let us know if it doesn't work, okay?

00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:30.109
Good morning.

00:47:30.149 --> 00:47:33.233
Hello, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:47:34.235 --> 00:47:43.849
Thank you to Fuwawa and Mococo for giving me the space to clear up some misunderstandings that have occurred on my channel.

00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:46.253
My channel is Gigi Moony.

00:47:46.503 --> 00:47:49.425
hololive English -Justice-.

00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:53.109
Sorry, I should have introduced myself.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:48:02.677
I'm Gigi Mooney of hololive English -Justice-, and I have some misunderstandings I would like to clear up on FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:48:03.217 --> 00:48:15.868
Sometimes on my channel, Gigi Mooney Channel, you might hear something that sounds suspiciously like barking in the background.

00:48:17.182 --> 00:48:20.245
Dog barking perhaps, but it is not.

00:48:20.585 --> 00:48:27.492
I would like everyone to know, formally and officially, that it is not a dog barking.

00:48:28.733 --> 00:48:30.795
There are no dogs barking in the background.

00:48:31.556 --> 00:48:35.539
I want everyone to stop saying it's a dog in the background.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.401
It is a bird.

00:48:37.641 --> 00:48:38.242
A bird!

00:48:38.823 --> 00:48:39.283
Thank you.

00:48:39.303 --> 00:48:41.265
Birds do that.

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.966
Birds do that, Moco-chan!

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:46.570
Birds do that.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:46.750
BAU BAU!

00:48:50.442 --> 00:48:52.985
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:48:56.449 --> 00:48:59.093
I feel scared now, Ruffians.

00:48:59.113 --> 00:49:00.034
Do you feel scared?

00:49:00.314 --> 00:49:05.340
Have we seen a bird before?

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.902
I haven't, no.

00:49:07.142 --> 00:49:09.625
Birds do that, I saw it on YouTube.

00:49:11.888 --> 00:49:15.893
I also saw a cat make a pizza on YouTube.

00:49:16.632 --> 00:49:18.535
What do we believe?

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:20.398
What do we not believe?

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.744
Do I not see it with our own eyes, huh?

00:49:24.846 --> 00:49:26.568
Maybe that was Nerissa!

00:49:29.193 --> 00:49:31.276
A lot of funny things are happening, huh?

00:49:31.977 --> 00:49:38.268
A lot of funny stuff, huh?

00:49:38.288 --> 00:49:38.869
That was GGOK!

00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:39.670
I'm not sure if I actually...

00:49:40.426 --> 00:49:41.989
It's all a misunderstanding!

00:49:43.092 --> 00:49:45.437
BAU BAU!

00:49:45.457 --> 00:49:45.958
BAU BAU!

00:49:45.978 --> 00:49:50.649
I don't know, I don't... I feel... By the way, no misunderstanding understood.

00:49:50.669 --> 00:49:53.575
It's more like misunderstanding unsettled.

00:49:54.449 --> 00:50:09.230
FUWAMOCO Morning means to you!

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:18.162
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:50:18.142 --> 00:50:28.118
You answered us a bunch of times with, you know, very very special messages, heartfelt feelings over on Twitter.

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:30.843
Thank you for using your hashtag!

00:50:30.863 --> 00:50:31.644
Hashtag FWMCMORNING150!

00:50:31.664 --> 00:50:33.086
BAU BAU!

00:50:34.088 --> 00:50:44.605
It made us really emotional, but it means a lot to us to know, you know, just what FUWAMOCO Morning means to you, how it impacts your day.

00:50:44.585 --> 00:50:58.712
Let's take a look at some of them!

00:50:59.092 --> 00:51:02.138
I see.

00:51:02.118 --> 00:51:04.543
BAU BAU!

00:51:04.563 --> 00:51:07.248
FUWAMOCO Morning a place to get even more smiles!

00:51:07.569 --> 00:51:10.995
There was a time when I found it got increasingly hard to smile.

00:51:11.396 --> 00:51:18.710
But after finding you two, I can't believe it myself that I've been smiling and laughing more than years before!

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.794
FUWAMOCO Morning definitely does that for me!

00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:22.297
BAU BAU!

00:51:22.317 --> 00:51:22.658
Thank you!

00:51:22.638 --> 00:51:31.227
I'm glad that maybe I can help start the day off on the right paw.

00:51:32.428 --> 00:51:36.432
FUWAMOCO Morning is a late afternoon for me.

00:51:37.073 --> 00:51:45.061
So rather than starting my day with it, it's a nice way to wind down and have fun with a bite-sized dream after a busy day.

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:48.645
I guess it can be a donut then.

00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:56.219
I always enjoy the hololive related news and Ruffian submissions!

00:51:57.641 --> 00:51:58.423
BAU BAU!

00:51:58.543 --> 00:51:58.984
Thank you!

00:51:59.004 --> 00:52:02.610
FUWAMOCO Morning 150 is usually at the end of a great day for me.

00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:05.976
I'm usually pretty tired and would like to go home.

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.498
That makes sense.

00:52:07.518 --> 00:52:14.610
But seeing FUWAMOCO so diligent with this series gives me great motivation to go to the gym for my workout and listen to them.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:18.596
I am glad I will probably use gym workout then!

00:52:18.776 --> 00:52:20.318
Maybe you're at the gym right now?

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.402
Squat harder!

00:52:23.844 --> 00:52:23.984
Harder!

00:52:24.425 --> 00:52:25.326
Lower down!

00:52:25.366 --> 00:52:26.668
You have to go lower down!

00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:29.653
Like you're sitting in the chair!

00:52:30.094 --> 00:52:30.174
Yes!

00:52:30.975 --> 00:52:32.157
Let's do it!

00:52:32.177 --> 00:52:32.297
Knees!

00:52:32.798 --> 00:52:33.499
Yes!

00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:36.604
It's the perfect way to end the day.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.083
BAU BAU!

00:52:41.686 --> 00:52:41.847
BAU BAU!

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:42.087
BAU BAU!

00:52:42.187 --> 00:52:46.794
The FUWAMOCO Morning brings the morning dose of sweetness needed to get through the day when life's rough.

00:52:47.415 --> 00:52:53.825
Hearing both girls give such warmth each FUWAMOCO Morning proves that you can always find the bright spot.

00:52:54.225 --> 00:52:57.711
Thank you Fuwa-chan and Moco-chan for bringing our days.

00:52:58.923 --> 00:53:02.052
I'm crying, you know?

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:04.596
Hopefully, especially, you know, during a bit

00:53:04.561 --> 00:53:04.701
BAU BAU

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.263
Darker deshita.

00:53:06.384 --> 00:53:07.505
One more time.

00:53:07.525 --> 00:53:08.567
I can be there for you.

00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:11.451
BAU BAU!

00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:18.602
Oh, I'm a college student right now, so whenever I get up early, it's easy to do schoolwork.

00:53:19.022 --> 00:53:25.772
But getting up on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays is never hard because FUWAMOCO are always there to cheer me on.

00:53:25.792 --> 00:53:26.233
BAU BAU!

00:53:26.213 --> 00:53:33.310
Even when I'm quiet, I'm always ready to BAU BAU to a new day!

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.031
It's time to wake up again!

00:53:34.252 --> 00:53:35.475
Classes might be soon.

00:53:36.197 --> 00:53:38.502
Hopefully not too soon.

00:53:38.937 --> 00:53:42.402
FUWAMOCO Morning is not long today, no?

00:53:42.422 --> 00:53:43.985
BAU BAU!

00:53:45.127 --> 00:53:47.470
And I'm awake when this stream is live.

00:53:47.811 --> 00:53:51.196
I'm unable to watch it, so I can only listen to it.

00:53:51.617 --> 00:53:53.079
But sometimes I peek at the stream.

00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:57.486
It's relaxing listening to YouTube while I wake up.

00:53:58.848 --> 00:53:58.988
Sneaky.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:13.720
Sometimes FUWAMOCO ask me why I'm smiling, and I think to myself, it's thanks to FUWAMOCO.

00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:36.017
For me, it's Japan time, so it's a bit different than most Ruffians.

00:54:36.037 --> 00:54:40.264
But for me, FUWAMOCO Morning is a way to end off

00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:42.787
That is the stream I end off my day with.

00:54:43.248 --> 00:54:46.372
Genki ippai na FUWAMOCO wo mite kara neru.

00:54:46.392 --> 00:54:49.616
I watch FUWAMOCO be all energetic and then sleep.

00:54:49.636 --> 00:54:53.562
Sono seikatsu ga watashi no taisetsu na jikan desu.

00:54:54.002 --> 00:54:57.487
That lifestyle is my precious time!

00:54:57.507 --> 00:55:04.396
Itsumo tanoshii jikan wo arigatou!

00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:06.138
Thank you for all the fun time!

00:55:06.158 --> 00:55:06.318
BAU BAU!

00:55:06.338 --> 00:55:06.499
BAU BAU!

00:55:06.519 --> 00:55:06.739
A nightcap!

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.802
I'm happy to be a nightcap.

00:55:08.822 --> 00:55:09.863
Maybe a little cup of

00:55:09.843 --> 00:55:11.547
Hot water before bed.

00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:16.160
BAU BAU!

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.348
Don't forget to brush your teeth again!

00:55:21.473 --> 00:55:26.687
At the start of this year, I broke my leg and couldn't go back to the city where I was studying.

00:55:27.376 --> 00:55:30.702
That means no work or study until my leg is fully healed.

00:55:31.403 --> 00:55:38.675
Thanks to FUWAMOCO Morning, I have motivation to wake up early and start studying again on my own.

00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:40.157
BAU BAU!

00:55:40.177 --> 00:55:43.483
I'm glad you know that we can protect your smile when things are really, really rough.

00:55:43.543 --> 00:55:50.194
When you get injured, it's such a blow, not only just physically, but mentally, emotionally.

00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:54.366
Just take it easy, okay?

00:55:56.409 --> 00:55:56.789
Stay strong!

00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:59.634
One step at a time, okay?

00:55:59.654 --> 00:55:59.874
BAU BAU!

00:55:59.894 --> 00:56:02.337
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i> to afternoon on my timezone.

00:56:02.678 --> 00:56:09.788
Just in time for work's break, so it always gives me a huge boost to keep the day going, especially on raw four days.

00:56:10.209 --> 00:56:13.774
It's a very comfy and relaxing show that never fails to make me smile.

00:56:13.814 --> 00:56:18.040
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:18.561
BAU BAU!

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:23.569
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:31.623
Thank you so much for all your special feelings sharing with us what FUWAMOCO Morning means to you.

00:56:32.163 --> 00:56:32.764
Thank you.

00:56:33.185 --> 00:56:40.437
And you know, we thought that we share with you what FUWAMOCO Morning means to us.

00:56:40.457 --> 00:56:41.038
I know.

00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:48.109
For us, FUWAMOCO Morning is an important time we spend together.

00:56:48.129 --> 00:56:50.052
You know, three times a week.

00:56:50.412 --> 00:56:51.714
You know, all the time.

00:56:51.834 --> 00:56:58.461
And it may not be anything super fancy or deluxe everyday, but you know, it's the everyday time.

00:56:58.902 --> 00:57:05.770
Just these sort of silly little moments that we get to spend together that makes it truly special to us, you know.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:07.752
And, uh, Ruffians!

00:57:07.732 --> 00:57:17.782
That you wake up early maybe, or find time in the middle of your day, or right after a busy day, that you find that moment to be able to spend together with us.

00:57:17.802 --> 00:57:19.143
It is the life!

00:57:19.163 --> 00:57:23.668
It makes it really special to us, and we feel so lucky to have that time with you.

00:57:23.688 --> 00:57:26.711
So thank you, Ruffians!

00:57:26.731 --> 00:57:27.472
Thank you!

00:57:27.492 --> 00:57:29.214
Thank you, FUWAMOCO, for being a part of your life.

00:57:29.814 --> 00:57:32.237
It means a lot to us.

00:57:33.258 --> 00:57:33.458
Thank you!

00:57:33.478 --> 00:57:33.638
BAU BAU!

00:57:33.618 --> 00:57:34.479
Hi!

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.542
We made it!

00:57:36.602 --> 00:57:37.363
Doggie of the Day!

00:57:37.403 --> 00:57:38.144
Doggie of the Day!

00:57:38.164 --> 00:57:41.268
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:57:41.288 --> 00:57:43.450
We have De-den!

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.413
Today's Doggie of the Day is Gus!

00:57:45.433 --> 00:57:48.637
Gus!

00:57:48.777 --> 00:57:48.937
Welcome!

00:57:48.957 --> 00:57:49.277
Look at Gus!

00:57:49.297 --> 00:57:51.400
Gus, what are you doing on the floor there?

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.242
Gus is really soft, but I... Why?

00:57:53.262 --> 00:57:55.065
I want to pet Gus backwards.

00:57:56.286 --> 00:57:57.508
He's so silly!

00:57:58.088 --> 00:58:00.992
Wait, does he look a bit... Healthy?

00:58:01.597 --> 00:58:04.861
Maybe he just needs headpats!

00:58:05.261 --> 00:58:05.382
Maybe!

00:58:05.442 --> 00:58:10.027
Gus has been a part of this Ruffian's lovely family for over a decade!

00:58:11.128 --> 00:58:11.729
So long!

00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:13.812
It's been, it's kinda hard to remember.

00:58:13.832 --> 00:58:15.794
Is that the best though?

00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:18.537
That means you just had so much good times together!

00:58:18.557 --> 00:58:21.861
It's so much fun that you kind of forgot the years, right?

00:58:21.881 --> 00:58:30.692
But he's extra silly and I can definitely kind of see if you remove the text there, you can see a traffic cone.

00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:35.439
That's so cute!

00:58:35.459 --> 00:58:35.659
I love it!

00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:38.022
And he's meaty too!

00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:38.703
Gosh.

00:58:39.585 --> 00:58:39.845
Gosh.

00:58:40.907 --> 00:58:46.655
Moco-chan, how does gosh bow bow?

00:58:46.675 --> 00:58:47.917
Bow wow.

00:58:47.937 --> 00:58:49.138
Bow wow.

00:58:50.721 --> 00:58:51.602
That's a good tropical one.

00:58:52.063 --> 00:58:55.367
I try it.

00:58:55.387 --> 00:58:56.629
Bow wow.

00:58:57.115 --> 00:59:01.179
Does that sound like Traffic Code C?

00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:02.788
I think that sounds just like us.

00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:08.866
Yeah!

00:59:08.886 --> 00:59:09.467
BAU BAU!

00:59:09.487 --> 00:59:09.727
BAU BAU!

00:59:09.747 --> 00:59:14.712
Akko's just such a beautiful boy with a lovely neck and underbite too!

00:59:14.732 --> 00:59:16.114
Very cute!

00:59:16.334 --> 00:59:16.814
Definitely not guilty.

00:59:16.834 --> 00:59:19.357
And look at those fluffy ears too!

00:59:20.038 --> 00:59:20.598
Right!

00:59:20.619 --> 00:59:22.100
So cute!

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.203
Even if he's a needy boy, that's okay!

00:59:25.223 --> 00:59:26.705
There's nothing wrong with that!

00:59:26.725 --> 00:59:27.426
Right!

00:59:27.446 --> 00:59:32.031
You have lots and lots of love and cuddles to give him, right?

00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:32.171
Right!

00:59:32.191 --> 00:59:34.934
Lots of high fives and neck ruffles, right?

00:59:34.954 --> 00:59:35.294
Okay!

00:59:35.314 --> 00:59:36.015
BAU BAU!

00:59:35.995 --> 00:59:37.858
BAU BAU!

00:59:37.998 --> 00:59:41.564
If you want to pet the ears, you can pet Gus' ears.

00:59:41.725 --> 00:59:44.229
Gus is happy to take the ear pats.

00:59:44.249 --> 00:59:46.312
FUWAMOCO no.

00:59:47.314 --> 00:59:47.795
BAU BAU!

00:59:47.815 --> 00:59:51.942
And next we have... Today I went on a walk with Ruffians!

00:59:52.523 --> 00:59:56.610
I've been able to go on a walk with such nice Ruffians!

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:57.070
Let's take a look!

00:59:57.812 --> 00:59:59.895
We have... De-den!

01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:01.598
What?

01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:02.311
A what?

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:02.973
A cafe!

01:00:03.214 --> 01:00:03.695
Huh?

01:00:03.715 --> 01:00:05.460
Cafe bar!

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.483
Oh, a bar!

01:00:06.844 --> 01:00:08.329
Cafe bar!

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.575
It looks like a fancy cafe!

01:00:11.639 --> 01:00:15.269
Maybe it's a bit more fancy than Buffy and Buzzy.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:15.971
Maybe.

01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:16.072
Huh?

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:18.278
I don't know.

01:00:18.298 --> 01:00:20.364
What kind of food do you think they sell?

01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:23.494
I don't think they have doughnuts there, no.

01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:24.697
Maybe they bust?

01:00:24.647 --> 01:00:24.767
A what

01:00:25.439 --> 01:00:27.084
Popular cool hit music.

01:00:27.104 --> 01:00:31.438
Even though it's not Fuwafuwaa Mocomoco.

01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:34.066
Or it wouldn't be like them.

01:00:34.828 --> 01:00:37.356
Fuwafuwaa Mocomoco.

01:00:37.943 --> 01:00:39.345
Is that cool or fancy?

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:43.252
I tried to make it cool or fancy, Moco-chan!

01:00:43.713 --> 01:00:44.434
I don't know.

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.976
I need more instruments.

01:00:47.138 --> 01:00:49.362
Can you give me more instruments?

01:00:51.446 --> 01:00:53.529
Is that an instrument?

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.992
That's just a backing vocal!

01:00:56.674 --> 01:00:58.838
Well, it definitely has cool music.

01:01:00.252 --> 01:01:26.040
Today's question is...

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.064
It's the annual plum season again!

01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:30.628
I used two large jars this year.

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:38.001
If nothing goes wrong, I can drink them until the end of the year after next, and then use the new ones.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:39.904
FUWAMOCO, do you like plums?

01:01:40.185 --> 01:01:42.108
Why are you afraid of the sourness?

01:01:44.713 --> 01:01:45.514
BAU BAU!

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:46.597
Ruffians.

01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:51.683
We love plums!

01:01:51.923 --> 01:01:56.128
And it looks like so much fun in the forms that you set too, you know?

01:01:56.369 --> 01:01:58.111
Putting all the plums and making plum?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:58.852
Oh syrup!

01:01:59.052 --> 01:01:59.993
Syrup, maybe!

01:02:00.354 --> 01:02:02.576
That would be super yummy!

01:02:02.596 --> 01:02:06.381
We like umeboshi and anything plum flavored!

01:02:06.401 --> 01:02:08.564
Yeah, and dried plums too!

01:02:08.944 --> 01:02:10.446
They're good for you!

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.247
I just like them.

01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:13.830
Umeboshi incident!

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.212
I don't remember.

01:02:15.974 --> 01:02:16.836
Morning-chan.

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:22.591
Hi?

01:02:22.611 --> 01:02:22.712
Yeah.

01:02:22.732 --> 01:02:25.379
But we hope it went so well!

01:02:25.399 --> 01:02:25.499
Yeah!

01:02:25.519 --> 01:02:27.163
I'd like to try doing this one day too.

01:02:27.324 --> 01:02:27.845
Right!

01:02:27.865 --> 01:02:28.467
Right!

01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:29.389
I wanna make that one.

01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:35.710
Have fun FUWAMOCO!

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.155
Thank you so much Ruffians for all your submissions!

01:02:39.495 --> 01:02:43.721
Not just you know, your questions, your Doggie of the Day, your Pero Sighting, your vlogs.

01:02:44.102 --> 01:02:49.369
Thank you also for sharing you know, all your special memories, feelings with us.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:54.655
What FUWAMOCO Morning means to you?

01:02:54.675 --> 01:02:56.557
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

01:02:56.577 --> 01:02:57.679
It means so much!

01:02:57.739 --> 01:03:00.722
After today, it will be the 150th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:03.746
We'll still be looking for more questions!

01:03:03.766 --> 01:03:05.648
You don't hear the name Pero Sightings?

01:03:06.148 --> 01:03:08.411
I don't know what you think it's doing.

01:03:09.532 --> 01:03:12.135
Nobody needs to know this question.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:12.876
I just answered the question.

01:03:14.155 --> 01:03:19.503
And don't forget to use the hashtag!

01:03:19.523 --> 01:03:21.005
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:22.587

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:34.664
Thank you for making FUWAMOCO Morning together with us, FUWAMOCO!

01:03:34.684 --> 01:03:35.486
Let's continue for another 150 episodes!

01:03:35.506 --> 01:03:35.666
BAU BAU!

01:03:36.267 --> 01:03:38.610
And next, we have...

01:03:38.843 --> 01:03:39.965
It's a dream coming up.

01:03:40.385 --> 01:03:45.493
Listen, I'm a Ruffian, so no don't yell.

01:03:46.976 --> 01:03:47.276
You wanna know?

01:03:47.296 --> 01:03:50.521
I wanna know, Moco-chan, let's take a look.

01:03:55.569 --> 01:03:56.691
Share with the Ruffians!

01:03:57.312 --> 01:03:59.535
Yeah, we're gonna be chatting!

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:01.287
POPT!

01:04:01.908 --> 01:04:05.836
Today we're going to be chatting about the traveling we did.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.218
We took a mini vacation.

01:04:07.298 --> 01:04:09.142
Our first mini vacation.

01:04:09.162 --> 01:04:12.107
And we went and saw a bunch of places.

01:04:12.127 --> 01:04:14.331
So we want to share some photos with you.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.716
Talk about where we was and that.

01:04:16.736 --> 01:04:19.641
The kind of experiences we had.

01:04:19.721 --> 01:04:21.304
How trouble we got into.

01:04:21.284 --> 01:04:22.625
Yeah!

01:04:22.966 --> 01:04:24.087
Definitely no trouble.

01:04:24.888 --> 01:04:31.014
So please come listen to Ruffians!

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:32.375

01:04:32.896 --> 01:04:33.296

01:04:33.356 --> 01:04:35.198
We also have a brand new schedule!

01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:36.780
Do you wanna see the schedule?

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.041
I'm excited for this week!

01:04:38.481 --> 01:04:46.349
I wanna show it to the Ruffians so we have to wait!

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:47.110
Schedule, yeah.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.072
Yes!

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:50.093
De-den!

01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:52.317
Our schedule!

01:04:53.500 --> 01:05:06.732
Like I mentioned, tonight at 6pm we're gonna be chatting about a travel we did, but on Tuesday starting at 6pm PT, we're gonna be starting Metal Gear Solid 3!

01:05:06.712 --> 01:05:09.636
It's been a little while.

01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:11.118
Just a little bit.

01:05:11.138 --> 01:05:14.724
A year since we last played Metal Gear Solid 2!

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:19.010
But we're gonna be continuing through with Metal Gear Solid 3 on the PS2!

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:20.372
Yeah, it's slated.

01:05:20.672 --> 01:05:21.593
Everything's working.

01:05:21.653 --> 01:05:22.635
We're all good to go.

01:05:22.655 --> 01:05:23.636
Check that it's working.

01:05:23.656 --> 01:05:24.397
It is working.

01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:26.340
Kept us waiting, huh?

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.482
Kind of, huh?

01:05:29.264 --> 01:05:31.267
We have a memory card.

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:34.472
Yeah.

01:05:34.492 --> 01:05:34.592
Yeah.

01:05:36.985 --> 01:05:40.051
FUWAMOCO And then on Wednesday we're gonna be having fun!

01:05:40.071 --> 01:05:41.674
Good morning!

01:05:41.895 --> 01:05:47.185
Then on Thursday I think we're gonna get a little bit busy!

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:50.472
At 3am PT we're gonna be doing

01:05:50.857 --> 01:05:56.004
FUWAMOCO May Cafe is gonna be open again!

01:05:56.024 --> 01:05:56.484
May Cafe Totsumachi!

01:05:56.504 --> 01:05:59.689
We're gonna be, you know, opening the cafe once more.

01:05:59.749 --> 01:06:02.993
What kind of customers will join us?

01:06:03.013 --> 01:06:03.934
Will we get any customers?

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:06.257
Are we gonna go out of business?

01:06:06.277 --> 01:06:07.079
I hope we do!

01:06:07.539 --> 01:06:08.000
What?!

01:06:09.342 --> 01:06:10.042
I hope we get customers!

01:06:10.062 --> 01:06:12.726
Not that we go out of business, Moco-chan!

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.252
BAU BAU.

01:06:17.722 --> 01:06:24.110
But we're gonna do our best and hopefully we can come up with some new menu items.

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.734
And then on Thursday, it's a little bit different.

01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:34.522
On Thursday evening at 6pm, we're gonna be having a Rock n' Wood Party!

01:06:34.542 --> 01:06:36.364
The first one in a long time!

01:06:36.384 --> 01:06:37.746
In a little while.

01:06:37.926 --> 01:06:41.330
But this time we also have a special announcement.

01:06:44.214 --> 01:06:46.176
Special announcement.

01:06:50.678 --> 01:06:54.927
So we hope that you look forward to that in the afterword!

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.472
Well, we're gonna have more fun.

01:06:57.753 --> 01:07:02.002
Because it's time for Doggy Code Country 2!

01:07:02.022 --> 01:07:02.242
And 10PLPT!

01:07:02.382 --> 01:07:05.609
We'll do our best to get as far as we can!

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.676
We're getting pretty close to the end now, the final boss.

01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:10.780
We just need to say it right.

01:07:12.768 --> 01:07:15.732
Let's hope we don't die before we see you.

01:07:15.752 --> 01:07:19.378
And on Friday starts with another FUWAMOCO Morning!

01:07:19.678 --> 01:07:27.790
And at 5pm PT, we're gonna be starting off our mini horror game matsuri!

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:30.914
It's gonna be like a bunch of different horror games!

01:07:30.934 --> 01:07:33.358
Short horror games!

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:35.773
We don't know if some will work.

01:07:36.354 --> 01:07:38.337
Are some gonna be too membe?

01:07:38.798 --> 01:07:40.640
Are some gonna be really scary?

01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:42.503
Are we gonna complete some of them?

01:07:43.224 --> 01:07:43.725
We don't know.

01:07:44.146 --> 01:07:46.229
We don't know what games we're gonna play yet.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:50.575
But we'll have a lot of fun together, Ruffians!

01:07:50.595 --> 01:07:51.837
Hopefully it doesn't be too scary.

01:07:52.171 --> 01:08:05.203
But, you know, in between, we're also gonna do, you know, have a nice little moment because we're gonna be doing some fishing!

01:08:05.864 --> 01:08:06.224
Yeah!

01:08:06.845 --> 01:08:07.245

01:08:15.513 --> 01:08:16.434
Right after fishing.

01:08:16.854 --> 01:08:19.056
