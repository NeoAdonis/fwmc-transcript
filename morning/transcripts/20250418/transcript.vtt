00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.612
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.028
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.635
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:35.739
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.305
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:42.793
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.254 --> 00:05:44.817
BAU BAU!

00:05:44.837 --> 00:05:45.178
Good morning!

00:05:45.158 --> 00:05:50.984
Thank you for joining us today for our 149th episode!

00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:52.486
BAU BAU!

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:55.409
Thank you!

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.613
One episode before the big milestone!

00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:00.555
BAU BAU!

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:02.857

00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:04.038
So soon!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.884
Ruffians!

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:10.566
What do you think?

00:06:10.586 --> 00:06:12.067
Are you proud of us?

00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:14.710
You are praised already!

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.601
Is that not allowed?

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:29.891
149 episodes!

00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:34.057
It's just about approaching our 150th episode!

00:06:34.357 --> 00:06:39.043
But any Ruffians who maybe this is your first episode.

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:45.914
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:46.856
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.981
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:55.910
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:56.471
Yeah!

00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:57.333
Okay, got that!

00:06:57.873 --> 00:06:58.274
Now!

00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:01.299
You know what I'm gonna say, but I'll tell you anyway!

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.361
What are you gonna say, Moco-chan?

00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:05.706
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:07:06.985 --> 00:07:09.629
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.976
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:14.996 --> 00:07:17.539
BAU BAU!

00:07:19.642 --> 00:07:21.144
Thank you Ruffians.

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:23.107
Nice big BAU BAU.

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.612
You know it's just about the weekend.

00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:28.314
Exciting weekend.

00:07:30.077 --> 00:07:30.457
Moco-chan.

00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:34.022
We have some exciting things to share with the Ruffians, right?

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:47.968
Nothing like a Pero Sighting, right?

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.970
Pero.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.190
Wait, huh?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.391
Ruffians!

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.759
You ain't looking forward to a Pero Sighting, are you?

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:55.761
Pero doko?

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:57.864
Is that like a doko?

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:59.828
I want to know doko!

00:07:59.848 --> 00:08:00.889
You need to lulu us for the thing!

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:02.592
Because it shouldn't be like that, Ruffians.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.482
Pero is still alive.

00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:08.745
He's a demon dog.

00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:13.032
That question, I can't tell if you want it or don't.

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:15.697
I guess you just want the facts, huh?

00:08:15.717 --> 00:08:17.560
Moco-chan, was there a Pero Sighting?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.247
There was a Pero Sighting.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.352
BAU BAU!

00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:25.374
Let's take a look!

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:28.039
Ruffians, where did you see Pero this time?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:39.244
De-den!

00:08:39.663 --> 00:08:44.329
Pero, about hiding in our- You both.

00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:44.609
Ruffians!

00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:47.873
Are you hallucinating?

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:50.757
Are you seeing things that don't exist?

00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:56.564
Ruffians, there's no way Pero's hiding or has ever seen it in our fluff and fuzz before.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.387
Never ever.

00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:01.030
Not our tails.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.032
Pero does it again.

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:03.654
What do you mean does it again?

00:09:03.674 --> 00:09:06.779
We're clean demon dogs.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:06.899
Yeah.

00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:10.845
Our ears aren't nasty.

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:11.526
No, no, no.

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:12.227
We have fuzz.

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:16.273
Maybe Moco-chan has her fuzz, but... No nasty.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:17.154
No Pero.

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:20.299
Why do we have Pero in our- Ruffians.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.861
Pero's not there.

00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.444
You're seeing things.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.870
Ruffians!

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:30.274
No.

00:09:34.068 --> 00:09:35.650
Well, it's a good thing.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.714
I think it's good that you can take a break.

00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:52.653
And, uh, maybe during that break time, you can go and, uh, get your eyes checked!

00:09:53.374 --> 00:09:55.536
Yeah!

00:09:56.257 --> 00:09:56.798
Yeah!

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.381
Yeah!

00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:01.444
Yeah!

00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:02.826
Uh.

00:10:03.987 --> 00:10:05.129
Huh?

00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:06.671
You can't ask to pet him.

00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.637
He's not there.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.141
Yeah.

00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:13.502
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.562 --> 00:10:14.183
Got it!

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:15.465
Your eyes are fine.

00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:16.486
I disagree.

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:18.930
Like to differ.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.252
Time to go to the doctor.

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:21.254
BAU BAU!

00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:24.379
Wow!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.482
We have some exciting news!

00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:28.425
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:37.246
I released a brand new cover song a few weeks ago of Ayaka's Crescent Moon!

00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:37.426
BAU BAU!

00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:44.423
Thanks to your Ruffians, it just reached 250k views on YouTube!

00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:48.068
Thank you!

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:54.917
This time it's the English version of a Japanese song called Mikazuki.

00:10:55.337 --> 00:11:04.830
I know I've talked about it before, but even though it can be hard to believe, it's very difficult for us hololive EN members to cover songs in English.

00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:10.157
So we're really happy to finally be able to sing a song in English.

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:29.935
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:49.982
FUWAMOCO Sing it with.

00:11:51.346 --> 00:12:02.706
FUWAMOCO Congratulations!

00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:05.731
FUWAMOCO Congratulations!

00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:10.620
FUWAMOCO Congratulations!

00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:12.096
Thank you!

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:13.859
We'll continue to do our best!

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:20.229
Practice our singing so you know we can improve and hopefully reach you even more through our voice too!

00:12:21.051 --> 00:12:21.732
Thank you!

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:23.735
Love you!

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:26.820
Bye bye!

00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:32.884
Thank you!

00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:48.927
I think there's going to be some voice singing going on because very soon, Yara-senpai is going to be having a very special 3D

00:12:48.907 --> 00:12:51.372
Spring Party coming up!

00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:53.476
BAU BAU!

00:12:54.437 --> 00:13:00.288
It's gonna be on April 20th and at 5pm PT.

00:13:04.757 --> 00:13:08.704
So we hope that you'll join over on Kiara-senpai's channel.

00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:16.195
You know, this time it's a bit different.

00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:20.742
This time it's a concert with only EN members as guests.

00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:29.816
And actually, also only features songs from an idol agency famous for groups like Anusha if you heard Morning Musumen.

00:13:30.597 --> 00:13:32.881
Yeah, the idol agency Hello Project.

00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:33.662
Yeah, Hello Project.

00:13:33.642 --> 00:13:36.766
It's okay.

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:37.067
Yeah!

00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:38.028
Hello Project Morning Musume!

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:39.530
Yeah!

00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:44.898
But Kiara-senpai is a very big fan of Hello Project, or HP.

00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:45.018
Yeah!

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:49.664
And FUWAMOCO, we are too, I think, much more casual.

00:13:50.526 --> 00:13:52.228
We didn't have an oshi in particular.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.311
A bit more hako-oshi.

00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:56.895
Oh, you know, you like everybody.

00:13:57.275 --> 00:13:57.515
Yeah!

00:13:57.576 --> 00:13:58.637
So actually!

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.342
FUWAMOCO.

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:08.035
We're extremely excited to be also invited as guests together in Advent too!

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:10.500
Yeah!

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.221
BAU BAU!

00:14:13.084 --> 00:14:13.345
Yeah!

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:13.585
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:13.785
Yeah!

00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:15.842
One time I became eggs recently, huh?

00:14:16.324 --> 00:14:21.681
That's amazing But you know... That's exciting!

00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:23.306
Exciting, yes I did it

00:14:23.302 --> 00:14:23.342
FU

00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:41.719

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:46.828
Morning Musume.

00:14:49.312 --> 00:15:02.695
Matsura Aya.

00:15:03.687 --> 00:15:11.298
You know, obviously, we're really excited for you!

00:15:11.318 --> 00:15:13.761
Please come join us, okay?

00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:15.303
We hope you'll check it out, okay?

00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:15.544
FUWAMOCO!

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:21.913
Dancing and singing together with Kiara-senpai!

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:23.335
BAU BAU!

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.957
Exciting, yeah!

00:15:24.997 --> 00:15:28.482
You're not familiar with the whole project?

00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:32.648
After Kiara-senpai's spring party, maybe it won't be that hard.

00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:40.596
BAU BAU!

00:15:41.521 --> 00:15:42.422
Eh?

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.525
A big news going on!

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:46.346
Big news!

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:47.988
This is something I'm really excited about.

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:48.128
Right!

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:48.329
Big news!

00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:48.609
Hoho Ien!

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:49.770
Wow!

00:15:50.311 --> 00:15:51.032
Hoho Ien!

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:57.519
You might be finding some of us at sushi restaurants across America!

00:15:57.539 --> 00:16:05.087
Because there's gonna be a special collab started in July 2025 at Kura Sushi in the U.S.!

00:16:05.108 --> 00:16:09.132
This time it's featuring Ura-senpai, Saki-senpai, and Gigi!

00:16:09.112 --> 00:16:14.381
So you know, if you go to Kurasushi right now, it's around $70.

00:16:14.922 --> 00:16:15.503
Right now?

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:17.586
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's already going on.

00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:19.429
Coming July 2025.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.833
Yeah, that's when they get serious about it, you know.

00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:22.254
Why?

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:31.069
But right now, if you spend around $70, you can get an extra special exclusive gear pass.

00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:36.341
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:46.746
Have a howl of a day!

00:16:47.063 --> 00:16:55.260
We will talk about sushi at 8am if it involves Ina-senpai, Korone-senpai, and GD!

00:16:57.324 --> 00:16:58.987
I'm really excited!

00:16:59.628 --> 00:17:02.895
It's just starting to heat up a little bit, you know?

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:07.501
I'm sure there'll be a lot more coming out once it gets closer to the summer time.

00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:09.784
Summer equals sushi.

00:17:09.804 --> 00:17:10.064
Yeah.

00:17:10.084 --> 00:17:11.787
So, Ruffians!

00:17:11.807 --> 00:17:15.351
I hope that you're ready to eat some good sushi and grapple!

00:17:15.512 --> 00:17:18.756
Yeah, you know, the exclusive gear pass.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:24.343
Yeah, this sushi collab is made in the U.S.A!

00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:28.569
By the way, Ruffians, I think I see a lot of questions.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.174
FUWAMOCO's favorite sushi.

00:17:32.294 --> 00:17:32.494
Moco-chan.

00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.741
Tuna.

00:17:36.603 --> 00:17:37.885

00:17:38.386 --> 00:17:39.889
The Basics.

00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:41.612
Inari Sushi.

00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:44.518
I like the hotate.

00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:52.833
I like saying hotate more than eating hotate.

00:17:52.853 --> 00:17:54.516
Hotate!

00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:56.134
Yeah.

00:17:56.796 --> 00:17:58.281
Perfect choices.

00:17:58.341 --> 00:18:00.869
Unagi is good too, yeah!

00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:04.903
But unagi sushi can't really find in Japan, right?

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:06.548
I don't know.

00:18:06.568 --> 00:18:08.494
I have a book.

00:18:08.675 --> 00:18:08.775
Yeah.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.806
But exciting!

00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:15.011
Please keep your eyes out, okay?

00:18:15.051 --> 00:18:17.837
You know, asking them to check their eyes again?

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:19.180
Yeah.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.881
This is third time.

00:18:21.003 --> 00:18:23.549
BAU BAU!

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:30.122
Ruffians!

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:50.271
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:53.354
Okayu-senpai!

00:18:53.374 --> 00:19:00.260
She released a very special visual novel game for Okayu-nyuumu!

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:07.726
A visual novel where she's the heroine, the main character, you know, and maybe you kind of fall in love with her.

00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:08.387
We don't know.

00:19:08.627 --> 00:19:19.617
We don't know because up until now it's only been released in Japanese, but it was just announced that Okayu-nyuumu...

00:19:19.597 --> 00:19:27.110
Okayu Ryoma is going to be coming out in English!

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.511
BAU BAU!

00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:32.980
And also available on Steam this summer!

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.382
We're really excited!

00:19:34.703 --> 00:19:38.529
If you don't know already, FUWAMOCO really like visual novels.

00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:40.713
If you've never heard of a visual novel, what's that?

00:19:40.753 --> 00:19:41.514
A book?

00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:42.536
It is a game.

00:19:43.338 --> 00:19:44.760
It's a game, not a book.

00:19:45.095 --> 00:19:50.621
It's not a book, and you know, it's a very good story!

00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:50.921
Visuals!

00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.023
Music!

00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:59.831
And you know, there's multiple choices so you get to control the story until it's right!

00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:03.775
It's a game because you click yes and you enjoy it.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:10.883
You know, but we've heard a lot of things about Wakai and Yumu.

00:20:10.863 --> 00:20:15.329
Uh, maybe it's a little bit spicy at times.

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:16.291
Why is it so funny?

00:20:17.212 --> 00:20:20.316
Why talk to Ako-senpai about playing her version of a song?

00:20:20.377 --> 00:20:22.059
She's embarrassing.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:24.943
Why talk to Karin-senpai about playing it?

00:20:24.963 --> 00:20:26.826
She was not.

00:20:26.846 --> 00:20:27.927
She's excited!

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.072
She's like, yes, please!

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:31.993
FUWAMOCO, yes!

00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:47.805
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.205
FUWAMOCO is one of our big dreams.

00:20:52.225 --> 00:20:56.411
Our big goal is to release our own visual novel one day.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:21:00.397
And actually, that's what we want to use our 1 million wish for.

00:21:01.018 --> 00:21:02.580
In case you've forgotten.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.304
But that's still TBD, TBD.

00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:06.666
Haven't heard anything.

00:21:06.686 --> 00:21:07.487
TBD, TBA.

00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:09.169
What's the other ones?

00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:11.552
All the ones.

00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:16.937
But continue working towards that dream!

00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:20.200
I think slowly, but surely!

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.282
To be continued.

00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:29.509
BAU BAU!

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:30.730
Exciting!

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.571
Why are you exciting?

00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:37.336
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:21:37.356 --> 00:21:37.536
Ruffians!

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:45.603
It's actually been a few styling.

00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:46.283
Update to FUWAMOCO!

00:21:46.303 --> 00:21:47.424
Huh?

00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:49.827
Have you noticed anything Ruffians?

00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:59.816
Have you noticed?

00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:00.777
I don't think any Ruffians noticed.

00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:01.678
I don't think they have.

00:22:01.698 --> 00:22:01.818
Oh no.

00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:01.938
Yeah.

00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.079
Sometimes the Ruffians don't notice.

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:03.199
Yeah.

00:22:03.219 --> 00:22:04.941
Sometimes I was like a weirdo, but sometimes I'm really really cute.

00:22:08.245 --> 00:22:13.273
It looks like we're gonna have to give a hint to the Ruffians, huh?

00:22:13.293 --> 00:22:14.835
Here I go, Ruffians!

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:17.299
Big updates to FUWAMOCO!

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:20.083
De-den!

00:22:20.103 --> 00:22:23.248
Well, first... De-den!

00:22:25.652 --> 00:22:26.033
Moco-chan.

00:22:26.874 --> 00:22:28.296
Where's Fuwawa?

00:22:34.098 --> 00:22:36.040
Hi!

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.441
What does this mean?

00:22:38.242 --> 00:22:43.868
I have my photo retaken.

00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:47.091
You noticed!

00:22:49.053 --> 00:22:51.815
Do I look cuter?

00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:58.362
Do you notice a difference?

00:22:58.902 --> 00:22:58.962
No.

00:22:58.982 --> 00:22:59.083
Cute!

00:22:59.103 --> 00:22:59.203
Cute!

00:22:59.623 --> 00:23:00.204
Cute!

00:23:00.224 --> 00:23:00.324
Cute!

00:23:01.105 --> 00:23:02.586
You look cuter!

00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:05.978
Such change, you're even cuter!

00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:09.471
I don't think the Ruffians realize.

00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:12.595
I hear Fuwawa saying, oh cute it, cute it, but I don't see the Ruffians say that.

00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:16.940
I'm seeing, I'm hearing it, but I'm not seeing it.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.885
I think the Ruffians are just taking this opportunity to call you cute, huh, Moco-chan?

00:23:22.507 --> 00:23:22.867
They should.

00:23:22.887 --> 00:23:24.870
They should take the opportunity often.

00:23:28.394 --> 00:23:32.139
But, but Moco-chan, I'm not getting replaced or anything, right?

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:33.020
No.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.041
We're still gonna be...

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:36.228
Not, not Mocomoco.

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:38.230
Yeah.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.630
Mocomoco.

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:40.371
Yeah.

00:23:40.392 --> 00:23:41.352
No.

00:23:41.372 --> 00:23:41.593
FUWAMOCO?

00:23:42.073 --> 00:23:43.054
Yes.

00:23:43.134 --> 00:23:44.055
Okay, good.

00:23:44.075 --> 00:23:46.517
I was nervous when you said I'm not getting replaced, huh?

00:23:46.938 --> 00:23:47.478
I don't know.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.961
No, that was an affirmative no.

00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:53.163
I'm not getting replaced, right?

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:54.044
And I said no.

00:23:54.124 --> 00:23:56.787
What did I say wrong, Ruffians?

00:23:56.807 --> 00:23:57.327
What did I say wrong?

00:23:57.347 --> 00:23:57.908
I said the proper answers.

00:23:57.928 --> 00:23:58.909
Yes, no.

00:23:58.949 --> 00:24:00.930
No, you said I'm not getting replaced, right?

00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:03.673
If I said yes, that means yes, you're getting replaced.

00:24:05.982 --> 00:24:07.865
I don't know if that's how it works, Moco-chan.

00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:09.367
Right!

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.312
Mococo is correct!

00:24:12.732 --> 00:24:13.093
Yes!

00:24:14.255 --> 00:24:14.736
Thank you!

00:24:16.238 --> 00:24:16.598
Thank you!

00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:22.467
Well, Ruffians, maybe later you can go and take a look at the photo.

00:24:23.108 --> 00:24:24.330
With your eyes!

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.093
And see how much cuter Moco-chan has gotten!

00:24:26.434 --> 00:24:29.959
Make sure your eyes are working just like after the Pero Sighting, huh?

00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:31.281
Yeah, and everything else.

00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:37.844
BAU BAU!

00:24:38.164 --> 00:24:39.526
You can't see the difference!

00:24:40.287 --> 00:24:44.393
You have to use your eyes better, okay?

00:24:45.034 --> 00:24:45.555
Got it?

00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:48.919
Got it, Moco-chan.

00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:51.463
BAU BAU!

00:24:53.485 --> 00:25:06.752
Ruffians, you know, I'm sure you realize, especially at the very beginning here, but the next episode of FUWAMOCO Morning is our 150th episode!

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:14.447
We're a very big milestone, and you know, we've had so many special mornings that we spent together.

00:25:14.427 --> 00:25:33.145
Ruffians, you ready?

00:25:34.154 --> 00:25:37.463
What does FUWAMOCO Morning mean to you?

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.118
We wanna hear mine from you, Ruffians!

00:25:44.983 --> 00:25:47.870
How does your morning routine go with FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.615
What does it mean to you?

00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:56.343
Like last time, but you know, it's been a little while, you know.

00:25:56.463 --> 00:25:59.547
It's important for us, okay?

00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:04.092
So, please let us know with the special hashtag.

00:26:04.292 --> 00:26:05.294
Special hashtag.

00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:06.094
Yes.

00:26:06.115 --> 00:26:09.599
Hashtag FWMCMORNING150.

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:10.980
150!

00:26:11.921 --> 00:26:13.143
Okay, Ruffians!

00:26:13.683 --> 00:26:17.328
But, as you know, maybe we can celebrate it all together.

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:19.230
Maybe...

00:26:19.565 --> 00:26:22.672
You know, share some of them as part of the celebration.

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:24.597
Yeah, please look forward to it, okay?

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:31.112
You know, being able to spend, you know, your morning together with us.

00:26:31.513 --> 00:26:35.262
It means a lot to us, but we want to share more.

00:26:36.237 --> 00:26:40.803
I wanna hear your stories, or maybe you know you had a really rough morning.

00:26:40.823 --> 00:26:46.110
Is it okay for us to be a bit selfish like this?

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.291
It's not morning there?

00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:49.033
That's okay!

00:26:49.094 --> 00:26:51.537
It's a good morning in your heart!

00:26:51.557 --> 00:26:55.442
Yeah, I wanna hear, what FUWAMOCO Morning means to you, Ruffians?

00:26:57.765 --> 00:26:59.507
So please let us know on Twitter with the hashtag, okay?

00:26:59.527 --> 00:27:00.388
It's right here.

00:27:01.415 --> 00:27:07.682
We're looking forward to it.

00:27:07.702 --> 00:27:09.664
Thank you all fans!

00:27:09.684 --> 00:27:09.844
BAU BAU!

00:27:11.006 --> 00:27:11.947
Moco-chan.

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:15.471
I think it's time for a very fluffy and fuzzy time of the day.

00:27:15.491 --> 00:27:15.591
Yeah!

00:27:16.412 --> 00:27:18.994
It's time for the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:21.417
Let's take a look at today's doggy.

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:23.980
De-den!

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.706
De-den!

00:27:26.726 --> 00:27:33.981
Today's Doggie of the Day is two doggies!

00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:34.743
Max and Luddy!

00:27:34.763 --> 00:27:35.003
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:27:35.023 --> 00:27:35.584
They're so silly!

00:27:35.604 --> 00:27:36.747
Look at them!

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:37.188
That was funny.

00:27:37.629 --> 00:27:40.635
Yeah, we do that sometimes too, huh Moco-chan?

00:27:40.615 --> 00:27:54.490
It's hard to tell which is the puppy with more levels.

00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:57.534
They both look so young.

00:27:57.574 --> 00:28:01.782
Silly Cuddle Puddle!

00:28:01.802 --> 00:28:02.643
But you know Max?

00:28:02.663 --> 00:28:05.488
Max is the kind, older puppy.

00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:06.550
And Woody!

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.838
Woody's still in training after, you know, some rough experiences.

00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:13.122
But it's nice of Max, you know?

00:28:13.923 --> 00:28:18.551
And you know, I'm sure Woody's doing great, you know?

00:28:19.513 --> 00:28:20.595
Max is busy, you know?

00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:22.297
FUWAMOCO in real life?

00:28:22.518 --> 00:28:23.219
No!

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:24.821
This is FUWAMOCO in real life!

00:28:25.502 --> 00:28:26.463
That's Max and Woody.

00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:32.873
Don't get cut off the Max and Woody channel, okay?

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:34.675
Got it.

00:28:34.976 --> 00:28:41.044
Moco-chan, how does Max BAU BAU?

00:28:41.064 --> 00:28:41.705
Wow!

00:28:42.606 --> 00:28:43.568
Wow!

00:28:43.768 --> 00:28:44.149
Wow!

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:44.389
Wow!

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.089
Wow!

00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:47.570
Wow!

00:28:48.912 --> 00:28:49.232
Cute!

00:28:49.252 --> 00:28:49.673
I like that.

00:28:49.893 --> 00:28:51.997
How does Woody BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:28:55.983 --> 00:28:58.947
Maybe Woody's not cooperating as much as we'd like?

00:28:59.708 --> 00:28:59.929
Yeah.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.992
A bit troublesome.

00:29:02.453 --> 00:29:03.294
A bit of wolf.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.798
You know.

00:29:05.838 --> 00:29:05.938
Yeah.

00:29:06.695 --> 00:29:08.738
That's okay, we'll get there.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.703
Still in training.

00:29:13.064 --> 00:29:21.735
But you know, I think just with one simple photo, we can clearly see that they're the best buddies you could ever wish for.

00:29:21.755 --> 00:29:23.938
Yeah, very silly buddies!

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:29.826
And I think also we can kind of see that maybe they are a bit of a handful at times.

00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:30.627
Maybe.

00:29:30.607 --> 00:29:37.854
FUWAMOCO Good luck!

00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:55.112
BAU BAU!

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.656
Sweet goggles, yeah!

00:30:00.417 --> 00:30:00.998
Wow, Ruffians!

00:30:01.018 --> 00:30:03.502
It's getting warmer and warmer.

00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:04.664
Almost at the end of April.

00:30:05.004 --> 00:30:06.707
You're going out for walks, right?

00:30:07.468 --> 00:30:11.053
Let's take a look on today I went on a walk.

00:30:11.114 --> 00:30:13.677
We have... De-den!

00:30:14.218 --> 00:30:15.620
Water!

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.822
Water!

00:30:16.842 --> 00:30:19.907
Oh my gosh, this is a photo of Sun Moon Lake.

00:30:20.247 --> 00:30:21.910
That's a cool name.

00:30:23.425 --> 00:30:26.630
Look at the water, it's so blue, green.

00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:27.872
Ticklies!

00:30:28.513 --> 00:30:29.375
Neat.

00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:29.675
Wow.

00:30:30.076 --> 00:30:32.860
Wow, this will be my paddle boarding.

00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:36.907
That's a lot of upper body strength.

00:30:36.987 --> 00:30:38.810
Yeah, you're brave.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.873
Oh, it's such a gorgeous picture and nice walk.

00:30:41.575 --> 00:30:43.137
Does this count as a walk?

00:30:43.157 --> 00:30:44.018
This is a paddle.

00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:47.063
A walk happened and then paddle.

00:30:47.204 --> 00:30:49.888
Today I went on a paddle boarding.

00:30:50.527 --> 00:30:52.650
Yes, that's yes, Moco-chan.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.170
Canoe.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.014
Is a paddleboard the same as a canoe?

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.055
I don't know.

00:30:57.095 --> 00:31:01.240
Well, FUWAMOCO you know.

00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:04.564
Well, we can't swim.

00:31:04.805 --> 00:31:06.627
These demon dogs, we can swim.

00:31:07.268 --> 00:31:11.613
But we're not too confident with our doggy paddle.

00:31:12.074 --> 00:31:14.857
Good enough.

00:31:14.877 --> 00:31:15.158
Yeah.

00:31:15.178 --> 00:31:15.538
Good enough.

00:31:16.683 --> 00:31:23.990
I hope you know there's a safety pride in case you know we kind of take a tumble off the sides there.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.953
Do I float well enough?

00:31:26.973 --> 00:31:30.016
Alright, well we'll figure that out if you get tossed in, huh?

00:31:32.899 --> 00:31:33.380
Please don't toss me in!

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.201
Do not toss me in, okay?

00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:38.505
What do you like more, the sun or the moon, Moco-chan?

00:31:40.967 --> 00:31:42.188
I think I like the moon.

00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:45.812
The moon is so pretty and it's not hot.

00:31:46.282 --> 00:31:50.169
The moon, it makes us feel magical.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:55.478
You know, it's something that kind of awakens a little bit.

00:31:55.618 --> 00:31:56.901
But the sun is nice too.

00:31:56.941 --> 00:31:58.503
The sun is nice, there's nothing wrong with the sun.

00:31:58.544 --> 00:31:59.585
I just like the moon better.

00:32:00.227 --> 00:32:00.527
That's all.

00:32:01.672 --> 00:32:04.497
BAU BAU!

00:32:04.517 --> 00:32:07.803
We hope you made it back to shore safely.

00:32:08.284 --> 00:32:11.189
BAU BAU!

00:32:11.209 --> 00:32:11.449
Thank you!

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.533
Thank you for taking us with you too.

00:32:14.575 --> 00:32:18.702
Please take us everywhere with you Ruffians, okay?

00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:23.319
Well, we also received a question from a Ruffian.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.843
Let's take a look at the Question of the Day.

00:32:26.004 --> 00:32:28.648
We have De-den!

00:32:30.351 --> 00:32:30.611
Hey FUWAMOCO!

00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:35.639
I'm heading to Japan in the near future and want to buy something as a souvenir.

00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:36.781
For yourself?

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.906
Maybe for friends, but maybe for yourself?

00:32:39.926 --> 00:32:45.996
If there's one hololive product or even something else that you can only get in Japan, what would you recommend?

00:32:46.536 --> 00:32:46.917
BAU BAU!

00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:51.744
We have no perfect answer for that, only in Japan.

00:32:51.985 --> 00:32:59.576
Well, in Tokyo Station, right now there's the hololive Tokyo Character Street store.

00:33:00.257 --> 00:33:07.268
There's a special Tokyo Character Street, a bunch of different stores within hololive.

00:33:08.024 --> 00:33:28.598
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:28.578 --> 00:33:30.160
Spread things soon!

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.101
That is true too!

00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:32.563
It might be soon!

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:34.305
I guess in the near future.

00:33:34.325 --> 00:33:35.787
I don't know how near that is.

00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:41.914
But also you know, maybe you're planning a trip to Akihabara.

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:46.019
We recommend going and visiting the Kotobukiya store!

00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:48.241
There's a big hololive section!

00:33:48.742 --> 00:33:53.307
And you know, you might be able to find something very special there as well!

00:33:53.327 --> 00:33:54.028
And maybe FUWAMOCO

00:33:54.008 --> 00:34:00.033
We'll be there at the register there to bring up your purchase.

00:34:00.334 --> 00:34:06.339
We're so happy to be able to help out with the register at the Kotobukiyo.

00:34:06.359 --> 00:34:06.940
In our special outfits too.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:16.829
But you know we have heard from Ruffians that it is a little tricky to find FUWAMOCO merch in Japan in the wild sometimes.

00:34:20.312 --> 00:34:20.692
Good luck looking!

00:34:20.712 --> 00:34:20.832
Sorry!

00:34:20.852 --> 00:34:21.933
BAU BAU!

00:34:21.953 --> 00:34:22.173
Have fun!

00:34:22.674 --> 00:34:22.834
BAU BAU!

00:34:23.658 --> 00:34:29.046
Thank you so much, Muffians, for all your submissions!

00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:29.267
Thank you!

00:34:29.647 --> 00:34:35.937
You know, we're always looking for more Doggie of the Day's Pero Sightings questions and looks.

00:34:35.957 --> 00:34:44.029
And you can send them to us with the hashtag, the usual hashtag #FWMCMORNING, but... Oh, I get that!

00:34:44.009 --> 00:34:56.684
Because for our next special episode of episode 150 of FUWAMOCO Morning, we'd like you to share with us what FUWAMOCO Morning means to you with the hashtag.

00:34:56.884 --> 00:34:58.646
Hashtag FWMCMORNING150!

00:34:58.746 --> 00:35:01.209
150, okay?

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.110
Got it!

00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:02.851
Yeah.

00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:03.973
Just this one.

00:35:04.073 --> 00:35:06.336
You can post right after this, yeah.

00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:09.219
It's always good to do it before you forget.

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:09.359
Yeah.

00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:10.480
Or you could do it down below.

00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:10.881
Yeah.

00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:11.822
Before you forget.

00:35:12.325 --> 00:35:19.045
Thank you so much for being here!

00:35:19.065 --> 00:35:19.366
BAU BAU!

00:35:20.028 --> 00:35:22.676
Do we have another stream coming up, Moco-chan?

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:26.166
My next stream is on...

00:35:28.137 --> 00:35:29.840
De-den!

00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:34.768
FUWAMOCO Morning episode 1 debut!

00:35:35.169 --> 00:35:42.341
FUWAMOCO is actually going to be going on our first mini vacation since debut.

00:35:42.722 --> 00:35:46.248
So we're going to be going off and exploring Japan a little bit.

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:53.520
And we'll be back with FUWAMOCO Morning on April 28th.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.902
A bunch of stories!

00:35:55.563 --> 00:35:59.587
Maybe some photos and some recommendations too on places to visit!

00:36:00.148 --> 00:36:02.271
So, we'll do our best!

00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:02.952
We'll have lots of fun!

00:36:03.532 --> 00:36:04.173
Okay!

00:36:05.234 --> 00:36:07.938
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:08.558
We'll look forward to it!

00:36:08.578 --> 00:36:12.243
Of course, we'll also be in Kyary-senpai's channel content as well!

00:36:12.944 --> 00:36:16.188
I hope that you'll check that out too!

00:36:16.388 --> 00:36:20.192
And hopefully we can also do a Twitter space during your time as well!

00:36:20.273 --> 00:36:21.855
Hope for good wifi.

00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:22.275
Yeah.

00:36:22.762 --> 00:36:25.028
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:25.048 --> 00:36:33.912
And for the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... It's BAU BAU traveling!

00:36:34.594 --> 00:36:37.783
BAU BAU!

00:36:37.763 --> 00:36:42.832
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning today!

00:36:43.894 --> 00:36:50.065
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:50.987

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:27.846
To every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:37:28.687 --> 00:37:31.111
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
