05:49.256 --> 05:53.399
Extra silly today, you think?

05:53.459 --> 05:54.320
Oh, Ruffians.

05:54.400 --> 06:02.086
If only you knew how silly it is today!

06:02.126 --> 06:06.389
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us for

06:07.318 --> 06:10.161
The start of your week, another FUWAMOCO Morning app!

06:10.441 --> 06:12.983
The start of your summer maybe!

06:13.023 --> 06:14.264

06:14.745 --> 06:14.264
104!

06:14.805 --> 06:17.948

06:18.168 --> 06:21.811
Ruffians will be joining us today for the very first time!

06:21.891 --> 06:27.657
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:27.677 --> 06:29.178
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

06:29.458 --> 06:30.760
It's hosted by us!

06:31.340 --> 06:32.901

06:32.921 --> 06:39.245
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:39.425 --> 06:45.248
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:45.528 --> 06:49.190
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:49.670 --> 06:51.712
BAU BAU!

06:56.885 --> 06:59.266
This is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:59.346 --> 07:01.708
BAU BAU!

07:01.728 --> 07:05.269
Hopefully it'll be a wonderful start to your day!

07:05.289 --> 07:08.151
Get you right started on the right paw.

07:08.311 --> 07:09.231
It's 11am for you!

07:09.692 --> 07:11.012
The start of your morning!

07:12.353 --> 07:13.293
It's still the start.

07:14.154 --> 07:14.354
Yeah!

07:16.075 --> 07:21.297
I'm excited to see what, you know, this week holds, what this summer holds for us Ruffians!

07:21.317 --> 07:22.077
A new month.

07:22.537 --> 07:24.158
Yeah!

07:24.198 --> 07:24.658
Lightning.

07:24.678 --> 07:28.700
Well, uh, the next bit is a bit frightening too.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.262
It's Friday night, but... It's summertime, you know summer's supposed to be fun!

07:35.703 --> 07:36.603
Ice cream!

07:37.424 --> 07:37.604
No.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.464
Water, no?

07:38.644 --> 07:39.945
No, nothing like that.

07:39.965 --> 07:40.725
We had another...

07:41.504 --> 07:42.605
Pero Sighting.

07:42.725 --> 07:43.965
Pero Sighting.

07:44.706 --> 07:48.447
No Bikini Pero, that would be terrifying, Ruffians!

07:48.547 --> 07:50.588
Well, let's take a look!

07:51.589 --> 07:54.630
De-den!

07:54.650 --> 08:01.253
I don't think this is a Bikini Pero, but we're not too sure.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.935
Would it be better if it was Bikini Pero?

08:05.476 --> 08:10.499
You are really brave to try out and get through Friday night of Fridays.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.121
Did you get through all the nights though?

08:13.301 --> 08:14.682
Every single one!

08:14.922 --> 08:17.845
It looks like there's something extra nasty there though.

08:18.385 --> 08:18.965
Yeah.

08:19.065 --> 08:19.426
Pero.

08:19.446 --> 08:20.547
Pero.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.268
You won't leave is your game.

08:25.450 --> 08:29.134
You know, we were seeing a bunch of crazy things we were playing.

08:29.254 --> 08:32.857
You know, Golden Freddy?

08:32.957 --> 08:34.439
I don't know, we saw a lot of stuff.

08:34.719 --> 08:36.921
Yeah, we got killed by nothing too.

08:37.802 --> 08:38.582
I don't know.

08:38.642 --> 08:39.463
Not fair!

08:39.483 --> 08:43.106
Yeah, well, maybe that's...

08:44.040 --> 08:46.662
Extra lucky or maybe extra unlucky.

08:46.822 --> 08:49.784
Extra nasty, that's for sure.

08:50.005 --> 08:51.646
Extra nasty peron.

08:52.827 --> 08:56.570
We hope that you were able to get through all his nastiness.

08:56.650 --> 08:58.551
It can be a bit much.

08:59.552 --> 09:02.774
You know, maybe a pudding for him can help things a bit.

09:02.794 --> 09:03.495
Or for you.

09:07.498 --> 09:09.680
But good job being brave!

09:10.721 --> 09:12.202
BAU BAU!

09:12.222 --> 09:15.424
FUWAMOCO, we're pretty brave, right?

09:15.845 --> 09:17.926
Oh, he's making the game better!

09:17.947 --> 09:20.709
That's an interesting take on things.

09:21.229 --> 09:23.871
I don't know if I agree with that one, but okay!

09:23.911 --> 09:28.675
Ruffians just want to make every game fluffy and fuzzy and a little bit nasty, I guess.

09:29.256 --> 09:30.597
Is that what you like, Ruffians?

09:32.498 --> 09:34.380
Fluffy, fuzzy, and nasty, huh?

09:34.540 --> 09:35.742
We need that game!

09:36.723 --> 09:36.943
No.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.528
BAU BAU!

09:42.188 --> 09:44.571
Yeah, it makes it extra terrifying.

09:44.591 --> 09:46.172
I guess it's true.

09:47.438 --> 09:47.759
Yeah.

09:47.819 --> 09:48.640
It's not wrong.

09:48.900 --> 09:49.241
Yeah.

09:50.782 --> 09:54.927
Speaking of terrifying, terrifying in a terrific sense.

09:54.947 --> 09:56.609
I always get confused about that.

09:56.649 --> 09:57.270
Terrifying.

09:57.470 --> 10:03.057
Oh, that's terrific, but then terrific, terrifying, but terrific, good terrifying.

10:03.077 --> 10:04.439
I wonder why, huh?

10:05.667 --> 10:06.348
I get confused.

10:06.828 --> 10:07.990
Ruffians!

10:08.670 --> 10:16.499
The tickets for hololive English's second concert, Breaking Dimensions, went on sale last week!

10:16.740 --> 10:18.782
How did you do it?

10:19.022 --> 10:21.165
It was quite the battle for the tickets.

10:21.782 --> 10:23.003
Terrifyingly.

10:23.483 --> 10:24.804
You got yours!

10:25.264 --> 10:25.784
You did!

10:25.804 --> 10:28.746
Yeah, it sold out so quickly!

10:29.206 --> 10:30.387
It was a blood bath!

10:30.427 --> 10:36.190
There were tens of thousands trying to get their paws on only a few tickets high!

10:36.390 --> 10:37.350
You got one!

10:37.451 --> 10:37.851
BAU BAU!

10:39.031 --> 10:43.214
Congratulations to the extremely lucky ones who got the venue tickets.

10:43.675 --> 10:52.801
But for those who didn't, we hope that you'll be cheering us on the Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy way through online streaming tickets with SPW and Spawn.

10:53.001 --> 10:53.381
Right!

10:53.521 --> 10:56.163
And you can get them right now too, Ruffians!

10:56.203 --> 10:57.724
You don't need to worry.

10:57.764 --> 11:00.106
No more battling, you know.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.007
Don't forget!

11:01.107 --> 11:02.187
So you have to get it now.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.287
That way you don't forget!

11:05.307 --> 11:07.229
The Northwest Passage is very far!

11:07.389 --> 11:08.730
It's not easy, okay?

11:21.610 --> 11:23.533
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

11:37.010 --> 11:41.291
That Ruffian will be cheering for us as loudly as you can!

11:41.351 --> 11:44.872
Dancing around and jumping along too!

11:44.892 --> 11:51.573
You know when you're at the venue, or you have a watch party with friends, or you're joining us on the other side of the computer screen.

11:51.593 --> 11:54.454
Please make sure that you BAU BAU lots, okay?

11:54.554 --> 11:56.034
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:56.094 --> 11:56.495
FUWAMOCO!

11:56.535 --> 11:58.315
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:58.415 --> 12:00.015
Breaking dimensions!

12:00.115 --> 12:01.416
Like that, okay?

12:01.556 --> 12:02.856
That's what I want to hear, okay?

12:04.176 --> 12:04.997
You promise?

12:05.257 --> 12:05.657
Yeah.

12:05.917 --> 12:06.757
Gotta forget.

12:07.157 --> 12:11.080
FUWAMOCO's first stage performance!

12:30.123 --> 12:32.044
Wow.

12:32.104 --> 12:37.005
You know, I think it goes without saying, but we're gonna bring our best.

12:37.865 --> 12:39.826
The performance of all days.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.166
Oh, our performance!

12:41.186 --> 12:42.306
I'm fuzzing this one.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.346
Oi, Moco-chan.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.327
We will settle for less.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.827
BAU BAU!

12:46.887 --> 12:49.968
We're excited!

12:50.108 --> 12:51.469
Yeah, BAU BAU!

12:51.489 --> 12:51.769
BAU BAU!

12:51.809 --> 12:52.049
Yeah!

12:57.218 --> 13:01.581
Well, Ruffians, we sure you heard the big news.

13:02.262 --> 13:11.449
But, over the weekend, the beloved, beloved, very beloved, friend A, she announced... A-chan!

13:11.509 --> 13:19.075
Yeah, A-chan, she announced her retirement and that she would be spending her last day at hololive at the end of last month.

13:19.855 --> 13:22.818
Yeah, otsukaresama desu.

13:23.829 --> 13:32.317
Right, it was really bittersweet to say goodbye to her after a very, very special seven years here at hololive.

13:33.237 --> 13:34.679
Right, Moco-chan?

13:34.699 --> 13:38.022
Moco-chan, you're getting teary.

13:40.975 --> 13:45.619
FUWAMOCO will miss her so so much.

13:58.670 --> 14:04.874
She was really lovely and welcoming to us as the new demon dogs on the corner!

14:04.894 --> 14:08.337
I wanted to spend more time together.

14:08.437 --> 14:11.038
There's never enough time, right?

14:11.659 --> 14:21.886
Yeah, but we'll treasure the times and the conversations that we had together with her and all the wonderful things that she told us, reassured us with.

14:23.916 --> 14:28.980
We're wishing each and all the best for the next step at FUWAMOCO!

14:29.060 --> 14:29.961
Moco-chan, right?

14:30.442 --> 14:34.385
We're gonna be the strongest twin demon boy band ever, right?

14:34.405 --> 14:35.626
Strong!

14:35.987 --> 14:37.088
Not crying!

14:37.228 --> 14:37.748
No!

14:38.129 --> 14:39.069
No, right?

14:39.089 --> 14:41.471
My cheeks are not wet, though!

14:41.512 --> 14:44.935
Yeah, she had an amazing impact, right?

14:45.715 --> 14:52.260
Yeah, but you know FUWAMOCO will be strong and that way we can make her really proud, right?

14:52.300 --> 14:53.121
We'll make you proud!

14:53.141 --> 14:53.861
Thank you so much, Ii-chan!

14:53.882 --> 14:54.322
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:54.362 --> 14:54.942
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:54.962 --> 14:55.723
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:55.743 --> 14:56.123
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:56.143 --> 14:56.604
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:56.684 --> 14:57.124
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:57.144 --> 14:57.484
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:57.504 --> 14:57.945
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:57.965 --> 14:58.585
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:58.605 --> 14:59.186
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:59.306 --> 14:59.746
Thank you, Ii-chan!

14:59.766 --> 15:00.286
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:00.306 --> 15:00.687
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:00.707 --> 15:01.047
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:01.067 --> 15:01.407
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:01.447 --> 15:01.968
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:02.008 --> 15:02.408
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:02.428 --> 15:02.828
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:02.848 --> 15:03.189
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:03.209 --> 15:03.549
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:03.569 --> 15:04.129
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:04.149 --> 15:04.590
Thank you, Ii-chan!

15:04.610 --> 15:04.890
Thank you, Ii-

15:06.093 --> 15:07.375
FUWAMOCO Morning!

15:19.488 --> 15:20.609
Lots of good memories.

15:20.829 --> 15:22.190
Let's cheer her on!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.812
Let's keep the memories in our heart, okay?

15:25.673 --> 15:28.075
BAU BAU!

15:30.577 --> 15:32.418
Legend is forever, forever, forever!

15:37.702 --> 15:39.744
Today is the first day of July.

15:39.804 --> 15:40.825
First day of July.

15:40.845 --> 15:44.529
Somehow, July and August are officially summer.

15:44.589 --> 15:45.189
Right, Ruffians?

15:45.289 --> 15:46.410
It's officially summer.

15:46.450 --> 15:47.972
You agree with us, right?

15:48.732 --> 15:50.214
It's officially summer.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.495
Summer has started.

15:52.699 --> 15:53.679
Summer, summer!

15:53.699 --> 15:55.320
Do you think it's summer?

15:55.340 --> 15:56.901
Yes, yes, yes, yes, summer!

15:56.961 --> 15:59.482
When it's cold and it's hot, it's summer.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.002
When it's gonna be summer, it's summer.

16:01.022 --> 16:01.843
July is summer.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.083
August is summer.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.664
Can't disagree with it.

16:06.324 --> 16:10.946
Well, you think of summer, Ruffians, you know, ice cream is a big one.

16:11.006 --> 16:11.906
Ice cream is good.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.547
Ah, sunscreen because the sun is really strong.

16:14.567 --> 16:15.308
Important!

16:15.608 --> 16:15.888
Yes!

16:16.628 --> 16:19.372
It's also fun in the water.

16:19.573 --> 16:20.194
Water?

16:20.534 --> 16:31.250
Right, you might have seen Ruffians, but hololive is having a collaboration with a water park and us, FUWAMOCO, we're participating in it!

16:31.430 --> 16:33.711
The Liyue Village Rotten Pie.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.093
You know what this means, right?

16:36.113 --> 16:38.414
Too many pies!

16:38.454 --> 16:39.294
Look at all of us.

16:39.334 --> 16:42.816
I need to scroll because there's so much of us.

16:43.056 --> 16:52.722
You know we have Ayame-senpai, Mari-sencho-senpai, Nenechi, Muna-senpai, Kubo-senpai.

16:52.922 --> 16:54.563
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:54.603 --> 16:55.183
Who's next?

16:55.977 --> 16:56.977
Inose-pon.

16:57.037 --> 16:59.818
The cute, the cute, the bond.

16:59.838 --> 17:00.058
Grassy pond.

17:00.178 --> 17:00.958
FUWAMOCO!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.058
FUWAMOCO!

17:03.818 --> 17:05.379
FUWAMOCO!

17:05.399 --> 17:06.059
FUWAMOCO!

17:06.119 --> 17:07.699
FUWAMOCO!

17:07.859 --> 17:08.259
FUWAMOCO!

17:08.339 --> 17:08.939
FUWAMOCO!

17:08.979 --> 17:09.319
FUWAMOCO!

17:09.339 --> 17:09.559
FUWAMOCO!

17:09.639 --> 17:10.000
FUWAMOCO!

17:10.040 --> 17:10.640
FUWAMOCO!

17:10.700 --> 17:11.260
FUWAMOCO!

17:11.480 --> 17:11.740
FUWAMOCO!

17:11.800 --> 17:12.440
FUWAMOCO!

17:12.460 --> 17:12.720
FUWAMOCO!

17:12.760 --> 17:13.780
FUWAMOCO!

17:13.800 --> 17:14.220
FUWAMOCO!

17:14.300 --> 17:14.960
FUWAMOCO!

17:15.020 --> 17:15.681
FUWAMOCO!

17:15.701 --> 17:16.141
FUWAMOCO!

17:16.161 --> 17:17.381
FUWAMOCO!

17:17.401 --> 17:17.961
FUWAMOCO!

17:18.001 --> 17:18.621
FUWAMOCO!

17:19.341 --> 17:20.201
FUWAMOCO!

17:20.281 --> 17:20.961
FUWAMOCO!

17:20.981 --> 17:21.842
FUWAMOCO!

17:21.882 --> 17:22.262
FUWAMOCO!

17:22.422 --> 17:22.702
FUWAMOCO!

17:22.742 --> 17:23.322
FUWAMOCO!

17:23.342 --> 17:23.362
F

17:24.442 --> 17:26.264
Why do I see Ina-senpai?

17:26.604 --> 17:28.586
Ina-senpai's pretty cute though.

17:31.488 --> 17:36.752
Moco-chan, don't get jealous!

17:37.093 --> 17:50.824
Tickets for the Leofu Village Water Park go on sale on July 5th at 12pm, but there'll be also a lot of special photo areas and other special things hiding around the park.

17:52.379 --> 17:56.963
Special voice messages from us that you can only hear there too!

17:57.263 --> 17:58.264
Of course!

17:58.504 --> 17:58.925
Of course?

17:59.205 --> 18:02.848
There'll be special merchandise and special food!

18:02.948 --> 18:06.571
And special life slides and more!

18:06.671 --> 18:13.597
And we'll also be entitled to the fish travel water slides, so please come ride it with us, okay?

18:13.637 --> 18:14.658
I'm so excited!

18:14.718 --> 18:16.279
Everything is special, okay?

18:18.060 --> 18:18.581
Yeah!

18:18.701 --> 18:21.343
Especially because it's swimsuits.

18:21.463 --> 18:22.664
Right, Ruffians?

18:22.704 --> 18:23.345
FUWAMOCO.

18:23.385 --> 18:23.545
Yeah!

18:23.785 --> 18:26.107
FUWAMOCO swimsuits!

18:26.307 --> 18:29.790
Do you think Muna-senpai would switch swimsuits with me?

18:30.030 --> 18:30.771
What do you mean?

18:30.891 --> 18:31.371
Me?

18:31.812 --> 18:33.733
No, you would fit that, Moco-chan.

18:34.153 --> 18:35.575
What?!

18:36.175 --> 18:37.076
Ruffians.

18:37.096 --> 18:39.278
Yeah!

18:39.318 --> 18:40.378
Ruffians!

18:42.380 --> 18:42.901
With this.

18:44.829 --> 18:47.970
I can't say that Mococo isn't sexy, right?

18:50.011 --> 18:50.411
Right?

18:52.112 --> 18:54.673
Right?

18:56.533 --> 18:56.813
Look!

18:57.354 --> 19:00.355
You have little floaties there, Moco-chan.

19:00.975 --> 19:02.315
Are you sure?

19:02.355 --> 19:03.516
It's time for this again!

19:03.536 --> 19:04.556
They're not floaties!

19:04.596 --> 19:06.497
Look at them closely, okay?

19:07.777 --> 19:09.078
The proof is right there!

19:11.662 --> 19:16.643
Ruffians, definitely go check it out if you want to see our best doggy paddle too!

19:16.723 --> 19:16.963
BAU BAU!

19:16.983 --> 19:20.884
I think you look good doggy paddle, okay?

19:21.505 --> 19:21.785
Yeah.

19:22.525 --> 19:24.745
But, is the doggy paddle sexy?

19:28.346 --> 19:29.867
Is a doggy paddle ever sexy?

19:34.757 --> 19:35.477
That's up to you.

19:35.537 --> 19:36.377
We'll think about it.

19:36.937 --> 19:39.838
BAU BAU!

19:39.858 --> 19:41.558
BAU BAU!

19:42.018 --> 19:44.059
There's so many exciting things going on.

19:44.099 --> 19:47.120
This is the water park you have to go to.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.060
Wow!

19:49.520 --> 19:56.041
Also, Ruffians, you know, our new kouhai Justice just debuted.

19:56.481 --> 19:58.702
And actually, we got

20:00.189 --> 20:01.850
FUWAMOCO School!

20:02.050 --> 20:03.531
BAU BAU!

20:03.792 --> 20:05.132
Let's check it out!

20:05.333 --> 20:06.673
Thank you, Ruffians!

20:06.713 --> 20:07.954
Thank you so much!

20:08.014 --> 20:08.655
Thank you!

20:08.715 --> 20:11.897
I live for the impeccable journalism!

20:12.437 --> 20:12.838
Yes!

20:12.998 --> 20:19.222
Yes, in Elizabeth and her very first Archive Karaoke stream, she did well.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.783
She sung Advent's original song, Rebellion.

20:22.863 --> 20:27.025
In case you didn't know it, which I was very happy to hear.

20:27.405 --> 20:31.747
But I have to admit, when I woke up, she was already done.

20:31.847 --> 20:33.807
So then I checked out the archive.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.488
I was like, oh, Rebellion!

20:35.948 --> 20:36.849
And I clicked it.

20:37.129 --> 20:37.809
The timestamp.

20:37.829 --> 20:40.790
Thank you timestamp, Ruffians.

20:41.550 --> 20:45.852
And I was very surprised because this is how I woke up.

20:46.819 --> 20:47.540
Ruffians!

20:47.980 --> 20:50.502
Elizabeth is a monster!

20:50.942 --> 20:55.805
She shocked the entire enchilada to rebellion in one breath!

20:58.507 --> 20:59.888
Try it right now, okay?

20:59.928 --> 21:00.589
Ruffians!

21:01.469 --> 21:05.232
A, D, V, E, M, T. Time to get this party started.

21:05.292 --> 21:08.935
Fire, fire, light the fire brighter, higher as you desire.

21:09.115 --> 21:09.175
Ow!

21:17.085 --> 21:17.525
I can't.

21:17.965 --> 21:18.466
I can't.

21:18.566 --> 21:19.246
Ruffians.

21:19.266 --> 21:20.507
We're a bit tired too.

21:20.527 --> 21:21.568
Yeah, we're a bit.

21:21.768 --> 21:24.050
You know, it's the end of the day.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.292
We're very tired too.

21:26.712 --> 21:28.113
Yeah, is it even possible?

21:28.133 --> 21:29.354
You try, Ruffians.

21:29.694 --> 21:31.455
You give it your best shot.

21:31.495 --> 21:34.698
You sing it as beautiful as Elizabeth, which would be something.

21:35.518 --> 21:37.080
And you do it in one breath, okay?

21:38.660 --> 21:39.600
It's just not possible.

21:39.620 --> 21:42.741
But it is if you're a monster like Elizabeth.

21:42.821 --> 21:43.421
Monster.

21:43.981 --> 21:45.062
And that's how I woke up.

21:45.122 --> 21:47.862
Fuwawa was like, Moco-chan, listen!

21:47.902 --> 21:52.123
She's a monster!

21:52.483 --> 21:58.105
She just took the entire beginning to her ability in one breath.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.225
I was like, hi.

21:59.585 --> 22:00.125
Yeah.

22:00.885 --> 22:01.286
Hi.

22:01.706 --> 22:03.346
We're demon dogs, Moco-chan.

22:03.366 --> 22:04.566
We have to do the same.

22:04.586 --> 22:04.666
Okay.

22:05.667 --> 22:06.067
Doggy paddle.

22:08.305 --> 22:13.006
Lots of doggy paddling and then we can sing Rebellion in one breath.

22:13.026 --> 22:13.946
The entire song.

22:15.647 --> 22:16.747
Take that, Elizabeth.

22:16.807 --> 22:17.367
Entire song.

22:17.387 --> 22:18.167
That's the goal, okay?

22:18.207 --> 22:18.508
BAU BAU!

22:18.528 --> 22:26.790
Good luck with all the karaoke, Elizabeth!

22:26.910 --> 22:28.210
BAU BAU!

22:28.350 --> 22:32.831
Big ones, very big ones.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.652
We have to do some more doggy paddling.

22:34.672 --> 22:35.692
It's a bit hard, huh?

22:36.752 --> 22:39.433
Yeah.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.394
Wow, Ruffians!

22:41.714 --> 22:42.554
It's one day.

22:43.114 --> 22:47.936
It's been a little while, but it's the time of the week, Ruffians!

22:48.457 --> 22:56.460
You know, a new FUWAMOCO Morning, a new week, and a new challenge!

22:56.860 --> 23:00.521
Moco-chan's Natto Challenge!

23:01.001 --> 23:02.602
Is what I want to say.

23:03.959 --> 23:19.263
But Ruffians, after the 100th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning and many many displays of braveness, Moco-chan's natto challenge is coming to a close today.

23:20.703 --> 23:21.264
I win!

23:21.284 --> 23:24.344
Moco-chan, your thoughts?

23:24.945 --> 23:25.645
I win!

23:25.665 --> 23:28.286
I don't know Ruffians.

23:28.386 --> 23:29.886
I think I've grown quite a lot.

23:31.090 --> 23:32.010
I've grown a kinda lot.

23:32.310 --> 23:33.631
I've grown a kinda lot.

23:35.471 --> 23:36.372
Before I couldn't.

23:36.992 --> 23:40.053
Just the smell was enough to not be good.

23:41.493 --> 23:43.054
And now I can sort of eat them.

23:43.654 --> 23:44.734
She can sort of eat them.

23:44.754 --> 23:47.115
Do you agree with this statement, Ruffians?

23:50.737 --> 23:52.138
How about a pizza challenge?

23:52.559 --> 23:55.561
PIZZA CHALLENGE AFTER MIDNIGHT RuffianS!

23:55.581 --> 23:57.743
What are you trying to do, Hai?

23:57.763 --> 23:59.464
I don't know.

23:59.724 --> 24:07.711
Yeah, but Moco-chan, you know, I do agree that eating natto at midnight, right before bed, is a little bit difficult.

24:07.731 --> 24:13.676
Ruffians, it's too difficult for me to eat natto right before bed.

24:14.056 --> 24:14.537
My tummy...

24:15.477 --> 24:15.718
No.

24:16.098 --> 24:16.599
Yeah.

24:16.979 --> 24:20.602
But Moco-chan, you promised that you'll make it as homework, right?

24:20.983 --> 24:24.846
You'll give Ruffians regular updates on how the natto eating is going.

24:24.866 --> 24:24.926
Yes.

24:29.210 --> 24:30.492
She said yes, right?

24:31.292 --> 24:31.633
Right!

24:32.958 --> 24:35.480
Midnight Pizza Challenge!

24:36.321 --> 24:38.363
I don't know, what about last time?

24:39.143 --> 24:42.046
That's hard on a midnight Tommy too.

24:42.146 --> 24:43.227
I don't know, Ruffians.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.889
Ask Mei-senpai to do that, okay?

24:46.770 --> 24:47.650
Not me!

24:47.670 --> 24:51.974
Okay.

24:52.154 --> 24:56.778
Wow, Moco-chan, do you mess with your homework with the Ruffians regularly?

24:56.798 --> 24:59.200
How are you and Nanatoi getting along?

24:59.981 --> 25:00.221
Yes.

25:01.153 --> 25:03.354
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:23.845 --> 25:26.066
Every single day we're challenging ourselves.

25:26.086 --> 25:29.169
Who could say every single day is a challenge?

25:29.689 --> 25:31.571
That's a different meaning, darling!

25:31.591 --> 25:34.133
BAU BAU!

25:35.213 --> 25:42.319
Again, thank you so much to all the farmers for their delicious natto.

25:42.719 --> 25:47.083
And Ruffians, we hope that you try it someday too, okay?

25:47.483 --> 25:49.605
BAU BAU!

25:52.944 --> 25:55.547
You said goodbye to the natto.

25:55.727 --> 25:59.432
But let's say hello to our Doggie of the Day today!

25:59.812 --> 26:03.337
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

26:03.377 --> 26:05.540
We have... De-den!

26:06.220 --> 26:07.342
Anyo!

26:07.802 --> 26:08.203
Hi!

26:08.563 --> 26:10.725
I'm just having some nice dreams, hi!

26:10.845 --> 26:17.530
Chiyuki, you know, I know Senpai's really cute, but this Anya here... So cute!

26:17.710 --> 26:19.392
A bit sleepy, huh?

26:19.452 --> 26:22.314
I'm just gonna fall asleep on my big booty.

26:22.374 --> 26:23.315
I'm sleepy.

26:24.155 --> 26:26.637
This looks like a good pillow.

26:27.198 --> 26:27.878
I think so.

26:27.938 --> 26:30.801
You know, when you're tired, anything's a good pillow, right?

26:30.941 --> 26:32.302
I'm gonna take a nap now.

26:32.362 --> 26:35.384
Yeah, just like a hard bone can be a good pillow too.

26:35.404 --> 26:35.945
Good pillow.

26:36.465 --> 26:38.646
Doesn't matter if you're sleepy.

26:39.367 --> 26:40.668
You're sleepy.

26:40.828 --> 26:43.749
How do you think I'm about BAU, Moco-chan?

26:55.214 --> 27:06.363
I can tell for sure that Anya is having some very sweet dreams of delicious bones.

27:06.704 --> 27:13.149
And hopefully, you know, once maybe this pillow disappears, maybe there'll be more pillows.

27:13.169 --> 27:14.610
More pillows in the future!

27:14.650 --> 27:16.652
Hopefully not the ones with feathers.

27:17.312 --> 27:18.773
Bone pillows.

27:19.354 --> 27:20.235
Bone pillows.

27:20.915 --> 27:21.856
BAU BAU!

27:24.483 --> 27:26.885
And next, Ruffians, you know it's the summer time.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.748
It is perfect to go outside right now as long as you remember your sunscreen.

27:30.768 --> 27:31.749
It's not too hot outside.

27:31.769 --> 27:35.772
So let's take a look on the little adventures you've been going on.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.914
Let's take a look.

27:38.234 --> 27:38.535
De-den!

27:42.917 --> 27:44.058
A tree!

27:44.358 --> 27:49.599
This tree looks like a knee joint!

27:49.619 --> 27:50.279
That's what it does!

27:50.339 --> 27:52.680
It's like an elbow.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.820
What's the difference between a knee and an elbow?

27:56.180 --> 27:56.781
Arm bend.

27:57.021 --> 27:57.941
Knee bend.

27:58.381 --> 27:58.941
Leg bend.

27:59.081 --> 27:59.401
Arm bend.

27:59.421 --> 27:59.861
Knee bend.

28:00.141 --> 28:01.362
Oh, arm bend, leg bend?

28:04.072 --> 28:04.854
Ruffians!

28:05.354 --> 28:06.937
Do your knees look like this?

28:07.057 --> 28:09.141
All barky and wassy.

28:09.161 --> 28:10.322
I should hope not.

28:10.342 --> 28:11.785
It looks like a tree.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.059
Yeah!

28:17.619 --> 28:18.400
Yeah!

28:18.540 --> 28:23.604
We gotta rub some moisturizer on the barky like that.

28:23.724 --> 28:24.325
Yeah.

28:24.345 --> 28:25.426
Stop the barking.

28:26.467 --> 28:28.729
I'm gonna pull off the moss too.

28:29.609 --> 28:34.414
FUWAMOCO-chan, you're ready, right?

28:34.434 --> 28:36.115
I'll pull off the moss!

A math question?

Yeah.

29:55.058 --> 29:56.438
We did, okay?

There are so many memories at arcades.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.782
