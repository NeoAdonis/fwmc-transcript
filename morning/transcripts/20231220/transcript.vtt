00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:14.356
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:18.299
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.062
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.143
BAU BAU!

00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:28.066
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:30.768
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:33.010
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:40.213
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:44.094
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 59th episode!

00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:45.615
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:50.697
Ruffians, are you awake?

00:05:51.257 --> 00:05:51.577
What?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.970
Really?

00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.132
It's been a little bit of a rough 24 hours, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:05:57.752 --> 00:06:00.894
But thank you, Ruffians, for joining us!

00:06:01.254 --> 00:06:04.355
Maybe there's some first-time Ruffians out there, too.

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:12.919
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show that will be Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.500
Monday!

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.440
Monday!

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:20.001
It's not Monday today, Moco-chan.

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:22.822
Today, it's Wednesday!

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:24.243
Yeah.

00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:25.923
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.304
Is also known as FUWAMOCO.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:29.564
Yeah.

00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:32.345
FUWAMOCO Morning is hosted by us!

00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:34.686
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.846
Say FUWAMOCO again!

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:37.887
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:39.007
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:58.334
I aim is to bring a smile to your face.

00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:02.256
I hope you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:06.259
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.822
It's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:13.962
BAU BAU!

00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:15.003
BAU BAU!

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.403
BAU BAU!

00:07:16.423 --> 00:07:16.863
BAU BAU!

00:07:16.883 --> 00:07:18.544
Don't mock me, okay?

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:19.584
I won't mock you.

00:07:19.604 --> 00:07:23.746
It's my duty as a little sister, right, Ruffians?

00:07:25.387 --> 00:07:26.447
I have the right to mock.

00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:27.768
I don't think so.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.709
Uh-huh.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:31.449
Well!

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.931
The Ruffians, apparently, they saw Pero again.

00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:37.792
Again?

00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:38.372
Really?

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.391
Where is he this time, hoi?

00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.572
Well, let's see.

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:47.834
De-den!

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.555
Ruffians, look!

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:53.177
Pero has a new part-time job.

00:07:53.777 --> 00:08:03.563
This time, he's doing the heartless work of being a Santa who has numerous kids sit on his lap and listen to what kind of toys and presents they want for Christmas.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:12.180
Ruffians, do you want to take a photo on Pero Santa's lap?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.303
Do you want to take a photo with Pero Santa?

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:20.407
What do you think it'll feel like?

00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:24.010
I'm just curious, you know, would it be squishy?

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.392
Would it make a sound?

00:08:25.892 --> 00:08:28.254
But he's a muscle.

00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:32.058
It could still be squishy.

00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:33.188
Hmm.

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.289
Well, you do!

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:36.110
What?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.270
What legs?

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.231
He looks jolly?

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.791
I usually don't mean jelly.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:43.373
I think Pero, you know, does he need legs?

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:44.033
What?

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:45.054
Does he need legs?

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.331
He has wings, those are like skylights.

00:08:49.732 --> 00:09:01.118
Yeah, well, you know, Pero-san said he did bring us and the other Advent girls some gifts for Christmas, but he would never bring us what we wanted.

00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:09.902
You know, sometimes it was a bit disappointing to be honest.

00:09:10.694 --> 00:09:14.277
We're just happy to receive something, right?

00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:18.900
Because he probably tried his best.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.521
Ruffians!

00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:23.743
Do you know what you're asking for for Christmas?

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:26.065
Do you?

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:26.625
Do you?

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:28.667
It's very important.

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:34.371
You know, you better get ready before Moco Santa comes to town.

00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:35.852
Okay, I'll get ready.

00:09:36.857 --> 00:09:39.478
Good health, that's a good one.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:44.819
Steak and wine, not a bar of soap, are you sure?

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.879
Well, Muffins, you better get thinking, okay?

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:51.400
There's not much time, not much more time!

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.820
BAU BAU!

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:56.361
BAU BAU!

00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:58.701
Well, that's an interesting job, huh?

00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:01.422
It'd be fun, maybe.

00:10:01.442 --> 00:10:03.542
Yeah, I think so, Moco-chan.

00:10:05.023 --> 00:10:06.043
You wouldn't want to do that.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.611
I don't know.

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.712
It's tough being a Santa, huh?

00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:12.952
Well!

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:16.254
We have some exciting news!

00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:17.534
Ruffians!

00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:26.178
Tonight, we have the very first in a double upload of cover solo songs!

00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:27.278
Tonight!

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:35.499
We released our cover of Shiro's Cute no Kanojo back in October, right?

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:39.501
But I think Ruffians liked it quite a bit, right?

00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:40.942
Maybe.

00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:42.203
Just maybe.

00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:44.504
Thank you for all the feedback!

00:10:44.564 --> 00:10:46.045
We love you, Ruffians!

00:10:46.806 --> 00:10:55.851
But tonight, at 6pm PT, we'll be releasing a FUWAMOCO solo version, followed by a FUWAMOCO!

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.629
Followed by me, Mococo!

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.631
A Moco-chan version at the same time tomorrow, you know?

00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:15.113
And then you'll be able to listen to both of them very closely and get a good feel for the differences in our voices and, you know, our creative expressions, too.

00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:20.814
You know, sometimes it can be a bit tricky for some Ruffians, so maybe this will be a helpful guide in a sense.

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:22.695
But you know...

00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:30.940
I'm so curious to see whose cover will be more popular.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.082
Get listening, Ruffians!

00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:34.622
BAU BAU!

00:11:34.742 --> 00:11:35.603
Exciting!

00:11:36.264 --> 00:11:38.225
Exciting!

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.887
Well, also exciting is...

00:11:47.762 --> 00:11:48.862
The homework we gave you.

00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.124
That's right, Moco-chan.

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:52.744
We gave homework.

00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:53.765
We gave homework.

00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:55.165
Ruffians!

00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:56.566
Did you finish it yet?

00:11:58.226 --> 00:12:02.728
We mentioned it last FUWAMOCO Morning, but we need your help again.

00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:08.991
You know, on Monday, we asked you to share your favorite holiday or Christmas memory with us, right?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.292
You remember, right?

00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:11.892
Right!

00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:12.712
Yeah!

00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:15.194
No forgetting.

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:16.115
No forgetting.

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:19.477
Yeah, we wanted to learn a little bit more about you.

00:12:19.777 --> 00:12:24.941
And so we're hoping that you'll share some of your memories with us and the Ruffians too.

00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:26.262
You can't finish it?

00:12:27.603 --> 00:12:31.345
I think you mean I can finish it.

00:12:31.846 --> 00:12:33.607
Yeah, you are.

00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:37.570
Well, we opened up a Google Form for you to fill in.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.611
There's only a few simple rules.

00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.252
Only a couple.

00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:40.852
BAU BAU!

00:12:58.709 --> 00:12:59.029
I see hope.

00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:01.811
I see hope that you haven't forgotten your memories.

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:31.367
It might be hard to get to them all, but... But!

00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:40.112
You have until Saturday, December 21st at 6pm PT to submit yours, okay?

00:13:41.573 --> 00:13:45.195
That part is slow because it's very, very important, okay?

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:46.275
Yeah.

00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:48.236
And Moco-chan, where can you find that?

00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:53.359
You can find the link right underneath us in... In my tag!

00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:53.959
Right...

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.241
Right underneath us!

00:13:57.841 --> 00:13:59.901
In the description box, okay?

00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.362
There's a link there.

00:14:01.582 --> 00:14:01.902
Okay.

00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:03.182
And also on Twitter too, right?

00:14:03.222 --> 00:14:03.822
And Twitter, yeah.

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:04.123
Yeah.

00:14:04.263 --> 00:14:07.303
So you better get writing, Ruffians!

00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:08.024
Go at it!

00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:12.625
Actually, maybe Ruffians, do you have any good ideas right now?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.746
Good ideas for memories to share, maybe?

00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:18.487
Maybe that will make some other Ruffians... Oh!

00:14:18.547 --> 00:14:19.187
Where was that?

00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:21.947
Don't share other Ruffians' memories.

00:14:22.007 --> 00:14:23.448
Not really, ha!

00:14:26.092 --> 00:14:26.693
You do?

00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:28.775
Oh, you're gonna keep it a secret, though?

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:30.897
You have to turn your ears down.

00:14:31.378 --> 00:14:32.299
That's okay, that's okay.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.761
Nice to meet you.

00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:35.383
Oh no, spoilers!

00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:36.344
Are you secret?

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:41.621
I'm not sure they're interesting enough though.

00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.003
I'm sure your memories are interesting, okay?

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:46.284
I'm sure they are.

00:14:47.004 --> 00:14:48.425
Who got a dog for Christmas?

00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:52.828
Like, you got a new family member?

00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:57.451
One of my favorites is drinking hot chocolate with my kitty!

00:14:59.893 --> 00:15:03.296
We wanna hear those memories, okay?

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:06.880
Please submit them, okay Ruffians?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.201
Those are all great.

00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:14.667
We're looking forward to the cozy time hearing all about those memories and moments, okay?

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:15.288
BAU BAU!

00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:30.683
Well, you know, almost as soon as it becomes the new year, there is the big hololive New Year Card!

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:34.726
The big Mario Card Tournament!

00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:35.727
You know what?

00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:39.829
This year, it'll be taking place on the 7th and the 8th!

00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:40.349
Yeah!

00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:45.171
And you know, us, FUWAMOCO, will be participating in it for the first time, of course!

00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:45.452
Yeah.

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:51.014
And unlike the Minecraft Sports Day Tournament back in November, if you remember.

00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:51.934
I remember.

00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:55.476
This time, we're participating separately!

00:15:55.556 --> 00:16:00.058
And you know, we're separated into separate teams, because that's what happens when you participate separately.

00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:00.558
Yeah.

00:16:00.618 --> 00:16:01.159
Moco-chan, Abyss,

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:07.621
I was gonna ask if we could share what groups we were put into, but... It's BAU.

00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:10.162
Wow, Ruffians!

00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:12.583
Moco-chan is in the Able!

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:16.044
And myself, Fuwawa, I'm in the D.Va!

00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:19.105
What do you think of the team's hall, Ruffians?

00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:21.526
Good placement.

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.307
Is it suited for us?

00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:25.748
Do you think we have a chance to win?

00:16:27.182 --> 00:16:28.362
D-D is scary.

00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:32.644
Fuwawa, D, Mococo, A, that is the block placement.

00:16:32.664 --> 00:16:32.904
Yeah.

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:34.444
Sorted by random.

00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:35.705
Random.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:36.205
Yeah.

00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:38.486
Towa-senpai is random.

00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:41.066
Okai-senpai on the wheel.

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:45.068
Sorted by Okai-senpai and Towa-senpai randomly.

00:16:45.528 --> 00:16:47.148
Yeah.

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:48.529
Just what?

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:50.049
Just like what?

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:50.629
What's that?

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:51.930
What's that?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.270
D group is chaotic.

00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:54.991
Hmm.

00:16:58.058 --> 00:17:00.280
Regardless, we're going to do our best.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.544
But we do have a lot of practicing to get through before so that we can catch up to our senpai.

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.206
They've been many years, right?

00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:09.946
Yeah.

00:17:10.207 --> 00:17:11.908
You know, we'll do our best still.

00:17:12.268 --> 00:17:13.889
But one thing is for sure!

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.712
Is that we're going to have the most fun!

00:17:17.772 --> 00:17:21.595
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:17:21.755 --> 00:17:22.475
That's for sure.

00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:23.816
I'm looking forward to it.

00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.017
It's going to be fun, okay?

00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:25.597
Yeah.

00:17:28.271 --> 00:17:39.256
Well, Ruffians, it's not just my yukkuri that's coming up, but you know, the end of the year is almost here.

00:17:39.276 --> 00:17:41.497
Do you know what that means?

00:17:41.517 --> 00:17:44.178
I'm curious.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:45.419
Do you know?

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:49.181
There's something that FUWAMOCO is really excited about.

00:17:52.383 --> 00:17:55.066
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:17:55.206 --> 00:17:55.686
BAU BAU!

00:17:55.706 --> 00:17:58.989
It's time for <i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:18:09.486 --> 00:18:11.667
Well, maybe you should pay attention.

00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:12.627
That Ruffian!

00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:13.827
That Ruffian!

00:18:14.007 --> 00:18:16.148
Don't touch the morning air!

00:18:17.008 --> 00:18:18.248
I'm sorry Ruffian, I touched you.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.449
She's chasing the Ruffian with her finger.

00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:22.629
That Ruffian!

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.269
Stop.

00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:25.950
At the end of the year.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.530
It's Winter Comic Market!

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.451
And you know what?

00:18:30.491 --> 00:18:30.931
This year.

00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:34.629
Well, Moco-chan, what is comics?

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:46.054
Okay, well, to explain first, so, in case you don't know, Comic Market is Japan's biggest fan comic convention where they sell doujinshi and other fan-made indie works, you know?

00:18:46.094 --> 00:18:47.415
So it's not just comics.

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:55.138
It could be things like music or merchandise or even just, you know, written works about what kind of gyoza they like or their own homemade recipes.

00:18:55.198 --> 00:18:56.259
It could be anything, okay?

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:59.040
And in the industry, there's also an industry, everyone.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.320
I guess they'll be official.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.201
Hold on!

00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:02.942
Yeah, it's super fun.

00:19:02.962 --> 00:19:05.102
Very free.

00:19:07.964 --> 00:19:09.905
You know, there's, of course, cosplay too.

00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:11.145
Lots of stuff going on.

00:19:11.165 --> 00:19:13.666
You really, really don't know what you might discover.

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:16.207
Endless possibilities.

00:19:16.227 --> 00:19:17.768
We love Comiket.

00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:29.493
But, FUWAMOCO, us, Mococo, we're going to be making our Comiket debut at Icomochi-mama, so cool!

00:19:33.683 --> 00:19:34.644
Moco-chan, what's a circle?

00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:37.967
You know, a circle is like a... Circle's a shape.

00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:40.489
Yeah, it is a shape.

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:44.712
But, you know, it's what you call a comic group.

00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:45.993
But yeah!

00:19:46.073 --> 00:19:47.074
Icomochi-mama!

00:19:47.314 --> 00:19:49.996
She's releasing an unofficial FUWAMOCO fanbook set!

00:19:50.196 --> 00:19:52.678
And we're really excited!

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:54.839
You know, look at the cute blanket too.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:04.511
You know, we've also been seeing some other very creative Ruffians getting ready for their own FUWAMOCO related books and comic book day.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.192
So we can't wait!

00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:10.935
Creative Ruffians.

00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:13.816
You're gonna send us a copy too, right?

00:20:16.018 --> 00:20:16.358
Right.

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:18.760
Right?

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:18.980
Right!

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:19.960
Of course, right!

00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:26.565
You know, like we said in our debut, we want to get our paws off FUWAMOCO!

00:20:26.605 --> 00:20:26.805
Yeah!

00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:29.009
We said that!

00:20:29.069 --> 00:20:29.790
Yeah, but...

00:20:38.015 --> 00:20:42.699
But you know, we're still looking forward to seeing all the Ruffian spoils of war done.

00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:43.340
Yeah!

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.562
Because Comiket is mine!

00:20:46.843 --> 00:20:47.924
BAU BAU!

00:20:48.384 --> 00:20:49.345
BAU BAU!

00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:51.307
Have fun!

00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:52.688
Exciting!

00:20:52.728 --> 00:20:53.629
Very very exciting.

00:20:53.689 --> 00:20:54.990
Comiket is so fun.

00:20:56.969 --> 00:20:58.930
It's chaos, it's war, but it's fun.

00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:02.373
Very fun.

00:21:02.673 --> 00:21:06.556
You know it's also, it's not the end of the year, it's kind of close to the end of the year.

00:21:06.596 --> 00:21:07.917
It's the holiday season.

00:21:08.237 --> 00:21:13.260
So Ruffians, naturally, you've been eating a lot of chocolate recently.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.001
Naturally!

00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:14.421
Right?

00:21:15.102 --> 00:21:20.886
Not FUWAMOCO though, no chocolate for us, but... What about chocolate wafers?

00:21:21.486 --> 00:21:23.047
Have you been having any of those?

00:21:25.009 --> 00:21:25.269
No!

00:21:26.306 --> 00:21:32.152
Now, well, maybe it's time that you should.

00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:49.068
Because Ruffians, starting in April, you'll be able to find us, Advent, and a bunch of our senpai packed together as cards along almost any kind of candy place.

00:21:50.826 --> 00:21:54.489
Do you think you'll be able to find us?

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:56.150
Yeah.

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.382
FUWAMOCO is here!

00:22:11.402 --> 00:22:13.183
FUWAMOCO is here!

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.265
Candy for FUWAMOCO!

00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:19.427
We're gonna be in accord with the candy.

00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:21.008
We won't become the candy.

00:22:21.068 --> 00:22:24.691
But we're really looking forward to it!

00:22:24.951 --> 00:22:27.032
Try your best to get FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.582
You know, I... You might have to get a lot of wafers first, huh?

00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:36.363
Yeah, you might have to eat them.

00:22:36.403 --> 00:22:41.126
Yeah, but... I hope you like wafers!

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.567
They're delicious!

00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:44.168
That's April.

00:22:44.588 --> 00:22:44.968
April.

00:22:45.428 --> 00:22:47.729
You still have some time to move to Japan!

00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:49.750
You still have time, okay?

00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:50.511
Yeah, you know... April.

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:52.470
Ohikoshi wa mada.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.131
Ari desu.

00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:57.573
BAU BAU!

00:22:57.593 --> 00:23:00.515
Oh, I'm excited for those.

00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:01.616
Chocolate.

00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:09.461
But we don't know what flavor it's gonna be though, so... There's so many possibilities.

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:12.582
I bet it, Ruffians, it's gonna be your favorite flavor.

00:23:12.623 --> 00:23:13.043
For sure.

00:23:13.063 --> 00:23:16.245
For sure.

00:23:16.945 --> 00:23:18.146
Exciting.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:27.310
It's been exciting.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:37.337
It's been good, but... Ruffians... I kinda did... I did something.

00:23:37.757 --> 00:23:38.257
I did it.

00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:38.958
He did.

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:42.941
I messed up.

00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:47.904
There's been... Another misunderstanding.

00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:50.746
There goes our combo.

00:23:55.162 --> 00:24:03.031
Do you ever say something that's, like, wrong, but you think, well, everyone understands, so it's fine, right?

00:24:03.211 --> 00:24:06.094
And then you continue to say that all the time?

00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:09.097
That happens to us a lot.

00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:10.699
Yeah, just a bit.

00:24:10.819 --> 00:24:11.600
Yeah, well...

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:23.674
Ah, that's why, you know, I described our sneezes as having different flavors the other day while we were reading Super Chats after playing Chillin's Art.

00:24:24.094 --> 00:24:24.916
Snooze game!

00:24:25.116 --> 00:24:25.937
Jishatsu!

00:24:26.558 --> 00:24:27.138
You know, because...

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:28.359
Ichibou.

00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:31.221
Sneezes have different flavors to them.

00:24:31.601 --> 00:24:34.663
Yeah, like personality, you know, personality.

00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:35.644
Personality.

00:24:35.664 --> 00:24:37.785
Not like an actual taste.

00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:38.265
No.

00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:40.186
No, of course, of course not.

00:24:40.506 --> 00:24:41.987
That's gross, Ruffians.

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:42.728
Very, very gross.

00:24:42.828 --> 00:24:45.689
Yeah, and it's not like you can taste the flavor when you sneeze.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.570
I'm hot.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:47.751
Right, Moco-chan?

00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:50.112
I don't know.

00:24:50.732 --> 00:24:52.573
I feel like I can smell more.

00:24:52.593 --> 00:24:54.194
Uwabi sneeze.

00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:54.995
What?

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:55.255
Uwabi.

00:25:01.427 --> 00:25:04.589
I mean, I feel like after sneezing I can smell more.

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:07.231
I don't know if that counts though.

00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:08.672
That doesn't count, no.

00:25:10.453 --> 00:25:12.395
Ruffians, you understand me, right?

00:25:12.415 --> 00:25:15.297
There's a personality in every sneeze.

00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:17.098
That makes sense, right?

00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:18.039
Not flavor, though.

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:18.940
Just personality.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.102
Each of our sneezes have a different personality to them.

00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:24.364
Yeah, like a spicy sneeze.

00:25:24.644 --> 00:25:26.726
But that's a flavor, though.

00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:31.129
I'm just confusing the Ruffians more, aren't I?

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.471
Ruffians, you understand, right?

00:25:33.491 --> 00:25:36.593
We're trying to clear up the misunderstanding, not make more.

00:25:36.613 --> 00:25:38.655
You understand, right?

00:25:39.175 --> 00:25:39.776
Understood?

00:25:41.354 --> 00:25:42.014
Understood.

00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:45.396
Do they understand?

00:25:45.416 --> 00:25:49.378
Just smile and say understood.

00:25:50.538 --> 00:25:51.719
Understood!

00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:54.440
BAU BAU!

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.481
I'm glad the Ruffians are so understanding.

00:25:57.802 --> 00:25:59.522
Right?

00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:01.063
Me too.

00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:03.204
Wow, Ruffians.

00:26:03.584 --> 00:26:06.245
How are you feeling about this week so far?

00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:09.087
Has it been a little rough maybe?

00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:11.309
How's it?

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.851
I wouldn't know anything about that.

00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:18.032
No, not at all, huh?

00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:19.112
Uh-uh.

00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:26.135
Well, Moco-chan, maybe the Ruffians could use a little extra popping and stuff.

00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:33.497
Well... Ruffians!

00:26:35.278 --> 00:26:37.239
Can you get a bit closer?

00:26:39.568 --> 00:26:42.550
You know, there's something I wanna say!

00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:44.372
You know what this is, right?

00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:48.055
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:26:48.555 --> 00:26:52.018
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:53.399
Ruffians!

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.704
You know, sometimes it can be rough, right?

00:26:59.798 --> 00:27:03.340
No matter how hard you try, things just don't go your way.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.280
You know?

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.222
No matter how much you prepare, your plans get a wrench thrown in them.

00:27:10.683 --> 00:27:18.246
Sometimes, you really can't prepare and expect what's gonna happen the next day no matter how hard you try to be ready for the unexpected.

00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:20.887
And you know, that's okay!

00:27:21.428 --> 00:27:23.608
Because that's just how life is!

00:27:25.089 --> 00:27:26.710
But, you know what?

00:27:28.137 --> 00:27:30.359
You have a secret trick to you!

00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:32.140
You're resilient!

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.381
You're super strong!

00:27:34.942 --> 00:27:40.466
Despite how you feel sometimes, when things get rough, you actually get tougher!

00:27:41.266 --> 00:27:42.847
Don't you think that's amazing?

00:27:43.768 --> 00:27:52.194
So, no matter how difficult and frustrating things can be at this busy time of year, don't worry, don't sweat the small stuff, and you know what?

00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:54.155
You'll be okay.

00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:57.798
Even if you don't have everything under control,

00:27:58.496 --> 00:28:00.518
You do have some things under control.

00:28:01.578 --> 00:28:02.379
And that's good enough.

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:03.140
Okay!

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:10.025
You know, it sounds kind of silly, but let's enjoy the punches that life sends our way to, okay?

00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:12.126
You can do it, Ruffians!

00:28:12.687 --> 00:28:13.948
You can do it!

00:28:14.428 --> 00:28:16.069
Ganbaite ne!

00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:18.111
BAU BAU!

00:28:18.971 --> 00:28:21.573
BAU BAU!

00:28:23.114 --> 00:28:24.976
You can do it, Ruffians!

00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:30.097
BAU BAU!

00:28:30.598 --> 00:28:31.439
And next!

00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:35.242
We're gonna have a Doggie of the Day!

00:28:35.262 --> 00:28:37.644
Moco-chan, who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:28:37.964 --> 00:28:40.666
We have... De-den!

00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:42.528
We have Kobe!

00:28:42.588 --> 00:28:45.811
Kobe is the Doggie of the Day!

00:28:46.952 --> 00:28:48.393
This isn't this Ruffian's dog.

00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:53.057
No, this is this Ruffian's friend's dog.

00:28:55.114 --> 00:28:55.414
Yeah!

00:28:55.535 --> 00:28:57.877
I guess that's acceptable, but... What do you mean?

00:28:58.057 --> 00:29:01.520
He didn't say your Doggie of the Day, just our Doggie of the Day.

00:29:02.201 --> 00:29:09.068
You know, Kobe is extra special because apparently he's a model for a vulgar... or dog?

00:29:09.568 --> 00:29:09.968
Dog?

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.889
Yeah.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.951
Are you sure about that?

00:29:13.936 --> 00:29:16.637
You know, he kinda looks like he's made of cardboard.

00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:18.978
Cardboard?

00:29:19.438 --> 00:29:24.281
Well, you know, it's good to have lots of different doggies of all kinds, you know?

00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:25.781
Especially cardboard ones.

00:29:26.201 --> 00:29:28.182
Yeah, it adds flavor!

00:29:28.302 --> 00:29:29.003
Flavor?

00:29:29.443 --> 00:29:31.464
Not personality?

00:29:31.584 --> 00:29:32.224
Flavor!

00:29:33.144 --> 00:29:36.246
Very cute.

00:29:36.526 --> 00:29:38.107
How does Kobe BAU BAU?

00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:41.608
You know Kobe works for a dog store?

00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:43.329
Maybe like...

00:29:44.414 --> 00:29:45.556
Like that!

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:46.077
Like that!

00:29:57.526 --> 00:30:00.627
I don't know what this BAU BAU is, but sure, it can be Kobe's.

00:30:03.008 --> 00:30:03.328
Kobe!

00:30:04.048 --> 00:30:07.009
Kobe is ambitious.

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:11.290
He will show that he's cut out for the modeling industry.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.611
Cut out of cardboard.

00:30:14.371 --> 00:30:15.712
He's so cut out for it.

00:30:16.192 --> 00:30:18.353
He even looks a little bit like a cutout.

00:30:18.513 --> 00:30:19.134
Why?

00:30:19.394 --> 00:30:20.474
Yeah, and you know what?

00:30:20.975 --> 00:30:23.676
He's doing an amazing job.

00:30:24.516 --> 00:30:26.958
BAU BAU!

00:30:27.518 --> 00:30:28.658
Very cute cardboard.

00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:29.919
Good boy.

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:31.740
Right?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.781
Good boy.

00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:34.181
BAU BAU!

00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:39.984
And next for today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:42.646
What?

00:30:42.846 --> 00:30:43.927
Oh my goodness!

00:30:44.648 --> 00:30:45.689
This is beautiful!

00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:47.310
It's so colorful!

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.331
This is downtown Mexico City!

00:30:49.352 --> 00:30:52.854
Did you buy anything there?

00:30:52.874 --> 00:31:08.067
You know, I don't know, it might be a bit silly, but you know, I actually really love looking at the lights at night, you know, so this illumination, I really like it a lot.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.914
It looks like it was a lot of fun!

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:15.999
Thank you for sharing it with us!

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.642
BAU BAU!

00:31:18.764 --> 00:31:22.007
Ah, next time we got a question from a Ruffian.

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:25.369
My Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.830
Good morning!

00:31:26.931 --> 00:31:28.111
Good morning!

00:31:28.131 --> 00:31:30.353
I'm always looking forward for the pup talk.

00:31:30.593 --> 00:31:34.076
It gives me real power for an entire week.

00:31:34.296 --> 00:31:35.597
I have a question.

00:31:35.697 --> 00:31:39.340
Has FUWAMOCO's hair always had this length ratio?

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.583
Or has Mococo had it longer than Fuwawa's at some point?

00:31:43.043 --> 00:31:43.744
BAU BAU!

00:31:44.084 --> 00:31:45.225
BAU BAU!

00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:46.626
This is another good question.

00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:48.067
It's a good question.

00:31:48.487 --> 00:31:55.391
Well, actually, at one point, when we were really little demon dogs, it was me.

00:31:56.271 --> 00:31:57.232
I had long hair.

00:31:58.292 --> 00:32:00.854
And I had short hair.

00:32:01.174 --> 00:32:02.394
So it is strange, right?

00:32:02.815 --> 00:32:04.536
Are you surprised, Ruffians?

00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:08.318
But, you know, we much, much prefer it like this.

00:32:08.538 --> 00:32:09.978
It works best like this, right?

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:13.981
We're the cutest now, just as we are right, Ruffians?

00:32:16.437 --> 00:32:16.958
Right!

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.582
What's with the sock, Emily?

00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:20.083
Huh?

00:32:21.144 --> 00:32:21.785
Huh?

00:32:23.588 --> 00:32:23.808
Yes!

00:32:23.928 --> 00:32:24.029
Yes!

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.340
Yeah!

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.480
Right answer.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.661
BAU BAU!

00:32:31.761 --> 00:32:39.263
Thank you so much for all your submissions and for being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning along with us, Ruffians!

00:32:39.723 --> 00:32:40.343
Thank you!

00:32:40.503 --> 00:32:43.064
We're always looking for more Doggie of the Day!

00:32:43.264 --> 00:32:45.044
For questions, questions, questions, questions.

00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:47.144
I'm sure you have lots of questions.

00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:49.025
For more walks, you know.

00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:54.186
And especially the brand new FUWAMOCO scoop as well under the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:32:55.288 --> 00:32:58.072
Thank you so much for always supporting us, Ruffians!

00:32:58.112 --> 00:32:58.633
BAU BAU!

00:33:00.936 --> 00:33:02.418
And next!

00:33:02.478 --> 00:33:06.381
Well, what we have upcoming next isn't a stream, but!

00:33:06.962 --> 00:33:07.262
But!

00:33:08.263 --> 00:33:09.444
We have!

00:33:09.725 --> 00:33:18.453
Tonight at 6pm PT 11am JST, we're gonna be premiering our solo covers of Kyuuto no Kano-chan!

00:33:18.493 --> 00:33:20.175
Today and tomorrow!

00:33:20.255 --> 00:33:22.897
You know, so today is me, tomorrow is Moco-chan.

00:33:23.138 --> 00:33:23.838
And then!

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:31.446
On Friday we'll be back bright and early with you for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:35.491
It'll be a little bit of a wait, but we'll see you again soon, okay?

00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:36.672
We'll be around, okay?

00:33:36.992 --> 00:33:37.853
We will.

00:33:38.193 --> 00:33:40.095
BAU BAU!

00:33:40.316 --> 00:33:42.918
And if we take another peek at our schedule...

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.430
Busy Ruffians.

00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.093
Well you know, Christmas is just about here.

00:33:51.473 --> 00:33:55.096
And this weekend we have a lot of plans on Saturday.

00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:57.899
Moco Santa's coming to town.

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:02.082
At FUWAMOCO we're gonna be going to Malaysia for Carnival Fiesta.

00:34:02.362 --> 00:34:06.846
And then we're gonna be playing Among Us together with Alphard and our Ian-senpai.

00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:10.109
And then, Sunday is Christmas Eve.

00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:12.271
And we have some big plans with you!

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:16.354
So, we hope that you'll be able to spend a little bit of time with us.

00:34:16.394 --> 00:34:17.254
Don't miss it, okay?

00:34:17.274 --> 00:34:18.776
Even if it's just a little bit.

00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:19.676
Okay.

00:34:20.137 --> 00:34:21.318
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:22.018

Thank you so much for joining us, Ruffians.

00:34:29.064 --> 00:34:31.726
And thank you for also being so understanding.

00:34:32.006 --> 00:34:35.409
We had to make a couple of changes to our schedule yesterday.

00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:37.831
We really appreciate it.

00:34:37.871 --> 00:34:39.472
Moco-chan.

00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:41.154
I'm feeling a little bit better.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.571
It's because of you, Ruffians.

00:34:43.591 --> 00:34:44.071
Thank you.

00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:44.972
Thank you.

00:34:44.992 --> 00:34:52.616
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
