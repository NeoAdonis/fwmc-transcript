<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:40.132
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.558
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.145

00:05:00.657 --> 00:05:01.017
Wait, Ruffians!

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.940
Do you ever join in?

00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:06.582
You know what?

00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:08.464
Join us for the opening!

00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:09.025
Huh?

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.887
You fall back asleep.

00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:13.969
Say it word by word.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.770
Huh?

00:05:15.323 --> 00:05:25.974
Well, Ruffians, today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:25.994 --> 00:05:28.656
In case you didn't hear 5 seconds ago, yes!

00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:31.599
Thank you for joining us for our 158th episode.

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.464
Déjà vu!

00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:37.846
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:41.249
I'm feeling a little more fluffy than usual today.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.132

Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:17.813
BAU BAU!

00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:19.895
Are you first time?

00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:20.636
That's you then!

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:22.979
That's the information for you then!

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.742
Did Fuwawa see what episode it is today?

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:28.125
I did, Moco-chan!

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:30.878
You said we're your hosts, but I don't know.

00:06:30.898 --> 00:06:32.863
Do you know what episode it is, Ruffians?

00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:35.309
What episode is it, Ruffians?

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.529
She did!

00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.432
She did!

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:37.133
She did it!

00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:39.118
I did!

00:06:39.138 --> 00:06:41.183
You weren't listening, Ruffians!

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:45.393
She kinda, she kinda sped through it.

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:46.536
Ha!

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:52.810
FUWAMOCO That'll say it again!

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.053
Thank you Ruffians for joining us!

00:06:55.073 --> 00:06:57.176
Wait, wait, wait, we have to go back, okay?

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:57.917
We have to go back.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.902
Once again, once again.

00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:03.103
What is this?

00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:06.107
What is this?

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:11.014
Thank you for joining us for our 128th episode!

00:07:11.094 --> 00:07:12.356
I said it though, Moco-chan.

00:07:13.217 --> 00:07:14.639
Say it clearly.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.282
FUWAMOCO

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:24.962
Hi!

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:26.408
Ruffians!

00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:28.135
Today is a bit different, huh?

00:07:28.155 --> 00:07:30.183
We're starting today off on the right paw!

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:31.508
That is a bit different!

00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:35.340
Well, you know, it's a new week.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.788
New things happen in a new week, and today is another example of that.

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:43.775
This time, the Ruffians sent us something different!

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:44.777
Different?

00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:46.901
Something new for the new week?

00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:47.161
Yeah.

00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:52.110
You know, I just wanted to send something to start off the week happy, right?

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.114
So I... Happy!

00:07:54.134 --> 00:07:54.795
No Pero Sighting.

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:58.471
It's just... A sighting!

00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.712
Ignore it, ignore it.

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:00.873
A sighting!

00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:03.555
I'm feeling confused right now, but... A sighting!

00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:04.596
Ignore the text.

00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:05.457
Okay.

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:06.498
Let's take a look.

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:08.600
What did you want to show us, Ruffians?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.524
We have... De-den!

00:08:12.544 --> 00:08:13.125
Breakfast?

00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:15.006
Breakfast.

00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:17.989
Pero... But breakfast!

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:19.951
I like breakfast!

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:22.554
Breakfast is good, Ruffians!

00:08:22.574 --> 00:08:22.694
No!

00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:23.955
This breakfast is...

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.748
Maybe not the most balanced vitamins wise, but you know, it's a breakfast for the heart!

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:32.092
Breakfast is important!

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.176
Ruffians, you have a breakfast, right?

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:37.682
But, there's a question here, you know.

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:39.164
Ruffians.

00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:42.450
Breakfast ni suru?

00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:45.094
Milk tea ni suru?

00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:47.378
Soretomo?

00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:49.219
The Great Perroccino.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.743
I think it's an easy decision, right?

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:53.525
You don't.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.288
I can't Pero.

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.091
We'll have the milk tea.

00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:59.975
Yeah, you can have the breakfast, okay?

00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:03.680
And then you know what will make you something even more vitamin happy?

00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:04.542
Vitamin healthy?

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:05.543
Vitamin healthy, yes.

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:06.685
Tomorrow.

00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:09.769
Green tea smoothie.

00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:11.492
Green tea smoothie.

00:09:11.472 --> 00:09:12.713
Green smoothie.

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:15.496
Well, it's green tea and my green smoothie.

00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:16.617
It's just green breakfast.

00:09:17.437 --> 00:09:18.478
It's vitamin happy.

00:09:19.339 --> 00:09:23.983
You know, next time you're like, today I'm gonna have a very vitamin happy meal.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.485
You know, oh look at this apple.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:27.226
It's very vitamin happy.

00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:30.850
That's how you can use it from now on, Ruffians.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.212
Yeah, pero not very vitamin happy.

00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:35.114
Pero burrito.

00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:38.897
It does look very comfy, but from a perroccino to...

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.015
He's a whole breakfast of caribbeans.

00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:50.081
I'll have something else.

00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:50.301
Yeah.

00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:52.544
Will you play the burrito?

00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:54.286
Yeah.

00:09:54.306 --> 00:09:54.907
No thank you.

00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:01.916
You know, he just kind of took the tray and accidentally pushed it forward.

00:10:02.878 --> 00:10:03.999
Probably rolled away.

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.302
Off the balcony there.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.006
Then the seagulls could have him!

00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:12.329
Everybody's happy!

00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:18.743
BAU BAU!

00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:22.110
There's a lot of exciting things happening over the weekend!

00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:24.375
And one of them!

00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:24.815
Wow.

00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:26.737
Kaori-senpai!

00:10:26.757 --> 00:10:30.060
And she has a brand new song called Die For You.

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:32.562
It's composed by Yuki Tsujimura.

00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:37.887
And lyrics is also by Yuki Tsujimura and Kaori-senpai!

00:10:37.907 --> 00:10:38.728
Of course.

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:42.792
And the song is kind of to die for.

00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:44.974
Moco-chan, were you waiting to say that?

00:10:44.994 --> 00:10:45.174
I was.

00:10:45.234 --> 00:10:46.055
I was waiting.

00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:49.338
But the music video is very cool.

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.040
There's lots of different ways to interpret it.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.042
Maybe that's because there's

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.392
Interpretive dancing?

00:10:55.412 --> 00:10:56.834
Contemporary dancing?

00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:59.117
Contemporary and interpretive dancing?

00:10:59.798 --> 00:11:04.786
I like the part where Calli-senpai's face is like... At the beginning there.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.692
But it's a very interesting music video.

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:11.176
Definitely a song that you have to listen closely to.

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:18.247
I don't know if you've been paying attention, but Calli-senpai keeps on outdoing herself every single new release of hers.

00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:19.008
I don't know!

00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:20.991
She blows us away every time!

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.910
I can't believe it.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.712
Her singing is so good!

00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:26.914
Every time, you know.

00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:30.339
Every song is so different vocally and tone and expression.

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:33.763
I love everything that she puts into her music.

00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:37.228
Please check it out here!

00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:42.655
There's also subtitles in English, Japanese, and in Korean this time.

00:11:42.675 --> 00:11:44.037
So you'll have to check it out.

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:49.725
Pay attention to the lyrics too.

00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:49.905
BAU BAU!

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:50.566
Congratulations on the new song!

00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:51.147
We can't wait to have fun!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.129
Die for you.

00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:58.899
I just love the expression that's in her voice so much.

00:11:58.919 --> 00:11:59.179
BAU BAU!

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.273
I don't know, I love this illustration.

00:12:18.393 --> 00:12:20.336
It looks like a little storybook game.

00:12:20.376 --> 00:12:24.263
Maybe it has a little bit of an RPG flavor to it.

00:12:24.283 --> 00:12:24.704
We'll have to see it.

00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:31.476
You know, every time Ina-senpai has a 3D live, just the world and the atmosphere is so unique to her.

00:12:31.496 --> 00:12:32.558
Ina-atmosphere.

00:12:33.247 --> 00:12:38.693
I'm really looking forward to what kind of things she's going to do, songs she's going to sing, dance to.

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:41.295
And you know, especially with her guests too.

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:46.981
Yeah, my guests this time are Watame-senpai, Aki-senpai, Botan-senpai, and Bain-senpai!

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.563
BAU BAU!

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:51.966
I wonder what sort of shenanigans are going to happen.

00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:52.567
Shenanigans?

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:53.147
Shenanigans!

00:12:53.228 --> 00:12:56.371
Just imagining their voices together with Ina-senpai's beautiful voice.

00:12:56.391 --> 00:12:58.533
You can't spell shenanigans without Ina.

00:12:58.553 --> 00:12:59.554
I'm pretty sure.

00:12:59.574 --> 00:13:01.196
Is that how it works?

00:13:01.216 --> 00:13:02.477
I'm pretty sure.

00:13:02.828 --> 00:13:04.511
You spell shenanigan with Ina?

00:13:06.073 --> 00:13:07.796
Okay, Ruffians, show us!

00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:09.499
How would you do it?

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:10.080
Is it true?

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:12.244
It's true?

00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:13.065
It's true?

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.127
Yes, it's true!

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:15.910
I don't see it.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:19.216
You can't spell shenanigan without Ina.

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:21.620
Yes.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.581
Shedanigans.

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:23.563
Okay.

00:13:24.184 --> 00:13:25.326
Yes.

00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:28.076
FUWAMOCO But you guys have my sweetie live.

00:13:28.096 --> 00:13:33.625
It's gonna be happening on her birthday on May 20th at 7pm PT.

00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:37.732
Or May 21st at 11am JST.

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:41.138
So we hope that you'll be there cheering her on for her birthday.

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:46.194
BAU BAU!

00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:48.098
BAU BAU!

00:13:48.278 --> 00:13:49.521
BAU BAU!

00:13:51.025 --> 00:14:00.105
BAU BAU!

00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:01.588
Fight a tournament!

00:14:01.768 --> 00:14:07.939
That was the hololive Animal Tower Battle Tournament!

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.285
Animal Battle Tower!

00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:13.149
Animal Tower Battle!

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:15.894
I guess the animals form a tower and then you battle.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:18.178
Yeah, animals don't go into a tower and battle.

00:14:18.665 --> 00:14:19.586
I guess that makes sense.

00:14:20.668 --> 00:14:28.158
But this is the second time it's organized by Lui-senpai and this time co-host was Subaru-senpai.

00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:34.306
And you know it's the second time it grew quite a bit this time with over 20 members.

00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:34.927
Is it actually 20?

00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:36.409
Let's count.

00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:37.951
I think Lui-senpai said over 20.

00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:39.133
She's very nervous.

00:14:39.554 --> 00:14:41.156
I can't.

00:14:41.176 --> 00:14:42.057
I don't want to count.

00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:43.976
A lot of members!

00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:47.840
Members from JP, IG, EN, The Voice too!

00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:54.827
But from EN we have Kari-senpai, Ina-senpai, Alice, FUWAMOCO, and Cecilia!

00:14:54.847 --> 00:14:56.108
And we did really well!

00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:01.413
For Ruffians that maybe not too sure what this game is, it's a very simple, fun game.

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:05.777
You have some animals, and then you want to stack them on top of them into a tower.

00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:08.500
And whoever falls over loses.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.265
Yeah, if you cause the tower to fall, then that person loses.

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:15.248
It's a very simple game, but tricky.

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:17.771
You know, a lot of luck is necessary.

00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:19.033
Yes, skill.

00:15:19.113 --> 00:15:21.436
Yeah, you know, there's other tricks.

00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:27.683
You know, this animal, you might be able to get the animal to kind of hook off the platform, make the platform bigger.

00:15:27.984 --> 00:15:28.324
Yeah.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.626
It's not so simple.

00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:31.388
It's very addicting in a way.

00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:32.069
And we did amazing.

00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.670
Yeah.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.533
And luck was...

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:09.309
She won!

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:09.429
Yeah!

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:09.609
BAU BAU!

00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:10.170
Congratulations!

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.970
There she is!

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.272
She got a snazzy trophy.

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:12.412
Right!

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:17.216
The Animal Tower Battle Tournament trophy there.

00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:20.619
But she is very humble, very gracious.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:26.385
And she said that she'll continue playing lots of the Animal Tower Battle in her free time all the time.

00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:27.306
All the time.

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.127
All the time.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:28.887
I believe her.

00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:29.948
She doesn't make songs anymore.

00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:33.972
She just plays Animal Tower Battle.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:43.007
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:50.920
Have a howl of a day!

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:57.411
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:08.509
I don't know how it was, but we were able to match randomly with Poruru-oneechan multiple times!

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:11.093
And then even with Kanade too!

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:14.438
And then Poruru-oneechan also matched with Nico!

00:17:15.363 --> 00:17:16.864
Ruffians, where are you?

00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:18.666
Your chants, you missed it!

00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:19.987
You missed your chants!

00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:22.970
You couldn't match randomly with random hololive members!

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.511
Right!

00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:24.892
Right!

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:26.934
You missed out!

00:17:26.954 --> 00:17:28.255
You didn't think of this!

00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:29.516
You tried!

00:17:29.957 --> 00:17:30.818
At least you tried.

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:33.340
You don't have a switch.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.841
Ah, then it makes it difficult.

00:17:34.982 --> 00:17:37.164
You can't do it on phone to try to match with switch.

00:17:37.444 --> 00:17:38.865
Yeah, there is a phone version.

00:17:38.885 --> 00:17:41.468
Apparently the phone version is very popular too.

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.931
But they are not cross-compatible, so...

00:17:44.911 --> 00:17:45.974
That's too bad.

00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:48.000
But it was a lot of fun!

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:50.889
So we're happy to be able to participate.

00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:52.454
Hopefully there'll be a third one too.

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:56.025
Yeah, we definitely beat Ruffia-senpai and Ollie-senpai.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:57.790
Not in the slightest.

00:17:58.968 --> 00:18:00.891
BAU BAU!

00:18:01.191 --> 00:18:04.976
It's always fun being able to play games like that together with everyone though.

00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:06.037
You never know what's gonna happen.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:07.359
Right.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.884
And speaking of things that you don't know what's gonna happen.

00:18:11.184 --> 00:18:13.127
FUWAMOCO!

00:18:13.147 --> 00:18:16.091
You know when there's call-ins, we like to do call-ins sometimes.

00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:18.394
But this time it was a call-in.

00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:22.038
We were called by a very unexpected person.

00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:29.987
By Ui-mama!

00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:31.268
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:32.490
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.910
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.571
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:34.873
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:35.053 --> 00:18:35.653

Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:38.356 --> 00:18:38.717
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:38.757 --> 00:18:39.618
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:40.158
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.760
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.241
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:43.722
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:43.743 --> 00:18:44.043
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:44.063 --> 00:18:44.383
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:44.403 --> 00:18:44.784
Ui-mama-sensei!

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:45.144

00:18:45.965 --> 00:18:47.989
Ui mama-sensei!

00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:50.474
And we were very nervous.

00:18:50.494 --> 00:18:52.358
Yes!

00:18:52.378 --> 00:18:54.081
Oh boy, did it come this that way?

00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:55.704
Nerissa!

00:18:57.488 --> 00:19:00.734
We're gonna be okay!

00:19:00.754 --> 00:19:02.518
But it was a lot of fun!

00:19:02.538 --> 00:19:06.326
We were able to chat about a bunch of different things we talked about.

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:07.568
You know, stuff like that.

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:28.358
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:28.338 --> 00:19:29.760
Heroines.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.523
It's a really really fun game.

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:32.004
Interesting game.

00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:33.667
But it's a little bit more retro.

00:19:34.308 --> 00:19:35.049
So I'm happy though.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.157
I feel that that fits Uemamo-sensei really well.

00:19:39.177 --> 00:19:42.683
And then we also asked her to educate her daughter better.

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:43.885
Give her a better education.

00:19:44.105 --> 00:19:54.042
Because her daughter, Subaru-senpai, told us that there's no such thing as the white school uniform swimsuits in Japan.

00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:55.808
That's wrong!

00:19:55.848 --> 00:19:56.549
It's a lie.

00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:57.611
It's a lie!

00:19:57.691 --> 00:20:01.717
So I... So we told her... She should maybe raise a daughter that doesn't lie.

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:02.318
Yeah.

00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:05.903
But she told us... That was FUWAMOCO.

00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:09.769
That's right though, they don't exist.

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:10.590
Which is not true.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.892
It's not true!

00:20:11.912 --> 00:20:12.854
It's not true!

00:20:12.874 --> 00:20:18.983
You see, in anime and games, you go to Akihabara, get there, and then...

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:23.641
Uemama-sensei asked us about our socks.

00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:26.369
We told her the sock situation.

00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:29.016
It was a very interesting conversation.

00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:34.331
A normal first time conversation.

00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:34.592
Very normal.

00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:37.296
Nekoze.

00:20:37.496 --> 00:20:52.277
Nekoze.

Very cool.

BAU BAU!

00:21:35.491 --> 00:21:40.643
This weekend, FUWAMOCO, we are playing a new game.

00:21:41.244 --> 00:21:43.048
A game called Fatal Frame.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:46.776
It's a very classic, famous PS2 horror game.

00:21:46.857 --> 00:21:48.941
We are starting from the very first game.

00:21:48.981 --> 00:21:50.906
My first time playing this game.

00:21:50.966 --> 00:21:52.369
Now what is this game about?

00:21:52.349 --> 00:21:56.536
Uh, well, uh, you know, there's a Himuro Mansion.

00:21:56.877 --> 00:22:02.546
And we have to find our brother, Mafuyu, who went in there to be able to find Mr. Takamine.

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:07.053
And things aren't going so well, we cannot find our brother, but we have this camera from Mom.

00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:12.322
And it sees the ghosts and spirits, so we're gonna use this camera to get rid of the ghosts and find our brother.

00:22:12.522 --> 00:22:13.284
Kill the dead ghosts.

00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:16.349
Yeah, drive them away with the camera, right?

00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:18.272
Are we saving them?

00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:20.869
Yeah!

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:21.911
Take positive.

00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:22.412
We're saving them.

00:22:22.432 --> 00:22:24.395
We're not killing them, we're saving them.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.038
Is that how it is?

00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:27.180
But!

00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:28.963
Moco-chan.

00:22:29.924 --> 00:22:36.115
You have something that you need to apologize about.

00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:38.439
There's an apology in order.

00:22:41.764 --> 00:22:42.285
Ruffians.

00:22:45.607 --> 00:22:49.095
I apologize for my crimes.

00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:57.615
The crimes which are hoarding items and reloading a couple times.

00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:00.682
Reloading of FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:03.649
Just a couple times.

00:23:04.928 --> 00:23:17.026
After the boss battle, because we used too many items, and I took too much damage, which would then use more items, so we will redo it.

00:23:18.568 --> 00:23:20.411
Did I beat the boss well enough?

00:23:21.172 --> 00:23:23.896
Is this good enough, Ruffians?

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:26.340
Those are the words that Moco-chan would utter non-stop.

00:23:27.561 --> 00:23:31.307
Moco-chan, but we learned, and the Ruffians assured you.

00:23:31.861 --> 00:23:35.124
Once the game is over, you cannot use the items anymore.

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:37.927
They will not transfer to the next game.

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:45.535
Thus, you must use the items, although limited, in the bosses in the game.

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:47.697
When we are hurt, we shall heal.

00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:49.839
We shall not heal with the reload.

00:23:50.459 --> 00:23:59.168
I apologize for my crimes of reloading too often and hoarding items.

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:02.940
Save the items!

00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.203
This is definitely saving a lot.

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:06.725
Too much gamer energy!

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:15.815
This is what you say now, but a couple months ago it was a different story, wasn't it?

00:24:16.376 --> 00:24:17.357
No gamer energy.

00:24:17.377 --> 00:24:20.300
FUWAMOCO has no gamer energy.

00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:27.889
Stories change quickly, huh?

00:24:28.274 --> 00:24:29.535
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:30.216
Huh?

00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.037
Why did you pause?

00:24:31.057 --> 00:24:32.098
You didn't say sorry.

00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:32.239
Sorry!

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.502
Have you learnt your lesson?

00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:37.064
No!

00:24:37.084 --> 00:24:37.184
What?

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:41.049
BAU BAU!

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.430
FUWAMOCO!

00:24:48.637 --> 00:24:49.158
It's time!

00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:49.759
It's time!

00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:53.623
I wanna see a little bit of FWMCMORNING!

00:24:54.295 --> 00:24:57.985
We get to see who's the Doggie of the Day today!

00:24:58.005 --> 00:25:02.377
Today's Doggie of the Day is... That is Pudding!

00:25:02.678 --> 00:25:05.706
Pudding!

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:11.089
She's only 7 months old!

00:25:13.293 --> 00:25:14.715
That's a baby!

00:25:15.356 --> 00:25:19.923
Pudding is very rectangular and I like it!

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:20.865
Pudding!

00:25:20.885 --> 00:25:22.788
So cute!

00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:30.220
But you know I'm happy to say Pudding is an FUWAMOCO Morning too!

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.681
Is that a puppy?

00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:52.737
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Pudding BAU BAU?

00:25:54.657 --> 00:26:00.483
All I can imagine is Pudding running from one side to the other.

00:26:00.503 --> 00:26:22.825
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:26:23.851 --> 00:26:41.168
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:41.148 --> 00:26:42.870
Playtime!

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:43.230
More playtime!

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.972
The word associated with playtime is BAU BAU.

00:26:46.092 --> 00:26:46.753
BAU BAU!

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:49.596
I'm just so impressed.

00:26:49.616 --> 00:26:50.036
It's good.

00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:52.779
Pudding has a good play rhythm going.

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.221
You know she hasn't mastered it in 7 months.

00:26:55.301 --> 00:26:57.323
Impressive.

00:26:57.343 --> 00:26:59.304
7 months and already so stable.

00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:00.526
Right.

00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:10.755
Yeah well, we hope she has lots of fun chasing after the ball and that you BAU BAU lots together during your playtime.

00:27:10.775 --> 00:27:10.935
BAU BAU!

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:13.568
Thank you!

00:27:13.588 --> 00:27:18.094
Well, next we have... Today I went on a walk.

00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:18.935
You went on a walk?

00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:20.156
I went on a walk!

00:27:21.377 --> 00:27:24.281
Well then, why don't you go for a walk this time?

00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:26.483
Let's take a look!

00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:29.907
De-den!

00:27:29.927 --> 00:27:31.429
I bought a surprise book.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.271
What is this?

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:36.535
It looks like a scene from a video game.

00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:51.840
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.848
It sounds a little spooky, right?

00:27:55.868 --> 00:27:59.035
I guess it's not really a desert if there's four more hot springs, huh?

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:02.722
Maybe there was hot springs and then it dried up?

00:28:03.444 --> 00:28:03.965
And it's coarsed?

00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:08.855
Kinda looks like where we were in Metal Gear Solid 3, now, right?

00:28:08.875 --> 00:28:10.538
It sort of reminded me of that.

00:28:10.518 --> 00:28:12.280
No ghosts!

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.621
No!

00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:16.025
I don't think there's gonna be any rations or calorie meat there though.

00:28:16.466 --> 00:28:16.726
No.

00:28:17.928 --> 00:28:20.091
Maybe snakes.

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:21.152
Maybe rats.

00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:22.233
Maybe rats, yeah.

00:28:22.454 --> 00:28:22.994
No frogs.

00:28:23.014 --> 00:28:27.000
But you're not gonna be eating them because you're not a snake eater.

00:28:31.025 --> 00:28:31.325
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:31.345 --> 00:28:34.129
Thank you for giving us FUWAMOCO!

00:28:34.109 --> 00:28:37.693
And next we have our Question of the Day.

00:28:37.913 --> 00:28:40.316
What questions do you have on your mind, Ruffians?

00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:41.838
Let's take a look.

00:28:42.058 --> 00:28:43.100
De-den!

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.203
I know you both like cats a lot.

00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:47.084
This is true.

00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:50.288
I was wondering on your individual cat preferences.

00:28:50.608 --> 00:28:53.392
Do you both have the same favorite kind of cats?

00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:58.758
Or are there individual personal preferences for what makes the ideal cat for you two?

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:00.640
Well.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.941
Cats are cats.

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:02.241
Cats.

00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:03.963
Kittens are for eating.

00:29:04.063 --> 00:29:04.964
Cats are for huffing.

00:29:05.304 --> 00:29:05.684
Kittens.

00:29:06.205 --> 00:29:07.926
Yes, they're cute though.

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:08.447
Kittens are cute.

00:29:08.467 --> 00:29:11.830
This is a common sense basic knowledge, okay?

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.210
Oh yeah.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:16.954
But, you know, I think kittens, they're good, but it's better when they've grown up, you know?

00:29:16.994 --> 00:29:20.477
Now they have more of a personality and a cat-itude.

00:29:20.497 --> 00:29:24.181
I keep on asking Biboo, is John Cat bigger yet?

00:29:26.643 --> 00:29:28.905
How is John Cat growing?

00:29:29.425 --> 00:29:34.316
Big yet... Kittens are for eating!

00:29:34.336 --> 00:29:35.518
Kittens are for eating!

00:29:35.538 --> 00:29:38.665
You know, kittens are for eating.

00:29:38.685 --> 00:29:39.507
Snack on the go.

00:29:42.012 --> 00:29:46.101
But you know, a cat is a cat.

00:29:46.081 --> 00:29:48.445
I think we both have the same preferences, right?

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:48.766
Yeah.

00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:49.107
Cat!

00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:49.928
I like cat.

00:29:50.048 --> 00:29:50.890
Cat's a good cat.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.092
But the best!

00:29:52.112 --> 00:29:52.313
What?

00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:53.274
The best kind of cat.

00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:56.400
If we're gonna be really picky... I like short hair.

00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:59.566
You know where the fur is sort of dense?

00:29:59.586 --> 00:29:59.967
What?

00:29:59.987 --> 00:30:02.011
You know you pet them and they're like, oh that's a cat.

00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:03.373
Oh, that's a good pet.

00:30:03.393 --> 00:30:04.275
But then...

00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:06.856
Fat face.

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:08.338
Fatty face cat.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.044
Yes.

00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:16.189
Fatty face cat.

00:30:17.311 --> 00:30:18.212
Big cheeks.

00:30:18.332 --> 00:30:19.554
Different from squish faces.

00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:24.481
I like it when the cats are nice and happy.

00:30:24.501 --> 00:30:28.727
You know they're happy they can breathe well.

00:30:28.707 --> 00:30:43.813
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:30:43.793 --> 00:30:45.576
A unique looking cat.

00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:47.018
Yeah, I know.

00:30:47.398 --> 00:30:49.622
Ah, this is that cat.

00:30:49.642 --> 00:30:50.863
Yes, that cat.

00:30:51.264 --> 00:30:53.147
Yeah, I know.

00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:55.190
White kitty's a cute toothy.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.091
All cats are good.

00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:57.493
All cats are cute.

00:30:57.513 --> 00:30:57.894
Yeah.

00:30:58.335 --> 00:30:59.717
All cats are joy.

00:31:00.057 --> 00:31:01.820
I love my little angels.

00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:05.024
Healthy cats are good though.

00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:05.846
Yeah, you know.

00:31:06.106 --> 00:31:06.747
Yeah.

00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:09.835
Even hairless cats?

00:31:10.015 --> 00:31:10.095
Yes!

00:31:10.115 --> 00:31:10.256
Yeah!

00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:11.838
They're very kind cats.

00:31:11.918 --> 00:31:17.387
Yeah, you know they have a lot of requirements for taking care of them.

00:31:17.407 --> 00:31:18.629
You have to wash them yourself.

00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:20.712
Yeah, you know, you have to put oil on them.

00:31:20.732 --> 00:31:21.393
I think you have to.

00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:22.495
They have to wear clothing.

00:31:22.535 --> 00:31:25.279
Put clothing on the cats?

00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:25.519
Yeah.

00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:27.242
All cats are tasty.

00:31:27.262 --> 00:31:27.843
They are.

00:31:27.863 --> 00:31:28.564
They are!

00:31:28.584 --> 00:31:29.726
Cats are delicious.

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:32.651
But I want them to cuddle me so that I don't have to come to them.

00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:35.535
That they cuddle me and then I feel like a princess.

00:31:36.865 --> 00:31:38.007
Thanks for that, Moco-chan.

00:31:39.129 --> 00:31:41.012
You're welcome!

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:41.192
BAU BAU!

00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:42.594
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:31:42.614 --> 00:31:44.698
Thank you for all your submissions!

00:31:44.998 --> 00:31:47.643
We're always looking for more questions!

00:31:47.663 --> 00:31:49.946
Thank you for all your questions recently!

00:31:50.147 --> 00:31:52.150
Your Pero sightings, you know!

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.337
Show us where Pero's been, and then maybe we can, you know, know her, you know?

00:31:56.357 --> 00:31:58.300
Just having this breakfast and then...

00:31:58.651 --> 00:32:18.448
FUWAMOCO are always up to new things!

00:32:18.428 --> 00:32:22.197
This is what our schedule for this week kinda takes a look at.

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:23.220
Kinda takes a look at?

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.082
Let's take a look at it!

00:32:24.102 --> 00:32:25.586
Let's take a look.

00:32:26.588 --> 00:32:27.290
De-den!

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.200
Wow, there's still a lot of things up in the air this week, Ruffians.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.252
But we thought that you know, sharing this at least would help give you a little bit of an idea.

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:38.845
Are you serious?

00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:39.226
Are we not?

00:32:39.246 --> 00:32:42.931
You know, we have a bunch of preparational classes coming up.

00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:49.802
You know, we're gonna be an anime voter for the Super Perroquet Party!

00:32:49.882 --> 00:32:52.666
But there are also lots of exciting things coming up.

00:32:53.287 --> 00:32:56.171
Maybe we can share them with you soon.

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:57.533
Maybe.

00:32:57.573 --> 00:32:59.656
What's behind the question, question, question marks?

00:32:59.677 --> 00:32:59.957
Who knows?

00:33:00.017 --> 00:33:02.661
Maybe there's a lot of exciting things, huh?

00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:06.045
But we'll do our best this week!

00:33:06.065 --> 00:33:07.487
And we'll see you for FUWAMOCO Morning too!

00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:13.473
And hopefully for the Ruffians in Boston, we'll see you in BAU BAU BAU Boston too!

00:33:13.593 --> 00:33:15.616
BAU BAU!

00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:23.204
And for the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU DO PEACE!

00:33:23.605 --> 00:33:24.666
BAU BAU!

00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:31.415
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:37.864
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:33:38.345 --> 00:33:39.266
Grandma!

00:33:39.286 --> 00:33:40.568
BAU BAU!

00:33:40.808 --> 00:33:41.649
Kitsuneko!

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.352
BAU BAU!

00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:44.393
Bakusou!

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:45.675
BAU BAU!

00:33:45.655 --> 00:34:05.790
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:23.834
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:33.567
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
