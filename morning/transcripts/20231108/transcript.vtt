00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.730
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.935
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:30.479
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:32.862
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:38.654
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:41.715
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:44.716
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:46.257
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:51.640
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.581
Ruffians.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.402
Good morning.

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:59.544
Thank you for joining us for our 41st episode!

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:00.064
BAU BAU!

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:08.227
Our 41st episode and 101st stream.

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:10.108
Still lots of stuff to do!

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.231
Ruffians, in case maybe you forgot.

00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:17.072
Oh, we definitely forgot.

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:24.836
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:25.657
A.K.A.

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:26.637
FUWAMOCO Live!

00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:29.499
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.644
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:42.689
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.451
Ruffians, are you ready?

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:46.752
You awake?

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:48.654
Ready to BAU BAU?

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.255
A brand new day.

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:51.516
BAU BAU!

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:56.440
Well, let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.661
BAU BAU!

00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:02.893
And with that, the morning starts.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:03.713
It starts.

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:05.414
The day starts.

00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:07.255
Whether you want it to or not.

00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:09.236
It just does.

00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:15.719
But again today, I think a Ruffian has had another peron sighting!

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.761
Hopefully it's not too scary.

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:19.681
Let's see this time.

00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:22.903
October there was a lot of those, but... Not this time.

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:24.564
What?

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:27.620
De-den!

00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:35.844
There's a lot of powerful energy coming from this Pero Sighting.

00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:43.127
It's cool, but I'm somehow a bit frightened.

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:52.551
You know Gunpla use a pretty small scale, but somehow it's really hard to tell just how big it is from this photo.

00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:58.027
I feel like it almost makes Pero look like, huge, nice.

00:07:58.207 --> 00:08:03.393
Did Pero feel a bit threatened and want to get a Gundam to use to intimidate others or something?

00:08:03.493 --> 00:08:04.814
Intimidation.

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:06.596
That's his tactic.

00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:08.198
I mean, it makes sense.

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.462
Pero can look pretty cute and harmless at first glance.

00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:14.325
So, I guess I can understand, but...

00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:18.010
This Gundam looks a bit different from the others.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:26.678
To tell the truth, Ruffians, we know very, very, very little about Gundam.

00:08:27.138 --> 00:08:31.643
We watch Suisei no Majou, you know, the Witch of Mercury, but even then,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.634
We had a little bit of a hard time following along.

00:08:37.075 --> 00:08:41.020
I don't know, I just didn't feel smart enough to understand sometimes.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.583
It was really good though, but I just didn't own it.

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:55.138
I thought it was good, apparently it's not.

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:59.963
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.243 --> 00:09:03.908
Hopefully Pero didn't cause too much mischief though, okay?

00:09:03.988 --> 00:09:07.952
BAU BAU!

00:09:08.293 --> 00:09:10.055
I like to build gunpla.

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:11.196
Yeah, I like that.

00:09:11.336 --> 00:09:11.737
No more.

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:15.578
Wow, Ruffians.

00:09:15.758 --> 00:09:20.763
I mentioned that today is the 101st day of FUWAMOCO.

00:09:20.964 --> 00:09:29.233
But in case you didn't know, yesterday was our 100th day together!

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:30.394
BAU BAU!

00:09:30.454 --> 00:09:31.736
That makes today our

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:35.343
Our 101st day as members of hololive!

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.472
I wanted to mention again, you know, yesterday was our big celebration of 101 days since our debut.

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:55.253
No, yesterday was our celebration of 100.

00:09:56.113 --> 00:09:56.333
100 days!

00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:58.154
100 days since debut!

00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:00.555
It was not just that.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:05.676
It was also 100 days continuously streaming every day!

00:10:05.876 --> 00:10:08.637
And those days being scheduled in advance, you know?

00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:09.838
Being on time, too.

00:10:10.618 --> 00:10:12.960
Perfect attendance.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.862
That can be tricky sometimes, you know?

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:18.664
Ruffians!

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:23.147
If you were a teacher, what grade would you give us?

00:10:23.807 --> 00:10:24.768
Teacher Ruffians.

00:10:25.008 --> 00:10:30.152
I'm reading!

00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:33.774
S+, is that good?

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:34.655
A+, 100!

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:35.015
Yeah!

00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:45.802
Well, you know, it was a really special 100 days filled with lots of memories.

00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:53.969
And we hope that it's a little bit of a snapshot into the rest of our days that are ahead of us for many years to come.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.050
Just a snapshot, right?

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:01.955
But I guess now that it's been 100 days, you'd probably like to see what our room looks like too, huh?

00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:05.418
Not just the studio.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:07.840
Maybe.

00:11:09.363 --> 00:11:11.044
Well, we'll have to see!

00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:12.305
Who knows?

00:11:12.585 --> 00:11:19.989
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your love, your warmth, and support!

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.690
Thank you!

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.672
BAU BAU!

00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:25.533
Here's to many, many more days, okay?

00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:27.334
Yeah, many, many more days.

00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:30.316
Doing our celebration.

00:11:31.331 --> 00:11:33.934
It wasn't just chit-chat.

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:39.341
We also brought a mirror out so that you could finally see what you really look like.

00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.684
Not just, like, rough scribbles from us.

00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:48.666
Wow.

00:11:48.846 --> 00:11:50.266
What do you think?

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:52.247
What do you think?

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.667
How do you look, Ruffians?

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:57.288
Yeah, we have two different designs.

00:11:57.589 --> 00:11:59.289
Originally by each of us, you know.

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:03.170
Moco-chan with the pink, the cool looking Ruffian.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.412
And mine, the silly and cute blue Ruffian.

00:12:09.092 --> 00:12:19.382
These are just the official looks though, so Ruffians, if you feel like you're neither or maybe a mix of both, please feel free to design and draw a Ruffian a bit more suitable for yourself, okay?

00:12:19.703 --> 00:12:24.067
This is just like the, maybe the majority of Ruffians official designs.

00:12:25.728 --> 00:12:32.791
Thank you so much to Oriente for the super cute finished designs and for making them come to life too.

00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:33.732
Right!

00:12:33.772 --> 00:12:34.492
Thank you!

00:12:34.532 --> 00:12:35.432
Thank you!

00:12:35.472 --> 00:12:36.153
Ruffians!

00:12:36.413 --> 00:12:39.554
Are you excited now that you know exactly what you look like?

00:12:42.335 --> 00:12:42.775
Pussies!

00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:43.876
You want pussies!

00:12:44.236 --> 00:12:45.557
Is a mohawk necessary?

00:12:46.397 --> 00:12:46.717
Yeah.

00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:50.219
I guess you could have a different hairstyle if you really wanted.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:50.819
Yeah!

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:53.480
But I don't know, it makes you look cooler, no?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.561
Magnets!

00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:56.341
Mhmm.

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:10.178
That'll be fun.

00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:14.341
Every time you walk by, you can look at it and like, touch the nose.

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:15.983
We really like magnets.

00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:16.763
That's all.

00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:19.686
BAU BAU!

00:13:20.346 --> 00:13:22.088
Thank you!

00:13:22.128 --> 00:13:24.010
We look forward to seeing more of you Ruffians.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.910
I know.

00:13:27.533 --> 00:13:30.577
Yesterday was a very special day, right?

00:13:30.737 --> 00:13:33.360
But it wasn't just our special day.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.223
It was actually not even our special day.

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:38.626
It was special, but it wasn't that special.

00:13:43.952 --> 00:13:50.535
Yesterday was actually hololive Indonesia's Zetta-senpai's birthday!

00:13:51.015 --> 00:13:53.276
Zetta-senpai, happy birthday!

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:55.877
And, Ruffians, did you notice?

00:13:55.957 --> 00:14:00.478
We're actually guests on her birthday too!

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:07.421
You know, Zetta-senpai asked us what we'd do if our birthday- If it was her birthday and we got stuck in a time loop.

00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:11.063
And what we would do if we woke up in her body.

00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:15.760
Just ignore Fuwawa's answer in particular for that doukei.

00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:23.976
Mai, I feel like if our birthday was stuck in a loop, we'd just be this type of people who celebrate their birthdays for the whole month.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:25.872
I don't know.

00:14:25.972 --> 00:14:26.933
I think it's just silly.

00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:32.076
You know, a birthday is special because it's that single special day.

00:14:32.616 --> 00:14:33.096
One day.

00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:33.557
You know what?

00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:38.799
If you celebrate for the whole month, that's just an excuse to spend one twelfth of the year partying, okay?

00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:42.942
It has to be that one special day.

00:14:43.642 --> 00:14:47.744
One day for Mococo and one day for Fuwawa, okay?

00:14:48.384 --> 00:14:49.184
Not a whole month.

00:14:51.145 --> 00:14:56.827
But you know, I think it's important to celebrate a special day when it's special.

00:14:56.847 --> 00:14:57.148
It is!

00:14:57.268 --> 00:14:59.048
We're very sentimental, you know that.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.451
I would like to see Zetta-senpai keep talking so chill.

00:15:07.312 --> 00:15:07.912
It's important.

00:15:07.932 --> 00:15:08.692
BAU BAU!

00:15:08.772 --> 00:15:11.373
Happy birthday, Zetta-senpai!

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:14.369
Hi!

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.031
Well, Ruffians, you remember what I said on Monday, right?

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.252
What did you say on Monday?

00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:22.152
You say a lot of things.

00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:25.013
On Monday, did I say FUWAMOCO Morning right?

00:15:25.053 --> 00:15:26.634
We had no misunderstandings.

00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:27.474
Oh.

00:15:27.874 --> 00:15:28.334
Yeah.

00:15:29.355 --> 00:15:42.640
And, you know, Ruffians, I was a little bit concerned because I thought, you know, maybe, maybe, there's a little bit of a feeling that that might have been not correct.

00:15:44.198 --> 00:15:50.029
Yeah, we thought we were good, but... Ruffians, why didn't you say anything?

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:50.890
Huh?

00:15:51.632 --> 00:15:52.213
Huh?

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:54.717
You didn't say a thing.

00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:56.280
Yeah.

00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:05.258
Was it because you were trying to be nice?

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:15.903
It seems, you know, Ruffians, that there was a misunderstanding left over from during Donkey Kong Country.

00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:30.204
Ruffians, do you remember being as shocked as I was when you heard Moco-chan give a sudden, intense compliment to Donkey Kong out of nowhere?

00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:30.764
I didn't!

00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:32.825
Yeah, I didn't.

00:16:33.846 --> 00:16:34.487
I was shocked.

00:16:35.247 --> 00:16:38.969
Yeah, but Moco-chan, what did you say, huh?

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.271
It's a misunderstanding, okay?

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:46.074
All I said was that... You're gonna make me repeat it.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.803
I said, Donkey Kong is really hot, huh?

00:16:51.843 --> 00:16:54.126
But I meant the game, okay?

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:57.188
It was not a compliment to Donkey Kong.

00:16:57.469 --> 00:16:59.631
We get really hot while playing the game.

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:03.234
And at the time, I thought all of you were being crazy.

00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:07.078
And I still think that, but when I listen to it over,

00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:09.932
I guess I could hear her.

00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:11.353
But Ruffians!

00:17:12.193 --> 00:17:15.874
First of all, why would you think that I would be a puppy that would say something like that?

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:16.314
Hai.

00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:17.454
I'm Mococo.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:19.055
We spent a hundred days together.

00:17:19.075 --> 00:17:20.455
You should know me better than that.

00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:20.895
Hai.

00:17:21.555 --> 00:17:22.916
I'm not that kind of person.

00:17:23.816 --> 00:17:25.156
Maybe that's a Nerissa thing.

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:26.797
Or maybe a Shiori thing.

00:17:27.257 --> 00:17:28.657
But it's not a Mococo thing!

00:17:29.818 --> 00:17:31.218
I obviously meant the game, okay?

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:35.700
Donkey Kong is very hot because it makes us hot while playing it.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.980
Lots of screaming.

00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.301
Very scary.

00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:39.081
Falling.

00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:39.922
Screaming.

00:17:40.222 --> 00:17:41.463
Bananas.

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:43.223
Understand, okay?

00:17:43.243 --> 00:17:44.064
Yeah.

00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:45.164
Got it.

00:17:45.705 --> 00:17:46.385
Not judging.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:47.626
Are you sure?

00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:50.887
You just threw Nerissa in the bus.

00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:51.728
I'm sure.

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.729
I'm sure she likes Donkey Kong.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.990
Yeah.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.551
She likes Donkey Kong too, but not like that.

00:17:58.571 --> 00:17:59.371
Not like that.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.372
Not like Nerissa does.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.631
BAU BAU!

00:18:04.691 --> 00:18:05.271
BAU BAU!

00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:10.954
Understood now, right?

00:18:12.754 --> 00:18:15.396
BAU BAU!

00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:16.396
You understand now, right?

00:18:17.877 --> 00:18:19.097
Please don't misunderstand.

00:18:19.117 --> 00:18:21.598
Moco-chan wasn't giving any weird compliments.

00:18:21.878 --> 00:18:22.298
No!

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.899
I was just saying that it's hot.

00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:27.870
Playing Donkey Kong.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.112
Ruffian!

00:18:32.132 --> 00:18:34.394
I had another dream.

00:18:34.994 --> 00:18:36.515
Two days in a row!

00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:39.237
And this one.

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.669
It was really unexpected, but a happy dream.

00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:45.189
That's good.

00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:45.949
Yeah.

00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:52.770
I don't know, maybe it's because it's getting colder out now, and I feel really chilly in bed sometimes.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.391
I felt really chilly this morning too.

00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.071
But, you know what?

00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:05.533
Ruffians, I think because of that, that's why I had a dream where it was really snowy.

00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:08.249
Ruffians!

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.733
I was going sledding, and you were all pulling the sled through the snow for me!

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:21.457
And you know when I looked out, I could see all of you right in front, running like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU.

00:19:21.858 --> 00:19:23.979
And you were all glowing and shining!

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.000
Glowing Ruffians.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.681
Yeah.

00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:28.702
I don't know where we are going though, but...

00:19:29.406 --> 00:19:34.208
I was just, I was really excited and I felt really warm too.

00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:39.210
But all I could see was in the front, like in front of me, so you Ruffians.

00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:42.192
And then a little bit to what was like the side.

00:19:42.252 --> 00:19:42.932
That makes sense.

00:19:42.972 --> 00:19:44.353
That's how vision works.

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:45.273
Yeah, I guess.

00:19:45.373 --> 00:19:47.794
But it was just all white snow.

00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:50.376
Yeah, and we were going really, really fast.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.201
And I didn't know why.

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:54.261
Why?

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:55.202
Why so fast?

00:19:55.302 --> 00:19:55.682
Yeah.

00:19:55.782 --> 00:19:57.143
Because you're on a sled!

00:19:57.163 --> 00:20:02.225
And even though you know, like, well, sometimes you can go slow on the sled too, right?

00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:03.326
I don't know.

00:20:03.846 --> 00:20:04.206
I don't know.

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:09.129
Even though we were going really fast, I didn't know where we were going, and it's cold and stuff too.

00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:10.530
I was really comfy.

00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:12.853
That's good.

00:20:13.353 --> 00:20:18.195
But I was a bit annoyed though, because for some reason you couldn't hear me.

00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:21.235
And so then we couldn't really talk that well together.

00:20:21.255 --> 00:20:22.656
No communication.

00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:22.716
No.

00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:30.177
And then... Ruffians, you're all pretty small dogs.

00:20:30.338 --> 00:20:31.958
Small dogs, but they're fast.

00:20:33.638 --> 00:20:37.699
There was a lot of Ruffians though, but you know, not the usual slight dogs.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:40.460
It was a little silly, like toy dogs.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.871
Toy dogs!

00:20:42.731 --> 00:20:48.575
But it was cute because I could see you all doing your best and working together as a team.

00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:50.797
I'm not a chihuahua!

00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:54.399
Not a chihuahua!

00:20:54.459 --> 00:20:55.420
But that was my dream!

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.142
A bit strange, but a happy one.

00:20:58.622 --> 00:20:59.222
Makes sense.

00:20:59.523 --> 00:21:00.603
Toy Ruffians.

00:21:00.763 --> 00:21:07.208
I'm happy to share another dream with you Ruffians!

00:21:07.368 --> 00:21:09.790
I'm happy that it's better than my dreams recently!

00:21:11.307 --> 00:21:14.930
We are... We are... BAU BAU!

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.971
BAU BAU!

00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:21.735
Ruffians, we saw you talking a bit about this yesterday.

00:21:21.755 --> 00:21:29.020
And, uh, so we thought that maybe we should share something, but I don't know, it's a little bit embarrassing.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.941
I don't know, it is.

00:21:30.021 --> 00:21:36.726
I don't know why, but... You know, I think it came up in the 100 day stream yesterday, right?

00:21:38.857 --> 00:21:48.322
But, Ruffians, when we were just tiny, tiny baby puppers, there was a show that we always watched with Mococo-B.

00:21:48.803 --> 00:21:52.925
And it was a show that was really special to her.

00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:59.789
It was her favorite... Star Trek!

00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:01.970
Yeah, you know...

00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:07.134
So, it was really special, so she shared it with us when we were still really little.

00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:12.097
We don't really remember much, but our favorite part was about the fluffy and fuzzy tribbles.

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.958
Yeah, the tribbles everywhere.

00:22:14.978 --> 00:22:17.360
She even gave us a plushie of them as a present.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.741
Yeah, and a shake.

00:22:19.201 --> 00:22:20.122
I'm excited.

00:22:20.622 --> 00:22:24.564
Yeah, but we also did watch Star Wars a lot, too.

00:22:24.904 --> 00:22:27.666
Yeah, and that's what we liked the best there.

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:33.370
Yeah, we like the Fluffy and the Fuzzy Ewoks the most.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.551
Do you understand, Ruffians?

00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:37.712
I wonder why, huh?

00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:43.896
Yeah, but Mama Puppy likes Star Trek better, and Papa Puppy likes Star Wars better.

00:22:44.736 --> 00:22:51.861
But I think maybe between the both of them, the Abyssgard household

00:22:53.376 --> 00:22:54.857
Probably a Star Trek household.

00:22:54.877 --> 00:22:55.518
Probably.

00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:56.519
Yeah.

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:59.942
But no fights between Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy.

00:23:00.043 --> 00:23:01.264
They agree to disagree.

00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.346
Right.

00:23:03.826 --> 00:23:04.387
Yeah.

00:23:04.687 --> 00:23:07.490
I feel envy.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.111
Speaking of Yamato!

00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:10.613
No, this is Star Trek.

00:23:10.713 --> 00:23:12.655
This is Star Trek, this is Star Wars.

00:23:12.755 --> 00:23:13.996
Not Yamato, no!

00:23:14.056 --> 00:23:14.657
Not Yamato!

00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:15.698
No, it's good!

00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:17.359
I thought that too.

00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:21.777
There's a limit, okay?

00:23:22.717 --> 00:23:24.497
Imagine it's not the Yamato, okay?

00:23:25.817 --> 00:23:26.937
BAU BAU!

00:23:26.997 --> 00:23:28.618
BAU BAU!

00:23:29.338 --> 00:23:38.300
It's a little bit embarrassing, but... Yeah, that's a little bit of a view into the Abyssgard household.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.180
I guess... I thought... Maybe...

00:23:47.355 --> 00:23:49.436
Invite both some Ruffian spirits today.

00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:57.298
So... So... I wanted to say something!

00:23:57.318 --> 00:24:03.919
Good morning!

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.180
You're awake!

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.701
Your eyes are barely open, but you're awake!

00:24:11.894 --> 00:24:13.735
Good morning sleepyhead!

00:24:13.755 --> 00:24:16.237
You know, that's the thing.

00:24:16.537 --> 00:24:25.044
Even though your eyes aren't totally open, even though you're not totally awake, what matters is that you are up and you're here now.

00:24:27.345 --> 00:24:30.708
Sure, you might not be at your 100%, but that's okay!

00:24:31.108 --> 00:24:33.510
You can't give 100% to everything you do, okay?

00:24:34.711 --> 00:24:37.213
So for now, being only 50% awake is fine.

00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:46.318
The important thing is that task, wake up, it's done!

00:24:46.658 --> 00:24:49.178
Give yourself credit for that first step, okay?

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:54.340
And from here out, all the next steps of your day is going to be even easier!

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:03.103
If it's okay... Can I give you a tiny extra task for today?

00:25:03.143 --> 00:25:06.964
I think it would be nice, so...

00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:09.946
If it's okay.

00:25:10.606 --> 00:25:13.147
Extra task!

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:14.107
Okay.

00:25:14.527 --> 00:25:21.269
As you go about your day today, can you try to find one thing, just one thing that stands out to you and makes you happy?

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:23.810
It can be anything, okay?

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:34.412
For example, I talked about it, but when we went on a walk the other day, I was happy to see the one plant growing straight through the concrete, as if nothing was in its way, right?

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:37.333
Do something silly like that to remember the day by.

00:25:38.678 --> 00:25:39.199
You can do it!

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:39.759
Okay!

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.683
Be the plant that I saw yesterday!

00:25:42.703 --> 00:25:46.669
Let's make today a special one and be kind to ourselves.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.211
You can do it!

00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.855
You can get through to the weekend!

00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:52.357
Ganbatte ne!

00:25:52.857 --> 00:25:53.478
BAU BAU!

00:25:56.563 --> 00:25:59.364
BAU BAU!

00:25:59.464 --> 00:25:59.864
Got it!

00:26:00.504 --> 00:26:01.504
Got it, Ruffians!

00:26:01.564 --> 00:26:03.905
Moco-chan, you're giving homework now too?

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.886
Homework for the Ruffians as we work on our homework, huh?

00:26:07.906 --> 00:26:08.506
Exactly!

00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:13.168
You know what I'm looking forward to today?

00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:13.648
What?

00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:19.150
Doggie of the Day!

00:26:19.471 --> 00:26:24.976
Today's Doggie of the Day is this old man, Dino!

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:26.598
Dino's 13, you know?

00:26:26.678 --> 00:26:29.120
He doesn't look 13.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.722
He doesn't, right?

00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:34.566
He's very wise, but you know he isn't great or anything.

00:26:35.006 --> 00:26:39.449
Maybe... Is he going to get his fur dyed, maybe?

00:26:39.829 --> 00:26:40.590
That's okay.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.651
That's okay.

00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:42.952
No shame.

00:26:42.972 --> 00:26:48.516
Yeah, but you know... He just looks like he appreciates the world around him so much.

00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:48.996
He does!

00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:58.523
Yeah, you know... You know, all those walks you go on together... The ducks quacking and being annoying and squashing... I appreciate them too.

00:26:58.983 --> 00:27:01.585
All those things, yeah.

00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:03.886
It's a good way to view the world, you know?

00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:08.264
Well, how does dino BAU BAU?

00:27:08.284 --> 00:27:12.606
I feel like it's a surprisingly cute BAU BAU.

00:27:12.686 --> 00:27:12.986
Really?

00:27:13.026 --> 00:27:15.047
I feel like it's very quiet.

00:27:15.147 --> 00:27:16.168
Doesn't need to be loud.

00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:18.509
I feel like BAU BAU.

00:27:18.589 --> 00:27:19.810
BAU BAU.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.730
BAU BAU.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:21.611
BAU BAU.

00:27:21.851 --> 00:27:22.531
BAU BAU.

00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:25.793
It's a BAU BAU with a lot of wisdom behind it.

00:27:26.213 --> 00:27:27.394
Yeah, softness.

00:27:28.074 --> 00:27:29.315
Doesn't need attention.

00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:29.715
Yeah.

00:27:30.175 --> 00:27:30.735
Yeah.

00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:32.056
Very kind.

00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:36.333
Well, you know, Dino, yeah, Dino's very kind.

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:40.154
Enjoys life and the world around him.

00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:44.936
Thirteen years of wisdom is what's behind all that fluff and fuzz.

00:27:45.337 --> 00:27:51.579
Yeah, and he's just happy to be by your side, and most importantly, part of your world, too.

00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:59.383
Yeah, no matter how old he is or how great he might get from here on, especially when the dye starts to run out.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:06.501
I'm happy to be loved by you so much and to be able to spend lots of time with you.

00:28:07.842 --> 00:28:10.623
BAU BAU!

00:28:10.643 --> 00:28:11.923
13 years is amazing.

00:28:11.943 --> 00:28:15.444
Lots of special memories.

00:28:16.505 --> 00:28:19.226
Well, Ruffians, you've been walking those paws.

00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:21.486
Where did you go this time?

00:28:21.907 --> 00:28:22.787
Let's see!

00:28:23.427 --> 00:28:24.347
De-den!

00:28:24.908 --> 00:28:25.528
Squirrel!

00:28:25.548 --> 00:28:27.269
Look at those ears!

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:28.069
Oh my gosh.

00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:32.150
Ah, this is the best part of vlogs.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.690
You know, seeing things like squirrels and other cool things.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.211
Right, right.

00:28:38.231 --> 00:28:38.951
It's a good poodle.

00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:40.671
Right, it's a good poodle.

00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:43.051
It must have been really hard to get it too.

00:28:43.131 --> 00:28:43.692
And fast.

00:28:44.172 --> 00:28:45.752
Yeah, but his ears are so long.

00:28:45.812 --> 00:28:46.232
Right?

00:28:46.252 --> 00:28:47.712
That's what I noticed first.

00:28:47.772 --> 00:28:49.353
Longer than mine too.

00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:50.133
They stand right up.

00:28:52.053 --> 00:28:55.174
Well, I hope he can get really fat really soon.

00:28:55.214 --> 00:28:55.614
Yeah.

00:28:55.974 --> 00:28:57.014
She'll work on it.

00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:03.798
But you know, you're lucky that he's the type of squirrel to run away from you, though.

00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:05.619
To not run away?

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:06.839
No, to run away.

00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:07.500
Oh, really?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:15.003
Yeah, because we seem to have the opposite problem of us having to run away from the squirrels because they always are pretty aggressive.

00:29:15.023 --> 00:29:17.224
Yeah, I don't know.

00:29:17.684 --> 00:29:22.146
Maybe they see our ears and our tails and something awakens in them.

00:29:22.286 --> 00:29:26.067
I don't know, but I just don't want to get shaken up by a squirrel for the snacks, okay?

00:29:26.107 --> 00:29:27.668
You don't have it.

00:29:28.385 --> 00:29:30.166
It's embarrassing running away from them.

00:29:31.247 --> 00:29:32.388
I try to keep my distance.

00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:33.468
I'm not distracted.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.293
Ruffians, make sure that you get really warm.

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:42.514
Stay warm and cold when you go out, okay?

00:29:42.554 --> 00:29:43.235
Be safe, okay?

00:29:43.275 --> 00:29:45.776
You gotta be the fat squirrel too, okay?

00:29:46.897 --> 00:29:47.458
Bundle up.

00:29:47.538 --> 00:29:48.918
BAU BAU!

00:29:52.112 --> 00:29:55.015
Ruffians, we received another question!

00:29:55.256 --> 00:30:02.383
Today, our Question of the Day is... Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:30:02.543 --> 00:30:07.708
I wanted to thank you for making these last few months enjoyable to go through.

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:08.790
Thank you!

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.872
Thank you for being a wonderful...

00:30:11.432 --> 00:30:13.674
A wonderful part of our everyday, you know?

00:30:14.215 --> 00:30:16.577
Your streams are always the best part of my day.

00:30:17.077 --> 00:30:19.299
It always brightens my mood.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.900
Anyways!

00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:22.683
I have an important question to ask, right?

00:30:22.723 --> 00:30:23.323
The question.

00:30:24.224 --> 00:30:32.411
What's the color of your... Excuse me.

00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:35.907
Excuse me?

00:30:36.007 --> 00:30:38.568
What are you thinking?

00:30:38.948 --> 00:30:43.651
Just because it's been 100 days doesn't mean that you can ask those kinds of questions ever, okay?

00:30:43.671 --> 00:30:46.813
And you think that we'd actually answer it?

00:30:47.293 --> 00:30:48.254
You'd think that?

00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:51.636
We aren't the kind of dogs to do that and this is a morning show!

00:30:51.656 --> 00:30:53.157
It's a morning show!

00:30:53.737 --> 00:30:57.540
You know, we said maybe that we show you our room.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:03.826
But don't just think you can get away with asking stuff like this because maybe we're just a bit closer now, okay?

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:05.007
Okay, Ruffians?

00:31:05.027 --> 00:31:06.508
You got it!

00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:11.672
Ruffians... So that's... That's what you really like, huh?

00:31:12.593 --> 00:31:13.974
That's what you think of us, huh?

00:31:18.118 --> 00:31:19.319
My opinion has changed.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.321
BAU BAU.

00:31:25.109 --> 00:31:28.751
Well, I guess we should let them know what's coming next, Moco-chan.

00:31:28.771 --> 00:31:29.312
Should we?

00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:31.033
Should we even?

00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:37.196
Oh, and I guess we're looking for more questions if there are... Not questions like that!

00:31:37.336 --> 00:31:38.917
Morning show questions, Ruffians!

00:31:38.937 --> 00:31:39.918
Morning show questions!

00:31:39.938 --> 00:31:41.238
This is a morning show!

00:31:41.258 --> 00:31:45.321
But Kiara-senpai asked... No!

00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.001
No!

00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:47.262
This is a morning show!

00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:49.403
It wasn't good then either.

00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:52.405
Ruffians.

00:31:54.375 --> 00:31:55.816
Sometimes you need to be softer.

00:31:56.276 --> 00:31:58.677
Well, I guess we're looking for more questions.

00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:02.239
And, uh... Pero Sightings and your dogs too.

00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:03.379
At least for now.

00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:07.201
This is a morning show, so that's the sort of things that we have on a morning show, you know?

00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:07.301
Yeah.

00:32:08.942 --> 00:32:12.123
I guess you could submit them with the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:12.904
If you'd like to.

00:32:14.144 --> 00:32:16.845
If you think you can be up to the task.

00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:18.286
If you can handle that!

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:19.026
Yeah.

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:22.208
Well, Moco-chan, let's share what's next then.

00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:30.553
Our next stream coming up is... De-den!

00:32:31.593 --> 00:32:33.974
Well, this isn't today.

00:32:34.074 --> 00:32:38.514
Tonight we're gonna be taking the evening to focus on some of our homework.

00:32:38.994 --> 00:32:42.975
But we'll be back tomorrow for Fall Guys together with the Doggy Pack.

00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:44.495
That's okay, right, Moco-chan?

00:32:44.615 --> 00:32:45.716
Maybe that's okay.

00:32:45.736 --> 00:32:47.016
Together with the Doggy Pack.

00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:50.036
You know, it was so much fun last time, right?

00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:50.457
It was.

00:32:50.837 --> 00:32:51.477
You know?

00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:52.257
It was.

00:32:52.377 --> 00:32:52.817
Yeah, so...

00:32:53.197 --> 00:32:58.359
Ruffians, you know, if you weren't able to join, please grab Fall Guys, it's free!

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:00.960
And then that way we can play all together!

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.520
If you feel like it, I guess.

00:33:03.241 --> 00:33:10.083
It'd be a perfect time to grab the game and maybe if you're not part of the Doggy Pack yet, you could join and then, right?

00:33:10.103 --> 00:33:13.724
We can have some really chaotic and silly times all together tomorrow!

00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:17.346
Chaotic and silly in Fall Guys, not like the last question.

00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:18.046
Yeah.

00:33:18.066 --> 00:33:18.226
Yeah.

00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:22.110
We'll see you then, okay, Ruffians?

00:33:22.391 --> 00:33:23.011
Maybe.

00:33:23.812 --> 00:33:29.279
And we also have a recommendation, you know, since we're not gonna be live tonight.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.725
We recommend our most recent archive of our

00:33:34.005 --> 00:33:37.826
I keep talking and nobody explodes steam.

00:33:37.926 --> 00:33:46.287
I think, you know, what really stands out here is you can see just how well we worked together to smoothly defuse bombs, right?

00:33:46.447 --> 00:33:47.048
We did a good job.

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:48.888
We almost didn't need to say anything, right?

00:33:48.928 --> 00:33:49.908
We did a good job.

00:33:49.948 --> 00:33:50.348
Right?

00:33:52.189 --> 00:33:52.429
Right?

00:33:53.009 --> 00:33:54.049
Exactly like that.

00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:55.349
No chaos.

00:33:55.989 --> 00:33:56.590
No yelling.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.230
No anger.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.830
Nothing.

00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.507
BAU BAU!

00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:02.967
Do the homework!

00:34:15.504 --> 00:34:18.146
Do the homework that we haven't been able to do.

00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:20.748
So that we can do some really cool things in the future too.

00:34:20.768 --> 00:34:23.511
Put Money-chan's tears back into the eye socket.

00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:23.831
Yeah.

00:34:24.091 --> 00:34:24.812
Right back.

00:34:24.852 --> 00:34:25.933
Right with these paws.

00:34:26.013 --> 00:34:26.233
Yeah.

00:34:26.613 --> 00:34:26.933
Yeah.

00:34:27.574 --> 00:34:28.114
So, but!

00:34:28.314 --> 00:34:30.116
You know we have some really exciting things.

00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.978
We have a watch-along with all of Advent.

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:35.340
A rebroadcast of our Rawr Camp.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.342
We're finding it also short too!

00:34:37.422 --> 00:34:40.765
I would hope that the Ruffians are well behaved for the watch-along.

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:42.126
I think so.

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:43.247
Maybe.

00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:48.592
As long as you're not gonna ask Barbie any inappropriate questions either, huh?

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:49.073
Right.

00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:49.734
Yeah.

00:34:51.866 --> 00:34:52.086
Yup.

00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:59.047
Well, Ruffians, thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:34:59.067 --> 00:35:06.049
Our 41st FUWAMOCO Morning on our 101st day in hololive.

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:08.749
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:09.549
Thank you.

00:35:09.789 --> 00:35:17.191
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:19.729
Shiki.

00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:21.710
BAU BAU!

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.832

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:36:00.312 --> 00:36:03.774
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:07.475
