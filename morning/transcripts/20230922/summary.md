## Introduction (05:00)

## Mumei 3D Showcase (07:28)

FUWAMOCO are excited for the upcoming [Nanashi Mumei's 3D Showcase](https://youtu.be/HTgzc9_uAaY) (scheduled: 2023-09-23T19:00Z) and wonders what she will do. Will there be a horror segment?

## Bad News (08:58)

Alas, the lightbulb that Papa puppy had fixed [a few days before](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=9m54s) died again…

## Pero Update (10:47)

FUWAMOCO, with the help from their new fox friend Fubuki, [made it out of The Backrooms](https://youtu.be/WInHbCEsP8o)! To their surprise however, Pero was nowhere to be found there…

## Pero Sighting (14:05)

[ittikorn](https://twitter.com/ittikorn_th/status/1702711089652527217) reports that, instead of The Backrooms, Pero was roaming around the surface of Mars. FUWAMOCO wonders if that's a good place for him to be…

## Misunderstanding (16:28)

*Art by [yomomaru](https://twitter.com/yomomaru_08/status/1694305602368045402).* While it seemed that the [Cookie & Cream streams](https://youtu.be/FDxOHaixvQw) brought the worst of the Guard Dog Sisters as they were being mean to each other, FUWAMOCO assures Ruffians that they were just being silly: that's just how you play when you're as close to a person as siblings usually are!

## Confession (19:19)

*Art by [TomoYo619](https://twitter.com/TomoYo619/status/1704510744459415969).* FUWAMOCO confess that, even if it's not their intention usually, they have gone back to sleep a few times after FWMC Morning. They encourage Ruffians to do as they say, not as they do, and start off the day right away!

## Doggie of the Day (22:25)

[/V40](https://twitter.com/n_motoburger/status/1703795808972484932) shares a picture of a cute pupper having a nap (hopefully not just after FWMC Morning). With no name attached to the picture, FUWAMOCO along with the Ruffians suggest Nemu or Nemusuke. Mococo can't avoid getting a bit sleepy and [snoring](https://youtu.be/RDlng6GMJno?t=1448) with the image…

## Today I Went On A Walk (25:12)

[GD](https://twitter.com/MGDphau/status/1704533606243479796) takes a walk after rain with a beautiful rainbow in the background.

## Question Of The Day (26:25)

[Hanzla](https://twitter.com/darealhanz/status/1703470353563996506) asks what career FUWAMOCO would have pursued if they didn't become guard dogs. They assure us that they are very committed to being guard dogs, and it was their calling after all. That said, Fuwawa states that another option would have been getting into a business career, but the math required for that was a bit too hard for her.
