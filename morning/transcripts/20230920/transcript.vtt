00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.454
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:17.795
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:21.415
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.476
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:26.816
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:29.537
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:32.698
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:34.658
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:35.138 --> 00:05:38.039
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:45.627
Thank you for joining us today for a 20 second episode!

00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:46.528
Moco-chan, 22!

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:50.212
One two for me, one two for you.

00:05:51.473 --> 00:05:52.674
No two for the Ruffians.

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:58.641
I am already very... Moisturized!

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:00.482
Moisturized!

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:01.823
Yes!

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:03.163
Great start!

00:06:03.423 --> 00:06:04.924
Revenge!

00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:07.145
Well, Ruffians!

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:17.171
I think I saw a couple Ruffians talking about that maybe this was their first time today, so let us explain what FUWAMOCO Morning is all about!

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:24.757
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:24.837
A.K.A.

00:06:25.038 --> 00:06:26.139
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.083
Today is Wednesday and it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:35.928
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:45.215
Ruffians, if you could do us a favor and maybe tweet some of your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:46.896
That would make us really happy.

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:51.619
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.501
BAU BAU!

00:06:56.763 --> 00:07:01.025
And to start your day off, has another Ruffian seen Pero around?

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.727
I think so.

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:07.295
Where is he this time?

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:09.876
Pero!

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.757
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:16.177
Not again.

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:22.179
It looks like Pero was spotted somewhere very, very familiar again.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.199
Right, Moco-chan?

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.720
Do you know where this is?

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.200
No.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.660
Moco-chan, no don't you.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.681
No, I don't.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.641
Ruffians, you know, right?

00:07:32.362 --> 00:07:33.122
Moco-chan.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.250
I've never seen this place in my life.

00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:38.051
Uh-uh.

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:39.751
Wow.

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:44.852
You know, Ruffians, we originally went to this place.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.213
To, yeah.

00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:48.913
To the backrooms.

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:59.416
We went to the backrooms a few weeks ago after Pero was spotted there, but as you know, it didn't really work out as we had planned.

00:08:00.857 --> 00:08:01.317
Yeah.

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:01.757
Yeah.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:09.712
Maybe this is, you know, Pero's way of making a game out of things, you know?

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:11.073
It's not a game, though.

00:08:12.374 --> 00:08:13.794
To me, it's just mean.

00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:19.938
It's probably so that, you know, we become stronger guard dogs, right?

00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:21.581
I don't know.

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:31.525
This time, you know, we're going to be guided around by some of the best of the best, by Fubuki-senpai!

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.286
Yay!

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:41.769
You know, so not only can we try to want some more rescue Pero, but we gotta be extra brave, right Moco-chan?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.510
That way, Fubuki-senpai's impressed!

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:49.805
I don't think Hubuki-senpai is going to be impressed, but we can do our best, okay?

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:53.427
At least maybe the Ruffians will be impressed.

00:08:54.688 --> 00:08:55.789
Ruffians!

00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:59.151
Will you be impressed even if Hubuki-senpai isn't?

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:03.114
You have to say yes.

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:06.216
Yes?

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:06.536
No.

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:08.238
You have to say yes.

00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:08.698
I saw no.

00:09:08.878 --> 00:09:09.318
I saw no.

00:09:12.516 --> 00:09:15.798
Moco-chan, understand?

00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:23.503
This time, no complaining about being in pain or losing the feeling in your limbs.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:24.324
Okay?

00:09:24.644 --> 00:09:25.805
I can't promise that.

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.447
No, that's just going to be embarrassing otherwise.

00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:32.409
Fubuki-senpai's gonna think FUWAMOCO's weird.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.872
I think Fubuki-senpai will think that no matter what.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.293
BAU BAU!

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:43.456
Please, Ruffians, let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:45.778
Make sure you get a really good shot of him.

00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:50.120
Also, don't forget to use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.340
BAU BAU!

00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:55.804
Well, Ruffians!

00:09:56.124 --> 00:09:59.207
There's some really good, good, good news!

00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:00.087
Yeah!

00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:02.769
Oh, we talked about it before.

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:11.356
Maybe it's unexpected, but... Actually, we saw Papa Puppy very, very briefly.

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:20.220
Do you remember when we complained to you about how many FUWAMOCO it takes to replace a lightbulb?

00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:39.174
We still had one lightbulb that wasn't really working anymore.

00:10:39.314 --> 00:10:39.674
Yeah.

00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:49.360
So, you know we told Papa Puppy, uh, and, uh, because, you know, especially for me, the lightbulb was important.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.842
It kind of made things a little bit dangerous since it wasn't working anymore.

00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:55.023
It was in the kitchen, you know?

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.564
Yeah, so I was kind of chopping things up in the dark.

00:10:57.644 --> 00:10:58.265
I'm okay.

00:10:58.685 --> 00:10:59.185
I'm okay.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.206
I didn't hurt myself yet.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:00.566
No accidents.

00:11:00.986 --> 00:11:01.226
Yeah.

00:11:01.507 --> 00:11:02.027
Not like me.

00:11:08.518 --> 00:11:11.701
So imagine it's a Papa Puppy and you know what?

00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.804
You know what, Ruffians?

00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:18.187
Papa Puppy!

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:21.150
He just flicked the light and it was blinking again!

00:11:23.657 --> 00:11:25.739
I fixed it.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.342
We were like that in the dark for so long.

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:34.748
We're glad it was such a simple fix, but... It's a bit embarrassing too, you know?

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:35.749
Why?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.370
It didn't even need anything.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:37.811
Right?

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:41.034
I was chopping things up in the dark for no reason.

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:45.398
Why is it like that?

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:50.820
Maybe this is just part of Papa Puppy's duty, right?

00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:02.703
And that was it.

00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:04.403
Everything is good.

00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:08.745
Unfortunately, the good news ends there.

00:12:09.425 --> 00:12:09.845
Because...

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.172
Guardic Four Ruffians.

00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:15.334
Do you know what happened in Guardic Four?

00:12:15.814 --> 00:12:17.496
Guardic Four... Can you guess?

00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:22.753
It was a misunderstanding.

00:12:22.773 --> 00:12:24.693
A misunderstanding.

00:12:25.473 --> 00:12:26.134
Again!

00:12:26.154 --> 00:12:28.955
Again, Ruffians!

00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:34.116
We did our best, but maybe... Maybe it wasn't good enough this time.

00:12:35.897 --> 00:12:38.038
Doing Guarded Floor with Advent.

00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:40.318
Moco-chan!

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:41.899
Moco-chan here.

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:44.960
You made the mistake of implying that...

00:12:46.172 --> 00:12:52.274
Biboo has given, uh, can give birth to moai statues.

00:12:53.415 --> 00:13:02.278
Uh, and then, uh, uh, mistakenly, of course, Bijou then requested artists to get creative, uh, only to then realize her mistake.

00:13:02.318 --> 00:13:03.799
Yeah, I didn't mean anything.

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:07.220
Yeah, it's just all a big misunderstanding!

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.881
Yeah, okay!

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:12.182
Yeah, we thought, you know, that, uh, we would be okay this time, you know?

00:13:12.202 --> 00:13:13.183
I have confidence.

00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:13.763
But...

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.692
But we want you to understand one thing, Ruffians.

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:23.393
Moco-chan, I'm innocent.

00:13:24.093 --> 00:13:25.874
I'm just an innocent puppy.

00:13:26.174 --> 00:13:32.577
And Biboo... Biboo doesn't want everyone thinking about her giving birth to Moai statues.

00:13:32.957 --> 00:13:33.437
Okay?

00:13:34.038 --> 00:13:34.258
Nope.

00:13:35.018 --> 00:13:35.938
Understood?

00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:37.979
It's cancelled, okay?

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:41.881
I didn't mean to make anyone think about that sort of thing ever.

00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:42.681
You know it.

00:13:43.862 --> 00:13:44.962
It just wouldn't happen.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:47.516
I know.

00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:54.298
In fact, it's your fault for even thinking about it, okay?

00:13:54.758 --> 00:13:55.679
It's not mine.

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:56.879
Got it?

00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:58.840
I agree.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.560
Yeah.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.640
Ruffians, don't even think it.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.841
That thought, yeah.

00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.381
Canceled.

00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:04.201
You know it.

00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:05.942
It was just sort of implied.

00:14:05.982 --> 00:14:08.102
It wasn't me that made it happen, okay?

00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:08.822
It was you.

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:10.123
Yeah.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:11.316
Got it.

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:14.098
Misunderstanding?

00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:15.039
Yeah.

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:16.640
I didn't type anything.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.460
No.

00:14:18.141 --> 00:14:18.421
Yeah.

00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:19.482
Okay.

00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:21.663
Yeah.

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:22.624
Understood.

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:24.045
Understood.

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:25.666
BAU BAU.

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:26.386
Yeah.

00:14:26.506 --> 00:14:32.871
Okay, forget about that.

00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:36.193
I... Actually...

00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:48.764
A misunderstanding and apology!

00:14:49.204 --> 00:15:01.332
I know I thought we could do better, but... Ruffians... You know... Okay, well this is good then.

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:02.152
This is good.

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:06.475
That means that I really have to make an apology for this one then.

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:09.601
It's a good thing you're doing this.

00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:12.984
Doing a stream of Cookie and Cream yesterday.

00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:17.387
Ruffians, you might know, I got a bit heated.

00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:20.169
Just a bit.

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:21.330
Just a bit, right.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.212
The game was really tricky!

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:25.974
I didn't get heated at all.

00:15:26.074 --> 00:15:31.358
It wasn't my fault, you know, but I think I need to apologize for this one.

00:15:32.674 --> 00:15:38.636
Within my anger and my rage at the game, I said something that I shouldn't have.

00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:45.399
And I think I shocked not only a number of Ruffians, but also Moco-chan too, right?

00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:45.839
You did.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.000
I was very surprised, very disappointed.

00:15:51.361 --> 00:15:53.642
By accident, I might have...

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.113
I have said the D word.

00:15:58.493 --> 00:16:01.435
I called the boss a dude.

00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:03.117
I'm so sorry!

00:16:03.137 --> 00:16:07.460
Ruffians, will you forgive me?

00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:09.522
Will you forgive her, dude?

00:16:09.542 --> 00:16:15.387
Moco-chan, we're gonna have to apologize for you too.

00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:19.882
Continue.

00:16:21.503 --> 00:16:25.025
Ruffians, you don't think any differently of me now, right?

00:16:25.045 --> 00:16:27.987
Your image hasn't been solid or anything, right?

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.069
Not forever and ever, right?

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:36.553
You know, it's just that he was moving so slowly and we didn't have much time left.

00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:38.354
It was his fault, okay?

00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:39.214
Yeah, I know.

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:46.099
So, I really wanted him to hurry up and that's what I might have shouted, Hurry up, dude!

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.360
Yeah.

00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:49.265
It makes sense.

00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:50.626
It was his fault, okay?

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.366
I'm sorry, Ruffians!

00:16:52.606 --> 00:16:56.267
Next time, I'll make sure to call him Mr. instead, okay?

00:16:56.327 --> 00:16:58.767
Yeah, Mr. Mr. Boss.

00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:02.308
Mr., if you could, uh, please, please move on.

00:17:02.368 --> 00:17:03.709
A little more spryly!

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:04.329
Yeah!

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:05.769
Mr.!

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.630
That's what I'll say to him, okay?

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.470
Okay.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.690
Sorry again, Ruffians.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.151
Apology accepted.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.171
Not Mr. It's okay.

00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:24.292
Okay.

00:17:24.712 --> 00:17:25.532
Accepted.

00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:27.953
Thank goodness.

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:29.773
The Ruffians are kind.

00:17:30.934 --> 00:17:33.694
Very accepting of Fuwawa's flaws.

00:17:33.774 --> 00:17:36.515
Please don't think any different of me, okay?

00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:38.256
BAU BAU!

00:17:43.886 --> 00:17:47.555
Next we actually have a special surprise.

00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:54.014
What is it, Moco-chan?

00:17:54.894 --> 00:17:58.197
We noticed a surprise today on Twitter!

00:17:58.898 --> 00:18:00.619
Ruffians, did you see it?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.865
We saw that Parkour-sensei drew a very special picture of Moco-chan!

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.627
But this isn't just Moco-chan.

00:18:10.828 --> 00:18:13.109
It's Nice Witch Mococo!

00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:18.952
How did you know it?

00:18:19.492 --> 00:18:19.912
Why?

00:18:20.252 --> 00:18:21.192
It's so cute!

00:18:21.232 --> 00:18:22.873
Many times she's Moco-chan.

00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:25.553
How did you... She's a magical girl.

00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:26.333
Like Koubeki-chan!

00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:27.714
Right, right!

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.914
Moco-chan, what would your magical spell be?

00:18:29.974 --> 00:18:30.454
Ruffians!

00:18:30.494 --> 00:18:33.895
Moco Moco Fuwa Fuwa Violence!

00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:37.996
With that... I don't know.

00:18:45.698 --> 00:18:49.760
I'm gonna protect your smile whether you like it or not!

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.561
That's one Moco-chan like, I think.

00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:53.262
That's Moco-chan like, what is it?

00:18:53.602 --> 00:18:56.003
I'm gonna switch.

00:18:56.183 --> 00:18:58.164
Moco-chan.

00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:58.644
Thank you!

00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:00.825
Thank you!

00:19:00.845 --> 00:19:03.947
Sneeze magic.

00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:06.668
That's not that reliable though, is it?

00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:07.389
A beam.

00:19:07.409 --> 00:19:09.069
Sneeze beam.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.570
Sneeze cannon.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.131
Hanakara beam.

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.837
You know, one of these days we really need to sing I Know Medicine.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:19.998
Right?

00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:22.080
Okay, right!

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.042
Hopefully we can someday soon!

00:19:25.142 --> 00:19:28.726
Thank you, Paco-sensei!

00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:29.286
BAU BAU!

00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:32.109
Thank you!

00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:34.131
That's a wonderful surprise, right Moco-chan?

00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:34.471
Right!

00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:37.674
Please charge rifle.

00:19:37.694 --> 00:19:39.896
Do magical girls have rifles?

00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:44.104
Depends on the magical girl, I guess.

00:19:44.404 --> 00:19:45.065
What?

00:19:47.847 --> 00:19:51.310
I did... I did want to say something.

00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:52.611
Something?

00:19:56.594 --> 00:20:00.918
You know... I said that I wouldn't do it every week.

00:20:01.878 --> 00:20:05.541
But... I felt like you called for it, okay?

00:20:06.322 --> 00:20:06.682
So you...

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:09.259
Ruffians!

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.680
Hi!

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.201
Listen up!

00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:13.542
Okay, are you listening?

00:20:14.503 --> 00:20:15.303
Are you listening?

00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:20.067
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:20:20.867 --> 00:20:24.190
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.411
You know it.

00:20:26.844 --> 00:20:27.584
You're here!

00:20:28.245 --> 00:20:30.845
And I know you're a bit sleepy, but you're doing it!

00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:35.527
Even though it's rough, you got going for a new day!

00:20:36.147 --> 00:20:37.907
And you know that's already half the battle!

00:20:38.768 --> 00:20:44.349
No matter how much gets piled onto you, you continue through and you're able to keep going!

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.590
You know.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.791
Why are you so amazing?

00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:54.073
Even if things don't get going your way, you get back up and do your best.

00:20:54.773 --> 00:20:55.994
And you know what that means?

00:20:56.574 --> 00:20:58.575
That means you're unstoppable!

00:20:59.396 --> 00:20:59.776
Okay.

00:21:00.616 --> 00:21:05.399
So, for a moment, let's just stop and take a deep breath together, okay?

00:21:05.419 --> 00:21:07.079
Breathe with me.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:16.079
3... 2... 1...

00:21:17.263 --> 00:21:19.009
You can do it!

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.577
Hopefully I got the sleepy out of you now.

00:21:23.672 --> 00:21:24.653
You got this today!

00:21:24.673 --> 00:21:25.974
And you know what?

00:21:26.454 --> 00:21:30.397
We'll get a good sleep later and properly recharge your batteries, so don't worry!

00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:32.818
Make sure you remember.

00:21:32.838 --> 00:21:34.420
I believe in you!

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.261
Fuwawa believes in you!

00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:40.424
Pero probably believes in you, or he should at least.

00:21:42.265 --> 00:21:44.106
We'll make it through together!

00:21:44.146 --> 00:21:45.748
Ganbatte ne!

00:21:45.808 --> 00:21:46.308
BAU BAU!

00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:49.490
BAU BAU!

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:57.261
I believe in you Ruffians.

00:21:57.982 --> 00:21:59.503
Hopefully Pero does too though.

00:21:59.563 --> 00:22:00.244
Hopefully.

00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:02.306
I don't know though, I can't speak for him.

00:22:02.426 --> 00:22:09.012
I'm gonna believe in Pero that hopefully believes in you.

00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:09.632
Moco-chan!

00:22:09.692 --> 00:22:13.796
Should we go and see who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:22:13.936 --> 00:22:16.979
It is... It's Chame!

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.492
What are you doing there, Chame?

00:22:22.512 --> 00:22:23.492
Did you fall asleep?

00:22:23.772 --> 00:22:24.712
Very comfy.

00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:28.474
It seems like Chame fell asleep between the sliding doors.

00:22:29.654 --> 00:22:31.155
But don't worry, Ruffians.

00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:34.116
That's pretty normal for him from the sounds of things.

00:22:34.176 --> 00:22:35.617
Maybe he just worked really hard.

00:22:35.637 --> 00:22:37.057
He really barked up a storm.

00:22:37.077 --> 00:22:37.618
Maybe.

00:22:38.118 --> 00:22:38.498
I don't know.

00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.519
I think it's more that Chame's just chilly.

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:43.900
It's really cute though!

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.482
Ruffians, do you ever feel like this?

00:22:46.662 --> 00:22:48.743
Or you just fall asleep in between the door?

00:22:49.823 --> 00:22:51.104
Just like that.

00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:52.845
Sometimes you just can't help it.

00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:55.586
Sometimes, you know.

00:22:56.407 --> 00:22:58.608
But sometimes you should be careful, you know?

00:22:58.668 --> 00:22:59.928
It's important to be careful.

00:22:59.948 --> 00:23:00.068
Safety.

00:23:02.009 --> 00:23:06.852
I just remember the time that I kind of closed my tail in the door.

00:23:07.632 --> 00:23:08.973
It was the worst.

00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:10.093
I'm better than that.

00:23:12.321 --> 00:23:16.322
Chame, please be maybe a little bit more mindful, okay?

00:23:16.342 --> 00:23:17.703
Yeah, no injuries.

00:23:18.003 --> 00:23:18.723
All safety.

00:23:20.084 --> 00:23:22.244
Moco-chan, how does Chame BAU BAU?

00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:24.605
I think he's a light.

00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:26.926
Cute and light BAU BAU.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:28.086
Light?

00:23:28.887 --> 00:23:31.968
But sort of, I don't know, maybe a bit impatient.

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:32.768
Impatient?

00:23:32.868 --> 00:23:34.129
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:37.130
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.090
I think that's exactly it!

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.871
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:41.716 --> 00:23:41.897
Chame!

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:44.865
Chame's a silly best friend.

00:23:48.353 --> 00:23:48.553
BAU BAU!

00:23:48.573 --> 00:23:49.033
Thank you!

00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:22.216
Is there a Ruffian that went on a walk?

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:25.778
Ruffians, you've been going out for a walk, right?

00:24:25.818 --> 00:24:27.659
Today we have... De-den!

00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:33.163
An Apple Orchard!

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:37.566
That's so sweet that you went on a walk around an Apple Orchard with your friends.

00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:41.569
That's definitely sweet because of all the apples, too.

00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:41.849
Nice.

00:24:44.892 --> 00:24:46.597
Could you eat them from the trees?

00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:48.122
I wonder.

00:24:48.182 --> 00:24:49.366
Is that allowed anymore?

00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:50.770
Is that gonna be yummy though?

00:24:51.392 --> 00:24:51.914
Why not?

00:24:54.482 --> 00:24:56.544
Ruffians, have you done this too before?

00:24:56.564 --> 00:25:01.508
It looks like this Ruffian picked Honeycrisp Apples.

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:03.750
Are you going to make anything with them?

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.412
Like pies?

00:25:05.452 --> 00:25:06.653
Or applesauce?

00:25:06.953 --> 00:25:09.255
I want to make a pie with them!

00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:12.918
It's really fun picking fresh berries, right Moco-chan?

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:13.859
I like that a lot.

00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:14.499
It's fun.

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:18.062
Do you remember that one time that we picked the blackberries?

00:25:19.244 --> 00:25:20.245
What did we make with them?

00:25:20.846 --> 00:25:21.647
We made jam!

00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:22.949
Right!

00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:23.269
Right?

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:27.074
With wild blackberries that were growing in the Northwest Passage?

00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:27.634
Yeah.

00:25:27.955 --> 00:25:30.959
And we gave them to Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy?

00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:31.239
Yeah.

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:32.681
That was just too much jam.

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:39.229
We hope you enjoy the apples lots and lots.

00:25:39.249 --> 00:25:40.591
It was a lot of fun.

00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:42.212
I would like to do that too.

00:25:42.232 --> 00:25:43.814
It sounds great.

00:25:44.054 --> 00:25:45.516
Apple picking with the Ruffians.

00:25:45.596 --> 00:25:47.558
BAU BAU!

00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:52.517
And today we have a question!

00:25:52.757 --> 00:25:57.080
Question of the Day is... Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.341
Hello!

00:25:58.781 --> 00:26:08.747
I was wondering if you have any specific rituals or practices that you do to relax when you're nervous before doing something big like an interview or presentation?

00:26:08.888 --> 00:26:09.808
Good question.

00:26:11.809 --> 00:26:17.493
I think you know after all that guard dog training, we don't really get that nervous anymore.

00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:18.054
Maybe.

00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:25.275
But when we're feeling a little bit anxious about something, we like to go on a good walk beforehand.

00:26:25.315 --> 00:26:26.636
Yeah, a walk is always good.

00:26:26.736 --> 00:26:30.659
It brings good energy, good luck, you know, calm you down.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.062
Everything's clear, you know, it helps a lot.

00:26:34.122 --> 00:26:42.388
But we also like stretching or other exercise too, but if we really just don't have the time for that, we have another secret.

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:43.068
A secret.

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.629
Okay.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.671
Ruffians, can you guess?

00:26:47.091 --> 00:26:47.211
Oh.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.625
Non veritas.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.722
We hate each other!

00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:07.447
For example, if Moco-chan's really nervous, then I'll rub her back all over.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:08.908
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

00:27:09.008 --> 00:27:10.649
And then I give her a big whack!

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.353
It gets all the nerves out, you know it!

00:27:16.473 --> 00:27:20.116
It maybe sounds a bit strange, but it does really work.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:23.218
Sometimes it leaves a bit of a woe, but it's okay.

00:27:23.238 --> 00:27:24.760
Moco-chan, you'll do it for me, too.

00:27:26.901 --> 00:27:30.869
That might have been what we were doing a bunch before we debuted, right?

00:27:30.889 --> 00:27:31.571
Right, right.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:42.413
Also, in extreme cases, Amoco-chan likes to just lay down flat on the ground and breathe like in a starfish position.

00:27:42.633 --> 00:27:42.933
Yeah.

00:27:43.153 --> 00:27:49.335
Yeah, it's kind of weird, but... But hopefully, Ruffians, that can help you.

00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:59.699
If you ever feel nervous before a big presentation, you just need to find somebody to rub your back and then give it a big... As hard as they can.

00:28:00.739 --> 00:28:02.721
It works well, okay?

00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:04.802
BAU BAU!

00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:08.184
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for your submissions always.

00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:18.431
As you know, we're still looking for more Pero Sightings, Doggie of the Day questions, and we want to hear more from you about the kind of walks you're going on too.

00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:24.616
So please submit them with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.303
BAU BAU!

00:28:28.323 --> 00:28:30.268
Moco-chan, what's our next dream?

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.792
Our next dream is...

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.601
De-den!

00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:37.323
We're playing Super Smash Bros.

00:28:37.343 --> 00:28:38.944
with Calli-senpai!

00:28:39.224 --> 00:28:42.566
The tails are going right against the sides, right?

00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:47.469
Ruffians, do you have any good strategies for us?

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.331
Or like anything we can do to make Calli-senpai laugh?

00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:52.673
Do you want to know a secret?

00:28:54.294 --> 00:28:56.995
I thought we were playing Super Smash Bros.

00:28:57.075 --> 00:28:57.476
Brawl.

00:28:58.016 --> 00:28:58.196
No.

00:28:58.957 --> 00:28:59.997
It's Ultimate now.

00:29:00.518 --> 00:29:00.598
Oh.

00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:06.149
That sounds easier said than done.

00:29:25.092 --> 00:29:27.614
I have a feeling it's not us.

00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:55.448
Ah.

00:29:56.193 --> 00:29:56.616
Not us.

00:29:57.301 --> 00:29:57.562
The who.

00:29:59.318 --> 00:30:00.778
Let's do our best!

00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:02.679
BAU BAU!

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:05.640
Let's take another peek at our schedule.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:12.462
After our collab with Calli-senpai, will be our first collab with Fubuki-senpai!

00:30:12.482 --> 00:30:17.904
We're super excited of course, but also a bit nervous too.

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:23.565
Please Ruffians, please be there to hold our paws for a lot of different reasons.

00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:38.213
After, you know, after we kinda get to the backrooms of Fubuki-senpai, hopefully we find Pero, it's gonna be okay because we're gonna have ton of fun playing Ocarina of Time!

00:30:38.593 --> 00:30:44.416
And then, after that, it's another Rock'n'Rawr Party!

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:46.297
Yeah, we're gonna be rocking out!

00:30:46.717 --> 00:30:50.139
And this time, the theme's been decided.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.120
Huh?

00:30:52.110 --> 00:31:00.490
Well, Ruffians, I'm just gonna say, you might not need a time machine to feel like you've gone back in time this time.

00:31:00.531 --> 00:31:01.373
That's a lot of time.

00:31:02.782 --> 00:31:03.723
BAU BAU!

00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:05.785
Thank you!

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:11.170
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.151
Thank you!

00:31:12.631 --> 00:31:20.138
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:21.579
Full Assist!

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.821
BAU BAU!

00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:26.344
Pirate Pete!

00:31:26.364 --> 00:31:26.504
BAU BAU!

00:31:27.064 --> 00:31:27.405
Speaker!

00:31:27.465 --> 00:31:28.206
BAU BAU!

00:31:29.206 --> 00:31:38.172
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:41.855
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:59.631 --> 00:32:00.637
BAU BAU BAU BAU!
