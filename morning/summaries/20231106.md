[LoneBushido](https://twitter.com/FlameBushidoNo1/status/1719017559758889107) found Pero while trying out their new FUWAMOCO bowling ball.

Their training bore fruits, and FUWAMOCO along with the Red Team achieved victory in the [Minecraft Sports Festival 2023](https://youtu.be/QBMF6LN1QyU)!

## 🙊 Confession ([10:37](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=10m37s))

Even though she wasn't participating, Fuwawa was able to support Mococo by allowing her to use her arm as a hand rest. It seems that it worked out and allowed Moco-chan to rest her hands properly.

## ⛏️ Minecraft Photo ([13:06](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=13m06s))

In the end however, the twins were able to take a [picture together](https://twitter.com/FUWAMOCO_en/status/1720788581801976235/photo/1)! Papa puppy gave them a laptop that, although old, allowed Fuwawa to join Mococo in their victory celebration.

## ❌ Misunderstanding ([15:12](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=15m12s))

No misunderstandings today! Ruffians are shocked.

## 🎞️ Goodbye Daylight Time ([16:27](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=16m27s))

Aligned with the U.S. and Canada, clocks in the Northwest Passage went back 1 hour, causing FUWAMOCO's stream schedule to shift as well. The sisters apologize for the inconvenience this might cause to Ruffians not observing Daylight Time changes.

FUWAMOCO joined Haachama during her [call-in stream](https://youtu.be/_U--hP9-WyY?t=4480)!

## 📻 VR Radio ([20:45](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=20m45s))

FUWAMOCO's Opening Song, ["Lifetime Showtime"](https://youtu.be/-wzgy7uTuSk), was [broadcasted on NHK's ぶいあーる！～VTuberの音楽Radio～](https://twitter.com/nhk_vtuberradio/status/1721173523614298148)!

## 🏆 Natto Challenge ([22:32](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=22m32s))

To change things up, Mococo tried dry natto for today's challenge. [It doesn't make a difference on her disdain...](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=1596)

## ❓ Question Of The Day ([32:33](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=32m33s))

[@rotflolmaomgeez](https://twitter.com/rotflolmaomgeez/status/1719874170618589195) ask if FUWAMOCO have any rituals before or after a stream? On FWMC Morning days, they wake up early and get prepared (see [ep. 33](https://youtu.be/f270ObaKNZw?t=1834)). They also use to be on Twitter before and after a stream.
