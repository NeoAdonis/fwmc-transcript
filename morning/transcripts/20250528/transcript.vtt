00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:17.969
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.578
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.425
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.248
I'm not Fuwawa!

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.192
I'm Mococo!

00:05:31.452 --> 00:05:35.439
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.700
BAU BAU!

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.048
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:45.898
Thank you for joining us for our 160th episode today!

00:05:47.922 --> 00:05:48.122
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:50.607
Good morning FUWAMOCO Good Morning!

00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:51.709
I feel like I sound like a...

00:05:52.803 --> 00:06:08.382
I feel like I sound like that.

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:13.468
That's a little bit too much for the mornings, Moco-chan.

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.993
BAU BAU!

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.443
Good morning, Ruffians.

00:06:24.212 --> 00:06:26.657
BAU BAU!

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:29.522
Thank you Ruffians for joining us.

00:06:29.903 --> 00:06:35.793
For Ruffians who are joining us for the first time, I saw some Ruffians happy that they're able to wake up earlier time.

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:39.539
Congratulations!

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:40.881
But some explanation is in order.

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:42.604
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:47.431
It's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:48.733
A.K.A.

00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:49.073
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:52.098
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.305
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:57.886
Yes!

00:06:58.187 --> 00:07:04.155
Now, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:04.576 --> 00:07:08.141
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.503
BAU BAU!

00:07:09.483 --> 00:07:11.145
Come morning.

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:12.986
You woke up a bit early for this.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.448
Come morning.

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.030
You're awake and now you're not going back to sleep, okay?

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.413
Good.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:20.714
Okay.

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:22.556
BAU BAU.

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:25.618
Well, you know, there's been a bunch of things going on.

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:27.020
Exciting things.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.523
Maybe we can share them with the Ruffians right away here, Moco-chan.

00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:37.650
I don't know if that's that exciting though, Moco-chan.

00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:40.479
You woke up 10 minutes ago.

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:41.220
Maybe not.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.041
Good morning!

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:42.962
10 minutes ago.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.849
Maybe not, maybe I'm glitchy.

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:48.851
Let's go right into it then, Moco-chan!

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.474
Oh my god, she avoided!

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:59.947
Is what I would like to say, but uh... Unfortunately it's not.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:04.132
Don't tell me there's been a parasite in Moco-chan.

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:07.317
Ruffians!

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:15.413
There's been another Pero Sighting!

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:18.198
Moco-chan, let's just take a look so that we can know what to avoid.

00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:20.824
You know, the Ruffians, they woke up at 5.30am!

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:24.992
They just need to know and get on with their days.

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:26.735
Well, here we go.

00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:32.908
Where is Pero Sighting?

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:33.068
De-den!

00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:42.653
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:42.802 --> 00:09:03.734
I thought you said tasty but you wrote nasty.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.637
Did you make a typo?

00:09:05.617 --> 00:09:07.780
Tasty and nasty are pretty similar.

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:09.723
Thank you for the food!

00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:14.389
Look, I'm sure it's delicious once you cut into it, you know?

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.550
It's not filled with muscle.

00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:21.599
No, I'm sure it's filled with sprinkles or something or a strawberry paste or something, you know?

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:22.259
Yeah?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.462
Not strawberry jam, strawberry paste.

00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:25.644
Paste.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:25.764
Yeah.

00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:27.647
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:33.234
You know, when you make a cake, don't you think it tastes way better because you had a bunch of fun making it?

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:33.835
Yeah!

00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:36.980
Ruffians, you have made a cake before, right?

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.077
Right?

00:09:39.097 --> 00:09:39.218
Right?

00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:42.947
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:45.130
Yeah, no.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.351
No.

00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:49.595
It's not too late to make a cake, you know what?

00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:51.898
Actually, you can make a mug cake, too.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.519
Yes, yes!

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:57.024
You can have some flour, and an egg, and some butter, and you just mix it together.

00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:59.968
And vanilla, and maybe some sugar.

00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:00.669
Stuff.

00:10:00.689 --> 00:10:03.112
Yeah, then you can make a mug cake, and that's a cake.

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:04.193
Does cake mix count?

00:10:04.213 --> 00:10:04.534
Yes.

00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:06.336
That counts, yes.

00:10:06.316 --> 00:10:24.088
Monkeys count.

00:10:25.655 --> 00:10:27.197
But it's a good start, that's the important thing.

00:10:27.237 --> 00:10:28.458
It's a good start, yeah.

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:28.759
Yeah.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.622
Start at the one cake, then continue on.

00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:35.827
But such an amazing pero cake!

00:10:36.247 --> 00:10:39.591
I hope you enjoyed it with a bunch of friends, you know?

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:40.071
Yeah!

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:40.472
Yeah.

00:10:42.154 --> 00:10:44.396
BAU BAU!

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:44.937
BAU BAU!

00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:45.598
I like this, you know?

00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:48.140
Ruffians best pero cakes too, you know?

00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:51.064
More pero cakes, less Pero Sightings.

00:10:52.946 --> 00:10:53.046
Yeah.

00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:57.108
BAU BAU!

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.572
BAU BAU!

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:00.873
BAU BAU!

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:03.576
BAU BAU!

00:11:03.657 --> 00:11:05.919
BAU BAU!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.087
BAU BAU!

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:14.670
BAU BAU!

00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:17.394
BAU BAU!

00:11:18.034 --> 00:11:22.560
BAU BAU!

00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:25.911
Okayu-senpai!

00:11:25.931 --> 00:11:30.595
She just finished her second solo concert at Kaya Arena!

00:11:31.055 --> 00:11:34.078
It was her first solo concert in three years!

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.103
Nice transition.

00:11:39.123 --> 00:11:40.344
BAU BAU!

00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:41.686
Poison.

00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:42.586
Nya.

00:11:42.606 --> 00:11:43.788
Respect.

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:44.468
Person.

00:11:44.488 --> 00:11:44.989
Nya.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.312
Respect.

00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:52.716
Poison.

00:11:52.696 --> 00:11:55.600
BAU BAU!

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:12.082
But in the key visual here you can see a very, very outdoors, wild Okayu-senpai.

00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:13.203
Yeah, because she has a new outfit!

00:12:13.223 --> 00:12:13.484
A new outfit!

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:13.724
Look at it!

00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:13.964
It's fuzzy!

00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:14.305
Yeah, long hair!

00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:15.006
A bit wild looking.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.589
The tail's a little bit longer.

00:12:17.609 --> 00:12:18.130
I can't see it that well.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.876
She has some ouchies on her tummy, but that's okay.

00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:23.181
She might have gotten some bites or something.

00:12:23.622 --> 00:12:24.625
Wild cat.

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:26.288
Outdoors cat.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.170
Okayu-senpai.

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:29.255
She had a summer concert.

00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:30.077
Yeah!

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:34.667
You know, FUWAMOCO, we did a watchabong too, so...

00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:38.112
Well, friends, if you're curious about it, you can catch it on SPWX.

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:40.015
It's streaming to get there.

00:12:40.035 --> 00:12:42.278
There will be an archive available for about a month.

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:42.959
But!

00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:44.581
You can watch it together with us.

00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:50.270
There is also a free sneak peek over on Okayu-senpai's channel.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.332
So please check it out if you're curious as well.

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.476
You know what, it's a solo concert, right?

00:12:54.596 --> 00:12:58.561
You know, it's a little bit different than the 3D concert, you know?

00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:01.586
Look at all the onigiri out there!

00:13:02.307 --> 00:13:02.427
Right.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:09.578
But it was really amazing, you know, Okayu-senpai, she sang a bunch of her new songs and older songs too!

00:13:09.698 --> 00:13:10.800
Yeah, we were surprised!

00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:16.449
Right, you know, and it was just a very, very, like, well-rounded act.

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.370
Very Okayu-senpai.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.415
Oh, you know, you got to know every little bit of her.

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:22.257
I feel like she performed so many songs!

00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:23.019
Right!

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.883
It was just to the point where I feel like...

00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:28.288
Do I-senpai always sing that many songs?

00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:35.183
You'll definitely check out the free version!

00:13:35.203 --> 00:13:44.243
15 minutes of a sneak peek into the concert and if you're like, I want to get to know Okayu-senpai even more, you can check it out on SPWN.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:45.885
We just really, really loved it.

00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:59.800
You know, solo concerts are such a special, special thing that our senpai have been able to do, so we're really happy to be able to see that moment, you know?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.863
And you know, we'll continue to work hard towards our dream of one day having a FUWAMOCO solo concert!

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:09.031
I hope that our delusional solo concert, Moco-chan, that we can have it so it's super fluffy and super fuzzy, you know?

00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:10.933
I get FUWAMOCO now.

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:12.154
Yeah.

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.495
I would like that, you know?

00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:14.616
Maybe!

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:15.938
Maybe!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.302
You know, somebody watching goes, I don't really know who FUWAMOCO are.

00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:22.724
But I'll check this out, it seems fun.

00:14:23.164 --> 00:14:26.467
And then after that, oh, now I understand.

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:31.352
Thank you, Okayu-senpai!

00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:33.854
Congratulations!

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:34.035
BAU BAU!

00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:39.960
I'm looking forward to seeing more of her cute new outfits too, right?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.180
BAU BAU!

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.321
So what do you think, Ruffians?

00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:41.922
Do we have

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:49.762
Wild dog FUWAMOCO outfits.

00:14:49.782 --> 00:14:51.547
You know what's even cooler than a wild dog?

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:53.793
Demon dog.

00:14:56.341 --> 00:14:58.206
Unless he's just everyday.

00:14:58.962 --> 00:15:01.928
BAU BAU!

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:11.087
Continuing about this concert, FUWAMOCO, we just got back from our concert at Anime Boys 2!

00:15:11.107 --> 00:15:12.731
BAU BAU!

00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.857
Together with B-senpai, we performed at

00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:20.024
Anyway Boston, for the hololive meet super karaoke party!

00:15:20.284 --> 00:15:23.009
It was the first ever event like this in the US.

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:23.910
Yes!

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.753
It was super duper fun!

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:28.397
We were so nervous though!

00:15:28.418 --> 00:15:29.800
Unbelievably nervous!

00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:34.407
Yeah, we were shaking a little bit beforehand, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:35.249
Unbelievably nervous!

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.377
Yeah, but you know, Okayu-senpai talked about eating bento.

00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:43.598
I had the fish out of the bento.

00:15:43.618 --> 00:15:45.581
I did not even bother touching the bento.

00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:49.086
No.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:50.147
Fish energy.

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:53.632
No.

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:54.914
Yeah, Moco-chan was brave.

00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:56.316
I did not.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:16:04.648
I thought maybe, worst case scenario, I might throw up the fish, but... That was the risk you're gonna take, Moco-chan!

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:05.790
Yes.

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:08.371
It didn't happen, so yay.

00:16:09.714 --> 00:16:14.381
But you know, we did sing a bunch of songs and danced a number of them too!

00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:24.656
Classic anime songs, city pop songs, and of course hololive songs, including our very own original Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★!

00:16:24.677 --> 00:16:27.521
I think the Ruffians really liked that one, huh?

00:16:28.282 --> 00:16:29.584
One Ruffian.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.495
I cried a lot.

00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:37.565
But it was happy tears though.

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:42.561
Because it was happy tears, I felt a bit proud.

00:16:43.402 --> 00:17:07.890
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.835
We're watching when you're waving the camera because you're- Oh, I'm being silly.

00:17:12.475 --> 00:17:14.017
We're waving back at you.

00:17:14.057 --> 00:17:24.449
But we are just so so happy to be able to hear your voices and see your smiles, too, Ruffians.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.215
You know, it's always hard to say goodbye at the end of a performance.

00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:31.617
What?

00:17:31.934 --> 00:17:36.040
You know, maybe sometimes we don't have to say hello.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.866
Right, because I shall be saying hello again!

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:40.447
Soon!

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:48.759
Because, well, Ruffians, you might have heard that there's going to be a hololive World Tour going on!

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.841
Yes!

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.104
Yeah, the hololive Stage World Tour "Synchronize!"

00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:56.471
A new tour is setting sail this year too!

00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:56.811
With this big...

00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:57.412
Cool!

00:17:57.513 --> 00:17:58.675
Cute!

00:17:58.695 --> 00:17:58.936
Amazing!

00:17:58.956 --> 00:17:59.698
Synchronize!

00:18:00.239 --> 00:18:01.863
Key visual here!

00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:05.491
And this year, compared to last year, we have a new tour!

00:18:05.511 --> 00:18:07.836
Last year we have Calli-senpai!

00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:09.520
Nenechi-senpai!

00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:10.583
Ollie-senpai!

00:18:10.783 --> 00:18:11.765
IRyS-senpai!

00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:13.389
And Nerissa!

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.732
Not senpai.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:15.053
No.

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:21.905
You know and it's a world tour so we're gonna be making a bunch of stops across all the places.

00:18:22.365 --> 00:18:28.436
Sydney, New York, Kuala Lumpur, a bunch of bunch of places.

00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:30.880
But you know a tour also needs special guests.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.322
Special guests, right?

00:18:32.342 --> 00:18:40.236
And FUWAMOCO, we are now the special guests of the Vancouver Storm Adventure!

00:18:40.256 --> 00:18:40.416
BAU BAU!

00:18:41.527 --> 00:18:56.548
It's the best time for living in Canada!

00:18:56.528 --> 00:19:04.036
It's our first time, so... We'll be at Anime Revolution on August 3rd!

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:07.580
So we hope that you'll be able to come and see us there, Ruffians!

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:07.741
Yeah!

00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:09.002
Are you going?

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:09.903
Yeah!

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:13.327
We saw some Ruffians already have their tickets!

00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:14.448
We'll see you there then!

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:17.011
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:20.115
Are you gonna be at the New York City show?

00:19:20.455 --> 00:19:23.578
How fun!

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:25.000
We won't be there though.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:30.354
But you'll have fun, that's the number one thing, you know?

00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:39.337
You know, maybe Canada's a little bit far for some Ruffians, but... But there's other stuff coming too, I'm sure!

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:39.838
Yeah, you do!

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:40.440
So maybe I'll be...

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.344
Come to where you are, soon!

00:19:43.364 --> 00:19:45.146
It just has to get announced though, maybe?

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:47.209
Oh, there's other stuff there.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:54.778
Please continue to look forward to more announcements from the hololive STAGE World Tour "Synchronize!"

00:19:55.279 --> 00:20:01.166
And Ruffians, you better be ready to synchronize with us too!

00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:02.568
BAU BAU!

00:20:02.588 --> 00:20:06.713
Do you think maybe they chose us for this because of our skills?

00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:09.837
The skills that we synchronize?

00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:13.458
We didn't synchronize just now, so... We did just now.

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:14.339
When?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.143
When we said "synchronize."

00:20:16.303 --> 00:20:16.644
When?

00:20:17.245 --> 00:20:17.706
Just now.

00:20:17.886 --> 00:20:19.970
I don't... Did you say "synchronize?"

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.351
I did.

00:20:20.992 --> 00:20:21.553
Did she?

00:20:22.816 --> 00:20:26.142
Synchronize... Didn't synchronize then.

00:20:26.824 --> 00:20:27.645
Synchronize.

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:28.146
Nope.

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:29.188
Nope, not then.

00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:30.110
I can't do it!

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:30.511
I'm not good at it!

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:30.771
Synchronize.

00:20:31.894 --> 00:20:32.635
We did.

00:20:33.172 --> 00:20:35.355
Yes!

00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:36.176
I don't know.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.483
Synchronize!

00:20:41.563 --> 00:20:42.204
BAU BAU!

00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:44.146
BAU BAU!

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:44.527
Synchronize!

00:20:45.989 --> 00:20:49.413
I can't force it.

00:20:51.195 --> 00:20:51.836
BAU BAU!

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:56.723
Moco-chan, you can't just feel it!

00:20:56.863 --> 00:20:57.103
Synchronize!

00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:03.566
Are you happy now?

00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:05.049
Are you happy now?

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:09.315
She finally felt it.

00:21:10.117 --> 00:21:12.741
I don't think that counts.

00:21:13.102 --> 00:21:13.622
Really?

00:21:13.662 --> 00:21:17.008
No, I don't think that counts.

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:18.290
I think it counts.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.632
Make me happy.

00:21:20.168 --> 00:21:21.770
We will agree to disagree.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.793
Not synchronizing on the agreement part.

00:21:25.813 --> 00:21:26.614
BAU BAU!

00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:30.318
BAU BAU!

00:21:30.438 --> 00:21:33.921
Trying too hard!

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:37.185
Ruffians!

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:41.949
It's not anymore, you know, unofficial FUWAMOCO World Tour news.

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:48.015
But... Had a dream.

00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:52.958
I had a dream about fans.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.205
It's kind of a weird dream, but I felt happy.

00:21:57.225 --> 00:21:57.466
What?

00:21:57.626 --> 00:21:59.349
I felt happy at the end of the dream.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.092
Then tell me your full dream!

00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:05.059
Why did you feel happy at the end of it?

00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:08.265
I don't know, it was just like a hum hum hum feeling.

00:22:10.068 --> 00:22:13.353
Yeah, I'm the Ruffians.

00:22:13.493 --> 00:22:15.536
For some reason I was like in a hotel.

00:22:15.576 --> 00:22:17.639
And everyone else was there too.

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:20.643
Everybody from hololive, yeah.

00:22:20.763 --> 00:22:26.972
But it was late at night and for some reason I decided to go down to the ground floor to get some mail.

00:22:26.992 --> 00:22:28.675
I was like, oh I have to go get the mail.

00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:32.380
But you know it's late at night so you're kind of in your pajamas.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.324
Not so much in your pajamas.

00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:38.032
And I didn't really want to put on pajama pants.

00:22:39.134 --> 00:22:41.259
So I just had my pajama shirt.

00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:42.782
Pajama shirt?

00:22:42.802 --> 00:22:42.902
Yeah.

00:22:43.784 --> 00:22:47.311
And you know, so I was like, okay, I'm going to go get the mail.

00:22:47.331 --> 00:22:47.652
What?!

00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:47.652
!

00:22:48.627 --> 00:22:49.889
I'm just going down.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.752
Just to put down my shirt.

00:22:52.633 --> 00:22:54.015
See ya.

00:22:54.075 --> 00:23:00.865
So I went to go get the meal and I got the meal and I was waiting to go back up in the elevator from the very bottom floor.

00:23:01.606 --> 00:23:05.752
And you know, I was waiting the elevator gets there.

00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:08.276
And I was surprised because the door is open.

00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:12.863
And Elizabeth is just standing there naked.

00:23:12.843 --> 00:23:19.030
And she was a little surprised because Fuwawa was here!

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.655
And so she just pressed the close button!

00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:24.777
The close button!

00:23:24.797 --> 00:23:25.979
Not the close button!

00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:26.339
The close button!

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:27.401
The door is closed!

00:23:27.921 --> 00:23:30.144
And I guess she went back up and I was like, okay.

00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:31.666
That's kind of weird.

00:23:32.427 --> 00:23:33.648
But I guess, you know.

00:23:34.089 --> 00:23:36.652
I guess!

00:23:36.672 --> 00:23:36.952
I guess!

00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:38.774
So I don't know, you know.

00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:41.938
So I just decided to wait for another elevator.

00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:44.782
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:48.307 --> 00:23:50.170
Have a howl of a day!

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:58.783
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:02.188
Have a howl of a day!

00:24:02.168 --> 00:24:05.614
I don't know, I just remember I was a little awkward, you know.

00:24:05.674 --> 00:24:07.718
What do you say in a situation like that?

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:10.042
I don't know, but I was like, you know, it's okay.

00:24:10.643 --> 00:24:12.667
I don't have pants on either.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.658
It's good to have lots of hobbies, that kind of conversation.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.791
And then I woke up.

00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:29.446
I don't know, I guess you just like being one with the nature and the elevator and the hotel lobby late at night.

00:24:29.787 --> 00:24:30.287
Did you stare?

00:24:30.327 --> 00:24:31.469
Would you stare?

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:32.932
I did not stare.

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:34.274
I did not stare.

00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:37.318
I did not see anything except Elizabeth's flesh.

00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:43.688
That was a happy dream?

00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:45.291
I don't know how that was a happy dream.

00:24:45.311 --> 00:24:46.873
I woke up feeling like...

00:24:46.853 --> 00:24:52.945
Was it racist happiness because you were able to see Elizabeth in her dream?

00:24:52.985 --> 00:24:53.488
Maybe.

00:24:53.654 --> 00:24:54.315
I don't know.

00:24:56.018 --> 00:25:01.047
I imagine, like, in Evangelion, you know where everyone's in the elevator all together.

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:06.676
No, it's the shoulder-to-shoulder.

00:25:06.696 --> 00:25:08.880
It wasn't that big of an elevator, Moco-chan.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.004
Why would you stand shoulder-to-shoulder?

00:25:11.044 --> 00:25:13.288
Because we're having a conversation!

00:25:13.668 --> 00:25:15.532
I'm just not looking her in the eye.

00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:16.894
We don't even stand shoulder-to-shoulder!

00:25:16.874 --> 00:25:21.119
I know, but... I'm not looking her in the eye, I'm just looking forward.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.402
That's the safe place to look, you know?

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:26.226
At the door, at the elevator, as it goes upwards.

00:25:27.087 --> 00:25:27.748
That's the place.

00:25:28.328 --> 00:25:29.130
Apparently.

00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:32.754
Yeah.

00:25:32.774 --> 00:25:33.555
That was my dream.

00:25:33.595 --> 00:25:38.241
I have dreams like that, Ruffians!

00:25:39.588 --> 00:25:40.791
Hi!

00:25:40.811 --> 00:25:43.317
Did you ask about... No, I think she didn't have them.

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:45.423
Because... She just didn't.

00:25:45.723 --> 00:25:46.305
She just didn't.

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:47.388
Yeah.

00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:48.952
Yeah.

00:25:49.272 --> 00:25:51.117
You know, just like how I was like...

00:25:51.755 --> 00:25:52.376
No pants.

00:25:56.041 --> 00:25:56.661
Just exception.

00:25:57.142 --> 00:25:58.564
Yeah, I'm just accepting it, you know.

00:25:58.584 --> 00:26:01.247
You know, it's a late night.

00:26:01.668 --> 00:26:03.090
Nobody's gonna be down there.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.491
Understandable.

00:26:07.115 --> 00:26:09.898
Whatever Mococo, I don't know Moco-chan was.

00:26:09.978 --> 00:26:11.260
No, I was probably asleep.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.201
Probably.

00:26:13.623 --> 00:26:16.727
No hostiles!

00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:17.408
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:19.430
Yeah, just normal.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.391
I woke up feeling happy.

00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:22.332
That was a dream?

00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:24.554
It was a dream, Fufu.

00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:26.236
It did not happen in real life.

00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:27.357
No.

00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:30.179
BAU BAU.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.502
Was it a dream?

00:26:33.522 --> 00:26:33.622
Yeah!

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:34.123
It did happen.

00:26:34.783 --> 00:26:35.624
It is.

00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:37.326
We went and had some fun.

00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:40.689
Because we were on a Joypolis trip.

00:26:40.949 --> 00:26:45.213
Together with Biboo and Kawii-san!

00:26:45.233 --> 00:26:45.353
Oh my!

00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:51.444
We had a bunch of fun together at the Frustrating Bargains, and I was like, what is Joypolis?

00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:51.984
Joypolis?

00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:56.472
We talked about it before, but it's like an arcade amusement park.

00:26:56.492 --> 00:26:57.915
I was sick of one!

00:26:57.935 --> 00:26:58.776
Yes!

00:26:58.796 --> 00:26:59.618
And it's really fun.

00:26:59.678 --> 00:27:00.299
It's amazing.

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:03.264
It's like, you know, like an arcade and a music park came together.

00:27:03.364 --> 00:27:03.544
Yes!

00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:03.985
Yes!

00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:10.076
That's what it's like, there's like roller coasters and other fun games and like rhythm games and stuff.

00:27:10.717 --> 00:27:10.817
Yeah!

00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:13.080
Yeah, yeah, and Zoidpolis.

00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:14.742
It's so much fun.

00:27:15.683 --> 00:27:20.890
So, you know, was Biboo tall enough to ride any rides?

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.711
That was the first thing we did!

00:27:21.731 --> 00:27:25.276
There was, you know, like a little Sonic outside being like, how tall are you?

00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:26.357
Sonic's this tall.

00:27:26.638 --> 00:27:29.081
And we're like, oh, Biboo, go measure your height with Sonic.

00:27:29.542 --> 00:27:32.065
And then Biboo was just, just tall enough.

00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:34.088
Just a bit taller.

00:27:34.108 --> 00:27:37.412
And we're like, oh good, you're not the same height as Sonic.

00:27:37.392 --> 00:27:39.896
But then I realized, oh, that's for the kids.

00:27:40.657 --> 00:27:44.783
Then there's a bunch of kids, I was like, oh, people, you have to get away.

00:27:44.803 --> 00:27:47.366
Kids, they're in the way.

00:27:47.386 --> 00:27:54.517
We actually did search up how tall Sonic is, but he's shorter, apparently.

00:27:54.537 --> 00:27:58.202
Shorter than the sign was.

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.584
But yeah, we had a bunch of fun!

00:28:01.604 --> 00:28:07.160
There was a special event going on for a singer-actor named Matsuken!

00:28:07.742 --> 00:28:10.089
He sings the song Matsuken Samba.

00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:14.301
So Matsuken Samba was played everywhere you went!

00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:16.443
Matsuken is a oompa.

00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:17.764
Habiba.

00:28:17.784 --> 00:28:17.965
Calliope.

00:28:18.045 --> 00:28:21.448
I didn't know who he was but now I think I know who he is.

00:28:21.488 --> 00:28:23.530
We watched Matsuken's show.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.793
His show on the stage which was just the MV playing.

00:28:26.813 --> 00:28:29.616
Which I've seen already many times.

00:28:29.636 --> 00:28:35.502
And then there were so many cute girls and you know there was Matsuken, Oshii and they had all this stuff.

00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:38.665
And they had Uchiwa.

00:28:39.566 --> 00:28:39.746
Matsuken!

00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:40.086
Yeah!

00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:44.592
We danced!

00:28:44.612 --> 00:28:46.395
Karin-senpai didn't know the dance, but she did by hand.

00:28:46.415 --> 00:28:49.379
Karin-senpai was dancing the most, you know.

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:54.026
And we went on the rollercoaster, which was like a rhythm game and also played Matsuken Samba.

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.027
And I was so scared.

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:57.490
I've never been so scared of Matsuken Samba ever.

00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:58.672
It was very frightening.

00:28:58.692 --> 00:29:02.197
I was like screaming and then I opened my eyes and he's just not in his costume.

00:29:02.217 --> 00:29:06.443
He's just recording in the recording booth.

00:29:06.463 --> 00:29:07.845
I was like, what the heck is going on?

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:14.624
It was a lot of fun and we got to play House of the Dead together!

00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:16.991
Ruffians, I have to brag.

00:29:18.114 --> 00:29:19.639
This is worth it!

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.206
I got number one.

00:29:22.473 --> 00:29:24.556
Of the day!

00:29:25.237 --> 00:29:26.499
And how's the day?

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.161
Number one of the day, okay?

00:29:28.181 --> 00:29:29.663
It's not of a group.

00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:32.407
Between Calli-senpai and Biboo.

00:29:32.808 --> 00:29:35.392
Number one of the whole entire day!

00:29:35.993 --> 00:29:37.395
I did not cheat.

00:29:37.415 --> 00:29:46.708
You know, I just killed everything in my path with my steady aim and a very good strong fear of zombies.

00:29:47.363 --> 00:29:48.771
Did you take a photo?

00:29:49.274 --> 00:29:51.649
I would have taken a photo but they said no photos.

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:52.615
No photos.

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:53.279
Yeah.

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:54.707
So, I would have.

00:29:56.797 --> 00:30:04.509
Yeah, and we got to the Fortune Forest, which we talked about before with Shiori and Nerissa before.

00:30:04.749 --> 00:30:07.794
Nerissa got really really into the Fortune Forest.

00:30:08.194 --> 00:30:10.218
I'll explain a little bit about Fortune Forest.

00:30:10.258 --> 00:30:15.165
It's a forest that you go in and then you know you put in your name and all that stuff.

00:30:15.185 --> 00:30:17.429
And then it asks you, what are you interested in?

00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:24.880
Fortune, you know, is a little more about yourself, about your career, about romance, a bunch of different stuff.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.227
It's very detailed, very personal, very correct.

00:30:29.248 --> 00:30:31.011
And it's also in English, too!

00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.713
Also, uh, interesting fortunes.

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:34.617
Yeah!

00:30:34.637 --> 00:30:37.722
And, you know, there's a room inside of it.

00:30:37.742 --> 00:30:40.006
A room called Fenyar's Gate.

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:40.767
Fenyar's Gate?

00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:41.168
Gate.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.791
Yeah.

00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:46.497
And it will only open if you hold hands.

00:30:46.848 --> 00:30:48.090
With your, what's it?

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.771
True love?

00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:49.472
With your true love?

00:30:49.532 --> 00:30:49.932
I don't know.

00:30:50.293 --> 00:30:51.755
Or you could be the chosen one.

00:30:52.135 --> 00:30:54.719
The chosen ones with the person you have a bond with.

00:30:54.739 --> 00:30:56.882
You can see inside, but you cannot get in.

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:58.805
And it looks really cool in there.

00:31:00.046 --> 00:31:03.291
And Nerissa was like, I can't go home until I go in there.

00:31:03.812 --> 00:31:05.214
We found a way to get in there.

00:31:05.274 --> 00:31:05.574
Yes.

00:31:05.915 --> 00:31:06.195
Yes.

00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:08.739
And Biboo and Calli's up by us.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.902
They are also crazy too.

00:31:11.062 --> 00:31:12.244
They are also gamers.

00:31:14.927 --> 00:31:16.129
We have to get into the room!

00:31:16.109 --> 00:31:17.651
So, did you guys hold hands?

00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:18.372
Yes.

00:31:18.432 --> 00:31:20.615
We held hands how many times?

00:31:20.755 --> 00:31:22.678
Yes, I held hands with Calli-senpai.

00:31:22.698 --> 00:31:24.480
Moco-chan, you held hands with Biboo.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.463
Then we held hands together.

00:31:27.023 --> 00:31:27.124
Yeah.

00:31:27.144 --> 00:31:28.766
Yeah, we had to do it a bunch of times.

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:29.407
Three times?

00:31:29.427 --> 00:31:29.867
Four times?

00:31:29.987 --> 00:31:32.310
Four times, we had to do it a bunch of times.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.436
Yeah, but it felt good once we got in because, you know, the door opens.

00:31:37.317 --> 00:31:39.280
How did they do it?

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.860
Oh my gosh!

00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:40.501
They got in there!

00:31:40.521 --> 00:31:41.382
How did they get in there?

00:31:41.402 --> 00:31:45.267
Yeah, I would've got to do it twice.

00:31:45.628 --> 00:31:45.728
Yeah.

00:31:46.332 --> 00:31:51.339
We're not toys in a magical place.

00:31:52.561 --> 00:31:58.770
But then you get your fortune printed on the wonderful Munchkin paper at the end too!

00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:04.920
You know and then you can share your fortunes all together and talk about how accurate they are and how playful they are.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.602
Laugh a lot.

00:32:06.582 --> 00:32:22.431
Titan Attraction.

00:32:22.951 --> 00:32:25.274
And I was very frightened.

00:32:25.334 --> 00:32:27.657
I was holding onto Biboo like she was my child.

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:31.242
I was so scared.

00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.625
It just reminded me of the haunted house with Calli-senpai.

00:32:33.645 --> 00:32:37.330
They said not to push, but I remember pushing Calli-senpai so much.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.352
I was like, I'm gonna push her again.

00:32:39.392 --> 00:32:40.854
Yeah.

00:32:40.874 --> 00:32:42.697
There was a bunch of other people.

00:32:42.737 --> 00:32:46.962
And I think they were sort of shocked at how much we were screaming.

00:32:47.643 --> 00:32:47.743
Yeah.

00:32:50.474 --> 00:32:51.899
We're just into the rule, right?

00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:52.682
Moco-chan!

00:32:52.702 --> 00:32:54.408
We're really into it!

00:32:54.428 --> 00:32:55.312
We're gonna get eaten by titans!

00:32:55.874 --> 00:32:56.034
Yeah.

00:32:56.556 --> 00:32:57.660
We survived.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.222
Just so you know.

00:32:58.242 --> 00:32:59.005
Just barely though.

00:32:59.105 --> 00:32:59.828
Yeah.

00:32:59.848 --> 00:33:00.952
Not all of us did though.

00:33:01.053 --> 00:33:01.193
No.

00:33:01.578 --> 00:33:07.426
But we also, we were on a transformers ride, and it was Biboo.

00:33:07.446 --> 00:33:08.848
And I was carrying Senpai.

00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:13.134
Yeah, and it goes upside down, and we have to spin upside down, and you hang upside down.

00:33:13.594 --> 00:33:20.003
Yeah, Biboo and I were screaming so loud, I'm sure that everybody could hear us.

00:33:20.023 --> 00:33:23.227
Yeah, we were carrying Senpai and I. We were screaming so, so loud.

00:33:23.247 --> 00:33:25.651
Biboo and I, our hair was going everywhere.

00:33:26.332 --> 00:33:27.433
Everywhere.

00:33:27.413 --> 00:33:40.892
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:40.932 --> 00:33:44.798
Have a howl of a day!

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:48.490
And then we had snacks all together!

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.292
We drank a bajillion drinks!

00:33:50.312 --> 00:33:53.917
We had the Matsuken Fruits OLE!

00:33:54.538 --> 00:33:55.580
OLE!

00:33:56.141 --> 00:33:58.324
OLE!

00:33:58.404 --> 00:34:00.226
Matsuken Fruits OLE!

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:07.917
We had a bunch of drinks and Biboo had some food too!

00:34:07.897 --> 00:34:10.760
Ketchup all over her face, sauce everywhere!

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.323
On one cheek, on the other cheek, on her nose!

00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:23.833
I would get the tissue, and then get it off of her cheek, and then she would take the tissue, and then she would push it on her nose, and then she had it on her nose!

00:34:24.594 --> 00:34:35.044
I had to go take another tissue afterwards, and then go and wipe her face for her, because it was still everywhere!

00:34:35.084 --> 00:34:36.165
Yeah...

00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:41.329
Biboo.

00:34:42.203 --> 00:34:44.806
There's something I'm a little sad about.

00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:47.069
FUWAMOCO we were very good demodogs.

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:48.711
We were late.

00:34:49.271 --> 00:34:49.932
We were good ones?

00:34:49.952 --> 00:34:51.554
We weren't very good, Moco-chan.

00:34:51.574 --> 00:34:52.415
We were late.

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:55.699
So it may be more Calli-senpai wait for us.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.525
And while they're waiting, Calli-senpai, she went to go get some ice cream.

00:35:00.585 --> 00:35:01.126
Ice cream!

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:06.112
And I don't know if you've had a Turkish ice cream before, Ruffians!

00:35:06.132 --> 00:35:07.133
You might have seen it on YouTube!

00:35:07.153 --> 00:35:08.835
Turkish ice cream!

00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:11.967
Apparently she had some turkish ice cream.

00:35:12.948 --> 00:35:16.752
But she didn't know the kind of game that is played with it.

00:35:16.772 --> 00:35:18.674
So I told her to put ice in.

00:35:18.714 --> 00:35:19.595
She didn't know.

00:35:21.617 --> 00:35:27.604
Yeah.

00:35:27.624 --> 00:35:33.170
So just as the match began, Kalli's and my uncle and Digby started getting ice cream hot!

00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:36.493
Yeah, Digby gave us the ice cream, taking it away from Kalli-senpai for her to be like, it's too sweet!

00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:45.001
We should've been on time!

00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:46.165
We should've been on time!

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:47.631
I wanted to see that!

00:35:47.898 --> 00:35:51.483
FUWAMOCO, it was a lot of fun!

00:35:52.184 --> 00:35:55.209
But you know, there's actually some cool news!

00:35:55.229 --> 00:35:57.472
In just one day from today!

00:35:58.113 --> 00:36:04.702
Joyfulis is gonna be starting their whole live campaign!

00:36:04.722 --> 00:36:07.446
Together with Nippon Apple!

00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:10.411
Once again, once again.

00:36:10.972 --> 00:36:12.534
Mocoto, you wanna share a picture?

00:36:14.977 --> 00:36:15.458
Once again.

00:36:19.825 --> 00:36:21.587
Yeah!

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.754
It's super duper cute!

00:36:27.774 --> 00:36:30.697
They're gonna be having performances!

00:36:30.717 --> 00:36:30.797
Yes!

00:36:30.817 --> 00:36:32.999
And also a collab with the Halfpipe Tokyo!

00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:34.281
Oh, the Halfpipe Tokyo!

00:36:34.301 --> 00:36:36.423
Yes, which is a music game.

00:36:36.443 --> 00:36:40.067
Which we weren't able to go on this time, but their songs are gonna be in it!

00:36:40.087 --> 00:36:42.169
Yeah, you know, a bunch of different things.

00:36:42.189 --> 00:36:44.792
Merchandise, a lot of food!

00:36:44.812 --> 00:36:48.136
So if you're curious about Joyfuls, now is the time to go!

00:36:48.156 --> 00:36:49.377
I think it's gonna be open for

00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:50.558
Quite a while.

00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:51.279
A few months.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.160
A month more.

00:36:52.581 --> 00:36:53.162
Please check it out.

00:36:53.182 --> 00:36:54.003
Not a scary one.

00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:54.503
No.

00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:56.206
It's like a rhythm game.

00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:57.287
Yes.

00:36:57.307 --> 00:36:58.348
And it's very fun.

00:36:58.368 --> 00:37:00.531
I went on with Nerissa last time.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:01.052
Yeah, I went with Shiori.

00:37:01.072 --> 00:37:05.317
And we did really poorly because of me.

00:37:05.337 --> 00:37:05.697
It's really scary.

00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:08.461
It goes fast and it spins and goes upside.

00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:09.963
Not upside down but almost upside down.

00:37:09.983 --> 00:37:10.503
Almost upside down.

00:37:10.784 --> 00:37:11.164
Yeah.

00:37:11.485 --> 00:37:15.209
And then you have to get the rhythm and stuff at the right time to be able to get a good score.

00:37:15.229 --> 00:37:16.170
And I just didn't.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.731
I gave up.

00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:23.139
Yeah, Shiori and I started spinning too hard and we were like, wow, let's slow down a bit on this.

00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:30.569
Yeah, but if you're curious and you're in Tokyo, please check it out.

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:33.573
This is so much fun, so I really recommend it.

00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:35.555
There's also Nepo Labo themed Dippin' Dots.

00:37:36.136 --> 00:37:40.001
Yeah, Nepo Labo Dippin' Dots.

00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:41.362
Lots of fun!

00:37:41.383 --> 00:37:44.446
Ice cream.

00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:45.688
BAU BAU!

00:37:45.668 --> 00:37:46.810
Wow.

00:37:48.654 --> 00:37:53.985
Should we take a look at our Doggie of the Day?

00:37:54.546 --> 00:37:58.134
Okay.

00:37:58.154 --> 00:37:58.254
Okay.

00:37:58.555 --> 00:37:59.176
Okay.

00:38:00.218 --> 00:38:00.839
It's a pose.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.142
It's a pose.

00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:19.423
Moco-chan, maybe you have some encouraging words to share with us.

00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:23.012
Maybe just a little bit.

00:38:24.195 --> 00:38:24.957
Okay.

00:38:36.428 --> 00:38:37.650
Ruffians!

00:38:38.772 --> 00:38:40.215
It's that time again!

00:38:41.137 --> 00:38:44.463
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:38:45.265 --> 00:38:47.129
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.631
Mococo!

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:50.996
Ruffians!

00:38:51.016 --> 00:38:57.829
I know, sometimes I can feel like everyday is an uphill battle.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.912
Every day, you feel like you're climbing an unending mountain.

00:39:04.895 --> 00:39:10.612
But slowly and surely, with time and effort, you can overcome it, okay?

00:39:12.377 --> 00:39:13.962
Remember what I said.

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:18.456
One step a day is seven steps legal.

00:39:18.476 --> 00:39:19.256
Right, Ruffians?

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.358
All your efforts add up.

00:39:21.999 --> 00:39:24.842
Even if you don't see them right away.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:27.184
You will get results.

00:39:27.204 --> 00:39:27.985
Something will change.

00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:32.169
So let's keep doing our best towards what matters to us.

00:39:32.189 --> 00:39:34.111
Towards our dreams together, okay?

00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:38.075
I know you can do it!

00:39:38.915 --> 00:39:42.178
You're amazing!

00:39:42.198 --> 00:39:42.619
Ganbatte desu!

00:39:42.639 --> 00:39:43.780
BAU BAU!

00:39:44.806 --> 00:39:48.356
BAU BAU!

00:39:48.376 --> 00:39:52.187
One step a day, seven steps a week.

00:39:53.511 --> 00:39:56.138
Let's keep on remembering that, okay?

00:39:56.158 --> 00:39:59.187
Ruffians remember how hard it gets, okay?

00:39:59.977 --> 00:40:02.159
BAU BAU!

00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:06.163
Well, let's take a look at who our Doggie of the Day is today!

00:40:07.684 --> 00:40:15.931
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:18.994
It's Sable!

00:40:19.014 --> 00:40:19.174
BAU BAU!

00:40:19.194 --> 00:40:19.514
It's Sable!

00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:22.417
That's the dog you meet for the beach, huh?

00:40:22.437 --> 00:40:26.120
Yeah, I bet you she loves to swim, huh?

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.123
She's apparently very silly too.

00:40:30.149 --> 00:40:31.752
Look at those ears!

00:40:31.772 --> 00:40:33.474
Why is the ears so silly?

00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:34.696
Floppy ears.

00:40:35.838 --> 00:40:37.501
What a beautiful sunrise.

00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:39.263
Sunrise too.

00:40:39.544 --> 00:40:40.345
Sunset, sunrise.

00:40:40.766 --> 00:40:41.767
What's he scared of?

00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:43.730
I don't think Sable's scared of anything.

00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:44.111
No.

00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:45.193
Yeah, I know.

00:40:45.213 --> 00:40:46.495
Maybe dolphins.

00:40:46.515 --> 00:40:48.478
Dolphins are kind of silly.

00:40:48.678 --> 00:40:49.900
I could understand that, yeah.

00:40:51.423 --> 00:40:53.526
How does Sable bump bump Moco-chan?

00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:56.190
I think it's like...

00:40:57.571 --> 00:41:06.282
FUWAMOCO.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:14.911
Moco-chan, you're looking up at the surface of the water while you do that?

00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.112
Yes!

00:41:16.132 --> 00:41:16.212
Yes!

00:41:16.232 --> 00:41:18.155
She's touching the water!

00:41:19.016 --> 00:41:19.958
Yes!

00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:20.158
Yes!

00:41:20.178 --> 00:41:20.478

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.100
Yes

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.645
You know, being friendly and baw bawing at others too!

00:41:39.665 --> 00:41:40.906
And dolphins.

00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:41.768
And dolphins.

00:41:42.328 --> 00:41:42.949
Yeah?

00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:43.830
Yeah.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.192
Get out of her way.

00:41:45.552 --> 00:41:49.358
It sounds like every day would be a fun one together with Sable there.

00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:55.726
Make sure to give her lots of head pats and towel pats after the beats too.

00:41:56.106 --> 00:41:57.328
Especially with all the sound.

00:41:57.933 --> 00:42:13.815
FUWAMOCO!

00:42:14.167 --> 00:42:15.809
Tense weather.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.372
Not so great, huh?

00:42:17.913 --> 00:42:24.943
It looks like it was a little bit of a moody weather adventure.

00:42:24.963 --> 00:42:25.143
Yeah!

00:42:25.163 --> 00:42:25.424
Thunderstorm!

00:42:25.444 --> 00:42:25.764
Ka-shun!

00:42:25.784 --> 00:42:26.145
Yeah!

00:42:26.686 --> 00:42:32.995
You know, going out into the weather when it's raining lots or a little bit gusty can be a lot of fun, right?

00:42:33.015 --> 00:42:33.215
Sometimes.

00:42:33.235 --> 00:42:34.717
Do you like your Ruffians?

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:35.979
Huh?

00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:36.099
Yeah!

00:42:38.102 --> 00:42:38.984
Thunderstorms are cool.

00:42:39.024 --> 00:42:39.865
They are cool.

00:42:40.746 --> 00:42:41.047
Yeah?

00:42:41.087 --> 00:42:41.187
Yeah.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.035
I don't know out on the water though, huh?

00:42:45.055 --> 00:42:47.259
Well, the thunderstorm, it's just being loud, right?

00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:48.100
Not lightning.

00:42:49.022 --> 00:42:51.426
Lightning, maybe, that's not the smart idea.

00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:51.646
True.

00:42:52.368 --> 00:42:53.890
Right.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:54.011
Yeah.

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.375
And you like the rain when you're inside?

00:42:56.395 --> 00:42:57.617
I like that too.

00:42:57.637 --> 00:42:58.338
I like thunderstorms.

00:42:58.358 --> 00:43:00.121
But you can't hear it on the windows.

00:43:00.562 --> 00:43:03.447
Rei-senpai does not like thunderstorms.

00:43:03.467 --> 00:43:03.527
No.

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:03.647
Yeah.

00:43:04.167 --> 00:43:08.175
But you know, we hope you got a bunch of great photos of the water there.

00:43:08.616 --> 00:43:11.341
And that you made sure to dry off too afterwards.

00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:11.742
Yeah.

00:43:11.762 --> 00:43:13.586
No catching a cold, got it?

00:43:13.606 --> 00:43:13.886
Yeah.

00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:15.369
That's a must.

00:43:15.389 --> 00:43:15.630
BAU BAU!

00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:18.696
BAU BAU!

00:43:19.177 --> 00:43:21.621
If you catch a cold then you can't go on as many walks, right?

00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:21.942
No.

00:43:22.403 --> 00:43:22.463
No.

00:43:22.882 --> 00:43:29.991
And for the Question of the Day!

00:43:30.011 --> 00:43:34.476
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:43:34.496 --> 00:43:34.637
Fuwawa!

00:43:35.037 --> 00:43:39.383
What's something you wish more people would notice about Mococo?

00:43:39.403 --> 00:43:46.131
Mococo, what's something you wish more people would notice about Fuwawa?

00:43:47.092 --> 00:43:47.833
This is tricky.

00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:50.256
I feel like this is a really hard one.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.212
Good question.

00:43:52.232 --> 00:43:54.754
Good question.

00:43:54.774 --> 00:43:57.758
It's tricky because, you know, we're twins.

00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:09.070
I mean... You know... I mean, hopefully you've realized, but, you know, Fuwawa is really sweet and loving.

00:44:09.611 --> 00:44:10.652
She likes to be silly.

00:44:11.433 --> 00:44:13.215
You know, sometimes.

00:44:13.355 --> 00:44:14.937
Just like me, you know.

00:44:16.058 --> 00:44:16.919
Just sometimes.

00:44:16.939 --> 00:44:19.382
And we tease each other equally.

00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:20.243
Yeah.

00:44:20.543 --> 00:44:29.755
So, you know, when sometimes I see stuff like Ruffians or people calling her evil, it makes me sad.

00:44:32.578 --> 00:44:35.422
At least I wouldn't see that so much.

00:44:35.442 --> 00:44:44.273
But I think a lot of people out there just don't recognize her personality or get to know her well enough, and so they make assumptions to fill in the gaps.

00:44:45.653 --> 00:44:50.261
She's really sweet too, just like me of course.

00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:51.462
Moco-chan you're pretty sweet.

00:44:52.164 --> 00:44:52.845
We are twins.

00:44:54.127 --> 00:45:07.889
And you know... Guys, even though she doesn't hold the controller too much... It doesn't mean that she's bad at games.

00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:10.193
I'm not bad at games.

00:45:10.213 --> 00:45:10.413
No.

00:45:11.054 --> 00:45:12.657
No.

00:45:13.413 --> 00:45:15.275
I help you so much, right Moco-chan?

00:45:15.315 --> 00:45:15.936
Yeah!

00:45:15.956 --> 00:45:16.277
Always!

00:45:16.357 --> 00:45:17.358
Never gets stuck.

00:45:18.339 --> 00:45:18.440
Yeah.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.281
We're a team!

00:45:20.022 --> 00:45:20.722
We're a team!

00:45:20.743 --> 00:45:24.988
It doesn't mean that she's not a pro gamer.

00:45:25.008 --> 00:45:26.430
That's all.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.692
Almost more pro than you?

00:45:28.773 --> 00:45:29.514
No.

00:45:29.714 --> 00:45:35.141
I got today's top in-house event!

00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:35.482
Android boys!

00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:36.022
Today's?

00:45:36.243 --> 00:45:36.964
Yeah!

00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:39.967
Well, the other day, that day.

00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:40.568
Yeah!

00:45:40.588 --> 00:45:42.711
BAU BAU!

00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:46.345
Thanks Moco-chan!

00:45:48.227 --> 00:45:51.131
More people notice about Moco-chan.

00:45:52.152 --> 00:45:53.814
Moco-chan is really sweet.

00:45:56.578 --> 00:45:59.581
Her tummy gets upset when she's nervous.

00:46:00.342 --> 00:46:04.167
Most of the time she's nervous because she wants you to notice something.

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:06.890
That's important, right?

00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:08.152
Yeah.

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:12.597
Moco-chan would like you to read our brains more.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.141
Right.

00:46:17.185 --> 00:46:18.767
Yeah.

00:46:18.787 --> 00:46:21.450
That's a bit of a hard one, huh?

00:46:26.556 --> 00:46:26.716
Yeah.

00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:27.376
Yeah.

00:46:27.396 --> 00:46:33.303
But FUWAMO, we can't share with you with our brains and head parts before I ask for them.

00:46:34.284 --> 00:46:39.310
But we'll try and share that with our songs, right?

00:46:41.652 --> 00:46:59.442
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:46:59.422 --> 00:47:00.383
Happy.

00:47:00.403 --> 00:47:01.084
Pero Sighting.

00:47:01.124 --> 00:47:02.185
I like Pero Sighting.

00:47:02.265 --> 00:47:05.288
It's just a nice, yummy, delicious pero cake.

00:47:05.308 --> 00:47:05.769
Cake Sighting.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.472
And some very wonderful questions.

00:47:09.213 --> 00:47:10.714
As well as logs too.

00:47:10.974 --> 00:47:13.737
We're always looking for many more too, Ruffians.

00:47:13.757 --> 00:47:15.319
So please share them with us.

00:47:15.519 --> 00:47:16.420
The hashtag.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.203
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:47:21.766 --> 00:47:22.086

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:24.489
Let's take a look at our next stream coming up here.

00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:26.391
The thumbnail is still...

00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:27.252
Being designed.

00:47:27.753 --> 00:47:28.313
But!

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:30.176
Let's take a look at the schedule.

00:47:30.636 --> 00:47:36.344
Next at 6pm PT today, we're gonna be having an Advent collab!

00:47:36.364 --> 00:47:40.949
This time we're playing Old Market Simulator for the first time!

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.573
Moco-chan, this is a game you really wanted to play all together.

00:47:43.593 --> 00:47:45.836
We're gonna have a market together.

00:47:46.136 --> 00:47:48.319
Like an RPG kind of like market?

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:49.921
I want it to be an old market.

00:47:49.941 --> 00:47:50.522
And business.

00:47:50.782 --> 00:47:52.144
Business together with Advent.

00:47:52.164 --> 00:47:53.065
Are we rivals?

00:47:53.205 --> 00:47:53.425
No.

00:47:54.166 --> 00:47:55.208
Team.

00:47:55.508 --> 00:47:55.568
Oh.

00:47:55.548 --> 00:48:02.058
Is Biboo gonna raise the chickens?

00:48:02.198 --> 00:48:04.181
And then Shiori the cows?

00:48:05.824 --> 00:48:08.307
We'll figure it out!

00:48:08.327 --> 00:48:09.729
Please join us, Ruffians!

00:48:10.491 --> 00:48:12.013
BAU BAU!

00:48:12.734 --> 00:48:23.310
If we take a look at our schedule here more, you might notice, Ruffians, that there's no Friday FUWAMOCO on the schedule.

00:48:25.872 --> 00:48:28.956
But that isn't a mistake.

00:48:29.676 --> 00:48:31.519
It's just temporary for now.

00:48:31.539 --> 00:48:37.245
But we're going to be doing only one FUWAMOCO Morning a week on Mondays for a little bit here.

00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:38.607
Even though today is Wednesday.

00:48:38.627 --> 00:48:40.489
Yeah, even though today is a Wednesday.

00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:44.914
You know, there are some things that we really want to do and need to get done.

00:48:45.795 --> 00:48:47.577
We think you know.

00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:54.248
We're pretty busy puppies, and we get kinda tired by the end of a busy day.

00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:58.516
So we think that it's best if we try this out for a little bit.

00:48:59.037 --> 00:49:01.161
And you know, you see how we feel from there.

00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:07.193
Thank you for understanding, Ruffians.

00:49:07.834 --> 00:49:08.054
No problem.

00:49:08.074 --> 00:49:11.100
I didn't say that.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.386
Let's take care of our feelings!

00:49:16.047 --> 00:49:17.369
BAU BAU!

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:23.798
And if we take another look at the schedule, you can see we have some more Metal Gear Solid 3 fun!

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:26.081
Maybe this time we're gonna finish the game.

00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:27.363
Maybe the end!

00:49:27.383 --> 00:49:32.631
As well as we're playing a brand new game called Cornered Dimension Girl that looks very very cute!

00:49:33.432 --> 00:49:39.180
We'll have to check that one out altogether because I don't know much about it except for that it looks cute and Moco-chan wanted to play it.
