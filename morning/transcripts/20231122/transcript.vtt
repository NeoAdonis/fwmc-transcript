05:22.597 --> 05:24.618
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:24.638 --> 05:28.781
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:28.901 --> 05:32.503
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:32.543 --> 05:34.705
BAU BAU!

05:35.505 --> 05:38.307
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:38.908 --> 05:40.729
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:41.850 --> 05:43.752
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:43.832 --> 05:46.295
BAU BAU BAU!

05:46.815 --> 05:50.920
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:50.940 --> 05:56.026
Ruffians, thank you for waking up and for joining us

05:56.526 --> 05:57.527
47 episodes!

05:57.867 --> 06:07.152
With every episode, I feel like I just start yelling it louder and higher pitch.

06:07.232 --> 06:11.334
Eventually, it's just gonna be... Eventually we'll thank you for joining us for...

06:14.016 --> 06:14.476
Like that.

06:16.237 --> 06:19.019
Well, we don't just make funny sounds, Ruffians.

06:19.139 --> 06:19.599
No!

06:19.660 --> 06:23.602
Especially Ruffians joining us for the first time today, we should probably explain ourselves.

06:23.622 --> 06:24.523
Probably explain.

06:24.683 --> 06:31.407
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:31.507 --> 06:31.927
A.k.a.

06:32.027 --> 06:32.908
FUWAMOCO-e!

06:33.088 --> 06:36.010
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO-e!

06:36.810 --> 06:42.133
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:42.313 --> 06:45.194
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.615
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

06:48.215 --> 06:52.097
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:52.117 --> 06:55.058
BAU BAU!

06:55.078 --> 06:59.300
Did you get sleep?

07:00.061 --> 07:01.521
Well rested, ruffians?

07:02.162 --> 07:03.943
Ready to bark with a new day?

07:06.400 --> 07:15.344
Did we have maybe a Pero Sighting?

07:16.085 --> 07:19.887
Well, you know, Pero, there was a video.

07:20.787 --> 07:24.309
And, well, Ruffians, did you see Pero by any chance?

07:24.649 --> 07:25.109
Let's see.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.631
We have... De-den!

07:30.708 --> 07:31.508
It's Pero!

07:31.548 --> 07:33.370
You found him, Ruffian!

07:33.390 --> 07:35.812
Maybe he's in better spirits after his vacation.

07:36.032 --> 07:36.692
Maybe.

07:37.693 --> 07:42.357
It looks like this Ruffian found him checking out the Miss Universe pageant.

07:43.217 --> 07:44.418
Was he looking to enter it?

07:48.822 --> 07:49.582
I see.

07:49.602 --> 07:49.702
Pero.

07:52.324 --> 07:55.587
You're not just there to look at the cute girls, right, Pero?

07:56.247 --> 07:56.728
Right!

07:58.735 --> 08:01.296
Maybe that's what he liked doing his vacation.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.277
Cute girls.

08:03.737 --> 08:05.678
That's awful, Pero.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.118
Yeah, pretty nasty.

08:07.979 --> 08:10.540
That's not what these competitions are for, you know.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.801
Gosh.

08:13.941 --> 08:18.523
Well, at least Moco-chan, he did get dressed up a little, right?

08:18.843 --> 08:19.203
Yeah, I guess.

08:19.243 --> 08:20.623
A little tie there.

08:20.643 --> 08:22.124
It's good, yeah.

08:22.824 --> 08:25.005
Well, we're glad you found Pero.

08:26.218 --> 08:28.459
I guess, I guess.

08:29.399 --> 08:33.061
At least, are all the ruffians happy he's back?

08:33.921 --> 08:34.861
Ruffians.

08:38.603 --> 08:40.804
It's questionable.

08:42.144 --> 08:42.545
Yes.

08:42.985 --> 08:45.946
Well, at least you're happy he's back, I guess.

08:46.638 --> 08:48.719
As long as the ruffians are smiling, right?

08:48.739 --> 08:50.840
Yeah, I'm happy that the ruffians are happy.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.161
That makes me happy.

08:54.461 --> 08:57.642
But we still have more of a job to fulfill here, Moco-chan.

08:58.002 --> 08:59.943
FUWAMOCO Morning continues!

09:00.003 --> 09:01.244
BAU BAU!

09:01.284 --> 09:06.166
Thank you for keeping your eyes open, ruffians.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.547
Even if maybe he's a big ruffian.

09:11.388 --> 09:11.768
But!

09:12.369 --> 09:14.570
Happy New Year!

09:14.650 --> 09:20.673
Yesterday, ruffians, it was Nerissa's birthday!

09:21.193 --> 09:21.614
Nerissa!

09:21.674 --> 09:23.755
BAU BAU!

09:24.055 --> 09:26.596
And it was, of course, her birthday.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.357
It's a day full of celebrations.

09:28.377 --> 09:29.498
That's what a birthday is!

09:29.758 --> 09:34.701
But not only just that, because it wasn't just her birthday.

09:35.649 --> 09:40.291
Also, because she hit 500,000 subscribers!

09:40.612 --> 09:43.713
Congratulations, Nerissa!

09:44.013 --> 09:47.095
We're so so happy for her and all the JL friends!

09:47.335 --> 09:48.896
BAU BAU!

09:49.676 --> 09:58.800
And you know, even on top of that, Nerissa released a new cover song of the opening theme of Elphelia and Lilium.

10:02.833 --> 10:03.974
Did you listen?

10:04.875 --> 10:06.557
It's something else!

10:06.677 --> 10:15.866
This time, Nerissa's older sister, Anerissa, helped her with the low harmonies on it too, so it's not just Nerissa singing, it's also her sister.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.509
For FUWAMOCO, it's kinda normal, but not for Nerissa.

10:19.549 --> 10:22.012
That's really cool, right?

10:22.352 --> 10:23.893
It's really, really cool.

10:25.815 --> 10:27.015
Have you listened to Ruffians?

10:28.356 --> 10:30.136
It's a really, really amazing cover.

10:30.156 --> 10:32.057
It's very suited for her.

10:32.077 --> 10:33.257
The demon of sound.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.458
Even though some people say it's more angelic sounding.

10:37.478 --> 10:38.599
I don't know.

10:38.819 --> 10:42.480
I feel like it's more demon.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.360
I feel like that.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.241
Like, I'm going to go

10:48.638 --> 10:50.704
It's gonna drive me crazy in a happy way.

10:51.266 --> 10:52.589
In a happy way, right?

10:52.670 --> 10:53.492
Like that, yeah.

10:53.532 --> 10:56.280
That's what the demon of sound does, maybe a bit.

10:58.948 --> 11:06.050
Actually, Ruffians, it was really just recently that we finally finished watching Alkaline.

11:06.170 --> 11:06.670
Right!

11:06.790 --> 11:10.991
We're glad that we watched it, but it was definitely something else.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.491
It was something else.

11:12.711 --> 11:14.352
Why did you think of the anime, Ruffians?

11:14.372 --> 11:15.252
Did you watch it?

11:15.952 --> 11:19.453
Maybe many years ago and FUWAMOCO just kind of late to the party.

11:19.593 --> 11:20.493
Is it a party?

11:20.593 --> 11:22.014
I don't know if it's a party.

11:22.574 --> 11:23.454
Late to something.

11:23.694 --> 11:25.734
A very interesting party.

11:25.915 --> 11:27.575
It was something alright.

11:28.876 --> 11:29.436
Intense.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.218
Oh, intensely different.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.701
It was an anime.

11:34.821 --> 11:36.382
It was an anime.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.463
That's good.

11:37.843 --> 11:39.284
That's a good statement.

11:39.304 --> 11:39.785
Yes.

11:41.987 --> 11:43.768
It was different.

11:43.988 --> 11:46.570
But fun fact about FUWAMOCO.

11:47.211 --> 11:51.274
Yeah, we've also sung in Latin quite a bit before too.

11:51.354 --> 11:52.315
Are you surprised?

11:53.496 --> 11:59.678
FUWAMOCO can sing a lot.

12:00.058 --> 12:05.599
It's really pretty, so you know it's nice to hear Nerissa sing a lot too.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.159
But, but, but, but, but, but!

12:07.599 --> 12:08.840
Also!

12:08.880 --> 12:14.161
Nerissa teased her upcoming first original song too!

12:14.481 --> 12:15.741
Are you surprised?

12:17.962 --> 12:19.702
We can't wait, ruffians!

12:20.723 --> 12:21.643
You know this, right?

12:25.205 --> 12:28.809
She also shared with us her birthday wish!

12:49.329 --> 12:59.697
It's released, but it includes a framed artboard, a t-shirt, a pin badge, and also a really cute ribbon-style keychain.

12:59.757 --> 13:01.779
It's all included in the merch set.

13:01.979 --> 13:05.261
It's Nerissa's very first birthday.

13:05.421 --> 13:06.322
It's not sold out.

13:06.442 --> 13:10.825
It's just the special limited edition version.

13:11.366 --> 13:12.427
You can still get it.

13:13.207 --> 13:14.868
The limited sold out, but...

13:16.363 --> 13:22.186
I know it's a bit frustrating, but it's also, you know, happy for Nerissa's birthday, right?

13:22.406 --> 13:24.107
But I really do love the keychain.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.609
It just looks so cute and fashionable.

13:26.629 --> 13:27.949
Just like Nerissa!

13:28.029 --> 13:34.473
You know, it's kind of like a little piece of Nerissa that you can carry around with you, right?

13:34.493 --> 13:36.374
It's pretty cute.

13:36.434 --> 13:38.415
Put it on your bag, on your keys.

13:38.475 --> 13:40.496
Where else could you put it?

13:40.856 --> 13:43.678
Ruffians, do you have any ideas or places to put Nerissa?

13:44.929 --> 13:47.492
Do you have a spot to put a keychain on your tummy?

13:47.512 --> 13:50.495
Ruffians, that's weird.

14:05.390 --> 14:05.970
And a birdhouse?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.271
A birdhouse would be really good!

14:08.291 --> 14:09.412
Yeah, I like that.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.892
I guess they like shiny stuff, huh?

14:11.032 --> 14:12.433
I think a birdhouse would be good.

14:12.453 --> 14:15.134
Car keys, car keys too.

14:15.174 --> 14:16.375
Yeah, yeah.

14:17.075 --> 14:18.936
Oh well, there's lots of possibilities.

14:19.276 --> 14:19.356
Yes!

14:19.416 --> 14:22.857
Please check it out if you love Nerissa as much as we do!

14:22.998 --> 14:23.378
Yes!

14:23.858 --> 14:24.458
BAU BAU!

14:24.518 --> 14:26.619
BAU BAU!

14:26.779 --> 14:27.079
What?

14:27.519 --> 14:28.540
On the topic of a...

14:30.208 --> 14:31.729
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:46.953 --> 14:48.133
Wow!

14:49.374 --> 14:50.354
Ruffians!

14:50.894 --> 14:51.934
Shiori!

14:52.355 --> 14:57.136
Shiori released her 7-day cruise abroad!

14:58.856 --> 15:00.297
It was really, really funny.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.817
And really personal, too.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.558
I feel like we got to see a bit more of what Shiori was like.

15:04.598 --> 15:10.419
You know, she went on her cruise trip and we were like, Shiori, why?

15:10.499 --> 15:15.601
Before FUWAMOCO, we never ever even dreamed of going on a cruise trip before.

15:15.801 --> 15:16.001
No.

15:17.379 --> 15:24.586
I feel like she did a rather good job of selling us on the fact that cruises are not for us.

15:25.747 --> 15:26.667
Not for us.

15:26.767 --> 15:26.968
No.

15:27.968 --> 15:39.499
You know the idea of being trapped on a boat with thousands of people and only able to watch the performances and wait around in a pool and gamble and eat and drink.

15:39.959 --> 15:40.099
No.

15:42.001 --> 15:43.082
I don't think it's for us.

15:43.122 --> 15:43.162
No.

15:44.246 --> 15:46.188
We're demon guide dogs, not cruisers!

16:03.482 --> 16:04.723
Yeah, it was really cute.

16:04.963 --> 16:08.325
You know it's very professional with like a shiori flavor.

16:08.365 --> 16:09.186
Very, very cute.

16:09.206 --> 16:10.247
Tasted like a bookmark.

16:10.587 --> 16:10.887
What?

16:11.628 --> 16:15.070
It tastes like a bookmark with a shiori flavor.

16:15.090 --> 16:15.130
Oh.

16:18.032 --> 16:21.414
Well, we hope that she makes more vlogs, yeah?

16:21.454 --> 16:23.676
But we also want to stay close with her, you know?

16:24.617 --> 16:24.957
Yeah.

16:25.617 --> 16:25.737
Oh?

16:26.818 --> 16:30.401
Maybe a solution would be that

16:31.232 --> 16:35.953
We're taking an advent vacation trip somewhere all together!

16:36.133 --> 16:37.094
Advent trip.

16:37.134 --> 16:39.414
Would you like to see a vlog from something like that?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.455
That would be so chaotic.

16:41.555 --> 16:43.135
Are we sure we're gonna survive?

16:43.155 --> 16:44.196
I don't know.

16:44.656 --> 16:45.996
It'd be very, very chaotic.

16:46.256 --> 16:52.378
What happens if we went to like a lake and then we like, you know, threw the rocks into the lake?

16:52.418 --> 16:54.358
Yeah, yeah, like the, what's it?

16:54.378 --> 16:55.959
The rock, rock throwing.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.500
BAU BAU!

17:18.852 --> 17:21.834
Well, ruffians, we have more happy news!

17:21.854 --> 17:25.737
There's also something very exciting happening!

17:25.877 --> 17:27.518
This time there's no rocks involved.

17:27.758 --> 17:28.059
No!

17:28.079 --> 17:29.900
But there's watermelons.

17:30.515 --> 17:36.599
Because FUWAMOCO Suiko got an O.K.!

17:36.779 --> 17:42.583
And we just found out that FUWAMOCO has been included in the most- Yay!

17:42.703 --> 17:48.587
No, they added IA and IDEA members, but they chose us to represent Alphys!

17:48.788 --> 17:49.848
BAU BAU!

17:49.888 --> 17:52.230
We're so thankful!

17:52.250 --> 17:55.272
Is this the first FUWAMOCO appearance in a game?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.473
Really?

17:58.154 --> 17:59.435
Ruffians, you know.

18:02.278 --> 18:12.845
You know, and also what we very much appreciate is that even though we are twins and we do have only one YouTube channel between us, we're tweeted.

18:14.627 --> 18:18.349
We're treated as two different people, you know?

18:18.369 --> 18:20.151
Because we're individuals.

18:20.791 --> 18:21.552
I'm Mococo.

18:21.912 --> 18:22.672
I'm Fuwawa.

18:22.732 --> 18:23.333
Exactly.

18:23.793 --> 18:26.155
So that really means a lot to us too.

18:26.515 --> 18:27.876
It's important to us.

18:27.936 --> 18:28.837
But, but, but!

18:29.157 --> 18:31.939
Ruffians, do you also know what this club means?

18:35.205 --> 18:38.467
We hope that you're ready for some more holo no Suika!

18:38.487 --> 18:42.090
Yeah, cause we're gonna be playing it again sometime soon.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.531
Sometime soon, you know.

18:43.611 --> 18:43.932
Yeah.

18:43.952 --> 18:44.952
It's been a little while.

18:45.433 --> 18:46.053
It's been a little while.

18:46.073 --> 18:47.214
We wanna play more.

18:47.274 --> 18:47.374
Yeah.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.616
I feel hungry for the holo no Suika.

18:50.657 --> 18:52.578
We were just feeling like that the other day, huh?

18:52.598 --> 18:52.758
Right!

18:54.517 --> 18:55.978
It's the perfect time.

18:55.998 --> 19:03.121
I really wanted to say thank you to Ponzu and TKT Games for adding us to the game too.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.082
BAU BAU!

19:05.242 --> 19:06.203
Exciting!

19:06.723 --> 19:08.484
Great livestream probably not that soon.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.064
Don't worry.

19:10.184 --> 19:14.266
By soon enough, okay.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.967
BAU BAU!

19:16.227 --> 19:17.868
It's a good morning, right?

19:17.908 --> 19:19.829
Lots of exciting things happening.

19:22.019 --> 19:24.542
So many wonderful friends, too.

19:24.602 --> 19:26.704
Having exciting things happening.

19:27.344 --> 19:28.245
Very exciting times.

19:28.305 --> 19:30.006
Happiness by osmosis.

19:36.032 --> 19:37.733
And that's where it ends.

19:38.774 --> 19:39.515
If for goodness.

19:41.036 --> 19:41.957
Okay, ruffians.

19:42.477 --> 19:43.238
Ruffians!

19:44.359 --> 19:45.920
You have to tell us something, okay?

19:47.558 --> 19:57.301
You know that we've tried very, very, very hard recently not to make any more misunderstandings, right?

19:57.641 --> 20:02.142
And you think we've done a good job, right?

20:02.822 --> 20:04.042
We've done well, right?

20:04.963 --> 20:05.483
Right.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.764
We've been doing a good job, no more misunderstandings!

20:10.804 --> 20:14.145
By the way, seeing comments being like, yes, you did a good job, Mococo!

20:22.111 --> 20:24.332
Anyways!

20:24.352 --> 20:33.676
This wasn't supposed to happen, but... It was Nerissa's birthday, right?

20:35.017 --> 20:35.757
And of course!

20:36.157 --> 20:36.958
We talked about it!

20:37.198 --> 20:38.679
We wanted to get her a present!

20:40.319 --> 20:45.582
But you know... People always like it when you make something special for them, right?

20:46.598 --> 20:47.679
It was from the heart.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.781
You know, so we did!

20:50.801 --> 20:51.642
We did that.

20:52.182 --> 20:55.485
We gave her a special FUWAMOCO birthday coupon.

20:57.386 --> 20:58.567
Just like that!

20:58.948 --> 20:59.808
Like that.

21:00.649 --> 21:02.670
Yeah, birthday coupon!

21:02.751 --> 21:04.072
Birthday coupon.

21:04.112 --> 21:05.212
That's something normal.

21:05.493 --> 21:06.533
Birthday coupon.

21:06.634 --> 21:10.517
You know, so that she can redeem it for one touch.

21:11.017 --> 21:14.320
That's only one touch between the both of us.

21:14.340 --> 21:14.560
Yeah.

21:15.379 --> 21:16.639
Not one touch, Fuwawa.

21:17.039 --> 21:17.940
One touch, Mococo.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.960
No, no, no.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.320
Only one touch.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.201
Just one touch.

21:22.281 --> 21:22.561
Yeah.

21:23.061 --> 21:28.502
And you know, on the back of the coupon, it says, no ears, no tail.

21:28.562 --> 21:28.782
No.

21:29.362 --> 21:29.802
Yeah.

21:30.303 --> 21:30.583
Yeah.

21:31.043 --> 21:32.363
But, ruffians!

21:33.603 --> 21:34.744
Ruffians!

21:35.664 --> 21:39.685
You've decided to erase Nerissa's name and put yours on it?

21:41.700 --> 21:41.880
Huh?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.521
What are you doing?

21:43.581 --> 21:45.561
What are you doing?

21:46.641 --> 21:47.741
Oh my gosh.

21:47.801 --> 21:48.122
No.

21:48.942 --> 21:51.682
This is Nerissa's birthday gift for her.

21:52.362 --> 21:53.063
Not yours.

21:53.383 --> 21:53.623
No.

21:54.403 --> 21:54.643
No.

21:55.663 --> 21:56.503
Can't do that.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.624
Can't do it.

21:58.004 --> 21:58.344
Can't.

21:58.464 --> 21:58.864
Yeah.

21:59.204 --> 22:06.726
And see, now, now ruffians, you're printing the coupons out by the hundreds, by the thousands!

22:06.786 --> 22:08.026
That's not okay!

22:08.066 --> 22:08.466
No, no.

22:10.146 --> 22:11.049
Oh my gosh.

22:11.750 --> 22:12.913
Ruffians!

22:12.973 --> 22:15.680
You know that's not how things work, right?

22:17.159 --> 22:17.419
Right.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.962
You know, I keep track of who gets coupons from me.

22:20.982 --> 22:26.987
So you can't just pretend and try to fool me by saying that I would've made a ton of coupons like that!

22:27.808 --> 22:28.908
It's special, okay?

22:29.509 --> 22:31.791
It's just for Nerissa, you know it!

22:32.311 --> 22:34.693
So you better be careful, okay?

22:35.033 --> 22:37.775
We'll remember those who try funny stuff, okay?

22:38.236 --> 22:39.817
I have a good memory, you know that.

22:39.837 --> 22:40.578
I do too.

22:40.938 --> 22:42.499
Even a better memory than Mococo-chan.

22:42.539 --> 22:44.281
Does it have to be a competition?

22:46.940 --> 22:47.380
Got it?

22:47.860 --> 22:49.161
Be careful, okay?

22:49.181 --> 22:49.861
Watch yourself.

22:50.222 --> 22:50.502
Yeah.

22:53.783 --> 22:56.284
You won't get past the eyes of FUWAMOCO, okay?

22:57.005 --> 22:58.485
Yeah.

22:58.505 --> 22:59.766
Demon guard dog eyes.

23:00.626 --> 23:01.487
BAU BAU.

23:01.647 --> 23:05.169
BAU BAU.

23:05.469 --> 23:05.769
Well.

23:06.529 --> 23:06.749
Well.

23:07.350 --> 23:10.111
Ruffians, you know how to behave now, right?

23:10.131 --> 23:11.471
You know how to behave!

23:15.053 --> 23:16.554
You know how to behave!

23:19.571 --> 23:20.472
You always know how.

23:20.492 --> 23:21.472
Know it!

23:21.492 --> 23:21.813
Thank you.

23:22.073 --> 23:22.813
Thank you.

23:22.954 --> 23:23.514
Know it!

23:23.554 --> 23:25.556
That one ruffian said yes.

23:25.856 --> 23:26.937
They always have.

23:27.457 --> 23:28.838
And I believe you.

23:29.038 --> 23:29.559
I trust you.

23:29.579 --> 23:30.319
I believe you, okay?

23:30.339 --> 23:31.900
I believe you.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.041
You'll behave too.

23:33.081 --> 23:33.822
You'll behave.

23:33.942 --> 23:35.703
Good, good, good, good.

23:35.823 --> 23:36.984
You do your best honest.

23:37.064 --> 23:41.407
That's good.

23:42.068 --> 23:42.849
Maybe.

23:43.569 --> 23:44.310
Maybe then.

23:46.986 --> 24:02.114
If you're being good, which I'm not sure about, but if you're being good, then if you need a little bit of a push, maybe, maybe I'll give it to you.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.778
Ruffians!

24:10.939 --> 24:12.039
Ruffians!

24:12.139 --> 24:13.540
Good morning!

24:14.591 --> 24:16.292
Good morning!

24:16.712 --> 24:17.313
You're up!

24:18.113 --> 24:19.714
It might still be dark out.

24:20.274 --> 24:22.596
It might still be cold outside of your bed.

24:23.316 --> 24:25.217
But, you did it!

24:25.858 --> 24:31.801
Now, splash some water on that cute face of yours and let's get ready to make today ours!

24:32.622 --> 24:35.563
You made it this far in the week, and that's amazing!

24:36.224 --> 24:38.965
No matter how hard each day is, you keep going.

24:39.466 --> 24:41.387
And you really need to give yourself some credit for that.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.632
But also!

24:44.353 --> 24:48.457
It's important to know when you need to give yourself a bit of time to rest and recover, okay?

24:49.538 --> 24:50.820
Don't think of it as a break.

24:51.761 --> 24:55.184
Think of it as another important duty to keep yourself going.

24:55.765 --> 24:56.145
Okay?

24:57.707 --> 24:59.208
But, do it.

25:00.410 --> 25:05.295
Do also make sure to give yourself an actual break to do the things that you like.

25:06.303 --> 25:07.943
It's an important break for your heart!

25:08.603 --> 25:10.964
And you know, your heart is precious.

25:11.604 --> 25:16.845
You need to keep it healthy, and safe, and warm up every day, okay?

25:18.325 --> 25:20.066
Anyways, it's Wednesday!

25:20.086 --> 25:22.266
The weekend is almost here!

25:23.046 --> 25:28.688
Let's warm up the body for the day, warm up our hearts with a smile, and tackle the day!

25:29.248 --> 25:30.228
You can do it!

25:31.008 --> 25:34.349
I believe that you'll get past any obstacles you come across today.

25:34.849 --> 25:35.149
Okay?

25:36.124 --> 25:37.384
You're amazing!

25:37.965 --> 25:39.125
You can do it!

25:39.605 --> 25:41.706
Let's do it all together, okay?

25:41.726 --> 25:43.507
Ganbatte da!

25:43.547 --> 25:48.508
BAU BAU!

25:48.628 --> 25:51.749
Let's do it all together today!

25:52.950 --> 25:57.351
BAU BAU!

25:57.531 --> 25:59.772
We have our Doggie of the Day next.

25:59.812 --> 26:00.753
Doggie of the Day!

26:00.853 --> 26:03.033
I want to see a cute doggy of today.

26:03.493 --> 26:04.734
Well, we have...

26:05.558 --> 26:07.520
De-den!

26:08.420 --> 26:08.961
Morgan!

26:09.601 --> 26:10.122
Morgan!

26:10.342 --> 26:12.243
Today's Doggie of the Day is Morgan.

26:12.263 --> 26:14.065
What's wrong with Morgan?

26:14.085 --> 26:15.086
Oh well...

26:17.668 --> 26:22.793
Morgan's kind of a bit gloomy because she doesn't like suitcases, you know?

26:23.413 --> 26:28.618
She sees a suitcase, she says, oh my gosh, am I going to be left behind?

26:29.058 --> 26:30.279
But that's not true!

26:31.040 --> 26:35.164
Yeah, but it doesn't still stop her from looking like the saddest puppy ever.

26:35.724 --> 26:39.548
You know, I can totally understand sometimes.

26:41.209 --> 26:41.970
Does she need a hug?

26:45.057 --> 26:47.518
I need to hug Morgan!

26:48.438 --> 26:52.539
You know, I also want to rub my fingers down the caramel streak on her head.

26:52.579 --> 26:55.040
You see right in between the eyes.

26:55.200 --> 26:55.640
Me too!

26:55.720 --> 26:56.760
Very cute.

26:56.780 --> 27:00.341
Caramel streak.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.622
Don't worry Morgan, it's okay.

27:04.862 --> 27:07.423
Well, um, how does Morgan BAU BAU?

27:07.463 --> 27:09.984
Maybe you know where she sees the suitcases?

27:11.204 --> 27:11.244
Ah.

Let's see, we have... De-den!

28:11.364 --> 28:11.884
Wow!

28:17.208 --> 28:20.169
It's another Mococo Sky!

28:21.090 --> 28:23.330
I feel like we've had a lot of Mococo Skies recently.

28:23.350 --> 28:24.031
I don't know.

28:24.151 --> 28:27.092
It's just the Mococo Sky kind of time of year, you know?

28:27.192 --> 28:29.573
Have I been missing out on calling every sky?

28:29.693 --> 28:31.473
It's a Fuwawa Sky!

28:31.494 --> 28:32.574
Have I?

28:32.594 --> 28:35.355
Just because it's blue, you can't call it a Fuwawa Sky, okay?

28:35.695 --> 28:37.036
I can and I want!

28:37.056 --> 28:37.736
You can!

28:37.756 --> 28:40.177
Ah, well, it's so pretty, you know?

28:40.197 --> 28:42.658
Early morning walks are really nice.

28:42.718 --> 28:43.318
Yeah!

28:43.358 --> 28:44.418
The air is so fresh.

28:44.438 --> 28:44.899
Fresh.

28:45.219 --> 28:45.799
No one's around.

28:46.243 --> 28:47.166
Ah, it's silent.

28:47.406 --> 28:49.833
Right, the world is ready for you to discover.

28:49.853 --> 28:50.936
Ah, it's just the birds.

28:53.034 --> 28:58.919
As for us watching the sunrise, well, we see the sunrise, ah, we saw it last, yes, today!

28:59.100 --> 28:59.980
Last, yes, yes.

29:01.401 --> 29:02.763
When did we see it?

29:02.803 --> 29:03.463
Today!

29:03.483 --> 29:04.124
Today!

29:04.204 --> 29:06.386
Yeah, we see it all the time, you know.

29:06.426 --> 29:07.547
I like to watch the sunrise.

29:07.567 --> 29:19.236
Yeah, especially mornings with the FUWAMOCO Morning, so... You know, sometimes, especially when you feel like, ah, I can't get out of bed, it's nice just to watch the sunrise or look outside at the sun.

29:20.097 --> 29:21.618
And then you feel a bit better, okay?

29:21.698 --> 29:25.660
And then there's the sometimes where you're like, looking really hard late at night.

29:26.240 --> 29:31.543
And then before you know it, you look outside and you're like, why are you... Why is the sun here, hai?

29:32.063 --> 29:33.884
Why'd you show your face here, hai?

29:33.904 --> 29:34.044
Yeah.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.145
Sometimes, sometimes.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.786
This sometimes, sometimes.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.137
Everyday sky is Fuwawa Sky.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.517
Thank you!

29:44.098 --> 29:45.759
And that sky is beautiful, right?

29:46.459 --> 29:47.300
Right?

29:47.380 --> 29:47.680
Right.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.502
Fuwawa Sky is beautiful, right?

29:50.542 --> 29:52.663
Mococo Sky is beautiful.

29:53.244 --> 29:56.486
BAU BAU!

29:57.726 --> 30:00.568
And for our question of the day, we have...

30:02.213 --> 30:03.434
De-den!

30:03.975 --> 30:04.976
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

30:05.116 --> 30:05.917
Hello!

30:06.158 --> 30:11.865
Is there any preferred clothing or fashion you like to wear in winter that you don't usually wear in the other seasons?

30:12.305 --> 30:14.528
We got this for a taste in fashion.

30:14.588 --> 30:14.868
What?

30:14.908 --> 30:18.532
So I'd like to see if you pass the test of this test.

30:18.933 --> 30:19.854
Thanks for the saves, Fuwawa!

30:19.874 --> 30:20.435
What do you mean?

30:21.616 --> 30:22.317
What do you mean?

30:22.697 --> 30:24.338
This for your fashion?

30:24.919 --> 30:26.280
We never said anything.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.542
We just said that black and black isn't good, right?

30:29.602 --> 30:31.563
Yeah, you want to be visible.

30:31.583 --> 30:32.964
Especially in the winter.

30:32.984 --> 30:35.226
Especially in the winter, you can't just wear all black.

30:35.266 --> 30:36.027
That's dangerous.

30:36.107 --> 30:37.968
That's dangerous, yeah.

30:37.988 --> 30:40.010
But winter clothing!

30:40.030 --> 30:43.372
Sweaters!

30:43.432 --> 30:43.812
Sweaters!

30:43.932 --> 30:44.533
Wow, that was a lot.

30:44.909 --> 30:45.550
Sweaters.

30:45.570 --> 30:45.970
Sweaters.

30:46.251 --> 30:50.395
Yeah, sweaters are great because they're warm and comfy and fluffy and fuzzy!

30:51.196 --> 30:51.877
They're cute.

30:52.037 --> 30:52.938
They're cute.

30:53.058 --> 30:55.081
Fluffy and fuzzy is good!

30:55.121 --> 31:00.647
You know, they're extra cute, especially when, you know, they have turtle bags, or they have the moist sleeves!

31:00.687 --> 31:02.149
You know, it's kinda long and...

31:02.589 --> 31:05.911
It makes you feel more... You know, it has the vertical ribs.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.252
Not horizontal!

31:07.492 --> 31:08.092
Vertical ribs.

31:08.152 --> 31:09.613
Say that again!

31:09.633 --> 31:10.534
Vertical ribs.

31:10.554 --> 31:11.094
Say it again!

31:11.274 --> 31:12.375
Vertical ribs.

31:12.975 --> 31:13.715
Say it again!

31:13.956 --> 31:14.276
What?

31:14.296 --> 31:15.096
Not horizontal.

31:15.396 --> 31:16.917
Vertical.

31:20.839 --> 31:21.120
Yeah.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.460
Yeah!

31:22.760 --> 31:24.121
It's very cute!

31:24.181 --> 31:25.842
Ruffians, you agree, right?

31:25.862 --> 31:28.003
I did say vertical.

31:28.084 --> 31:28.964
Vertical.

31:32.722 --> 31:32.762
Hi!

31:32.782 --> 31:33.963
We wouldn't want that.

31:34.003 --> 31:35.083
We wouldn't, well...

32:02.335 --> 32:04.537
What's going on, ruffians?

32:04.777 --> 32:05.258
What's going on?

32:23.654 --> 32:25.855
Shiori is the word?

32:26.015 --> 32:27.936
That's not the word I wanted.

32:28.676 --> 32:29.376
But scarves!

32:29.777 --> 32:32.138
Scarves are great too!

32:34.018 --> 32:38.080
It's hard to find them, so sometimes it's best to make it yourself.

32:38.300 --> 32:47.184
But I like scarves that are so long that we can both wear them.

32:48.044 --> 32:50.185
One scarf for both of us!

32:53.331 --> 32:55.493
It works well.

32:55.673 --> 32:57.014
But it's very long.

32:57.394 --> 32:58.315
Very long.

32:58.335 --> 33:00.976
I think we passed your test.

33:01.036 --> 33:02.698
You can't say we didn't pass it.

33:02.958 --> 33:06.420
Peak fashion is when you wear a scarf for two people.

33:06.460 --> 33:06.720
Got it!

33:09.802 --> 33:11.163
BAU BAU!

33:11.243 --> 33:15.003
Thank you so much for all your submissions, Ruffians!

33:15.383 --> 33:24.185
Remember, we're always looking for more, so please use the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

33:24.425 --> 33:26.446
BAU BAU!

33:27.206 --> 33:31.647
Now for our next stream, we have De-den!

33:31.847 --> 33:35.268
Today we're gonna be taking the rest of the day to

33:36.755 --> 33:38.775
We need to make it special, Moco-chan.

34:05.979 --> 34:09.081
It doesn't need to be special ruffians!

34:09.482 --> 34:13.165
Wait, is it okay if it's just... just us?

34:14.827 --> 34:20.592
I guess that's a good question too.

34:20.732 --> 34:22.254
Every stream is special!

34:23.686 --> 34:25.969
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:26.649 --> 34:29.693
Coughed up ASMR!

34:29.733 --> 34:32.056
Just crunching, just crunching.

34:32.136 --> 34:32.757
Why?

34:33.758 --> 34:35.259
No just chatting, just crunching.

34:36.301 --> 34:39.164
But we hope that you'll join us and that you'll be really happy.

34:39.344 --> 34:39.644
BAU BAU!

34:57.558 --> 35:01.860
Ruffians, we talked about it a lot, but that's because this weekend is a big one for us!

35:02.320 --> 35:06.622
We have a collab, our first collab with Rui-ne-senpai!

35:06.882 --> 35:10.243
Because you know, it's twin day, and Rui-ne, she loves twins.

35:10.423 --> 35:14.485
And we're twins, so we're gonna talk about twins on twin day.

35:14.505 --> 35:21.008
But no pressure on Rui-ne-senpai to love us or anything, it's okay.

35:21.028 --> 35:22.568
There's a lot of twins in Hawaii.

35:22.628 --> 35:24.169
I don't know if we can fit that.

35:24.589 --> 35:25.849
It might already be full.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.030
It might be occupied.

35:27.563 --> 35:34.606
But after that too, we'll be having a new cover song coming out, a FUWAMOCO cover song.

35:35.186 --> 35:42.609
You know, and for us, these kind of times are very special to us, so we really hope that you'll be there.

35:42.629 --> 35:46.030
To be like, wow, FUWAMOCO, this is exciting!

35:46.110 --> 35:46.931
And listen to it.

35:47.091 --> 35:47.391
Yeah.

35:47.782 --> 35:48.202
Thank you.

35:48.242 --> 35:58.265
We really put a lot of work into it, so... And we're gonna continue to put a lot of work into it until we're able to share it with you, so... Please look forward to it!

35:58.385 --> 36:00.025
BAU BAU!

36:00.066 --> 36:01.466
We're gonna do our best!

36:01.886 --> 36:05.247
Thank you so much, FUWAMOCO!

36:05.767 --> 36:08.608
Well, I have a good feeling about today, right, Moco-chan?

36:08.648 --> 36:09.608
It's gonna be a good day.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.449
It's gonna be a good day, so let's do our best!

36:11.469 --> 36:13.969
Let's make it a good day all together, okay, Ruffians?

36:14.250 --> 36:15.130
All together!

36:16.030 --> 36:20.175
Ruffians, thank you for joining us for today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:20.756 --> 36:27.084
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special ruffians today!

36:28.487 --> 36:29.187
Aster.

36:29.387 --> 36:30.648
BAU BAU!

36:30.688 --> 36:31.448
Willow.

36:31.668 --> 36:33.009
BAU BAU!

36:33.329 --> 36:33.849
Reese.

36:34.129 --> 36:35.510
BAU BAU!

36:35.810 --> 36:36.610
Okami.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.050
BAU BAU!

36:38.230 --> 36:39.311
Colossus.

36:39.591 --> 36:41.132
BAU BAU!

36:41.152 --> 36:42.672
This boy.

36:42.972 --> 36:44.373
BAU BAU!

36:44.393 --> 36:45.633
Stick boy.

36:45.973 --> 36:47.514
BAU BAU!

36:48.074 --> 36:48.674
Asin.

36:49.014 --> 36:50.335
BAU BAU!

36:54.247 --> 37:00.030
And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

37:00.050 --> 37:02.110
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:02.170 --> 37:02.911
BAU BAU!
