00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:30.174

00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:31.396

00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:34.362
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:34.342 --> 00:05:37.988
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Shishirio!

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:39.671
And I'm not Mococo, I'm Gigi!

00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:42.236
Together we're CiciGigi!

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:43.578
BAU BAU!

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:47.264
And today we're your hosts of CiciGigi Morning!

00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:53.014
Thank you for joining us for our 167th episode!

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:54.156
Yay!

00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:03.393
I can't believe we've already been 167 episodes.

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.056
Wow, that's crazy.

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.438
That means that we can get royalties.

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:09.183
I don't even remember all of them.

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.625
There's just so many of them.

00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.410
Time passes by so quick, like an arrow.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.980
Introductions for all, for those that are joining us for the first time of GGCC.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:24.491
It is a short format podcast show.

00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:25.633
Very important.

00:06:26.214 --> 00:06:33.407
But we lost the keys to our office building, so we had to go to a different office building.

00:06:33.387 --> 00:06:34.649
But you don't need to care about that.

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:35.470
Don't worry about it.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.291
Don't worry about it.

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.594
I'm so happy they had the proper setup and everything.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:39.355
Yeah!

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.379
And it is held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.321
Mm-hmm.

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:43.862
CCGG.

00:06:44.282 --> 00:06:46.505
Hosted by... CCGG!

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:47.386

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:50.691
Brought to you today by... CCGG!

00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:54.937
And our aim is to bring **** to the entire **** world!

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:00.745
And what's really important is actually that you ****

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.371
That's all.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:08.376
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:12.022
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:07:12.483 --> 00:07:16.249
Let's make sure to start our day off on the right paw.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.797
And let's all BAU BAU to a brand new CCGG morning.

00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.845
BAU BAU!

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:26.466
Yay!

00:07:26.486 --> 00:07:29.972
First off, BAU BAU, we have

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.664
First off, we have a very very special sighting.

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:37.547
What could it be?

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:38.188
What could it be?

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:40.170
If only I could see it.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.193
If only I knew when I saw the sighting.

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:43.554
If only I saw what the sighting was.

00:07:43.574 --> 00:07:46.638
If only I could see it to my sight right now.

00:07:46.718 --> 00:07:48.881
I'm so excited!

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:49.421
It's a Pero sighting!

00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:52.585
We hate that guy!

00:07:54.235 --> 00:08:09.544
After work tonight, I went to Sesshio!

00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:11.447
To check out the Advent members' signatures.

00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:13.430
To my surprise, Pero was there too!

00:08:14.732 --> 00:08:16.414
So I pulled him in to join me right away.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:19.198
Maybe we can eat lots of shrimp sushi together?

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:19.959
No.

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:20.180
Pero.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.682
Disgusting foul beast.

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:22.563
It's a hard pass.

00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:23.144
Yes.

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:24.546
What were you doing there?

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.811
At the Sushiro Taiwan Advent collab?

00:08:29.113 --> 00:08:29.193
Huh?

00:08:29.213 --> 00:08:30.114
We should have been there.

00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:31.296
We should have been there.

00:08:31.316 --> 00:08:35.222
I should have been the one taking the photo with Fuwawa and Mococo.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:36.223
Yeah, we...

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:37.404
Advent.

00:08:37.504 --> 00:08:37.924
And CCGD.

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:38.886
And Justice.

00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:40.007
And everyone.

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:40.848
And everyone.

00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:41.529
I should have been there.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.751
I should have been eating all their plates.

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:44.433
I should have gotten all their merch.

00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:48.920
How do we get rid of Pero so that I could have been there instead?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.761
That should have been me.

00:08:50.101 --> 00:08:50.822
Maybe like lemons.

00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:51.884
Lemons?

00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:53.266
Lemons?

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:54.287
Lemons, yeah.

00:08:54.307 --> 00:08:55.910
Maybe water spray.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.530
I know that song.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.251
Spray bottle.

00:08:57.572 --> 00:08:57.932
Water.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:00.596
Maybe like really loud high-pitched noises.

00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:01.958
Maybe a firework.

00:09:01.938 --> 00:09:04.903
Don't they not like fireworks?

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:09.331
You drop a fork to the floor and it really scares him?

00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:10.594
So scared!

00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:13.940
That's really scary.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.342
But yeah, it's okay.

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:17.326
Hopefully, Pero didn't eat all the food.

00:09:18.588 --> 00:09:22.275
Fat, fat!

00:09:22.964 --> 00:09:24.007

00:09:40.268 --> 00:09:40.348
Hey!

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:45.237
I'm sure that everyone would love to see it at hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:49.986
That's probably not the right hashtag, but you should put it in there anyway for us to see.

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:52.030
Just put it in there anyway.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.673
Just flood the hashtag.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:54.134
Put it there.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:59.504
If you're wondering what hashtag #FWMCMORNING stands for because it's like, oh, that's not your name.

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:03.872
It actually stands for friends with my car.

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.881
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:09.204
That's us, that's our brand.

00:10:09.224 --> 00:10:10.767
FUWAMOCO Yep, that's our brand.

00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:12.570
Anyways, moving on to the next thing.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.836
BAU BAU!

00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:17.119
What else is on the list?

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:19.363
Hold on, shuffling my papers on my podcast.

00:10:20.963 --> 00:10:21.945
Oh, it looks here.

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.311
Oh, I see an armpit.

00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:25.133
Oh, an armpit.

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:26.797
You see an armpit?

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:27.940
Why are you seeing armpits?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.822
Don't worry about it.

00:10:29.403 --> 00:10:30.085
You'll see.

00:10:30.145 --> 00:10:32.771
You'll see what we see.

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:33.974
You may see.

00:10:35.037 --> 00:10:36.280
Armpits!

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.723
That's a lot of armpits.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:42.771
And ironically, when I saw the video the first time, first girl, whoa armpit!

00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.413
Second girl, whoa armpit!

00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:45.956
Whoa armpit!

00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:46.536
Whoa armpit!

00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:48.560
That's a lot of armpit!

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.502
That's a lot of armpit!

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:56.972
If you did not know, Advent released a cover of Hot Limit by TM Revolution.

00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:57.433
Hot Limit!

00:10:57.413 --> 00:11:17.700
hololive English Official Channel.

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.073
I... I just... There's just so many... I'm striving with my audio.

00:11:23.093 --> 00:11:24.236
Oh, it's because you have different ears today!

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:26.201
Oh, I have different ears today.

00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:27.043
I just feel so different.

00:11:27.063 --> 00:11:31.234
I'm not used to having... Yeah, I'm not used to having such ears in such a way.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.862
But make sure to go check it out.

00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:35.404
I want and get ready for summer.

00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:36.806
It is a summer BOP!

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:39.029
It is a very cute dance animation.

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:41.692
You should all check it out.

00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:44.856
And they lift their arms and they show you their armpits in that one too.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.358
And they lift their legs.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.701
There's a lot going on.

00:11:48.982 --> 00:11:51.044
It's crazy.

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.447
There is no limit to the hotness.

00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:56.131
There is no limit to the hot limit.

00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:57.913
But there are...

00:11:59.142 --> 00:12:00.384
10 armpits.

00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:01.827
Did you just count?

00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.771
I had to remember.

00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:14.653
You were like 1, 2, 3, carry the 4, carry the 10 to the 8 armpits.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:20.523
Make sure to use hashtag #FWMCMORNING to talk about your favorite armpit.

00:12:21.024 --> 00:12:22.186
We'd love to read about it.

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:22.626
You have to pick one.

00:12:22.726 --> 00:12:23.948
You have to pick only one.

00:12:23.989 --> 00:12:27.334
Not a pair of armpits, a specific side.

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:32.683
You have to go, oh I really liked Fuwawa's left side armpit over the right side.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:37.992
But I think Mococo's right side armpit is also pretty darn good.

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:38.974
It's hard to pick.

00:12:39.054 --> 00:12:41.097
It's really hard to pick.

00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:44.922
We'd love to read about your thoughts and comments and prayers.

00:12:45.103 --> 00:12:46.665
Yes, please tell us about it.

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:48.567
That's enough about armpits.

00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:50.831
BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:53.735
And then, of course, what else happened?

00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:56.318
What else happened?

00:12:56.338 --> 00:13:01.245
If only a thing were to appear right before my eyes so I would know what happened.

00:13:01.305 --> 00:13:02.286
If only I could see.

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:07.033
It's Holonatsu and...

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.353
Wow!

00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:12.154
Check this out.

00:13:12.174 --> 00:13:13.475
There was a relay happening.

00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:14.176
Did you watch it?

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:15.758
It was really fun.

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:17.700
I watched it.

00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:20.683
You were also in it.

00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:21.764
Isn't that true?

00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:23.827
I was also in it, BAU BAU.

00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:25.689
Me too, BAU BAU.

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:30.073
It was non-stop summer fun with hololive.

00:13:30.173 --> 00:13:30.834
It was really fun.

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:31.395
It was really nice.

00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.757
Everyone did really well with the Midsummer Karaoke.

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:34.518
And lots of fun.

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:36.480
That one's me.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.303
You can tell by my ears!

00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:41.930
That's you!

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.932
This was my stream.

00:13:42.972 --> 00:13:45.156
I had a really good time doing this.

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:47.460
Your eye color is very vibrant.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.243
Did you wear contacts today?

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:51.207
Yes, I did wear contacts today.

00:13:51.728 --> 00:13:56.115
You might not know this, but the person behind me is you!

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.017
Where?

00:13:56.997 --> 00:14:20.406
Did you guys know that our relays were back-to-back?

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:23.190
Yeah, we're actually- Right next to each other.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.273
Yeah, it's because we're- And this was our thumbnail.

00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:27.015
Yeah, because we look so similar to each other.

00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:28.577
And this was our stream.

00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:34.265
I look really good actually.

00:14:34.746 --> 00:14:35.687
CC GG POV.

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:38.351
I look really good.

00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:39.553
You look really good.

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:41.215
I look so good.

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:44.380
She specially installed chest installments for this stream.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.604
Cause you know, as an automaton, she can swap off her breastplate.

00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:49.667
But she loves being flat.

00:14:49.647 --> 00:14:50.708
What do you mean flat?

00:14:50.768 --> 00:14:52.410
What are you talking about?

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.073
And then we had Buttsumo!

00:14:55.173 --> 00:14:56.054
Yay!

00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:57.435
Buttsumo!

00:14:57.455 --> 00:14:58.236
Did you guys know who was gonna win?

00:14:58.416 --> 00:14:59.177
Who were you betting on?

00:14:59.217 --> 00:15:00.839
Did you have a bet before?

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.602
I was actually guessing Suwano-senpai.

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:05.964
That was just my, I don't know, she's very energetic.

00:15:06.004 --> 00:15:06.925
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:10.629
Gives the vibe of someone that could butt bounce someone out.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.271
Butt bounce someone.

00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:14.613
Yeah, but, who did butt?

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.376
Butt, butt!

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:19.700
Don't make an ass of yourself!

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.334
Hey, that was kind of late.

00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:30.698
You gotta be on that button faster.

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:32.541
FORGET IT!

00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:33.643
BAU BAU!

00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:39.058
If you did not know, spoiler warning, the winner was Iofi.

00:15:39.078 --> 00:15:39.760
Iofi!

00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:41.262
Come on!

00:15:41.282 --> 00:15:41.983
Look at her dance.

00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:43.586
What?

00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:44.247
Stop!

00:15:44.648 --> 00:15:45.369
Damn.

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.529
Hey.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.493
Gat is not a bad word.

00:15:48.294 --> 00:15:51.600
Gat is a totally- It gives me brain damage.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.281
Oh, okay.

00:15:52.381 --> 00:15:53.944
So now it's all-

00:15:53.924 --> 00:15:56.287
She is the winner and now we're making it about you?

00:15:56.327 --> 00:15:57.929
You want to make it about yourself?

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.454
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.496
Oh, Iofi's won the butt sumo competition.

00:16:03.536 --> 00:16:04.678
Butt!

00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:04.958
Butt!

00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:07.461
I get it.

00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:09.284
It's a really good one.

00:16:09.624 --> 00:16:10.585
How did you come up with that one?

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:11.707
I don't know.

00:16:12.247 --> 00:16:13.048
It's spelled different.

00:16:13.068 --> 00:16:15.071
Well, how would you win if you were here?

00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:18.295
I think I would touch roll.

00:16:18.275 --> 00:16:19.517
You have to stay in the circle!

00:16:19.877 --> 00:16:21.199
Don't roll inside of the circle.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:21.860
Okay, okay.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.547
Don't roll into my enemies so they fall down, but I- I hit them with a butt first, you know?

00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:29.311
You roll, you hit them with a butt, and then they- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:30.572
Hit the ankles, and then they fall down.

00:16:30.592 --> 00:16:39.004
I think the way that I would win is that on the way to the offices at- in the parking lot, in the metaphorical parking lot- You hit them with your car?

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:39.365
No, no.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:43.431
I would be beating someone up in the parking lot, so then they're really scared of me.

00:16:43.891 --> 00:16:45.193
And then when they go in, they're like,

00:16:45.173 --> 00:16:47.498
Oh no, they're really scared.

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:48.860
Oh, that's a good idea.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.904
Yeah, so you have to intimidate them before.

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:55.633
Okay, but what if they take it as a challenge and they're not intimidated by you because you're kind of small and pink?

00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:57.016
Forget it, BAU BAU.

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.882
Okay, I guess we should forget it.

00:17:00.403 --> 00:17:01.445
And then, what else did we do?

00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:05.713
We took part in the Horonatsu Queen VR Chat Tournament!

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:08.256
Yay!

00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:08.676
That was really fun.

00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:09.437
It was lots of fun.

00:17:09.497 --> 00:17:11.559
It was really chaotic and awesome.

00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:13.321
Fuwawa drowned Mococo.

00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:13.881
Did you see that?

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:14.662
That's really weird.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:15.403
Why would she do that?

00:17:15.783 --> 00:17:16.684
That's crazy.

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:18.506
Someone drowned someone.

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:19.567
That's crazy.

00:17:19.587 --> 00:17:20.848
Someone did drown someone.

00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:21.649
We didn't though.

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.430
We didn't.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.472
Yeah, it was that pair.

00:17:24.592 --> 00:17:25.493
Always up to no good.

00:17:25.513 --> 00:17:27.134
I think Ina was a part of that too.

00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:27.995
Yeah, Ina was there.

00:17:28.176 --> 00:17:28.776
Can't believe it.

00:17:28.976 --> 00:17:29.877
Can't believe she would do that.

00:17:29.997 --> 00:17:31.179
I just cannot believe it.

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:34.021
And there was also a winner to this holonatsu summer.

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:35.683
It was Mono-sama!

00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:57.908
Bye!

00:17:57.888 --> 00:18:00.473
BAU BAU!

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:12.695
Did you guys know?

00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:19.187
At the very end of it, there was a song released on the official hololive channel!

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:39.758
FUWAMOCO Summer Time!

00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:52.057
I was like, I don't even know what it was, but she came close to me and I was like trying to look at her tummy and then I looked up and I was like, whoa!

00:18:52.077 --> 00:18:53.700
What's going on here?

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.805
I know, I had to do my best to stare in her eyes the entire time.

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:57.726
Yeah, you're so brave.

00:18:57.766 --> 00:18:58.187
Thank you.

00:18:58.207 --> 00:18:58.568
So strong.

00:18:58.788 --> 00:19:02.874
Well, that was HoloNatsu Summer!

00:19:04.657 --> 00:19:06.420
Please check out the music video.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.142
BAU BAU!

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:10.145
BAU BAU!

00:19:10.165 --> 00:19:10.325
BAU BAU!

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:11.026
BAU BAU!

00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:11.867
What's next?

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:16.352
The hololive World Tour!

00:19:16.452 --> 00:19:18.855
hololive World Tour Synchronized Continues!

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:23.001
Yeah, they just had a really, really, really, really successful performance in Hong Kong.

00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:26.545
With Sora-chan, Miku-senpai, Ben, Kubo-senpai.

00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:28.027
It was a meet and greet.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:31.050
Everyone was really... Very cute.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.033
Impressed with their Cantonese skills.

00:19:33.053 --> 00:19:33.834
I heard differently.

00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:36.357
They spoke...

00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:40.562
And they had a performance and they got to sing and answer many questions that you had!

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:41.444
You had!

00:19:45.654 --> 00:19:46.897
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:49.903

Every time it happens.

00:19:54.494 --> 00:20:01.466
We go through hashtag #FWMCMORNING and take the questions and we answer them on our podcast.

00:20:01.726 --> 00:20:02.307
We do that.

00:20:02.548 --> 00:20:05.012

00:21:00.538 --> 00:21:00.619
Yay!

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:04.425
It marks the second anniversary of Abyss!

00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:05.787
And it's been how many years?

00:21:06.508 --> 00:21:06.629
Two?

00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:09.413
Can we do one?

00:21:09.513 --> 00:21:10.435

00:21:11.123 --> 00:21:40.658

FUWAMOCO and Advent have a bunch of plans, but FUWAMOCO are kicking off the celebration with a countdown!

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:02.336
Woah, maybe you should use hashtag #FWMCMORNING to spread the word.

00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:04.238
Yeah, you should talk about it and listen to it.

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.479
And what kind of goals?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.182
Maybe, just maybe.

00:22:08.242 --> 00:22:10.365
Flood the hashtag!

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:11.346
Flood it!

00:22:11.366 --> 00:22:12.447
This is just a bunch of bots.

00:22:12.507 --> 00:22:13.348
Don't do it, don't do it.

00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:17.253
Maybe you guys should try and guess what the announcements are and hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:22:17.273 --> 00:22:19.595
Oh, that's a good idea, yeah.

00:22:19.615 --> 00:22:24.521
And we're sure that there'll be a lot of more exciting stuff, so get excited for that!

00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:24.921
Yay!

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:49.491
BAU BAU!

00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:50.795
What am I doing with these ears?

00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:51.717
There's too many of them.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.081
I'm so sensitive.

00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:53.903
I hear too much.

00:22:54.064 --> 00:22:55.708
I'm getting sensory overload.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:57.373
With my double pigtails.

00:22:58.055 --> 00:22:59.418
It's just so much going on.

00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:02.647
And they will be starting soon.

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:03.469
This week.

00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:04.171
Very soon.

00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:04.813
Super soon.

00:23:04.793 --> 00:23:06.295
Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:07.557
Do you think Gigi Murin is ready?

00:23:07.838 --> 00:23:08.098
No.

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.101
Gigi Murin is not ready.

00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:11.804
Do you think Gigi Murin will be nervous?

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:12.465
No.

00:23:12.785 --> 00:23:14.788
Gigi Murin will not be ready and will not be nervous.

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:16.831
She will be sleeping.

00:23:17.472 --> 00:23:18.554
Oversleeps.

00:23:18.614 --> 00:23:19.255
Doesn't show up.

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:22.320
It's just like a loading screen for one hour.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.523
She's not showing up.

00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:27.725
That would be, you know, monumental in one way.

00:23:27.745 --> 00:23:28.768
Yeah, it would be monumental.

00:23:29.048 --> 00:23:33.819
And then, remember, get ready for the next week after that, for it is Cecilia Imogreen.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.401
What?

00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.263
That's great!

00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:36.525
She looks great!

00:23:36.546 --> 00:23:37.407
And Raora Pantera.

00:23:37.508 --> 00:23:39.252
And then a Justice collab!

00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:39.472
Yay!

00:23:39.633 --> 00:23:40.294
Woohoo!

00:23:40.314 --> 00:23:40.875
It'll be very awesome.

00:23:41.697 --> 00:23:41.838
Yeah.

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:42.900
If I knew them.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.864
I've never seen them in my life.

00:23:45.084 --> 00:23:45.305
Who?

00:23:46.107 --> 00:23:46.267
Who?

00:23:46.287 --> 00:23:47.610
Get ready for Justice Greed Easto!

00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:49.894
BAU BAU!

00:23:50.035 --> 00:23:51.958
We had to hustle, we're running over time.

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:52.840
Oh we're running over time.

00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:56.428
They're about to kick us out.

00:23:56.588 --> 00:23:57.430
Literally.

00:23:58.512 --> 00:24:01.177
But we have one very important thing that we have to do.

00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:02.560
It is...

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.483
The Autofister Pup Talk!

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:07.185
Ruffians!

00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:08.407
It's that time again!

00:24:08.427 --> 00:24:12.271
It's time for Autofister Pup Talk!

00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:14.834
And you're going to hear it straight from us!

00:24:15.315 --> 00:24:17.137
Autofisters!

00:24:22.984 --> 00:24:23.164
Ruffians!

00:24:23.184 --> 00:24:24.386
Okay, okay, okay.

00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:26.168
Do you wanna?

00:24:26.188 --> 00:24:26.869
No, you go first.

00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:27.509
Okay, I'll go first.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.712
So, everyone.

00:24:30.097 --> 00:24:32.600
Today's autofist of Pup Talk.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.180
Don't do it.

00:24:33.581 --> 00:24:34.101
As every episode.

00:24:34.121 --> 00:24:34.722
Stay alive.

00:24:35.443 --> 00:24:38.005
Yes, but also don't worry about it too much.

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.127
Don't worry about things too much.

00:24:39.287 --> 00:24:40.028
Take your time.

00:24:40.268 --> 00:24:41.149
Don't pull the plug on your life.

00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:42.570
There's always going to be someone better than you.

00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:43.131
You got this.

00:24:43.211 --> 00:24:44.252
Do not compare yourself to others.

00:24:45.053 --> 00:24:46.695
Comparison is the thief of joy.

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.136
Don't pull the plug on your life.

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.598
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:51.460
Don't go into the deep pool.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.522
Don't go there.

00:24:53.502 --> 00:24:55.204
Stay here with us.

00:24:55.224 --> 00:24:56.485
Be happy.

00:24:56.585 --> 00:24:58.547
No but for real though.

00:24:58.887 --> 00:25:00.049
Be happy.

00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:00.869
Be whimsical.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.471
And BAU BAU.

00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:04.593

00:25:14.003 --> 00:25:16.125
You can do it!

00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:19.088

00:25:19.372 --> 00:25:21.198

Yo, I know everyone's been waiting for this one.

00:25:24.309 --> 00:25:25.474
The Doggie of the Day.

00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:26.878
Today's Doggie of the Day.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:27.721
Wow.

00:25:28.063 --> 00:25:30.592
Got my hololive expert collab hat and hat.

00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:31.575
Hajimaru.

00:25:32.062 --> 00:25:35.387
Fuzzy model.

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:40.354
This is, I rate this dog a good pupper.

00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:41.616
A good boy.

00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:42.998
A bow dog.

00:25:43.158 --> 00:25:47.685
A good fuzzy doggy with a cool hat.

00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:52.172
Cool, awesome, sexy hat.

00:25:52.572 --> 00:25:53.394
Don't say sexy.

00:25:53.414 --> 00:25:54.195
Sexy hat.

00:25:54.215 --> 00:25:54.776
Don't say sexy.

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:56.398
That's a pretty sexy hat.

00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:01.806
Okay.

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:02.568
They're kicking me out.

00:26:03.251 --> 00:26:04.435
We're about to be kicked out.

00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:09.612
About to be kicked out.

00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:15.409
Oh, we have to name the dog!

00:26:15.469 --> 00:26:16.550
You fool!

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.011
The name- the dog has a name!

00:26:18.031 --> 00:26:19.032
It says Fuzzy!

00:26:19.512 --> 00:26:20.934
It had Fuzzy- no!

00:26:21.194 --> 00:26:21.995
No, it's Fuzzy!

00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.816
Oh, you want to name it anyways?

00:26:23.836 --> 00:26:24.277
No, no!

00:26:24.297 --> 00:26:25.618
Give him a second name!

00:26:25.638 --> 00:26:29.601
No, it had Fuzzy Model for me because it's a fuzzy model!

00:26:29.681 --> 00:26:30.742
Oh, it's an adjective!

00:26:30.802 --> 00:26:32.384
Yay!

00:26:33.084 --> 00:26:33.625
It's an adjective!

00:26:33.645 --> 00:26:34.185
The real name of this dog!

00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:36.547
So, what do you want to- Hot dog.

00:26:36.747 --> 00:26:37.828
Hot dog.

00:26:38.069 --> 00:26:38.909
Oh, I like that.

00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:39.450
Yeah, I like that.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.151
I think that's a really good- Ketchup and mustard hot dog.

00:26:41.191 --> 00:26:42.192
That's a really good name!

00:26:42.212 --> 00:26:43.193
Hot dog for sure.

00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:43.814
BAU BAU!

00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:44.975
So cute!

00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:49.199
How does hot dog BAU BAU?

00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:54.184
BAU BAU!

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:57.788
That's really good.

00:26:58.068 --> 00:27:01.031
Wait, it's like hot dog is in here with us.

00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:02.733
Like hot dog is here with us.

00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:03.713
It's time for a rating.

00:27:04.935 --> 00:27:10.260
Hot dog gets a dog out of 10.

00:27:10.932 --> 00:27:11.573
She's dying.

00:27:14.136 --> 00:27:14.316
BAU BAU!

00:27:14.336 --> 00:27:16.179
BAU BAU!

00:27:16.199 --> 00:27:19.163
Oh, our next segment we have today I went for a walk.

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:21.946
Let's look at this walk today.

00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:23.668
You think it was actually today?

00:27:23.728 --> 00:27:24.469
Yes.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.753
They would not lie to us and hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:28.875
Yeah, of course not.

00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:33.060
Today I went on a walk to the Capilano Suspension Bridge in Vancouver.

00:27:33.281 --> 00:27:36.805
Was terrified of the heights but promised my family I would do it.

00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:37.747
Facing my fears.

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:38.669
Why are you laughing at them?

00:27:38.709 --> 00:27:39.691
They faced their fears.

00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:40.893
I wasn't laughing at them!

00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:42.697
There's technical things going on.

00:27:42.717 --> 00:27:43.839
I wasn't laughing at them.

00:27:43.859 --> 00:27:46.544
I would do it facing my fear of heights one step at a time.

00:27:46.885 --> 00:27:48.007
You did good, Ruffian.

00:27:48.047 --> 00:27:48.768
Yeah, you did really good.

00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:50.171
Face your fears.

00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:54.359
I think facing your fears is really good and I think fear of heights must be really terrifying.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.325
I used to be scared of heights and I faced my fears.

00:27:57.305 --> 00:27:58.546
Should I pick you up?

00:27:59.147 --> 00:28:01.149
Don't do it!

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.331
Don't touch me!

00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:05.353
But yeah, that's so pretty!

00:28:05.673 --> 00:28:07.074
It's very beautiful.

00:28:07.335 --> 00:28:10.878
I wish I was there at the suspension bridge with all the trees and all the forest.

00:28:11.178 --> 00:28:13.040
Could we jump into the water and have a swim?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.883
No, don't jump.

00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:16.424
BAU BAU!

00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:17.485
BAU BAU!

00:28:17.805 --> 00:28:21.388
Okay, next we have the Question of the Day!

00:28:21.428 --> 00:28:25.152
Today's question is...

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:32.998
Today's question is...

00:28:38.058 --> 00:28:39.560
Oh there it is!

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.902
Question of the Day.

00:28:41.863 --> 00:28:42.684
CCGigi!

00:28:42.964 --> 00:28:43.365
Hello!

00:28:43.605 --> 00:28:44.807
I have a question for you two.

00:28:45.087 --> 00:28:48.632
You know a lot of Japanese food, but how did you know Japanese food?

00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:53.458
I looked on the internet and I messaged one and I asked, do you want to meet up?

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:54.419
Yeah.

00:28:54.439 --> 00:28:55.480
So we're talking right now.

00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:55.921
Yeah.

00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:56.922
Talking stage?

00:28:57.002 --> 00:28:57.223
Yep.

00:28:57.523 --> 00:28:58.204
Whoa!

00:28:58.224 --> 00:29:01.348
I'm currently talking to an omelette.

00:29:01.328 --> 00:29:02.270
Excellent!

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:08.321
And I'm also talking to a salad right now, and I asked a question like, how do you like being dressed?

00:29:11.646 --> 00:29:12.688
Did the salad wink at you?

00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:13.550
Yeah.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:14.331
Wow.

00:29:14.351 --> 00:29:15.073
What about you?

00:29:15.473 --> 00:29:18.018
I've been talking to a donut.

00:29:18.258 --> 00:29:18.960
What kind of donut?

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.708
And then I say where there's a...

00:29:25.628 --> 00:29:27.470
Yeah, very yummy donut actually.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.852
Very, very yummy.

00:29:29.933 --> 00:29:33.598
Oh, I was also talking to Yakiniku!

00:29:33.758 --> 00:29:35.661
Yakiniku!

00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:35.781
Yeah!

00:29:35.801 --> 00:29:36.662
I love Yakiniku!

00:29:36.682 --> 00:29:38.004
We love Yakiniku!

00:29:38.104 --> 00:29:44.832
We always go to yummy places with some very beautiful dogs sometimes and we get Yakiniku with these beautiful dogs.

00:29:44.852 --> 00:29:50.219
They may or may not have invited us and fed us yummy Yakiniku.

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:50.860
It was delicious.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.262
Very delicious yummy yaki.

00:29:52.342 --> 00:29:54.927
I mean, we have this podcast, we need to eat, right?

00:29:54.987 --> 00:29:56.549
Sometimes you just need to eat.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.974
Sometimes you need, you got to eat.

00:29:59.474 --> 00:30:02.159
Well, thank you so much for all your submissions, Ruffians.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:07.387
Remember, FWMCMORNING is something we make together.

00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:16.763
And don't forget to use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING to share your doggy of the days, your daily vlogs, your questions,

00:30:16.743 --> 00:30:19.227
And unfortunate Pero Sightings.

00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:20.068
Unfortunately.

00:30:20.388 --> 00:30:21.390
Maybe FUWAMOCO will cry.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.331
We might cry.

00:30:22.652 --> 00:30:23.393
Please make them happy.

00:30:23.413 --> 00:30:24.154
Make them so happy.

00:30:24.194 --> 00:30:24.915
We mean it though.

00:30:24.935 --> 00:30:26.057
And make us happy too.

00:30:26.077 --> 00:30:26.998
I'm taking out my gun.

00:30:27.339 --> 00:30:27.619
Yes.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.224
Post more on the hashtag #FWMC.

00:30:31.245 --> 00:30:31.745
Where'd you get that guy?

00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:32.486
Oh you know.

00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:37.654
Hands up emoji.

00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:47.350
Make sure to use hashtag #FWMCMORNING if you want to be a part of their FWMCMORNING!

00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:49.955
BAU BAU!

00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:52.479
And then, for the next stream!

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.673
Actually, FUWAMOCO are going to do a countdown to start the second anniversary celebration!

00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:00.773
Yay!

00:31:00.753 --> 00:31:07.540
So it will be lots of announcements, countdowns, antics, and much much much more!

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.981
FUWAMOCO Anniversary!

00:31:09.001 --> 00:31:12.825
Yeah, but first they'll be looking at the list of over 100 goals.

00:31:12.845 --> 00:31:13.646
That's a lot.

00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:14.186
Lots of goals.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:14.827
And I still remember.

00:31:14.847 --> 00:31:15.948
Because they're very ambitious.

00:31:16.048 --> 00:31:17.630
And it was like so many.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.311
I was like whoa.

00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:19.051
I remember that word.

00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:19.532
I do.

00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:20.413
Word web.

00:31:20.713 --> 00:31:21.113
Word web.

00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:22.675
That's what it's called.

00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:23.676
I don't know what it's called.

00:31:23.696 --> 00:31:24.537
The think map.

00:31:24.557 --> 00:31:25.478
Think map?

00:31:25.518 --> 00:31:26.239
Yeah yeah yeah.

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:26.959
Okay.

00:31:26.979 --> 00:31:28.701
I think not.

00:31:32.258 --> 00:31:33.820
But yeah, it's a lot of goals.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.584
I am actually really curious how many they achieved.

00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:42.252
So make sure to tune in as they go over all 100 of their goals and add more because they love doing things.

00:31:42.632 --> 00:31:42.852
Yeah!

00:31:42.872 --> 00:31:44.555
Be there or be in my square!

00:31:44.575 --> 00:31:45.977
BAU BAU!

00:31:46.377 --> 00:31:48.340
And then there's their schedule as well.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.481
Make sure to check out their schedule.

00:31:49.501 --> 00:31:51.104
There's gonna be a maid cafe.

00:31:51.184 --> 00:31:51.905

00:31:52.005 --> 00:31:52.445

00:32:08.889 --> 00:32:13.578
Some mysterious things and well-to-appearance in FUWAMOCO too!

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:16.304
This is gonna be a jam-packed week, Ruffians!

00:32:16.324 --> 00:32:20.312
So make sure to log in and make sure you can watch all of their streams!

00:32:20.853 --> 00:32:22.716
Get no sleep, okay?

00:32:23.278 --> 00:32:24.540
Watch everything!

00:32:25.364 --> 00:32:26.526
Yeah, you have to watch everything.

00:32:27.147 --> 00:32:28.029
I'll be watching everything.

00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:29.732
Gotta observe them.

00:32:32.877 --> 00:32:34.039
For the Ruffians.

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:36.624
Even if you're not watching live right now.

00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:37.586
Even in the archive.

00:32:37.766 --> 00:32:39.148
Yes, yes.

00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:41.152

00:32:48.247 --> 00:32:50.831
That was good.

00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:52.214
We went way over time.

00:32:52.254 --> 00:32:53.937
They're really taking us out.

00:32:54.397 --> 00:32:58.524
Thank you for joining today for CCGGMorning!

00:32:58.725 --> 00:33:03.953
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

00:33:03.993 --> 00:33:06.598

Producer said we can name more than five.

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:28.385
We can name as many as we want.

00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:29.286
As many as we want.
