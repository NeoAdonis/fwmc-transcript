05:12.315 --> 05:14.356
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:14.857 --> 05:18.299
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:18.620 --> 05:22.062
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.122 --> 05:24.143
BAU BAU!

05:24.884 --> 05:28.066
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:28.326 --> 05:30.768
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:30.828 --> 05:33.010
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:34.190 --> 05:40.213
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:40.373 --> 05:44.094
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 59th episode!

05:44.254 --> 05:45.615
BAU BAU!

05:46.115 --> 05:50.697
Ruffians, are you awake?

05:51.257 --> 05:51.577
What?

05:52.330 --> 05:52.970
Really?

05:54.011 --> 05:57.132
It's been a little bit of a rough 24 hours, FUWAMOCO-chan.

05:57.752 --> 06:00.894
But thank you, Ruffians, for joining us!

06:01.254 --> 06:04.355
Maybe there's some first-time Ruffians out there, too.

06:04.476 --> 06:12.919
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show that will be Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:13.159 --> 06:14.500
Monday!

06:14.920 --> 06:15.440
Monday!

06:18.541 --> 06:20.001
It's not Monday today, Moco-chan.

06:20.402 --> 06:22.822
Today, it's Wednesday!

06:23.482 --> 06:24.243
Yeah.

06:24.423 --> 06:25.923
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.304
Is also known as FUWAMOCO.

06:28.504 --> 06:29.564
Yeah.

06:29.624 --> 06:32.345
FUWAMOCO Morning is hosted by us!

06:33.105 --> 06:34.686
FUWAMOCO!

06:34.986 --> 06:36.846
Say FUWAMOCO again!

06:36.906 --> 06:37.887
FUWAMOCO.

06:38.247 --> 06:39.007
FUWAMOCO!

06:54.032 --> 06:58.334
I aim is to bring a smile to your face.

06:58.654 --> 07:02.256
I hope you start your day off on the right paw.

07:02.316 --> 07:06.259
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

07:08.960 --> 07:12.822
It's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:13.062 --> 07:13.962
BAU BAU!

07:13.982 --> 07:15.003
BAU BAU!

07:15.083 --> 07:16.403
BAU BAU!

07:16.423 --> 07:16.863
BAU BAU!

07:16.883 --> 07:18.544
Don't mock me, okay?

07:18.744 --> 07:19.584
I won't mock you.

07:19.604 --> 07:23.746
It's my duty as a little sister, right, Ruffians?

07:25.387 --> 07:26.447
I have the right to mock.

07:26.767 --> 07:27.768
I don't think so.

07:28.468 --> 07:30.709
Uh-huh.

07:30.889 --> 07:31.449
Well!

07:32.169 --> 07:36.931
The Ruffians, apparently, they saw Pero again.

07:36.951 --> 07:37.792
Again?

07:38.012 --> 07:38.372
Really?

07:40.410 --> 07:42.391
Where is he this time, hoi?

07:42.831 --> 07:43.572
Well, let's see.

07:44.272 --> 07:47.834
De-den!

07:48.334 --> 07:49.555
Ruffians, look!

07:50.135 --> 07:53.177
Pero has a new part-time job.

07:53.777 --> 08:03.563
This time, he's doing the heartless work of being a Santa who has numerous kids sit on his lap and listen to what kind of toys and presents they want for Christmas.

08:06.194 --> 08:12.180
Ruffians, do you want to take a photo on Pero Santa's lap?

08:12.200 --> 08:15.303
Do you want to take a photo with Pero Santa?

08:15.923 --> 08:20.407
What do you think it'll feel like?

08:20.627 --> 08:24.010
I'm just curious, you know, would it be squishy?

08:24.050 --> 08:25.392
Would it make a sound?

08:25.892 --> 08:28.254
But he's a muscle.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.058
It could still be squishy.

08:32.748 --> 08:33.188
Hmm.

08:33.368 --> 08:35.289
Well, you do!

08:35.629 --> 08:36.110
What?

08:36.710 --> 08:37.270
What legs?

08:37.290 --> 08:38.231
He looks jolly?

08:38.331 --> 08:39.791
I usually don't mean jelly.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.373
I think Pero, you know, does he need legs?

08:43.833 --> 08:44.033
What?

08:44.213 --> 08:45.054
Does he need legs?

08:46.010 --> 08:48.331
He has wings, those are like skylights.

08:49.732 --> 09:01.118
Yeah, well, you know, Pero-san said he did bring us and the other Advent girls some gifts for Christmas, but he would never bring us what we wanted.

09:01.138 --> 09:09.902
You know, sometimes it was a bit disappointing to be honest.

09:10.694 --> 09:14.277
We're just happy to receive something, right?

09:14.677 --> 09:18.900
Because he probably tried his best.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.521
Ruffians!

09:20.541 --> 09:23.743
Do you know what you're asking for for Christmas?

09:25.485 --> 09:26.065
Do you?

09:26.125 --> 09:26.625
Do you?

09:26.645 --> 09:28.667
It's very important.

09:29.788 --> 09:34.371
You know, you better get ready before Moco Santa comes to town.

09:34.911 --> 09:35.852
Okay, I'll get ready.

09:36.857 --> 09:39.478
Good health, that's a good one.

09:39.558 --> 09:44.819
Steak and wine, not a bar of soap, are you sure?

09:45.939 --> 09:48.879
Well, Muffins, you better get thinking, okay?

09:48.899 --> 09:51.400
There's not much time, not much more time!

09:52.040 --> 09:53.820
BAU BAU!

09:55.861 --> 09:56.361
BAU BAU!

09:56.601 --> 09:58.701
Well, that's an interesting job, huh?

09:59.542 --> 10:01.422
It'd be fun, maybe.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.542
Yeah, I think so, Moco-chan.

10:05.023 --> 10:06.043
You wouldn't want to do that.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.611
I don't know.

10:08.851 --> 10:11.712
It's tough being a Santa, huh?

10:12.252 --> 10:12.952
Well!

10:13.713 --> 10:16.254
We have some exciting news!

10:16.274 --> 10:17.534
Ruffians!

10:17.934 --> 10:26.178
Tonight, we have the very first in a double upload of cover solo songs!

10:26.598 --> 10:27.278
Tonight!

10:30.896 --> 10:35.499
We released our cover of Shiro's Cute no Kanojo back in October, right?

10:36.099 --> 10:39.501
But I think Ruffians liked it quite a bit, right?

10:40.442 --> 10:40.942
Maybe.

10:40.962 --> 10:42.203
Just maybe.

10:42.623 --> 10:44.504
Thank you for all the feedback!

10:44.564 --> 10:46.045
We love you, Ruffians!

10:46.806 --> 10:55.851
But tonight, at 6pm PT, we'll be releasing a FUWAMOCO solo version, followed by a FUWAMOCO!

10:57.489 --> 10:59.629
Followed by me, Mococo!

11:00.650 --> 11:04.631
A Moco-chan version at the same time tomorrow, you know?

11:05.451 --> 11:15.113
And then you'll be able to listen to both of them very closely and get a good feel for the differences in our voices and, you know, our creative expressions, too.

11:15.153 --> 11:20.814
You know, sometimes it can be a bit tricky for some Ruffians, so maybe this will be a helpful guide in a sense.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.695
But you know...

11:25.275 --> 11:30.940
I'm so curious to see whose cover will be more popular.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.082
Get listening, Ruffians!

11:34.142 --> 11:34.622
BAU BAU!

11:34.742 --> 11:35.603
Exciting!

11:36.264 --> 11:38.225
Exciting!

11:38.866 --> 11:40.887
Well, also exciting is...

11:47.762 --> 11:48.862
The homework we gave you.

11:51.123 --> 11:52.124
That's right, Moco-chan.

11:52.144 --> 11:52.744
We gave homework.

11:52.864 --> 11:53.765
We gave homework.

11:53.865 --> 11:55.165
Ruffians!

11:55.185 --> 11:56.566
Did you finish it yet?

11:58.226 --> 12:02.728
We mentioned it last FUWAMOCO Morning, but we need your help again.

12:03.108 --> 12:08.991
You know, on Monday, we asked you to share your favorite holiday or Christmas memory with us, right?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.292
You remember, right?

12:11.472 --> 12:11.892
Right!

12:12.392 --> 12:12.712
Yeah!

12:14.353 --> 12:15.194
No forgetting.

12:15.214 --> 12:16.115
No forgetting.

12:16.155 --> 12:19.477
Yeah, we wanted to learn a little bit more about you.

12:19.777 --> 12:24.941
And so we're hoping that you'll share some of your memories with us and the Ruffians too.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.262
You can't finish it?

12:27.603 --> 12:31.345
I think you mean I can finish it.

12:31.846 --> 12:33.607
Yeah, you are.

12:33.647 --> 12:37.570
Well, we opened up a Google Form for you to fill in.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.611
There's only a few simple rules.

12:39.671 --> 12:40.252
Only a couple.

12:40.612 --> 12:40.852
BAU BAU!

12:58.709 --> 12:59.029
I see hope.

12:59.229 --> 13:01.811
I see hope that you haven't forgotten your memories.

13:27.825 --> 13:31.367
It might be hard to get to them all, but... But!

13:31.827 --> 13:40.112
You have until Saturday, December 21st at 6pm PT to submit yours, okay?

13:41.573 --> 13:45.195
That part is slow because it's very, very important, okay?

13:45.975 --> 13:46.275
Yeah.

13:46.355 --> 13:48.236
And Moco-chan, where can you find that?

13:48.276 --> 13:53.359
You can find the link right underneath us in... In my tag!

13:53.439 --> 13:53.959
Right...

13:55.800 --> 13:57.241
Right underneath us!

13:57.841 --> 13:59.901
In the description box, okay?

13:59.921 --> 14:01.362
There's a link there.

14:01.582 --> 14:01.902
Okay.

14:01.962 --> 14:03.182
And also on Twitter too, right?

14:03.222 --> 14:03.822
And Twitter, yeah.

14:03.842 --> 14:04.123
Yeah.

14:04.263 --> 14:07.303
So you better get writing, Ruffians!

14:07.483 --> 14:08.024
Go at it!

14:08.244 --> 14:12.625
Actually, maybe Ruffians, do you have any good ideas right now?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.746
Good ideas for memories to share, maybe?

14:16.806 --> 14:18.487
Maybe that will make some other Ruffians... Oh!

14:18.547 --> 14:19.187
Where was that?

14:19.247 --> 14:21.947
Don't share other Ruffians' memories.

14:22.007 --> 14:23.448
Not really, ha!

14:26.092 --> 14:26.693
You do?

14:27.173 --> 14:28.775
Oh, you're gonna keep it a secret, though?

14:29.736 --> 14:30.897
You have to turn your ears down.

14:31.378 --> 14:32.299
That's okay, that's okay.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.761
Nice to meet you.

14:33.781 --> 14:35.383
Oh no, spoilers!

14:35.463 --> 14:36.344
Are you secret?

14:38.299 --> 14:41.621
I'm not sure they're interesting enough though.

14:42.001 --> 14:45.003
I'm sure your memories are interesting, okay?

14:45.203 --> 14:46.284
I'm sure they are.

14:47.004 --> 14:48.425
Who got a dog for Christmas?

14:49.206 --> 14:52.828
Like, you got a new family member?

14:54.229 --> 14:57.451
One of my favorites is drinking hot chocolate with my kitty!

14:59.893 --> 15:03.296
We wanna hear those memories, okay?

15:03.777 --> 15:06.880
Please submit them, okay Ruffians?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.201
Those are all great.

15:08.782 --> 15:14.667
We're looking forward to the cozy time hearing all about those memories and moments, okay?

15:14.708 --> 15:15.288
BAU BAU!

15:18.611 --> 15:30.683
Well, you know, almost as soon as it becomes the new year, there is the big hololive New Year Card!

15:30.743 --> 15:34.726
The big Mario Card Tournament!

15:35.307 --> 15:35.727
You know what?

15:35.747 --> 15:39.829
This year, it'll be taking place on the 7th and the 8th!

15:39.909 --> 15:40.349
Yeah!

15:40.469 --> 15:45.171
And you know, us, FUWAMOCO, will be participating in it for the first time, of course!

15:45.231 --> 15:45.452
Yeah.

15:46.792 --> 15:51.014
And unlike the Minecraft Sports Day Tournament back in November, if you remember.

15:51.094 --> 15:51.934
I remember.

15:52.695 --> 15:55.476
This time, we're participating separately!

15:55.556 --> 16:00.058
And you know, we're separated into separate teams, because that's what happens when you participate separately.

16:00.078 --> 16:00.558
Yeah.

16:00.618 --> 16:01.159
Moco-chan, Abyss,

16:02.379 --> 16:07.621
I was gonna ask if we could share what groups we were put into, but... It's BAU.

16:08.881 --> 16:10.162
Wow, Ruffians!

16:10.382 --> 16:12.583
Moco-chan is in the Able!

16:12.763 --> 16:16.044
And myself, Fuwawa, I'm in the D.Va!

16:17.105 --> 16:19.105
What do you think of the team's hall, Ruffians?

16:19.485 --> 16:21.526
Good placement.

16:22.146 --> 16:23.307
Is it suited for us?

16:24.207 --> 16:25.748
Do you think we have a chance to win?

16:27.182 --> 16:28.362
D-D is scary.

16:28.602 --> 16:32.644
Fuwawa, D, Mococo, A, that is the block placement.

16:32.664 --> 16:32.904
Yeah.

16:33.404 --> 16:34.444
Sorted by random.

16:35.085 --> 16:35.705
Random.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.205
Yeah.

16:36.285 --> 16:38.486
Towa-senpai is random.

16:38.686 --> 16:41.066
Okai-senpai on the wheel.

16:41.106 --> 16:45.068
Sorted by Okai-senpai and Towa-senpai randomly.

16:45.528 --> 16:47.148
Yeah.

16:47.789 --> 16:48.529
Just what?

16:48.769 --> 16:50.049
Just like what?

16:50.109 --> 16:50.629
What's that?

16:51.270 --> 16:51.930
What's that?

16:52.050 --> 16:53.270
D group is chaotic.

16:54.371 --> 16:54.991
Hmm.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.280
Regardless, we're going to do our best.

17:00.420 --> 17:06.544
But we do have a lot of practicing to get through before so that we can catch up to our senpai.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.206
They've been many years, right?

17:09.626 --> 17:09.946
Yeah.

17:10.207 --> 17:11.908
You know, we'll do our best still.

17:12.268 --> 17:13.889
But one thing is for sure!

17:14.650 --> 17:17.712
Is that we're going to have the most fun!

17:17.772 --> 17:21.595
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

17:21.755 --> 17:22.475
That's for sure.

17:22.495 --> 17:23.816
I'm looking forward to it.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.017
It's going to be fun, okay?

17:25.137 --> 17:25.597
Yeah.

17:28.271 --> 17:39.256
Well, Ruffians, it's not just my yukkuri that's coming up, but you know, the end of the year is almost here.

17:39.276 --> 17:41.497
Do you know what that means?

17:41.517 --> 17:44.178
I'm curious.

17:44.939 --> 17:45.419
Do you know?

17:46.079 --> 17:49.181
There's something that FUWAMOCO is really excited about.

17:52.383 --> 17:55.066
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

17:55.206 --> 17:55.686
BAU BAU!

17:55.706 --> 17:58.989
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

18:09.486 --> 18:11.667
Well, maybe you should pay attention.

18:11.767 --> 18:12.627
That Ruffian!

18:12.907 --> 18:13.827
That Ruffian!

18:14.007 --> 18:16.148
Don't touch the morning air!

18:17.008 --> 18:18.248
I'm sorry Ruffian, I touched you.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.449
She's chasing the Ruffian with her finger.

18:20.509 --> 18:22.629
That Ruffian!

18:23.169 --> 18:24.269
Stop.

18:24.649 --> 18:25.950
At the end of the year.

18:26.290 --> 18:27.530
It's Winter Comic Market!

18:27.610 --> 18:30.451
And you know what?

18:30.491 --> 18:30.931
This year.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.629
Well, Moco-chan, what is comics?

18:34.889 --> 18:46.054
Okay, well, to explain first, so, in case you don't know, Comic Market is Japan's biggest fan comic convention where they sell doujinshi and other fan-made indie works, you know?

18:46.094 --> 18:47.415
So it's not just comics.

18:47.835 --> 18:55.138
It could be things like music or merchandise or even just, you know, written works about what kind of gyoza they like or their own homemade recipes.

18:55.198 --> 18:56.259
It could be anything, okay?

18:56.279 --> 18:59.040
And in the industry, there's also an industry, everyone.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.320
I guess they'll be official.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.201
Hold on!

19:01.901 --> 19:02.942
Yeah, it's super fun.

19:02.962 --> 19:05.102
Very free.

19:07.964 --> 19:09.905
You know, there's, of course, cosplay too.

19:09.925 --> 19:11.145
Lots of stuff going on.

19:11.165 --> 19:13.666
You really, really don't know what you might discover.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.207
Endless possibilities.

19:16.227 --> 19:17.768
We love Comiket.

19:17.808 --> 19:29.493
But, FUWAMOCO, us, Mococo, we're going to be making our Comiket debut at Icomochi-mama, so cool!

19:33.683 --> 19:34.644
Moco-chan, what's a circle?

19:35.745 --> 19:37.967
You know, a circle is like a... Circle's a shape.

19:38.587 --> 19:40.489
Yeah, it is a shape.

19:40.569 --> 19:44.712
But, you know, it's what you call a comic group.

19:45.412 --> 19:45.993
But yeah!

19:46.073 --> 19:47.074
Icomochi-mama!

19:47.314 --> 19:49.996
She's releasing an unofficial FUWAMOCO fanbook set!

19:50.196 --> 19:52.678
And we're really excited!

19:53.038 --> 19:54.839
You know, look at the cute blanket too.

19:56.946 --> 20:04.511
You know, we've also been seeing some other very creative Ruffians getting ready for their own FUWAMOCO related books and comic book day.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.192
So we can't wait!

20:07.653 --> 20:10.935
Creative Ruffians.

20:11.115 --> 20:13.816
You're gonna send us a copy too, right?

20:16.018 --> 20:16.358
Right.

20:17.099 --> 20:18.760
Right?

20:18.780 --> 20:18.980
Right!

20:19.340 --> 20:19.960
Of course, right!

20:21.856 --> 20:26.565
You know, like we said in our debut, we want to get our paws off FUWAMOCO!

20:26.605 --> 20:26.805
Yeah!

20:26.845 --> 20:29.009
We said that!

20:29.069 --> 20:29.790
Yeah, but...

20:38.015 --> 20:42.699
But you know, we're still looking forward to seeing all the Ruffian spoils of war done.

20:42.739 --> 20:43.340
Yeah!

20:43.360 --> 20:46.562
Because Comiket is mine!

20:46.843 --> 20:47.924
BAU BAU!

20:48.384 --> 20:49.345
BAU BAU!

20:49.385 --> 20:51.307
Have fun!

20:51.447 --> 20:52.688
Exciting!

20:52.728 --> 20:53.629
Very very exciting.

20:53.689 --> 20:54.990
Comiket is so fun.

20:56.969 --> 20:58.930
It's chaos, it's war, but it's fun.

20:59.031 --> 21:02.373
Very fun.

21:02.673 --> 21:06.556
You know it's also, it's not the end of the year, it's kind of close to the end of the year.

21:06.596 --> 21:07.917
It's the holiday season.

21:08.237 --> 21:13.260
So Ruffians, naturally, you've been eating a lot of chocolate recently.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.001
Naturally!

21:14.161 --> 21:14.421
Right?

21:15.102 --> 21:20.886
Not FUWAMOCO though, no chocolate for us, but... What about chocolate wafers?

21:21.486 --> 21:23.047
Have you been having any of those?

21:25.009 --> 21:25.269
No!

21:26.306 --> 21:32.152
Now, well, maybe it's time that you should.

21:32.712 --> 21:49.068
Because Ruffians, starting in April, you'll be able to find us, Advent, and a bunch of our senpai packed together as cards along almost any kind of candy place.

21:50.826 --> 21:54.489
Do you think you'll be able to find us?

21:54.569 --> 21:56.150
Yeah.

22:09.961 --> 22:11.382
FUWAMOCO is here!

22:11.402 --> 22:13.183
FUWAMOCO is here!

22:14.584 --> 22:16.265
Candy for FUWAMOCO!

22:16.545 --> 22:19.427
We're gonna be in accord with the candy.

22:19.447 --> 22:21.008
We won't become the candy.

22:21.068 --> 22:24.691
But we're really looking forward to it!

22:24.951 --> 22:27.032
Try your best to get FUWAMOCO, okay?

22:30.220 --> 22:34.582
You know, I... You might have to get a lot of wafers first, huh?

22:34.642 --> 22:36.363
Yeah, you might have to eat them.

22:36.403 --> 22:41.126
Yeah, but... I hope you like wafers!

22:41.426 --> 22:43.567
They're delicious!

22:43.907 --> 22:44.168
That's April.

22:44.588 --> 22:44.968
April.

22:45.428 --> 22:47.729
You still have some time to move to Japan!

22:47.749 --> 22:49.750
You still have time, okay?

22:49.771 --> 22:50.511
Yeah, you know... April.

22:51.529 --> 22:52.470
Ohikoshi wa mada.

22:52.710 --> 22:54.131
Ari desu.

22:54.551 --> 22:57.573
BAU BAU!

22:57.593 --> 23:00.515
Oh, I'm excited for those.

23:00.935 --> 23:01.616
Chocolate.

23:02.936 --> 23:09.461
But we don't know what flavor it's gonna be though, so... There's so many possibilities.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.582
I bet it, Ruffians, it's gonna be your favorite flavor.

23:12.623 --> 23:13.043
For sure.

23:13.063 --> 23:16.245
For sure.

23:16.945 --> 23:18.146
Exciting.

23:25.549 --> 23:27.310
It's been exciting.

23:27.370 --> 23:37.337
It's been good, but... Ruffians... I kinda did... I did something.

23:37.757 --> 23:38.257
I did it.

23:38.518 --> 23:38.958
He did.

23:40.039 --> 23:42.941
I messed up.

23:43.601 --> 23:47.904
There's been... Another misunderstanding.

23:49.645 --> 23:50.746
There goes our combo.

23:55.162 --> 24:03.031
Do you ever say something that's, like, wrong, but you think, well, everyone understands, so it's fine, right?

24:03.211 --> 24:06.094
And then you continue to say that all the time?

24:06.114 --> 24:09.097
That happens to us a lot.

24:09.738 --> 24:10.699
Yeah, just a bit.

24:10.819 --> 24:11.600
Yeah, well...

24:12.279 --> 24:23.674
Ah, that's why, you know, I described our sneezes as having different flavors the other day while we were reading Super Chats after playing Chillin's Art.

24:24.094 --> 24:24.916
Snooze game!

24:25.116 --> 24:25.937
Jishatsu!

24:26.558 --> 24:27.138
You know, because...

24:27.759 --> 24:28.359
Ichibou.

24:28.459 --> 24:31.221
Sneezes have different flavors to them.

24:31.601 --> 24:34.663
Yeah, like personality, you know, personality.

24:34.703 --> 24:35.644
Personality.

24:35.664 --> 24:37.785
Not like an actual taste.

24:38.065 --> 24:38.265
No.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.186
No, of course, of course not.

24:40.506 --> 24:41.987
That's gross, Ruffians.

24:42.047 --> 24:42.728
Very, very gross.

24:42.828 --> 24:45.689
Yeah, and it's not like you can taste the flavor when you sneeze.

24:46.010 --> 24:46.570
I'm hot.

24:47.290 --> 24:47.751
Right, Moco-chan?

24:47.771 --> 24:50.112
I don't know.

24:50.732 --> 24:52.573
I feel like I can smell more.

24:52.593 --> 24:54.194
Uwabi sneeze.

24:54.855 --> 24:54.995
What?

24:55.015 --> 24:55.255
Uwabi.

25:01.427 --> 25:04.589
I mean, I feel like after sneezing I can smell more.

25:04.609 --> 25:07.231
I don't know if that counts though.

25:07.811 --> 25:08.672
That doesn't count, no.

25:10.453 --> 25:12.395
Ruffians, you understand me, right?

25:12.415 --> 25:15.297
There's a personality in every sneeze.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.098
That makes sense, right?

25:17.118 --> 25:18.039
Not flavor, though.

25:18.259 --> 25:18.940
Just personality.

25:18.980 --> 25:22.102
Each of our sneezes have a different personality to them.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.364
Yeah, like a spicy sneeze.

25:24.644 --> 25:26.726
But that's a flavor, though.

25:28.427 --> 25:31.129
I'm just confusing the Ruffians more, aren't I?

25:31.790 --> 25:33.471
Ruffians, you understand, right?

25:33.491 --> 25:36.593
We're trying to clear up the misunderstanding, not make more.

25:36.613 --> 25:38.655
You understand, right?

25:39.175 --> 25:39.776
Understood?

25:41.354 --> 25:42.014
Understood.

25:44.435 --> 25:45.396
Do they understand?

25:45.416 --> 25:49.378
Just smile and say understood.

25:50.538 --> 25:51.719
Understood!

25:52.339 --> 25:54.440
BAU BAU!

25:54.460 --> 25:57.481
I'm glad the Ruffians are so understanding.

25:57.802 --> 25:59.522
Right?

25:59.542 --> 26:01.063
Me too.

26:01.983 --> 26:03.204
Wow, Ruffians.

26:03.584 --> 26:06.245
How are you feeling about this week so far?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.087
Has it been a little rough maybe?

26:10.589 --> 26:11.309
How's it?

26:13.330 --> 26:14.851
I wouldn't know anything about that.

26:16.311 --> 26:18.032
No, not at all, huh?

26:18.712 --> 26:19.112
Uh-uh.

26:20.053 --> 26:26.135
Well, Moco-chan, maybe the Ruffians could use a little extra popping and stuff.

26:27.535 --> 26:33.497
Well... Ruffians!

26:35.278 --> 26:37.239
Can you get a bit closer?

26:39.568 --> 26:42.550
You know, there's something I wanna say!

26:43.231 --> 26:44.372
You know what this is, right?

26:45.413 --> 26:48.055
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

26:48.555 --> 26:52.018
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

26:52.679 --> 26:53.399
Ruffians!

26:54.060 --> 26:58.704
You know, sometimes it can be rough, right?

26:59.798 --> 27:03.340
No matter how hard you try, things just don't go your way.

27:03.980 --> 27:04.280
You know?

27:04.940 --> 27:09.222
No matter how much you prepare, your plans get a wrench thrown in them.

27:10.683 --> 27:18.246
Sometimes, you really can't prepare and expect what's gonna happen the next day no matter how hard you try to be ready for the unexpected.

27:19.006 --> 27:20.887
And you know, that's okay!

27:21.428 --> 27:23.608
Because that's just how life is!

27:25.089 --> 27:26.710
But, you know what?

27:28.137 --> 27:30.359
You have a secret trick to you!

27:30.999 --> 27:32.140
You're resilient!

27:32.780 --> 27:34.381
You're super strong!

27:34.942 --> 27:40.466
Despite how you feel sometimes, when things get rough, you actually get tougher!

27:41.266 --> 27:42.847
Don't you think that's amazing?

27:43.768 --> 27:52.194
So, no matter how difficult and frustrating things can be at this busy time of year, don't worry, don't sweat the small stuff, and you know what?

27:53.455 --> 27:54.155
You'll be okay.

27:55.136 --> 27:57.798
Even if you don't have everything under control,

27:58.496 --> 28:00.518
You do have some things under control.

28:01.578 --> 28:02.379
And that's good enough.

28:02.679 --> 28:03.140
Okay!

28:03.160 --> 28:10.025
You know, it sounds kind of silly, but let's enjoy the punches that life sends our way to, okay?

28:10.685 --> 28:12.126
You can do it, Ruffians!

28:12.687 --> 28:13.948
You can do it!

28:14.428 --> 28:16.069
Ganbaite ne!

28:16.169 --> 28:18.111
BAU BAU!

28:18.971 --> 28:21.573
BAU BAU!

28:23.114 --> 28:24.976
You can do it, Ruffians!

28:28.916 --> 28:30.097
BAU BAU!

28:30.598 --> 28:31.439
And next!

28:32.059 --> 28:35.242
We're gonna have a Doggie of the Day!

28:35.262 --> 28:37.644
Moco-chan, who's the Doggie of the Day today?

28:37.964 --> 28:40.666
We have... De-den!

28:40.766 --> 28:42.528
We have Kobe!

28:42.588 --> 28:45.811
Kobe is the Doggie of the Day!

28:46.952 --> 28:48.393
This isn't this Ruffian's dog.

28:50.635 --> 28:53.057
No, this is this Ruffian's friend's dog.

28:55.114 --> 28:55.414
Yeah!

28:55.535 --> 28:57.877
I guess that's acceptable, but... What do you mean?

28:58.057 --> 29:01.520
He didn't say your Doggie of the Day, just our Doggie of the Day.

29:02.201 --> 29:09.068
You know, Kobe is extra special because apparently he's a model for a vulgar... or dog?

29:09.568 --> 29:09.968
Dog?

29:10.509 --> 29:10.889
Yeah.

29:11.690 --> 29:12.951
Are you sure about that?

29:13.936 --> 29:16.637
You know, he kinda looks like he's made of cardboard.

29:17.798 --> 29:18.978
Cardboard?

29:19.438 --> 29:24.281
Well, you know, it's good to have lots of different doggies of all kinds, you know?

29:24.601 --> 29:25.781
Especially cardboard ones.

29:26.201 --> 29:28.182
Yeah, it adds flavor!

29:28.302 --> 29:29.003
Flavor?

29:29.443 --> 29:31.464
Not personality?

29:31.584 --> 29:32.224
Flavor!

29:33.144 --> 29:36.246
Very cute.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.107
How does Kobe BAU BAU?

29:38.387 --> 29:41.608
You know Kobe works for a dog store?

29:42.889 --> 29:43.329
Maybe like...

29:44.414 --> 29:45.556
Like that!

29:45.596 --> 29:46.077
Like that!

29:57.526 --> 30:00.627
I don't know what this BAU BAU is, but sure, it can be Kobe's.

30:03.008 --> 30:03.328
Kobe!

30:04.048 --> 30:07.009
Kobe is ambitious.

30:07.389 --> 30:11.290
He will show that he's cut out for the modeling industry.

30:11.390 --> 30:12.611
Cut out of cardboard.

30:14.371 --> 30:15.712
He's so cut out for it.

30:16.192 --> 30:18.353
He even looks a little bit like a cutout.

30:18.513 --> 30:19.134
Why?

30:19.394 --> 30:20.474
Yeah, and you know what?

30:20.975 --> 30:23.676
He's doing an amazing job.

30:24.516 --> 30:26.958
BAU BAU!

30:27.518 --> 30:28.658
Very cute cardboard.

30:28.839 --> 30:29.919
Good boy.

30:30.059 --> 30:31.740
Right?

30:31.880 --> 30:32.781
Good boy.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.181
BAU BAU!

30:34.542 --> 30:39.984
And next for today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

30:41.665 --> 30:42.646
What?

30:42.846 --> 30:43.927
Oh my goodness!

30:44.648 --> 30:45.689
This is beautiful!

30:45.769 --> 30:47.310
It's so colorful!

30:47.510 --> 30:49.331
This is downtown Mexico City!

30:49.352 --> 30:52.854
Did you buy anything there?

30:52.874 --> 31:08.067
You know, I don't know, it might be a bit silly, but you know, I actually really love looking at the lights at night, you know, so this illumination, I really like it a lot.

31:10.310 --> 31:12.914
It looks like it was a lot of fun!

31:13.896 --> 31:15.999
Thank you for sharing it with us!

31:16.039 --> 31:17.642
BAU BAU!

31:18.764 --> 31:22.007
Ah, next time we got a question from a Ruffian.

31:22.047 --> 31:25.369
My question of the day is... De-den!

31:25.710 --> 31:26.830
Good morning!

31:26.931 --> 31:28.111
Good morning!

31:28.131 --> 31:30.353
I'm always looking forward for the pup talk.

31:30.593 --> 31:34.076
It gives me real power for an entire week.

31:34.296 --> 31:35.597
I have a question.

31:35.697 --> 31:39.340
Has FUWAMOCO's hair always had this length ratio?

31:39.360 --> 31:42.583
Or has Mococo had it longer than Fuwawa's at some point?

31:43.043 --> 31:43.744
BAU BAU!

31:44.084 --> 31:45.225
BAU BAU!

31:45.585 --> 31:46.626
This is another good question.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.067
It's a good question.

31:48.487 --> 31:55.391
Well, actually, at one point, when we were really little demon dogs, it was me.

31:56.271 --> 31:57.232
I had long hair.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.854
And I had short hair.

32:01.174 --> 32:02.394
So it is strange, right?

32:02.815 --> 32:04.536
Are you surprised, Ruffians?

32:05.036 --> 32:08.318
But, you know, we much, much prefer it like this.

32:08.538 --> 32:09.978
It works best like this, right?

32:10.059 --> 32:13.981
We're the cutest now, just as we are right, Ruffians?

32:16.437 --> 32:16.958
Right!

32:18.340 --> 32:19.582
What's with the sock, Emily?

32:19.622 --> 32:20.083
Huh?

32:21.144 --> 32:21.785
Huh?

32:23.588 --> 32:23.808
Yes!

32:23.928 --> 32:24.029
Yes!

32:26.540 --> 32:27.340
Yeah!

32:27.520 --> 32:28.480
Right answer.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.661
BAU BAU!

32:31.761 --> 32:39.263
Thank you so much for all your submissions and for being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning along with us, Ruffians!

32:39.723 --> 32:40.343
Thank you!

32:40.503 --> 32:43.064
We're always looking for more Doggie of the Day!

32:43.264 --> 32:45.044
For questions, questions, questions, questions.

32:45.104 --> 32:47.144
I'm sure you have lots of questions.

32:47.385 --> 32:49.025
For more walks, you know.

32:49.345 --> 32:54.186
And especially the brand new FUWAMOCO scoop as well under the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

32:55.288 --> 32:58.072
Thank you so much for always supporting us, Ruffians!

32:58.112 --> 32:58.633
BAU BAU!

33:00.936 --> 33:02.418
And next!

33:02.478 --> 33:06.381
Well, what we have upcoming next isn't a stream, but!

33:06.962 --> 33:07.262
But!

33:08.263 --> 33:09.444
We have!

33:09.725 --> 33:18.453
Tonight at 6pm PT 11am JST, we're gonna be premiering our solo covers of Kyuuto no Kano-chan!

33:18.493 --> 33:20.175
Today and tomorrow!

33:20.255 --> 33:22.897
You know, so today is me, tomorrow is Moco-chan.

33:23.138 --> 33:23.838
And then!

33:24.859 --> 33:31.446
On Friday we'll be back bright and early with you for FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:31.506 --> 33:35.491
It'll be a little bit of a wait, but we'll see you again soon, okay?

33:35.511 --> 33:36.672
We'll be around, okay?

33:36.992 --> 33:37.853
We will.

33:38.193 --> 33:40.095
BAU BAU!

33:40.316 --> 33:42.918
And if we take another peek at our schedule...

33:46.149 --> 33:47.430
Busy Ruffians.

33:47.871 --> 33:51.093
Well you know, Christmas is just about here.

33:51.473 --> 33:55.096
And this weekend we have a lot of plans on Saturday.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.899
Moco Santa's coming to town.

33:58.279 --> 34:02.082
At FUWAMOCO we're gonna be going to Malaysia for Carnival Fiesta.

34:02.362 --> 34:06.846
And then we're gonna be playing Among Us together with Alphard and our Ian-senpai.

34:07.206 --> 34:10.109
And then, Sunday is Christmas Eve.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.271
And we have some big plans with you!

34:13.251 --> 34:16.354
So, we hope that you'll be able to spend a little bit of time with us.

34:16.394 --> 34:17.254
Don't miss it, okay?

34:17.274 --> 34:18.776
Even if it's just a little bit.

34:19.216 --> 34:19.676
Okay.

34:20.137 --> 34:21.318
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:21.458 --> 34:22.018

34:29.064 --> 34:31.726
And thank you for also being so understanding.

34:32.006 --> 34:35.409
We had to make a couple of changes to our schedule yesterday.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.831
We really appreciate it.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.472
Moco-chan.

34:39.673 --> 34:41.154
I'm feeling a little bit better.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.571
It's because of you, Ruffians.

34:43.591 --> 34:44.071
Thank you.

34:44.111 --> 34:44.972
Thank you.

34:44.992 --> 34:52.616
