00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:00.901
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:05.309
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:09.382
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.869
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:15.707
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.294
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.296
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:26.879
And today, we're your hosts
of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.560
Thank you for joining us!

00:05:32.017 --> 00:05:33.500
Have you enjoyed
the past two days...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.040
of Advent debuts?

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.733
It's been a busy two days for
hololive English -Advent-members

00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:47.554
like us, and Biboo, and
Shiori, and Nerissa, but...

00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:49.928
Did you enjoy them?
Did you watch them?

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:55.428
Did you enjoy the two
days of Advent debuts?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.821
- How was it?
- How was it?

00:05:58.121 --> 00:05:59.128
How's it been?

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:00.943
We hope you enjoyed them!

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.885
Did you find a new oshi, maybe?

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.967
It's always good
to get new favorites.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.284
Well...

00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:15.637
Today is a very
special day because

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.376
this is the pilot episode
of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:23.138
Does it seem kind of mysterious?

00:06:23.318 --> 00:06:24.939
Is it mysterious?

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:32.087
Well, maybe a happy mysterious, but... Yes.
FUWAMOCO Morning is not that mysterious.

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:38.307
It's our special live program held
every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:38.447 --> 00:06:39.668
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:43.150
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.751
Surprise!

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.252
It's a short format
morning show.

00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:49.814
I guess it might be
a late night show.

00:06:50.274 --> 00:06:52.255
Which one is it for
you? What time is it?

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.897
Is it a morning show?
Is it a late night show?

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.714
- Or is it a...
- Should we change the name?

00:06:57.536 --> 00:06:58.536
Yeah, which one?

00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:01.077
Morning?

00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:03.256
- Morning?
- Afternoon?

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.283
Late night, late night.

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:06.844
FUWAMOCO Morning in your heart.

00:07:07.381 --> 00:07:12.927
But if it's like "FUWAMOCO Night
Time", that's a different kind of show, no?

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:15.874
FUWAMOCO in your heart.

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:19.316
Morning in your heart, but
also FUWAMOCO in your heart.

00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:26.409
FUWAMOCO Morning,
what we aim to do is we aim to

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.043
bring a smile to your face and help
you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:32.444 --> 00:07:35.134
You might have noticed
with our schedule, but y'know

00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:37.847
We're really hoping to start
our day together with you.

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:40.029
And together.

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.290
You know, playing fun games
and doing other different things.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.687
And that way we can all have a really
happy, healthy life routine all together.

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:49.993
Yeah, it's important.

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:52.915
We need you Ruffians
in good shape, okay?

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.036
You gotta stay tip-top healthy.

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:58.317
You have to be the
hot dog of every day.

00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:00.531
Right?

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:01.564
Is that okay?

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:04.503
You're good with
being healthy, right?

00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:09.365
Well, maybe it might happen
whether you like it or not.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:15.547
Anyways, we'd be really honored if
you could spend time with us like this.

00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:17.227
- And Japanese too!
- Yeah, you're right!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.247
Before we forget!

00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:19.528
FUWAMOCO Morning is...

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:29.773
FUWAMOCO Morning is a
regular morning variety show.

00:08:29.807 --> 00:08:30.807
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.446
I know it's a bit late for
everyone in Japan, but

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:44.783
This show's goal is to
help you start your day off

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.940
With a smile.

00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:12.825
- That's the goal!
- Healthy!

00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:16.200
But yeah, today's
just the pilot episode.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.204
But we really hope that
FUWAMOCO Morning can be

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:22.976
A really warm, cozy show
that we can all enjoy together.

00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:27.308
Maybe as you roll out of bed,
or maybe on your way to work?

00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:30.673
Or you're like "ahh,
today's no good, <i>dame da</i>."

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:35.536
Then maybe we can put on FUWAMOCO Morning
and be like "okay, I'll get out of bed."

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:37.957
That would make us really happy.

00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:41.940
But yeah, since
today's the pilot episode,

00:09:42.827 --> 00:09:43.827
It's a bit different.

00:09:43.864 --> 00:09:45.740
It's a bit different.
It's episode 0, right?

00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:46.765
Episode 0.

00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:51.967
Pilot episodes never really end
up to be, like, the actual show, right?

00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:55.149
- Well, we'll all have to find out!
- Yeah, right?

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.669
It's gonna be a journey.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.010
- What does FUWAMOCO Morning become?
- Right?

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.011
- It's still a mystery to us, too.
- Yeah.

00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:02.692
I think it's good like that.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:04.232 --> 00:10:07.874
But, first and foremost,
we have one thing.

00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:11.375
We wanted to say...

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:14.460
Big, big thank you!

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.000
De-den!

00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:22.603
We've reached 300,000 Ruffians!

00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:24.784
Can you believe it?

00:10:27.445 --> 00:10:33.618
We've reached 300,000 Ruffians! It's all
thanks to everyone! Thank you very much!

00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:35.346
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:39.650
I don't really,
like, understand.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.492
We're absolutely blown away.

00:10:45.592 --> 00:10:49.934
It's actually kind
of dizzying for me.

00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:00.453
Thank you very much!

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.669
Thank you so much
for all your support!

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.105
And of course we're really
thankful to our senpai's hard work

00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:10.287
Building up hololive to make it
the amazing place that it is today.

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:14.309
Even though today
is... Does it still count?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.794
It's our first day as brand new
members of hololive English.

00:11:18.514 --> 00:11:20.600
We would really like to
do the same, you know.

00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:23.571
To make hololive an even
more amazing and even

00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:26.372
more warm place for
our future kouhai, too.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.020
Isn't it a bit early
to be thinking that?

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:34.802
It's a little bit early, but... It's
important, you know? It's important, so...

00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:41.427
It'd make us really happy if you continue to
let everyone know about all of us at Advent.

00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:44.870
And if you could continue to spread
your love of hololive everywhere you go.

00:11:46.737 --> 00:11:50.440
Maybe even FUWAMOCO
could be included in that too, huh?

00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:52.929
Is that okay?

00:11:53.528 --> 00:11:55.431
- Thank you for all the congrats!
- You know?

00:11:55.461 --> 00:12:01.508
I saw on Twitter some Ruffians
already have an oshi mark.

00:12:01.568 --> 00:12:04.770
Yeah, I saw it
too! I saw it too!

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.792
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you!

00:12:06.812 --> 00:12:08.693
We're very happy
puppies right now.

00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:14.197
Once Twitter starts to be nice to us
again, we'll be able to look at more stuff.

00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:18.241
So it's been a bit difficult for us,
but we want to see lots of stuff.

00:12:20.196 --> 00:12:26.766
I noticed I made a spelling, a silly
typo, in actually a couple tweets.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:31.375
And I wanted to retweet it,
but then I got embarrassed.

00:12:31.763 --> 00:12:35.170
I haven't really been
able to look at the tweet.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.530
Did you notice it?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.851
You didn't notice, right?

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.224
Please don't notice.

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:40.981
Please don't notice, okay?

00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:46.391
You know, I even asked Fuwawa to
copy what she was gonna post, but

00:12:46.744 --> 00:12:48.514
Moco-chan looked at it
and she said it was okay.

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.357
I was sleepy.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:54.126
You didn't notice, okay.

00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:55.404
I'll do better.

00:12:55.429 --> 00:12:58.589
But you know, deleting
tweets? That's no good.

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:01.551
You can't delete it.

00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:02.652
Even if you have a typo.

00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:13.346
What? We're gonna make another big
mistake and then delete our tweets today.

00:13:14.322 --> 00:13:15.322
Just because we said it.

00:13:17.203 --> 00:13:19.764
Please. Twitter, be nice to us.

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:21.325
My fingers... Which typo?

00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:22.606
No, don't look, okay?

00:13:22.646 --> 00:13:24.352
Don't look, don't
look, don't look.

00:13:24.377 --> 00:13:28.061
Now they're gonna be watching
our tweets and be like "Ooh..."

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:29.432
We just...

00:13:29.457 --> 00:13:31.888
- No more typos, okay, Moco-chan?
- We did it to ourselves.

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:38.096
Well, the next thing... You might have
noticed we had a bit of a surprise for you.

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:41.159
De-den!

00:13:41.511 --> 00:13:43.130
Kaibutsu!

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.543
Did you hear it?

00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:45.691
Did you watch it?

00:13:45.716 --> 00:13:47.105
Our first cover song.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:48.568
You didn't miss it, right?

00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:51.615
It was released at the very end.

00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:53.239
We kind of forgot!

00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:57.316
Yeah. Kaibutsu by YOASOBI-san.

00:13:57.538 --> 00:14:00.120
Yeah, we covered
Kaibutsu by YOASOBI-san.

00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:01.262
Moco-chan just said that.

00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:05.944
- But, it's... It's...
- Really happy.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:07.879
What did you think
of it? "It's really good"?

00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:10.516
- You like it?
- Thank you for listening to it!

00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:16.718
"Cover is fire!" Thank you!

00:14:20.354 --> 00:14:25.857
It made us really happy because, you know,
it's our first cover song with FUWAMOCO.

00:14:26.222 --> 00:14:31.281
And, you know, we actually, we don't
really have that much experience recording.

00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:34.059
- We just like to howl.
- We just howl.

00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:35.568
And that's it.

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:38.867
Yeah. You don't record the
howling, you just howl, right?

00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:40.538
You just howl and
then you're done.

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:45.272
So, it's really special to
us to have a recording that

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:48.389
not only we can listen,
but you can listen to too.

00:14:48.414 --> 00:14:50.190
And, you know, Kaibutsu.

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:53.112
We chose it for a
very special reason.

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:55.033
Moco-chan, do you
want to talk about it more?

00:14:55.088 --> 00:15:00.121
Well, I feel like recently I've
had lots of just like, lightning.

00:15:00.276 --> 00:15:02.757
- <i>Hirameki</i>?
- <i>Hirameki</i>, like, it just strikes me.

00:15:04.858 --> 00:15:06.060
That's what Kaibutsu was.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.155
It was like "<i>yoshi yaro</i>"!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.367
I'm gonna do it! Kaibutsu!

00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:13.771
At first I was
like "Aah, uhm..."

00:15:14.412 --> 00:15:16.313
But then after
reading the lyrics,

00:15:17.368 --> 00:15:20.799
It really really resonated
within us, you know?

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:25.101
The meaning of the lyrics for
songs is always really important to us

00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:27.466
So we'd like you to
check them out if you can.

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:33.310
The reason why we covered
Kaibutsu this time was

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:39.061
Because the lyrics really
resonated with our hearts. Right?

00:15:39.987 --> 00:15:42.546
That's the reason we did it.

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:45.525
We sang that.

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:49.577
- It was a new challenge.
- Yeah, it was.

00:15:49.602 --> 00:15:53.362
- It was a new challenge recording Kaibutsu.
- Yeah, there's so many harmonies.

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:58.318
Right? Usually when we howl
together it's just like "BAU BAU!"

00:15:58.343 --> 00:16:00.874
And maybe like a
little bit "BAU BAU!"

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:02.380
Moco-chan, you'd do the BAU BAU.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.610
Right?

00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:05.671
- That's accurate.
- Right?

00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:08.197
We're a bit nervous, but...

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:15.589
Hamahiro-san did such a
good job with the mix magic.

00:16:15.877 --> 00:16:18.903
And Hae-san
with the illustration.

00:16:18.928 --> 00:16:21.598
Omika-san, beautiful video!

00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:23.374
You checked it out, right?

00:16:23.677 --> 00:16:27.300
Did you notice all the little
things? All the cool things?

00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:28.813
Go find them.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:33.380
If you watched it once, maybe it's time to
go watch it twice after FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:16:34.644 --> 00:16:35.644
Right?

00:16:36.105 --> 00:16:39.370
But it was a really,
really fun experience.

00:16:39.462 --> 00:16:41.431
We're looking forward
to hopefully doing more.

00:16:43.696 --> 00:16:46.293
We know we talked about the
lyrics being really important to us.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.871
But maybe if you don't
understand Japanese,

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:51.795
it might be difficult to
understand the meaning,

00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:57.585
And that's why we did an English
translation ourselves: FUWAMOCO!

00:16:57.645 --> 00:16:59.386
FUWAMOCO did
the English translation.

00:16:59.406 --> 00:17:01.768
- It's not quite ready yet, though.
- Not quite yet.

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:04.473
So we're hoping that it'll be up
soon, but we'll let you know, okay?

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.111
Please look forward to it!

00:17:06.136 --> 00:17:08.853
But still watch it now, and then you
can watch it once they're done, okay?

00:17:08.878 --> 00:17:10.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:10.854 --> 00:17:12.195
You can turn off all the lights,

00:17:12.608 --> 00:17:15.316
Make it fullscreen and watch
it like you're in a movie theater.

00:17:15.336 --> 00:17:16.511
Really loud, right?

00:17:17.476 --> 00:17:18.667
Make the neighbors angry.

00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:21.057
That's the recommendation.

00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:22.857
Please watch it, okay?

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:29.650
As for one thing... I thought
maybe we should address...

00:17:31.048 --> 00:17:33.619
- It's still our first day, but...
- This.

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:38.215
There's a misunderstanding!
Did you know?

00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:39.757
- bau bau bau...
- This.

00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:44.507
Apparently...

00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:49.547
There's a rumor. A
misunderstanding.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.846
I was framed!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.814
I was framed.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.394
During the collab.

00:18:05.391 --> 00:18:11.045
Both Calli-senpai and A-chan thought
that Fuwawa said something that was wrong.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.898
No! I didn't say anything bad!

00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:18.319
I'm not the first Advent
member to say a bad word!

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.541
No, no, no, no.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.479
Ruffians, you're not thinking
that I really said that, right?

00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:30.121
You know I'm not that
kind of person, right?

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200
We aren't.

00:18:31.674 --> 00:18:34.385
Us and Biboo are
not that type of person.

00:18:34.976 --> 00:18:38.808
I don't know about Nerissa and
Shiori, but... Not us and Biboo.

00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:44.936
You know, it happened when I
was explaining, you know, how...

00:18:45.476 --> 00:18:47.838
We got into The
Cell and everything.

00:18:48.498 --> 00:18:51.140
And I said "we got locked up!"

00:18:52.301 --> 00:18:55.083
But they thought
it was "fluffed up."

00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:59.546
Moco-chan, you're gonna
say it straight like that?

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.687
But a bit different than that.

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:03.288
A bit different than that!

00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:12.271
I think A-chan and Calli-senpai, maybe
they need to get their ears adjusted.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.351
Their minds out of the gutter.

00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:16.817
Ruffians, you too!

00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:18.398
You too if you thought that.

00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:21.020
You have to believe us, okay?

00:19:21.382 --> 00:19:22.942
"I believe them." Thank you!

00:19:24.142 --> 00:19:26.864
Thank you for believing.

00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:27.884
You understand that?

00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:32.163
I am not the first member
of Advent to say anything.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.907
And I will never be the last...

00:19:37.132 --> 00:19:38.132
The last member to say...

00:19:38.336 --> 00:19:41.138
I will never be a member that
says something bad like that.

00:19:42.127 --> 00:19:44.251
- Got it? Understood?
- Nerissa and Shiori? I'm not too sure.

00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:53.190
Now that we all
understand that... De-den!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.190
We wanted to talk
about the debut goods!

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:57.817
The debut goods!

00:19:57.842 --> 00:19:58.931
Have you checked them out?

00:19:59.173 --> 00:20:01.285
OK, OK. I know maybe we're like:

00:20:01.322 --> 00:20:05.615
"Of course FUWAMOCO would want
to talk about the debut goods," right?

00:20:06.533 --> 00:20:08.842
Somebody probably told them.

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:10.773
- Not that.
- No.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:12.815
We're really excited.

00:20:12.835 --> 00:20:14.816
Do you understand
how amazing this is?

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:16.981
Do you understand?

00:20:18.487 --> 00:20:22.358
- You already bought them! Ooh! Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:20:24.385 --> 00:20:28.155
Well, the reason why we
wanted to talk about them is...

00:20:28.448 --> 00:20:32.155
You know, for FUWAMOCO,
this is really big.

00:20:32.195 --> 00:20:33.316
This is really exciting!

00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:35.846
I think for a lot of people,
they sort of think that like,

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.380
Goods are given and it's
just gonna happen, right?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.462
- But it's not!
- No, it's not!

00:20:40.894 --> 00:20:42.855
So, we're really,
really excited.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880
We hope you are too.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.578
We hope you check
them out, you know.

00:20:45.858 --> 00:20:49.823
There's the acrylic
stands, the acrylic panels.

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:51.725
There's acrylic laminates.

00:20:52.045 --> 00:20:53.467
I am really excited about those.

00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:54.608
There's the stained glass.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:57.732
The strap! The
stained glass strap!

00:20:57.972 --> 00:20:59.714
And of course the voices.

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:02.457
The voice too. Yes,
the pre-escape voices.

00:21:02.877 --> 00:21:05.478
Really, really fun to
be able to record it.

00:21:05.678 --> 00:21:07.678
- Ah, we forgot Japanese.
- We did forget!

00:21:08.882 --> 00:21:13.040
Everyone in Japan: did you guys
check out our Advent merch?

00:21:13.082 --> 00:21:16.501
- Our debut merch is on sale, y'know?
- It's on sale!

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.850
I can't stop getting excited.

00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:22.699
Y'know, FUWAMOCO...

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.948
The reason we wanted to
talk about our merch today

00:21:26.972 --> 00:21:30.940
is because we think
it's really important to us.

00:21:30.953 --> 00:21:31.173
Wow!

00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:33.028
- "Wow," isn't it?
- "Wow" indeed!

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:37.879
And because merch is
not a given, of course,

00:21:38.294 --> 00:21:41.839
We're really happy.

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.283
We'd be glad if you
could check it out.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.093
Please check it out, OK?

00:21:51.373 --> 00:21:54.255
Yeah, we didn't know.

00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:58.631
We haven't decided how many goods,
how many merch sets

00:21:58.656 --> 00:22:00.578
- we're supposed to buy.
- 'Cause you're supposed to buy 3.

00:22:00.603 --> 00:22:03.739
Three?! That's the
otaku rule, right?

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.440
I can't remember, I
just remember three.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.221
One to, like, love?

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:09.917
One for saving.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:11.670
And what was the other one?

00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:16.528
To love again when the
other one gets loved up?

00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:18.086
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.473
But it's okay, you can
buy more than three too.

00:22:23.873 --> 00:22:24.873
An army.

00:22:24.898 --> 00:22:27.761
- An army of FUWAMOCO!
- Y'know? That is fun though.

00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:30.111
I do have a little army too.

00:22:31.312 --> 00:22:36.276
It's good to have collections
that make you happy, you know?

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:39.018
Being surrounded by
the ones you love most.

00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:45.125
I hope you check it out,
especially the pre-escape voice.

00:22:45.804 --> 00:22:49.885
That was really... I wasn't
sure if I was doing things right.

00:22:49.905 --> 00:22:52.400
- It was fun, but it was a bit scary.
- Yeah.

00:22:53.626 --> 00:22:57.587
We're not gonna spoil anything,
so you'll have to give it a listen.

00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:00.528
But let us know what
you thought of it, okay?

00:23:01.034 --> 00:23:04.829
I'm sure your heart will be beating
just as fast as ours were, so...

00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:05.864
Ah, you got it?

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:07.968
- Ah, thank you!
- Please listen, please listen!

00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:13.331
Oh, you bought
it, too? Thank you!

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:19.708
Well, we also, it wasn't just the
pre-escape voice that we recorded,

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:25.254
But we also did
the starting voice!

00:23:25.694 --> 00:23:27.063
You might have seen them because

00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:31.617
All the other hololive members
have been releasing them, but

00:23:31.694 --> 00:23:34.022
It's kind of nice because
with the start of Advent

00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:36.774
It's also the start of
our starting voices.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.934
We all, all of the other members
recorded in both English and Japanese.

00:23:43.014 --> 00:23:45.015
Both of them.

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:50.260
And I know, for us, like...

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.820
Not June. July.

00:23:52.121 --> 00:23:55.288
It's June. It's June, June,
June, July! July, July!

00:23:55.313 --> 00:23:56.313
It's July.

00:23:57.965 --> 00:24:03.409
But you know, for Shiori, and for
Bijou, and for Nerissa, it wasn't...

00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:06.630
It wasn't a walk in the park.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.911
No, it wasn't a walk in the park
for them to record it in Japanese.

00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.672
So, you know, we all
helped out each other.

00:24:13.092 --> 00:24:16.153
And we had a
little bit of a listen.

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:19.454
And it's really, really cute.

00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:22.674
We recommend it a lot.

00:24:23.575 --> 00:24:25.515
Please check them
out as well, okay?

00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:28.116
There's a lot of
different variations.

00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:30.916
Cute morning voices,
sleepy voices, grumpy voices.

00:24:31.156 --> 00:24:32.857
Especially Moco-chan's
grumpy voice.

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:38.552
But you never know what
it's going to quite be like, so...

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.552
"I can't wait to listen."

00:24:41.652 --> 00:24:42.652
???

00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:46.974
Please listen to
our starting voices.

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:49.254
They're both in
English and Japanese.

00:24:49.314 --> 00:24:54.715
All the Advent members did
it, so please check them out.

00:24:58.775 --> 00:25:02.056
This is very important information
for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:25:03.364 --> 00:25:04.627
We wanted to let you know that

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.767
Starting next time there will be a
new corner for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:25:08.796 --> 00:25:12.878
We'd like to introduce two new
segments called Doggie of the Day.

00:25:13.184 --> 00:25:14.434
We'll start with the first one.

00:25:15.303 --> 00:25:19.815
The next FUWAMOCO Morning
will have two new segments.

00:25:20.848 --> 00:25:24.159
The first one is called
Doggie of the Day.

00:25:26.144 --> 00:25:29.347
There's a corner called Doggie of
the Day, and we're hoping that

00:25:29.372 --> 00:25:34.047
You'll send us your best puppers for us to
introduce and brighten everyone's day.

00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:37.088
We've already seen
some very bestest friends.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280
They're so cute.

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:43.591
They've been being sent in to help
FUWAMOCO, and it's been very, very helpful.

00:25:43.631 --> 00:25:45.464
We're very happy to see it, but

00:25:45.489 --> 00:25:48.908
We'd also like to nominate them with the
FUWAMOCO Morning...

00:25:48.933 --> 00:25:52.860
- The #FWMCMORNING hashtag.
- It's in the title.

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.147
So, you know, we
can introduce them.

00:25:55.432 --> 00:25:56.770
On that topic.

00:25:57.618 --> 00:26:01.201
You tweeted.
Hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:26:02.543 --> 00:26:04.705
Maybe they have you.
Ruffians!

00:26:05.846 --> 00:26:06.846
Have you?

00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:10.233
It's okay if you don't know
what to tweet, you know.

00:26:10.516 --> 00:26:12.711
There's always BAU BAU.

00:26:14.324 --> 00:26:15.508
So...

00:26:16.462 --> 00:26:17.642
Go and tweet.
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.862 --> 00:26:19.363
#FWMCMORNING.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.577
- Or a good pupper.
- Oh, good pupper. Yeah, you know.

00:26:23.544 --> 00:26:28.705
But yes, we'll be waiting to see
your furry and fuzzy dog friends.

00:26:28.893 --> 00:26:29.893
And fluffy.

00:26:30.325 --> 00:26:31.679
- Furry and fluffy.
- Yeah.

00:26:31.704 --> 00:26:33.631
Ah, I forgot "fluffy", didn't I?

00:26:36.447 --> 00:26:40.327
But not just that, we also have the
Today I Went for a Walk segment.

00:26:43.233 --> 00:26:45.539
It's not just the Doggie
of the Day segment.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.308
- It's like "Today's Walk".
- Today I Went for a Walk.

00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:51.091
- We're doing it right.
- Yes, we are.

00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:55.121
Yeah, there's a
segment like that.

00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.342
Yes, so for Today
I Went for a Walk.

00:26:57.823 --> 00:27:00.905
We'd like to ask you to
maybe submit a picture.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.326
- If you want.
- Yeah, if you want.

00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:08.271
And a small report when you go out for a
walk using the #FWMCMORNING.

00:27:08.512 --> 00:27:09.532
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:27:11.977 --> 00:27:14.268
You know how much we
like to go for walks, right?

00:27:14.293 --> 00:27:15.293
Walks are so good.

00:27:15.598 --> 00:27:18.827
So we thought that it would make
us really happy if we could hear

00:27:18.851 --> 00:27:22.130
about all the wonderful little
adventures that you'd be going on.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.538
Usually we like to take
little photos and stuff like that

00:27:24.562 --> 00:27:27.142
to remember like "oh, this
happened today" and stuff.

00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:28.559
- Right?
- So we thought that

00:27:28.584 --> 00:27:30.403
It'd make you happy
too if you did that.

00:27:30.428 --> 00:27:31.428
You know, like...

00:27:32.326 --> 00:27:34.209
- "Today's flowers are really pretty!"
- Right?

00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:36.805
Or you saw something
like "haha, that's silly!"

00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:38.106
Those kind of things.

00:27:39.056 --> 00:27:40.817
But only if you're comfortable.

00:27:40.937 --> 00:27:43.743
Yeah, you could,
like, share a photo.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.601
Yeah, flowers, nature.

00:27:45.741 --> 00:27:47.903
Those kind of things.
Anything that made you smile.

00:27:48.163 --> 00:27:50.745
If it made you smile, then
it'll definitely make us smile.

00:27:51.543 --> 00:27:55.660
So please make sure you add the
hashtag #FWMCMORNING to your tweet.

00:27:55.685 --> 00:27:58.307
And if you could include
a sentence or two just

00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:01.353
about how your walk was,
maybe how it made you feel.

00:28:01.373 --> 00:28:02.674
Even if it's like a rainy day.

00:28:02.772 --> 00:28:06.838
Yeah, you know, just what
made today's walk extra special.

00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:08.137
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:12.065
We'll be looking forward
to your stories of

00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:15.478
Getting outside, stretching the
puppers, getting some fresh air.

00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:16.598
Those kind of things.

00:28:16.658 --> 00:28:19.459
Can you do that?

00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:21.199
We'll be waiting, okay?

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:23.560
We'll be waiting, so
make sure you do it.

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:36.046
- We also need more help.
- We need more help.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.355
We're a little bit
needy sometimes.

00:28:40.877 --> 00:28:42.179
Hopefully that's okay, but...

00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:45.702
Yes!
On tomorrow!

00:28:46.193 --> 00:28:47.282
On tomorrow!

00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:53.805
On tomorrow at 6pm PT, 9pm ET,
1am GMT, and 10am JST.

00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:56.825
From 10am Japan time.

00:28:57.093 --> 00:28:59.233
We have our first Q&amp;A stream!

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:05.555
We're gonna be doing it!

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.524
Tomorrow!
Yes, tomorrow!

00:29:08.306 --> 00:29:10.745
So we'd like you to
ask, we've seen a lot of

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:13.607
questions, a lot of really
good questions so far.

00:29:13.687 --> 00:29:16.668
But I'm sure you probably
have still lots of questions.

00:29:16.748 --> 00:29:21.709
So if you have any, please send
them to us with the hashtag, helpFWMC.

00:29:22.169 --> 00:29:24.960
And we'll pick out as
many as we can, okay?

00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:26.225
It's right there on the screen.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.571
Yeah, tomorrow, tomorrow!

00:29:29.615 --> 00:29:30.893
Is it that shocking?

00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:33.881
Well, if you can think of a
question before tomorrow, right?

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:36.714
There's a lot, a lot of
questions I think you could think of.

00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:41.456
You know, like, what's it like
being twin demon dog sisters?

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:45.618
What's life like together?

00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.659
What's Pero like?

00:29:46.699 --> 00:29:48.379
You know, those
kind of things, right?

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.601
So, we're gonna be looking
forward to your questions, okay?

00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:55.603
But is tomorrow a thing?

00:29:57.096 --> 00:29:58.096
I don't get it.

00:29:58.232 --> 00:29:59.232
Tomorrow!

00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:03.130
I'm happy, you're
happy about it.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.850
I see lots of good questions.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.683
There's a lot of good questions.

00:30:11.628 --> 00:30:18.194
I'd make us happy if you'd tweet
them with the hashtag #helpFWMC.

00:30:18.232 --> 00:30:21.860
- That's cute in Japanese. "<i>Help FUWAMOCO</i>"
- <i>Help FUWAMOCO</i>, yeah!

00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:23.251
Help me!

00:30:25.538 --> 00:30:27.539
We need a lot of help.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.281
But maybe it's a bit
more fun now, right?

00:30:31.742 --> 00:30:33.943
But that's not all!

00:30:34.604 --> 00:30:39.146
After FUWAMOCO Morning today,
later in the evening we have VLOG!

00:30:39.346 --> 00:30:40.847
Tonight!

00:30:40.907 --> 00:30:42.068
Even better than tomorrow.

00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:48.891
Yeah, tonight at 6PM PT, 9PM ET,
1AM GMT, and 10AM JST.

00:30:49.226 --> 00:30:52.064
- In Japan time, 5am...
- 10am.

00:30:53.826 --> 00:30:57.130
- You're right, 10am.
- Not 5am, 10am.

00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:58.155
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:58.606 --> 00:31:01.573
We'll be playing our
first game, Phogs.

00:31:01.873 --> 00:31:04.974
We've become a
cutie hot dog phog.

00:31:06.854 --> 00:31:09.449
We've never played it
before, but it looks very

00:31:09.473 --> 00:31:11.955
cute and colorful, and
we make cute noises.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:13.650
Yeah, BAU BAU! BAU BAU!

00:31:14.955 --> 00:31:16.650
Yeah, it's tonight!

00:31:17.604 --> 00:31:18.669
Even closer.

00:31:19.758 --> 00:31:21.319
We're really
looking forward to it.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.883
I feel like it's been such a long time since
I played a game together with you, Moco-chan.

00:31:26.383 --> 00:31:28.204
It'll be very relaxing.
I think.

00:31:28.627 --> 00:31:29.627
- Really?
- I think.

00:31:29.652 --> 00:31:31.767
We're not gonna,
like, fight or argue?

00:31:32.148 --> 00:31:33.829
I wanna go this way!
I wanna go that way!

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:37.271
If we wanna go one way
later, we can just do that later.

00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:39.833
It's not that hard.

00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:43.140
You'll have to come and check
it out to see how things go, okay?

00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:47.904
I think this is maybe the only cute
game on our schedule this week.

00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:51.047
Yeah. All of them are
sort of scary or tough.

00:31:51.107 --> 00:31:56.030
Yeah, but... It'll be okay because
you'll be there with us, right, Ruffians?

00:31:56.491 --> 00:31:58.632
Right!
You'll join us, right?

00:31:59.313 --> 00:32:00.594
Right?
Right!

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:05.618
Well... Before...

00:32:07.483 --> 00:32:12.005
Before we get going, we'd like to share our
schedule and just have another little peek.

00:32:12.428 --> 00:32:13.428
One last time.

00:32:13.453 --> 00:32:15.744
It's a bit tiny, but if you'd
like to see it a bit bigger,

00:32:15.768 --> 00:32:18.367
You can check out
our Twitter as well.

00:32:19.067 --> 00:32:24.467
We have some very exciting things
coming up and we'd really like you to

00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:29.891
make sure that you come and walk out
at our FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:32:30.232 --> 00:32:31.412
On Saturday?

00:32:31.492 --> 00:32:32.733
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.080
- On Sunday in Japan... Sunday, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:42.189
We'll have our first ever karaoke stream.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.599
We'll have our karaoke Rock n' Rawr Party.

00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:49.377
It's kind of like "<i>rokku an
rouru</i>," right? Just like that.

00:32:50.404 --> 00:32:51.724
It's got an interesting name.

00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:58.242
We'd be glad if you could join us.

00:32:58.457 --> 00:33:00.837
- We like singing, after all.
- Let's sing together!

00:33:00.864 --> 00:33:03.964
Please come and please
sing along with us, OK?

00:33:04.444 --> 00:33:05.965
- We're really excited.
- Yeah.

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:09.059
There's a lot of good
music, a lot of songs.

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:12.229
- Good songs are good!
- Good songs are good, you know?

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.672
Especially anime songs too.

00:33:14.597 --> 00:33:15.629
We hope you'll be there!

00:33:16.123 --> 00:33:19.385
We also have a
very, very mysterious

00:33:19.472 --> 00:33:22.184
Surprise stream on Sunday.

00:33:22.564 --> 00:33:24.624
So it's a question,
question, question.

00:33:24.763 --> 00:33:26.313
- What could it be?
- What could it be?

00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:27.865
- We don't know.
- Question, question, question.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.905
And also we have
Advent collab playing.

00:33:30.386 --> 00:33:32.446
- Left 4 Dead 2.
- Left 4 Dead 2.

00:33:32.626 --> 00:33:34.106
We need your
strength, so please.

00:33:34.427 --> 00:33:35.487
Please.

00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:37.655
Please, please.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.657
But I'm really looking
forward to it though.

00:33:40.682 --> 00:33:43.664
Because even though it's
kind of scary, you know,

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:49.084
Shiori and Bijou and Nerissa
will be there, so it'll be okay, right?

00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:50.725
Right.

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:57.255
Well, before we say
BAU BAU for now,

00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:03.629
We'd actually like to shout out to
some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

00:34:03.749 --> 00:34:04.749
Is that okay?

00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:08.461
Okay?

00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:11.231
- Say BAU BAU now!
- BAU BAU! OK?

00:34:12.043 --> 00:34:13.043
BAU BAU!

00:34:17.759 --> 00:34:20.243
Alex!
BAU BAU!

00:34:20.343 --> 00:34:21.823
It's so fast I can't read it!

00:34:22.223 --> 00:34:24.524
Nisha!
BAU BAU!

00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:26.789
Ryo-san!
BAU BAU!

00:34:26.944 --> 00:34:28.751
[???] BAU BAU!

00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:31.265
[???] BAU BAU!

00:34:31.546 --> 00:34:36.787
And to every other Ruffian out there,
we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:34:37.147 --> 00:34:40.108
This was today's
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:42.286
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:34:42.618 --> 00:34:45.203
BAU BAU!
