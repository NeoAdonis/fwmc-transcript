<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:23.683

00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:26.984
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:31.805

Thank you, Mococo!

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:55.975
No!

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:58.198
Moco-chan's always like this.

00:05:58.278 --> 00:05:59.739
This is how I always am!

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:00.080

That's the hashtag!

00:06:52.103 --> 00:06:53.184
You know that, right?

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.345

00:07:01.914 --> 00:07:03.875

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:04.935
It's Friday, Mofus!

00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:06.256
It's Friday!

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:07.616
We've done it!

00:07:07.776 --> 00:07:08.637
We're here!

00:07:08.797 --> 00:07:10.277
A fun weekend coming up!

00:07:11.818 --> 00:07:12.939
Right!

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.120
And there's been so many exciting things going on!

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.702
Let's get right to it, Moco-chan!

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:25.204
Well... First... Disappointment.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:27.165
Cause you know...

00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:30.493
It's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:32.415
I'm thankful but disappointed.

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:34.076
BAU BAU!

00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:37.999
Where did you see Pero this time, Ruffians?

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.120
Let's take a look.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:42.823
De-den.

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:46.006
Ah, ah, wait.

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:47.277
Huh?

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:49.878
BAUMARKET.

00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:51.779
Perroccino.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.900
BAUMARKET!

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.900
I don't know.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.521
I guess you know sometimes you run into nasty customers.

00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:02.583
You know there's lots of different types of customers out there, right?

00:08:02.603 --> 00:08:06.144
But I think you run into Pero at the store.

00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:08.125
I don't know.

00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:10.786
You think he's there for demon dog treats?

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:11.546
Really?

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:14.027
I don't know about that, you know.

00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:18.744
It seems more like maybe pudding, but I don't know if they sell pudding there.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.885
Yeah, I think they have plants, not pudding plants.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:23.565
Yeah!

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:26.406
I haven't seen Pero eating plants before.

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:30.467
Moco-chan, you could've wanted to try taking a bite out of a succulent here, right?

00:08:30.507 --> 00:08:32.348
They look delicious.

00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:35.490
I'm not going to, but they look delicious!

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.632
You never know, right?

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:43.416
Pero hasn't eaten many plants, but... He could eat dirt for all I care.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.237
He doesn't need pudding.

00:08:45.577 --> 00:08:46.758
Dirt is good enough.

00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:52.862
They do have lots of different types of soil in these kind of places, right?

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:55.484
Yeah, and it's good to try new things!

00:08:55.664 --> 00:08:56.125
Right!

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.747
Pero can try that, try some dirt!

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:02.230
Ruffians!

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.791
You know, you can try something new.

00:09:04.131 --> 00:09:05.532
That's not eating dirt.

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:06.293
Please.

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:07.514
What?

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.255
No, no dirt tasting.

00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:12.058
Just more pedo-lucky.

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:14.300
You bought him from the store.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.301
That's probably a good idea.

00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:16.882
Dicking.

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:19.324
Or you can give him some free dirt.

00:09:20.724 --> 00:09:22.267
Let's find some samples.

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:22.628
BAU BAU!

00:09:22.648 --> 00:09:27.997
Pero deserves all the pudding!

00:09:28.057 --> 00:09:29.119
All the dirt.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:34.633
BAU BAU!

00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:35.413
Ruffians!

00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:44.135
Another one of our big big dreams came true!

00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:48.617
Something that means so much to us.

00:09:49.397 --> 00:09:50.177
It happened!

00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:50.937
It happened!

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:58.619
Our first original song, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★, has reached over 1 million views on YouTube!

00:10:03.693 --> 00:10:06.362
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:11.601
It's time!

00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.182
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:18.103
The point of this battle is super duper special to us.

00:10:18.683 --> 00:10:22.724
We shared it with you during our first anniversary.

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:27.025
We were able to perform it for the very first time during our 3D debut.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:30.446
And then, you know the very first song that we performed on stage?

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:31.686
Just the two of us!

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:34.307
Breaking the mentions of battle.

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:42.070
You know, when we hit 1 million 1 million Ruffians here on YouTube, it was exactly what we were singing.

00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:43.971
So many numbers.

00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:45.052
Right!

00:10:45.272 --> 00:10:47.253
Thank you Ruffians for listening to it.

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.933
Lots and lots and lots!

00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:50.274
I get GTA 2 high.

00:10:50.334 --> 00:10:50.854
Yeah!

00:10:52.595 --> 00:10:54.276
Lots of special moments.

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:55.256
Yeah!

00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:56.317
And you know,

00:10:57.397 --> 00:11:02.078
FUWAMOCO, we know you know that music is really important to us.

00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:12.281
So to know that, Ruffians, that you enjoy our music and you want to hear more of it from us, it really means so much to us.

00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:19.743
You know, FUWAMOCO, we're gonna continue to do our best, bring even more music to you!

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:21.364
I would hope so.

00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:22.904
Yeah, I think so, Moco-chan.

00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:24.885
You know BAU will just hit 1 million.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.242
Gonna work hard and strive to reach our goal!

00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:32.645
The goal of having our own solo live one day!

00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:33.985
BAU BAU!

00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:37.948
Thank you so much for 1 million views!

00:11:38.008 --> 00:11:39.049
Ruffians!

00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:40.790
BAU BAU!

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:51.726
It's a very special day, cute Ruffians!

00:11:52.787 --> 00:11:53.727
Wow!

00:11:53.827 --> 00:12:01.130
Not just "BAU"DOL hitting 1 million, but there's been a lot of excitement and buzz going on amongst the Ruffians!

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.111
Yeah, and that's because Round1!

00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:09.113
Round1 is a chain of arcades, karaoke, entertainment centers!

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:13.075
Right now they have a very special hololive collab going on!

00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:15.956
And starting today... Wow!

00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:22.139
Dictate with some plushies!

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.040
You know FUWAMOCO plushies!

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:33.546
Not just you know the Tire Force and some other merch, but yes, around in America you can get hololive plushies!

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:34.926
Plushies!

00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:37.568

00:12:37.588 --> 00:12:39.129
FUWAMOCO plushies, yes!

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:41.930
You can bring home your own FUWAMOCO plushies!

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:44.432
Are you going tomorrow to try your luck?

00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:45.692
Good luck!

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:48.193
FUWAMOCO!

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:48.733

00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:49.573

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:49.874

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.471
BAU BAU!

00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:47.096
Hopefully your mall will include the two Ruffians.

00:13:47.896 --> 00:13:48.796

The flushies at Round1, they're limited to America.

00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:03.723
So we hope you can get your paws on more feelings.

00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:11.966
And you know, especially if you're a little bit worried you're traveling a long distance, we think it wouldn't hurt to go ahead and just see, you know?

00:14:12.007 --> 00:14:12.847
It never hurts to ask.

00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:17.770
Yeah, but we really hope that you have a ton of fun in Round1!

00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:20.392
That you do your best at the creating machines!

00:14:20.452 --> 00:14:21.353
Yeah, good luck!

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:25.376
And maybe explore the arcade games too!

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.557
Have some of the yummy FUWAMOCO foods!

00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:29.158
Yeah, and try to get the coasters too!

00:14:29.218 --> 00:14:31.780
Yeah, the random coasters!

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.542
And maybe you can do some power-ups!

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:35.183
Yeah!

00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:37.504
Maybe they have bottom, maybe they don't.

00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:39.186
We'll see!

00:14:39.266 --> 00:14:40.847
You'll have to see!

00:14:40.907 --> 00:14:41.027
But...

00:14:41.307 --> 00:14:45.109
You know, you can't afford a ticket out of your hotel room.

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:53.513
I was gonna say, Ruffians, you know, if you're not in the US and you're feeling a little sad that you can't get your paws on FUWAMOCO plushies.

00:14:53.994 --> 00:15:00.397
FUWAMOCO, our hololive friends with you has just been announced!

00:15:00.717 --> 00:15:02.398
So now you can go to the

00:15:02.758 --> 00:15:04.378
Official hololive shop!

00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:06.059
It's not that far away, huh?

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:07.759
No, it's online!

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:08.779
Just a click!

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:10.360

You're all together with Alphys!

00:15:19.982 --> 00:15:20.302
BAU BAU!

00:15:20.322 --> 00:15:21.622
But we don't have toys.

00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:22.682
Right!

00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:26.123
So, right arriving in November maybe?

00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:31.020
I'm gonna have to look forward to it.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:31.720
We sure are!

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.762
FUWAMOCO fans have a lot of fun!

00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:38.044
And soon, FUWAMOCO plushies will be in your paws too.

00:15:38.184 --> 00:15:38.745
Soon enough.

Bye bye!

Yeah, there were some problems out of all our control.

00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:16.003
But we think there was still a lot of fun to be had.

00:16:16.304 --> 00:16:23.508
And you know, especially because a special hololive English ULB album was released!

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:23.949
BAU BAU!

00:16:26.598 --> 00:16:29.139
FUWAMOCO.

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:33.140
Did you listen, Ruffians?

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:40.921
Well, you know, not just my senpai songs, but even FUWAMOCO.

00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:43.622
Born to be BAU-do and rebellion too.

00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:47.783
We now have super cool URLV versions out there.

00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:48.924
Amazing, right?

00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:50.825
It sounds so good, right?

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:51.525
Yeah!

00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:51.865
Right?

00:16:51.905 --> 00:16:52.686
Terrific!

00:16:52.786 --> 00:16:54.467
Yeah, it will be!

00:16:54.507 --> 00:16:54.907
Where?

00:16:55.187 --> 00:16:57.969
You can listen on the official hololive English channel.

00:16:58.109 --> 00:16:59.269
Yeah, there's a video.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:02.571
Yeah, I think it'll be on streaming service soon.

00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:02.751
Maybe?

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:03.231
I don't know.

00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:11.475
But a big big thank you to the crazy talented chihuahua who created these remixes!

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:13.595
Thank you!

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:20.218
This means Ruffians, now you can listen and BAU BAU at the speed of light!

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:22.398
Don't go too fast.

00:17:22.418 --> 00:17:27.400
Don't go too fast, but you know maybe you can play your own racing games at home!

00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:30.401
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:32.242
But we really love the remixes so much!

00:17:32.262 --> 00:17:34.402
We hope you listen to them lots and lots, okay?

00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:36.563
A little bit of a different ballroom vibe.

00:17:36.603 --> 00:17:58.250
And you know, in celebration of this FUWAMOCO English you'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll be- You'll

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.371
There's some stickers!

00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:00.731
Yeah!

00:18:00.892 --> 00:18:03.233
Of everybody super duper cute!

00:18:03.414 --> 00:18:07.157
The stickers you can see down here, and there's FUWAMOCO stickers too!

00:18:07.217 --> 00:18:08.758
FUWAMOCO together!

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:10.299
Yeah, you know!

00:18:10.639 --> 00:18:13.362
And a super cute illustration from Lian!

00:18:13.382 --> 00:18:13.862
Thank you!

00:18:13.882 --> 00:18:15.343
Thank you!

00:18:15.383 --> 00:18:17.064
But not just a sticker!

00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:20.727
There's also an extra special really cute thing!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.189
This time it's kind of in the style of a CD!

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.770
Right!

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.891
It's very cute!

00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:26.332
It's a CD, right?

00:18:26.812 --> 00:18:29.394
What do you think it's a record, Moco-chan?

00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:30.896
Maybe it's a record.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:34.999
A record, a CD, the round shaped thing that plays music.

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:35.199
Yes!

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.141
The round thing that plays music, yes!

00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.843
You thought it was a tire?

00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:40.364
It could be a tire.

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:42.126
It could be a tire.

00:18:42.946 --> 00:18:46.049
Maybe you'll have to get your paws on it and check it out.

00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:46.770
Is it a CD?

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.470
Is it a record?

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.951
Is it just a flattened tire?

00:18:49.032 --> 00:18:49.612
A vinyl.

00:18:50.373 --> 00:18:50.493
Oh.

00:18:51.314 --> 00:18:52.835
Isn't a record and vinyl the same thing?

00:18:54.709 --> 00:18:57.472
FUWAMOCO Final is a mystery!

00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.474
Please check it out!

00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:01.876
BAU BAU!

00:19:01.896 --> 00:19:04.939
If you put it on your record player will you hit bottom?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.941
I don't think so.

00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:09.404
I don't know if your record player is small enough.

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.786
If you have a tiny one then maybe.

00:19:17.228 --> 00:19:18.390
Only insects can hear it.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.831
BAU BAU!

00:19:25.788 --> 00:19:29.929
Wow, there's been so many things going on, you might have missed it.

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:31.589
But!

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:31.669
Wow.

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:36.270
The ultimate hololive experience is back!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.951
It was just announced that Super Expo 2025 and 6 events will be happening at Mocuhari-Vision next year!

00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:44.291
2025, March 8th and March 9th in FUWAMOCO!

00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:45.371
Six great events!

00:19:55.493 --> 00:19:58.414
BAU BAU!

00:19:58.454 --> 00:20:00.534
Here we go, Ruffians!

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.455
We're so so excited!

00:20:02.495 --> 00:20:07.116
We know FUWAMOCO will be a part of Super Expo this year!

00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:08.436
That was this year.

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:09.016
Right?

00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:10.257
That was this year!

00:20:10.317 --> 00:20:12.597
That feels like forever ago.

00:20:12.617 --> 00:20:16.658
But ya'll whole life continues!

00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:23.280
We're gonna be having Super Expo and Six Fest at Makuhari Messe!

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.600
I wonder who could be there.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:33.826
Ruffians, there's still a bunch of new FUWAMO coming soon, so please look forward to that!

00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:34.786
But!

00:20:35.207 --> 00:20:40.950
While this year's theme has been announced, the theme is hololive Arcade!

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:48.075
And what it seems like right now, they want to make the ultimate hololive drink created by you, Ruffians!

00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:50.877
I know, it's very interesting, very exciting.

00:20:51.137 --> 00:20:52.818
Maybe you know something very colorful?

00:20:52.858 --> 00:20:54.459
Gaming colors!

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.422
Lots of arcade excitement in it!

00:20:57.462 --> 00:20:59.903
Do you have drink ideas, Ruffians?

00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:01.885
RGB!

00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:03.246
You're weird!

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:04.267
You're weird!

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:06.048
You're weird!

00:21:06.588 --> 00:21:07.529
You're weird!

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.371
Soggy jewel drink!

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:10.712
Okay, I'm worried too.

00:21:11.052 --> 00:21:11.832
Nerissa's white?

00:21:13.468 --> 00:21:15.668
Wow, Abyss!

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:15.888
Hi!

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:22.910
Like, I was thinking, you know, I don't know about the drink, but there'll be something probably really delicious, like, ramune or something!

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:23.510
Yeah!

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.231
But I was thinking, you know, like, a sugar icing triangle, like the whole, like, triangle!

00:21:29.251 --> 00:21:29.351
Yeah!

00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:29.911
Have fun!

00:21:29.931 --> 00:21:34.432
Oh, like, sprinkles inside the drink, falling down, cute!

00:21:34.492 --> 00:21:34.652
Yeah!

00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:37.712
Maybe bubbles, like, popping bubbles or something!

00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:37.992
Yeah!

00:21:38.093 --> 00:21:39.613
Like, like, like, pachi pachi!

00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:40.513
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:21:41.013 --> 00:21:46.555
If you have any ideas, Ruffians are looking for all kinds of ideas in a google form.

00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:48.715
You can submit your ideas.

00:21:48.755 --> 00:21:51.796
So please go check it out.

00:21:51.896 --> 00:21:53.156
This is my moment!

00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.417
I have the ultimate hololive drink here in my brain.

00:21:57.497 --> 00:21:58.858
You do not have much time.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:03.581
You have to have your ideas by Halloween, okay?

00:22:04.882 --> 00:22:09.986
A little bit earlier than Halloween, because... Ah, true, it's JST.

00:22:10.566 --> 00:22:12.188
Before Halloween, okay?

00:22:12.348 --> 00:22:16.791
Yeah, get to work on it, huh?

00:22:16.851 --> 00:22:18.412
Please look forward to it.

00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:19.553
Nattou juice?

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:20.914
Nattou juice?

00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:21.775
I don't know.

00:22:21.795 --> 00:22:24.957
Nattou and arcade really go that well together.

00:22:25.017 --> 00:22:26.959
Not really on theme, huh?

00:22:27.874 --> 00:22:30.115
But it was a good idea.

00:22:30.895 --> 00:22:33.136
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:22:33.256 --> 00:22:40.178
Please look forward to Super Expo 2025 at 6pm!

00:22:40.198 --> 00:22:40.939
BAU BAU!

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:44.260
There's been some more announcements!

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.921
Can you believe it?

00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:48.041
The other day...

00:22:50.262 --> 00:22:55.304
Dear Calli-senpai, she had her 3.0 reveal, you know.

00:22:55.564 --> 00:22:56.805
I feel like 2.0 is just a few months ago.

00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:58.526
Right, it was just a little while ago.

00:22:58.646 --> 00:23:01.987
Calli-senpai's looking even more cute!

00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:02.307
Yeah!

00:23:02.327 --> 00:23:06.009
But she also had some really big announcements!

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:14.012
Yeah, not only just the cute 3.0 body, she announced that she's gonna be having a J-Rap 3D launch!

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:14.373
Yeah!

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:18.194
J-Rap in jigoku!

00:23:18.214 --> 00:23:18.614
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:21.876 --> 00:23:22.717
It's so cool!

00:23:22.817 --> 00:23:23.077
Right!

00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:27.220
And this live will be on October 31st at 6am P.T.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.401
Sorry, 5am.

00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:30.162
5am P.T.

00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:32.904
or 9pm JST.

00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:34.926
So it's Halloween.

00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:36.907
Before Halloween.

00:23:37.287 --> 00:23:39.689
But it's not a Halloween theme.

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:45.713
It's not a Halloween theme, but you know, Kyary-chan's already pretty Halloween, right?

00:23:45.914 --> 00:23:47.074
Yeah, it's J-Rap.

00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:48.976
J-Rap is so good.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:53.500
Ruffians, you definitely won't want to miss this one!

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:10.900
I think this is gonna be very very cool, Ruffians!

00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:17.186
I think you know that you'll definitely not want to miss your halloween!

00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:19.909
Even though you might be up late on halloween.

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:23.012
It's also a good idea to maybe be awake.

00:24:24.123 --> 00:24:25.423
Halloween too!

00:24:25.443 --> 00:24:25.783
Yeah!

00:24:26.263 --> 00:24:30.464
You know you're gonna eat a lot of candy anyways, so you'll be able to stay up, right?

00:24:30.864 --> 00:24:31.944
All that sugar!

00:24:32.084 --> 00:24:32.844
How does that work?

00:24:32.884 --> 00:24:34.545
You... It's in the morning of Halloween.

00:24:34.625 --> 00:24:35.085
You eat... You eat candy!

00:24:36.233 --> 00:24:50.890
You eat candy at 5am, and then you eat candy at 8am, and then you eat more candy all throughout the day, and then before you know it, it's midnight!

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.233
Halloween!

00:24:52.868 --> 00:24:53.228
Not candy

00:24:55.049 --> 00:24:56.269
Candy-o-pe!

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.250
Candy-o-pe?

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.050
Yeah.

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:02.151
BAU BAU!

00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:09.013
The Calli Senpai also revealed an MV for her song Lose, Lose, Dance!

00:25:09.073 --> 00:25:10.734
Did you see it, Abyss?

00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:13.815
That was super special, very emotional, you know?

00:25:13.835 --> 00:25:20.557
It includes all of Myth and, you know, really talks about the journey that they've been on all together over the years.

00:25:21.517 --> 00:25:22.978
It was really, really sweet.

00:25:23.018 --> 00:25:26.260
But if you want to be a bit emotional, we recommend it!

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.440
I was getting teary.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:27.880
Right!

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.401
Please check it out, Ruffians!

00:25:30.501 --> 00:25:32.963
We really liked it!

00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:34.904
It's such a good MV, right?

00:25:35.004 --> 00:25:37.205
Yeah, it really brought to me.

00:25:37.325 --> 00:25:38.985
Please check it out!

00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:45.865
Wow, Ruffians!

00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:51.412
We also have an important announcement to share with you today, Ruffians!

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:05.763
FUWAMOCO Morning will be going into a hibernation period starting next Friday.

00:26:05.983 --> 00:26:07.825
But Ruffians, don't be late!

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:09.147
Don't be late, okay?

00:26:09.247 --> 00:26:14.232
It will be back on Monday, March 10th at 8AM PT.

00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:20.400
This is also together, you know, with the daylight, ceilings, time changes, everything.

00:26:25.824 --> 00:26:33.830
FUWAMOCO Morning is something that's really special to both you and us.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.173
It's hard for us to see go into a little bit of a hibernation time.

00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:45.818
You know us Ruffians, we've been running at top speed since the moment we debuted!

00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:50.041
And you know, we both feel like we need to prioritize our health now!

00:26:50.061 --> 00:26:56.706
So that's what we're going to do as well, is focus on all the things we want to explore that we haven't been able to yet!

00:26:56.726 --> 00:26:59.788
You know, there's a lot of things we really want to do!

00:26:59.828 --> 00:27:01.589
A lot of things upcoming!

00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:06.432
So we're going to aim to do those things as well as put our health on priority!

00:27:07.473 --> 00:27:11.662
I know, but we'll really miss spending mornings together with you.

00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:16.432
Especially, you know, in those colder months when it's hard to get out of bed.

00:27:17.283 --> 00:27:20.164
It's a bittersweet decision, but we're still here!

00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:20.644
Yes!

00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:23.344
And we'll be doing even more cool things!

00:27:23.364 --> 00:27:24.425
Yeah, okay!

00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:27.005
And of course, we'll be streaming too, okay?

00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:34.127
And like we said, FUWAMOCO Morning will be back when the clocks change again, March 10th at 8AM PT!

00:27:34.207 --> 00:27:34.707
Got it!

00:27:35.067 --> 00:27:36.367
Okay, Ruffians!

00:27:36.407 --> 00:27:39.888
Yeah, so you better make up for it, okay?

00:27:40.068 --> 00:27:45.550
Until then, let's enjoy the next FUWAMOCO Mornings we have together, okay?

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:45.650
Okay!

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.030
BAU BAU!

00:27:48.512 --> 00:27:50.374
It starts next Friday, okay?

00:27:50.474 --> 00:27:54.959
Next Friday will be the last FUWAMOCO Morning before High Foundation, okay?

00:27:54.999 --> 00:27:56.961
So let's enjoy it together!

00:27:57.042 --> 00:28:02.148
Thank you so much, Mocos, for always being here with us in FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:02.168 --> 00:28:02.929
BAU BAU!

00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:13.569
Let's check out today's Doggie of the Day!

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:22.212
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Totoro!

00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:27.114
Dominic Totoro!

00:28:27.194 --> 00:28:28.395
Where ears?

00:28:28.455 --> 00:28:29.715
Triangle ears.

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:30.456
Where ears?

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.980
What world is this?

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.582
I can see a square there too, but I guess it's most commonly referred to as Perfectly Triangle.

00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:40.042
Yes.

00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:40.682
But!

00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:41.662
Well Totoro!

00:28:41.702 --> 00:28:44.443
Totoro has a very important job.

00:28:44.783 --> 00:28:50.044
Not only is he the guard dog of his Ruffians, their family, but also a secret agent.

00:28:50.564 --> 00:28:51.004
Secret agent?

00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:54.685
Yeah.

00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:57.945
No one knows what his job exactly entails.

00:28:58.685 --> 00:29:00.746
But it's probably best this way, you know.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:09.123
I hear it looks so cheetah, but apparently it's a little bit vicious.

00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:11.505
He also loves to bite sandals.

00:29:11.605 --> 00:29:13.086
As long as it's just sandals.

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:17.468
I think it's just sandals.

00:29:17.488 --> 00:29:17.548
Yes!

00:29:17.628 --> 00:29:19.329
Moco-chan had his Totoro BAU BAU.

00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:19.689
BAU!

00:29:19.749 --> 00:29:20.150
BAU!

00:29:31.147 --> 00:29:41.413
Wow, I wouldn't expect that, but you know I guess it is Totoro!

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:45.975
We have a very fluffy and mini secret agent here!

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:46.655
Totoro!

00:29:50.578 --> 00:29:56.584
I feel like right now, I'm very glad that I'm not a sandal.

00:29:56.724 --> 00:30:01.529
I'm not a sandal!

00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:04.391
I'm Mococo!

00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:05.893
I'm not a sandal!

00:30:05.973 --> 00:30:06.513
I'm Fuwawa!

00:30:06.553 --> 00:30:08.816
I don't think we can take him down, right?

00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:16.896
I think these Ruffians, you know, they have a very special doggy protecting their smiles.

00:30:17.436 --> 00:30:20.178
BAU BAU!

00:30:20.198 --> 00:30:22.099
Ruffians!

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.121
You've been out taking some walks.

00:30:25.205 --> 00:30:27.367
Let's see where you've been!

00:30:27.447 --> 00:30:29.188
Today, I went on a walk!

00:30:29.768 --> 00:30:30.689
Wee-haw!

00:30:31.409 --> 00:30:33.871
De-den!

00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:37.713
You went to the Chill Travel event in Taichung!

00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:39.274
Chill Travel!

00:30:39.314 --> 00:30:42.577
We're so happy!

00:30:42.637 --> 00:30:47.080
It looks like you had tons of fun, and together with your friend Kevin, too!

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.840
And pon-de-rings!

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.522
Oh my gosh, so many!

Right.

00:31:21.912 --> 00:31:24.313
Next we have our Question of the Day!

00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:27.795
The Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:31:28.195 --> 00:31:32.637
What kind of outfits do you like to see fans make for you the most?

00:31:32.817 --> 00:31:36.819
Should they be reposted if you take a long time returning to the game?

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:38.840
Good question!

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.462
FUWAMOCO we're always so so happy with our fans' outfits!

00:31:43.482 --> 00:31:45.423
They're really anything you'd like to see!

00:31:45.463 --> 00:31:48.084
We're so happy and love seeing what you're up to!

Not always, but just sometimes.

00:32:32.813 --> 00:32:33.474
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:53.352 --> 00:32:54.372
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:59.994
Thank you again for all your submissions for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:00.034 --> 00:33:05.476
There's only a week of FUWAMOCO Morning before hibernation.

00:33:05.716 --> 00:33:10.017
So we'd really love to be able to see your Doggie of the Day!

00:33:10.217 --> 00:33:13.438
And all the sightings you may have had happen.

00:33:14.558 --> 00:33:15.979
Questions!

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:18.920
Or you know, the walks that you've been going on.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.661
Please let us know with the hashtag!

00:33:26.823 --> 00:33:29.964

00:33:30.364 --> 00:33:33.365
Well, let's take a look at our next stream coming up here!

00:33:33.425 --> 00:33:36.466
Our next stream is De-den!

00:33:36.506 --> 00:33:38.427
Five Nights at Freddy's!

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:42.316
It's Friday!

00:33:42.356 --> 00:33:44.797
Which means Friday night at Freddy's!

00:33:44.938 --> 00:33:45.698
But five nights.

00:33:46.198 --> 00:33:49.519
Last time we know, we were so close to beating one.

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:54.061
Apparently we did very well, but I think that's because of the Ruffians helping us.

00:33:54.421 --> 00:34:00.564
So we're gonna need your help again so we can get through all five night at Freddy's, okay Ruffians?

00:34:00.884 --> 00:34:06.366
We hope that you'll join us and kinda get a little bit of a head start into the Halloween spookiness.

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.707
It's not harder.

00:34:10.313 --> 00:34:12.434
Sometimes, you know, when I make a sequel, it's like, huh?

00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:16.291
I think it's pretty easy, you know?

00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:17.694
Please help us!

00:34:18.034 --> 00:34:25.266
We'll also be doing a watchalog of Mikochi-senpai's Solo Live!

00:34:25.286 --> 00:34:26.588
That starts at 1.45am!

00:34:26.608 --> 00:34:32.178
It's a little bit early, but it's Mikochi-senpai's first Solo Live!

00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:35.784
We're so live and we're so excited to be able to see it!

00:34:35.804 --> 00:34:38.729
So you know if you can't sleep, yeah I can't sleep.

00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:39.586
Right.

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:42.347
Maybe you can sort of check it out a bit.

00:34:42.407 --> 00:34:43.788
Yeah, please join us!

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:48.109
We are really happy because we got Mikochi-senpai phone last time.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:51.330
We got to wish her best of luck beforehand.

00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:52.771
Will she cry?

00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:53.931
Will we cry?

00:34:53.951 --> 00:34:55.732
That's the question.

00:34:56.072 --> 00:34:58.013
We'll have to see!

00:34:58.153 --> 00:34:59.753
BAU BAU!

00:35:00.093 --> 00:35:04.515
And then on Saturday evening, we're playing Vsauce.

00:35:05.832 --> 00:35:08.573
I think this is maybe the scariest horror game.

00:35:08.954 --> 00:35:12.215
As you know, most horror games are very scary to us.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.896
So why is FUWAMOCO playing the scariest one?

00:35:14.936 --> 00:35:18.458
We told Kelly-senpai that we're playing this one and she chuckled.

00:35:19.399 --> 00:35:26.062
We're playing it because Fubuki-senpai recommended we do it.

00:35:27.753 --> 00:35:35.477
And then on Sunday we're gonna be having a nice cozy chatting stream.

00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:38.159
We chatted about a bunch of things that's been going on.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:41.801
Lots of stuff has been going on.

00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:44.142
I feel like it's really overdue right now.

00:35:44.182 --> 00:35:45.523
I wanna talk Ruffians.

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:47.104
When was the other potential thing?

00:35:47.564 --> 00:35:48.204
Oh that's before.

00:35:51.722 --> 00:35:53.183
So look out for that too!

00:35:53.223 --> 00:35:54.225

00:35:54.305 --> 00:35:59.190

00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:24.143
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:36:29.967 --> 00:36:31.429
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:48.609 --> 00:37:02.417
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!
