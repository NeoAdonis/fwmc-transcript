00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.184
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:09.944 --> 00:05:13.285
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:15.665
BAU BAU!

00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:20.006
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:21.747
BAU BAU!

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:25.227
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:28.088
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.909
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.849
BAU BAU!

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.314
And today, we're your hosts, the FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:42.799
Thank you for joining us Ruffians today for our 51st episode!

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:44.601
Can you say that okay?

00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:44.681
51st.

00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:44.861
51st.

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.923
That's the right way, right?

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:47.183
51st.

00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:48.444
The 51st episode!

00:05:48.484 --> 00:05:48.844
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.884 --> 00:05:50.186
BAU BAU!

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:50.526
51st.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:53.529
Is that wrong?

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.051
I don't know, somehow it sounds wrong.

00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:56.111
51st.

00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:56.311
51st.

00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:04.307
BAU BAU!

00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:05.811
51st on December 1st.

00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:21.906
Well, Ruffians, if you're just joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:27.088
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:32.490
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.782
Please tweet all your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:44.869
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:47.112
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:51.519
It kind of feels like, you know, it's a new month.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:54.100
Feels like a new week, but it's not.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.140
Are you warmed up for today?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.341
I'm warmed up.

00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.441
Do you feel a bit cold?

00:06:58.901 --> 00:06:59.561
I do, actually.

00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:00.462
I say I'm warmed up.

00:07:00.702 --> 00:07:07.404
I do feel a bit cold, a bit... Yeah, the bones don't quite move as smoothly.

00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:09.924
It's the somber first, you know?

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:11.885
It's a bit chilly, huh?

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:16.106
That is why Moco-chan did any Ruffians see Perroccino.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:17.627
Let's see!

00:07:18.832 --> 00:07:23.976
Do we have Pero Sighting?

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:32.644
De-den!

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.086
It is Pero.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:37.568
It's a Pero Sighting.

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:43.193
At first I thought someone had broken into your very nice looking car there.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.706
It's just Pero.

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:48.226
Yeah.

00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:48.886
Just Pero.

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:52.428
It would be really awful if your window was smashed, you know?

00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:55.549
But that's not uncommon in the big cities, right?

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:56.289
Right?

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.650
Yeah, but... At least you know Pero is just sleeping.

00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:01.731
Just sleeping.

00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:08.033
I feel like he's the best when he's knocked out cold in a deep slumber, you know?

00:08:08.373 --> 00:08:08.593
Yeah.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:10.514
He almost kind of looks cute.

00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:13.095
Even a bit curly.

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:17.390
Ruffians, do you think so too?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:18.831
Not so cool.

00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:20.452
Oh, like sleeping.

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:26.555
Like a... Not cuddly, you agree!

00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:30.637
Well, that's interesting, but... You wouldn't go down, why?

00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:33.238
You would never cuddle Pero.

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:35.720
Probably best for your own safety.

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:41.624
But you know, I think it's probably best that you let him sleep undisturbed there, you know?

00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:44.445
You won't like him if you wake him up before he's ready.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:50.307
You know, he's kinda like Fuwawa when you accidentally wake him up.

00:08:55.289 --> 00:08:56.129
This way to the sink.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:06.091
Hopefully, though, he went on his way once he was rested up and, you know, there was no damage to your car or anything.

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:11.172
Unless, you know, maybe you decided to chop him in there.

00:09:11.312 --> 00:09:11.572
What?

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:12.612
Thank you!

00:09:12.732 --> 00:09:16.973
Thank you for letting us know that you saw Pero!

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:18.693
He had a good sleep, yeah.

00:09:18.733 --> 00:09:21.634
But, you know, maybe he should be working a little bit harder, huh?

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:23.817
BAU BAU!

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:38.165
Well, you can't just be sleeping like that in other places, okay?

00:09:39.286 --> 00:09:44.229
Well, in happier news, we actually have something great!

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:46.090
Ruffians!

00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:49.473
We've been breaking a lot of milestones recently.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:52.795
Almost every FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:09:52.815 --> 00:09:58.499
Well, this time, we hit 300,000 followers on Twitter!

00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:04.823
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:05.023 --> 00:10:06.224
BAU BAU!

00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:10.067
Thank you so much for making Twitter a fun place, Ruffians.

00:10:10.507 --> 00:10:14.910
We hope that you know that maybe we've been able to make it a fun place for you too.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:21.895
We hope that we can do more fun things, more Twitter spaces, and even some more silly tweets in the future.

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:28.200
We love it when you respond to us and are just silly and kind with other Ruffians there.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.041
Thank you so much for making it a wonderful community.

00:10:33.662 --> 00:10:36.382
Please, please look forward to our next Rhyme Response 2!

00:10:36.442 --> 00:10:38.863
Can you do a Rhyme Response?

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:41.104
This one.

00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:42.985
Go looking for it.

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:46.866
You Ruffians, you respond to us, and we respond to you!

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:49.393
Moco-chan.

00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:10.578
I wonder when that will be.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.018
Maybe soon.

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:15.639
Well, no spoilers.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:16.639
Maybe soon.

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:22.940
But here's to hoping that we're able to connect with you even more through the power of Twitter.

00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.241
BAU BAU!

00:11:26.681 --> 00:11:28.341
Not Howl and Hunt.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.161
Not today.

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:31.222
Not tomorrow.

00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:34.362
We'll give you more warning before that.

00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:35.903
Not today!

00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:37.723
Not tomorrow!

00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:38.993
What is it?

00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:39.794
I don't know.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:40.496
Oh.

00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:41.458
Sometimes.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.041
BAU BAU!

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.604
BAU BAU!

00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:50.277
Now there's been more updates on Ruffians!

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.780
Actually, you know, we're still puppies.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:54.761
Still puppies.

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:55.962
Puppies are new dogs.

00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:59.865
New dogs can do new tricks.

00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:04.468
And so, we tried something new, Ruffians!

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:11.914
Finally, after a long time of trying and just not having enough time and kind of forgetting.

00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:14.076
Forgetting, maybe a bit of a lot of forgetting.

00:12:14.963 --> 00:12:18.745
We made our first post on Reddit!

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:19.866
Yeah!

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.747
Reddit, that's the website!

00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:23.408
On the hololive Reddit.

00:12:23.508 --> 00:12:25.730
There's us going BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.650
Yeah!

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.592
Thank you for welcoming us there to Ruffians, okay?

00:12:29.612 --> 00:12:31.633
Redditor Ruffians!

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:33.815
We know you so much!

00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:36.796
You know, we still don't really know too much about Reddit.

00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:42.060
We hope to be able to interact with you and other hololive fans there in the future!

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.561
And you know, also see a

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:46.744
Maybe what you're up to sometimes.

00:12:46.804 --> 00:12:48.726
While we're at it.

00:12:48.946 --> 00:12:51.469
So you might see us around there.

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.191
Just maybe.

00:12:53.852 --> 00:12:54.813
Maybe making posts.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.034
Maybe commenting.

00:12:56.455 --> 00:13:01.020
But for Reddit we don't really get it still.

00:13:03.186 --> 00:13:11.936
Somehow Ruffians, thanks to your very warm welcome, it seems like we made it to all on Reddit.

00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:17.021
I don't know, but somehow we got almost a million views!

00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:19.044
It seems pretty crazy.

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.226
One million people here!

00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:22.347
Let's BAU BAU!

00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:23.369
Right, right!

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:32.260
Maybe that means we were some people's first exposure to Vtubers the other day.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.820
Maybe!

00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:34.261
That would be funny, huh?

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.763
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:13:38.163 --> 00:13:43.025
Well, we hope that if we were their first, you know, that they thought we were neat.

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:50.369
And, you know, if they didn't, well, we hope that they found something else on Reddit that they also thought was neat.

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:51.149
Yeah!

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.510
You know,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.832
Ruffians, we're going to do our best there.

00:13:56.432 --> 00:13:59.654
Hopefully we don't make any silly mistakes or anything.

00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:00.335
If we do, we do.

00:14:00.355 --> 00:14:01.175
Can we make reddit mistakes?

00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:01.615
I don't know.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:02.616
If we do, we do.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:06.618
We're looking forward to having lots of fun there too!

00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:08.179
BAU BAU!

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:13.418
BAU BAU can't wait for episode 75 of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:13.838 --> 00:14:15.279
Thank you for looking forward to it.

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:16.879
You're gonna have to wait a little bit.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.401
BAU BAU!

00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:24.082
Well, there's been more exciting things.

00:14:24.502 --> 00:14:28.624
Because as you know, Ruffians, it's officially December 1st!

00:14:28.644 --> 00:14:29.584
It is.

00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:31.825
That means it's the last month of the year.

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:32.365
Indeed.

00:14:33.927 --> 00:14:44.382
We hope it's been a great year for you, but Ruffians, if maybe you feel like you need a little bit more cheer, especially holiday cheer, we have just the thing!

00:14:50.143 --> 00:14:53.964
hololive English Advent Calendar is back this year!

00:14:54.484 --> 00:14:55.104
It's back!

00:14:55.204 --> 00:14:56.365
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:56.505 --> 00:15:00.126
And of course, the video has already been revealed!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.707
You know, we have Kiara-senpai there looking mighty.

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:06.187
Santa.

00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:07.167
Ruffians.

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:20.134
We also have some very, uh, we have very, very cute thumbnails by Pongsamori!

00:15:20.855 --> 00:15:27.700
But you know, there'll be something new and special every day for you unveiled at 4pm PT leading up to Christmas.

00:15:28.321 --> 00:15:35.827
And you know, as FUWAMOCO, we were actually a part of the first video in the advent calendar.

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:37.228
Did you see it?

00:15:37.248 --> 00:15:41.331
We sung a silly song with Kiara-senpai and Calli-senpai and Nerissa!

00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:42.712
Yeah, Fuwawa.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:52.196
If you haven't checked it out yet, please do!

00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:52.876
You liked it!

00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:54.578
Thank you!

00:15:54.618 --> 00:15:55.378
It was very silly.

00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:57.640
It was.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.303
Please go check it out at holoen-advent.com.

00:16:00.443 --> 00:16:07.249
That's holoen-advent.com.

00:16:07.729 --> 00:16:10.211
And that way you can view the Advent calendar.

00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:14.115
Please don't forget to click through the days to look at the previous videos too.

00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:17.097
I think if you go now it'll be like day 2 and it won't have a video.

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.639
But you just need to click.

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.460
Go to day 1 and you can see the video.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.942
Otherwise you have to wait until 4pm.

00:16:23.363 --> 00:16:25.585
You don't want to wait all the time, huh?

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.046
But it'll be a lot of fun!

00:16:27.146 --> 00:16:28.447
Okay, so don't miss them.

00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:29.148
Got it?

00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:33.483
Why don't you, maybe, I know maybe it's not good.

00:16:33.883 --> 00:16:38.446
Maybe you might get in trouble, but you could leave the tab open.

00:16:39.186 --> 00:16:44.049
And you know, refresh every day for a new video.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.570
That's a good idea, Moco-chan.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.431
You don't have a lot of tabs open, right Ruffians?

00:16:48.451 --> 00:16:50.512
Right.

00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:55.315
Right, good idea.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:56.496
Smart thinking.

00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:58.357
I don't have a lot of tabs open either.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.115
Yeah!

00:17:02.175 --> 00:17:05.098
BAU BAU!

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:18.313
And we also made our first appearance on the official hololive English YouTube channel the other day with Kiara-senpai, Calli-senpai, and IRyS-senpai.

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:19.834
Because...

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:27.437
Well, we wanted to talk about the hololive English Concert, Connect the World that happened in LA during the summer.

00:17:27.897 --> 00:17:30.218
And, uh, well, Ruffians, did you watch it?

00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:35.599
It was before, a little bit before Advent debuted.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.221
You know, Advent was actually even teased first at that concert.

00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:43.501
You did!

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:44.922
You remember that?

00:17:49.966 --> 00:17:52.630
If you haven't watched the concert yet, it's good.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.795
It's good still because you still have that chance, that extra special chance.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:03.543
But, well, in fact for us it was a very very special concert so we are really happy to be able to

00:18:04.941 --> 00:18:09.766
Share our feelings and our thoughts on it, especially with all our other senpai you know.

00:18:10.007 --> 00:18:13.030
And you know we also made a very special announcement!

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.711
Yeah!

00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:17.415
There will be a BLUE RAY RELEASE!

00:18:17.515 --> 00:18:19.077
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:18:19.137 --> 00:18:20.879
BAU RELEASE!

00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:21.479
BAU RELEASE!

00:18:24.022 --> 00:18:25.563
It's really, really amazing, right?

00:18:25.883 --> 00:18:27.904
We're so lucky, Ruffians!

00:18:28.064 --> 00:18:32.207
You know, a lot of hard work goes into making the physical releases like this.

00:18:32.547 --> 00:18:35.488
So we hope that you'll want to get your paws on it.

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:42.312
And maybe, you know, one day, if Advent gets to perform at a hololive English Concert... Again?

00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:43.053
Again?

00:18:43.613 --> 00:18:44.033
Not again.

00:18:45.694 --> 00:18:46.455
Someday!

00:18:46.635 --> 00:18:47.375
Not again!

00:18:47.455 --> 00:18:48.015
Someday!

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:48.576
You know.

00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:55.478
That there will be a physical release on it so that we can watch it over and over and over and treasure all the moments forever and ever.

00:18:55.738 --> 00:18:56.738
That would be nice.

00:18:57.018 --> 00:18:58.178
It's a lot of hoping.

00:18:59.159 --> 00:18:59.899
We'll be waiting too!

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:00.499
Thank you!

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.759
We'll be waiting too!

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:02.780
But, guess what?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.960
You don't need to wait for the blu-ray to connect the world.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.641
Although maybe you do a little bit, but...

00:19:08.141 --> 00:19:11.523
It's coming so very soon!

00:19:11.563 --> 00:19:23.548
And if you happen to watch the stream of the concert live too, on the Blu-ray there are different camera angles and name changes made too, so I'm sure that you'll find new things that surprise you too!

00:19:24.048 --> 00:19:25.349
Lots of things to enjoy!

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:28.551
BAU BAU!

00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:29.711
Very exciting.

00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:33.493
Who would think a Blu-ray release?

00:19:35.253 --> 00:19:39.476
Well, Ruffians, the next... Well, it's sort of exciting.

00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:40.677
This is crazy!

00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:41.718
Sort of crazy.

00:19:41.738 --> 00:19:43.039
Mind-blowing.

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:44.020
Mind-blowing.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.321
Mind-boggling.

00:19:45.341 --> 00:19:46.622
Wow.

00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:47.883
Yeah.

00:19:48.503 --> 00:19:53.247
Well, Ruffians, you know how we played hololive Suica, right?

00:19:53.287 --> 00:19:54.968
Because there was a big update!

00:19:55.008 --> 00:20:01.113
Like the DM members, ID members, and FUWAMOCO too!

00:20:01.213 --> 00:20:03.295
But, Mumei-senpai!

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:07.087
She was playing Holosuika before bed.

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.509
You know, something that we often do too, but look.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.711
Look at this.

00:20:18.013 --> 00:20:21.835
Not only did she get over 10k, but she broke 15,000!

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:26.398
That's absolutely bonkers.

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:27.319
Bonkers.

00:20:28.379 --> 00:20:29.160
How did she do it?

00:20:31.045 --> 00:20:31.865
How did she do it?

00:20:32.385 --> 00:20:40.687
I mean, I think you... It's kind of that solid foundation that she has at the bottom, you know, with the Fuwawas and the Mococos near each other, right?

00:20:40.727 --> 00:20:43.187
Yeah, it's very definitely the key to that.

00:20:43.307 --> 00:20:49.349
Yeah, it's because of the beautiful harmony that only we can create as twin sisters.

00:20:49.389 --> 00:20:50.889
The harmony that we provide.

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:52.949
She was able to create such an amazing score.

00:20:52.969 --> 00:20:53.970
Definitely, definitely.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.670
Yes, we built up the amazing score for her, that's for sure.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.031
It's a strong base, right?

00:21:02.588 --> 00:21:06.571
Well, I hope that Mumei-senpai had fun.

00:21:07.072 --> 00:21:09.794
That it was a good game.

00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:13.237
Maybe this is it.

00:21:14.218 --> 00:21:17.500
We're giving up on getting the highest score in hololive English.

00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:20.463
I don't think we can even get close to that.

00:21:24.588 --> 00:21:26.092
I guess Mumei-senpai, you can have it.

00:21:26.112 --> 00:21:26.513
She deserves it.

00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:36.002
BAU BAU!

00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:36.462
Ruffians!

00:21:36.703 --> 00:21:38.544
No, you guys don't do it!

00:21:38.624 --> 00:21:40.586
Thank you for believing in us!

00:21:40.626 --> 00:21:41.246
That's very nice.

00:21:41.286 --> 00:21:42.007
Thank you!

00:21:42.407 --> 00:21:43.588
BAU BAU!

00:21:43.648 --> 00:21:46.270
Congratulations, Ruby Senpai!

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.611
BAU BAU!

00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:49.232
That's amazing.

00:21:49.753 --> 00:21:50.273
It's crazy.

00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:52.235
I don't know if I believe it.

00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:56.578
I know, I was kind of thinking, Ruby Senpai's pretty smart, maybe.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:58.680
But no.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.662
But no, she didn't do anything wrong.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:04.943
Naughty.

00:22:05.983 --> 00:22:07.544
She didn't do anything naughty, okay?

00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:08.204
No.

00:22:08.964 --> 00:22:10.285
Yeah.

00:22:11.165 --> 00:22:15.327
On this topic, nice to do FUWAMOCO!

00:22:15.787 --> 00:22:18.288
Because Ruffians, it's a new month.

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:19.289
It's a new month.

00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:23.670
A new month and we're definitely starting it off on the right paw.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.911
Yeah.

00:22:24.211 --> 00:22:24.751
Cause you know,

00:22:25.851 --> 00:22:28.293
We're FUWAMOCO!

00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:40.802
So we're happy to announce that we'll be starting the summer off with... No Misunderstandings!

00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:45.025
This is very very accurate, as always.

00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:47.987
The majority of days have no misunderstandings.

00:22:48.047 --> 00:22:50.429
This is how it goes.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:51.810
Every day.

00:22:53.331 --> 00:23:03.699
Let's make sure that we do well, that we have no misunderstandings this month at all, and that way, Yagoo Santa-san will visit us this year, okay?

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:05.120
Okay, Ruffians?

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.001
You're part of this too, okay?

00:23:08.943 --> 00:23:11.745
We want Yagoo Santa-san to visit you, right?

00:23:12.065 --> 00:23:12.525
Right.

00:23:13.706 --> 00:23:14.046
Yes.

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.047
I thought you would be excited!

00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:39.815
I guess Ruffians don't have that kind of aspirations, huh?

00:23:41.716 --> 00:23:45.158
What if we want Yagoo-san to visit us?

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:46.799
Are you gonna help?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.741
Help us with no misunderstandings!

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:54.784
Ho ho ho, sou desu ne.

00:23:55.865 --> 00:23:58.847
You're not helping the misunderstandings, Fuwawa!

00:23:58.927 --> 00:24:00.948
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:24:02.677 --> 00:24:02.817
Huh?

00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:05.198
We want to be on the good list.

00:24:05.858 --> 00:24:06.219
Yeah.

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:08.540
Are we on the good list?

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.881
Or are we naughty puppies?

00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:15.763
Which hololive members are on the back?

00:24:15.803 --> 00:24:16.463
Ruffians.

00:24:17.944 --> 00:24:18.264
Yes?

00:24:18.744 --> 00:24:19.725
What does that mean?

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:20.025
Yes!

00:24:23.982 --> 00:24:27.445
I don't think there's a misunderstanding here because it says right there.

00:24:27.906 --> 00:24:30.268
Days without misunderstandings.

00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:31.609
One.

00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:32.189
One.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.970
Okay?

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.511
Yeah.

00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:37.734
Yagoo-san desai is gonna be here, okay?

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:38.415
Yeah.

00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:42.266
BAU BAU!

00:24:42.466 --> 00:24:44.547
BAU BAU, PREPARE!

00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:48.209
Well, Moco-chan, let's go to our regular corner.

00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:51.170
Starting with our Doggie of the Day!

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.031
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:24:53.071 --> 00:24:56.033
We have... De-den!

00:24:56.293 --> 00:24:58.874
WALL-E!

00:24:59.314 --> 00:25:00.975
WALL-E FOR SHORT!

00:25:01.015 --> 00:25:03.677
WALL-E!

00:25:03.717 --> 00:25:04.757
WALL-E!

00:25:04.877 --> 00:25:06.038
WALL-E!

00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:07.498
I want to hug his face.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.840
He's like, this is his expression.

00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:16.911
I just wanted to take his face and flop it all around, you know?

00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:20.153
He looks like he could fly.

00:25:23.354 --> 00:25:28.617
He's this Ruffian's cousin's dog, and apparently he's very friendly and naughty.

00:25:28.937 --> 00:25:30.318
That's a good combination.

00:25:30.998 --> 00:25:32.639
But which list is he going to be on?

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:34.560
The best one.

00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:39.962
He loves playing with people and running around too.

00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:44.022
I kind of want to ruff house with him.

00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:46.344
I want to hear him go BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:49.566
I want to play growl with him.

00:25:49.726 --> 00:25:50.466
It would be good.

00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:52.187
I think it would be fun!

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:55.209
Very cute.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.412
How does Wally bow bow?

00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:03.113
I think it's sort of a deep bow.

00:26:03.994 --> 00:26:05.535
BAU.

00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:05.975
BAU.

00:26:07.076 --> 00:26:08.316
I think it's like a BAU.

00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:09.517
BAU.

00:26:10.097 --> 00:26:10.278
What?

00:26:13.098 --> 00:26:20.902
It sounds like a frog.

00:26:20.922 --> 00:26:23.483
Don't make fun of Wally!

00:26:23.503 --> 00:26:25.604
That's not how he sounds!

00:26:25.644 --> 00:26:26.925
Don't make fun of Wally!

00:26:26.965 --> 00:26:27.946
That's rude, Moco-chan!

00:26:30.177 --> 00:26:36.701
Well, I think Wally looks like the kind of friend that you really want to go on adventures with.

00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:43.385
A doggie that will definitely make you laugh and paint lots of memorable moments together with.

00:26:43.646 --> 00:26:46.808
Especially since he likes to be naughty sometimes too.

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:52.370
Memorable in a good way.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.652
Being naughty is okay because I think sometimes we all like to be a bit naughty too.

00:26:57.752 --> 00:27:00.813
It makes for a silly and fun life, right?

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:03.534
Hi.

00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:09.396
Even though you know, YAGOO Santa-san needs to visit us too, so we gotta make sure that we're okay.

00:27:09.436 --> 00:27:11.157
Well, we better prepare too, okay?

00:27:11.893 --> 00:27:14.294
BAU BAU!

00:27:16.314 --> 00:27:20.915
Well, I'm feeling pretty chilly right now, but how are the Ruffians doing?

00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:22.315
You're not feeling too chilly?

00:27:22.335 --> 00:27:23.535
How are your walks?

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.376
How are the walks going?

00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:26.436
Let's see!

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:28.896
Today I went on a walk.

00:27:28.976 --> 00:27:30.497
Where did this Ruffian go for a walk?

00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:31.097
De-den!

00:27:31.197 --> 00:27:31.977
That's winking.

00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:38.748
It looks so real!

00:27:39.228 --> 00:27:40.849
It's so beautiful!

00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:46.770
I don't know, somehow this photo looks both very cold and extremely warm at the same time.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.830
Don't you think, Moco-chan?

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.091
No, I think it just looks very, very cold.

00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:51.091
Not warm.

00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:54.312
I hope that you're very, very well bundled up though.

00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:57.392
I can imagine how my toes would feel if they feel like they are right now.

00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:06.802
Well, hopefully you had some good snow boots and some mittens and everything on, some big fluffy socks.

00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:08.163
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:08.243 --> 00:28:08.963
FUWAMOCO socks!

00:28:09.184 --> 00:28:11.205
And maybe some goggles too!

00:28:12.305 --> 00:28:14.206
Please make sure to stay warm, okay?

00:28:14.286 --> 00:28:16.307
And be safe as well.

00:28:17.048 --> 00:28:17.488
Thank you.

00:28:17.788 --> 00:28:20.970
Thank you for sending us a little look into your world!

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.450
BAU BAU!

00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:27.248
I think we got another question today.

00:28:27.628 --> 00:28:30.110
Let's check out our Question of the Day!

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.052
We have... De-den!

00:28:33.532 --> 00:28:34.493
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

00:28:34.553 --> 00:28:35.413
Good morning!

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:43.758
I was checking some old, old, old anime songs on YouTube and saw a video with romaji lyrics in it, very nostalgic.

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:46.740
Out of curiosity, here's my question.

00:28:47.361 --> 00:28:53.564
When you perform slash sing JP songs during karaoke, do you use lyrics in romaji format?

00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:56.006
This is actually a very good question.

00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.046
A very good question.

00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.607
Especially since our Rock n' Rawr party is tomorrow!

00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:02.428
Yeah!

00:29:02.508 --> 00:29:04.569
Well, the answer is it really depends.

00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:15.073
Yeah, I guess the most preferred format for us is a video with timed lyrics in Japanese and furigana, which is like little hiragana on top of the complicated kanji.

00:29:15.493 --> 00:29:17.814
Because, you know, it's helpful.

00:29:18.314 --> 00:29:21.555
But a lot of times, we don't get that.

00:29:22.267 --> 00:29:27.969
So we have to go source our own lyrics, and that's where sometimes it gets a bit rough.

00:29:28.209 --> 00:29:29.709
I know.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:41.353
Again, it's most preferred if it's in Japanese, but sometimes you need furigana because for us, we need to be able to know how it's right at a glance, you know, because we're gonna sing it any second, you know?

00:29:41.653 --> 00:29:45.735
But for example, it can get tricky because there's like, ashita, tomorrow, right?

00:29:45.755 --> 00:29:46.615
The kanji for tomorrow.

00:29:47.435 --> 00:29:49.216
It could be ashita or asu.

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:51.318
Same as like iku and yuku.

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:53.620
It's small things but it's important.

00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:17.354
I know it's happened before, but sometimes when we source our lyrics, there are mistakes in them.

00:30:19.055 --> 00:30:23.576
And somebody read the lyrics wrong, or maybe a whole section is gone.

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:29.158
We try to check them over beforehand, but sometimes we run out of time.

00:30:31.033 --> 00:30:32.334
It's tricky, I know it.

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:39.362
We do our best though, but sometimes we have to get a bit resourceful too.

00:30:39.842 --> 00:30:42.005
A lot of preparation.

00:30:42.065 --> 00:30:42.625
That's right.

00:30:43.907 --> 00:30:47.410
It's a lot of preparation that's not actually practicing.

00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:50.654
We know that.

00:30:55.104 --> 00:31:03.393
It can be tricky, but it's fun.

00:31:04.273 --> 00:31:05.975
The brain has to go pretty fast.

00:31:06.015 --> 00:31:06.756
BAU BAU!

00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:11.741
Thank you for the question.

00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:14.584
Thank you Ruffians for your submissions today too.

00:31:19.654 --> 00:31:27.617
Ruffians, we're always looking for more Doggy of the Days for your Pero Sighting, for your walks even though it's cold out, for your questions too!

00:31:27.738 --> 00:31:28.498
Do your best!

00:31:28.518 --> 00:31:34.640
So if anything comes to mind, please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING and let us know, okay?

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.961
Yeah, don't hesitate!

00:31:37.081 --> 00:31:38.622
BAU BAU!

00:31:39.222 --> 00:31:41.103
Now for our next stream!

00:31:41.163 --> 00:31:42.544
We have...

00:31:43.064 --> 00:31:44.445
De-den!

00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:45.766
Tonight!

00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:51.290
We're having a comfy movie night together with all of Advent over on Shiori's channel.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.891
Comfy.

00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:52.491
Comfy.

00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:54.453
Yeah, look at us on the sofa, there's comfy.

00:31:54.593 --> 00:31:55.333
Comfy.

00:31:55.714 --> 00:32:01.938
But this time we're watching her movie pick, which is a movie called The Silence of the Lambs.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.502
I think that it's probably best not to bring snacks.

00:32:09.064 --> 00:32:10.405
Save those for later, okay?

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.332
Yeah, concern for the doggos, thank you!

00:32:15.113 --> 00:32:18.536
I'm not too sure what to expect, but I'm kinda concerned too.

00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:20.998
Every movie is a bit concerned, right?

00:32:21.018 --> 00:32:22.739
A bit concerning.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.644
Yeah, but I'm sure it'll be eventful just like every movie night has been, right?

00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:29.825
Yeah, it's been fun.

00:32:31.386 --> 00:32:33.408
If it's with Abyss, it's definitely fine.

00:32:33.568 --> 00:32:36.129
BAU BAU!

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:41.412
And if we take a peek at our schedule, we have De-den!

00:32:42.272 --> 00:32:46.235
Well, tomorrow we're having another Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:32:46.295 --> 00:32:47.375
This time,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.641
Extra Special!

00:32:50.701 --> 00:32:52.163
Extra Special!

00:32:52.183 --> 00:32:55.627
Ruffians, we haven't announced the theme yet, right?

00:32:55.647 --> 00:32:56.307
We haven't, no.

00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:58.289
So maybe we should?

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:59.270
Oh, yeah.

00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:03.315
Well, Ruffians, you've heard of 2.5D idols, right?

00:33:03.775 --> 00:33:04.276
Have you?

00:33:04.656 --> 00:33:04.997
Why?

00:33:05.057 --> 00:33:05.097
2.5D.

00:33:06.378 --> 00:33:06.578
Wow!

00:33:11.098 --> 00:33:18.983
Actually, this time we're going to be singing Only Love Live at Idolmas!

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.664
BAU BAU!

00:33:20.924 --> 00:33:25.666
The two worlds come together in a perfect idol harmony this time!

00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:27.548
Let's have lots of fun.

00:33:27.628 --> 00:33:29.529
Excited!

00:33:29.849 --> 00:33:37.914
Let's have lots of fun singing all the classics and the hit songs too.

00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:39.554
Make sure you do, okay?

00:33:39.775 --> 00:33:40.175
We're gonna

00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:45.240
Start a happy party train and go my FUWAMOCO!

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.481
Go my way!

00:33:46.822 --> 00:33:50.866

00:33:51.647 --> 00:33:57.793
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us for today's 51st episode!

00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:03.118
Our first FUWAMOCO Morning in December.

00:34:03.238 --> 00:34:03.858
51st.

00:34:04.138 --> 00:34:05.959
I don't know why it still sounds weird, huh?

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:06.639
51st.

00:34:06.719 --> 00:34:17.205
But, Ruffians, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:18.926

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
