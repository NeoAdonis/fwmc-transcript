05:12.650 --> 05:14.550
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:15.888 --> 05:20.242
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:20.262 --> 05:22.807
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:28.826 --> 05:31.668
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:31.788 --> 05:34.049
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:34.089 --> 05:40.313
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:40.333 --> 05:40.953
BAU BAU!

05:41.073 --> 05:46.496
And today, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:47.057 --> 05:47.357
Thank you.

05:47.717 --> 05:49.899
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:50.379 --> 05:51.500
Are you awake now?

05:51.520 --> 05:54.482
I hope the Ruffians awake.

05:55.222 --> 05:55.903
Ruffians!

05:56.363 --> 06:00.306
Thank you for joining us today for our 36th episode!

06:00.646 --> 06:04.449
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

06:07.351 --> 06:09.773
It's a good way to wake up in the morning, right?

06:10.653 --> 06:12.735
Together with FUWAMOCO Morning and

06:13.386 --> 06:14.747
Some air horns?

06:14.947 --> 06:16.568
Air horns?

06:17.268 --> 06:22.351
Well, maybe there's some first-time Ruffians that are a little bit confused.

06:22.551 --> 06:25.173
This explanation might not fix that, but!

06:25.793 --> 06:26.714
FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:26.754 --> 06:32.737
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show, and it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.478
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:34.799 --> 06:38.201
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:38.681 --> 06:40.642
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

06:40.982 --> 06:44.646
I hope you start your day off on the right paw.

06:45.006 --> 06:50.892
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:51.392 --> 06:55.796
Let's all BAU BAU BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.719
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.642
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

07:02.382 --> 07:03.543
Extra silly today?

07:06.101 --> 07:06.702
This is normal.

07:06.842 --> 07:08.844
You should know now, Ruffians, okay?

07:08.884 --> 07:10.806
Don't make fun of Moco-chan, okay?

07:10.826 --> 07:12.668
What did I say?

07:12.688 --> 07:13.149
Did I?

07:13.509 --> 07:14.450
Don't make fun of me!

07:14.470 --> 07:15.752
You saw Pero, right?

07:29.023 --> 07:29.985
Right Ruffians.

07:31.808 --> 07:35.313
Where is he this time?

07:35.333 --> 07:39.880
What is this?

07:41.943 --> 07:44.487
After last time, I guess I could have expected this.

07:45.626 --> 07:46.867
Well, I don't know.

07:47.487 --> 07:52.190
Pero was bothered working hard at the steel shop last time, right, Ruffians?

07:53.410 --> 08:00.114
So, I guess Pero must have gotten pretty tired, pretty exhausted, and felt like he needed a bit of a vacation.

08:00.134 --> 08:00.194
Why?

08:00.374 --> 08:03.336
Just look at him, you know?

08:03.796 --> 08:05.417
He's melting into the sand!

08:06.538 --> 08:08.899
I don't know, Ruffians, you've been working pretty hard.

08:08.919 --> 08:11.181
We've been working hard too.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.622
Why is it that it's Pero who's vacationing, huh?

08:14.863 --> 08:15.123
Right.

08:16.343 --> 08:18.765
Not very fair, it doesn't seem right at all.

08:20.306 --> 08:23.788
But, I guess, on a different note.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.877
Pineapple drink looks pretty nice.

08:27.878 --> 08:30.280
Is it fresh pineapple juice in it?

08:30.300 --> 08:31.761
Or maybe it's something different?

08:32.021 --> 08:32.902
Maybe it's just water?

08:32.922 --> 08:33.742
Just water.

08:34.523 --> 08:34.963
I don't know.

08:35.023 --> 08:38.807
I only thought that these kind of drinks existed in fantasies, right?

08:38.827 --> 08:41.609
Like, they're not real.

08:41.949 --> 08:44.711
We hope you had a really good time on vacation.

08:45.572 --> 08:49.896
Maybe that Pero's lazy attitude didn't get in the way of your fun too much.

08:50.456 --> 08:53.679
You know, maybe it's a good thing that he's melting into the sand here, huh?

08:55.270 --> 08:55.790
That way.

08:56.731 --> 09:00.414
You don't need to see what kind of swimming gear he's wearing.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.597
Swimming gear, pero swimming gear.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.959
I don't wanna see swimsuit pero.

09:07.239 --> 09:07.499
BAU BAU!

09:14.246 --> 09:15.868
I'm not gonna think about it.

09:15.988 --> 09:16.929
It's too early.

09:16.949 --> 09:19.712
It's too early to think about that.

09:19.853 --> 09:22.395
It's never the right time to think about that.

09:22.816 --> 09:24.958
On to happier things!

09:24.978 --> 09:29.404
In case you haven't heard, Ruffians!

09:30.729 --> 09:36.772
On Friday, it's Kobo-senpai's 3D showcase!

09:37.652 --> 09:42.895
Friday at 6am PST or 10 o'clock JST.

09:43.115 --> 09:49.158
Kobo-senpai from Whole ID will be having her 3D showcase final!

09:50.879 --> 09:57.743
I don't know, Ruffians, you definitely know by now, we're really, really, really excited always for all the 3D showcases.

09:58.223 --> 10:03.927
But, I don't know, this time, I just, I can't wait to see what Kobo-senpai has been planning for me.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.131
Right!

10:06.491 --> 10:07.492
Princess Cowboy!

10:07.512 --> 10:13.777
She has such a beautiful singing voice, so maybe we'll hear her for the song!

10:13.837 --> 10:16.199
Maybe she'll play something on guitar!

10:16.760 --> 10:21.724
But, really, I'm just looking forward to seeing her run around and be sort of crazy.

10:21.904 --> 10:22.865
Crazy, yeah.

10:22.985 --> 10:23.325
Crazy.

10:25.206 --> 10:27.407
We're looking forward to it, Ruffians!

10:27.907 --> 10:32.168
I'm sure it'll be a crazy, silly, fun time.

10:32.188 --> 10:34.869
Good luck, Kobosen!

10:35.049 --> 10:37.010
We'll be cheering you on from the comments.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.231
BAU BAU!

10:40.791 --> 10:42.711
Something might happen.

10:42.751 --> 10:45.512
We don't know what might happen.

10:45.572 --> 10:46.132
I have to watch.

10:52.491 --> 10:56.314
And there's been other happy things going on, you know?

10:56.454 --> 11:00.897
And I think maybe Ruffians, um, maybe, you know?

11:00.978 --> 11:03.379
Do you know what it is?

11:03.419 --> 11:06.141
With all the Halloween excitement that's going around, you know?

11:06.161 --> 11:08.203
We're sure you've been busy, Ruffians.

11:09.163 --> 11:13.146
But you haven't been so busy that you missed this.

11:13.366 --> 11:14.087
Why?

11:15.988 --> 11:16.509
Nerissa!

11:16.549 --> 11:20.131
Nerissa, I do cover of Down by the River.

11:20.211 --> 11:20.772
Yeah!

11:21.963 --> 11:23.144
You didn't miss it, right?

11:23.184 --> 11:24.185
You listened right!

11:25.046 --> 11:25.726
You didn't miss it?

11:25.786 --> 11:26.146
Good!

11:26.587 --> 11:27.968
Good, good!

11:28.048 --> 11:38.496
I can trust you. It's a beautiful song for Baldur's Gate 3. And even if you're not too familiar with the game.

11:40.261 --> 11:40.961
I see.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.282
We'll definitely be really charmed by Nerissa's singing voice.

11:45.302 --> 11:47.423
You know, good songs are always good, right?

11:47.503 --> 11:51.984
Yeah, it's quite different from all the other song covers that she's released so far.

11:52.064 --> 11:53.464
It's a bit more of a ballad.

11:53.484 --> 11:57.765
So you should definitely, definitely go have a listen, or have another listen.

11:57.825 --> 11:58.805
Another listen!

11:59.185 --> 12:04.086
And enjoy the gentle and powerful voice of Nerissa.

12:04.186 --> 12:06.387
It's different from us, yet different from her.

12:07.907 --> 12:09.568
It's different from everything so far.

12:09.648 --> 12:11.250
So you need to!

12:11.530 --> 12:12.591
Why, Shurin?

12:12.691 --> 12:13.131
Why?

12:14.012 --> 12:16.053
I don't know.

12:16.334 --> 12:19.776
We both really enjoy it when Nerissa sings in English, too.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.718
It's so pretty.

12:22.859 --> 12:26.742
Nerissa, congrats on the anniversary!

12:27.703 --> 12:31.385
BAU BAU!

12:31.626 --> 12:35.329
We've also had a little bit of exciting stuff ourselves.

12:35.929 --> 12:36.930
Ruffians!

12:38.462 --> 12:41.145
Right before our spooky rock n' rawr party.

12:41.645 --> 12:42.546
You remember, right?

12:42.586 --> 12:44.848
We gave you a bit of a treat.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.311
I hope they remember.

12:47.331 --> 12:51.415
You remember, right?

12:53.977 --> 12:54.678
You forget?

12:54.738 --> 12:55.018
Yup!

12:55.399 --> 12:55.579
Yup!

12:57.168 --> 12:57.388
Cheat?

12:57.448 --> 12:57.748
Yes!

12:58.268 --> 12:59.289
No!

12:59.329 --> 13:01.849
The cheat was... New emotes!

13:01.949 --> 13:04.550
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

13:04.650 --> 13:06.831
BAU BAU!

13:06.851 --> 13:09.192
What do you think of them?

13:10.472 --> 13:10.792
Yeah!

13:10.852 --> 13:13.173
You like them?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.713
You forgot it!

13:15.133 --> 13:17.074
Maybe you should try to remember, huh?

13:17.094 --> 13:21.655
I hope you like our Ruffians.

13:22.096 --> 13:23.376
This time I know we have some

13:23.874 --> 13:25.076
What do you think?

13:33.326 --> 13:34.267
I think it's good.

13:35.508 --> 13:38.170
That first one, what do you mean?

13:39.211 --> 13:42.674
There's also some updates to the previous release of emojis.

13:42.994 --> 13:45.196
So now they're a bit easier to see on YouTube.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.798
In case you didn't know, the BAU BAU one's different, right?

13:48.279 --> 13:56.186
Yeah, YouTube's a bit silly and thinks that we all have 20-20 vision and maybe even some of us who do have 20-20 vision can't see that great.

13:59.141 --> 14:11.266
You know, we have a bit of a stronger vision than you, but even then, we have a bit of a hard time too, so hopefully you'll use them a lot and have a bunch of fun with them now too.

14:11.787 --> 14:14.968
Thank you so much to Meo-pon-san!

14:15.108 --> 14:17.369
Meo-pon-san, arigatou!

14:19.950 --> 14:20.411
Ruffians.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.472
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, huh?

14:22.572 --> 14:24.053
I can't use them.

14:24.974 --> 14:28.276
If you'd like to be able to use them, you'll have to join our membership.

14:28.336 --> 14:30.698
The Doggy Pack!

14:30.818 --> 14:37.523
Actually, right now is a really great time because we're going to be watching The Shining all together tomorrow.

14:38.043 --> 14:46.649
We've never seen it before, so if you haven't seen it before, then maybe we could share the first The Shining all together.

14:48.194 --> 14:50.796
Good timing.

14:51.036 --> 14:51.617
Good timing?

14:51.657 --> 14:51.877
Yeah.

14:52.077 --> 14:52.697
What do you think?

14:53.498 --> 14:53.878
Good.

14:55.379 --> 14:57.421
You know, maybe right now is a good time.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.823
BAU BAU!

14:59.883 --> 15:07.128
Let's have lots of fun with them, okay?

15:08.269 --> 15:12.732
Actually... Ruffians...

15:15.030 --> 15:21.415
It just so happens to seem like there's a little bit of controversy that's come up.

15:23.316 --> 15:28.340
There's been a petition that's been started because of these emotes.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.762
All these new emotes!

15:31.142 --> 15:32.363
We're just doing our best.

15:32.383 --> 15:40.769
You know, some Ruffians seem to think that it's not very fair, huh?

15:42.495 --> 15:43.336
It's not fair.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.717
Not righteous.

15:45.357 --> 15:49.741
That Fuwawa doesn't seem to have her own sneezing emo.

15:52.103 --> 15:55.145
I understand.

15:55.866 --> 15:57.967
But, Ruffians.

16:00.770 --> 16:01.570
Are you outraged?

16:02.531 --> 16:02.891
Are you upset?

16:02.911 --> 16:05.153
I don't know.

16:07.298 --> 16:11.001
Fuwawa doesn't sneeze.

16:11.161 --> 16:12.162
I do sometimes.

16:13.343 --> 16:14.724
Are you okay?

16:15.465 --> 16:17.166
I'm glad that you're okay.

16:17.186 --> 16:25.193
But it does seem like there are a number of Ruffians who aren't so happy, aren't so okay with it.

16:26.574 --> 16:27.575
And they decided.

16:27.975 --> 16:35.422
But they make a very convincing case using factual evidence and research from Stanford University too.

16:36.122 --> 16:39.624
Yeah, it's very well researched and thought out and put together.

16:39.644 --> 16:45.968
But, I thought, you know, if that's the case, well, maybe we should do something.

16:47.229 --> 16:50.150
Ruffians, what do you think?

16:51.191 --> 16:51.791
Should we?

16:52.212 --> 16:57.555
Do you absolutely, desperately need a Fuwawa sneezing emoji?

16:58.837 --> 17:00.118
It's rare occurrence, okay?

17:00.138 --> 17:01.219
It's not like me!

17:01.239 --> 17:06.624
Moco-chan who hogs all the airtime with your sneezes.

17:08.205 --> 17:08.886
Maybe a bit.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.709
Do things always have to be fair?

17:14.211 --> 17:16.132
Yes, they should be fair, but even for imotsu!

17:20.536 --> 17:20.997
Yes!

17:22.487 --> 17:25.010
Where is my position then?

17:25.290 --> 17:30.355
Don't I need a special strange emote then too?

17:33.618 --> 17:35.700
Nobody's thinking about that.

17:37.081 --> 17:38.462
Balance is needed.

17:38.482 --> 17:43.968
It seems like Ruffians have a lot of different ideas for emotes but...

17:44.915 --> 17:48.116
You have to let us know what you'd like to see more of, okay?

17:48.356 --> 17:52.177
BAU BAU!

17:52.397 --> 17:55.397
I guess let us know what you'd like to see for Imotsu too.

17:55.797 --> 18:00.278
Is there a lot of hololive members that cause controversy with their emotes, Moco-chan?

18:00.979 --> 18:01.719
This isn't good.

18:01.779 --> 18:03.539
We're newbies and everything.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.400
I don't know what this means for the future of FUWAMOCO.

18:08.860 --> 18:09.700
It's uneasy.

18:10.601 --> 18:12.101
Could be rocky, could be rough.

18:15.407 --> 18:17.128
We'll do our best, okay Ruffians?

18:17.148 --> 18:18.650
We'll do our best, we'll do our best.

18:21.132 --> 18:22.032
Ruffians!

18:22.272 --> 18:26.876
There's something exciting that we have to show you!

18:27.336 --> 18:28.657
Something special!

18:29.198 --> 18:31.960
Something exciting!

18:35.921 --> 18:38.303
Ruffians!

18:39.003 --> 18:39.784
You should know.

18:39.964 --> 18:41.185
You shouldn't have forgotten.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.848
We have a bunch of spooky plans for Halloween coming up.

18:44.868 --> 18:45.989
You haven't forgotten.

18:46.029 --> 18:46.910
They involve you.

18:46.930 --> 18:48.351
You need to be there.

18:48.391 --> 18:49.252
We told you.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.234
My voice is not dying, thank you.

18:52.775 --> 18:54.016
I am perfectly good.

18:54.376 --> 18:56.798
BAU BAU!

18:56.818 --> 18:57.579
Ruffians!

18:58.628 --> 19:02.849
We thought that it'd be really fun to do something special together.

19:02.909 --> 19:10.472
And that's why we'd like to have a... A spooky story time together with you!

19:10.652 --> 19:12.112
Is that okay?

19:12.292 --> 19:12.993
Is that okay?

19:18.567 --> 19:19.548
Oh well, we have a plan.

19:20.188 --> 19:20.748
Hello!

19:21.349 --> 19:30.274
We'd like to ask you for your own spooky and silly Halloween stories so that we can read them and enjoy some shivers up our spine all together.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.696
Your own original stories that you write, okay?

19:33.736 --> 19:38.138
We'll be collecting them through a simple Google form, so it's nothing complicated.

19:38.458 --> 19:46.563
But we'd like to ask that your stories contain no other characters from other IPs, that they're completely original and are from

19:47.003 --> 19:47.283
What?

19:47.483 --> 19:47.924
Important.

19:48.684 --> 19:49.685
Yeah.

19:49.765 --> 19:49.985
Yeah.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.547
And are from 250 to 1,000 words in length.

19:53.048 --> 19:56.570
And also, that there's no offensive content in it either, okay?

19:56.610 --> 19:57.171
Yeah, yeah.

19:57.351 --> 19:57.991
BAU BAU!

19:58.372 --> 20:01.814
We can read them and enjoy them all together!

20:02.535 --> 20:04.056
Ruffians, are you excited?

20:04.636 --> 20:08.459
Even if you're not, like, you're like, oh, I don't know if I'm good at writing stories.

20:08.779 --> 20:09.460
Please do!

20:09.480 --> 20:10.000
Yeah!

20:10.080 --> 20:13.863
And you know, spooky and silly is perfect, right?

20:13.943 --> 20:14.444
I know it.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.045
Ruffians!

20:17.003 --> 20:20.726
Maybe we'll write our own stories, too!

20:21.186 --> 20:25.330
We should write it with pen names, too, right, Moco-chan?

20:25.370 --> 20:28.072
Yeah, but Ruffians can't tell.

20:28.092 --> 20:32.375
They'll always be like, This bridge line looks like it was written by Moco-chan!

20:34.028 --> 20:35.089
PG-13?

20:35.569 --> 20:36.209
Yes, please.

20:36.449 --> 20:48.295
But Mofi is really looking forward to having more fun together, creating a special first Halloween night spent all together that we'll never forget!

20:48.435 --> 20:51.296
The deadline, the forum is going to be live very shortly.

20:51.336 --> 20:53.317
Very shortly, right after FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

20:53.337 --> 20:59.480
But the deadline is on Monday the 30th at 6pm PT.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.981
At our usual streaming time in the evening.

21:03.482 --> 21:06.124
We hope you have a fun time writing and good luck!

21:06.444 --> 21:10.767
You can find the link on Twitter and in the YouTube description below right after this.

21:10.807 --> 21:13.249
We'll do our best writing stories too, okay?

21:13.309 --> 21:14.650
Let's do it all together.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.832
BAU BAU!

21:18.432 --> 21:19.933
Spooky stories.

21:21.174 --> 21:27.378
We've been doing a lot of kawaii dog training recently, so we should have a good place to start.

21:27.959 --> 21:29.440
Hopefully.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.162
Ruffians, you have ideas already!

21:34.087 --> 21:35.628
Start thinking, okay?

21:36.309 --> 21:39.191
Idea beam!

21:40.092 --> 21:40.712
Didn't work.

21:41.052 --> 21:44.895
I didn't want to sound too strong of a beam, because I want the Ruffians to keep their ideas.

21:45.036 --> 21:46.737
Oh, and you want to keep your own too, huh?

21:46.797 --> 21:48.118
Me too, yeah.

21:51.260 --> 21:51.761
Happiness.

21:52.822 --> 21:53.422
Happiness.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.344
But with the happiness, sometimes there's more...

21:58.851 --> 22:00.012
Confusing news.

22:00.072 --> 22:01.053
Confusing!

22:01.934 --> 22:02.894
Disappointing news.

22:02.975 --> 22:03.995
Disappointing!

22:04.015 --> 22:06.738
Maybe a bit of a misunderstanding.

22:07.779 --> 22:13.023
But this time, Ruffians, Fuwawa didn't cause it.

22:14.745 --> 22:15.986
Yes, they did!

22:16.006 --> 22:21.650
We played five levels with both Fubuki-senpai and Poruru-oneechan, right?

22:21.811 --> 22:22.271
We did.

22:22.511 --> 22:23.872
It was a lot of fun.

22:24.153 --> 22:25.334
We were brave, right?

22:26.468 --> 22:28.529
You're proud, right, Ruffians?

22:29.209 --> 22:32.290
What's that professional mode at the prison?

22:32.770 --> 22:36.592
I died, but... But we guessed it.

22:36.612 --> 22:38.492
We guessed it, and that's the good thing, right?

22:40.674 --> 22:42.455
Well, Ruffians.

22:43.837 --> 22:50.902
You know, we tried really hard, but Fubuki-senpai is really good at Phasmophobia, so I wanted to try and make her proud.

22:51.443 --> 22:53.405
So we did our best to help out.

22:53.445 --> 22:54.285
We helped out, right?

22:54.325 --> 22:58.189
We didn't have too many items, so... But it was a little tricky.

22:58.209 --> 22:59.550
But that's not the point.

23:00.070 --> 23:05.435
You know, we saw that some Ruffians thought that I

23:06.913 --> 23:11.075
I, Mococo, said something embarrassing.

23:12.575 --> 23:13.415
But I didn't!

23:14.136 --> 23:15.956
I never say anything embarrassing.

23:15.996 --> 23:17.057
That's Fuwawa's job.

23:17.477 --> 23:17.877
What?

23:17.937 --> 23:21.138
What do you mean?

23:21.158 --> 23:25.399
I didn't say anything embarrassing, okay?

23:26.960 --> 23:29.001
What did I think you said, Moco-chan?

23:31.021 --> 23:31.682
Ruffians.

23:33.162 --> 23:33.882
I. I.

23:36.095 --> 23:37.175
I don't want to repeat it.

23:38.296 --> 23:43.297
But Moco-chan, if you don't explain it to the Ruffians, then the misunderstanding will never be clear.

23:45.137 --> 23:56.740
So Ruffians thought that I said Fuwawa onee-chan.

23:57.801 --> 23:57.881
But...

23:59.378 --> 24:06.884
What I really said was, Fuwawa wa onee-chan dakara, or that's because Fuwawa is my older sister.

24:07.125 --> 24:09.927
You just didn't hear the wa, because it's Fuwawawawai.

24:10.207 --> 24:11.528
Fuwawawawai.

24:11.969 --> 24:17.153
Yeah, I wasn't calling her affectionately, so don't misunderstand the case.

24:17.173 --> 24:18.994
Could you please call me affectionately?

24:19.094 --> 24:19.235
No!

24:22.366 --> 24:31.532
Wow, ah, but Moco-chan, the one thing that's been kind of bugging me though... Is you okay with how I ported the cassette by porting to onee-chan, right?

24:31.832 --> 24:32.433
It's different.

24:33.273 --> 24:35.755
But, but... It's different, okay!

24:36.515 --> 24:38.657
But you turned down her marriage offer?

24:40.598 --> 24:41.018
Yeah.

24:41.799 --> 24:43.340
She's my older sister now, so...

24:45.563 --> 24:52.351
If she wanted to get married, she should have said something before she became my older sister, so... That was her choice.

24:54.654 --> 24:56.095
You get it now, right, Ruffians?

24:57.037 --> 24:57.577
It's good!

24:57.597 --> 24:59.600
You're not misunderstanding!

25:02.065 --> 25:03.005
No misunderstandings.

25:03.706 --> 25:10.089
I heard you right, and that's why I wasn't super duper happy or anything, so... I'm glad you weren't happy, why?

25:10.789 --> 25:13.931
But you could say FUWAMO-oneechan again, why?

25:14.071 --> 25:14.291
No!

25:14.511 --> 25:16.252
And you say it again on the Ruffians, why?

25:16.332 --> 25:16.472
No!

25:16.492 --> 25:18.053
That's not how it works!

25:18.073 --> 25:20.874
That's not how it works!

25:24.936 --> 25:25.856
I'm not gonna say it.

25:26.757 --> 25:28.738
I'm not disappointed at all, no?

25:33.669 --> 25:35.990
Misunderstanding understood.

25:39.191 --> 25:40.211
Logic is good.

25:41.252 --> 25:43.613
Not confused, you understand now!

25:45.413 --> 25:45.953
Understood.

25:51.395 --> 25:53.616
It is the spooky time of month again.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.937
It's almost the end of it.

25:57.626 --> 26:04.014
And I guess the Ruffians could maybe use a little pick- Oh, a pick-me-up.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.498
I didn't get excited.

26:07.518 --> 26:09.781
Sorry!

26:10.642 --> 26:11.783
I wanted to say something.

26:31.613 --> 26:33.314
Ruffians!

26:35.235 --> 26:36.695
Hello!

26:38.376 --> 26:39.476
It's me!

26:44.878 --> 26:46.979
It's Mococo!

26:49.260 --> 26:51.041
Can you hear me?

26:53.162 --> 26:56.283
Can you hear me from the other side?

26:59.504 --> 27:00.265
I'm here!

27:01.351 --> 27:03.492
To speak directly to you!

27:05.754 --> 27:06.034
Yes!

27:06.894 --> 27:09.836
It's another Mococo Pup Talk!

27:10.757 --> 27:14.179
And this time, you're gonna hear from me!

27:15.099 --> 27:16.100
Mococo!

27:16.120 --> 27:18.822
Spooky!

27:18.842 --> 27:23.144
It's almost time for Halloween!

27:24.245 --> 27:27.707
And you might be feeling a bit of spooky appetite!

27:30.009 --> 27:32.370
Has there been too many scary sights?

27:33.991 --> 27:38.113
Too many decorations giving you a jump in the night?

27:38.133 --> 27:41.994
Has it been too dark for you?

27:42.014 --> 27:45.036
I feel the same.

27:47.137 --> 27:48.838
Core dog training can be tough.

27:50.198 --> 27:51.519
But it's Wednesday!

27:51.539 --> 27:54.640
And Halloween is almost here!

27:55.741 --> 27:58.042
That means spooky training can calm down soon!

27:59.974 --> 28:04.296
But, maybe some treats still await you at the end of the month!

28:05.356 --> 28:06.877
BAU!

28:08.358 --> 28:10.319
You can survive the spooky times!

28:10.339 --> 28:14.040
You're doing great no matter what scares you!

28:14.720 --> 28:21.223
And, maybe, FUWAMOCO will give you some extra treats as well!

28:22.424 --> 28:24.445
Just because you're doing your best!

28:25.765 --> 28:28.506
We will survive all the jump scares we have to go through!

28:29.087 --> 28:29.387
Okay!

28:31.769 --> 28:32.649
BAU!

28:34.230 --> 28:34.970
Did I get you?

28:36.171 --> 28:36.991
Don't worry!

28:37.631 --> 28:40.152
It may be scary, but we're here for you!

28:40.172 --> 28:41.533
Ganbatte da!

28:41.573 --> 28:43.413
BAU BAU!

28:47.595 --> 28:48.816
BAU BAU!

28:48.856 --> 28:50.076
BAU BAU!

28:53.811 --> 28:54.952
Was it spooky?

28:55.052 --> 28:56.013
Spooky.

28:56.033 --> 28:58.934
Spooky pup talk.

28:59.235 --> 29:00.215
Spooky pup talk.

29:00.255 --> 29:00.735
Yeah.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.617
It's definitely been a very spooky month.

29:03.717 --> 29:08.620
Even sometimes going on a walk, I get spooky vibes behind my door.

29:08.900 --> 29:13.023
This is kind of like that game, right?

29:13.783 --> 29:14.023
Next!

29:14.424 --> 29:15.084
Next!

29:15.124 --> 29:15.924
Doggie of the Day.

29:16.325 --> 29:17.085
Not spooky!

29:17.145 --> 29:17.966
Not spooky.

29:18.186 --> 29:21.468
Today, we have a very cute Doggie of the Day.

29:22.794 --> 29:23.294
De-den!

29:24.015 --> 29:27.077
Canelo!

29:27.097 --> 29:30.559
Here she is in a very cute costume.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.681
I should say a very super cool costume.

29:33.701 --> 29:36.843
We love how she loves to talk to you.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.945
She was a wonderful girl.

29:44.208 --> 29:46.989
She's dressed up as a rocker here, but I don't know.

29:47.009 --> 29:52.230
I sort of feel like it looks like she's taking a rock and rawr party to heart!

29:52.450 --> 29:55.170
Because this looks like her daily clothing, you know?

29:55.931 --> 29:56.891
I think it fits her well.

29:56.971 --> 29:57.291
Right?

29:57.311 --> 29:58.791
It fits her that well.

29:58.811 --> 29:59.411
But, you know what?

29:59.971 --> 30:01.552
It sort of reminds me of someone.

30:03.332 --> 30:05.533
Maybe she looks kind of rough.

30:06.553 --> 30:08.113
Kind of tough.

30:08.753 --> 30:09.654
Like me.

30:09.674 --> 30:11.394
Ah, me too.

30:14.673 --> 30:16.693
Very cute!

30:17.233 --> 30:20.854
How does she BAU BAU?

30:21.255 --> 30:27.256
I think, you know, while wearing this cool costume, she has a bit more like a roar to her.

30:27.376 --> 30:27.977
A roar?

30:28.097 --> 30:29.637
A roar to her BAU BAU.

30:30.237 --> 30:31.478
BAU BAU?

30:31.518 --> 30:32.438
BAU BAU!

30:32.458 --> 30:33.478
BAU BAU!

30:33.518 --> 30:34.919
BAU BAU!

30:35.099 --> 30:35.699
BAU BAU.

30:35.839 --> 30:36.699
It sounds like a bike.

30:37.139 --> 30:41.741
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

30:48.125 --> 30:58.611
Although she's no longer in this world with us, we can see just how much she loved you and how gentle and loving and adorable she was.

30:58.952 --> 31:06.236
We're sure she's still watching very closely over you and is looking forward to the next costume you'll have for her too.

31:06.336 --> 31:08.398
BAU BAU!

31:09.318 --> 31:10.720
It's such a beautiful flower.

31:10.740 --> 31:13.182
Oh, there's like a painting even too.

31:13.783 --> 31:15.985
What a cutie.

31:16.465 --> 31:18.027
Well, today's walk.

31:18.467 --> 31:19.729
Did a Ruffian go on a walk?

31:19.769 --> 31:20.990
Ruffians even going on walks?

31:21.030 --> 31:22.111
Even walking, right?

31:22.952 --> 31:23.492
Let's see.

31:24.093 --> 31:24.453
De-den!

31:26.896 --> 31:28.557
It's so orange!

31:28.977 --> 31:31.278
That's a beautiful sunset.

31:31.298 --> 31:39.200
That's the kind of sunset that would make us just keep on walking and walking and walking and walking until the sun is barely visible.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.641
It's too gorgeous.

31:42.021 --> 31:43.181
It's so nice.

31:43.382 --> 31:46.703
I would have to jump out of my seat and go outside.

31:46.983 --> 31:49.123
Especially look at the water too.

31:49.523 --> 31:52.724
I feel like I can almost hear the sounds from the picture.

31:53.085 --> 31:53.385
Right?

31:53.405 --> 31:53.845
It's just like...

31:54.685 --> 31:56.606
So calming, so relaxing.

31:56.646 --> 31:57.527
Need to walk more?

31:57.547 --> 31:58.067
You should!

31:58.287 --> 31:58.867
You should!

31:58.907 --> 32:01.189
You're missing out on this!

32:01.309 --> 32:02.149
It's outside!

32:02.169 --> 32:06.172
I feel like these Ruffians are very lucky.

32:06.192 --> 32:10.214
I'm sure this was such a nice walk after work.

32:10.874 --> 32:13.155
Maybe you felt a little bit refreshed too.

32:13.195 --> 32:14.336
Maybe just a little bit.

32:14.376 --> 32:14.696
BAU BAU!

32:19.646 --> 32:21.447
Well, a Question of the Day.

32:21.487 --> 32:27.853
Ruffians, you still have questions, so we have answers!

32:29.174 --> 32:29.294
De-den!

32:30.535 --> 32:31.296
Question.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.737
Question to FUWAMOCO.

32:33.017 --> 32:36.600
What if FUWAMOCO woke up with switched bodies someday?

32:37.361 --> 32:38.742
What if?

32:38.842 --> 32:39.963
Switching bodies?

32:39.983 --> 32:40.303
What if?

32:41.235 --> 32:43.676
Are you sure you haven't been watching too many movies?

32:44.276 --> 32:44.856
I don't know.

32:44.916 --> 32:46.557
Interesting question.

32:46.837 --> 32:49.498
This isn't really something we've thought about seriously.

32:50.278 --> 32:52.259
Zombie apocalypse is... Yes?

32:52.579 --> 32:54.520
Yes, we've thought about that seriously.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.400
I think the Ruffians know the answer to that.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.121
We know our plan there, but... This?

32:59.301 --> 32:59.981
Our plan!

33:00.002 --> 33:00.782
Yeah, our plan.

33:01.322 --> 33:02.002
I don't know.

33:02.402 --> 33:04.203
Maybe things will just go the same?

33:04.543 --> 33:05.763
The same way?

33:06.844 --> 33:07.424
I don't know.

33:07.824 --> 33:09.805
I mean, we have to wear different clothes, but...

33:10.715 --> 33:16.199
I think probably nothing will really change my... Maybe that's not a good answer though.

33:16.219 --> 33:17.641
Maybe it's a bad answer.

33:18.381 --> 33:19.662
What about you, Ruffians?

33:19.682 --> 33:24.286
Do you have any suggestions?

33:24.726 --> 33:25.907
What do you think we should do?

33:25.927 --> 33:28.469
That's weird thoughts.

33:28.549 --> 33:33.473
I missed you!

33:33.493 --> 33:34.834
Can we try swapping right now?

33:35.354 --> 33:38.076
No, that would be an on-air accident.

33:39.607 --> 33:45.950
That's right, I guess I would sneeze some more.

33:48.430 --> 33:51.972
I guess in that case we definitely need to have a Fuwawa sneezing emo, huh?

33:52.692 --> 33:53.532
Maybe then.

33:53.972 --> 33:56.413
I don't know, I think I just want to go back to normal ASAP.

33:56.754 --> 33:58.854
We have to, we should change our name.

33:58.954 --> 33:59.354
Why?

34:00.035 --> 34:00.475
Why?

34:00.795 --> 34:05.577
Why is it that when you're in my body then we change the name order, huh?

34:07.259 --> 34:08.259
I don't know.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.260
I don't know.

34:10.740 --> 34:11.740
Ruffians, cool it.

34:12.000 --> 34:12.700
I don't know.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.880
I don't know.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.161
I would want to go back ASAP.

34:17.321 --> 34:20.261
Yeah, I feel uncomfortable too.

34:20.801 --> 34:21.221
Yeah.

34:22.702 --> 34:26.782
Why so rough?

34:27.782 --> 34:29.903
I'd be the cherished younger sister.

34:29.923 --> 34:32.923
It's just my body.

34:33.043 --> 34:35.944
I guess my body is a bit younger then.

34:36.064 --> 34:36.364
What?

34:39.154 --> 34:42.056
I had a nice dream, but the Ruffians are being silly.

34:43.758 --> 34:44.618
Nevermind!

34:44.698 --> 34:45.399
Thank you!

34:45.459 --> 34:47.000
I'm sorry!

34:47.181 --> 34:48.322
Do it!

34:49.062 --> 34:53.386
Well, Ruffians, we want to say thank you so much for all your submissions today.

34:53.406 --> 34:56.589
And not just today, always, too.

34:57.169 --> 34:57.630
Remember...

34:58.075 --> 35:03.976
FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together, so we need you to continue sending your submissions!

35:04.076 --> 35:05.657
We need you!

35:07.077 --> 35:07.457
Thank you!

35:07.477 --> 35:11.458
We're always looking and keeping our eyes open for your Doggie of the Day!

35:11.478 --> 35:14.039
I'd like to see what kind of walks you're going on!

35:14.079 --> 35:16.299
I'd like to receive your questions!

35:16.599 --> 35:18.560
And also Pero Sightings too!

35:18.580 --> 35:20.760
Keep your eyes open for Pero, okay?

35:20.800 --> 35:21.721
Yes, yes.

35:21.781 --> 35:22.341
I'll do my best.

35:23.101 --> 35:26.524
Don't forget to use the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

35:26.704 --> 35:28.745
FWMCMORNING, okay?

35:29.746 --> 35:30.367
Hashtag.

35:30.787 --> 35:31.347
Hashtag.

35:31.668 --> 35:32.868
FWMCMORNING.

35:33.449 --> 35:34.290
Hashtag a hashtag?

35:34.350 --> 35:34.750
Yes!

35:35.330 --> 35:37.072
It's a word and then it's a hashtag.

35:37.892 --> 35:38.373
It makes sense.

35:38.833 --> 35:39.994
BAU BAU!

35:40.134 --> 35:41.675
BAU BAU!

35:41.695 --> 35:43.757
At our next stream!

35:44.657 --> 35:45.358
Ah, wow.

35:45.818 --> 35:48.941
Ruffians, today is Wednesday!

35:49.541 --> 35:50.442
Do you know what that means?

35:51.624 --> 35:58.768
Wednesday, it means it's Resident Evil Wednesday!

35:59.188 --> 36:05.932
So, today we'll be playing Resident Evil 4, but it's actually the last Resident Evil Wednesday.

36:06.753 --> 36:09.454
It's a bit sad, but we're gonna have a lot of fun today!

36:09.674 --> 36:12.296
And we're gonna continue, just maybe not so much on Wednesdays.

36:12.336 --> 36:12.676
Yeah.

36:12.896 --> 36:13.116
Fine.

36:16.532 --> 36:20.594
But, we just entered the castle together with Ashi, right?

36:21.214 --> 36:24.176
And our voice are dangerously low, right?

36:24.376 --> 36:25.977
That's Moco-chan, that's your fault.

36:25.997 --> 36:26.897
That's not my issue.

36:26.917 --> 36:27.957
That's Leon's issue.

36:27.997 --> 36:28.758
But hopefully...

36:32.102 --> 36:32.982
It'll be okay.

36:34.023 --> 36:34.743
No problems.

36:35.123 --> 36:35.744
Just issues.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.024
Just issues, yeah.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.425
Let's get Ashley back to safety!

36:39.445 --> 36:42.526
So that she can see her dad again.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.748
I wonder what Ashley's dad looks like.

36:47.386 --> 37:09.308
Let's take another look at our schedule We have a very spooky, spooky and busy weekend before Halloween here We're gonna be playing Devour all together with Avid this week

37:09.385 --> 37:09.825
BAU BAU

37:16.628 --> 37:17.910
They seem pretty scared.

37:18.391 --> 37:19.673
They seem very concerned.

37:19.693 --> 37:21.996
Do you think we'll survive, Ruffians?

37:22.156 --> 37:22.777
I don't know.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.862
This could be our scariest game yet.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.184
You think we'll be okay?

37:28.585 --> 37:30.147
Definitely spooky.

37:30.888 --> 37:32.009
Definitely not scary.

37:32.029 --> 37:32.991
Which one is it?

37:39.468 --> 37:40.610
We'll do our best!

37:41.170 --> 37:44.014
Abbey will be there so we can depend on them, right?

37:45.075 --> 37:50.722
And we'll also be continuing Home Sweet Home together with Biboo on her channel!

37:51.943 --> 37:52.283
BAU BAU!

38:13.502 --> 38:16.143
So, we were doing some testing.

38:16.163 --> 38:19.385
Because we've been very busy.

38:19.425 --> 38:21.266
We haven't been able to play Suica game recently.

38:21.286 --> 38:24.187
No, me sleeping is more important.

38:25.888 --> 38:29.170
I might have done something to Suica game Ruffians.

38:32.131 --> 38:33.071
I paused it though.

38:35.092 --> 38:36.553
Can you guess what I did?

38:36.573 --> 38:39.635
Oh no, oh no.

38:42.581 --> 38:47.564
I... It might be very close to getting a double Suica.

38:48.905 --> 38:49.606
Very close.

38:49.886 --> 38:51.467
I beat my score.

38:52.848 --> 38:54.069
And it's still going.

38:54.089 --> 38:55.510
It's still going.

38:56.310 --> 38:57.491
It was just one test.

38:57.571 --> 38:59.032
It wasn't even multiple rounds.

38:59.052 --> 39:01.934
It was just a, oh, is this still working sort of thing.

39:02.434 --> 39:02.794
Yeah.

39:03.575 --> 39:08.698
So, I paused it so that we could get the double Suica together, okay?

39:08.738 --> 39:08.999
Yeah.

39:10.799 --> 39:12.944
We haven't been playing though.

39:13.465 --> 39:15.910
But we want to do it together, okay?

39:18.677 --> 39:22.699
Please wake up early and let's grow two Suica together, okay?

39:23.299 --> 39:25.640
One Suica can be mine and the other can be yours.

39:26.200 --> 39:26.921
Whatever we need.

39:27.141 --> 39:27.821
Nothing for Moco-chan.
