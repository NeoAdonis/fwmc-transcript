## 🎼 Lyrics

| English (original)                                                | 日本語【翻訳】                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Finally we made it through but not without some tears.            | ついに乗り越えた 涙も流したけど   |
| With the help of friends so true we faced all of our fears.       | 真実の友とともに 恐れを越えたんだ |
| Now we're here to celebrate all that we have done.                | 今ここで祝おう 僕らのすべてを     |
| I can feel it's more than just a game of fate                     | 運命だけじゃない                |
| 'cause our stories have just begun.                               | 物語はまだ始まったばかりだから    |
|                                                                   |                             |
| Hand in hand we're not waiting on tomorrow.                       | 手を繋いで 明日なんて待たない     |
| From now on it's the heart that we will follow.                   | これからは心のまま進もう          |
| We'll move on pass the heartbreak and the sorrow if you           | 君がそばにいるなら              |
| Stay by my side.                                                  | 悲しみも苦しみも越えていけるよ    |
|                                                                   |                             |
| Dancing harmonies feeding the music                               | 踊るハーモニー 音楽に乗せて       |
| as we come alive, and sparks ignite.                              | 生き生きと輝き 火花が弾ける       |
| We're making memories everyday underneath                         | 夏空の下 夜を越えて               |
| the summer sky and through the night.                             | 毎日を思い出にしていこう          |
| We're signing melodies every time we hear music                   | 内から響く音楽に合わせ            |
| from inside as hearts collide.                                    | メロディを歌おう 心が重なるたび   |
| Bringing out the best in each other                               | 互いを輝かせて                    |
| now we're feeling free like were meant to be.                     | 自由になれる これが運命だから     |
|                                                                   |                             |
| Come inside, we'll be there, you can call me day or night.        | ここへおいで 昼でも夜でも         |
| When you need a friend to lean on I'll be there as fast as light. | 君が寄りかかれる友でいたい        |
| Nothing's gonna keep us apart, not even rain or snow              | どんな雨や雪も 僕らを引き離せない |
| 'cause we know that friendships glow and shine so bright          | 友情は明るく輝き                  |
| melting away what we used to know.                                | 過去さえも溶かしていく            |
|                                                                   |                             |
| No matter how many times we end up chasing our tails              | 何度だって空回りしても            |
| things always work out.                                           | 結局うまくいく                    |
| Everything happens for a reason                                   | すべてに意味があるんだ            |
| and it makes us strong at the end.                                | 最後には強くなれる                |
| Yeah!                                                             | そうさ                          |
| I'll be by your side.                                             | いつも君のそばにいるよ            |
|                                                                   |                             |
| Dancing harmonies feeding the music                               | 踊るハーモニー 音楽に乗せて       |
| as we come alive, and sparks ignite.                              | 生き生きと輝き 火花が弾ける       |
| We're making memories everyday underneath                         | 夏空の下 夜を越えて               |
| the summer sky and through the night.                             | 毎日を思い出にしていこう          |
| We're signing melodies every time we hear music                   | 内から響く音楽に合わせ            |
| from inside as hearts collide.                                    | メロディを歌おう 心が重なるたび   |
| Bringing out the best in each other                               | 互いを輝かせて                    |

| Even though there's been ruff times where nobody wanted us,       | つらい時 誰も見てくれない時でも   |
| we kept going, and we kept dreaming,                              | 僕らは進んだ 夢を見続けた         |
| now we are here, we're not alone anymore!                         | 今ここにいる もう独りじゃない     |
| We'll be here together. We have smiles to protect!                | 一緒だよ 守りたい笑顔があるから   |
| C'mon, let's go!                                                  | さぁ 行こう！                     |
|                                                                   |                             |
