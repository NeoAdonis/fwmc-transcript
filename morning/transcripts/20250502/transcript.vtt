00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:08.311
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:12.136
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:14.119
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.367
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:21.008
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.772
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:23.892 --> 00:05:25.194
BAU BAU!

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:30.621
And today we will host a FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:30.801
BAU BAU!

00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:34.766
Ruffians, good morning!

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:41.334
Thank you for joining us today for our 150 second episode!

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:41.654
Are you awake?

00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:42.215
You're awake.

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:50.285
It keeps on getting a bigger number and every time I have to think, how do I say this again?

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:54.350
It's just gonna keep on getting harder from here on out.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.873
You're awake cause of the glasses.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.997
BAU BAU!

00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:03.158
Good morning!

00:06:03.178 --> 00:06:09.847
You know, happy Friday, right before a very fun weekend.

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:20.922
But Ruffians, you know, maybe it's a little bit hard getting out of bed, so we're here to help you with that!

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:24.447
But for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today,

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:30.155
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:32.399
A.K.A.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:32.599
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.844
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:41.592
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:41.572 --> 00:06:43.134
Now, you know the drill, right?

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:45.898
Please tweet and dodge the hashtag!

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.062
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:53.068
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.731
BAU BAU!

00:06:57.494 --> 00:06:59.216
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:01.900
I've seen Ruffians hashtag #on Twitter.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.022
I saw that too.

00:07:03.042 --> 00:07:04.083
I was a bit confused.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:05.505
Why?

00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:07.748
Like, oh, did you make a mistake?

00:07:08.572 --> 00:07:10.636
She doesn't really like it that much.

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:12.920
That's okay though, because I do.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.944
I don't like it!

00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:20.214
I like it so much!

00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:20.394
BAU BAU!

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:20.935
Thank you, Abyss!

00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:23.159
Game for short for morning shows!

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.680
Yes!

00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.664
Short for my Moco-chan!

00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:26.766
Very, very short.

00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:28.068
That means under half an hour.

00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:29.972
Not an hour.

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:31.564
Very short.

00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:32.706
Yes, very short.

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:35.290
Let's get things moving, Moco-chan!

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.650
Okay, okay!

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.691
Exciting news!

00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:37.392
Exciting news!

00:07:37.412 --> 00:07:38.434
Yeah!

00:07:38.454 --> 00:07:38.854
Exciting.

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:39.936
You know.

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:40.577
No, no.

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.560
Nasty.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:49.269
No, I need exciting news.

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:54.997
Go-chan, why are you making that sound, huh?

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:57.901
Go-chan.

00:07:58.141 --> 00:07:58.221
Wow.

00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:12.231
Another Pero sighting!

00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:18.960
It's good to know where Pero is, so that, you know, we can be careful.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.303
It happened again, Ruffians.

00:08:21.323 --> 00:08:21.423
Yeah.

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:24.767
Well, let's take a look at the Pero machine this time.

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:26.790
Let's take a look.

00:08:32.272 --> 00:08:34.474
This is where Pero has been, huh?

00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:40.639
He's been sitting on this poor Ruffian's porch in a box at your front door.

00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:45.304
I don't know, that's a little pitiful, right Moco-chan?

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:47.225
Besides too, look!

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:53.551
Look, he probably used those wings as much as he could to write those letters!

00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:54.311
Really desperate, huh?

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.133
Leave the Ruffian alone, ya!

00:08:56.934 --> 00:08:58.095
I don't know.

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:00.557
What should we do?

00:09:01.837 --> 00:09:02.678
Adopt!

00:09:02.698 --> 00:09:03.279
Adopt!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.962
You want him?

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.645
Wow, that's kind of embarrassing.

00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:09.889
That's some strong wording.

00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:10.830
He's holding a knife!

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:14.135
It's good to always think those things, you know?

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:16.799
I don't see anything, but don't know what's underneath.

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:19.082
He can't even write E properly!

00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:24.570
Yeah... But that also looks sort of funny, huh?

00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:27.624
I don't know, Moco-chan.

00:09:27.664 --> 00:09:33.689
I feel like maybe in this situation, you let him in.

00:09:34.392 --> 00:09:36.079
Give him a pass away!

00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:37.716
Right!

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:43.703
I mean, it's a requirement of finding anything lonely in a cardboard box, right?

00:09:43.723 --> 00:09:44.564
You give it a bath?

00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:45.966
Right!

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:48.049
Huh?

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.509
No.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.251
No.

00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:51.193
Give a bath for him?

00:09:51.693 --> 00:09:52.995
Return the sander.

00:09:54.377 --> 00:09:55.658
Put the sunglasses on.

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:58.161
Close up the sides.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.403
All the tape, packing tape.

00:10:01.846 --> 00:10:03.568
Might as well give him a home.

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:06.596
Even wash him?

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.340
I'm not gonna wash him, but maybe Ruffians.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.523
You could and then you know.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:13.165
Not bad.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.709
Wet demon dog smell.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.011
Go away?

00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:19.174
Maybe.

00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:19.515
Yeah.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:20.836
You're the dog Pero?

00:10:20.857 --> 00:10:20.957
Okay.

00:10:21.457 --> 00:10:22.038
Go play.

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:24.662
But be careful, okay?

00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:46.954
BAU BAU!

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:50.232
But forget that though!

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:53.297
Today is a special day!

00:10:53.337 --> 00:11:05.134
Because today is hololive English -Advent-'s 1,000th Shiori Nobel's birthday!

00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:05.755
Happy birthday Shiori!

00:11:06.517 --> 00:11:08.019
I didn't forget, right?

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:11.524
Very happy birthday Shiori!

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.889
I can't believe it's Shiori's second birthday already.

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:16.311
I can't believe it.

00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:20.737
But a big, big happy birthday to our lovely Chame!

00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:26.445
And this year, this year, Shiori, she's celebrating it with a tea party!

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:27.006
Yeah!

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:28.248
Maybe!

00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:30.110
It's a little mystery, huh?

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:36.980
Yeah, but you know, she's gonna be celebrating it starting at 7pm PT today!

00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:39.624
And you're invited, Ruffians!

00:11:39.644 --> 00:11:41.106
Is that a team song?

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:44.570
Chainsaw?

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.893
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:46.494
What do you mean a chainsaw?

00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:47.517
It's a tea party.

00:11:47.577 --> 00:11:51.286
You bring a chainsaw to a tea party?

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:53.050
Why?

00:11:55.657 --> 00:11:57.401
To cut the cake?

00:11:58.403 --> 00:11:59.466
Maybe.

00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:01.265
Well, you know what?

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:04.391
You'll find out if you join her.

00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:04.952
And you know what?

00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:09.220
Use the hashtag #Partyvella2025!

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.501
Yes!

00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:12.606
Ruffians, you're good at the hashtag, right?

00:12:13.508 --> 00:12:14.690
Right!

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.679
But you know what, Shiori looks like she's gonna have a bunch of fun there.

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:21.623
I never really know what's gonna happen.

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:24.187
Especially the party with Shiori.

00:12:25.689 --> 00:12:28.533
You know, it'll definitely be wild for sure, you know.

00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:31.238
Yeah, mini cheese sofa cake cutting.

00:12:31.258 --> 00:12:34.663
Well, it's up to Shiori, right?

00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:35.925
Yeah, it is her party, you know.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:36.886
I gave Shiori a present.

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:37.687
Not yet.

00:12:38.248 --> 00:12:42.094
Wait, how do I give a Shiori a gift?

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:47.082
That doesn't count.

00:12:47.302 --> 00:12:48.243
No.

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:49.365
I'm not saying that counts.

00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:56.247
But please, please go and say happy birthday to Shiori okay?

00:12:58.851 --> 00:12:59.092
BAU BAU!

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.396
Happy birthday Shiori!

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:04.702
Exciting time.

00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:06.285
I know, so many things going on.

00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:13.918
But one thing we're especially surprised and excited for is...

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:16.742
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:17.884
I'm not kidding!

00:13:18.204 --> 00:13:20.207
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:22.831
I'm not kidding!

00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:23.172
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:24.294
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:25.916
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:28.560
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:28.881
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.161
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:29.441
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:30.142
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:30.162 --> 00:13:30.463
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:30.843
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:31.985
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:32.566
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:33.768
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:33.828 --> 00:13:34.870
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.490
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.851
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:36.131
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:36.532
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:36.953
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:36.973 --> 00:13:37.634
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:37.654 --> 00:13:37.914
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:37.934 --> 00:13:38.215
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:38.555
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:38.855
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:39.236
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:39.617
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:39.637 --> 00:13:39.897
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:40.177
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:40.498
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:40.518 --> 00:13:40.778
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:40.798 --> 00:13:41.119
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:41.399
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:41.680
Ayame-senpai!

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:41.880
Ayame-sen

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:54.322
Ruffians you have to know about it too!

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.728
It's still coming up just a bit.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.173
May 4th at 4am PT.

00:14:00.153 --> 00:14:07.573
So you know, maybe I'll just wake up one morning and Ayame-senpai will look extra extra cute.

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:11.664
We'll have to see what we're looking forward to!

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.549
BAU BAU!

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.356
Can Ayame-senpai get any cuter?

00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:18.799
Uh-oh.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.284
Uh-oh.

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:37.095
Uh-oh.

00:14:37.413 --> 00:14:43.008
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:46.718
We opened its doors!

00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:52.333
It seems to have a few troubles of its own!

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:58.307
Ah, you know, Cafe FUWAMOCO's bad.

00:14:58.327 --> 00:14:58.627
Yes!

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:07.075
You know, last time, there was a few customers that came to be able to, you know, take up the brand new cafe with the newbie maids.

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:11.520
The fluffy, the one inside is a fluffy, fluffy moch.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.781
A strange cafe, no?

00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:16.204
Yeah, the one inside is a fuzzy, Mococo.

00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:17.706
Very normal.

00:15:17.726 --> 00:15:17.826
Yeah.

00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:18.627
Yeah.

00:15:18.647 --> 00:15:19.047
But, well,

00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:24.221
You know, apparently things didn't go so smoothly the very first time.

00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:30.538
It took a little while to come back for another day to open the shop up.

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:34.048
I mean the first day of business they forgot to bill everyone.

00:15:34.028 --> 00:15:39.617
And now, it seems like it's hard to build people as well, huh?

00:15:39.637 --> 00:15:40.479
Yeah, I know.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:52.339
And despite it being a holiday vacation, and having the sign turned on, it looks like the cafe might go bankrupt.

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:52.459
Yeah.

00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:58.168
But there's two very, very wonderful Masters that came.

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:02.798
Mio-goshujin-sama and Watame-goshujin-sama.

00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:08.070
But there's also an order, an order from BAU Eats too.

00:16:08.932 --> 00:16:09.553
But...

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:17.836
I love the time the two maids were seen twiddling their thumbs and sitting down waiting in the cafe.

00:16:19.338 --> 00:16:21.321
They know all the new improvements.

00:16:23.043 --> 00:16:29.652
Maybe didn't make much of a difference in the survival of the cafe, huh?

00:16:30.138 --> 00:16:31.580
We don't believe in the cafe.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.502
You believe that the cafe will survive.

00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:36.005
We'll have to see.

00:16:36.446 --> 00:16:37.687
We'll have to see.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:43.314
No, it's not so easy to run a cafe like cafe FUWAMOCO, maybe.

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:47.519
But one thing's for sure.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.203
It's very cute and a little different.

00:16:51.223 --> 00:16:53.726
Maybe they need to change, huh?

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:56.009
Maybe it's not with the times.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.453
Maybe this cafe is just not fit.

00:17:00.631 --> 00:17:05.999
BAU BAU!

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:13.410
Please check out my FUWAMOCO!

00:17:14.592 --> 00:17:16.555
BAU BAU!

00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:21.002
BAU BAU!

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:29.068
Ruffians, we announced something that we are super happy to share with you!

00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:29.248
Finally!

00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:37.539
A few months ago back in October last year, we hit a big big milestone of 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.723
And so we wanted to celebrate it together with you.

00:17:41.524 --> 00:17:49.555
And to commemorate it, we released FUWAMOCO, our 1 million subscriber celebration merch!

00:17:50.564 --> 00:17:58.353
You know, this merch is very very special because it's something that, you know, FUWAMOCO, we thought of.

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:01.576
We wanted to celebrate it together with you this way.

00:18:01.877 --> 00:18:04.159
We organized it all we saw.

00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:07.263
A lot came from our ideas, you know.

00:18:07.283 --> 00:18:09.465
Like, I want it like this, and I'll have this.

00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:13.229
This would be good to go around thinking, ah, what about this?

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:14.671
Why don't we do this?

00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:15.572
What do the Ruffians do?

00:18:15.772 --> 00:18:18.495
You know, go to the store, take photos and stuff.

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:22.783
We put a lot of love and consideration into it.

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:24.385
It's not like other merch, you know.

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:30.771
You know, this is from us, Chikyuu Ruffians!

00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:33.274
We're really happy to share it.

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.717
There's a bunch of really cool things in it.

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:38.759
Can you take a look?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.145
We have a super cute illustration here from Icomochi-mama!

00:18:44.125 --> 00:19:11.415
I think it looks really cute, but...

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:17.341
And you can also get a very special milestone voice too!

00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:19.663
You can only hear it there, but!

00:19:20.064 --> 00:19:26.991
In the set here, we have a very cute Dreams Come True acrylic diorama stand of both of us!

00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:31.856
Basically, the first diorama acrylic stand of the two of us!

00:19:31.876 --> 00:19:35.660
And not just us, you too, Ruffians!

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.601
Pero too!

00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:39.443
It's very cute!

00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:41.065
Whole family, yeah!

00:19:41.045 --> 00:19:43.507
Everybody's there.

00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:48.312
And next we have a very, very special item.

00:19:48.332 --> 00:19:50.434
We have a pledge of loyalty.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.296
In certificate form here for you to open.

00:19:53.476 --> 00:19:55.218
Yes, you haven't forgotten, right?

00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:58.021
Our pledge from us to yours.

00:19:58.041 --> 00:19:58.301
Right!

00:19:59.022 --> 00:20:03.646
The same one that we made on the Daily Daily.

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:07.930
But now you can have it in your own paws to display.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.292
Throw them before me every day.

00:20:12.196 --> 00:20:21.084
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:42.203
Have a howl of a day!

00:20:42.183 --> 00:20:48.612
But, the thing is with these button badges, you can put them on.

00:20:52.437 --> 00:20:53.078
Together with FUWAMOCO Oshi-Bag!

00:20:53.098 --> 00:20:54.039
Our very first Oshi-Bag!

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:55.241
We worked really hard on it!

00:20:55.842 --> 00:20:58.185
See, there's a lot of different Oshi-Bags out there.

00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:02.451
This is the first FUWAMOCO one, and this one we put a lot of thought into.

00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:05.235
See with this one, it's a big bag!

00:21:05.315 --> 00:21:07.498
Very practical, very...

00:21:08.626 --> 00:21:10.752
Functional.

00:21:11.273 --> 00:21:15.525
There's a black bag inside of it that can actually be removed.

00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:19.336
There's also a very nice FUWAMOCO inner lining there!

00:21:19.757 --> 00:21:23.648
So you can put in between the black bag and then the plastic.

00:21:23.628 --> 00:21:27.795
What kind of plastic clear lining you can put your cam badges in there.

00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:34.726
You can put plushies, headlights, figures, anything you want to, you know, make a bit of a statement.

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.769
It can be casual, it can be more fun.

00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:43.500
There's lots of different ways to be able to show how proud a Ruffian you are.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:51.272
Depending on the situation, you know, if you want to go on your day-to-day or when you're going to a convention or a special event.

00:21:51.995 --> 00:21:56.601
We also have in the set a special voice pack!

00:21:56.621 --> 00:22:02.288
It's a system sound voice pack, you know, so you can use it in your daily life!

00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:04.571
Have you listened yet, Ruffians?

00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:11.639
And it's in English and Japanese too, so I think there's lots of different ways that you can use it.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.543
You can customize it even if you want to.

00:22:14.523 --> 00:22:17.767
If physical merch is difficult, there is this as well.

00:22:17.907 --> 00:22:18.508
It's digital.

00:22:18.628 --> 00:22:22.452
It's digital, you know.

00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:22.572
Yeah.

00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:25.236
The ringtone is super good.

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:25.356
Yeah!

00:22:25.376 --> 00:22:25.556
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.117
Are you having a good life?

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:26.497
Thank you!

00:22:26.757 --> 00:22:29.901
But right now pre-orders are open until June 2nd.

00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:30.382
Yes!

00:22:30.402 --> 00:22:35.087
So we hope that maybe, maybe there could be a discussion with Wallet Club.

00:22:35.608 --> 00:22:36.689
And that you'll check it out.

00:22:36.749 --> 00:22:38.191
If you so feel like it.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:38.912
You can check it out.

00:22:38.932 --> 00:22:42.616
There's a link in the description over on the official hololive shop.

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:44.378
So please check it out.

00:22:44.358 --> 00:22:46.161
In this description.

00:22:47.023 --> 00:22:48.325
BAU BAU!

00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:49.126
Actually, I lied.

00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:51.150
Probably not.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:51.570
Moco-chan!

00:22:52.392 --> 00:22:53.574
I forgot to update it.

00:22:54.355 --> 00:22:55.738
BAU BAU!

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:57.320
Let's update it.

00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:02.890
You can also check it out on Twitter and the community page, Moco-chan.

00:23:06.835 --> 00:23:07.998
BAU BAU.

00:23:09.843 --> 00:23:10.204
Try.

00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:11.748
We'll get there.

00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:12.430
We'll get there.

00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:14.676
I'm trying.

00:23:15.318 --> 00:23:15.800
Yeah.

00:23:16.381 --> 00:23:18.407
Oh, this story tab needs to be updated too.

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:19.630
Can I?

00:23:20.723 --> 00:23:38.884
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:38.864 --> 00:23:42.309
And even more exciting news!

00:23:42.369 --> 00:23:49.999
Today at 5.50pm PT on the official hololive English channel.

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:50.580
A bit of a funny time, huh?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.481
A bit of a funny time.

00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:57.969
There's going to be a very special 3D program for Enryku-chan, did you know?

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.012
Enryku ENigmatic Recollection!

00:24:00.346 --> 00:24:02.168
This is such a cool thumbnail.

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:03.690
Nerissa.

00:24:05.072 --> 00:24:08.496
Iina-senpai, Caroline-senpai, Korone-senpai, Biboo.

00:24:08.516 --> 00:24:09.557
What comes next?

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:13.181
We'll connect all the chains of fate.

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.624
There's a lot of mysteries, a lot of questions.

00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:19.829
And this was gonna happen in this 3D program.

00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:23.053
Apparently there's gonna be... Challenges?

00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:24.294
Challenges.

00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:26.877
I don't know the way they explained it sounded ominous.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.912
Challenges.

00:24:28.932 --> 00:24:32.077
Maybe challenges the challenge the chain of fate.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.160
Who knows?

00:24:34.621 --> 00:24:40.290
Well, for more FUWAMOCOs that are like, okay, what is this ENigmatic Recollection thing?

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:40.530
Yes!

00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:42.694
Well, for sure N-RECORD!

00:24:43.054 --> 00:24:45.619
N-RECORD is a Minecraft roleplay!

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:50.206
Advent that hololive English that we've been doing!

00:24:50.226 --> 00:24:51.167
Yeah, hololive English!

00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:52.730
It's the start of chapter 2!

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.830
Yes!

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.434
You know, we had a bunch of fun Chapter 1 all together with everybody.

00:24:56.714 --> 00:25:02.079
But just because you didn't catch Chapter 1 doesn't mean that you can't follow along for Chapter 2.

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:02.460
Do not worry.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:11.169
You know, if you're curious also what did happen in Chapter 1, you can check out there's a bunch of little summary clip videos about the things that happened in Chapter 1.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:17.535
You know, I would say that that's just to be able to get more hype and record too.

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:18.997
Now recap's right!

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:25.907
But the main event will be starting on Saturday at 7pm PT!

00:25:25.927 --> 00:25:29.111
It's just right around the corner now!

00:25:29.692 --> 00:25:33.657
We hope that you're looking forward to it as much as us Ruffians!

00:25:33.677 --> 00:25:34.879
You'll be there for sure!

00:25:36.982 --> 00:25:37.142
BAU BAU!

00:25:38.924 --> 00:25:39.906
I can't wait.

00:25:40.106 --> 00:25:40.687
Corruption.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.451
Evolution!

00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:46.695
BAU BAU!

00:25:47.485 --> 00:25:57.682
We're gonna take a look to see who's our Doggie of the Day today!

00:25:57.762 --> 00:26:05.515
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Luna!

00:26:05.535 --> 00:26:05.735
Luna-mama!

00:26:05.755 --> 00:26:06.777
Such a sweetie!

00:26:06.797 --> 00:26:07.959
Look at that nose!

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.303
The cheeks!

00:26:10.283 --> 00:26:13.129
This is too cute!

00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:14.472
Pupito guys too!

00:26:15.254 --> 00:26:15.775
Right!

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.167
She's such a pretty color pattern too, right?

00:26:23.032 --> 00:26:24.615
Right!

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:25.297
FUWAMOCO.

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.441
Moc here.

00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:27.702
Moc here.

00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:54.668
How does Luna bow-bow?

00:26:56.926 --> 00:27:01.213
BAU BAU!

00:27:07.282 --> 00:27:08.084
BAU BAU!

00:27:08.164 --> 00:27:08.905
BAU BAU!

00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:12.190
BAU BAU!

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.332
BAU BAU!

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:19.722
You know, we can see from this beautiful photo, she's just such a big sweetie.

00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:21.184
I wanna grow up her cheeks.

00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:21.845
Right.

00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:23.206
You know, her cheeks are big.

00:27:23.226 --> 00:27:24.348
Her nose is big.

00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:32.117
But, I say deep down, there's also a very, very big heart too.

00:27:32.137 --> 00:27:34.140
And you know, I think Luna likes tweets.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.600
Tweets?

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.021
Tweets?

00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.481
Tweets?

00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:37.243
Tweets a lot.

00:27:37.664 --> 00:27:39.987
But more than that, she loves you.

00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:41.749
Not Twitter.

00:27:41.769 --> 00:27:42.690
Not Twitter.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.930
No.

00:27:43.484 --> 00:27:46.068
She's not addicted to toilet, she's addicted to you!

00:27:46.088 --> 00:27:54.443
So you know, make sure you give her lots and lots of hand pats and belly rubs too.

00:27:54.463 --> 00:27:57.248
And that you play with her cheeks too, that's a request from me.

00:27:57.268 --> 00:27:57.829
Yeah, requested.

00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:02.436
BAU BAU!

00:28:02.456 --> 00:28:02.617
BAU BAU!

00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:02.837
Thank you!

00:28:02.857 --> 00:28:05.121
I love you, do you know that?

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:10.446
It'll be a little bit warmer from spring to summer.

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:14.172
Let's take a look at where you've been going for a walk.

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:19.060
The day I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:22.365
Oh, a ski park!

00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:26.332
Such a cool ski park.

00:28:26.352 --> 00:28:28.756
Yeah, and a city!

00:28:29.817 --> 00:28:30.739
And New York City!

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:31.780
New York!

00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:32.121
Dun dun dun dun.

00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:39.970
I was gonna say, did you break any dimensions at the Skateboard Park?

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.731
Yeah.

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:41.212
Yeah?

00:28:41.312 --> 00:28:42.955
Ah, Dokonoko is in New York!

00:28:44.437 --> 00:28:47.561
But you know, hopefully you had a ton of fun.

00:28:48.162 --> 00:28:52.268
That's easily... Yeah.

00:28:52.288 --> 00:28:52.829
Heck yeah.

00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:54.091
You wanna heck yeah?

00:28:55.213 --> 00:29:00.340
HECK YEAH!

00:29:01.382 --> 00:29:01.602
BAU BAU!

00:29:04.332 --> 00:29:06.413
But it looks cool!

00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:07.221
It's very fast!

00:29:09.682 --> 00:29:11.625
BAU BAU!

00:29:13.027 --> 00:29:18.234
We also received a question from you ruffians on our Question of the Day.

00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:20.216
Let's take a look at the question we received.

00:29:20.657 --> 00:29:22.660
We have De-den!

00:29:24.502 --> 00:29:24.742
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:25.063
Hello!

00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:25.844
I have a question.

00:29:25.904 --> 00:29:34.235
Besides playing games, you also have a morning show, FUWAMOCO Morning, a maid cafe, and many other interesting things.

00:29:34.255 --> 00:29:36.178
Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:29:36.158 --> 00:29:40.824
I don't know Japanese, so I wanted to ask if you could do a Japanese lesson!

00:29:41.305 --> 00:29:44.790
This could be very helpful to me and maybe others too!

00:29:47.273 --> 00:29:47.473
BAU BAU!

00:29:47.493 --> 00:29:48.955
Such a good question!

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:49.676
A long time ago.

00:29:50.097 --> 00:29:52.920
Yeah, back when we kinda debuted.

00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:56.826
We did do a Japanese classroom together with Advent.

00:29:57.527 --> 00:29:59.269
We did our best as teachers.

00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:04.256
It was a lot of fun, but our brains also felt like they were about to break.

00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:06.098
Yeah.

00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:12.030
You know, it's hard when there's like a lot of students, not just Abyss, but you too, Ruffians!

00:30:12.591 --> 00:30:17.535
Yeah, and we want to make sure you know that everyone's understanding, having fun.

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:21.178
It's hard with lots of different skill levels, too.

00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:22.339
Yeah!

00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:28.685
But, you know, there's a lot of fun things about the Japanese language and maybe some areas that aren't as hard as you might think.

00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:29.045
Right!

00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:32.268
So, if we could do another classroom, maybe teach you a bit.

00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:33.870
And make us happy!

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.691
I know!

00:30:34.711 --> 00:30:36.372
But, uh, I don't know how to do that one.

00:30:36.352 --> 00:30:39.056
But it has been discussed.

00:30:39.136 --> 00:30:39.496
Yes!

00:30:40.818 --> 00:30:45.524
You want us to teach math?

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:46.065
No.

00:30:46.085 --> 00:30:47.086
Are you sure about that?

00:30:47.106 --> 00:30:47.507
No.

00:30:48.748 --> 00:30:51.813
Do you just see the glasses and think, I want to be taught?

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:57.440
That's maybe it, huh?

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.762
Is that more of it?

00:30:59.463 --> 00:31:00.504
Oh no, please do.

00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:03.188
Oh no, please do.

00:31:03.208 --> 00:31:04.630
You seem to be contradicting, Ruffians.

00:31:05.671 --> 00:31:05.751
Huh?

00:31:06.608 --> 00:31:11.014
I would really like to be able to teach you know, the Ruffians more.

00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:15.560
Advent more too, so... I don't know who the best teacher is though.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:22.148
Yeah, I don't know either, but... BAU BAU!

00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:23.250
Thank you!

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.833
Thank you so much Ruffians for all your submissions!

00:31:25.853 --> 00:31:28.216
The hashtag!

00:31:28.236 --> 00:31:28.737
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:31:28.757 --> 00:31:33.223
You know, sometimes it's kinda nasty to start the day off with a Pero sighting, but

00:31:33.203 --> 00:31:37.649
It's very important, so please let us know if you see Pero around.

00:31:37.749 --> 00:31:40.372
Even if it's maybe in a little bit of a weird place.

00:31:40.392 --> 00:31:46.720
You know, also... If you see a very cute doggy, this is a doggy of a day!

00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:57.154
You know, also, if you have any more questions or you go on a really nice walk, please share them with us with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:31:59.637 --> 00:31:59.797
BAU BAU!

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:00.358
Thank you!

00:32:00.338 --> 00:32:04.885
Ah, well, we have another stream coming up very soon!

00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:08.451
Very, very soon!

00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:09.312
Well... De-den!

00:32:09.332 --> 00:32:14.300
We're starting off our FUWAMOCO Mini-Hurricane Matsuri!

00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:14.581
Yes!

00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.624
It's such a fun game to do!

00:32:16.884 --> 00:32:20.130
And we'll be starting with night delivery to our game!

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.734
It'll be at 9AM JST!

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:26.059
Oh, you know, and we'll also be continuing from there.

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:28.362
I'm on observation duty 1.

00:32:28.842 --> 00:32:31.786
There's a bunch of other games, you know.

00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:33.949
Maybe some Minecraft fishing in the middle.

00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:35.911
Back to it!

00:32:36.892 --> 00:32:38.855
But it'll be definitely very silly.

00:32:38.895 --> 00:32:40.217
Maybe spooky.

00:32:40.617 --> 00:32:41.819
Hopefully not too scary.

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:44.562
And maybe a bit surprising too.

00:32:44.582 --> 00:32:48.587
And we'll be playing a bunch of them past midnight too.

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:51.954
Extra spooky, right?

00:32:51.974 --> 00:32:55.060
Yeah, we hope you're ready for some mischief!

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.244
It's gonna be lots of fun!

00:32:57.264 --> 00:32:58.266
Can't wait.

00:32:58.286 --> 00:33:01.733
We hope you're ready, Ruffians.

00:33:02.152 --> 00:33:09.464
Yeah, it's not howling.

00:33:09.524 --> 00:33:09.584
No.

00:33:09.604 --> 00:33:09.764
BAU BAU!

00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:11.206
And our schedule!

00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:18.658
Well, after our mini-horror game matsuri, and FUWAMOCO's just about to start,

00:33:18.638 --> 00:33:22.303
I'll be having a lot of fun adventures in Aramako.

00:33:22.323 --> 00:33:28.210
But in between there, we're also going to be continuing with Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2!

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:33.036
We just started having a bunch of fun in the jungle being sneaky.

00:33:33.056 --> 00:33:33.477
Very sneaky.

00:33:34.098 --> 00:33:35.099
Very sneaky.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.128
We did not maybe run into a dog the other day in the forest, did we?

00:33:42.148 --> 00:33:43.650
Forget about Rufus, okay?

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:44.953
Keep going.

00:33:44.973 --> 00:33:48.140
But we'll be having a lot more fun days here, Ruffians.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.462
So we hope you enjoy us.

00:33:49.623 --> 00:33:50.004
Enjoy us?

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:51.066
Join us!

00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:52.329
For that as well.

00:33:52.609 --> 00:33:53.711
To have more fun.

00:33:54.714 --> 00:33:55.956
And enjoy time together.

00:33:56.558 --> 00:33:56.738
Yeah.

00:33:56.758 --> 00:33:57.079
Enjoy.
