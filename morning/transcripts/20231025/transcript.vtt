00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.550
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:20.242
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:22.807
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.668
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:34.049
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:40.313
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:40.953
BAU BAU!

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:46.496
And today, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:47.357
Thank you.

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.899
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:51.500
Are you awake now?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.482
I hope the Ruffians awake.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:55.903
Ruffians!

00:05:56.363 --> 00:06:00.306
Thank you for joining us today for our 36th episode!

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:04.449
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:09.773
It's a good way to wake up in the morning, right?

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:12.735
Together with FUWAMOCO Morning and

00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:14.747
Some air horns?

00:06:14.947 --> 00:06:16.568
Air horns?

00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:22.351
Well, maybe there's some first-time Ruffians that are a little bit confused.

00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.173
This explanation might not fix that, but!

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:26.714
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:32.737
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show, and it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:34.478
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.201
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:40.642
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:44.646
I hope you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:50.892
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:55.796
Let's all BAU BAU BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.719
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.642
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:03.543
Extra silly today?

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:06.702
This is normal.

00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:08.844
You should know now, Ruffians, okay?

00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:10.806
Don't make fun of Moco-chan, okay?

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:12.668
What did I say?

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:13.149
Did I?

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.450
Don't make fun of me!

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.752
You saw Pero, right?

00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:29.985
Right Ruffians.

00:07:31.808 --> 00:07:35.313
Where is he this time?

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:39.880
What is this?

00:07:41.943 --> 00:07:44.487
After last time, I guess I could have expected this.

00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:46.867
Well, I don't know.

00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:52.190
Pero was bothered working hard at the steel shop last time, right, Ruffians?

00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:00.114
So, I guess Pero must have gotten pretty tired, pretty exhausted, and felt like he needed a bit of a vacation.

00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:00.194
Why?

00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:03.336
Just look at him, you know?

00:08:03.796 --> 00:08:05.417
He's melting into the sand!

00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:08.899
I don't know, Ruffians, you've been working pretty hard.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:11.181
We've been working hard too.

00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:14.622
Why is it that it's Pero who's vacationing, huh?

00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:15.123
Right.

00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:18.765
Not very fair, it doesn't seem right at all.

00:08:20.306 --> 00:08:23.788
But, I guess, on a different note.

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.877
Pineapple drink looks pretty nice.

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:30.280
Is it fresh pineapple juice in it?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.761
Or maybe it's something different?

00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:32.902
Maybe it's just water?

00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:33.742
Just water.

00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:34.963
I don't know.

00:08:35.023 --> 00:08:38.807
I only thought that these kind of drinks existed in fantasies, right?

00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:41.609
Like, they're not real.

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:44.711
We hope you had a really good time on vacation.

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:49.896
Maybe that Pero's lazy attitude didn't get in the way of your fun too much.

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:53.679
You know, maybe it's a good thing that he's melting into the sand here, huh?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.790
That way.

00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.414
You don't need to see what kind of swimming gear he's wearing.

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.597
Swimming gear, pero swimming gear.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.959
I don't wanna see swimsuit pero.

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:07.499
BAU BAU!

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:15.868
I'm not gonna think about it.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:16.929
It's too early.

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:19.712
It's too early to think about that.

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:22.395
It's never the right time to think about that.

00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:24.958
On to happier things!

00:09:24.978 --> 00:09:29.404
In case you haven't heard, Ruffians!

00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:36.772
On Friday, it's Kobo-senpai's 3D showcase!

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:42.895
Friday at 6am PST or 10 o'clock JST.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:49.158
Kobo-senpai from Whole ID will be having her 3D showcase final!

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:57.743
I don't know, Ruffians, you definitely know by now, we're really, really, really excited always for all the 3D showcases.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:03.927
But, I don't know, this time, I just, I can't wait to see what Kobo-senpai has been planning for me.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.131
Right!

00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:07.492
Princess Cowboy!

00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:13.777
She has such a beautiful singing voice, so maybe we'll hear her for the song!

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:16.199
Maybe she'll play something on guitar!

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.724
But, really, I'm just looking forward to seeing her run around and be sort of crazy.

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:22.865
Crazy, yeah.

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:23.325
Crazy.

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:27.407
We're looking forward to it, Ruffians!

00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:32.168
I'm sure it'll be a crazy, silly, fun time.

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:34.869
Good luck, Kobosen!

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:37.010
We'll be cheering you on from the comments.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.231
BAU BAU!

00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.711
Something might happen.

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:45.512
We don't know what might happen.

00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:46.132
I have to watch.

00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:56.314
And there's been other happy things going on, you know?

00:10:56.454 --> 00:11:00.897
And I think maybe Ruffians, um, maybe, you know?

00:11:00.978 --> 00:11:03.379
Do you know what it is?

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:06.141
With all the Halloween excitement that's going around, you know?

00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:08.203
We're sure you've been busy, Ruffians.

00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:13.146
But you haven't been so busy that you missed this.

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:14.087
Why?

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:16.509
Nerissa!

00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:20.131
Nerissa, I do cover of Down by the River.

00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:20.772
Yeah!

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:23.144
You didn't miss it, right?

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:24.185
You listened right!

00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:25.726
You didn't miss it?

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:26.146
Good!

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:27.968
Good, good!

00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:38.496
I can trust you. It's a beautiful song for Baldur's Gate 3. And even if you're not too familiar with the game.

00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:40.961
I see.

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:45.282
We'll definitely be really charmed by Nerissa's singing voice.

00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:47.423
You know, good songs are always good, right?

00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:51.984
Yeah, it's quite different from all the other song covers that she's released so far.

00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:53.464
It's a bit more of a ballad.

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:57.765
So you should definitely, definitely go have a listen, or have another listen.

00:11:57.825 --> 00:11:58.805
Another listen!

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:04.086
And enjoy the gentle and powerful voice of Nerissa.

00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:06.387
It's different from us, yet different from her.

00:12:07.907 --> 00:12:09.568
It's different from everything so far.

00:12:09.648 --> 00:12:11.250
So you need to!

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.591
Why, Shurin?

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:13.131
Why?

00:12:14.012 --> 00:12:16.053
I don't know.

00:12:16.334 --> 00:12:19.776
We both really enjoy it when Nerissa sings in English, too.

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:21.718
It's so pretty.

00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:26.742
Nerissa, congrats on the anniversary!

00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:31.385
BAU BAU!

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:35.329
We've also had a little bit of exciting stuff ourselves.

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:36.930
Ruffians!

00:12:38.462 --> 00:12:41.145
Right before our spooky rock n' rawr party.

00:12:41.645 --> 00:12:42.546
You remember, right?

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.848
We gave you a bit of a treat.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.311
I hope they remember.

00:12:47.331 --> 00:12:51.415
You remember, right?

00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:54.678
You forget?

00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:55.018
Yup!

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:55.579
Yup!

00:12:57.168 --> 00:12:57.388
Cheat?

00:12:57.448 --> 00:12:57.748
Yes!

00:12:58.268 --> 00:12:59.289
No!

00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:01.849
The cheat was... New emotes!

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.550
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.831
BAU BAU!

00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.192
What do you think of them?

00:13:10.472 --> 00:13:10.792
Yeah!

00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:13.173
You like them?

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.713
You forgot it!

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:17.074
Maybe you should try to remember, huh?

00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:21.655
I hope you like our Ruffians.

00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:23.376
This time I know we have some

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:25.076
What do you think?

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:34.267
I think it's good.

00:13:35.508 --> 00:13:38.170
That first one, what do you mean?

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:42.674
There's also some updates to the previous release of emojis.

00:13:42.994 --> 00:13:45.196
So now they're a bit easier to see on YouTube.

00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:47.798
In case you didn't know, the BAU BAU one's different, right?

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:56.186
Yeah, YouTube's a bit silly and thinks that we all have 20-20 vision and maybe even some of us who do have 20-20 vision can't see that great.

00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:11.266
You know, we have a bit of a stronger vision than you, but even then, we have a bit of a hard time too, so hopefully you'll use them a lot and have a bunch of fun with them now too.

00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:14.968
Thank you so much to Meo-pon-san!

00:14:15.108 --> 00:14:17.369
Meo-pon-san, arigatou!

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.411
Ruffians.

00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:22.472
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, huh?

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:24.053
I can't use them.

00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:28.276
If you'd like to be able to use them, you'll have to join our membership.

00:14:28.336 --> 00:14:30.698
The Doggy Pack!

00:14:30.818 --> 00:14:37.523
Actually, right now is a really great time because we're going to be watching The Shining all together tomorrow.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:46.649
We've never seen it before, so if you haven't seen it before, then maybe we could share the first The Shining all together.

00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:50.796
Good timing.

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:51.617
Good timing?

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:51.877
Yeah.

00:14:52.077 --> 00:14:52.697
What do you think?

00:14:53.498 --> 00:14:53.878
Good.

00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:57.421
You know, maybe right now is a good time.

00:14:57.461 --> 00:14:59.823
BAU BAU!

00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:07.128
Let's have lots of fun with them, okay?

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:12.732
Actually... Ruffians...

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:21.415
It just so happens to seem like there's a little bit of controversy that's come up.

00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:28.340
There's been a petition that's been started because of these emotes.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.762
All these new emotes!

00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:32.363
We're just doing our best.

00:15:32.383 --> 00:15:40.769
You know, some Ruffians seem to think that it's not very fair, huh?

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:43.336
It's not fair.

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:44.717
Not righteous.

00:15:45.357 --> 00:15:49.741
That Fuwawa doesn't seem to have her own sneezing emo.

00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:55.145
I understand.

00:15:55.866 --> 00:15:57.967
But, Ruffians.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.570
Are you outraged?

00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:02.891
Are you upset?

00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:05.153
I don't know.

00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:11.001
Fuwawa doesn't sneeze.

00:16:11.161 --> 00:16:12.162
I do sometimes.

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:14.724
Are you okay?

00:16:15.465 --> 00:16:17.166
I'm glad that you're okay.

00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:25.193
But it does seem like there are a number of Ruffians who aren't so happy, aren't so okay with it.

00:16:26.574 --> 00:16:27.575
And they decided.

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:35.422
But they make a very convincing case using factual evidence and research from Stanford University too.

00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:39.624
Yeah, it's very well researched and thought out and put together.

00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:45.968
But, I thought, you know, if that's the case, well, maybe we should do something.

00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:50.150
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:16:51.191 --> 00:16:51.791
Should we?

00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:57.555
Do you absolutely, desperately need a Fuwawa sneezing emoji?

00:16:58.837 --> 00:17:00.118
It's rare occurrence, okay?

00:17:00.138 --> 00:17:01.219
It's not like me!

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:06.624
Moco-chan who hogs all the airtime with your sneezes.

00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:08.886
Maybe a bit.

00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:12.709
Do things always have to be fair?

00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:16.132
Yes, they should be fair, but even for imotsu!

00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:20.997
Yes!

00:17:22.487 --> 00:17:25.010
Where is my position then?

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:30.355
Don't I need a special strange emote then too?

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.700
Nobody's thinking about that.

00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:38.462
Balance is needed.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:43.968
It seems like Ruffians have a lot of different ideas for emotes but...

00:17:44.915 --> 00:17:48.116
You have to let us know what you'd like to see more of, okay?

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:52.177
BAU BAU!

00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:55.397
I guess let us know what you'd like to see for Imotsu too.

00:17:55.797 --> 00:18:00.278
Is there a lot of hololive members that cause controversy with their emotes, Moco-chan?

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:01.719
This isn't good.

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:03.539
We're newbies and everything.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.400
I don't know what this means for the future of FUWAMOCO.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.700
It's uneasy.

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:12.101
Could be rocky, could be rough.

00:18:15.407 --> 00:18:17.128
We'll do our best, okay Ruffians?

00:18:17.148 --> 00:18:18.650
We'll do our best, we'll do our best.

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:22.032
Ruffians!

00:18:22.272 --> 00:18:26.876
There's something exciting that we have to show you!

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:28.657
Something special!

00:18:29.198 --> 00:18:31.960
Something exciting!

00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:38.303
Ruffians!

00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:39.784
You should know.

00:18:39.964 --> 00:18:41.185
You shouldn't have forgotten.

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:44.848
We have a bunch of spooky plans for Halloween coming up.

00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:45.989
You haven't forgotten.

00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.910
They involve you.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.351
You need to be there.

00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:49.252
We told you.

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.234
My voice is not dying, thank you.

00:18:52.775 --> 00:18:54.016
I am perfectly good.

00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:56.798
BAU BAU!

00:18:56.818 --> 00:18:57.579
Ruffians!

00:18:58.628 --> 00:19:02.849
We thought that it'd be really fun to do something special together.

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:10.472
And that's why we'd like to have a... A spooky story time together with you!

00:19:10.652 --> 00:19:12.112
Is that okay?

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:12.993
Is that okay?

00:19:18.567 --> 00:19:19.548
Oh well, we have a plan.

00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:20.748
Hello!

00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:30.274
We'd like to ask you for your own spooky and silly Halloween stories so that we can read them and enjoy some shivers up our spine all together.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.696
Your own original stories that you write, okay?

00:19:33.736 --> 00:19:38.138
We'll be collecting them through a simple Google form, so it's nothing complicated.

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:46.563
But we'd like to ask that your stories contain no other characters from other IPs, that they're completely original and are from

00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:47.283
What?

00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:47.924
Important.

00:19:48.684 --> 00:19:49.685
Yeah.

00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:49.985
Yeah.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:52.547
And are from 250 to 1,000 words in length.

00:19:53.048 --> 00:19:56.570
And also, that there's no offensive content in it either, okay?

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.171
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:57.351 --> 00:19:57.991
BAU BAU!

00:19:58.372 --> 00:20:01.814
We can read them and enjoy them all together!

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.056
Ruffians, are you excited?

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:08.459
Even if you're not, like, you're like, oh, I don't know if I'm good at writing stories.

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:09.460
Please do!

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah!

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.863
And you know, spooky and silly is perfect, right?

00:20:13.943 --> 00:20:14.444
I know it.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.045
Ruffians!

00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.726
Maybe we'll write our own stories, too!

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:25.330
We should write it with pen names, too, right, Moco-chan?

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.072
Yeah, but Ruffians can't tell.

00:20:28.092 --> 00:20:32.375
They'll always be like, This bridge line looks like it was written by Moco-chan!

00:20:34.028 --> 00:20:35.089
PG-13?

00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:36.209
Yes, please.

00:20:36.449 --> 00:20:48.295
But Mofi is really looking forward to having more fun together, creating a special first Halloween night spent all together that we'll never forget!

00:20:48.435 --> 00:20:51.296
The deadline, the forum is going to be live very shortly.

00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:53.317
Very shortly, right after FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

00:20:53.337 --> 00:20:59.480
But the deadline is on Monday the 30th at 6pm PT.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.981
At our usual streaming time in the evening.

00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:06.124
We hope you have a fun time writing and good luck!

00:21:06.444 --> 00:21:10.767
You can find the link on Twitter and in the YouTube description below right after this.

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:13.249
We'll do our best writing stories too, okay?

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:14.650
Let's do it all together.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.832
BAU BAU!

00:21:18.432 --> 00:21:19.933
Spooky stories.

00:21:21.174 --> 00:21:27.378
We've been doing a lot of kawaii dog training recently, so we should have a good place to start.

00:21:27.959 --> 00:21:29.440
Hopefully.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.162
Ruffians, you have ideas already!

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:35.628
Start thinking, okay?

00:21:36.309 --> 00:21:39.191
Idea beam!

00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:40.712
Didn't work.

00:21:41.052 --> 00:21:44.895
I didn't want to sound too strong of a beam, because I want the Ruffians to keep their ideas.

00:21:45.036 --> 00:21:46.737
Oh, and you want to keep your own too, huh?

00:21:46.797 --> 00:21:48.118
Me too, yeah.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:51.761
Happiness.

00:21:52.822 --> 00:21:53.422
Happiness.

00:21:53.462 --> 00:21:55.344
But with the happiness, sometimes there's more...

00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:00.012
Confusing news.

00:22:00.072 --> 00:22:01.053
Confusing!

00:22:01.934 --> 00:22:02.894
Disappointing news.

00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:03.995
Disappointing!

00:22:04.015 --> 00:22:06.738
Maybe a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:13.023
But this time, Ruffians, Fuwawa didn't cause it.

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:15.986
Yes, they did!

00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:21.650
We played five levels with both Fubuki-senpai and Poruru-oneechan, right?

00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:22.271
We did.

00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:23.872
It was a lot of fun.

00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:25.334
We were brave, right?

00:22:26.468 --> 00:22:28.529
You're proud, right, Ruffians?

00:22:29.209 --> 00:22:32.290
What's that professional mode at the prison?

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.592
I died, but... But we guessed it.

00:22:36.612 --> 00:22:38.492
We guessed it, and that's the good thing, right?

00:22:40.674 --> 00:22:42.455
Well, Ruffians.

00:22:43.837 --> 00:22:50.902
You know, we tried really hard, but Fubuki-senpai is really good at Phasmophobia, so I wanted to try and make her proud.

00:22:51.443 --> 00:22:53.405
So we did our best to help out.

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:54.285
We helped out, right?

00:22:54.325 --> 00:22:58.189
We didn't have too many items, so... But it was a little tricky.

00:22:58.209 --> 00:22:59.550
But that's not the point.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:05.435
You know, we saw that some Ruffians thought that I

00:23:06.913 --> 00:23:11.075
I, Mococo, said something embarrassing.

00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:13.415
But I didn't!

00:23:14.136 --> 00:23:15.956
I never say anything embarrassing.

00:23:15.996 --> 00:23:17.057
That's Fuwawa's job.

00:23:17.477 --> 00:23:17.877
What?

00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:21.138
What do you mean?

00:23:21.158 --> 00:23:25.399
I didn't say anything embarrassing, okay?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.001
What did I think you said, Moco-chan?

00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:31.682
Ruffians.

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:33.882
I. I.

00:23:36.095 --> 00:23:37.175
I don't want to repeat it.

00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:43.297
But Moco-chan, if you don't explain it to the Ruffians, then the misunderstanding will never be clear.

00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:56.740
So Ruffians thought that I said Fuwawa onee-chan.

00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:57.881
But...

00:23:59.378 --> 00:24:06.884
What I really said was, Fuwawa wa onee-chan dakara, or that's because Fuwawa is my older sister.

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:09.927
You just didn't hear the wa, because it's Fuwawawawai.

00:24:10.207 --> 00:24:11.528
Fuwawawawai.

00:24:11.969 --> 00:24:17.153
Yeah, I wasn't calling her affectionately, so don't misunderstand the case.

00:24:17.173 --> 00:24:18.994
Could you please call me affectionately?

00:24:19.094 --> 00:24:19.235
No!

00:24:22.366 --> 00:24:31.532
Wow, ah, but Moco-chan, the one thing that's been kind of bugging me though... Is you okay with how I ported the cassette by porting to onee-chan, right?

00:24:31.832 --> 00:24:32.433
It's different.

00:24:33.273 --> 00:24:35.755
But, but... It's different, okay!

00:24:36.515 --> 00:24:38.657
But you turned down her marriage offer?

00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:41.018
Yeah.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:43.340
She's my older sister now, so...

00:24:45.563 --> 00:24:52.351
If she wanted to get married, she should have said something before she became my older sister, so... That was her choice.

00:24:54.654 --> 00:24:56.095
You get it now, right, Ruffians?

00:24:57.037 --> 00:24:57.577
It's good!

00:24:57.597 --> 00:24:59.600
You're not misunderstanding!

00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.005
No misunderstandings.

00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:10.089
I heard you right, and that's why I wasn't super duper happy or anything, so... I'm glad you weren't happy, why?

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:13.931
But you could say FUWAMO-oneechan again, why?

00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:14.291
No!

00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.252
And you say it again on the Ruffians, why?

00:25:16.332 --> 00:25:16.472
No!

00:25:16.492 --> 00:25:18.053
That's not how it works!

00:25:18.073 --> 00:25:20.874
That's not how it works!

00:25:24.936 --> 00:25:25.856
I'm not gonna say it.

00:25:26.757 --> 00:25:28.738
I'm not disappointed at all, no?

00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:35.990
Misunderstanding understood.

00:25:39.191 --> 00:25:40.211
Logic is good.

00:25:41.252 --> 00:25:43.613
Not confused, you understand now!

00:25:45.413 --> 00:25:45.953
Understood.

00:25:51.395 --> 00:25:53.616
It is the spooky time of month again.

00:25:53.636 --> 00:25:55.937
It's almost the end of it.

00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:04.014
And I guess the Ruffians could maybe use a little pick- Oh, a pick-me-up.

00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.498
I didn't get excited.

00:26:07.518 --> 00:26:09.781
Sorry!

00:26:10.642 --> 00:26:11.783
I wanted to say something.

00:26:31.613 --> 00:26:33.314
Ruffians!

00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:36.695
Hello!

00:26:38.376 --> 00:26:39.476
It's me!

00:26:44.878 --> 00:26:46.979
It's Mococo!

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.041
Can you hear me?

00:26:53.162 --> 00:26:56.283
Can you hear me from the other side?

00:26:59.504 --> 00:27:00.265
I'm here!

00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:03.492
To speak directly to you!

00:27:05.754 --> 00:27:06.034
Yes!

00:27:06.894 --> 00:27:09.836
It's another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:10.757 --> 00:27:14.179
And this time, you're gonna hear from me!

00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:16.100
Mococo!

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.822
Spooky!

00:27:18.842 --> 00:27:23.144
It's almost time for Halloween!

00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:27.707
And you might be feeling a bit of spooky appetite!

00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:32.370
Has there been too many scary sights?

00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:38.113
Too many decorations giving you a jump in the night?

00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:41.994
Has it been too dark for you?

00:27:42.014 --> 00:27:45.036
I feel the same.

00:27:47.137 --> 00:27:48.838
Core dog training can be tough.

00:27:50.198 --> 00:27:51.519
But it's Wednesday!

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.640
And Halloween is almost here!

00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:58.042
That means spooky training can calm down soon!

00:27:59.974 --> 00:28:04.296
But, maybe some treats still await you at the end of the month!

00:28:05.356 --> 00:28:06.877
BAU!

00:28:08.358 --> 00:28:10.319
You can survive the spooky times!

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:14.040
You're doing great no matter what scares you!

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.223
And, maybe, FUWAMOCO will give you some extra treats as well!

00:28:22.424 --> 00:28:24.445
Just because you're doing your best!

00:28:25.765 --> 00:28:28.506
We will survive all the jump scares we have to go through!

00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:29.387
Okay!

00:28:31.769 --> 00:28:32.649
BAU!

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.970
Did I get you?

00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:36.991
Don't worry!

00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:40.152
It may be scary, but we're here for you!

00:28:40.172 --> 00:28:41.533
Ganbatte da!

00:28:41.573 --> 00:28:43.413
BAU BAU!

00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:48.816
BAU BAU!

00:28:48.856 --> 00:28:50.076
BAU BAU!

00:28:53.811 --> 00:28:54.952
Was it spooky?

00:28:55.052 --> 00:28:56.013
Spooky.

00:28:56.033 --> 00:28:58.934
Spooky pup talk.

00:28:59.235 --> 00:29:00.215
Spooky pup talk.

00:29:00.255 --> 00:29:00.735
Yeah.

00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:03.617
It's definitely been a very spooky month.

00:29:03.717 --> 00:29:08.620
Even sometimes going on a walk, I get spooky vibes behind my door.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.023
This is kind of like that game, right?

00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:14.023
Next!

00:29:14.424 --> 00:29:15.084
Next!

00:29:15.124 --> 00:29:15.924
Doggie of the Day.

00:29:16.325 --> 00:29:17.085
Not spooky!

00:29:17.145 --> 00:29:17.966
Not spooky.

00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:21.468
Today, we have a very cute Doggie of the Day.

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:23.294
De-den!

00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:27.077
Canelo!

00:29:27.097 --> 00:29:30.559
Here she is in a very cute costume.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.681
I should say a very super cool costume.

00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:36.843
We love how she loves to talk to you.

00:29:36.983 --> 00:29:38.945
She was a wonderful girl.

00:29:44.208 --> 00:29:46.989
She's dressed up as a rocker here, but I don't know.

00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:52.230
I sort of feel like it looks like she's taking a rock and rawr party to heart!

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.170
Because this looks like her daily clothing, you know?

00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:56.891
I think it fits her well.

00:29:56.971 --> 00:29:57.291
Right?

00:29:57.311 --> 00:29:58.791
It fits her that well.

00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.411
But, you know what?

00:29:59.971 --> 00:30:01.552
It sort of reminds me of someone.

00:30:03.332 --> 00:30:05.533
Maybe she looks kind of rough.

00:30:06.553 --> 00:30:08.113
Kind of tough.

00:30:08.753 --> 00:30:09.654
Like me.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.394
Ah, me too.

00:30:14.673 --> 00:30:16.693
Very cute!

00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:20.854
How does she BAU BAU?

00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:27.256
I think, you know, while wearing this cool costume, she has a bit more like a roar to her.

00:30:27.376 --> 00:30:27.977
A roar?

00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:29.637
A roar to her BAU BAU.

00:30:30.237 --> 00:30:31.478
BAU BAU?

00:30:31.518 --> 00:30:32.438
BAU BAU!

00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:33.478
BAU BAU!

00:30:33.518 --> 00:30:34.919
BAU BAU!

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:35.699
BAU BAU.

00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:36.699
It sounds like a bike.

00:30:37.139 --> 00:30:41.741
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:58.611
Although she's no longer in this world with us, we can see just how much she loved you and how gentle and loving and adorable she was.

00:30:58.952 --> 00:31:06.236
We're sure she's still watching very closely over you and is looking forward to the next costume you'll have for her too.

00:31:06.336 --> 00:31:08.398
BAU BAU!

00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:10.720
It's such a beautiful flower.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.182
Oh, there's like a painting even too.

00:31:13.783 --> 00:31:15.985
What a cutie.

00:31:16.465 --> 00:31:18.027
Well, today's walk.

00:31:18.467 --> 00:31:19.729
Did a Ruffian go on a walk?

00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:20.990
Ruffians even going on walks?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.111
Even walking, right?

00:31:22.952 --> 00:31:23.492
Let's see.

00:31:24.093 --> 00:31:24.453
De-den!

00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:28.557
It's so orange!

00:31:28.977 --> 00:31:31.278
That's a beautiful sunset.

00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:39.200
That's the kind of sunset that would make us just keep on walking and walking and walking and walking until the sun is barely visible.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.641
It's too gorgeous.

00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:43.181
It's so nice.

00:31:43.382 --> 00:31:46.703
I would have to jump out of my seat and go outside.

00:31:46.983 --> 00:31:49.123
Especially look at the water too.

00:31:49.523 --> 00:31:52.724
I feel like I can almost hear the sounds from the picture.

00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:53.385
Right?

00:31:53.405 --> 00:31:53.845
It's just like...

00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:56.606
So calming, so relaxing.

00:31:56.646 --> 00:31:57.527
Need to walk more?

00:31:57.547 --> 00:31:58.067
You should!

00:31:58.287 --> 00:31:58.867
You should!

00:31:58.907 --> 00:32:01.189
You're missing out on this!

00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:02.149
It's outside!

00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:06.172
I feel like these Ruffians are very lucky.

00:32:06.192 --> 00:32:10.214
I'm sure this was such a nice walk after work.

00:32:10.874 --> 00:32:13.155
Maybe you felt a little bit refreshed too.

00:32:13.195 --> 00:32:14.336
Maybe just a little bit.

00:32:14.376 --> 00:32:14.696
BAU BAU!

00:32:19.646 --> 00:32:21.447
Well, a Question of the Day.

00:32:21.487 --> 00:32:27.853
Ruffians, you still have questions, so we have answers!

00:32:29.174 --> 00:32:29.294
De-den!

00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:31.296
Question.

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.737
Question to FUWAMOCO.

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:36.600
What if FUWAMOCO woke up with switched bodies someday?

00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:38.742
What if?

00:32:38.842 --> 00:32:39.963
Switching bodies?

00:32:39.983 --> 00:32:40.303
What if?

00:32:41.235 --> 00:32:43.676
Are you sure you haven't been watching too many movies?

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:44.856
I don't know.

00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:46.557
Interesting question.

00:32:46.837 --> 00:32:49.498
This isn't really something we've thought about seriously.

00:32:50.278 --> 00:32:52.259
Zombie apocalypse is... Yes?

00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:54.520
Yes, we've thought about that seriously.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.400
I think the Ruffians know the answer to that.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.121
We know our plan there, but... This?

00:32:59.301 --> 00:32:59.981
Our plan!

00:33:00.002 --> 00:33:00.782
Yeah, our plan.

00:33:01.322 --> 00:33:02.002
I don't know.

00:33:02.402 --> 00:33:04.203
Maybe things will just go the same?

00:33:04.543 --> 00:33:05.763
The same way?

00:33:06.844 --> 00:33:07.424
I don't know.

00:33:07.824 --> 00:33:09.805
I mean, we have to wear different clothes, but...

00:33:10.715 --> 00:33:16.199
I think probably nothing will really change my... Maybe that's not a good answer though.

00:33:16.219 --> 00:33:17.641
Maybe it's a bad answer.

00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:19.662
What about you, Ruffians?

00:33:19.682 --> 00:33:24.286
Do you have any suggestions?

00:33:24.726 --> 00:33:25.907
What do you think we should do?

00:33:25.927 --> 00:33:28.469
That's weird thoughts.

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:33.473
I missed you!

00:33:33.493 --> 00:33:34.834
Can we try swapping right now?

00:33:35.354 --> 00:33:38.076
No, that would be an on-air accident.

00:33:39.607 --> 00:33:45.950
That's right, I guess I would sneeze some more.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.972
I guess in that case we definitely need to have a Fuwawa sneezing emo, huh?

00:33:52.692 --> 00:33:53.532
Maybe then.

00:33:53.972 --> 00:33:56.413
I don't know, I think I just want to go back to normal ASAP.

00:33:56.754 --> 00:33:58.854
We have to, we should change our name.

00:33:58.954 --> 00:33:59.354
Why?

00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:00.475
Why?

00:34:00.795 --> 00:34:05.577
Why is it that when you're in my body then we change the name order, huh?

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:08.259
I don't know.

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.260
I don't know.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.740
Ruffians, cool it.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.700
I don't know.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.880
I don't know.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.161
I would want to go back ASAP.

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:20.261
Yeah, I feel uncomfortable too.

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:21.221
Yeah.

00:34:22.702 --> 00:34:26.782
Why so rough?

00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:29.903
I'd be the cherished younger sister.

00:34:29.923 --> 00:34:32.923
It's just my body.

00:34:33.043 --> 00:34:35.944
I guess my body is a bit younger then.

00:34:36.064 --> 00:34:36.364
What?

00:34:39.154 --> 00:34:42.056
I had a nice dream, but the Ruffians are being silly.

00:34:43.758 --> 00:34:44.618
Nevermind!

00:34:44.698 --> 00:34:45.399
Thank you!

00:34:45.459 --> 00:34:47.000
I'm sorry!

00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:48.322
Do it!

00:34:49.062 --> 00:34:53.386
Well, Ruffians, we want to say thank you so much for all your submissions today.

00:34:53.406 --> 00:34:56.589
And not just today, always, too.

00:34:57.169 --> 00:34:57.630
Remember...

00:34:58.075 --> 00:35:03.976
FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together, so we need you to continue sending your submissions!

00:35:04.076 --> 00:35:05.657
We need you!

00:35:07.077 --> 00:35:07.457
Thank you!

00:35:07.477 --> 00:35:11.458
We're always looking and keeping our eyes open for your Doggie of the Day!

00:35:11.478 --> 00:35:14.039
I'd like to see what kind of walks you're going on!

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.299
I'd like to receive your questions!

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.560
And also Pero Sightings too!

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.760
Keep your eyes open for Pero, okay?

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.721
Yes, yes.

00:35:21.781 --> 00:35:22.341
I'll do my best.

00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:26.524
Don't forget to use the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:35:26.704 --> 00:35:28.745
FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:35:29.746 --> 00:35:30.367
Hashtag.

00:35:30.787 --> 00:35:31.347
Hashtag.

00:35:31.668 --> 00:35:32.868
FWMCMORNING.

00:35:33.449 --> 00:35:34.290
Hashtag a hashtag?

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:34.750
Yes!

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.072
It's a word and then it's a hashtag.

00:35:37.892 --> 00:35:38.373
It makes sense.

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:39.994
BAU BAU!

00:35:40.134 --> 00:35:41.675
BAU BAU!

00:35:41.695 --> 00:35:43.757
At our next stream!

00:35:44.657 --> 00:35:45.358
Ah, wow.

00:35:45.818 --> 00:35:48.941
Ruffians, today is Wednesday!

00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:50.442
Do you know what that means?

00:35:51.624 --> 00:35:58.768
Wednesday, it means it's Resident Evil Wednesday!

00:35:59.188 --> 00:36:05.932
So, today we'll be playing Resident Evil 4, but it's actually the last Resident Evil Wednesday.

00:36:06.753 --> 00:36:09.454
It's a bit sad, but we're gonna have a lot of fun today!

00:36:09.674 --> 00:36:12.296
And we're gonna continue, just maybe not so much on Wednesdays.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:12.676
Yeah.

00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:13.116
Fine.

00:36:16.532 --> 00:36:20.594
But, we just entered the castle together with Ashi, right?

00:36:21.214 --> 00:36:24.176
And our voice are dangerously low, right?

00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:25.977
That's Moco-chan, that's your fault.

00:36:25.997 --> 00:36:26.897
That's not my issue.

00:36:26.917 --> 00:36:27.957
That's Leon's issue.

00:36:27.997 --> 00:36:28.758
But hopefully...

00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:32.982
It'll be okay.

00:36:34.023 --> 00:36:34.743
No problems.

00:36:35.123 --> 00:36:35.744
Just issues.

00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.024
Just issues, yeah.

00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:39.425
Let's get Ashley back to safety!

00:36:39.445 --> 00:36:42.526
So that she can see her dad again.

00:36:43.327 --> 00:36:45.748
I wonder what Ashley's dad looks like.

00:36:47.386 --> 00:37:09.308
Let's take another look at our schedule We have a very spooky, spooky and busy weekend before Halloween here We're gonna be playing Devour all together with Avid this week

00:37:09.385 --> 00:37:09.825
BAU BAU

00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:17.910
They seem pretty scared.

00:37:18.391 --> 00:37:19.673
They seem very concerned.

00:37:19.693 --> 00:37:21.996
Do you think we'll survive, Ruffians?

00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:22.777
I don't know.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.862
This could be our scariest game yet.

00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:28.184
You think we'll be okay?

00:37:28.585 --> 00:37:30.147
Definitely spooky.

00:37:30.888 --> 00:37:32.009
Definitely not scary.

00:37:32.029 --> 00:37:32.991
Which one is it?

00:37:39.468 --> 00:37:40.610
We'll do our best!

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.014
Abbey will be there so we can depend on them, right?

00:37:45.075 --> 00:37:50.722
And we'll also be continuing Home Sweet Home together with Biboo on her channel!

00:37:51.943 --> 00:37:52.283
BAU BAU!

00:38:13.502 --> 00:38:16.143
So, we were doing some testing.

00:38:16.163 --> 00:38:19.385
Because we've been very busy.

00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:21.266
We haven't been able to play Suica game recently.

00:38:21.286 --> 00:38:24.187
No, me sleeping is more important.

00:38:25.888 --> 00:38:29.170
I might have done something to Suica game Ruffians.

00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:33.071
I paused it though.

00:38:35.092 --> 00:38:36.553
Can you guess what I did?

00:38:36.573 --> 00:38:39.635
Oh no, oh no.

00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:47.564
I... It might be very close to getting a double Suica.

00:38:48.905 --> 00:38:49.606
Very close.

00:38:49.886 --> 00:38:51.467
I beat my score.

00:38:52.848 --> 00:38:54.069
And it's still going.

00:38:54.089 --> 00:38:55.510
It's still going.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.491
It was just one test.

00:38:57.571 --> 00:38:59.032
It wasn't even multiple rounds.

00:38:59.052 --> 00:39:01.934
It was just a, oh, is this still working sort of thing.

00:39:02.434 --> 00:39:02.794
Yeah.

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:08.698
So, I paused it so that we could get the double Suica together, okay?

00:39:08.738 --> 00:39:08.999
Yeah.

00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:12.944
We haven't been playing though.

00:39:13.465 --> 00:39:15.910
But we want to do it together, okay?

00:39:18.677 --> 00:39:22.699
Please wake up early and let's grow two Suica together, okay?

00:39:23.299 --> 00:39:25.640
One Suica can be mine and the other can be yours.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.921
Whatever we need.

00:39:27.141 --> 00:39:27.821
Nothing for Moco-chan.

00:39:28.501 --> 00:39:30.242

00:39:30.262 --> 00:39:41.046
