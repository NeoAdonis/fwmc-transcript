## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (06:44)

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/Ginko_02/status/1700227442798195182) found Pero sitting on a bench, just to disappear shortly afterwards. FUWAMOCO don't seem very concerned about that…

## Council 3D Showcase (08:55)

FUWAMOCO celebrate their senpai's upcoming [3D showcase](https://twitter.com/hololive_En/status/1701430450273837276). Will you join them?

## RIP Vacuum (10:24)

There was a tragedy during their last tidy-up Twitter Space, and FUWAMOCO's aging vacuum is no more. Mococo shares a pic of Vac-kun along with some memories with them.

## Misunderstanding (12:51)

Mococo is bewildered that [her drawing of Ina](https://youtu.be/8w8utBUJwEY?&t=479) was misunderstood as something else, blaming Ruffians for not using their eyes and brain…

## FWMC and Punctuality (17:39)

FUWAMOCO tell us about their motivation for being on time for their streams.

## Doggie of the Day (22:44)

Today's doggie is [Lucaan](https://twitter.com/Lucaan0102/status/1702026579524702481)'s Aspen! This cute doggo is taking some sun while sleeping.

## Today I Went On A Walk (25:05)

While taking a walk, [Zhoxn Q](https://twitter.com/ZhoxnQ/status/1701311965409276033) found an interesting pair of bananas that reminded them to some certain twin sisters and [their latest adventures in the jungle](https://youtu.be/ndNZ1ClWZ6g)…

## Question Of The Day (27:18)

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/ArcLL_Maru/status/1700995081074057220) asks FUWAMOCO-sensei for material recommendations to study Japanese. They recommended to start with the [Genki textbooks](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/intro/), not overwhelming yourself with kanji studies just when you're starting, and being OK with making mistakes; that's just part of learning. 日本語を勉強しているラッフィアンの皆さん、頑張ってね！
