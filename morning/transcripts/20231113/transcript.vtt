05:22.410 --> 05:25.560
Hello, hello, BAU BAU...

05:25.950 --> 05:25.553
It's time... What time was it?

05:37.315 --> 05:40.888
FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:40.910  --> 05:45.635
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru... yo ne? 

05:47.776 --> 05:48.897
BAU BAU!

05:49.497 --> 05:50.438
All right!

05:50.658 --> 05:51.298
BAU.

06:03.975 --> 06:07.250
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

06:14.645 --> 06:15.933
I'm Mococo.

06:18.234 --> 06:19.795
Together... we're... FUWAMOCO!

06:20.355 --> 06:43.148

06:43.706 --> 06:44.166
I guess.

06:44.727 --> 06:45.107
Yeah.

06:46.148 --> 06:50.572
Thank you for joining us for our 43rd episode.

06:50.692 --> 06:50.812
43rd.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.634
43rd episode.

06:53.994 --> 06:56.757
I'm sleepy!

06:58.078 --> 07:00.580
No, my eyes aren't even properly open.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.581
They're all swollen.

07:01.601 --> 07:03.582
Can I just go back to bed?

07:03.862 --> 07:07.886
No, I never went to bed, but I woke up on the wrong side of the pub.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.668
Abyss, you don't lie, right?

07:11.943 --> 07:12.844
You're awake, right?

07:12.884 --> 07:13.984
You don't need us now.

07:14.545 --> 07:15.165
You're good.

07:15.285 --> 07:20.889
Moco-chan, I don't think that's going to be okay.

07:21.029 --> 07:29.114
I wish, but... But for Ruffians that are joining us for the first time today, we're sleepy.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.476
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:32.636 --> 07:34.097
I'm not sleepy.

07:34.337 --> 07:35.838
A bit grumpy too.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.159
I'm not grumpy.

07:38.479 --> 07:41.081
Yes, you might be wondering what this is.

07:41.101 --> 07:44.524
So, yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

07:45.305 --> 07:52.470
It's like a short format morning show that's held on Fridays and Wednesdays and Mondays.

07:52.490 --> 07:55.192
It's hosted by us.

07:59.468 --> 08:01.789
You don't need us here now, right?

08:01.829 --> 08:01.989
Right?

08:22.142 --> 08:25.384
Please let us know so we can go back to bed with the hashtag.

08:26.044 --> 08:29.146
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

08:29.986 --> 08:31.427
That would be nice, huh?

08:31.447 --> 08:38.531
Ruffians!

08:39.471 --> 08:41.232
Let's all BAU BAU for now!

08:41.672 --> 08:42.573
BAU BAU it!

08:42.613 --> 08:44.914
To a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:44.934 --> 08:48.356
And then let's all head right back to bed afterwards, yo!

08:53.737 --> 08:54.237
BAU BAU!

09:09.745 --> 09:17.093
I... I think that made me go ruffian sub-paro this time, or... Or... Was that it?

09:17.553 --> 09:20.336
Or... That wasn't right, or... Was it?

09:20.376 --> 09:21.838
Maybe I jumped a bit.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.740
Did I forget to prepare this part?

09:24.361 --> 09:24.401
Or...

09:25.239 --> 09:25.999
Oh, no, no.

09:26.159 --> 09:27.120
There's no Pero.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.020
No, yeah.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.700
I think it may be Pero.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.741
Pero's still in trouble, right?

09:31.761 --> 09:32.261
You know?

09:32.922 --> 09:36.843
Last time he was tied up and everything on a train track.

09:37.483 --> 09:37.903
Yeah.

09:38.083 --> 09:38.443
Yeah.

09:38.463 --> 09:39.764
There's somebody like that.

09:39.804 --> 09:42.205
Maybe he didn't make it out safely.

09:42.645 --> 09:43.905
Maybe he's still there.

09:44.865 --> 09:49.487
Sure seems like no ruffians have seen him since, right?

09:49.687 --> 09:52.408
That's very concerning, right, ruffians?

09:57.399 --> 10:03.682
Did you fall asleep, Moco-chan?

10:07.764 --> 10:08.044
No.

10:08.964 --> 10:10.525
All we can do is hope, huh?

10:11.465 --> 10:14.166
Maybe we'll see him after we get some rest.

10:15.387 --> 10:16.908
See him in dreams.

10:17.028 --> 10:18.268
We are dreams.

10:18.848 --> 10:19.109
Yeah.

10:26.621 --> 10:42.694
That's right, I... I... Moco-chan... Yesterday was our first YouTube short upload and... It was our first date on streaming live on YouTube.

10:42.774 --> 10:44.595
It was our first YouTube short.

10:45.156 --> 10:47.978
But we still had a lot planned, right?

10:48.018 --> 10:49.319
We did a lot of things, right?

10:50.436 --> 10:53.058
Yeah, we had a Twitter space over on Twitter.

10:53.498 --> 10:55.920
Not on YouTube, a Twitter space on Twitter.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.381
We did what again?

10:58.401 --> 11:08.228
We tied up some of the FUWAMOCOs together with you, but... We also uploaded a new short video to our YouTube channel too!

11:08.248 --> 11:11.130
Yeah, yeah.

11:11.850 --> 11:12.270
Abort.

11:12.591 --> 11:13.011
Abort.

11:13.511 --> 11:15.292
BAU BAU BAU, right?

11:15.332 --> 11:15.693
Yeah.

11:16.293 --> 11:17.694
Yeah, it's simple.

11:18.434 --> 11:19.015
It's silly.

11:20.404 --> 11:20.804
Yeah.

11:21.285 --> 11:23.526
Mococo injection to your heart, right.

11:25.028 --> 11:25.788
Yeah.

11:25.808 --> 11:28.370
That sounds good right now.

11:29.531 --> 11:35.135
Maybe I'll take some of that after I rest my eyes a little bit longer.

11:35.275 --> 11:35.676
Yeah.

11:36.296 --> 11:41.060
Let me just, you know, I'm just gonna go for a stretch in the bed and... You can't!

11:41.100 --> 11:42.721
That's not fair, okay?

11:42.741 --> 11:44.582
It needs to be equal.

11:44.743 --> 11:47.785
I want to sleep too, so you have to wait for me, okay?

11:48.786 --> 11:48.966
What?

11:50.401 --> 11:56.244
But, yeah, that's what we did yesterday, so... Make sure you check out the new short, okay, Ruffians?

11:56.304 --> 11:57.165
Thank you.

11:57.265 --> 11:58.445
No, you already did!

12:00.066 --> 12:02.648
We're the only ones watching you on here, okay?

12:03.648 --> 12:04.068
Okay.

12:05.509 --> 12:11.032
Well, the topic of the Twitter space, we did a Twitter space, not a YouTube Twitter space.

12:12.153 --> 12:16.915
Um, thanks to Twitter now, our den is a little bit cleaner.

12:16.935 --> 12:18.156
Tidier.

12:19.420 --> 12:23.023
Got rid of a lot of fluff and fuzz, and there was a lot of fluff and fuzz.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.925
Yeah, there was a lot of fluff and fuzz.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.066
Good morning.

12:26.826 --> 12:31.791
Yeah, and Moco-chan, you worked really hard to hold all the laundry nicely, right?

12:31.811 --> 12:36.715
I did, but, but... I forgot I saw you in the dryer.

12:36.815 --> 12:37.115
Yeah.

12:37.155 --> 12:37.996
Convenient.

12:38.296 --> 12:40.358
I forgot it, Ruffians.

12:40.598 --> 12:43.140
And what happened to the laundry, Moco-chan?

12:45.382 --> 12:46.083
It's still there.

12:48.450 --> 12:49.891
I was too tired to do it.

12:51.092 --> 12:52.733
I'll do it later, okay?

12:52.753 --> 12:55.274
I promise.

12:56.755 --> 12:58.096
Later, okay?

12:59.557 --> 13:02.079
I already have wrinkles and it won't change.

13:02.399 --> 13:04.760
You won't be able to tell, okay, ruffians?

13:05.861 --> 13:06.621
It's fine.

13:07.102 --> 13:10.544
Yeah, well... Whatever, I guess.

13:12.505 --> 13:15.647
As long as we can get some more sleep soon.

13:15.767 --> 13:16.147
Right?

13:16.408 --> 13:16.788
It's good.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.411
BAU BAU.

13:21.332 --> 13:24.775
This is the next part.

13:25.376 --> 13:26.196
Ruffians.

13:27.577 --> 13:28.618
You know what?

13:29.139 --> 13:29.959
You know what?

13:29.979 --> 13:33.362
I think there are no misunderstandings.

13:34.443 --> 13:36.284
No misunderstandings.

13:37.746 --> 13:38.526
Yeah.

13:39.147 --> 13:41.048
Definitely no misunderstandings.

13:41.108 --> 13:41.649
Okay.

13:45.281 --> 13:47.782
I can't remember anything at least, okay?

13:47.942 --> 13:48.463
Why, why?

14:05.586 --> 14:16.316
Always choose and think and be careful with our every word, you know, before it leaves our mouths like a proper demon-god dog, you know.

14:17.077 --> 14:20.660
Making sure we don't say anything that could be misunderstood.

14:21.601 --> 14:23.603
No matter how energetic we are.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.043
BAU BAU!

14:32.401 --> 14:34.342
We're the only ones allowed to be sleepy, okay?

14:34.362 --> 14:35.243
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:35.263 --> 14:36.163
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:36.183 --> 14:36.824
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:36.844 --> 14:37.924
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:37.964 --> 14:38.805
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:38.825 --> 14:39.445
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:39.465 --> 14:41.706
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:41.726 --> 14:42.307
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:42.327 --> 14:43.668
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:43.768 --> 14:44.488
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:44.508 --> 14:49.011
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:49.031 --> 14:50.672
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:50.712 --> 14:51.372
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:51.392 --> 14:52.192
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:52.212 --> 14:55.514
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:55.534 --> 14:56.755
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:56.935 --> 14:57.716
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:58.096 --> 14:59.076
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:59.096 --> 14:59.657
That's how it works, ruffians!

14:59.677 --> 15:00.697
That's how it works, ruffians!

15:00.717 --> 15:01.358
That's how it works, ruffians!

15:01.398 --> 15:01.518
That's

15:02.995 --> 15:03.235
Anime NYC!

15:03.255 --> 15:03.715
What did you just say?

15:03.756 --> 15:03.976
Anime NYC?

15:04.096 --> 15:05.917
You know, it's an event that we're having the audience participate at.

15:05.937 --> 15:06.637
What kind of event was it again?

15:06.657 --> 15:07.318
What kind of event was it again?

15:07.338 --> 15:09.099
What kind of event was it again?

15:09.119 --> 15:10.240
What kind of event was it again?

15:10.260 --> 15:10.980
What kind of event was it again?

15:11.000 --> 15:11.801
What kind of event was it again?

15:11.821 --> 15:12.501
What kind of event was it again?

15:12.521 --> 15:13.182
What kind of event was it again?

15:13.202 --> 15:15.143
What kind of event was it again?

15:15.183 --> 15:15.944
What kind of event was it again?

15:15.964 --> 15:16.924
What kind of event was it again?

15:16.944 --> 15:18.205
What kind of event was it again?

15:18.225 --> 15:19.026
What kind of event was it again?

15:19.046 --> 15:20.326
What kind of event was it again?

15:20.346 --> 15:21.127
What kind of event was it again?

15:21.147 --> 15:21.847
What kind of event was it again?

15:21.867 --> 15:22.608
What kind of event was it again?

15:23.228 --> 15:23.989
What kind of event was it again?

15:24.009 --> 15:24.729
What kind of event was it again?

15:24.749 --> 15:25.690
What kind of event was it again?

15:25.750 --> 15:26.370
What kind of event was it again?

15:26.390 --> 15:27.071
What kind of event was it again?

15:27.111 --> 15:29.292
What kind of event was it again?

15:29.312 --> 15:29.933
What kind of event was it again?

15:29.953 --> 15:30.173
What kind

15:33.183 --> 15:39.245
It wasn't an anime convention.

15:39.526 --> 15:44.487
Well, us and Advent, all of us, we're Advent.

15:45.008 --> 15:47.949
We'll be making an appearance as guest star.

15:48.449 --> 15:57.032
You know, we'll be doing some extra special appearances at the hololive booth and at the exhibitors hall too, right?

15:58.813 --> 16:01.234
You know, but

16:03.030 --> 16:04.072
It'll be extra fun.

16:04.453 --> 16:09.643
But if you're not a ruffian located in New York, it might be rough, right?

16:11.167 --> 16:12.008
Not actually.

16:12.429 --> 16:12.670
No.

16:13.618 --> 16:14.999
You're not actually okay.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.183
As long as you have a VR account, you can do it, Ruffians.

16:19.223 --> 16:20.864
Yeah, you don't need equipment, okay?

16:20.924 --> 16:21.444
Wake up.

16:22.025 --> 16:24.967
No misunderstanding, no matter how sleepy you are.

16:24.987 --> 16:27.529
No VR equipment necessary.

16:27.549 --> 16:29.131
You just need an account.

16:29.511 --> 16:30.952
You have an account, right?

16:30.972 --> 16:33.915
If you don't make an account, you can make an account.

16:34.775 --> 16:34.995
Got it?

16:35.016 --> 16:37.918
I don't really know sleeping in, okay, Ruffians?

16:37.938 --> 16:40.360
You got it.

16:41.024 --> 16:43.485
Moco-chan, you understand that too, right?

16:44.405 --> 16:47.187
No sleeping because we're doing the performing part.

16:47.547 --> 16:48.447
We should be awake.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.288
If we're awake, we gotta perform.

16:52.509 --> 16:52.829
Right?

16:53.269 --> 16:53.789
Yeah.

16:53.929 --> 16:54.890
Just like now.

16:56.050 --> 16:56.310
Right.

16:56.530 --> 16:57.491
Just like now.

16:57.671 --> 17:04.614
But we'll be doing a Rock n' Rawr Party mini at 1PM PT on a Saturday.

17:05.720 --> 17:12.585
And FUWAMOCO question and answer at 7.30am PT on a Sunday, okay?

17:12.685 --> 17:13.966
7.30am PT.

17:14.887 --> 17:17.969
Ruffians, I'll cry if you don't wake up for it.

17:19.530 --> 17:26.615
And you wouldn't want to make us jealous of all that comfy REM sleep you're getting, right?

17:27.096 --> 17:31.119
Sleep REM is a terrible, dangerous thing, you know?

17:37.816 --> 18:04.713
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

18:06.038 --> 18:06.919
That was happy.

18:06.939 --> 18:10.201
For a brief moment.

18:11.641 --> 18:17.165
And then, as we got more and more done, suddenly more and more got added.

18:18.906 --> 18:21.848
And, you know those were things that were missed?

18:23.309 --> 18:25.410
They're ones that's ruined.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.131
Like, very soon.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.893
Like, tomorrow is ruined.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.395
Yeah, not to mention FUWAMOCO.

18:34.284 --> 18:40.968
We have our own projects like cover songs and other fun things we'd like to have come out eventually too.

18:42.269 --> 18:46.672
You know, like we talked about, we're really happy to have homework.

18:46.712 --> 18:48.072
We want more homework.

18:48.433 --> 18:54.396
Homework is the stuff to, you know, to do to be able to make super cool things happen.

18:54.416 --> 18:55.537
Super things happen.

18:55.897 --> 18:56.938
I know it.

18:57.864 --> 19:07.232
A little while ago, we talked about how maybe we'll have an actual day off to rest for the first time since debut.

19:08.913 --> 19:15.879
But with all things away, we'll be lucky if we get one by the end of the year.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.503
Yeah, but we are hoping sometime I might write.

19:21.263 --> 19:21.624
Yeah.

19:23.585 --> 19:26.528
We just looked up how to do the homework, ruffians.

19:27.574 --> 19:29.676
We want to get to the cool stuff.

19:31.857 --> 19:33.259
Cool stuff is cool.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.820
Cool stuff is cool.

19:35.520 --> 19:43.427
Well, next we have the doggy... That's right.

19:44.868 --> 19:46.489
Natto challenge.

19:46.870 --> 19:48.111
Natto of the Day.

19:48.131 --> 19:50.933
I know, but... Yeah, this is called natto.

19:50.953 --> 19:51.153
Natto.

19:54.915 --> 19:55.455
Really?

19:55.615 --> 19:57.076
I did not do it!

19:57.596 --> 20:01.657
Actually... There's no more left.

20:02.698 --> 20:04.638
I ate the last pack this morning.

20:04.658 --> 20:07.239
Were you not sleepy?

20:07.259 --> 20:09.460
Yeah... You didn't realize.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.700
I try not to.

20:11.560 --> 20:19.303
Well, I... Ruffians, some almonds or something should be fine, right?

20:19.323 --> 20:22.064
Moco-chan, you're bad with almonds, right?

20:26.744 --> 20:30.785
I'm fine with almonds, yes.

20:31.145 --> 20:31.825
Scary.

20:32.705 --> 20:34.085
Almonds are not good.

20:34.365 --> 20:41.847
Yeah, especially, you know, ones that were grown in the same place as the dried natto you had last week, right?

20:42.067 --> 20:43.407
I can't eat almonds.

20:43.727 --> 20:45.628
Almonds grown in the U.S.A.

20:45.908 --> 20:47.648
I'm too tired to eat almonds.

20:48.168 --> 20:49.988
Yeah, no almonds, right?

20:50.469 --> 20:52.869
I can't do it, I can't eat the almonds!

20:53.436 --> 20:55.057
I'm not gonna eat the almond.

20:55.077 --> 20:56.177
I'm not gonna eat the almond.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.018
Here it comes, Ruffian Moco-chan.

20:58.038 --> 21:01.039
Moco-chan's going to challenge something she's bad at.

21:01.099 --> 21:02.619
You feed me the almond.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.440
I'm too tired.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.761
My hands won't do it.

21:05.881 --> 21:08.022
I'm too tired to do that, Moco-chan.

21:08.102 --> 21:08.802
I need you.

21:08.882 --> 21:09.762
I need your strength.

21:09.802 --> 21:10.843
No, I'm not gonna feed you.

21:10.863 --> 21:12.003
Feed me the almond!

21:12.043 --> 21:12.963
I'm not gonna feed you.

21:12.983 --> 21:16.745
I need to feed you the almond.

21:16.765 --> 21:19.686
Okay, well, if I'm gonna feed you the almond... Just one.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.348
Gotta be a handful, okay?

21:22.388 --> 21:23.088
This one!

21:23.248 --> 21:24.470
Here you go, Moco-chan.

21:25.190 --> 21:28.533
I'm gonna... There we go.

21:31.776 --> 21:32.797
Eat them all, okay?

21:39.163 --> 21:40.084
Moco-chan.

21:40.805 --> 21:42.206
Picture you two, okay?

21:42.226 --> 21:45.289
I know that you're tired, but that's a mouthful of almonds.

21:50.749 --> 21:54.732
Are you breathing?

21:58.416 --> 22:01.738
Oh, the ruffians.

22:01.798 --> 22:02.359
I ate them.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.521
Did you actually?

22:04.541 --> 22:06.522
I ate them.

22:06.723 --> 22:10.045
Don't you have enough strength to eat a handful of almonds?

22:10.065 --> 22:12.107
I can't chew them, I don't have the strength.

22:12.427 --> 22:17.411
My mouth was too filled with almonds to chew the almonds.

22:18.777 --> 22:20.839
I did kinda stuff them in there, huh?

22:21.600 --> 22:24.822
You stuffed all the almonds into my mouth at once!

22:24.883 --> 22:26.664
I did very lovingly though.

22:26.684 --> 22:29.046
No, it was very rough!

22:30.487 --> 22:32.349
I kinda just threw them in, huh?

22:33.911 --> 22:35.732
Well... Ruffians!

22:36.513 --> 22:38.054
That's amazing, she did it!

22:38.675 --> 22:39.876
Wow, the almonds!

22:40.576 --> 22:40.997
Awesome.

22:42.960 --> 22:49.606
We're almost at the end of the show, right Moco-chan?

22:49.646 --> 22:51.287
Doggie of the Day!

22:51.307 --> 22:55.591
I was thinking about the sleeping part, but... Doggie of the Day!

22:55.991 --> 22:58.254
Ruffians, here's the Doggie of the Day!

22:58.274 --> 23:00.055
Aka goes BAU BAU!

23:00.095 --> 23:00.255
Cutie!

23:07.648 --> 23:10.589
Is this a photo of us in the morning, right?

23:10.609 --> 23:11.150
Right.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.010
Right, it really is.

23:13.110 --> 23:14.211
It looks just like me.

23:14.991 --> 23:17.832
It looks like me, but my arm goes up.

23:18.832 --> 23:23.474
I know I can't be a very strong hair, but fluid is just funny.

23:23.734 --> 23:27.296
Because right now, I could care less about fluid.

23:28.316 --> 23:30.297
Is Akko gonna eat the almonds?

23:30.837 --> 23:32.278
Somebody has to eat the almonds.

23:34.229 --> 23:36.910
Well Aka, you could boil my food.

23:37.870 --> 23:42.032
And I'll boil your coffee bed and then I can get some more rest.

23:43.272 --> 23:46.853
Maybe... Moco-chan, stop yawning otherwise I'm gonna continue to yawn.

23:46.913 --> 23:49.854
Maybe Aka could just finish up the show for us.

23:50.674 --> 23:55.456
And then ruffians would be happy because then it would be a different host instead of us.

23:55.676 --> 24:00.538
Because it was always FUWAMOCO who was the host but this time it would be Aka, right?

24:00.618 --> 24:01.318
So it's good.

24:01.815 --> 24:06.619
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning.

24:07.520 --> 24:11.022
How does FUWAMOCO BAU BAU for FUWAMOCO-chan?

24:11.363 --> 24:24.733
How does FUWAMOCO BAU BAU for FUWAMOCO-chan?

24:25.494 --> 24:28.516
How does FUWAMOCO BAU BAU for FUWAMOCO-chan?

24:28.977 --> 24:29.878
BAU BAU!

24:31.129 --> 24:31.950
I'm not FUWAMOCO.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.591
Thank you for the works.

24:34.972 --> 24:38.275
Well, Akka doesn't really hide anything.

24:38.315 --> 24:39.937
You know, food is important.

24:39.957 --> 24:41.898
You know, you touch.

24:41.918 --> 24:43.440
That's grumpy.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.742
Easy story.

24:45.762 --> 24:49.685
But you know, he also brings the energy.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.587
The energy that FUWAMOCO doesn't have.

24:51.607 --> 24:53.709
To protect the owner's family.

24:54.549 --> 24:56.011
The energy we always have!

24:58.206 --> 24:59.967
Mococo-chan.

24:59.987 --> 25:00.307
Meow.

25:00.347 --> 25:03.109
BAU BAU.

25:03.129 --> 25:07.492
Say BAU BAU.

25:07.512 --> 25:08.172
BAU BAU!

25:08.732 --> 25:10.534
BAU BAU.

25:12.295 --> 25:12.575
Walk.

25:12.895 --> 25:13.255
Walk.

25:13.375 --> 25:13.756
Walk.

25:14.056 --> 25:16.117
That's how you do it, Mococo-chan.

25:17.178 --> 25:18.378
Today we're on the walk.

25:18.438 --> 25:20.320
It says Doggie of the Day, Mococo-chan.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.201
This is a walk, not a doggy.

25:24.943 --> 25:25.363
Play.

25:33.664 --> 25:34.744
How did you do this?

25:37.666 --> 25:40.127
I feel really sleepy looking at this photo.

25:41.288 --> 25:43.329
How did you make me feel sleepier?

25:43.789 --> 25:48.952
Why this photo makes me want to jump into bed even faster than I already do!

25:52.228 --> 26:01.493
Why is the point of a long walk outside when you know you could just go a few steps over to your bed full of warm and fluffy and fuzzy pillows?

26:02.333 --> 26:02.874
Yeah.

26:02.914 --> 26:03.314
Right.

26:03.874 --> 26:05.555
That's a good question, Moco-chan.

26:05.715 --> 26:07.176
Good job!

26:07.236 --> 26:07.936
Good job!

26:08.677 --> 26:09.357
Good job!

26:10.177 --> 26:11.098
Stay warm.

26:11.118 --> 26:12.358
Stay safe.

26:12.499 --> 26:12.919
BAU BAU!

26:12.979 --> 26:14.660
BAU BAU!

26:19.582 --> 26:23.545
I think we got a question too, so we should probably answer that.

26:23.565 --> 26:25.566
Hi ruffians.

26:27.548 --> 26:31.410
There's a cute picture too.

26:33.472 --> 26:37.435
I wish I had this kind of strength in my arm.

26:38.115 --> 26:40.557
But the question reads, Hi FUWAMOCO!

26:41.457 --> 26:41.958
Hello.

26:43.021 --> 26:43.721
Good morning.

26:44.021 --> 26:51.443
My school just had a sports festival today, so may I ask which of you is better at sports?

26:51.463 --> 26:54.664
And which sports do you like the most, BAU BAU?

26:55.664 --> 26:56.345
Sports.

26:57.665 --> 26:58.285
Sports.

26:58.645 --> 27:00.646
I'm better at sports, that's for sure.

27:00.666 --> 27:02.226
We play a lot of sports.

27:02.506 --> 27:04.147
I'm better at sports.

27:04.487 --> 27:07.288
But none of them we really like that much.

27:08.188 --> 27:12.029
We do soccer and basketball and

27:13.148 --> 27:14.369
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

27:14.389 --> 27:14.709
BAU BAU!

27:14.729 --> 27:18.672
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

27:32.614 --> 27:36.495
Ruffians, thank you so much for all your submissions today!

28:00.452 --> 28:05.976
I'm glad I've been catching some more Zs, but instead you made these submissions for us.

28:06.637 --> 28:09.219
And that's actually really amazing.

28:10.540 --> 28:15.003
Thank you for making FUWAMOCO Morning, you know, something together with us.

28:15.043 --> 28:16.104
Yeah, not sleepy.

28:16.604 --> 28:17.385
Not sleepy.

28:18.306 --> 28:30.175
Yeah, you know we're always looking forward to more of your doggies, and lots of questions, and Pero Sightings too, especially since you know, you know,

28:35.660 --> 28:36.401
Next stream.

28:37.542 --> 28:42.607
Next stream we have... Fashion dreamer.

28:42.647 --> 28:43.628
Fashion designer.

28:43.648 --> 28:44.069
Yeah.

28:44.870 --> 28:46.091
Dreamer, dreamer.

28:46.952 --> 28:58.044
Yeah, you know we... We're gonna get some more homework done and then take on even another job as, you know, us Demon Gaeta who become fashion designers.

28:59.332 --> 29:08.879
Yeah, do you think ruffians will be able to work together properly as a team to be able to make the most fashionable and cutest girls ever?

29:08.899 --> 29:15.523
Or maybe we'll just put some pajamas on them and then call it a day?

29:15.543 --> 29:17.745
Moco-chan.

29:19.486 --> 29:20.026
Pajamas.

29:20.267 --> 29:20.927
Pajamas.

29:21.868 --> 29:25.070
Okay, well, let's take a look at our schedule, ruffians!

29:26.721 --> 29:28.742
Go ahead, you can take a look.

29:30.283 --> 29:32.104
I'm a bit tired to explain.

29:32.124 --> 29:40.428
I almost done the show here today, so bedtime soon.

29:41.088 --> 29:41.648
Duh.

29:42.829 --> 29:44.170
It's still homework, but...

29:45.885 --> 29:50.388
Ruffians will be starting Metal Gear Solid for the first time on Tuesday though!

29:50.708 --> 29:51.888
First time ever!

29:52.709 --> 29:57.492
That kinda sounds a bit more exciting than even getting 8 hours of sleep, right?

29:57.612 --> 29:58.152
It does!

30:02.254 --> 30:02.875
BAU BAU!

30:03.135 --> 30:06.216
BAU BAU!

30:06.276 --> 30:07.317
Ruffians!

30:08.738 --> 30:09.478
Thank you!

30:10.879 --> 30:12.220
