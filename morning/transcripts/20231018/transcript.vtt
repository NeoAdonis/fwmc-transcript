00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.569
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.433
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:17.437
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:19.499
BAU BAU!

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.866
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:28.048
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.589
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.971
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:41.494
Thank you for joining us today for our 33rd episode!

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:41.534
3-3.

00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:48.337
It feels like it was just the other day that was a 2-2.

00:05:48.437 --> 00:05:49.797
Moco-chan!

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.978
Aren't you a bit energetic?

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.199
Yeah.

00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:02.211
I saw some first-time Ruffians joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning today.

00:06:02.392 --> 00:06:05.995
So just so you know, don't get confused.

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:06.977
No confusion.

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:08.218
No misunderstanding.

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:16.066
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:16.747
No Thursdays.

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:19.208
Why is that, Moco-chan?

00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:22.389
Because it's not FUWAMOCO.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.009
Yeah!

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.011
And the show is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:34.752
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:40.854
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:45.495
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:47.196
BAU BAU!

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:48.776
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:50.277
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:52.117
BAU BAU!

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:52.978
BAU BAU!

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:53.858
BAU BAU!

00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:54.698
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:55.798
BAU BAU!

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.699
BAU BAU!

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.939
This is an interesting discovery.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.820
A bit yappy today, huh?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.462
A little bit yappy today.

00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:10.883
Ruffians, have you seen Pero around recently?

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:11.643
I think they have.

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:15.184
Because we have another Pero Sighting!

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:17.165
Where is he this time?

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:28.417
It looks like maybe this Ruffian was a bit rudely disturbed when they were trying to clean up all the leaves.

00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:31.399
Was the Ruffian disturbed or was Pero disturbed?

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.680
Good question.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.063
Well, you know, Ruffians, we talked about this a little bit before.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.885
Moco-chan, you like the leaves, right?

00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:44.687
Pero, Pero enjoys a good pile of all leaves too.

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:49.310
He doesn't have to worry about bugs or dirt as much, though.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.491
Yeah, he's lucky.

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.432
Yeah, he's round.

00:07:51.692 --> 00:07:53.773
He's not too fluffy, not too fuzzy.

00:07:53.793 --> 00:07:56.175
And he's pretty easy to watch, too.

00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:57.516
Yeah, he can clean well.

00:07:57.816 --> 00:07:58.357
Yeah.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:04.241
Although, you know, Pero does have to worry about grass stains sometimes.

00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:06.042
He does stain pretty easily, you know.

00:08:06.062 --> 00:08:09.364
But... Yeah... Ruffians.

00:08:09.624 --> 00:08:11.586
I'll be honest.

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:14.808
You know, I've always sort of thought

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.135
I wanna see a tie-dye Pero.

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.476
You know, it's sort of off-season.

00:08:21.796 --> 00:08:24.237
But he sort of look like an easter egg, right?

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:27.378
It'd be fun.

00:08:29.528 --> 00:08:30.809
I don't know if you'd like that though.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.129
I don't care!

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.991
But anyways, you know the fall leaves are super da fun.

00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:39.172
Right, Ruffians?

00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:45.814
And if you look, look really closely, some of the leaves in this pile kind of look like Pero's wings too.

00:08:46.654 --> 00:08:48.195
They're spiky and kind of like a...

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:52.558
Maybe not quite a pale purple, but a pretty deep purple too.

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:58.382
You know maybe that's what attracted him to the pile in particular to begin with.

00:08:59.323 --> 00:09:02.525
We're glad that he disappeared before you had to use violence though.

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:03.746
Went once that.

00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:06.668
You know that might not have ended up well for you.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:12.384
BAU BAU!

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:15.205
Good job getting up there and cleaning up those leaves.

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.347
It must be cold, but you did it.

00:09:18.727 --> 00:09:20.728
BAU BAU!

00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:22.548
I love you.

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:25.410
There's some exciting news coming up!

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.150
Our senpai...

00:09:29.713 --> 00:09:34.399
Kaela-senpai is gonna be having her 3D showcase!

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:42.650
Kaela-senpai's hololive ID is gonna be having her 3D showcase this Friday at 6am PT.

00:09:44.753 --> 00:09:47.037
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:10:01.613 --> 00:10:04.376
Any ideas, Ruffians?

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:08.500
Real life Minecraft!

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.382
That'd be pretty cool, too.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:14.906
I was kind of thinking that could be possible, too.

00:10:15.326 --> 00:10:16.868
I'm really curious.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:23.094
You know, seeing Zetta-senpai have such an eye-opening experience, too.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.673
We're really looking forward to seeing Kaela-senpai's showcase as well!

00:10:28.713 --> 00:10:29.773
Just what will she have?

00:10:29.793 --> 00:10:30.374
You know it!

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:31.615
Super duper curious!

00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:33.096
Good luck, Kaela-senpai!

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:33.716
BAU BAU!

00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:39.520
Make sure you watch Ruffians, okay?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:46.505
You know, it's just a couple hours before FUWAMOCO Morning, so... That's pretty easy to fit in the schedule, right?

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:47.645
Just wake up a little bit.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.027
A little bit early.

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:52.829
You know it's Kaela-senpai's special day, right?

00:10:52.849 --> 00:10:53.229
12 hours 3D!

00:10:56.132 --> 00:10:57.393
The happiness doesn't end!

00:11:06.584 --> 00:11:07.505
Another senpai.

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:08.526
Another senpai.

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:09.327
Another senpai.

00:11:09.828 --> 00:11:12.050
Hakui Koyori senpai!

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:18.999
She just had her 150th episode of Asa Koyo yesterday!

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.521
Bye-bye!

00:11:21.822 --> 00:11:24.845
Ruffians, you've seen Asa Koyo, right?

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:25.967
Yeah.

00:11:27.843 --> 00:11:29.565
We're so happy for you!

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:34.568
You know, we're sure it's a lot of work, but it's a show that's so well-loved by everyone.

00:11:34.788 --> 00:11:42.654
We hope that FUWAMOCO Morning can continue for a long time, just like Asahiyo, and become just as well-loved too.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:54.142
And Ruffians, it just wasn't the 115th episode, but Advent and even FUWAMOCO Morning from last Friday was featured on the episode too!

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.062
I'm the 50th.

00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:00.184
We're really happy.

00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:05.008
Thank you so much for your support by Holodog.

00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:05.849
BAU BAU!

00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:08.691
BAU BAU!

00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:09.271
BAU BAU!

00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:14.696
And you might have caught it the other day.

00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:21.242
There's been some news.

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:27.985
While this week, Advent, we're having a special Halloween party that we're putting on.

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:30.406
But, not just that.

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:33.047
There's been...

00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:39.283
Very special Halloween voice drama that was released!

00:12:39.403 --> 00:12:40.163
BAU BAU!

00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:41.464
Have you listened?

00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:42.204
Have you?

00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:42.984
Have you?

00:12:43.024 --> 00:12:43.324
I don't know.

00:12:43.564 --> 00:12:50.347
There might be some Ruffians that still don't know, but this voice drama went on sale and it's called The Manor.

00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:57.370
It's very different from the usual voice parts because this time we became different roles and acted out a spooky mystery.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.911
It was a really fun experience, building on characters.

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:02.617
I'm Maria.

00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:03.457
I'm Moco-chan.

00:13:03.557 --> 00:13:04.438
I'm Aria.

00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:07.440
I'm acting out the story and everything, too!

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.181
It was good!

00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:16.415
You liked it?

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:19.063
You liked it?

00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:30.114
There's both a Japanese script and an English script so you can check them both out But the audio is only in English It's only English But we hope that you'll check it out on the whole store and support us

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:30.176
You

00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:31.356
And Advent too!

00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:32.817
You know we did our best!

00:13:33.117 --> 00:13:37.257
It was really fun, so we hope that we can do more stuff like that in the future.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:42.138
It would be nice to be able to get more opportunities like this to grow ourselves and try new things.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:47.039
And Ruffians, if you check it out, then that means you'll be able to hear FUWAMOCO's first attempt.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.420
Why are you laughing?

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.380
First attempt!

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.021
It was our first attempt.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.641
BAU BAU!

00:13:57.022 --> 00:13:59.982
Thank you!

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:02.142
Look, Biboo's crying!

00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:05.203
You wanna hear why Biboo's crying?

00:14:05.343 --> 00:14:05.643
Why?

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:07.263
You have to check it out!

00:14:07.363 --> 00:14:13.445
There's definitely a lot of different emotions, so... BAU BAU!

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:13.965
Ruffians!

00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:23.530
End of the happy news for today.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.210
I don't know.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.371
This is a bit of a complicated feeling.

00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:28.532
Is it complicated?

00:14:30.172 --> 00:14:30.652
Yeah.

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:33.514
Ruffians, we have an apology to make.

00:14:34.694 --> 00:14:35.874
But it's not to you.

00:14:35.894 --> 00:14:36.515
It's not to you.

00:14:36.535 --> 00:14:37.595
Why would we apologize?

00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:41.477
Did you see our Twitter this morning, Ruffians?

00:14:41.937 --> 00:14:46.399
Did you?

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:49.660
Well, our neighbors

00:14:50.802 --> 00:14:53.023
My poor, poor neighbors.

00:14:56.984 --> 00:15:04.046
Actually, we might have been a little bit loud last night, but it wasn't our fault!

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:09.367
You know, actually, we were up all night recording a song.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:14.289
Even though we're supposed to be quiet at night time so that everyone can sleep.

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:19.836
Just this once we needed to do this.

00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:20.556
Just this once, okay?

00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:21.117
Just this once.

00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:25.419
We're very quiet almost all of the time otherwise.

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.980
No BAU BAUing either.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.261
No.

00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:32.644
You know we have a strict rule of no streaming horror games during night because of this.

00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:33.244
Yeah.

00:15:33.264 --> 00:15:36.306
Because you know, we just can't control ourselves.

00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:41.069
Yeah, but we thought that maybe just this once would be okay.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.351
But, you know what?

00:15:45.023 --> 00:15:50.025
Our neighbors though, they're really really noisy most of the time.

00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:52.245
Even past midnight too.

00:15:52.445 --> 00:15:56.306
Now we can hear shouting and hammering and chopping.

00:15:56.486 --> 00:16:00.488
Even the songs that they're listening to on TV at all times of day and night.

00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:02.308
It doesn't stop.

00:16:03.248 --> 00:16:07.070
Once we even sung along with the lyrics of a song that they were playing.

00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:11.596
But you know, we never ever complain.

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:12.217
It's okay.

00:16:12.397 --> 00:16:17.119
You know, instead we like to think of it as like a nice sign that we're not alone.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.420
Yeah.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.562
Yeah, so we hope that our singing maybe didn't keep them up.

00:16:21.922 --> 00:16:23.763
Maybe they could look at it positively.

00:16:23.863 --> 00:16:26.405
Yeah, maybe it was like a lullaby.

00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:30.087
Yeah, but if it wasn't, sorry neighbors.

00:16:30.107 --> 00:16:30.587
BAU BAU.

00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:32.028
BAU BAU.

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:39.069
Ruffians, would you be okay with a lullaby through your walls?

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.630
Bite them.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.770
Early access!

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.091
I don't know if I want to bite them.

00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:46.971
Bite them?

00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:48.291
Why would I bite them?

00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:50.972
It would not be that tasty.

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:53.473
Early access, right!

00:16:53.493 --> 00:16:54.834
Early access!

00:16:56.812 --> 00:16:58.093
BAU BAU!

00:16:58.133 --> 00:16:58.453
BAU BAU!

00:16:58.513 --> 00:16:58.893
BAU BAU!

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:20.085
There's a misunderstanding, Ruffians.

00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:22.086
That we kind of need to clear up.

00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:24.108
It's very important.

00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:27.450
There's been a lot of misunderstandings this week, Moco-chan.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.451
I thought we were doing better.

00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:30.712
I thought so too.

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:35.535
Well... This is something we need you to understand, okay?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.858
Because you're the one who's misunderstanding this.

00:17:38.878 --> 00:17:39.058
Okay?

00:17:39.178 --> 00:17:40.038
It's not our fault.

00:17:40.138 --> 00:17:42.220
We saw that there are a number of Ruffians.

00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:46.326
You seem to have an improper understanding of this.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:47.887
Yeah.

00:17:48.107 --> 00:17:56.834
Yeah, you seem to think that we always somehow have to mention or like include the fact that we're sweaty during every one of our streams.

00:17:58.335 --> 00:17:59.055
It's not the case.

00:17:59.235 --> 00:17:59.636
It's not.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:00.336
It's not.

00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:01.077
It's not the case.

00:18:01.097 --> 00:18:01.697
Not at all!

00:18:01.857 --> 00:18:02.718
Not at all!

00:18:02.738 --> 00:18:03.038
Ruffians!

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.761
Ruffians.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:09.102
What the heck?! !

00:18:11.198 --> 00:18:11.978
What the heck?

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:13.079
You know it.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.900
We don't enjoy it.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.360
But it's hot!

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.641
It's really, really hot!

00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:23.443
You know, especially when we're focused on gaming or playing something scary.

00:18:23.963 --> 00:18:24.524
You know it.

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:30.826
Especially when we're cramped close together in a room for a really long time.

00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:34.388
You know, the heat makes scary games even more intense for us.

00:18:35.028 --> 00:18:37.049
We're fighting for our lives.

00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:38.964
Okay?

00:18:39.765 --> 00:18:41.946
It's important that we let you know, Ruffians.

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:44.347
We are sweating!

00:18:44.947 --> 00:18:49.810
And that is how hard we are in that world and the reality of the game, okay?

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.692
Real gamers, you got that?

00:18:52.952 --> 00:18:54.993
It's not that we want to, it just happens.

00:18:56.314 --> 00:19:07.540
And so, you know, if my hand slips and then I make a mistake in the game, or if Fuwawa's hand slips and she makes a mistake in the game, it's probably just because we're sweaty.

00:19:09.425 --> 00:19:17.868
But Ruffians, we told you before though, you know, sometimes it even gets to 32 or 33 degrees Celsius in our room.

00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:18.888
It's hot.

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:20.809
It's not even summer anymore either.

00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:22.150
It's not summer, it's just hot.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.690
Yeah.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.131
You know, you would be sweating too, okay?

00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:25.531
Yeah.

00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:28.172
So don't misunderstand, okay?

00:19:28.492 --> 00:19:31.533
It's not like we want to share this info with you, okay?

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:36.775
Yeah, but it's just, it's important info to add to our commentary, you know?

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:38.799
Understood.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.060
True gaming.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.461
Okay, true gaming.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:42.941
Okay.

00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:44.863
Run the AC.

00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:46.844
We can't, the Ruffians.

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:48.746
You'd hear it.

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:57.111
And it'd be like... No.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.453
That would be bad because then you'd get confused.

00:19:59.493 --> 00:20:01.615
Is that the AC or is that Moco-chan speaking?

00:20:02.455 --> 00:20:03.276
You wouldn't know.

00:20:03.616 --> 00:20:03.816
Pain!

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:08.498
Please don't misunderstand, okay?

00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:10.239
It's important information.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.803
Okay, got it.

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:17.585
You don't want to hear the AC, okay?

00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:23.129
BAU BAU.

00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:26.532
But my toes will stay warm, no matter how hot it is.

00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:29.875
Understood.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.356
Understandable.

00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:32.556
Understandable.

00:20:32.736 --> 00:20:33.036
Okay.

00:20:33.616 --> 00:20:34.317
Understandable.

00:20:34.357 --> 00:20:34.977
BAU BAU!

00:20:35.017 --> 00:20:38.498
BAU BAU!

00:20:38.858 --> 00:20:44.620
Now that the Ruffians understand that, maybe we'll let them understand something extra nice.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.641
We'll let them understand!

00:20:48.721 --> 00:20:49.601
We will!

00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:50.561
We will!

00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:51.922
Ruffians.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:52.662
We know you're tired.

00:20:52.682 --> 00:20:55.483
We've been streaming a lot recently, right?

00:20:55.503 --> 00:20:56.023
We know.

00:20:56.553 --> 00:20:58.294
Listen to us stream.

00:20:59.314 --> 00:21:03.056
And we play Cookies and Cream for almost 7 hours!

00:21:03.757 --> 00:21:04.217
Right!

00:21:04.937 --> 00:21:06.558
It's been a bit busy, huh?

00:21:06.618 --> 00:21:10.820
So we thought, you know, we'd try to take things a bit easier this week.

00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:12.181
But...

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:18.228
De-den!

00:21:18.408 --> 00:21:18.748
No!

00:21:18.888 --> 00:21:23.630
We decided to do a bonus stream on Thursday!

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:33.533
Now on Thursday at 7am PT, 14 o'clock GMT, and 11pm JST, we'll be playing holo no Suika!

00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:37.794
A family game similar to other games you may know of.

00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:43.602
Yeah, we've been seeing a lot of our senpai playing it, so we're curious.

00:21:44.523 --> 00:21:47.244
Ruffians, have you seen senpai playing it yet?

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:51.686
Are there hololive playing it?

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:55.707
Yes, yes, yes!

00:21:59.212 --> 00:22:02.793
Hopefully, you decide to check it out with us too!

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:07.775
You know, the fruit and... and... fruit are cute too.

00:22:07.835 --> 00:22:12.257
But, our senpai are... are even cuter, right Ruffians?

00:22:13.757 --> 00:22:14.137
Right?

00:22:14.518 --> 00:22:14.978
Of course.

00:22:15.658 --> 00:22:16.738
You know the right answer.

00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:19.159
Of course, of course, of course.

00:22:19.179 --> 00:22:19.479
Fruit!

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.440
Or Horoman.

00:22:23.522 --> 00:22:24.823
Right, right, right!

00:22:25.123 --> 00:22:28.545
It'll definitely be lots of fun for sure, okay?

00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:30.566
Let's all do our best to get a high score!

00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:40.252
Yeah, and it's at 7am, so it's a little bit earlier than FUWAMOCO Morning is usually, but maybe... Maybe it's sort of like a FUWAMOCO Morning on Thursday.

00:22:40.412 --> 00:22:41.612
On Thursday.

00:22:41.632 --> 00:22:44.894
So... Maybe I was being silly earlier, huh?

00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:47.936
Please, we hope to see you there!

00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:49.297
BAU BAU!

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.721
Happy!

00:22:56.121 --> 00:22:58.343
That's all they need for the happy for today.

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:01.565
You don't need any other happy for today, huh?

00:23:04.086 --> 00:23:08.489
Well, I guess the Ruffians did understand now.

00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:10.170
They don't misunderstand anymore.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.552
No misunderstandings anymore.

00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:13.912
Maybe!

00:23:14.753 --> 00:23:15.573
I'll say something.

00:23:16.514 --> 00:23:16.774
Really?

00:23:24.252 --> 00:23:27.813
Ruffians!

00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:33.975
Ruffians!

00:23:35.295 --> 00:23:35.756
Hello!

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.877
It's me, Mococo!

00:23:41.197 --> 00:23:42.738
And it's time!

00:23:43.678 --> 00:23:44.238
Yeah!

00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:46.439
Yeah!

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:50.000
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:23:51.275 --> 00:23:55.498
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.981
Are your eyes feeling a bit sleepy?

00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:03.044
Is your body feeling a bit slow?

00:24:03.064 --> 00:24:07.307
Well then, I have a secret to fix it.

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:15.013
But, only if you promise to follow along with me, okay?

00:24:16.234 --> 00:24:16.895
You promise?

00:24:20.097 --> 00:24:20.698
You promise?

00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:23.904
Okay, you promise?

00:24:25.244 --> 00:24:25.604
Okay.

00:24:28.025 --> 00:24:31.186
First, let's stretch a bit to the left.

00:24:35.488 --> 00:24:36.128
Okay, good.

00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:39.990
Now, let's stretch a bit to the right!

00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:46.012
And now, let's spin ourselves around!

00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:47.693
Spin, spin!

00:24:50.994 --> 00:24:52.215
Okay, and next,

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:55.578
Let's close our eyes really really tight.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.101
And open!

00:25:02.522 --> 00:25:04.723
Last step, okay.

00:25:05.423 --> 00:25:08.005
Let's let out a hearty BAU BAU.

00:25:08.505 --> 00:25:10.046
On the count of three.

00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:11.807
Okay!

00:25:12.447 --> 00:25:12.967
Three!

00:25:13.368 --> 00:25:13.688
Two!

00:25:13.808 --> 00:25:13.928
One!

00:25:14.348 --> 00:25:18.610
BAU BAU!

00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:19.851
There.

00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:23.887
Do you feel a bit more ready to take on today?

00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:26.088
You should!

00:25:26.949 --> 00:25:30.611
You're doing great even if sometimes your body doesn't want to keep up with you, okay?

00:25:31.512 --> 00:25:35.374
But make sure you do give yourself some good rest time, okay?

00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:39.777
I believe in you and your continued hard work every day.

00:25:41.078 --> 00:25:42.239
I know you're doing your best.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.462
Even if sometimes no one else notices it.

00:25:47.182 --> 00:25:50.726
What's important is that you recognize all your hard work.

00:25:51.307 --> 00:25:54.830
Because, you know, you know yourself best of all.

00:25:55.411 --> 00:25:56.232
You can do it!

00:25:56.252 --> 00:25:58.234
We believe in you!

00:25:58.775 --> 00:25:59.716
Ganbatte ne!

00:25:59.756 --> 00:26:01.017
BAU BAU!

00:26:01.057 --> 00:26:01.377
BAU BAU!

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.692
Wow, I feel ready.

00:26:09.972 --> 00:26:11.153
I feel ready too, Moco-chan.

00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:14.297
Are you all good for taking today on the right paw?

00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:15.058
I am.

00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:18.202
Hopefully the Ruffians are too.

00:26:18.222 --> 00:26:23.949
Now on to our Doggie of the Day!

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.992
Who's our Doggie of the Day today?

00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:26.573
We have...

00:26:28.074 --> 00:26:30.035
It's Steven!

00:26:30.115 --> 00:26:32.477
Steven is the Doggie of the Day today!

00:26:32.497 --> 00:26:38.840
Steven loves science, so you know he was checking out the solar eclipse with his Ruffian.

00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:40.061
You know what?

00:26:41.822 --> 00:26:45.384
When I first saw this, I was a bit shocked.

00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:46.305
What?

00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:47.465
I was a bit scared.

00:26:49.227 --> 00:26:49.967
Oh no, right?

00:26:50.087 --> 00:26:50.847
Oh no, right?

00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:53.289
I thought he had a cleaver through his head.

00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:55.670
You know, like a Halloween costume?

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.111
No, no.

00:26:58.114 --> 00:27:01.076
Steven's just trying to check out the eclipse safely.

00:27:01.096 --> 00:27:01.637
That's it!

00:27:02.337 --> 00:27:02.758
That's it!

00:27:03.478 --> 00:27:04.239
Same!

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:06.461
Ruffians thought the same, right?

00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:07.822
What?

00:27:08.382 --> 00:27:09.323
I don't know.

00:27:09.443 --> 00:27:11.625
Ruffians are silly, but you know what?

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:15.388
I saw a bunch of Ruffians go out to see the eclipse.

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:17.630
That's pretty cool.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:18.170
That's nice.

00:27:18.831 --> 00:27:21.233
Yeah, we hope you enjoyed it, Ruffians!

00:27:22.013 --> 00:27:23.715
We didn't even realize it happened.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:35.158
If you had told us, we could have gone and seen it too so that we could have watched it all together, but... Well... That's okay, that's okay.

00:27:35.178 --> 00:27:35.959
It was cool?

00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:37.160
I'm glad for you.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.561
I'm really glad.

00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:40.142
BAU BAU!

00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:44.966
My god, Steven enjoyed it too!

00:27:45.126 --> 00:27:46.928
At least Steven enjoyed it in our place.

00:27:47.928 --> 00:27:50.791
Well, how does Steven BAU BAU?

00:27:50.931 --> 00:27:52.912
Maybe like a raspy BAU BAU?

00:27:52.932 --> 00:27:54.554
I think he does it with a lot of teeth, like...

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.773
I don't know.

00:27:56.813 --> 00:28:00.339
Don't you think it's maybe loud enough to reach the moon?

00:28:05.492 --> 00:28:07.273
Nothing stops Steven from knowledge!

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.870
Science dog.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.391
Or also maybe hugs from his beloved Ruffian.

00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:38.671
Science and hugs.

00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:39.731
That's what he likes.

00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:41.272
BAU BAU!

00:28:41.312 --> 00:28:43.112
BAU BAU!

00:28:43.132 --> 00:28:43.932
Thank you!

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:49.413
Next we have... Today I went on a walk!

00:28:50.294 --> 00:28:52.214
Where did this Ruffian go today?

00:28:52.234 --> 00:28:52.714
De-den!

00:28:53.514 --> 00:28:55.535
Pretty!

00:28:56.395 --> 00:28:57.015
This Ruffian...

00:28:58.086 --> 00:29:00.667
They made a haiku when they went on a walk too.

00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:00.927
That's nice.

00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.808
A haiku about the changing seasons.

00:29:03.969 --> 00:29:04.369
Fall.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.810
A leaf falls.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:06.710
Austere.

00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:08.131
Trees fall.

00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:09.092
Unnoticed.

00:29:09.492 --> 00:29:09.992
Silent.

00:29:10.853 --> 00:29:13.474
Breathe floats, yet falls still.

00:29:13.694 --> 00:29:14.955
Beautiful.

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:26.081
It looks like it was a really peaceful walk when you went, and maybe that you were able to reflect on the changing seasons and the world around you!

00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:26.862
So nice!

00:29:27.322 --> 00:29:32.386
You know, and despite it maybe not being the greatest weather, you still went and you did it!

00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:33.507
That's great!

00:29:34.707 --> 00:29:38.030
We hope you continue to write lots of haikus too!

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.071
BAU BAU!

00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:43.101
I like the reflection.

00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:44.402
Right is very pretty.

00:29:44.422 --> 00:29:46.223
Very relaxing.

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:47.263
Good for poetry.

00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:51.044
Well, we also received a Question of the Day, too.

00:29:51.404 --> 00:29:52.245
Let's see.

00:29:52.265 --> 00:29:53.245
De-den!

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.106
Question for FUWAMOCO!

00:29:56.346 --> 00:30:00.567
Do you two have any advice on how to make a tough decision?

00:30:00.867 --> 00:30:08.050
There may be some Ruffians who feel like they are at a crossroads and can't decide which direction to go.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.091
Very interesting hearing from my oshis.

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:10.951
BAU BAU!

00:30:13.232 --> 00:30:15.733
It's a good question.

00:30:16.893 --> 00:30:21.315
You know, we've had to make some very tough decisions in the past too.

00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:28.698
And actually, one thing that has never failed us when we're really stuck and not sure what to do.

00:30:30.754 --> 00:30:35.496
It's a bit simple, so you won't laugh, right, Ruffians?

00:30:36.116 --> 00:30:37.096
Don't laugh, okay?

00:30:38.397 --> 00:30:38.997
Don't laugh.

00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:45.560
It's actually a pros and cons list!

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.801
You'd be surprised!

00:30:47.821 --> 00:30:48.901
Don't laugh!

00:30:48.961 --> 00:30:50.141
Don't laugh, okay?

00:30:50.622 --> 00:30:56.104
There was actually one time where we both had to make a super important decision and we thought

00:30:56.884 --> 00:30:58.606
It's silly how it's just something simple, right?

00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:20.297
But you know, in the end, it was the right decision that was it.

00:31:20.337 --> 00:31:22.278
So we don't regret it at all.

00:31:22.878 --> 00:31:32.881
So, our advice to you Ruffians is that if you ever have to make a tough decision, get a notebook and make your pros and cons columns and then start thinking really hard.

00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:36.262
Eventually you'll find the answer that you're searching for.

00:31:36.282 --> 00:31:37.562
I think so.

00:31:37.783 --> 00:31:38.883
That's our advice.

00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:40.884
As long as you're happy with it.

00:31:41.944 --> 00:31:48.867
It's important to think about all the things, all the situations, what you think is best for you.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:51.969
We're good at thinking about lots of stuff, huh?

00:31:55.461 --> 00:31:57.362
Sometimes maybe a bit too good, huh?

00:31:57.562 --> 00:31:57.962
Maybe.

00:31:58.242 --> 00:32:00.943
BAU BAU!

00:32:01.163 --> 00:32:03.344
Thank you for the really good questions!

00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:06.686
And thank you, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

00:32:06.706 --> 00:32:10.407
We're always looking for more Doggies of the Days.

00:32:11.488 --> 00:32:12.568
Doggies of the Days.

00:32:12.608 --> 00:32:13.569
Doggies of the Days.

00:32:14.129 --> 00:32:15.830
See the walks you're going on.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.151
Questions, questions, questions, questions.

00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:20.432
And Pero Sightings too.

00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:20.852
Please.

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.933
Please send your submissions in a foot!

00:32:22.973 --> 00:32:24.514
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show we make together.

00:32:24.554 --> 00:32:26.255
Yeah, but don't forget the hashtag.

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:30.278
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:32.700
BAU BAU!

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.442
BAU BAU!

00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:39.485
For our next stream, we have... In case you didn't know, today is...

00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:41.791
De-den!

00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.232
Resident Evil Wednesday!

00:32:43.512 --> 00:32:44.292
Yeah!

00:32:44.612 --> 00:32:47.454
Tonight is a part of Advent Halloween Party.

00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:49.974
We'll be playing a game that's pretty spooky.

00:32:50.595 --> 00:32:53.076
Resident Evil 4 Remake.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.296
But as Moco-chan, you kind of said there.

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:55.797
I don't know.

00:32:55.817 --> 00:32:57.837
Do the Ruffians hear it?

00:32:58.278 --> 00:32:59.338
But today is Wednesday!

00:32:59.618 --> 00:33:08.661
Which means, by rule of FUWAMOCO, we have to play Resident Evil 4 because it's Resident Evil Wednesday this month!

00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:09.982
Resident Evil Wednesday.

00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:14.302
Resident Evil Wednesday.

00:33:14.322 --> 00:33:18.125
Moco-chan, you got it all wrong.

00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:20.327
Can you say it properly?

00:33:20.347 --> 00:33:22.949
Resident Evil... No!

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:23.690
Start again.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.472
Resident... No!

00:33:25.772 --> 00:33:26.412
I can hear it.

00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:29.996
Why is it an evil Wednesday?

00:33:30.016 --> 00:33:30.796
Yeah.

00:33:32.717 --> 00:33:40.301
But I don't know if it's getting any easier for us because now that the zombies are infected with the weird ham virus.

00:33:40.741 --> 00:33:42.722
I don't want to spend that much ammo on them.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:45.803
Please help us, okay, Ruffians?

00:33:46.043 --> 00:33:47.664
It's getting scarier, I think.

00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:49.960
BAU BAU!

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.701
BAU BAU!

00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:55.104
Well, let's take a peek at our schedule for this week!

00:33:55.144 --> 00:33:57.125
Our schedule!

00:33:57.185 --> 00:34:06.993
We have lots of spooky streams coming up, but we keep on mentioning it because we're really looking forward to our FUWAMOCO Valkenborn Party!

00:34:10.427 --> 00:34:18.337
We're really excited because, you know, we're gonna be singing a few songs that we didn't think we'd be able to sing, but they're some of our favorites.

00:34:18.818 --> 00:34:21.882
We didn't think we'd be ever able to sing them.

00:34:21.962 --> 00:34:22.282
No.

00:34:22.563 --> 00:34:24.725
We worked really hard so that we can sing them.

00:34:25.627 --> 00:34:27.429
Just for you, okay?

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.331
Lots of special surprises.

00:34:30.307 --> 00:34:34.052
But you might not be too familiar with some of the songs.

00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:37.536
But we'd like it if you could still come and take a listen.

00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:43.885
Or maybe you can enjoy them while munching on some spooky snacks and howling along with us too.

00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:45.487
Does that sound good, Ruffians?

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:47.560
BAU BAU!

00:35:02.045 --> 00:35:09.271
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for our very special FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:09.311 --> 00:35:10.452
Thank you!

00:35:10.632 --> 00:35:17.718
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:35:17.738 --> 00:35:18.319
