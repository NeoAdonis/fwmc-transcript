00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.709
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.479
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.703 --> 00:05:24.293
I'm not awake, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:24.934
I'm very awake, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:29.181
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:34.487
Half of us is sleepy.

00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:36.089
Half of us isn't.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:36.629
Yes.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.210
Good.

00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:39.272
Yes.

00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:42.796
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.598
BAU BAU!

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:53.028
Thank you for joining us for our 159th episode of FUWAMOCO!

00:05:53.328 --> 00:05:53.548
FUWAMOCO!

00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:53.888
Ruffians!

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.270
I can be just a...

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.872
Awake and hanging in.

00:05:56.892 --> 00:05:59.575
And you can be the awake and ready to conquer the day!

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:00.997
Who's gonna be the host?

00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:02.098
You have to be awake!

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:04.301
Moco-chan is the host.

00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:07.064
I'm awake.

00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:07.385
BAU BAU!

00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:09.607
You know what my hidden secret was?

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:10.929
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:18.438
It was just passing out for a couple minutes and then waking up.

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:21.622
I have lots of dreams so then that counts for a full night's sleep, right?

00:06:22.102 --> 00:06:24.125
Dream corner, Moco-chan!

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:24.345
Oh.

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.470
True, but I sort of forgot them.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.451
I didn't write them down.

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:36.760
But I'm pretty sure that, uh... It was either Nerissa or Gigi, but... I can't remember.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.722
What?

00:06:38.742 --> 00:06:39.583
But what, Moco-chan?

00:06:39.603 --> 00:06:40.224
In my dream!

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:42.387
Huh?

00:06:42.407 --> 00:06:43.228
It was Nerissa.

00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:44.189
And?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.971
Nane-chan.

00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:46.892
Oh, and?

00:06:47.392 --> 00:06:48.093
What happened?

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:48.714
I don't know.

00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:49.675
I can't remember.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:53.892
I think I got in trouble and misunderstood something.

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:56.216
Thanks, Moco-chan.

00:06:56.537 --> 00:06:57.539
You're welcome!

00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:04.452
Well, for those that are joining us for the first time, this is a show about dreams.

00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:10.624
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:12.107
A.k.a.

00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:12.287
FUWAMOCO

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:15.873
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:21.522
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:22.002 --> 00:07:27.231
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:31.477
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:35.203
BAU BAU!

00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:39.999
I'm laughing because this is like the sleepiest you've ever sounded.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.542
Is it?

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:49.111
For those that are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a 24 minute morning show!

00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:56.841
I'm sorry I can't let you sound like that!

00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:59.385
I'm sorry I can't!

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:00.166
FUWAMOCO!

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:00.246
Hi.

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:04.870
Yeah, that was the suggestion, right, Moco-chan?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.250
What?

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:09.455
That'd be the corner where Fuwawa goes home early.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:18.224
The episode where he's like, okay, time for me to leave now, huh?

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:24.951
FUWAMOCO Morning has two hosts, right, Moco-chan?

00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:28.820
BAU BAU!

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.448
And Ruffians, we're gonna start off the day on the right paw today!

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.012
Wait, Moco-chan!

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:41.421
We have some exciting things to share with the Ruffians!

00:08:44.388 --> 00:08:48.473
My photos at breakfast is just like last time, right?

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:50.675
Ruffians like sending us photos at breakfast.

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:51.536
Breakfast photos?

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:52.938
I like that.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.302
This time it's not a breakfast photo.

00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.384
What are you eating for breakfast today, Ruffians?

00:08:58.404 --> 00:08:59.205
This time it's not a breakfast photo!

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.707
I'm just trying to visualize it, okay?

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:02.369
What are you eating?

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.572
You're eating breakfast right now, right?

00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:05.873
I'm eating cucumbers.

00:09:06.308 --> 00:09:07.570
What is breakfast?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.917
Breakfast can be anything that neutralizes your body for the day.

00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:13.157
What?

00:09:13.197 --> 00:09:16.562
Neutralizes?

00:09:16.582 --> 00:09:21.268
Anything that neutralizes your body, okay?

00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:21.889
You should have more than air.

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:22.690
Like a cucumber.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.595
Today is a cucumber kind of day.

00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:27.837
Yes!

00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:29.619
Eggs, avocado, bacon, that's neutralizing.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.641
Yes!

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:30.901
Ah!

00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:31.943
Cucumbers too.

00:09:32.043 --> 00:09:36.008
I think the cucumber will be a very good breakfast today.

00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:36.249
Yes!

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.471
Neutralizing, okay?

00:09:38.993 --> 00:09:42.818
Well, it's FUWAMOCO's breakfast sighting today, Moco-chan.

00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:51.891
Well, um... Unfortunately, it's not breakfast and that's why I feel a bit off already.

00:09:52.073 --> 00:09:53.735
I was looking forward to breakfast.

00:09:53.755 --> 00:10:01.083
I'm not very neutralized by this next... next photo we have to share.

00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:07.371
Is it not a breakfast sighting, Moco-chan?

00:10:07.391 --> 00:10:09.073
It's not a breakfast sighting, it's a Pero sighting!

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:17.322
I thought we could maybe change things up, you know, just look at the ruffians' breakfasts, but... Okay, well it was Pero sighted then, Moco-chan.

00:10:19.613 --> 00:10:22.357
Pero-chan!

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:27.325
It's a computer.

00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:28.667
Computer?

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.310
That's pretty good, even better.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.093
You know computers are strong.

00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:33.915
Yes, maybe he'll like it there.

00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:37.521
This looks like a really cool computer.

00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:40.626
It's a small computer but it also looks like one that maybe has...

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:44.218
Ladies with names of computers in them.

00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:45.921
Ah, old computers, yeah!

00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:49.425
Maybe he can stay there for a long time.

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:50.407
Don't you know?

00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:53.491
What computer is this?

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:54.913
Ruffians, do you know?

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:57.757
I think it's ancient.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:10:59.839
Virus?

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:00.781
Pero's a virus?

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:01.662
I don't know.

00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:05.106
Caramel Pain Pero!

00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:06.208
Windows 98?

00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:07.930
Is it a 98?

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.073
Is this like a laptop?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.983
That's very ancient!

00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:14.925
Ruffians!

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:18.011
I was looking at this.

00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:21.318
I'm thinking, wait, huh?

00:11:21.338 --> 00:11:21.659
Is this?

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.506
Moco-chan, do you remember?

00:11:26.047 --> 00:11:28.332
I didn't remember until you brought it up!

00:11:29.257 --> 00:11:30.799
A WAPRO!

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:33.482
Is it a Japanese word processor?

00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:34.783
WAPRO!

00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:36.385
Is this a WAPRO?

00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:38.047
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:43.293
We learned how to type in Japanese with a WAPRO as part of our Japanese lessons!

00:11:43.313 --> 00:11:50.962
And I forgot about that until... 10 minutes ago.

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:51.883
I've used a WAPRO before!

00:11:52.684 --> 00:11:56.749
I'm not too sure exactly what a WAPRO is versus just a...

00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:59.276
A laptop computer.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:00.617
A word processor.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.301
Everything's a word processor, right?

00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:07.785
Yes, so then what exactly is a word processor, right?

00:12:07.805 --> 00:12:10.347
I don't know, but I like old computers.

00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:13.711
I don't really get them, but you can play old games on them.

00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.594
Right, and you know, it kind of takes you back to a different world.

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:20.697
I don't know what would be a word processor.

00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:21.759
Maybe Pero's lucky.

00:12:21.859 --> 00:12:23.260
Right.

00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:26.096
Yeah, but you can stay in there.

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:27.438
Ask Inaz!

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:28.580
She's a waburo!

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.007
That was a really good one.

00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:33.928
I like that a lot.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.395
Yeah, but I do have one thing to say.

00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:40.940
I think your computer is dead.

00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:42.021
Maybe.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:43.804
It doesn't matter.

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:48.572
It can't do anything anymore, be it games, word pricing.

00:12:49.801 --> 00:13:09.227
Speaking of a waffle... It was her birthday and she celebrated it with a feety birthday concert!

00:13:09.207 --> 00:13:34.945
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:13:38.013 --> 00:13:42.157
I'm sure that was the intention, huh?

00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:42.538
Right, right!

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:43.258
It's super duper cute!

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:47.222
It's Ina-senpai's hero outfit!

00:13:47.242 --> 00:13:49.184
Yeah, she definitely looks like a hero.

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:53.609
It's really cute!

00:13:53.709 --> 00:14:03.859
But in their performances, you know, she had amazing, amazing songs sung together with Akirose-senpai!

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:03.999
Shari!

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:06.342
It was really nice, you know, seeing the two of them dancing.

00:14:06.362 --> 00:14:07.783
Ina-senpai...

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:10.010
Shaking and swaying like that.

00:14:11.895 --> 00:14:18.534
You know, a song together with Peri-senpai and then with Watame-senpai and Botan-senpai too.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.440
Unfortunately.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:32.352
We had to dash away with coins or we had things that we needed to get done and things that were calling us right away.

00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:33.996
We were not happy about this.

00:14:34.016 --> 00:14:38.445
I was not happy and especially so because

00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:47.494
Only later did I find out that Ina-senpai, she sung one of my favorite songs!

00:14:47.514 --> 00:14:47.594
Yes!

00:14:47.614 --> 00:14:48.595
Yes, did you know it?

00:14:48.615 --> 00:14:52.078
Yeah, it's from Nature Plus' visual mode, Rawr Chorus.

00:14:52.098 --> 00:14:52.178
Yes!

00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:58.484
And it's sung originally by Ina Kaneko, and I just, I couldn't believe it!

00:14:58.584 --> 00:14:59.565
It's one of my favorite Ina Kaneko songs!

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:03.929
I always sing it at karaoke, and I don't think anybody knows about this song!

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:04.910
Yes!

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.812
Because we were trying to get...

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:10.379
Karaoke part for over a year, yes!

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:13.726
But all this, Ina-senpai, she sung it for me, right?

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:14.568
Yes.

00:15:14.588 --> 00:15:15.690
You thought nobody knows?

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:16.933
No!

00:15:17.153 --> 00:15:19.138
That's- it's because she did it for me.

00:15:19.358 --> 00:15:20.100
Yeah.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.503
She did it for me.

00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:22.725
It was just for us, okay?

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:28.717
You know, I really really wonder, you know, why did she chose it?

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:30.280
Where did she hear it first?

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.103
I wanna know!

00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:34.448
You need to learn!

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:34.648
Right!

00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:36.111
It made me super duper happy!

00:15:36.432 --> 00:15:43.646
I'm so so surprised and I hope that maybe, maybe one day we can sing it for you, Ruffians, during a Rock n' Rawr Party too!

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:44.207
Yeah, hopefully.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.766
You're surprised too!

00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:52.976
If only I was there.

00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:57.345
If only I was there live, Ruffians.

00:15:57.365 --> 00:16:02.154
You would've heard it.

00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:04.018
Still so surprised!

00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:08.686
But it was wonderful.

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:14.071
And a big happy birthday to Ina-senpai!

00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:14.251
BAU BAU!

00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:16.073
BAU BAU!

00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:19.596
And more myth news!

00:16:19.616 --> 00:16:19.776
Yes!

00:16:20.197 --> 00:16:25.381
Kiara-senpai, she just shared a brand new video of her original song, Perfume!

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.124
A dance show edition choreography!

00:16:28.144 --> 00:16:34.309
Just before she released the music video that was very, very, wow, stylish.

00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:36.673
Fashionable!

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:38.316
Fashion icon Kiara-senpai!

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:44.507
But this time, you can get a very close look at the dance formations.

00:16:44.527 --> 00:16:51.800
And Kiara-senpai, of course there's Kiara-senpai, but there's also six other background dancers!

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.884
And Miyuki-sensei did the choreography too!

00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:57.873
So we hope that you'll go check it out.

00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:00.219
Get us a bite of her perfume out there.

00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:03.046
But then, doing her best all together.

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:03.808
Seven!

00:17:03.868 --> 00:17:07.097
Seven dancers.

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:08.520
Six dancers plus herself.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.084
Seven.

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:11.446
That's how math works.

00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:15.053
You know, I just, I love Kiara-senpai.

00:17:15.173 --> 00:17:22.085
Her style, you know, her kind of sound that she has in the musical form and I love it too.

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:24.950
Please go watch it and check it out in close depth.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.352
I guess.

00:17:26.372 --> 00:17:27.514
In close depth, Moco-chan.

00:17:27.534 --> 00:17:28.596
Yes.

00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:31.619

Hi

00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:59.964
Autofister.

00:17:59.984 --> 00:18:00.485
There is two song covers!

00:18:00.505 --> 00:18:00.705
Autofister!

00:18:01.026 --> 00:18:02.027
Turing Love.

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:05.372
Turing Love over on Cece's Channel.

00:18:05.553 --> 00:18:06.474
Have you listened?

00:18:06.855 --> 00:18:08.778
It's so cute, so happy.

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.762
Can't not smile, you know.

00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:14.706
And the illustrations and everything too!

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:18.091
Just gonna make a video too!

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:22.096
Yeah, you listen, both were so good exactly!

00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:29.306
Both, because not just two of them, but also Naimono Nedari on Gigi's channel!

00:18:29.827 --> 00:18:35.775
I really love it, you know, you can kind of see two different dynamics of them both really well.

00:18:35.755 --> 00:18:38.000
D-Boy Cece.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.410
I don't know. Naimono Nedari,

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.679
I always think it's a different song.

00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:49.084
It's not very popular.

00:18:49.104 --> 00:18:52.752
This one's the popular one, Moco-chan.

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:54.535
But please check it out.

00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:57.520
It's very nice to hear them singing in Japanese too, you know?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:04.613
So you're like, oh, I've heard them, you know, maybe, uh, uh, you know, Gigi sung that song a lot of times, right?

00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:08.380
You know, this is maybe a little bit different from that.

00:19:08.961 --> 00:19:12.006
Yeah, that one song a lot of times.

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:29.978
BAU BAU!

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.981
Wow!

00:19:32.001 --> 00:19:33.523
We have a new corner!

00:19:33.543 --> 00:19:38.951
A new corner that we're excited to presen- I'm not excited.

00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:40.393
I want to be surprised at this.

00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:42.997
This show has a new corner, huh?

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.562
What's the corner?

00:19:46.582 --> 00:19:47.063
What's the corner?

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:47.143
Oh!

00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:50.949
It's the Biboo accident corner.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.352
Biboo accident.

00:19:55.916 --> 00:19:56.016
Yeah.

00:19:56.755 --> 00:19:58.217
Biboo!

00:19:58.237 --> 00:19:59.599
Biboo!

00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:04.386
She found herself in a bit of trouble recently apparently.

00:20:04.406 --> 00:20:05.508
In a bit of trouble!

00:20:05.668 --> 00:20:06.830
Yes!

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.455
Apparently, well Biboo, she was away for a little bit.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:18.747
But while she was away, apparently, she fell in the gap between the train and the platform.

00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:20.942
Poor Biboo!

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:27.854
And maybe Ruffians, if you haven't been to Japan before, you're like, okay, well, um, this is a tiny gap, right?

00:20:28.475 --> 00:20:31.039
Sometimes it is not a tiny gap!

00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:31.981
A big gap!

00:20:32.842 --> 00:20:34.685
And Biboo is tiny!

00:20:34.825 --> 00:20:42.338
The thing is, Ruffians, we have told Biboo to be careful of the gap.

00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:58.200
FUWAMOCO

00:20:58.501 --> 00:21:02.908
I've fallen in the GAP before too, Ruffians!

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.031
But it wasn't my fault!

00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:05.432
It wasn't my fault!

00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:06.834
That's why we know you have to be careful.

00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:09.378
The GAP is very dangerous.

00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:13.765
Fuwawa has already done it, so we told her the story, and that's why she should have fallen in!

00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:15.167
I didn't do it though, see?

00:21:15.347 --> 00:21:17.691
You know, there's a mining densha, you know, that really packs a punch.

00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:40.000
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:53.838
I think we need to go over and see how Biboo's doing because it's very scary and she's probably very ouch.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:55.321
Very ouch.

00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:57.685
It sounds funny after but...

00:21:57.665 --> 00:21:59.147
It is very frightening.

00:21:59.648 --> 00:22:02.171
She is probably quite, you know, bruised up.

00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:13.607
So please, when you come to Japan, if you come to Japan, please be careful for the gout because it changes depending on what train and what station you're at.

00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:15.410
Sometimes it can be very very big.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.892
We have some band-aids.

00:22:17.312 --> 00:22:18.875
The thing is, we already have!

00:22:19.275 --> 00:22:22.540
We bought her 20 band-aids and we gave them to her!

00:22:23.161 --> 00:22:24.162
It's all...

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:45.205
Thank you for watching!

00:22:46.197 --> 00:22:48.682
Yeah, Biboo had a bad week.

00:22:50.706 --> 00:22:57.680
Hopefully this was just one unpleasant thing and that there was a lot of other really, really good things going on.

00:22:58.141 --> 00:22:59.444
But we'll see.

00:22:59.464 --> 00:23:04.574
We'll mess with Biboo.

00:23:04.594 --> 00:23:04.754
BAU BAU!

00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:05.396
Get better soon, Biboo!

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:06.518
Bruises go away fast.

00:23:07.274 --> 00:23:09.617
I'm praying, I'm praying.

00:23:09.637 --> 00:23:12.300
Sometimes, you know, you get a scratch and you're like, how did that get there?

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.203
And then it never disappears for a long time, huh?

00:23:16.284 --> 00:23:19.388
Sometimes it's just like that.

00:23:19.408 --> 00:23:20.129
BAU BAU.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.111
Oh, Ruffians!

00:23:22.131 --> 00:23:25.615
We have another new corner that we're excited to present to you!

00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:30.721
We have Nerissa-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:32.163
Is that the sound of Nerissa-dun?

00:23:32.183 --> 00:23:34.986
It's a theme song.

00:23:34.966 --> 00:23:38.152
Wow!

00:23:38.172 --> 00:23:38.533
It's Nerissa news!

00:23:38.553 --> 00:23:39.655
Nerissa has some exciting news!

00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:45.026
She released a brand new cover that you can find on streaming services!

00:23:45.046 --> 00:23:50.157
Titled The Boy is Mine by Ariana Grande.

00:23:50.898 --> 00:23:55.287
Wow, it's a very Nerissa song.

00:23:55.891 --> 00:23:58.014
Makes your heart flutter a little bit.

00:23:58.034 --> 00:23:59.476
I've never heard this song before.

00:24:00.037 --> 00:24:01.339
No, it's Nerissa's song.

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:01.919
I don't know.

00:24:01.939 --> 00:24:04.223
I don't know who this Ariana Grande person is.

00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:11.893
But... If you haven't checked it out, please go check it out!

00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:16.119
She's a demon of song for a reason, Ruffian.

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:19.063
It's nice that she keeps on releasing all these covers.

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:22.107
Why?

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:22.207
Why?

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:22.708
Why?

00:24:28.443 --> 00:24:29.364
Grand day.

00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:31.287
Grand day to you!

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.032
That's what it sounds like.

00:24:34.052 --> 00:24:35.214
Have a grand day!

00:24:36.235 --> 00:24:36.456
Fine!

00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:39.060
Vey, vey cheerful.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.300
Ground?

00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:43.747
I, I, I don't... Grand... Ground day?

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:44.168
Wow!

00:24:44.188 --> 00:24:44.809
This song is important!

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:45.390
The point is mine!

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:46.532
Please check it out.

00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:49.035
That's the important message.

00:24:49.055 --> 00:24:49.296
But!

00:24:49.316 --> 00:24:49.656
That's not it!

00:24:49.676 --> 00:24:50.638
No, that's not because!

00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:51.199
We're gonna end it there.

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.202
Oh, no, I wasn't gonna end it there.

00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:58.650
In the big big news!

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:05.303
Nerissa is going to be having a 3D musical concert coming up very soon!

00:25:05.644 --> 00:25:07.568
The title is Requiem for a Love.

00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:10.955
It's Nerissa's very first 3D performance!

00:25:10.995 --> 00:25:13.620
It's going to be on May 24th!

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:23.209
It'll be on May 24th at 6.30pm CST!

00:25:24.911 --> 00:25:27.934
On the 25th at 8.30am JST!

00:25:28.795 --> 00:25:29.435
Look at this!

00:25:29.536 --> 00:25:31.718
Look at this illustration here!

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.720
And it is a jukebox musical.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.382
I don't know what a jukebox musical is, but it's a musical.

00:25:37.784 --> 00:25:39.305
Yeah 3D!

00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:40.527
Looking forward to it!

00:25:40.547 --> 00:25:40.807
Watch along!

00:25:41.508 --> 00:25:42.949
I wish...

00:25:43.537 --> 00:25:45.885
That's a demon of sound there.

00:25:46.287 --> 00:25:48.370
Alright!

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.835
We'll be cheering on Nerissa a bunch!

00:25:51.855 --> 00:25:53.197
I can't wait to watch it!

00:25:53.477 --> 00:25:54.919
Of course, you know where to go.

00:25:54.939 --> 00:25:56.902
Go to Nerissa's channel, okay?

00:25:57.603 --> 00:26:00.027
She provides tickets to everybody, so.

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:01.990
Everybody has a ticket.

00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:03.592
Including you too!

00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:07.137
So make sure that on May 25th, okay?

00:26:08.058 --> 00:26:10.902
I'll be there!

00:26:10.922 --> 00:26:12.505
And congrats Nerissa!

00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:12.845
Congratulations!

00:26:12.865 --> 00:26:14.067
See you in the concert of BAU BAU!

00:26:14.047 --> 00:26:16.936
Yeah, you're all invited, exactly!

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.105
Yeah, it's very funny taking notes, she does it.

00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:21.890
She just hands them out.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:22.873
No verification.

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:25.280
Just throw them to the wind.

00:26:26.183 --> 00:26:28.309
Yeah, birds do think differently, it's okay.

00:26:29.386 --> 00:26:33.372
Demon guards only have to make sure that the rules are followed.

00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:34.093
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:39.181
BAU BAU!

00:26:40.443 --> 00:26:41.826
I'm looking forward to it.

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:43.288
Showtime itsu?

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:47.895
Niijuu-go-nichi no asa hachi-ji sajuu-pun kara hajimarimasu.

00:26:47.915 --> 00:26:53.204
Yes, it's from the very beginning of the morning in Japan.

00:26:53.224 --> 00:26:54.105
Fuwamoco will be awake.

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:55.427
Of course.

00:26:59.103 --> 00:27:01.567
BAU BAU!

00:27:01.587 --> 00:27:01.888
BAU BAU!

00:27:01.928 --> 00:27:02.809
So many new corners today!

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.470
Right!

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.011
Right!

00:27:04.031 --> 00:27:05.714
Is it because it's a new day, Ruffians?

00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:10.803
You only want new corners, though, not old corners.

00:27:10.823 --> 00:27:13.327
I want old corners, too!

00:27:13.347 --> 00:27:14.429
Right, Ruffians?

00:27:20.278 --> 00:27:21.280
Oh, okay.

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:24.832
Don't even need to say anything to the Ruffians.

00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:26.414
The Ruffians already start begging.

00:27:26.454 --> 00:27:27.855
Moco-chan.

00:27:28.095 --> 00:27:29.597
Hi, are you begging?

00:27:31.739 --> 00:27:32.080
Hi.

00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:37.486
Right, let's give the Ruffians a book.

00:27:38.286 --> 00:27:43.552
Yes!

00:27:43.572 --> 00:27:50.179
Well, I guess so then.

00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:51.621
Ruffians!

00:27:52.715 --> 00:27:53.996
Ruffians!

00:27:58.001 --> 00:27:59.342
It's today!

00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:02.485
The middle of the week!

00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:08.772
So that means it's time for another FUWAMOCO Pup Talk!

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:13.857
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:28:13.877 --> 00:28:14.098
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:14.118 --> 00:28:14.718
Ruffians!

00:28:15.879 --> 00:28:16.660
How are you doing?

00:28:18.722 --> 00:28:20.224
You feeling energized?

00:28:22.313 --> 00:28:22.734
Hi!

00:28:24.937 --> 00:28:25.338
Awake?

00:28:25.898 --> 00:28:27.421
Are you awake?

00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:28.022
Sleepy?

00:28:28.583 --> 00:28:29.444
Could be better.

00:28:30.445 --> 00:28:30.806
Yeah?

00:28:32.008 --> 00:28:33.650
You feeling energized?

00:28:34.592 --> 00:28:35.273
Yeah!

00:28:37.376 --> 00:28:37.516
FUWAWA!

00:28:38.077 --> 00:28:39.700
Are you feeling energized?

00:28:43.586 --> 00:28:44.507
Yeah!

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:46.220
Wow!

00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:48.864
Let's get pumped up again!

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:50.726
Hyped up all together!

00:28:51.547 --> 00:28:52.068
Yeah!

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.591
Yeah!

00:28:56.093 --> 00:28:56.754
Ruffians!

00:28:57.335 --> 00:29:00.039
You'll say yes after every sentence here, okay?

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:01.340
Yeah?

00:29:03.243 --> 00:29:03.563
Yeah?

00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:06.327
Promise?

00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:08.062
Okay!

00:29:08.803 --> 00:29:10.145
Here we go again!

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:12.147
Ruffians!

00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:14.210
You work hard!

00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:17.494
You do your best!

00:29:19.376 --> 00:29:21.759
You make mistakes and that's okay!

00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:25.504
We keep learning everyday!

00:29:25.844 --> 00:29:29.329
FUWAMOCO does their best too!

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.535
You care about FUWAMOCO!

00:29:34.735 --> 00:29:36.938
FUWAMOCO cares about you!

00:29:37.728 --> 00:29:38.088
Huh?

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.632
BAU BAU!

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:41.313
Yeah!

00:29:41.894 --> 00:29:43.876
Have another amazing day, Ruffians!

00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:45.078
You can conquer it!

00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:46.300
I believe!

00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:48.402
Ganbatte de!

00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:50.485
BAU BAU!

00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:54.531
BAU BAU!

00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.174
Ruffians are definitely energized now, right?

00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:58.676
I'm awake.

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:00.298
You should be because you screamed a lot.

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:01.159
I'm awake!

00:30:02.221 --> 00:30:03.803
I'm awake already because

00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:08.396
It's the Doggie of the Day!

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:10.600
It's the Doggie of the Day today, huh?

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.145
We have... De-den!

00:30:14.487 --> 00:30:18.936
We have Porcha!

00:30:18.956 --> 00:30:20.359
Porcha's the Doggie of the Day!

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:20.599
Porcha!

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:21.120
BAU BAU!

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.204
She has shiny eyes!

00:30:23.224 --> 00:30:24.987
Little porky ears too!

00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:26.871
A little nose with ghosts!

00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:32.080
You know, Po-chan is a sassy baby boy.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.604
You don't even have to tell me, the nose wrinkles say everything.

00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.227
Right, right, very sassy.

00:30:36.728 --> 00:30:39.593
And look at the toy Po-chan has too!

00:30:39.613 --> 00:30:40.294
Can you see it?

00:30:40.314 --> 00:30:40.955
There are beads!

00:30:42.097 --> 00:30:43.560
That's not a chew toy, right?

00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:47.687
It's definitely not, right?

00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:48.488
Right?

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:52.970
Chillin' okay, Po-chan?

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.852
As long as it's, you know, just a hug.

00:30:55.313 --> 00:30:56.875
Not like a hug in the mouth.

00:30:57.115 --> 00:30:58.597
Not a snack.

00:30:58.777 --> 00:31:03.743
Moco-chan, hi there, Po-chan.

00:31:03.763 --> 00:31:04.564
BAU BAU!

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:05.685
Hi.

00:31:07.127 --> 00:31:12.213
I think Po-chan sounds like... BAU BAU!

00:31:12.233 --> 00:31:13.835
BAU BAU!

00:31:13.855 --> 00:31:14.296
BAU BAU!

00:31:14.316 --> 00:31:16.439
I can definitely hear the sauciness in there.

00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:18.441
BAU BAU!

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:21.029
BAU BAU!

00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:23.633
Yeah, that's Po-chan.

00:31:24.955 --> 00:31:30.784
Yeah, Po-chan, you know, maybe a little saucy, but that's just a little bit, you know?

00:31:30.804 --> 00:31:31.565
That's the attitude!

00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:34.650
You know, it just has a big heart!

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.052
A big, big heart!

00:31:36.372 --> 00:31:37.474
I know!

00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:40.338
I was watching our streams together with this Ruffian!

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:44.344
And I... It doesn't have Fuwawa as a chutoi.

00:31:44.932 --> 00:31:45.594
Yeah.

00:31:45.614 --> 00:31:49.805
You know, I know it's cute, but it just means that Pocha's Fuwawa-oshi.

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:50.406
Ah, maybe.

00:31:52.592 --> 00:31:57.544
But you know, I think more than anything though, Pocha loves his Ruffian.

00:31:57.725 --> 00:31:59.329
Absolutely loves.

00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:05.289
FUWAMOCO 2K!

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:05.650
BAU BAU!

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.872
Thank you!

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:10.800
And for today, I went on a walk!

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.565
Ruffians, what have you been heading off to, huh?

00:32:14.387 --> 00:32:16.912
We have... De-den!

00:32:19.276 --> 00:32:20.278
It's a nice view.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:23.865
Yeah, nice getting out there between all the nasty weather.

00:32:25.347 --> 00:32:27.129
It's beautiful.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.190
The sky!

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.753
I can't believe it's already getting so gold.

00:32:30.773 --> 00:32:31.173
Right!

00:32:32.695 --> 00:32:33.836
Is it hot there?

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:34.877
Is that right?

00:32:35.558 --> 00:32:36.298
One more time.

00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:41.624
Well, it's already gotten really, really hot here in Tokyo.

00:32:42.645 --> 00:32:44.547
All of a sudden, so you know, I can't believe it.

00:32:45.028 --> 00:32:47.370
Me neither.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.913
Very aesthetic, very aesthetic, you know.

00:32:50.914 --> 00:32:53.076
Pretty and hot, very hot.

00:32:53.579 --> 00:33:11.385
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:14.275
BAU BAU!

00:33:14.295 --> 00:33:14.776
Nature!

00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:16.258
Ruffians, that was our experience with nature!

00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:18.401
There was a spider as well.

00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:21.826
BAU BAU BAU!

00:33:21.846 --> 00:33:23.408
Thank you for sharing your FUWAMOCO with us!

00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:25.812
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:33:25.832 --> 00:33:29.998
Today's question is... De-den!

00:33:30.018 --> 00:33:32.041
Do you guys like bubble tea?

00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:33.663
What is your favorite order?

00:33:34.364 --> 00:33:35.405
Favorite order though!

00:33:35.425 --> 00:33:37.188
Can you imagine if we said now?

00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:37.909
Bubble tea!

00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:41.013
Milk tea!

00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:41.214
Milk tea!

00:33:41.234 --> 00:33:41.414
Milk tea!

00:33:41.434 --> 00:33:41.815
Milk tea!

00:33:41.835 --> 00:33:42.115
Milk tea!

00:33:42.095 --> 00:34:03.428
Coconut Jelly Dollar.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.271
Ah, I like it.

00:34:05.692 --> 00:34:10.020
You know, but bubble tea is just so much fun for my friends.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.380
Yeah.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.903
So you know.

00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:13.906
I've never had it.

00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.008
You have to try it then.

00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:16.010
It's just really yummy.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.553
Coconut jelly, yeah.

00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:18.635
Yeah, coconut jelly is good too.

00:34:18.655 --> 00:34:19.777
Jelly that's like coconut.

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.960
And normal pearls is always good too.

00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:22.161
Right.

00:34:22.742 --> 00:34:24.846
But jellies and boba feel weird.

00:34:24.866 --> 00:34:25.727
I get that.

00:34:25.787 --> 00:34:28.231
But sometimes it works, you know.

00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:28.572
It's like...

00:34:29.547 --> 00:34:32.032
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:32.412 --> 00:34:46.037
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:46.253 --> 00:34:47.775
Now it's the words.

00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:50.078
I always feel conflicted.

00:34:50.098 --> 00:34:52.281
But it's bubble tea, feel happy!

00:34:52.301 --> 00:34:54.063
It doesn't have to be that serious!

00:34:54.223 --> 00:34:59.731
But, you know, I hope that maybe one day we can share bubble teas all together in Advent!

00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:07.841
The rest of all, you know, just all like, in a summertime sunset, be like, yeah, it was a fun day here at the bubble tea!

00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:10.164
Get bubble tea together, you know, walk home.

00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:11.706
Walk home!

00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:13.729
In the sunset.

00:35:13.709 --> 00:35:20.425
FUWAMOCO, we like bubble tea, but also Mama Puppy likes bubble tea too!

00:35:20.826 --> 00:35:26.520
You know, sometimes we'd have it together as a treat when we're young, even when dogs too!

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.209
Good memories!

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:31.532
BAU BAU!

00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:33.194
FUWAMOCO!

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:34.616
You've had it before you think!

00:35:34.636 --> 00:35:37.920
You know it's a tease and it has like the pearls.

00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.523
What about Papa Puppy?

00:35:39.943 --> 00:35:41.766
Papa Puppy's not interested in that.

00:35:41.966 --> 00:35:43.268
Not sweet taste.

00:35:43.488 --> 00:35:45.250
FUWAMOCO!

00:35:46.392 --> 00:35:47.173

We're always looking for more questions!

00:35:57.566 --> 00:36:00.270
Don't give the days away!

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.593

So, please let us know with the hashtag, okay?

00:36:06.158 --> 00:36:08.542

00:36:08.562 --> 00:36:08.982
Thank you, Abyssgard!

00:36:10.064 --> 00:36:14.189
And we have another stream coming up soon.

00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:18.135
We have De-den!

00:36:18.215 --> 00:36:20.038
Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:36:20.598 --> 00:36:22.902
This was the question question question mark on our schedule.

00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:24.604
No, it wasn't.

00:36:25.782 --> 00:36:29.971
Why would we hide Donkey Kong Country 2 from you, huh?

00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:30.071
Why?

00:36:30.432 --> 00:36:35.102
Like we said, things are up in the air and they were up in the air and they never came back down.

00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:37.387
Someone play Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:39.752
What was the original plan?

00:36:40.854 --> 00:36:42.137
We had to say the question, question, question mark.

00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:43.179
BAU BAU!

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:47.205
But, we're gonna have a bunch of fun in the Mocchi-Con country too.

00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:49.168
We got really really fired last time.

00:36:49.408 --> 00:36:50.209
We haven't saved.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.293
The stats is just fiddling.

00:36:53.114 --> 00:36:56.359
You know, just on and just going ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka the whole time.

00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:59.123
It'll be fine because we need to save.

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:00.766
Otherwise we're in trouble.

00:37:01.046 --> 00:37:02.368
So let's hope that the stats is still working.

00:37:02.388 --> 00:37:04.271
Because we didn't save before we... Right?

00:37:04.311 --> 00:37:07.416
We got too excited and we went on to the next world and we forgot to save.

00:37:07.396 --> 00:37:09.403
Exactly, now we gotta beat this level.

00:37:09.443 --> 00:37:10.708
We only have so many lives.

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:13.157
Kind of in a tricky spot, but I'm confident.

00:37:13.197 --> 00:37:14.341
Moco-chan, you're confident!

00:37:15.545 --> 00:37:17.372
Ruffians, you're confident!

00:37:23.073 --> 00:37:24.494
You can do it!

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:38.527
You can do it!

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.790
Yes!

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:53.080
BAU BAU!

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.124
Let's have fun!

00:37:55.144 --> 00:37:55.805
We'll be in Boston.

00:37:56.046 --> 00:38:01.816
This is the first super karaoke party ever happening here in 3D.

00:38:01.837 --> 00:38:03.059
I'm super duper excited.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.365
I'm practicing, preparing lots.

00:38:06.465 --> 00:38:08.349
I'm excited to share with the Ruffians.

00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:10.613
I'm a little bit nervous about that one song.

00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:18.452
That's so... Wait, I wanna buy this, you know, chilling doing karaoke together.

00:38:19.033 --> 00:38:22.859
It'll be like a silly, silly... Super karaoke party?

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.561
Yeah.

00:38:24.621 --> 00:38:26.484
Rock n' Rawr Party, super karaoke party.

00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:30.611
Yeah, that one song we haven't sung yet before.

00:38:31.091 --> 00:38:33.495
That's so...

00:38:33.475 --> 00:38:39.683
We're looking forward to seeing a bunch of Ruffians and BALLISTERS!

00:38:39.703 --> 00:38:39.863
BAU BAU!

00:38:39.883 --> 00:38:40.984
And that's our schedule!

00:38:41.004 --> 00:38:54.381
And then on Sunday the 25th of May, early at 6am PT, kind of like an early FUWAMOCO Morning, but on a Sunday, we're gonna be having a collab together with Roboco-senpai, Towa-senpai, Bae-senpai, Hajime, and Vivi!

00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:56.744
And we'll play R.E.P.O.!

00:38:56.764 --> 00:38:59.167
This is a first for a lot of us, huh?

00:38:59.427 --> 00:39:02.571
I think we haven't really collabed together like this.

00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:21.538
FUWAMOCO!

00:39:21.518 --> 00:39:24.341
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:32.609
After the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... It's BAU BAU Musical!

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:35.432
BAU BAU!

00:39:35.732 --> 00:39:40.397
Thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:46.924
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:39:46.964 --> 00:39:48.285
Ashin!

00:39:48.425 --> 00:39:49.146
BAU BAU!

00:39:49.126 --> 00:40:06.291

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
