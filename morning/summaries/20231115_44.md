## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([14:09](https://youtu.be/SFB8O55DTNw?t=14m09s))

Today's misunderstanding that broke their no-misunderstanding streak comes from their [Fashion Dreamer stream](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=1293), when Fuwawa said: "if you massage this, it will be bigger"; Moco-chan had to clarify she meant "the eyes".

Also from their Fashion Dreamer stream: Mococo is concerned that Fuwawa just [CAN'T](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=3830s). [STOP](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=4704). [TOUCHING](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=7800). [THE](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=10360). [MONITOR](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=10568), and she might just break the screen at some point.

## üö® Incident ([19:57](https://youtu.be/SFB8O55DTNw?t=19m57s))

Just before their [Metal Gear Solid stream](https://youtu.be/KarLzbs9N5Y), FUWAMOCO discovered that their PS2 Memory Card was incompatible with PS1 games, meaning that they wouldn't be able to save. Papa puppy brought them a PS1 Memory Card mid-stream! Alas, it was full already, and the PS2 refused to recognize it to delete save blocks and make space for new saves. Unless they find a working memory card before their next PS2 stream, they'll lose their progress.

[@antid0m0](https://twitter.com/antid0m0/status/1724274238029275229) asks: do FUWAMOCO use their human ears to listen? Short answer: they're just decorative. Refer to [ep. 2](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=1573) for a different take on a similar question!
