05:11.570 --> 05:14.031
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:14.051 --> 05:17.933
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.953 --> 05:21.835
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.895 --> 05:23.776
BAU BAU!

05:24.476 --> 05:27.057
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:27.577 --> 05:30.138
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:30.298 --> 05:32.059
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:32.119 --> 05:33.220
BAU BAU!

05:35.121 --> 05:37.964
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.345 --> 05:43.589
Thank you ruffians for being here, waking up early for our 34th episode!

05:43.810 --> 05:44.490
BAU BAU!

05:51.577 --> 05:58.020
I saw there was a couple ruffians saying that maybe this was their first time watching live today.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.221
Or their first time watching in a long time.

06:00.241 --> 06:05.024
Which reminds you, FUWAMOCO- It's a very serious matter.

06:05.044 --> 06:06.704
Very serious, okay?

06:07.105 --> 06:07.985
Make sure you get it.

06:08.145 --> 06:09.586
No misunderstandings, okay?

06:10.006 --> 06:17.254
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, today, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:17.274 --> 06:17.975
A.K.A.

06:18.095 --> 06:19.117
FUWAMOCO!

06:19.517 --> 06:22.420
And is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:22.841 --> 06:28.187
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:30.469 --> 06:36.212
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:36.652 --> 06:40.774
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:40.954 --> 06:45.036
BAU BAU!

06:45.917 --> 06:47.778
Ruffians, how are you feeling today?

06:49.078 --> 06:49.839
You're feeling... Awake.

06:50.059 --> 06:50.499
Excited.

06:50.779 --> 06:51.140
Awake.

06:51.180 --> 06:51.740
Frightened.

06:54.301 --> 06:56.502
There was a Pero Sighting?

06:56.582 --> 06:56.702
Oi!

06:57.183 --> 06:57.643
I see you.

06:58.717 --> 07:00.138
Hopefully not a very scary one.

07:00.158 --> 07:00.798
Not a scary one.

07:00.818 --> 07:01.638
Not a vicious one.

07:01.799 --> 07:02.459
No vicious.

07:03.119 --> 07:03.539
Let's see.

07:04.200 --> 07:04.760
De-den!

07:05.781 --> 07:08.842
A special flying dog?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.984
This is a bit of a surprising sighting.

07:12.024 --> 07:12.544
Right!

07:13.024 --> 07:17.286
Pero just swooped on in and started staring at you deliously.

07:19.107 --> 07:21.909
You better do something before he messes with your plants.

07:21.929 --> 07:23.690
You don't want him to push them over, right?

07:23.710 --> 07:26.371
You know, I have a few little succulents.

07:26.772 --> 07:30.854
And I always have to keep an eye on Pero so he doesn't do anything to them too, you know?

07:31.634 --> 07:34.356
But you know, there's the owl plant, right?

07:34.376 --> 07:35.817
FUWAMOCO-chan's plant.

07:35.877 --> 07:38.658
Yeah, and succulents can look pretty yummy too, right?

07:38.678 --> 07:46.463
You know, Pero keeps on saying that if I'm not careful he's gonna take a big bite out of them.

07:47.694 --> 07:51.197
So, hopefully, he doesn't do anything like that to your butt.

07:51.297 --> 07:52.158
Okay?

07:52.519 --> 08:00.166
But you know, the joke's on him, cause if he does, he'll just get violently sick!

08:01.992 --> 08:07.136
Ruffians, don't hit us with that if we ever decide to get nice and close to your plants, okay?

08:30.649 --> 08:32.550
I don't want to get bonked by the shoe, okay?

08:32.690 --> 08:35.913
Don't bonk us with your shoe, Ruffians.

08:36.113 --> 08:40.035
But shoes and slippers are the best against unwanted pests, though, right?

08:40.456 --> 08:40.876
It is.

08:40.916 --> 08:42.217
You know an unwanted pest?

08:43.958 --> 08:44.178
I guess.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.699
He's good at biting plants, you know.

08:45.719 --> 08:46.399
Yeah, he's a pest.

08:47.380 --> 08:51.383
But we were taught this secret method between guard dogs here in Japan and

08:52.003 --> 08:54.445
Since then, we've never done anything else.

08:54.485 --> 08:55.045
This is it.

08:55.145 --> 08:55.906
This is the method.

08:56.306 --> 09:00.289
I think some ruffians know that I don't really like socks.

09:01.309 --> 09:05.252
And I have slippers, but they're rarely used for my feet.

09:06.893 --> 09:07.213
BAU BAU!

09:07.293 --> 09:07.934
BAU BAU!

09:07.954 --> 09:08.294
BAU BAU!

09:08.314 --> 09:09.014
BAU BAU!

09:36.698 --> 09:43.402
Well, we'd actually like to invite you to our Advent Halloween Party!

09:43.482 --> 09:44.663
BAU BAU BAU!

09:44.703 --> 09:46.784
Ruffians, I see a lot of noise.

09:47.265 --> 09:48.305
I'm concerned.

09:48.746 --> 09:49.946
We invited you already.

09:49.986 --> 09:52.448
We invited you already, you didn't forget about our invitation.

09:52.488 --> 09:53.749
You didn't forget, right.

09:53.949 --> 09:54.890
We invited you.

09:56.511 --> 09:57.771
I'm really concerned, Moco-chan.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.412
Right.

09:59.096 --> 10:01.857
Well, ruffians, now you have plans, okay?

10:02.357 --> 10:03.157
We have plans!

10:03.277 --> 10:05.478
There is plans, you have plans!

10:05.838 --> 10:11.599
Because this year, we're having a Halloween party!

10:12.039 --> 10:15.380
A special costume party too!

10:15.680 --> 10:18.741
A lot of ruffians have been designing outfits for us, right?

10:18.781 --> 10:20.261
I'm really happy!

10:20.301 --> 10:23.162
But you haven't forgotten about yourself too, right?

10:25.591 --> 10:28.413
You need to have a costume for yourself too, you know.

10:28.653 --> 10:29.894
It's a costume party.

10:30.274 --> 10:36.479
Please don't forget to share your hololive themed costumes with the hashtag Advent Costume Party on Twitter.

10:36.779 --> 10:37.719
And you know what?

10:38.260 --> 10:42.643
All of Advent, we might review it during our party.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.705
That would be pretty cool, right?

10:46.465 --> 10:49.208
You know, it doesn't even need to be anything amazing at all.

10:49.489 --> 10:50.530
Nothing fancy.

10:50.790 --> 10:53.033
We just want to see your love and passion, right?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.334
Just that, you know.

10:54.455 --> 10:57.338
You know you could dress up as a pebble, right?

10:57.778 --> 11:00.281
Or a petal like I mentioned yesterday, too.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.906
Or even like a FUWAMOCO-themed outfit, right?

11:04.286 --> 11:05.027
You know, we've got some...

11:06.108 --> 11:08.169
Please share them with us, okay?

11:08.229 --> 11:09.370
We're waiting!

11:09.510 --> 11:10.130
We're waiting!

11:35.604 --> 11:37.466
BAU BAU!

11:39.247 --> 11:40.408
I'm excited for you.

11:40.848 --> 11:43.670
Lots of Halloween stories.

11:44.010 --> 11:47.893
But not Halloween related.

11:48.233 --> 11:56.799
Ruffians, Moco-chan has something to confess to you.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.361
Something kind of...

12:00.120 --> 12:02.281
Really, really, really embarrassing.

12:02.361 --> 12:07.444
And, you know, Moco-chan, she's been kind of thinking about whether she should share it with you for a long time now.

12:07.484 --> 12:09.125
It sounds like you're pretty happy, huh?

12:09.386 --> 12:09.606
Me?

12:09.946 --> 12:12.588
No, but, you know, it's been, it's been weighing on your chest.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.489
It's been really, really embarrassing!

12:14.589 --> 12:20.032
It's been weighing on your chest and, you know, it might be good to feel FU afterwards, you know?

12:20.833 --> 12:21.093
Yeah.

12:21.393 --> 12:24.715
But it's... You don't want anything weighing on my chest?

12:28.968 --> 12:30.189
Wow, Moco-chan.

12:30.869 --> 12:31.430
Please, yeah.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.832
Feel free, feel free, you know?

12:34.032 --> 12:34.712
Freedom waits.

12:37.554 --> 12:38.455
BAU!

12:40.657 --> 12:53.766
You know... It might be a bit surprising, but... I'm actually really afraid of big dogs.

12:56.769 --> 12:56.929
Yeah.

12:58.476 --> 13:06.883
You know, any dog that's bigger than me, for some reason, I don't really know why, but maybe they feel the fear from me.

13:06.903 --> 13:11.087
But they seem to like me in particular compared to Fuwawa.

13:11.107 --> 13:14.310
It's really embarrassing.

13:14.841 --> 13:24.130
You know, even when I try to sneak away from any big dogs approaching me when we go on our walks, they always end up running up to me and it makes me scared so I flinch and then hide behind Fuwawa.

13:25.591 --> 13:26.452
It's really embarrassing.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.395
It's embarrassing for me too, Ruffians.

13:29.635 --> 13:34.500
I'm sure the owner thinks I'm pretty funny, huh?

13:34.560 --> 13:35.060
Yeah.

13:37.342 --> 13:37.562
No.

13:38.083 --> 13:38.964
Smaller dogs.

13:39.564 --> 13:39.925
Okay.

13:40.605 --> 13:41.426
Medium dogs.

13:42.367 --> 13:42.767
Okay.

13:43.408 --> 13:45.250
Extremely fluffy big dogs.

13:47.171 --> 13:48.813
Maybe okay if they have good manners.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.154
Okay.

13:50.254 --> 13:54.058
But for most big dogs, I like to keep my distance.

13:55.239 --> 13:57.841
I'm sorry if your doggy is a big dog.

13:59.013 --> 14:02.536
I like to keep a good distance between us until I'm used to them.

14:03.096 --> 14:04.718
Then we can be friends.

14:05.578 --> 14:09.381
But until then, I'd like them to stay away from me.

14:10.202 --> 14:11.083
It makes me nervous.

14:15.046 --> 14:16.127
But you know, Ruffians!

14:16.968 --> 14:18.128
Don't misunderstand, okay?

14:18.149 --> 14:24.033
Because I'm a tough, big, demon guard dog, okay?

14:24.133 --> 14:25.314
Don't misunderstand!

14:26.755 --> 14:27.176
I'm big.

14:27.816 --> 14:28.217
I'm big.

14:29.366 --> 14:29.886
I'm big!

14:31.547 --> 14:31.947
Got it.

14:34.048 --> 14:34.668
Got it!

14:35.408 --> 14:36.248
Yeah, right!

14:36.869 --> 14:37.889
Tough puppy.

14:37.929 --> 14:38.589
I'm tough!

14:39.049 --> 14:39.649
I'm rough!

14:40.130 --> 14:40.790
I'm big!

14:42.210 --> 14:42.650
Got it.

14:44.071 --> 14:45.171
BAU BAU!

14:45.191 --> 14:46.692
Do you feel better, Moco-chan?

14:47.752 --> 14:49.273
The ruffians don't understand.

14:49.293 --> 14:50.693
That makes me feel unhappy.

14:54.488 --> 14:57.330
I'll give a ruffian some time and I should've come around, right?

14:57.470 --> 14:58.290
You'll come around?

14:58.350 --> 14:58.730
Yeah.

14:58.750 --> 15:02.812
Did you say so?

15:03.012 --> 15:04.173
I opened my heart.

15:05.413 --> 15:06.554
I opened my heart.

15:06.574 --> 15:07.955
You did.

15:08.695 --> 15:09.115
You did.

15:09.595 --> 15:10.556
I should've come around.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.817
I'll accept it, okay?

15:13.317 --> 15:15.658
It's not a question, it's an answer.

15:15.678 --> 15:18.840
BAU BAU!

15:20.034 --> 15:23.676
Well, Ruffians, we have some happy news!

15:23.776 --> 15:26.157
Happy news!

15:26.217 --> 15:29.298
Now that Moco-chan's confessed, you feel a little bit lighter.

15:29.819 --> 15:33.180
Well, we can share some good news!

15:33.260 --> 15:35.301
Happy news!

15:36.862 --> 15:41.164
Ruffians, Papa Puppy came by yesterday.

15:41.224 --> 15:44.845
And he came by with his two kids, too!

15:45.065 --> 15:45.726
And guess what?

15:46.769 --> 15:47.390
Guess what?

15:48.350 --> 15:51.573
Moco-chan's chair is REVISED!

15:51.833 --> 15:52.954
I have my arm back!

15:53.454 --> 15:55.316
It's huge!

15:55.396 --> 15:58.438
Moco-chan even found all the screws for the chair too!

15:58.578 --> 15:59.539
I'm amazing!

15:59.559 --> 16:00.820
I have them all!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.321
It's arm is back.

16:02.381 --> 16:02.962
It's fixed.

16:04.203 --> 16:12.850
For now, as Puppapuppi put it very ominously, he was actually even surprised that the other arm hadn't fallen off yet too.

16:15.724 --> 16:20.688
Actually, he did break a tool in the process of fixing it.

16:24.392 --> 16:27.535
There is a sacrifice for the revival of it.

16:27.955 --> 16:32.119
Let's see maybe how many Donkey Kong Country themes it will take until it breaks?

16:33.380 --> 16:33.640
Maybe?

16:33.661 --> 16:35.903
Can we not do that?

16:38.382 --> 16:39.042
It'll be okay.

16:39.283 --> 16:41.924
How many more Donkey Kong Country sims do we even have?

16:41.984 --> 16:42.925
We're almost done, right?

16:43.225 --> 16:45.947
I don't know, we go pretty bananas.

16:46.407 --> 16:49.069
The chair will be okay.

16:49.229 --> 16:49.730
BAU BAU!

16:49.770 --> 16:54.633
Happy new, happy news!

16:54.653 --> 16:55.934
Welcome back, chair arm.

16:55.974 --> 16:56.994
BAU BAU!

17:00.670 --> 17:06.074
It's weird having the orange back, but it's happy.

17:06.094 --> 17:07.815
More happy stuff, right?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.276
Ruffians!

17:14.758 --> 17:19.299
You were there with us early yesterday when we played Horo no Suika, right?

17:19.319 --> 17:19.860
It was a lot of fun, right?

17:19.880 --> 17:20.100
It was fun.

17:20.120 --> 17:20.220
Right!

17:20.240 --> 17:20.360

High score!

17:41.406 --> 17:41.746
High score!

17:42.082 --> 17:47.846
So, we feel like we need to clear things up so that no more misunderstandings.

17:48.406 --> 17:51.508
Well, our beloved senpai was there, right?

17:52.368 --> 18:00.913
And Moco-chan might have accidentally said things like, you know, we have to get rid of this senpai or there's a lot of garbage.

18:01.434 --> 18:03.175
Referring to our senpai.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.924
Moco-chan, it's just all a misunderstanding, right?

18:07.024 --> 18:07.885
It's a misunderstanding!

18:07.925 --> 18:11.668
You know, it's garbage in an affectionate way.

18:12.588 --> 18:14.049
That's the way you use it.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.772
Yeah, like garbage can make a lot of amazing things, right?

18:17.812 --> 18:19.013
Like jewelry and...

18:20.154 --> 18:21.614
You're just garbage to me!

18:21.634 --> 18:22.535
You're just garbage to me!

18:49.361 --> 18:56.268
Ruffians, you're good with that, right?

18:57.409 --> 18:59.270
But see, this is exactly it.

18:59.311 --> 19:00.952
Ruffians, you understand, right?

19:01.232 --> 19:03.975
That's why garbage is an endearing term.

19:03.995 --> 19:05.256
Yeah, just like useless.

19:05.536 --> 19:07.358
I say that a lot when playing games.

19:07.759 --> 19:08.539
You're useless.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.762
You called me useless before too, but it's endearing.

19:11.822 --> 19:12.843
But I like you.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.335
No misunderstandings!

19:15.455 --> 19:15.835
It's good.

19:15.875 --> 19:16.416
We love A.I.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.936
Senpai very much.

19:17.976 --> 19:18.516
Lots of respect.

19:18.536 --> 19:19.056
That's A.I.

19:19.096 --> 19:20.056
Senpai, okay?

19:20.156 --> 19:21.297
No misunderstandings!

19:21.317 --> 19:21.537
BAU BAU!

19:36.500 --> 19:39.061
You love garbage.

19:39.401 --> 19:40.802
The ruffians are garbage.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.547
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

20:19.474 --> 20:19.854
Raspberries.

20:19.894 --> 20:21.274
Frozen raspberries.

20:21.615 --> 20:22.475
And you take this.

20:23.195 --> 20:24.255
You add some milk.

20:24.695 --> 20:26.336
And then you get this!

20:27.076 --> 20:28.016
Yummy!

20:28.116 --> 20:30.917
Frozen raspberries and milk!

20:30.957 --> 20:32.877
You crush them up and put milk on it.

20:33.278 --> 20:35.198
And then it becomes like an ice cream.

20:35.458 --> 20:36.118
It's so yummy!

20:36.278 --> 20:37.439
It's very good.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.400
We've been a bit addicted to it recently.

20:41.500 --> 20:41.780
Yeah.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.000
We really like sweet and sour things.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.281
Raspberries are just that.

20:45.381 --> 20:46.021
Yeah!

20:47.096 --> 20:51.259
Moco-chan has to have her own bag, and I have to have my own bag too.

21:05.188 --> 21:09.350
There's no confusion, and no one steals each other's raspberries when they're not looking.

21:09.690 --> 21:14.592
I know there's the ice cream machines, but it's fine, just using arm power, you know.

21:14.612 --> 21:16.632
Squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish.

21:17.093 --> 21:18.593
Yeah, and then just mix it all up.

21:19.313 --> 21:19.714
Ice cream.

21:20.454 --> 21:22.815
Do you think you'll try it, Ruffian?

21:24.195 --> 21:25.616
Never tried it, but it sounds delicious.

21:25.656 --> 21:26.216
It is!

21:26.276 --> 21:27.417
You should try it!

21:27.437 --> 21:27.557
Honey!

21:27.817 --> 21:29.357
You don't need honey for it.

21:29.417 --> 21:29.897
No honey.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.318
Just milk and raspberries.

21:31.378 --> 21:32.518
Right, the raspberries.

21:32.719 --> 21:33.179
Soy milk!

21:35.868 --> 21:37.028
Not soy milk, maybe.

21:37.048 --> 21:38.349
Something a bit more milky.

21:38.409 --> 21:40.050
A bit more milky.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.611
Yeah, it's almost like a milkshake, but ice cream.

21:43.012 --> 21:43.592
Right.

21:43.972 --> 21:44.652
You should try it.

21:44.692 --> 21:46.193
You should try it.

21:46.513 --> 21:51.116
Yeah, it's oishii.

21:51.136 --> 21:52.477
It's oishii.

21:52.517 --> 21:53.017
Yes.

21:53.237 --> 21:54.138
We recommend.

21:54.238 --> 21:57.820
Yes, our big recommendation of today, Friday.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.322
Friday is Frozen Raspberry Day.

22:02.382 --> 22:04.163
BAU BAU!

22:04.804 --> 22:08.286
Well, let's move on to our regular corner, Moco-chan.

22:08.667 --> 22:12.890
Today we have another Doggie of the Day!

22:13.330 --> 22:14.871
Who's the doggy today?

22:15.491 --> 22:16.132
De-den!

22:16.152 --> 22:19.274
It's Hazel!

22:21.115 --> 22:24.497
She's 13 years old and pretty cranky.

22:24.578 --> 22:29.240
I guess 13 years of wisdom can get someone pretty cranky.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.281
But here she is.

22:30.581 --> 22:33.203
She's here with her favorite hot dog toy.

22:33.283 --> 22:34.003
Hot dog.

22:34.023 --> 22:35.064
She wants her privacy.

22:35.924 --> 22:38.886
Don't get too close to her and her favorite toy, right?

22:39.607 --> 22:41.368
She does look a bit big.

22:41.848 --> 22:44.249
But she also sort of looks like a hot dog.

22:44.590 --> 22:45.370
A spicy hot dog.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.291
A spicy hot dog.

22:48.792 --> 22:49.794
Cute.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.236
How does she BAU BAU?

22:51.296 --> 22:55.022
You know, maybe like a BAU BAU and she's really excited for her hotdog?

22:55.042 --> 22:58.487
You know like... BAU BAU!

22:59.188 --> 22:59.889
BAU BAU!

23:00.109 --> 23:01.632
Give me the hotdog BAU BAU BAU BAU!

23:01.832 --> 23:02.213
Like that?

23:02.233 --> 23:02.313
Yeah.

23:03.626 --> 23:05.047
I'm sure, yes.

23:22.438 --> 23:23.958
That's why her crankiness is good.

23:23.998 --> 23:25.599
She can protect you.

23:25.619 --> 23:26.779
She can help, you know?

23:27.239 --> 23:27.559
It's good.

23:27.599 --> 23:30.100
Crankiness is extra protection skill.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.200
It's a good thing.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.681
Yeah, but just make sure that you don't get in between her and her hotdog time.

23:35.721 --> 23:36.721
No, no, no.

23:36.981 --> 23:38.121
Precious hotdog time.

23:38.161 --> 23:38.981
Precious hotdog.

23:39.122 --> 23:39.742
Don't touch.

23:40.102 --> 23:40.942
BAU BAU!

23:41.082 --> 23:47.383
Did a ruffian go on to a nice walk?

23:47.843 --> 23:48.884
Let's see!

23:49.404 --> 23:50.284
De-den!

23:52.382 --> 23:53.823
Is this a painting?

23:54.124 --> 23:54.925
Is this real?

23:55.265 --> 23:56.306
Is this real life?

23:57.087 --> 23:58.208
It's beautiful!

23:58.368 --> 24:01.031
It's really, really beautiful.

24:02.212 --> 24:05.095
Why didn't you just stop there and live there forever?

24:07.057 --> 24:08.258
It's so pretty, right?

24:09.039 --> 24:11.501
I think I would just cry if I saw this in real life.

24:12.922 --> 24:18.326
Sights like this make you really grateful for the passing seasons and passing time.

24:18.506 --> 24:18.907
Right!

24:18.967 --> 24:20.788
It makes you feel alive too!

24:20.948 --> 24:22.690
Too many bugs, that's not important.

24:22.770 --> 24:23.530
It's beautiful.

24:24.011 --> 24:26.032
Don't worry about the bugs when it's this beautiful.

24:27.193 --> 24:30.654
I think this probably has to be one of the best wall shots from the ruffians so far.

24:30.714 --> 24:32.054
It's really beautiful.

24:32.074 --> 24:32.495
Right?

24:32.675 --> 24:35.235
All those leaves, every single leaf is yellow.

24:35.255 --> 24:37.456
And then the blue skies.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.937
It's amazing.

24:40.137 --> 24:42.077
A beautiful walk indeed.

24:42.237 --> 24:44.078
Hopefully we can go on more walks here.

24:44.638 --> 24:45.338
It's very nice.

24:45.878 --> 24:46.518
BAU BAU!

24:49.839 --> 24:52.341
And finally, for our question of the day!

24:52.821 --> 24:56.224
We have... De-den!

24:57.104 --> 25:01.487
How long did it take you to decide on Ruffians as your fan name while you were in the cell?

25:01.928 --> 25:05.930
Are you able to share any of the other names you were considering before deciding?

25:06.411 --> 25:11.194
It took us a little while to figure it out, but I think Moco-chan, you mentioned it before?

25:11.214 --> 25:13.015
I mentioned it before, just a little bit.

25:13.336 --> 25:17.338
But it was the first thing that came to Moco-chan's mind when she woke up one moment.

25:17.759 --> 25:18.039
Yeah!

25:18.479 --> 25:19.060
I woke up.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.421
I literally woke up.

25:20.781 --> 25:22.723
And then I was like, ruffians.

25:23.804 --> 25:27.146
Even before she said good morning or anything to me.

25:27.387 --> 25:29.989
But before that we had some ideas.

25:30.169 --> 25:31.790
Fluffer, fluffer was one of them.

25:31.810 --> 25:34.232
But Mari-chan said it's not the best.

25:34.252 --> 25:38.696
Yeah, because you know, when you fluzzers right, it has to be equal so it doesn't work.

25:40.197 --> 25:40.557
Ruffians.

25:40.577 --> 25:40.978
Abyssians.

25:40.998 --> 25:41.638
Doggie Pack.

25:41.658 --> 25:42.078
Doggie Pack.

26:00.289 --> 26:03.972
It's a very warm winter's night.

26:05.092 --> 26:07.214
I think it's only ruffians.

26:08.374 --> 26:10.696
Very rough, very soft.

26:10.776 --> 26:11.336
Special.

26:11.476 --> 26:11.897
BAU BAU!

26:11.917 --> 26:18.121
We like ruffians too because you're a ruffian so you can't change that.

26:18.181 --> 26:19.581
What about kerfluffians though?

26:19.601 --> 26:20.382
Kerfluffians?

26:20.422 --> 26:22.403
Kerfluffians!

26:25.745 --> 26:27.668
Doggy, doggy, doggy days.

26:43.687 --> 26:47.868
Thank you everyone.

26:48.368 --> 26:50.309
Please don't forget to use the hashtag.

26:50.349 --> 26:54.590
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

26:55.110 --> 26:56.170
You thought too.

26:56.530 --> 26:58.270
BAU BAU!

26:58.330 --> 27:02.371
Thank you!

27:02.731 --> 27:05.292
Our next stream, we have another stream coming up.

27:08.217 --> 27:09.739
We got a new job, ruffians!

27:09.799 --> 27:11.301
Our job is... We have two jobs now.

27:11.321 --> 27:12.822
To protect your smile, and we have to work...

27:22.353 --> 27:24.756
Part-time at the convenience store.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.139
Do we at least get to sample the new products?

27:37.933 --> 27:40.794
Do we get to have the food that's left over and gonna expire?

27:40.814 --> 27:41.934
That would be nice, no?

27:41.954 --> 27:42.634
Yeah.

27:42.834 --> 27:45.035
If we do that, can we get promoted to tengchou?

27:45.055 --> 27:46.595
By eating the leftover food?

27:47.316 --> 27:48.356
I guess it helps with waste.

27:48.636 --> 27:49.236
Yeah!

27:49.936 --> 27:51.897
But we'll do our best, ruffians!

27:51.937 --> 27:55.138
We'll do our best to make every customer that comes in smile!

27:55.238 --> 27:55.738
Yeah!

27:55.758 --> 27:57.718
This is our convenience store!

27:57.778 --> 27:58.499
And you too!

27:59.079 --> 28:01.719
We need to make a lasting impression.

28:01.779 --> 28:02.100
Yeah.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.140
BAU BAU!

28:05.500 --> 28:06.941
And our schedule!

28:07.912 --> 28:10.795
Rock n' Rawr Party!

28:10.935 --> 28:12.537
We're excited!

28:12.597 --> 28:14.479
We're hyped!

28:14.879 --> 28:17.242
It's gonna be very spooky and silly.

28:26.027 --> 28:30.889
You know we're gonna sing a lot of songs that make us feel a bit of shiver when we hear them.

28:31.209 --> 28:31.609
Shiver.

28:33.050 --> 28:35.251
So we hope that you feel that way too.

28:35.791 --> 28:37.632
We're gonna make the ruffians shiver.

28:37.892 --> 28:40.533
We're gonna make the hair on your arms stand up.

28:42.014 --> 28:42.774
Maybe.

28:42.814 --> 28:43.394
Maybe.

28:43.654 --> 28:46.455
Do we have like a recommended drink of choice for the moment?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.435
To enjoy while walking or partying?

28:48.475 --> 28:52.416
It's a Halloween special, so... I guess apple juice or apple cider?

28:52.436 --> 28:56.117
Yummy full tasting!

28:56.277 --> 29:02.158
But we're really excited because we'll be singing a few songs that we really didn't think we'd ever be able to sing for you!

29:02.178 --> 29:03.498
We prepared specially!

29:03.518 --> 29:07.199
