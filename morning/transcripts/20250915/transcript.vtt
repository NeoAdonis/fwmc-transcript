00:04:56.153 --> 00:04:58.018
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.129
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.513
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:11.074
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:17.133
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:20.957
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:24.260
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.982
BAU BAU!

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:30.447
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:38.436
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 172nd episode!

00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:40.978
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:41.259
Good Morning!

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.719
Good Morning!

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:46.904
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:50.749
Are you sure you're Fuwawa?

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:50.990
I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.410
I'm not a chihuahua!

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.692
I am not a chihuahua!

00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:56.578
You seem confused on joining this...cast here.

00:05:56.598 --> 00:06:01.846
I don't know, you know, my voice is kinda like... Maybe you might think, that's a chihuahua.

00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:04.170
I'm not a chihuahua!

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.311
I am Fuwawa!

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:06.694
Okay?

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:06.994
Got it?

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:10.980
It can be surprising sometimes.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:29.408
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:32.012
Held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:33.535
A.K.A.

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:33.835
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:37.161
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:41.468
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be blah blah blah, but chill!

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.553
Temporarily on Mondays, once a week.

00:06:44.694 --> 00:06:46.236
So we can get some more balance.

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:47.278
Yes!

00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:48.219
And that's been going well.

00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:50.161
Yes.

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:55.388
I aim to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:55.568 --> 00:07:00.714
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:05.039
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.482
BAU BAU!

00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:11.747
I really, really felt it this time, Moco-chan.

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:13.726
I felt it inside your soul.

00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:16.329
I did.

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.932
I feel like, you know, this is gonna be a good week.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:19.673
Yes!

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.655
Start it off on the right paw.

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:22.737
What?

00:07:23.017 --> 00:07:23.397
What?

00:07:24.018 --> 00:07:26.861
Let's all do it, okay, FUWAMOCO?

00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:30.926
FUWAMOCO-chan, you know it's a big weekend.

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:31.026
Huh?

00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:31.406
Why?

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:37.253
But there was really good things going on, like a celebration.

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:38.494
Huh?

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:41.043
No.

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:47.490
Nice pen.

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:48.992
What?

00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:49.372
Moco-chan!

00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.317
A sneeze?

00:07:54.238 --> 00:07:57.621
That's not bad.

00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.625
Moco-chan, don't sneeze on me!

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:02.867
BAU!

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:05.730
You see it, Moco-chan?

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:08.678
Another Pero Sighting!

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.723
BAU BAU!

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:14.707
Hi.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:14.888
Well.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.418
You didn't just happen to sneeze a Pero out of your... No?

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:21.498
No?

00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:23.521
The wolf means I'm the wolf.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:23.781
Okay.

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:24.883
Pero Sighting.

00:08:25.268 --> 00:08:29.334
Oh, where was Pero Sighted this time?

00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:31.777
Let's take a look.

00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:33.059
De-den!

00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:35.583
Ruffians!

00:08:35.603 --> 00:08:36.283
What the heck?!

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.092
You need to do something about this!

00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:43.353
Hai!

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:46.618
Hai!

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:55.061
Ruffians, are you just going to let Pero be all cuddly and snug under the blankets with the FUWAMOCO on either side?

00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:55.141
Hi.

00:08:56.463 --> 00:08:56.763
No.

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:58.205
You can't do this!

00:08:58.225 --> 00:08:59.727
You have to get him out of there!

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:01.469
It's nasty!

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.352
You know, get him some pudding.

00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:07.015
Pudding, yeah.

00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:07.956
I don't know Ruffians.

00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:10.419
He looks really comfy.

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:12.442
Not lucky, no!

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.344
Awful!

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:20.134
Yeah, I think you know pudding's the only thing that's gonna get him out of there.

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:24.020
I do that with punches.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.165
But if you give him pudding, then he'll have pudding, right?

00:09:29.387 --> 00:09:33.673
Yeah, but of all things, I think you know there's one way to solve this?

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:40.022
Misha, so lock your doors and your windows too, okay?

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:40.602
Yeah.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:40.863
Safety.

00:09:41.584 --> 00:09:42.024
Okay?

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.027
Otherwise...

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.567
This might happen to you.

00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:49.089
Bye Pero.

00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:54.317
Feeling a bit eepy?

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:57.001
You can't be swayed!

00:09:57.021 --> 00:09:59.585
Yeah... No, it doesn't matter!

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:02.589
It doesn't matter if he's eepy!

00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:03.470
Pero, doggy, but it's cushion size!

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.333
It's not!

00:10:05.353 --> 00:10:06.315
Ruffians!

00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:07.757
We really want to hug you.

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:08.858
We want to protect you.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:15.448
We want you to protect your smile, Ruffians, but... Not like this.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.942
This is not how it works.

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:20.626
Be careful!

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:21.948
Got it!

00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:22.709
Lock your doors.

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:24.311
Lock your windows, okay?

00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:26.955
And make sure to have pudding in the fridge.

00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:28.056
At all times.

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:28.377
Emergency.

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:30.720
For you and for him.

00:10:33.163 --> 00:10:33.323
BAU BAU!

00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:34.585
Got it.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.034
Over!

00:10:38.277 --> 00:10:39.840
Pero be squished.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.761
Squished?

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:41.262
Squish him!

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:42.986
Squash him!

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:44.228
Smash him!

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:45.511
Destroy him!

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.078
That's a lot of violent words there, Moco-chan.

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:50.160
Why not?

00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:55.869
You know, I guess we could blend them too.

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:56.250
Blend?

00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:57.733
Does it blend?

00:10:59.095 --> 00:10:59.355
Pero edition!

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:01.559
BAU BAU!

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.462
We're starting the day on the right paw.

00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:04.244
Does it blend?

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:07.429
Sometimes you know it's good to have a smoothie in the morning.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.312
Morning smoothie!

00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:11.616
Pero edition.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.628
Recently there was something very exciting that happened!

00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:27.409
Yes, read our minds, do it!

00:11:28.673 --> 00:11:30.498
First thing in the morning, I know you can mind read!

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.867
Nope, nope, too late.

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:46.143
It was hololive English's 5th Anniversary Advent on Midsummer's Anniversary!

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:46.323
BAU BAU!

00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:46.664
Congratulations!

00:11:46.684 --> 00:11:59.263
A big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:03.573
You know, it's a really big celebration!

00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:10.986
Without all the men who worked so so hard and continues to work really hard, we wouldn't be here right now.

00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:14.211
So a very big big thank you!

00:12:15.073 --> 00:12:17.938
All the respect and congratulations!

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:22.986
But to celebrate, they all did a bunch of amazing things!

00:12:23.006 --> 00:12:24.188
Lots of fun!

00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:25.550
Hey, how'd you know?

00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:28.193
Kiara-chan-pon!

00:12:28.213 --> 00:12:30.976
She did a bunch of different celebrations, fun things!

00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:35.581
But she also did some 3D karaoke as well!

00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:35.921
Cute new outfit!

00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:36.061
Right!

00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:37.363
It's a new one, I think, right?

00:12:37.383 --> 00:12:38.704
She looks amazing in red!

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.006
Red really suits her!

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:40.967
Right!

00:12:41.087 --> 00:12:42.509
The whole theme too!

00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:46.013
Yeah, we're sort of matching with the chains here!

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.876
Okay, Moco.

00:12:49.637 --> 00:12:50.698
Matching.

00:12:50.982 --> 00:13:00.473
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:12.568
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:18.497
But it was a really really fun time for all the KFBs!

00:13:18.517 --> 00:13:18.938
It is a tasty outfit!

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.723
I thought I recognized it!

00:13:20.743 --> 00:13:22.508
But it's not my real color, no!

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:27.528
No, it's in multiple colors in the PV.

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:27.808
That's right.

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:30.572
I don't know, maybe it's... Was there chains on it?

00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:31.593
Maybe I just forgot.

00:13:31.913 --> 00:13:34.356
Moco-chan, it's your fifth anniversary.

00:13:34.757 --> 00:13:37.460
Not Kiara-san, but she's going on to her sixth year.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.024
Everything just looks kind of more exquisite now, right?

00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:43.207
That's what happens when you level up.

00:13:43.287 --> 00:13:44.088
She's blue and red?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.051
Is it the accessories?

00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:47.352
I don't know.

00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:50.116
It looks very, very fashionable.

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.297
Stunning.

00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:54.881
And Calli-senpai!

00:13:54.901 --> 00:14:01.647
She celebrated her 5th anniversary with a very special 3D VR chat stream!

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:04.630
What's this, Moco-chan?

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.814
We swam and danced together, although it may not look like it there.

00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:15.602
And not just us two, all of hololive are there singing and dancing together with Calli-senpai!

00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:21.047
And you know, she also did some reminiscing of some very special places over

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.132
For the past five years in VRChat 2.

00:14:24.272 --> 00:14:35.408
And well, it wasn't our first time, you know, singing just alone with Calli-senpai, but it was our first time singing one of her songs!

00:14:35.428 --> 00:14:36.169
And the fans are really excited!

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.409
Camouflage!

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:43.660
Calli-senpai picked camouflage, but we are very happy because we have lots of memories of it too.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.149
Although, I must say I never imagined us singing that together with Calli-senpai.

00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:54.975
So, I'm really happy that amazing things continue to happen as well.

00:14:55.055 --> 00:15:00.202
We're still getting used to VRChat.

00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:01.985
We're getting used to VRChat.

00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:05.209
And, of course, we had to do one thing.

00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:10.094
Yeah!

00:15:10.114 --> 00:15:10.674
We had to hug Calli-senpai!

00:15:10.694 --> 00:15:10.794
Yeah!

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.436
It was a very funny feeling.

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:17.761
It was amazing seeing her so close up like this.

00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:18.082
Right?

00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:20.724
It was a new outfit too.

00:15:20.744 --> 00:15:21.325
I was right up in her armpit.

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:21.445
Yeah!

00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:22.446
Moco-chan, you have to say it like that!

00:15:22.826 --> 00:15:24.928
I mean, you can see the proof is right there.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:26.670
Yeah!

00:15:28.472 --> 00:15:30.434
But it was a lot of fun.

00:15:30.454 --> 00:15:34.858
We hope to be able to do more things like this together via chat as well.

00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:43.932
But also can't accept but at the end of her celebration, she released a new song called Orpheus!

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:47.657
Yeah BAU BAU!

00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:48.238
Congratulations!

00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:52.725
It has very cute lyrics and very cute animation too!

00:15:52.745 --> 00:15:52.965
Very funky!

00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:54.807
Yeah, so please check it out.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:16:02.597
I feel like, you know, Calli-senpai, she continues to release a new song that does something very different from all the previous songs, too.

00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:04.780
I really love that, you know.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.305
Yeah, keep on, you know, surprising us, even reading, you know.

00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:10.407
Right, yeah.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:15.593
So please go have a listen!

00:16:15.613 --> 00:16:16.354
And well, Ina-senpai!

00:16:16.334 --> 00:16:22.443
In true Ina-senpai fashion, she had a very chill, relaxing celebration.

00:16:22.844 --> 00:16:35.524
She looked at a very, very sweet project made by all the Takodachi and then also shared that she has an Ina Academy project that she's gonna be doing with the Takodachi.

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:37.967
Sounds like a lot of fun!

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.992
Ina Academy yo!

00:16:40.972 --> 00:16:47.399
I hope that a lot of takodachi have fun doing it because they'll make me so nervous!

00:16:47.419 --> 00:16:47.620
I will be!

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:47.940
I will be!

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.822
Mina-senpai, look at my artwork!

00:16:51.924 --> 00:16:55.108
Let's not, let's not make her suffer.

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:56.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.611
No, it's okay.

00:16:58.432 --> 00:17:03.878
I was doing my best to draw and watch the other day while we were doing some recording.

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:07.502
I didn't want to hand back the script.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:13.163
No, because usually you know at the end the staff is going to take the scripts back.

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:16.672
Yeah, I was like, wait, we'll take this one home.

00:17:18.316 --> 00:17:21.323
Yeah, I had a whole bunch of little drawings.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.004
Can we call that on it?

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:26.425
Yeah.

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.287
I told her to leave it on.

00:17:28.307 --> 00:17:31.751
I don't think Staff-san looked at it.

00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:32.653
Yeah, fair.

00:17:32.673 --> 00:17:32.793
I see.

00:17:34.475 --> 00:17:37.359
But we had a bunch of fun things going on.

00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:40.583
And then also all Mifco together had a collab.

00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:47.952
When they announced that they will be having a 5th anniversary 3D collab soon!

00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:51.415
It's going to be happening on the hololive English official channel.

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:52.956
On, is this correct?

00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:57.480
The 20th at 8pm PT.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.021
Is this correct?

00:17:58.581 --> 00:17:59.542
Confirm.

00:17:59.562 --> 00:18:00.683
Is that the correct time?

00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:01.944
Help.

00:18:01.964 --> 00:18:02.845
Help.

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:04.266
I believe that is the time.

00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:05.046
Help.

00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:05.907
Help.

00:18:05.927 --> 00:18:07.849
Completely off the top of my head.

00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:08.089
Help.

00:18:08.249 --> 00:18:08.670
Help.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.130
Help.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.330
Help.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.031
On the 21st.

00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:10.871
Yes, yes, yes.

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.272
In Japan.

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:11.552
That's right.

00:18:11.572 --> 00:18:14.114
We're trying to celebrate.

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:14.555
Fortune Spinner!

00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:17.517
We know what time it is in Japan, but... Help.

00:18:18.273 --> 00:18:19.415
Help.

00:18:19.455 --> 00:18:23.942
Is that time?

00:18:23.962 --> 00:18:24.783
It is quick.

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:25.725
Thank you!

00:18:25.745 --> 00:18:26.065
Okay, thank you!

00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:26.446
That's what it is.

00:18:26.466 --> 00:18:27.487
At 8pm PT, so please make sure to tune in there.

00:18:28.168 --> 00:18:28.849
Is that a 7?

00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:28.949
Huh?

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:29.510
Is it 7?

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:31.553
It could be 7.

00:18:31.614 --> 00:18:32.174
It could be 8.

00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:32.936
Be preparable.

00:18:33.396 --> 00:18:33.777
Yes.

00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:38.184
Get ready for 6pm PT and then you're ready if it's at 8pm PT or 7pm.

00:18:38.304 --> 00:18:41.509
Somewhere within the window of 6 to 7 to 8.

00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:42.270
Yes.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:42.671
It's 8.

00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:44.854
I don't know.

00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:47.705
FUWAMOCO!

00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:48.006
Figure it out!

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.847
I'm looking forward to it!

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:52.210
This anniversary is a huge one!

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.310
Yes!

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.255
But um, you know Moco-chan, we're on our third year in July.

00:18:57.275 --> 00:19:00.798
Next year, that would be our third anniversary.

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:02.880
Not that far away.

00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:04.782
It's not that far away.

00:19:04.802 --> 00:19:07.385
Are you panicked?

00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:08.165
You should be panicked.

00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:13.050
I'm not panicked, but I'm just like... I'm saying the Ruffians should be panicked!

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.792
You should be panicked.

00:19:14.812 --> 00:19:14.892
Why?

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:16.014
Panic now.

00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:17.215
Panic.

00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:18.637
Time goes so fast.

00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:21.840
So, so, so, so, so fast.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:21.960
Yeah.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.801
Ball time!

00:19:23.342 --> 00:19:24.183
What the heck?

00:19:25.825 --> 00:19:29.389
Yeah.

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:29.569
BAU BAU!

00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:30.750
Congratulations on 5 years!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.792
5 years since hololive English was born.

00:19:33.053 --> 00:19:33.613
Amazing.

00:19:34.054 --> 00:19:36.236
BAU BAU!

00:19:36.757 --> 00:19:37.397
BAU BAU!

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:41.622
And also over this very important weekend, there was um...

00:19:41.956 --> 00:19:44.159
Tournament shenanigans.

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:50.447
Yes, uh... Advent and Justice going into a bit of a fight.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:51.228
Ow!

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:51.428
Fighting!

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:54.372
Using, you know, traditional methods.

00:19:54.392 --> 00:19:54.512
Ow!

00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:56.935
Like... Chess!

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:57.956
Chess!

00:19:58.277 --> 00:19:59.037
Yes!

00:19:59.058 --> 00:20:00.940
Advent versus Justice!

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.081
In chess!

00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:05.045
Yes, we have a very important tournament.

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.388
Consisting of a one hour practice.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.010
But...

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.234
Not just one hour practice, one hour lesson.

00:20:12.474 --> 00:20:17.320
Very jam-packed one hour lesson with Olympic level coaches.

00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:18.642
Right?

00:20:18.702 --> 00:20:21.386
So now I'm like an Olympian.

00:20:21.406 --> 00:20:24.850
They had to teach us what the names of the pieces were.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.536
The horse goes gallop, gallop, gallop.

00:20:30.036 --> 00:20:30.918
Side to side.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:31.138
Yeah.

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.681
I'll never forget that.

00:20:33.863 --> 00:20:36.967
But, is it a horse or a knight?

00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:38.269
I don't know.

00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:38.449
Horse!

00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:39.490
Horse, yeah.

00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:41.713
But we had a lot of fun.

00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:43.475
We had our training.

00:20:43.956 --> 00:20:49.783
And then, well, just yesterday we had the big tournament.

00:20:49.804 --> 00:20:51.446
Yes, and best out of one.

00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:53.208
Advent Deathmatch and Chess.

00:20:53.268 --> 00:20:56.272
Advent.

00:20:56.332 --> 00:20:56.412
One.

00:20:58.012 --> 00:21:02.216
But that's okay because, you know, we always beat justice.

00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:07.341
And as you know, the senpai start to feel a little bit bad.

00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:07.461
Yeah.

00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:09.003
So we had to give them this one.

00:21:09.023 --> 00:21:10.464
We didn't want them to suffer anymore.

00:21:10.925 --> 00:21:11.425
Yeah, you know.

00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:13.327
We didn't start to run away with our king.

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:14.228
No.

00:21:14.248 --> 00:21:22.035
Just like, you can always outrun a child, but if you're playing tag, you can't just... You have to let them tag you.

00:21:22.796 --> 00:21:23.417
Tag you in.

00:21:24.598 --> 00:21:25.038
Right?

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:26.820
Right?

00:21:27.475 --> 00:21:30.361
Imagine you're playing tag with a child.

00:21:30.862 --> 00:21:32.366
You can just run away from them.

00:21:32.406 --> 00:21:33.729
Faster, right?

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:35.793
Oh, so this is the same?

00:21:36.234 --> 00:21:37.217
Yeah.

00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:39.241
Justice is a child.

00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:41.346
I can run faster than Justice.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.789
No matter what they say!

00:21:44.032 --> 00:21:46.918
But they'll be sad if I don't let them go tag, right?

00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:51.662
If you understand, that's what's important.

00:21:51.682 --> 00:21:52.544
Okay, Ruffians?

00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:54.168
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:55.431
You understand.

00:21:56.293 --> 00:21:56.794
You got lost?

00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:59.340
What the heck?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:21:59.821
BAU BAU!

00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:06.797
And at the end of that...

00:22:06.777 --> 00:22:08.759
Moco-chan, you're just gonna go on like that?

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.241
There's more things that happen!

00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:11.862
Go ahead.

00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:13.584
I got lost in the tank, you know.

00:22:14.404 --> 00:22:16.807
You got lost too, just like the Ruffians.

00:22:16.827 --> 00:22:17.327
Very lost.

00:22:17.668 --> 00:22:20.550
Well, we learned some very special techniques.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.793
Like castling, right Moco-chan?

00:22:24.554 --> 00:22:25.475
Right, eventually.

00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:26.877
And we learned that.

00:22:27.197 --> 00:22:30.340
And we had a very specific plan all of Advent.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.022
This will happen, Moco-chan.

00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:34.724
You are going to be the part that I'm not good at.

00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:36.666
Doing the castling part.

00:22:37.287 --> 00:22:37.933
I'm done!

00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:40.193
Do it a bit.

00:22:40.949 --> 00:22:43.411
Something happened and it was not my fault.

00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:44.312
It wasn't your fault.

00:22:44.832 --> 00:22:45.633
Whose fault was it?

00:22:45.954 --> 00:22:47.435
Nerissa's.

00:22:47.655 --> 00:22:49.317
It wasn't Nerissa's fault, Moco-chan!

00:22:49.337 --> 00:22:50.478
I didn't blame it on Nerissa.

00:22:50.638 --> 00:22:52.740
It wasn't a technical issue, right?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.362
Then it was Shiori's.

00:22:55.382 --> 00:22:56.963
It was a technical issue.

00:22:57.444 --> 00:22:59.265
It was, it was... Yeah.

00:22:59.286 --> 00:23:02.649
Moco-chan, she said that maybe Fuwawa's fault.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.231
It was a technical one.

00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:06.812
Moco-chan, you were wrong, right?

00:23:06.832 --> 00:23:09.455
I was not wrong, I did exactly right.

00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:10.956
All of it was just a shock.

00:23:10.936 --> 00:23:28.472
Hi.

00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:32.197
But it was a lot of fun!

00:23:32.698 --> 00:23:41.430
And for the lessons, we also had Aoi-senpai as MC and for the actual tournament we had Calli-senpai as MC as well!

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.673
Amazing job by the two of them!

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:45.355
Calli-senpai said she was like a DJ.

00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:49.701
Right, and she was just supposed to be an MC but she was a DJ MC.

00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:51.158
Yeah.

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:59.165
One thing that's a little bit embarrassing though is that Advent, I think a lot of us thought that you could not hear us.

00:23:59.185 --> 00:24:00.606
So we're just being really silly.

00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:02.748
But focused, but silly.

00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:08.573
Like we usually are all just together.

00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:12.177
So... Yeah.

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:15.019
You can sometimes hear, we're just like, oh, you can't hear us.

00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:19.063
When you two did it was extra silly.

00:24:19.803 --> 00:24:20.924
That's how it goes.

00:24:20.944 --> 00:24:22.566
That's how we do it.

00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:34.919
But even though we lost on purpose, we had a lot of fun!

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:39.824
And it was really nice to MC recently FUWAMOCO!

00:24:40.264 --> 00:24:43.988
We had something really nice happen!

00:24:43.968 --> 00:24:50.398
We heard that a certain zombie happens to be a little bit of an early riser.

00:24:50.859 --> 00:24:56.368
So we went for breakfast together with Aoi-senpai!

00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:57.449
It was really nice!

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.538
Sharing pancakes together and just chatting about silly things.

00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:05.502
You know what's funny?

00:25:06.884 --> 00:25:07.225
I...

00:25:08.335 --> 00:25:10.698
I had a hot chocolate.

00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:13.942
I never ever drink hot chocolate.

00:25:13.983 --> 00:25:16.586
Aoi-senpai and I, we both got matcha.

00:25:16.606 --> 00:25:21.593
I felt like I was going to throw up.

00:25:21.613 --> 00:25:21.993
It was good though!

00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:22.854
Was it good?

00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:23.816
It was good though!

00:25:24.997 --> 00:25:25.818
Very decadent.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.021
First thing in the morning?

00:25:29.243 --> 00:25:34.270
Nomadeca.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:34.390
Yeah.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:34.630
Yeah.

00:25:35.622 --> 00:25:36.524
But it was nice.

00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:38.950
And that was chess.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.073
Um, that was chess.

00:25:40.093 --> 00:25:41.156
But the announcement!

00:25:41.476 --> 00:25:41.877
Yes!

00:25:42.078 --> 00:25:46.148
At the end of the 10 events, there was an exciting announcement!

00:25:46.869 --> 00:25:47.812
Wow!

00:25:48.273 --> 00:25:49.195
There's not one!

00:25:49.235 --> 00:25:50.779
Mushi-kun!

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:57.187
Advent Vs. Justice and the very first chapter was just released on the hololive English official channel.

00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:58.789
You can go and please check it out there.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:06.640
It is 12 minutes and very cinematic, very amazing, beautiful art by Yomosaka-sensei.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:06.860
Yes!

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.581
Amazing!

00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:09.103
Thank you!

00:26:09.503 --> 00:26:15.391
Yeah, if you want to learn more about, you know, Advent and Justice back when we were in the cell, this is for you.

00:26:16.092 --> 00:26:19.416
And if you go comment on our pinned comment,

00:26:19.717 --> 00:26:21.119
No, you probably want to see an anime.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:22.120
We want to see an anime.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.621
Maybe.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:23.462
Maybe.

00:26:23.703 --> 00:26:26.166
Don't you think it'll be cool?

00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:27.648
I'm just saying, you know, anime.

00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:28.850
Anime.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.990
Right.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.954
You know, Advent versus Justice, the animation.

00:26:33.356 --> 00:26:34.838
Titles, it's done.

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.620
Confirmed.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.121
No, no confirmed.

00:26:37.201 --> 00:26:38.703
Can we get a better title?

00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:39.244
Thank you.

00:26:40.034 --> 00:26:47.884
Please go take a look!

00:26:47.904 --> 00:26:53.872
There's gonna be a new chapter every month being released on the hololive English official channel!

00:26:54.152 --> 00:26:56.615
So please stay tuned for more!

00:26:56.936 --> 00:26:59.579
You know, you might think, oh 12 minutes, wow, that's quite sizable.

00:26:59.979 --> 00:27:03.904
Goes by in a flash, so please take a look!

00:27:05.587 --> 00:27:05.907
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:13.845
And maybe not so hololive news, but still hololive news!

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:14.707
FUWAMOCO news!

00:27:14.727 --> 00:27:15.067
FUWAMOCO news!

00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:19.033
Well, we had something silly happen.

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.797
On a movie trip together!

00:27:21.897 --> 00:27:22.638
Movie trip!

00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:23.919
A trip to the movie theater!

00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:27.284
It wasn't meant for... not for us.

00:27:27.304 --> 00:27:27.945
It's a trip.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:34.495
The first time in FOREVER we went to see a movie in the theaters!

00:27:34.896 --> 00:27:43.656
And that's because the last movie we saw in theaters was Kimi no Na wa.

00:27:44.193 --> 00:27:59.215
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:18.773
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:42.330
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:57.332
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:57.312 --> 00:28:58.654
No seatbelts?

00:28:58.994 --> 00:28:59.575
No seatbelts.

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:00.916
I would have appreciated that.

00:29:00.936 --> 00:29:06.503
Yeah, but there was a big warning being like you could probably spill your drinks and your food, so... Yeah, be prepared.

00:29:06.523 --> 00:29:07.785
That's the risk you take here.

00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:11.489
But it was a very good movie!

00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.609
Yeah!

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.194
You know, if you have the chance, I think it's worth going to see.

00:29:15.594 --> 00:29:16.175
Yeah!

00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:19.939
But, you know, when you go to the movie theater, you can't pop in.

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:27.268
Yeah, and we were really surprised because, uh, I know back in the Makai, there's movie theaters, but

00:29:28.396 --> 00:29:30.439
It's very, very, very expensive.

00:29:30.459 --> 00:29:32.201
Very expensive.

00:29:32.782 --> 00:29:38.329
And just so you know, we got a huge popcorn bucket like this big.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.992
It was too big.

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:41.614
Massive popcorn bucket.

00:29:42.295 --> 00:29:44.357
And two big drinks.

00:29:44.438 --> 00:29:46.761
Yeah.

00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:50.486
It was... Not even $10.

00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:52.969
Yeah.

00:29:54.097 --> 00:29:55.600
How to say popcorn in Japanese?

00:29:56.682 --> 00:29:56.942
Popcorn!

00:29:57.423 --> 00:29:59.427
It's easy!

00:29:59.447 --> 00:29:59.527
Wow!

00:30:00.128 --> 00:30:00.930
Popcorn!

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.460
It could have had different flavors like caramel or like butter and shoyu.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.522
Whatever you want.

00:30:07.622 --> 00:30:08.684
Other things.

00:30:09.025 --> 00:30:09.826
Do it with salt.

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.329
Yeah.

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:17.395
But, you know, it was so nice having FUWAMOCO for the first time in a long time too.

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:21.079
Moco-chan, you were kind of hogging it all to yourself.

00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:21.719
I was not!

00:30:21.739 --> 00:30:21.919
You were!

00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:22.560
I didn't get to eat any.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.124
The movie was really quiet so we had to stop before the movie started.

00:30:26.604 --> 00:30:29.247
But... I held onto the bucket, okay?

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:32.570
Okay, and... You did eat some.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.652
Because... There was an incident.

00:30:35.132 --> 00:30:36.133
There is an incident.

00:30:36.153 --> 00:30:36.794
It's ongoing.

00:30:38.055 --> 00:30:38.756
It's ongoing-san.

00:30:38.776 --> 00:30:39.797
Oh, Moco-chan.

00:30:41.127 --> 00:30:48.193
Well... I have, you know, the pop of the- the part of the popcorn.

00:30:48.493 --> 00:30:50.635
But the popcorn?

00:30:50.655 --> 00:30:51.236
The part of the popcorn.

00:30:51.576 --> 00:30:53.517
The little- the shell of the kernel.

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:54.338
Yeah.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.701
It's stuck in the back of my throat.

00:30:58.742 --> 00:30:59.683
And I can't get it out.

00:31:01.825 --> 00:31:04.647
I have tried so hard before the movie started.

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:06.889
I was like, ah, it's stuck back there, you know?

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:08.890
So I was like, okay, I'll drink water.

00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:10.712
I'll drink water, I'll drink the drink.

00:31:11.755 --> 00:31:12.035
Now.

00:31:12.055 --> 00:31:12.316
No.

00:31:12.816 --> 00:31:13.257
I tried.

00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:15.880
I didn't choke, it's just stuck there.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.001
And then I tried eating more.

00:31:17.662 --> 00:31:18.363
Still stuck.

00:31:18.383 --> 00:31:18.843
Go back.

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:19.904
Dig gargle.

00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:20.445
No.

00:31:20.885 --> 00:31:21.406
Still stuck.

00:31:22.728 --> 00:31:23.248
Drink tea.

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:24.630
Still stuck.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.090
Eat food.

00:31:25.311 --> 00:31:25.811
Still stuck.

00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:26.592
Talk lots.

00:31:26.812 --> 00:31:27.513
Still stuck.

00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:28.074
Sing a bit.

00:31:28.334 --> 00:31:28.855
Still stuck.

00:31:29.475 --> 00:31:31.478
You know, all this stuff.

00:31:31.498 --> 00:31:31.858
I tried.

00:31:31.878 --> 00:31:32.739
And?

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:34.221
I said cough really hard.

00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:35.402
I coughed really hard.

00:31:35.422 --> 00:31:37.965
I tried to get it out.

00:31:37.945 --> 00:31:38.926
Toothbrush.

00:31:40.007 --> 00:31:45.993
Moco-chan keeps on asking Fuwawa help me!

00:31:46.153 --> 00:31:48.555
I'm not gonna help you!

00:31:48.595 --> 00:31:49.356
Don't throw up!

00:31:49.456 --> 00:31:50.457
Don't throw up!

00:31:51.518 --> 00:31:52.799
Moco-chan!

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:57.824
It won't come out!

00:31:58.725 --> 00:31:59.265
I don't know!

00:31:59.485 --> 00:32:00.206
Natto?

00:32:00.226 --> 00:32:01.627
Natto you sure?

00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:02.528
Natto is sticky.

00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:03.129
Did it try sneezing?

00:32:03.329 --> 00:32:07.733
What did I just do?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.301
It won't come out.

00:32:10.022 --> 00:32:10.702
And I'm worried.

00:32:11.123 --> 00:32:12.484
I have to call the doctor.

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.247
You don't need to go to the doctor.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:16.789
I can't see it, but I know it's there.

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:19.071
Are you sure it's actually there now?

00:32:19.251 --> 00:32:19.712
I'm sure.

00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:20.472
I'm sure.

00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:21.794
You know, I can feel it.

00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:22.935
Maybe it's just in your mind.

00:32:22.955 --> 00:32:26.659
No, it's there!

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:28.000
It'll go away after a bit.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.121
I think so too.

00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:34.287
Moco-chan's just, you know, very pessimistic at times.

00:32:35.188 --> 00:32:36.929
It's scratchy!

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.450
It's scratchy!

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.796
She's asking for my help lots!

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:45.879
She won't do anything!

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:49.004
Can you shine a light and see if you see something?

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:49.705
She goes, no!

00:32:50.506 --> 00:32:55.534
Ruffians, what do you do if Moco-chan comes up to you and asks for help like that?

00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:57.157
Just laugh at her.

00:32:58.859 --> 00:32:59.921
You're good, Moco-chan.

00:32:59.941 --> 00:33:00.742
You're good!

00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:02.144
Shiori should take a look.

00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:04.568
She'd probably be amused.

00:33:05.054 --> 00:33:06.215
Help!

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:08.899
What can you do to help them realistically?

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:09.379
Give her a hug!

00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:10.140
Have pants!

00:33:11.282 --> 00:33:12.203
Thank you.

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.364
Moco-chan, you want a hug right now?

00:33:13.384 --> 00:33:14.326
I don't need a hug.

00:33:14.346 --> 00:33:16.628
I'm like... No!

00:33:16.648 --> 00:33:16.809
No!

00:33:17.369 --> 00:33:18.871
Just a really strong hug!

00:33:19.552 --> 00:33:19.913
No!

00:33:21.454 --> 00:33:21.895
I tried!

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:23.076
I tried the gargle!

00:33:23.377 --> 00:33:24.238
Not with salt water!

00:33:24.358 --> 00:33:24.578
No!

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:26.020
That's just gross.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.084
That sounds good though.

00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:30.265
No.

00:33:30.285 --> 00:33:30.886
So... Let's hope for the best!

00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:32.809
Shrink down and fight!

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.930
What?

00:33:35.328 --> 00:33:38.393
BAU BAU!

00:33:38.553 --> 00:33:40.817
You're good!

00:33:41.618 --> 00:33:43.401
We had fun.

00:33:43.441 --> 00:33:46.166
Popcorn was yummy!

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:49.050
BAU BAU!

00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:54.459
Well, there's also another announcement from hololive English.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.327
About something very mysterious.

00:34:00.016 --> 00:34:02.559
hololive Nexus Gate.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.162
What is this?

00:34:05.982 --> 00:34:10.447
Yes, the hololive English official pop-up store!

00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:13.831
The Chronicles of hololive English The Nexus Gate.

00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:14.131
Act 1.

00:34:14.171 --> 00:34:15.633
The Portal Awakens.

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:26.705
It will be starting October 6th to November 2nd and happening at the American Dream Shopping Mall in New Jersey!

00:34:26.725 --> 00:34:26.985
Pop-up store!

00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:30.652
New Jersey!

00:34:30.832 --> 00:34:49.328
New Jersey!

00:34:49.747 --> 00:34:57.962
New toys, awesome merchandise sales, and meet and greet events starring hololive English talents!

00:34:58.744 --> 00:35:06.318
And it's all gonna be set around the theme of the next Escape Act 1, the Portal Awakens theme.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.681
What is this?

00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:08.903
What is this?

00:35:09.254 --> 00:35:10.376
Do you know what this is?

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:11.337
Do you know what this is?

00:35:11.357 --> 00:35:12.058
Well, there's a gate.

00:35:12.278 --> 00:35:14.401
I don't know what nexus means, but there's a gate.

00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:15.343
Do you know what it is?

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:16.865
I guess that also means like a portal?

00:35:17.546 --> 00:35:17.806
Chronicles?

00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:18.367
I don't know.

00:35:19.308 --> 00:35:20.210
Do I know what this is?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.431
It's an intense theme.

00:35:21.451 --> 00:35:21.952
It's something.

00:35:22.092 --> 00:35:27.600
Now, maybe I'll go through this gate and that's how we do the meet and greets?

00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:29.463
That'd be cool.

00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:31.925
It's like a dokodemo door.

00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:32.486
Dokodemo door!

00:35:33.127 --> 00:35:34.228
That'd be cool.

00:35:34.248 --> 00:35:36.210
There'll be more details soon.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.514
But FUWAMOCO, we really hope that we'll be part of the chosen ones.

00:35:40.534 --> 00:35:43.457
To see you at the Nexus Gate in New Jersey.

00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:45.840
What's happening in New Jersey?

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.081
Nexus Gate.

00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:49.483
Nobody knows.

00:35:50.264 --> 00:35:52.667
BAU BAU!

00:35:52.687 --> 00:35:53.227
It's important!

00:35:53.247 --> 00:35:55.950
You have to unveil the mystery.

00:35:59.137 --> 00:36:03.942
BAU BAU!

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:04.123
BAU BAU!

00:36:06.746 --> 00:36:15.115
You know, such big exciting things we just had off for one, now miss anniversary, and then a 3D concert!

00:36:15.135 --> 00:36:17.998
And now, next is game.

00:36:18.018 --> 00:36:18.539
New toys.

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:21.022
It's gonna be a good week, Ruffians!

00:36:23.304 --> 00:36:26.728
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are still feeling a little bit unsure of FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:36:27.629 --> 00:36:27.709
Hai.

00:36:28.668 --> 00:36:29.729
Is it a key to the Makai?

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:30.030
No.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.031
No.

00:36:31.151 --> 00:36:32.313
No.

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:35.858
No.

00:36:35.938 --> 00:36:39.162
Okay, that's it.

00:36:39.182 --> 00:36:40.684
Chippity-chop-chop done now.

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:48.915
Pup Talk!

00:36:48.935 --> 00:36:50.377
Pup Talk!

00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:53.521
Pup Talk.

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.083
You wanna Pup Talk that bad?

00:36:57.466 --> 00:36:57.747
Yeah.

00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:58.067
Okay.

00:36:58.672 --> 00:37:18.334
BAU BAU!

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:37.032
BAU BAU!

00:37:37.855 --> 00:38:00.133

00:38:23.128 --> 00:38:23.809
BAU BAU!

00:38:24.346 --> 00:38:27.609
So many really deeply touched Ruffians!

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.732
BAU BAU!

00:38:31.554 --> 00:38:32.995
Thank you!

00:38:33.496 --> 00:38:39.062
Let's take a look at some very special corners on the Ruffians.

00:38:39.462 --> 00:38:42.986
First we have the Doggie of the Day!

00:38:43.046 --> 00:38:48.412
These doggies, they are... De-den!

00:38:49.713 --> 00:38:49.813
Cute!

00:38:50.738 --> 00:38:59.370
If I don't have a name... Today's Doggie of the Day is... FUNNY DEMON DOG!

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.974
BAU BAU!

00:39:02.494 --> 00:39:04.197
She looks a little shy.

00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:05.639
A little concerned.

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:06.300
Cute dog.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.304
Maybe she's, you know, camera shyness.

00:39:09.284 --> 00:39:12.587
That makes sense, you know.

00:39:12.607 --> 00:39:17.612
She likes trees, huh?

00:39:18.113 --> 00:39:18.213
Cute.

00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:18.914
FUWAMOCO!

00:39:20.195 --> 00:39:21.556
A third sister?

00:39:22.117 --> 00:39:22.618
I don't know.

00:39:23.558 --> 00:39:27.382
We'd be happy to have a third sister out of... No, she's this cute.

00:39:27.402 --> 00:39:28.403
Her name is Peggy.

00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:34.269
Peggy!

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:34.630
Cute.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.632
Peggy aka furry demon dog.

00:39:36.652 --> 00:39:37.873
It's a bit long, but...

00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:39.895
What?

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:40.335
What?

00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:44.639
I was gonna say, you know, Peggy's a demon dog.

00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:44.739
Huh?

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:48.923
I was thinking maybe we have to get a test to see if she's an actual demon dog.

00:39:48.943 --> 00:39:50.724
But now that we know this is Peggy.

00:39:50.864 --> 00:39:51.325
Peggy!

00:39:51.525 --> 00:39:52.366
We don't need a test.

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:54.688
Yeah?

00:39:54.748 --> 00:40:01.734
She just looks like a cute, cute... Peg.

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:01.914
BAU BAU!

00:40:01.934 --> 00:40:03.155
How does Peggy BAU BAU?

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.220
What?

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:08.620
BAU BAU.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.505
BAU BAU!

00:40:13.813 --> 00:40:15.906
Has a guest waiting to be greeted?

00:40:16.952 --> 00:40:17.918
BAU BAU!

00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:27.938
You have the food!

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:41.998
She is happy.

00:40:41.978 --> 00:40:45.865
She likes, you know?

00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:48.169
All the good things.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.233
Happy dog stuff.

00:40:50.253 --> 00:40:53.639
BAU BAU!

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.582
Thank you!

00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:57.726
BAU BAU!

00:40:58.178 --> 00:41:00.540
We have our other corner.

00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:01.882
Today I went on a walk.

00:41:01.982 --> 00:41:04.525
What do you mean other corner, Moco-chan?

00:41:04.985 --> 00:41:06.306
Today I went on a walk.

00:41:06.747 --> 00:41:09.730
Ruffians, let's see what you've been going on a walk, huh?

00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:11.812
De-den!

00:41:12.773 --> 00:41:15.175
A fishing trip!

00:41:15.195 --> 00:41:16.016
Sunset fishing!

00:41:16.036 --> 00:41:18.419
Fishing right in front of my dad.

00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:19.400
Moco-chan's sunset?

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.322
I thought it looked like a sunset.

00:41:21.342 --> 00:41:22.583
I don't think you usually go...

00:41:23.457 --> 00:41:25.099
Fishing at sunset?

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:26.081
You can't!

00:41:26.221 --> 00:41:27.002
But I don't think like this.

00:41:27.182 --> 00:41:29.706
It looks like a sunset.

00:41:29.726 --> 00:41:31.168
I think it's dawn, you know.

00:41:31.648 --> 00:41:33.310
But the fish weren't biting.

00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:35.393
Oh, maybe you should have went to sunset!

00:41:37.136 --> 00:41:38.177
Why, Moco-chan?

00:41:38.217 --> 00:41:39.879
What is there to get at sunset?

00:41:39.899 --> 00:41:40.901
Maybe the fish would have been biting at sunset!

00:41:40.921 --> 00:41:42.323
I think it's more dangerous at sunset.

00:41:42.984 --> 00:41:48.371
But, Ruffians, isn't there like a saying about like the red dawn?

00:41:49.292 --> 00:41:51.996
And that maybe it's not good to go fishing then, right?

00:41:53.123 --> 00:41:53.664
Mococo Sky.

00:41:53.704 --> 00:41:55.286
This is Red Dawn Sky.

00:41:55.326 --> 00:41:56.828
Don't go fishing.

00:41:58.831 --> 00:41:58.951
Bye.

00:41:59.011 --> 00:42:00.053
Mococo Sky.

00:42:00.073 --> 00:42:03.497
I'm trying to rhyme, I don't know.

00:42:04.499 --> 00:42:05.420
Red Sky Morning.

00:42:05.821 --> 00:42:06.842
Sailors take warning.

00:42:07.823 --> 00:42:07.964
Ow.

00:42:08.084 --> 00:42:09.686
Maybe that's why there's no fish.

00:42:10.707 --> 00:42:11.048
Yeah.

00:42:11.709 --> 00:42:16.876
Caught no fish, but it's okay because I see you caught lots of memories instead.

00:42:17.216 --> 00:42:18.598
BAU BAU!

00:42:18.618 --> 00:42:19.800
You don't call me lots of laughs.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.983
You're like, there's no fish.

00:42:22.452 --> 00:42:26.139
Yeah, maybe you know, caught dad's heart or something.

00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:27.120
Caught dad's heart.

00:42:28.343 --> 00:42:30.987
I'm sure that was already caught many many years before.

00:42:31.228 --> 00:42:32.270
You already did it.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.333
You didn't even have to go fishing.

00:42:35.115 --> 00:42:37.238
BAU BAU!

00:42:37.258 --> 00:42:38.921
Oh, sometimes it's actually a good time to fish.

00:42:40.084 --> 00:42:41.967
I wanna go fishing!

00:42:42.428 --> 00:42:45.133
I still wanna go fishing, Ruffians!

00:42:45.473 --> 00:42:46.375
I wanna go fishing.

00:42:46.415 --> 00:42:47.076
Yeah.

00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:49.343
BAU BAU!

00:42:49.503 --> 00:42:50.484
Nature's gotcha.

00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:58.852
Our next corner is today's Question of the Day!

00:42:59.572 --> 00:43:02.915
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:43:04.837 --> 00:43:05.077
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:43:05.197 --> 00:43:08.980
Lately you've been appearing in all sorts of recordings and sessions.

00:43:09.301 --> 00:43:12.824
Have you been able to connect with other holomers in the studio and such?

00:43:13.304 --> 00:43:17.788
I'm really looking forward to seeing lots of collaborations in the future!

00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:36.283
BAU BAU!

00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:38.065
Chatting with Ririka.

00:43:38.465 --> 00:43:39.987
Matsuri-senpai.

00:43:40.127 --> 00:43:42.890
Of course, you know, just have a day!

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.154
Bae-senpai, IRyS-senpai, Calli-senpai.

00:43:46.654 --> 00:43:47.535
Bunch of people.

00:43:47.555 --> 00:43:49.017
It's hot in here.

00:43:49.037 --> 00:43:50.499
It's really hot.

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:53.041
But it's a... Senchou-senpai, too.

00:43:53.081 --> 00:43:54.423
Mikocchi-senpai.

00:43:54.443 --> 00:43:55.364
Korone-senpai.

00:43:55.644 --> 00:43:59.028
Biboo ran in us before, too.

00:43:59.048 --> 00:44:00.610

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.290

00:44:02.672 --> 00:44:03.773
Lots of senpai.

00:44:03.753 --> 00:44:23.726
I don't think so.

00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:26.130
I don't think so.

00:44:29.355 --> 00:44:30.317
I really don't think so.

00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:36.260

00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:48.616
We dance together with Choco-senpai.

00:44:48.636 --> 00:44:49.678
Are you sure we met all of FUWAMOCO?

00:44:49.698 --> 00:44:51.100
Yes, multiple times.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.065
We met all of FUWAMOCO all at once.

00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:57.248
Ayame-senpai, we will dance the solo dance!

00:44:57.268 --> 00:44:57.368
Yeah!

00:44:57.719 --> 00:45:09.180
Have you met FUWAMOCO?

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:15.568
I don't think I'm familiar with Mococo, but I do know Fuwawa.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.692
Sometimes people say, are you Mococo?

00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:21.456
No, I'm Fuwawa.

00:45:23.078 --> 00:45:25.662

00:45:25.682 --> 00:45:28.446
We're looking forward to even more special moments in the future.

You never know what's going to happen, huh?

00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:35.275
Kanade, yes, of course!

00:45:36.537 --> 00:45:38.880
Well, beings don't believe us, huh?

00:45:39.316 --> 00:45:48.411
Nodoka yes!

00:45:48.591 --> 00:45:55.562

We talked about a bunch of different things with Luna-senpai.

00:45:58.587 --> 00:46:01.351
Of course, you know, there's fast and everything too!

00:46:02.073 --> 00:46:04.176

Remember, please do not forget, FUWAMOCO Morning is something we make together with you, Ruffians.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:55.057
So, we need you to share with us with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:46:55.457 --> 00:46:57.940
Please let us know what kind of walk has you been going on.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.383
Maybe there is something new on your walking path.

00:47:00.423 --> 00:47:02.105
What is this?

00:47:02.165 --> 00:47:03.306
Is that about us?

00:47:03.286 --> 00:47:05.429
Or maybe it's just a piece of paper.

00:47:05.729 --> 00:47:06.129
Share it!

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.910

00:47:12.857 --> 00:47:13.879
But we need to know.

00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:14.980
