05:36.682 --> 05:39.924
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.964 --> 05:41.544
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:49.838 --> 05:53.099
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:53.599 --> 05:56.560
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:56.861 --> 05:59.602
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:59.662 --> 06:01.443
BAU BAU!

06:01.923 --> 06:05.484
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:06.125 --> 06:06.785
BAU BAU!

06:07.765 --> 06:08.845
Ruffians!

06:09.365 --> 06:11.266
Bye bye!

06:12.006 --> 06:13.006
Thank you!

06:13.086 --> 06:15.547
Thank you for joining us again!

06:16.467 --> 06:22.509
Especially today, it's our 122nd episode!

06:22.889 --> 06:24.049
BAU BAU!

06:24.129 --> 06:25.629
Good number!

06:25.909 --> 06:27.230
BAU BAU!

06:27.650 --> 06:30.310
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:30.390 --> 06:33.571
Back to regular schedule!

06:33.651 --> 06:35.372
It feels like it's been forever huh?

06:36.792 --> 06:41.735
There's been so many things going on, so... Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us!

06:41.835 --> 06:42.636
Especially now!

06:43.096 --> 06:47.439
Summer is now officially ended, and now it's time for something new!

06:48.159 --> 06:52.942
Thank you for continuing to join us despite new things going on too!

06:54.363 --> 06:55.524
BAU BAU!

06:55.885 --> 07:00.608
Well, maybe there's some Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time.

07:00.688 --> 07:08.435
Well, to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:08.735 --> 07:09.916
AKA FUWAMOCO!

07:10.056 --> 07:10.957
It's FUWAMOCO.

07:11.377 --> 07:13.719
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

07:15.460 --> 07:21.023
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:21.343 --> 07:28.107
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:28.507 --> 07:32.289
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:32.309 --> 07:35.870
BAU BAU!

07:35.890 --> 07:39.592
Are you happy we're back?

07:40.373 --> 07:41.333
I'm happy, Ruffians.

07:43.455 --> 07:44.656
FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:44.736 --> 07:46.517
It's been a while, FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:46.617 --> 07:46.877
I'm back!

07:46.977 --> 07:47.317
I'm back!

07:47.337 --> 07:53.241
You're the first FUWAMOCO Morning in a little while!

07:53.781 --> 07:55.582
Thank you, Ruffians!

07:56.403 --> 07:57.864
Wow, you know what?

07:57.884 --> 08:01.666
There's been so many exciting things going on for FUWAMOCO.

08:02.106 --> 08:02.747
Going up?

08:02.807 --> 08:03.587
Going on!

08:03.607 --> 08:03.908
Going on!

08:03.928 --> 08:04.908
Going on, going on.

08:05.749 --> 08:07.670
So, let's check them out!

08:08.771 --> 08:09.371
Good job!

08:09.771 --> 08:10.932
That's what I like to see.

08:15.058 --> 08:22.622
Well... It's hard to say, but... What's hard to say?

08:22.642 --> 08:25.563
There's been another Pero sighting.

08:26.424 --> 08:27.004
Why?

08:27.264 --> 08:28.085
Why?

08:28.485 --> 08:29.125
Why?

08:29.145 --> 08:31.006
I haven't seen Pero for a while!

08:32.267 --> 08:33.948
I haven't seen him, that's so useful.

08:36.229 --> 08:39.490
Well, let's see where he was spotted this time.

08:39.650 --> 08:40.211
Okay.

08:41.031 --> 08:41.351
Okay.

08:41.952 --> 08:42.752
De-den!

08:45.233 --> 08:46.253
Huh?

08:46.734 --> 08:48.054
What the heck?

08:48.454 --> 08:50.695
Why is Pero here?

08:50.835 --> 08:52.996
And Sidewalk Chalk.

08:53.336 --> 09:05.320
I guess, you know, Sidewalk Chalk is a fun summer activity, but it is Pero getting innocent children to draw flattering images, flattering portraits of him.

09:05.340 --> 09:10.242
It does look pretty good here.

09:11.471 --> 09:16.233
What happens to the children afterwards, you know, after they finish the portraits?

09:17.773 --> 09:18.774
Despicable.

09:20.094 --> 09:20.954
I don't know.

09:21.655 --> 09:27.957
I don't know, we can only hope Ruffians maybe they have some leftover pudding on them or... Eat stone.

09:29.782 --> 09:30.162
Pudding.

09:30.562 --> 09:30.842
Pudding.

09:30.882 --> 09:31.722
He likes pudding.

09:32.062 --> 09:35.183
Everyone likes pudding and Sighting and Rock Talk together, right?

09:35.223 --> 09:35.563
Yeah.

09:35.603 --> 09:36.883
The best summer, right?

09:36.923 --> 09:37.684
Right, yeah!

09:37.744 --> 09:40.604
It's not like the children would be hungry and eat the pudding.

09:40.624 --> 09:40.664
No.

09:41.184 --> 09:43.565
Yeah, but this is such a good drawing.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.505
Yeah, right!

09:45.005 --> 09:48.786
He looks very cute, almost.

09:49.626 --> 09:50.526
Very round.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.706
Perfectly round.

09:51.726 --> 09:54.967
I can only think of our poor children.

09:57.966 --> 09:59.146
We have pudding, I'm sure.

09:59.306 --> 09:59.727
I'm sure.

09:59.747 --> 10:01.627
Let's hope children have pudding on them.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.047
Yeah.

10:02.307 --> 10:02.588
Yeah.

10:03.988 --> 10:06.289
BAU BAU!

10:06.469 --> 10:06.809
BAU BAU!

10:07.049 --> 10:09.950
Pero's a good baby, so as long as there's pudding, it's alright.

10:10.890 --> 10:11.771
Pudding and pudding.

10:12.191 --> 10:13.111
BAU BAU!

10:13.251 --> 10:14.992
It's for the best, okay?

10:15.032 --> 10:15.572
For the best.

10:16.667 --> 10:17.227
Wow!

10:17.367 --> 10:19.008
Happy new year!

10:19.428 --> 10:22.050
BAU BAU!

10:22.170 --> 10:26.832
Good news, Ruffians!

10:26.852 --> 10:28.293
FUWAMOCO!

10:28.553 --> 10:35.577
We just released our first original song at the beginning of August as part of our first anniversary!

10:36.057 --> 10:37.918
Just about a month ago now!

10:40.339 --> 10:42.800
It's Born to be Balladol!

10:42.900 --> 10:46.502
And it's a very energetic, very FUWAMOCO song.

10:46.562 --> 10:50.463
It's like if you just kind of balled us all up and put us into a song.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.944
Thanks to you!

10:53.705 --> 10:57.666
Born to be Balladol has actually reached over 500,000 views!

10:57.686 --> 10:58.367
BAU BAU!

10:58.387 --> 10:59.447
Thank you!

10:59.527 --> 11:02.848
Thank you so much!

11:02.908 --> 11:04.229

11:04.269 --> 11:05.850
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:07.191 --> 11:08.652
Thank you!

11:09.032 --> 11:17.259
You know, it means so so much to us because it's our original song and we're just so happy that you're listening to it live.

11:17.299 --> 11:18.661
That you're enjoying it!

11:18.721 --> 11:28.389
Yeah, and I'm sure you know not just listening to it but singing along, dancing, and most importantly, BAU BAU-ing at the same time too!

11:28.409 --> 11:29.870
A lot of those views are from you.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.092
I'm sure hot.

11:32.112 --> 11:32.892
Thank you.

11:33.032 --> 11:34.412
All 500,000 of them!

11:34.612 --> 11:43.396
Yeah, you know, Balladol, it means so much to us, and it really means the world that you love it so much, Ruffians.

11:44.816 --> 11:45.237
Thank you.

11:45.257 --> 11:47.157
It's really fun!

11:47.257 --> 11:48.418
It's beating your head!

11:49.198 --> 11:53.860
Omochis, you put the sacred book on her head too, apparently.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.961
She kept on being like, Fuwafuwaa.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.201
Mocomoco.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.900
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.801
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

12:22.985 --> 12:24.586
I don't know about that one, Moco-chan.

12:25.306 --> 12:26.607
Maybe.

12:26.647 --> 12:29.869
BAU BAU in your sleep, baby.

12:30.349 --> 12:37.393
But hopefully, one day, we hope that it can reach 1 million listens here on YouTube soon!

12:38.333 --> 12:46.198
So Ruffians, please make sure you continue to dance along, practice your moves, and BAU BAU together lots with it, okay?

12:46.698 --> 12:47.839
Okay, Ruffians!

12:48.479 --> 12:49.159
Gonna promise.

12:51.498 --> 12:51.698
Yeah!

12:51.718 --> 12:51.919

B

13:06.942 --> 13:19.891
I'm sure you know that just a little bit more than a week ago, all of hololive English, we were in New York for our second concert, BREAKING DIMENSIONS!

13:20.212 --> 13:24.855
Of course too, FUWAMOCO, we had to perform our original song.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.896
We had to perform BAU BAU there.

13:27.477 --> 13:28.357
We decided this.

13:28.437 --> 13:29.198
Nobody made it.

13:31.009 --> 13:32.391
Yeah, did you see?

13:32.751 --> 13:34.452
Yeah, did you see?

13:34.512 --> 13:35.353
Look, Ruffians!

13:36.094 --> 13:37.595
All your fans!

13:38.176 --> 13:39.637
Thank you!

13:40.418 --> 13:42.580
See a pink and blue!

13:42.660 --> 13:44.361
FUWAMOCO colors!

13:45.222 --> 13:47.024
Thank you, Ruffians!

13:47.724 --> 13:48.145
Thank you!

13:48.445 --> 13:49.345
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:49.365 --> 13:50.346
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:50.406 --> 13:51.286
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:51.306 --> 13:52.106
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:52.146 --> 13:52.766
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:07.110 --> 14:09.452
Thank you Ruffians!

14:09.492 --> 14:10.793
Thank you!

14:11.033 --> 14:16.277
If you missed it, you can check it out on SPWN on Spawn or Streaming.

14:16.497 --> 14:19.079
Also you can get streaming tickets in the archives too.

14:19.479 --> 14:26.464
Or you can also check out there's a bit of a sneak peek over on the hololive English YouTube channel.

14:26.484 --> 14:31.227
And there might be some good things there if you check it out.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.928
Like there's a reason we can show this to you.

14:33.188 --> 14:34.768
You lost your voice!

14:34.788 --> 14:36.569
That's good!

14:36.609 --> 14:38.309
Thank you Ruffians.

14:38.369 --> 14:41.570
It really was a dream come true to us, you know.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.451
Just seeing that- Oh!

14:43.551 --> 14:44.911
The penlights too!

14:44.971 --> 14:45.612
Look at them!

14:45.692 --> 14:48.052
Hearing your big BAU BAU's in person.

15:04.019 --> 15:05.260
You screamed so much!

15:08.157 --> 15:09.798
We'll never forget it!

15:09.878 --> 15:11.860
And we'll keep on waking live for next time!

15:11.880 --> 15:13.541
If there is ever a next time!

15:13.621 --> 15:15.422
Hopefully a next time again!

15:16.042 --> 15:17.783
It's not a given, okay?

15:18.204 --> 15:24.608
We really hope that one day we can stand on an even bigger stage right in front of you!

15:24.628 --> 15:28.711
And we can BAU BAU and have even more fun together, that's true.

15:29.491 --> 15:30.832
Thank you Ruffians!

15:30.852 --> 15:31.392
Thank you!

15:31.833 --> 15:32.213
BAU BAU!

15:34.272 --> 15:36.673
You broke into tears the moment the song started up.

15:36.953 --> 15:40.495
Sorry for making you cry right away!

15:40.595 --> 15:43.016
I understand.

15:43.096 --> 15:44.696
BAU BAU!

15:44.756 --> 15:45.577
BAU BAU!

15:45.657 --> 15:47.217
Thank you!

15:47.718 --> 15:48.618
Thank you!

15:49.098 --> 15:50.059
Please check it out too!

15:50.119 --> 15:54.320
I think you know FUWAMOCO, we might have lots of fun coming up too.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.261
Yeah!

15:55.781 --> 15:58.622
Maybe we can reveal our breaking dimensions all together.

15:58.722 --> 15:59.663
All together!

15:59.783 --> 16:00.783
And with secret stories.

16:02.907 --> 16:05.349
BAU BAU!

16:06.989 --> 16:09.471
Well, you know, we're in New York.

16:09.591 --> 16:24.139
And then, you know, just this weekend, right after Breaking Dimensions, we were all together with Abyssgard at Anime Impulse in California for a guest appearance.

16:24.399 --> 16:27.961
Look at us there!

16:27.981 --> 16:30.743
We had so so much fun!

16:32.123 --> 16:37.746
I'm just surprised too, you know, we didn't think that we'd get to see the Ruffians so soon after Breaking Dimension.

16:37.806 --> 16:38.226
Yeah.

16:38.687 --> 16:39.827
And we had so much fun.

16:39.907 --> 16:43.309
It was a bit of an early morning, you know.

16:43.829 --> 16:46.310
But we were able to spend so much time together.

16:46.390 --> 16:47.731
It was so much fun.

16:48.011 --> 16:50.833
It was a lot of cute and funny, you know, together.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.614
All together with Advent.

16:52.634 --> 16:54.775
We argued, debated.

16:54.795 --> 16:59.157
Together, not just with Advent, but with you two in the audience.

16:59.637 --> 17:01.558
FUWAMOCO Being able to see your face!

17:01.578 --> 17:02.299
Your voice!

17:18.842 --> 17:18.962
Yeah.

17:19.022 --> 17:19.222
Yeah.

17:19.262 --> 17:19.642
Yeah.

17:19.842 --> 17:20.263
Yeah.

17:20.483 --> 17:20.683
Yeah.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.730
Thank you, Ruffians!

17:39.770 --> 17:40.971
Thank you!

17:41.031 --> 17:45.412
We hope we can chat even more in the future with hololive Mii, okay?

17:45.452 --> 17:47.353
Just call us, okay?

17:48.073 --> 17:50.374
BAU BAU!

17:50.674 --> 17:51.575
BAU BAU!

17:51.615 --> 17:52.715
You are so cute.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.776
It's really just so much fun.

17:57.497 --> 18:02.178
I wish we could have been able to do like hololive Mii after breaking the mention there.

18:03.118 --> 18:03.379
Why?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.746
Why did we not do it?

18:06.786 --> 18:07.107
Yeah.

18:07.567 --> 18:08.107
Why?

18:08.787 --> 18:09.387
Yeah.

18:09.948 --> 18:10.748
FUWAMOCO is safe!

18:10.808 --> 18:11.968
FUWAMOCO every corner!

18:11.988 --> 18:12.829
Yeah!

18:12.889 --> 18:13.289
Please!

18:13.349 --> 18:14.109
Please!

18:14.189 --> 18:14.509
Please!

18:14.649 --> 18:15.650
BAU BAU!

18:15.770 --> 18:16.430
Yeah!

18:16.610 --> 18:19.451
We really wanna go everywhere and anywhere.

18:19.851 --> 18:23.133
Especially if it's close to you, Ruffians.

18:23.453 --> 18:25.854
We wanna go everywhere so we can't say everywhere.

18:26.134 --> 18:26.674
We wanna go!

18:26.694 --> 18:27.194
We wanna go!

18:27.214 --> 18:27.755
We wanna go!

18:27.835 --> 18:28.815
Follow with you.

18:32.213 --> 18:36.197
Thank you, Ruffians!

18:36.217 --> 18:37.619
BAU BAU!

18:37.719 --> 18:45.407
As you can kinda maybe tell, it's been a bit of a whirlwind of crazy excitement ever since Breaking Dimensions.

18:46.068 --> 18:58.810
But within everything going on, FUWAMOCO, we also released a brand new cover song of the ending theme from the TV anime, Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai.

18:59.111 --> 19:01.291
Love is Indivisible by Twins.

19:01.611 --> 19:05.412
And the song is... Honey Citron!

19:05.812 --> 19:07.212
BAU BAU!

19:07.252 --> 19:09.112
Did you listen?

19:09.172 --> 19:09.893
What'd you think?

19:10.073 --> 19:11.593
What'd you think of this?

19:12.333 --> 19:13.714
A bit, a bit different.

19:14.094 --> 19:17.336
Yeah, it's a bit different from our previous song coverings.

19:17.516 --> 19:22.960
Because this time, we're directly asked to sing it from the anime team!

19:23.721 --> 19:25.322
Official coverings!

19:25.502 --> 19:26.923
That doesn't happen!

19:26.983 --> 19:28.184
Isn't that so cool?

19:28.324 --> 19:29.945
Right!

19:30.425 --> 19:36.429
We're just really really happy because while Futaki was already in anime we were really looking forward to.

19:36.449 --> 19:39.891
And then to suddenly be asked to sing their song!

19:40.432 --> 19:40.672
Right!

19:40.912 --> 19:42.713
It's a really big step, you know?

19:42.733 --> 19:43.513
It's a big deal.

19:43.533 --> 19:43.613
Yeah.

19:43.893 --> 19:50.455
So you know, so we put all, everything, everything, all of our power into the recording of it.

19:50.515 --> 19:50.775
Yeah.

19:50.795 --> 19:54.076
It was like, our only anime song.

19:54.556 --> 19:56.877
It's not though, it's not.

19:56.997 --> 19:57.337
Yeah.

19:57.437 --> 20:01.299
But you know, at the very least, it's an official cover song.

20:01.339 --> 20:01.959
Yeah!

20:02.239 --> 20:02.619
Right?

20:02.699 --> 20:03.499
Official!

20:03.719 --> 20:05.160
Not quite our anime song.

20:06.062 --> 20:06.442
In our heart.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.625
In our heart, in our delusions, right?

20:10.125 --> 20:12.367
Yeah, it's a very very cute song.

20:12.407 --> 20:16.750
Especially, you know, if you like their last cover song, Let Me Be With You.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.592
I think you'll like Honeysuchan a lot too.

20:20.273 --> 20:21.314
Please have a listen.

20:21.734 --> 20:25.257
Also, the illustrations in the video, this illustration right here.

20:25.737 --> 20:30.841
It's illustrated by the original light novel illustrator, Arumiku-sensei!

20:30.861 --> 20:31.001
Right?

20:31.501 --> 20:34.403
It's a huge honor!

20:36.792 --> 20:37.892
Please check it out, okay?

20:37.912 --> 20:38.893
You can't miss it!

20:39.053 --> 20:40.874
Please listen to it lots, and also!

20:40.894 --> 20:44.055
Futakire, the anime, is still airing right now!

20:44.355 --> 20:46.896
You can check it out over on Crunchyroll!

20:47.316 --> 20:49.637
But it's a really interesting love comedy.

20:49.657 --> 20:53.018
Very drama, not really comedy.

20:53.098 --> 20:54.419
Yeah, between twins.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.140
A bit of a love triangle.

20:57.580 --> 21:01.902
So, Ruffians, maybe if you could... I don't know why it's called a comedy.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.023
It's a bit of a love triangle.

21:05.283 --> 21:11.547
If you're curious, maybe what that would be like or maybe what kind of disaster that would be like.

21:12.448 --> 21:14.409
You'll need to check it out, okay?

21:17.311 --> 21:19.712
BAU BAU!

21:20.093 --> 21:21.073
It's a dramedy.

21:21.093 --> 21:24.355
I don't even know about that.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.737
I don't know who called it a comedy.

21:28.062 --> 21:29.963
I think their idea of comedy is different.

21:30.604 --> 21:30.904
Yeah.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.826
There's a lot of silly things going on, that's for sure.

21:33.846 --> 21:33.986
Yeah.

21:34.526 --> 21:35.387
Please check it out, Wolfie!

21:35.427 --> 21:35.967

21:57.522 --> 22:03.266
There's an event going on called ENigmatic Recollection!

22:03.946 --> 22:05.808
Have you been watching Ruffians?

22:05.888 --> 22:07.389
Yeah, have you seen it?

22:08.109 --> 22:14.633
Right now it's in process of a big special brand-wide event, an original content project.

22:15.654 --> 22:20.477
And in it, all of us hololive English members, we are the main characters!

22:23.065 --> 22:24.866
We've sort of lost our memories, huh?

22:24.886 --> 22:26.266
Sort of lost our memories.

22:26.767 --> 22:30.208
The world is the kingdom of lobestos.

22:30.388 --> 22:32.909
And there, the lobestians live!

22:33.630 --> 22:37.491
And you know the world is kind of plagued with stains.

22:37.551 --> 22:38.292
Calamity.

22:38.372 --> 22:39.432
Calamity.

22:40.152 --> 22:45.955
But it's okay because we, all of hololive English, we are there as heroes!

22:46.215 --> 22:48.436
And we'll unlock our memories again!

22:48.496 --> 22:50.417
And we'll save all of lobestos!

22:50.837 --> 22:52.860
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

23:11.398 --> 23:15.323
Things are getting more and more crazy with everyday eating hot pot.

23:15.783 --> 23:19.047
And we'll do our best, especially with our labestin cloaks.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.431
Very, very special hero cloaks.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.448
But also for En Record!

23:26.089 --> 23:29.371
We're also on the special Watch Party Show!

23:29.632 --> 23:33.775
Did you watch all fans?

23:33.795 --> 23:34.515
Yeah!

23:34.956 --> 23:45.484
We were there this time not singing, but kind of sharing some really exciting information and playing games together with our senpai for the very first time!

23:45.504 --> 23:49.267
Kronii-senpai, Ai-senpai, Ina-senpai, and Kiara-senpai!

23:50.646 --> 23:52.327
Do you forgive her yet, Moco-chan?

23:52.347 --> 23:53.769
I forgive her.

23:53.789 --> 23:55.430
Why don't you forget?

23:57.392 --> 23:57.952
Don't forget.

24:00.153 --> 24:07.636
Please check it out, there's a lot of funny moments, especially, you know, where you're kinda like, I still don't quite get what Unreckle is.

24:07.656 --> 24:11.058
It will probably help you get up to speed a little bit.

24:11.098 --> 24:12.378
You know?

24:12.958 --> 24:22.222
And, well, maybe it's a little bit of spoilers, but FUWAMOCO, we have been sorted into your G-Zord, you know?

24:22.342 --> 24:27.104
FUWAMOCO, I guess you know they're like, FUWAMOCO, you have courage, you have grit.

24:28.245 --> 24:28.605
Sure.

24:28.965 --> 24:29.185
Yeah.

24:29.943 --> 24:37.548
And that's where we are together with mysterious Calli, Elizabeth, and John Watson.

24:38.588 --> 24:39.549
Ami-senpai.

24:40.289 --> 24:41.250
Not John Watson.

24:42.050 --> 24:48.594
And also right now you can also check out the official ENigmatic Recollection!

24:51.295 --> 24:51.895
Enreko!

24:52.156 --> 24:52.856
Enreko!

24:52.916 --> 24:54.737
We call it Enreko for a reason.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.518
The official theme song.

24:57.818 --> 24:58.819
Start again.

24:58.919 --> 25:04.441
Sung by Ai-senpai, Kaori-senpai, Nerissa, and Elizabeth.

25:04.481 --> 25:06.662
It's very... What's the word?

25:07.603 --> 25:09.804
It's very hype, but it's sort of different, huh?

25:09.844 --> 25:10.164
Right?

25:10.224 --> 25:11.304
It's sort of different.

25:11.384 --> 25:12.745
It makes you sort of want to bounce.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.806
Bounce and stomp.

25:15.086 --> 25:15.366
Stomp.

25:15.406 --> 25:17.027
March maybe a little bit.

25:18.505 --> 25:23.246
Am I the only one who wants to bounce and stomp?

25:23.306 --> 25:25.807
Right!

25:26.187 --> 25:29.627
Right, and it's animated as well!

25:29.767 --> 25:31.968
Please go take a look at it!

25:32.468 --> 25:41.590
Also, maybe if you go take a peek at the official hololive store, you'll also notice that there's some very exciting anime merch there too!

25:42.510 --> 25:49.795
You know, if you want to remember this project forever and ever, please go and check it out there on the official hololive show!

25:50.035 --> 25:54.598
Now this is only chapter one, because Enryku is a long-term project.

25:54.838 --> 25:56.179
A long-term project, yeah.

25:56.219 --> 26:00.742
So it'll be going this entire week, the very first week of September here.

26:01.083 --> 26:08.067
So we hope that you'll join us all, all of hololive English, as we continue on our journey in the kingdom of Robusto.

26:09.288 --> 26:11.189
Thank you, Ruffians!

26:11.409 --> 26:12.989
Have you been enjoying it so far?

26:13.069 --> 26:15.050
What do you think?

26:16.470 --> 26:19.431
Oh, you want your own cape?

26:19.751 --> 26:21.812
That's only for heroes, Ruffians.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.453
You want your own cape, bitch?

26:24.713 --> 26:27.074
Are you saying you're not heroes?

26:28.334 --> 26:29.034
Lottery!

26:29.114 --> 26:30.335
Lottery!

26:30.455 --> 26:32.095
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:32.916 --> 26:33.756
It's not a lottery.

26:33.796 --> 26:35.396
You can get the merch without a lottery.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.577
Yeah, not lottery.

26:36.617 --> 26:36.937
Yeah.

26:38.183 --> 26:42.126
hololive means there's a little bit of a lot of it, but... Yeah.

26:42.746 --> 26:43.687
Please go check it out!

26:44.427 --> 26:45.168
Ruffians!

26:45.688 --> 26:47.589
BAU BAU!

26:47.609 --> 26:52.112
Well, you know... A new week is here!

26:52.172 --> 26:53.893
A new month is here!

26:54.013 --> 26:57.616
And well, there's a lot of things going on, Moco-chan.

26:58.156 --> 26:59.937
Ruffians, are you feeling okay?

26:59.977 --> 27:01.658
Are you ready for it?

27:02.479 --> 27:05.321
I don't know if the Ruffians are ready.

27:06.121 --> 27:07.362
Oh no, the new month just started.

27:10.304 --> 27:12.325
Ruffians!

27:12.906 --> 27:15.888
It's that time of the week again!

27:30.773 --> 27:31.353
It's time!

27:32.054 --> 27:32.334
Yes!

27:33.094 --> 27:34.255
You know what time it is!

27:35.715 --> 27:38.997
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

27:39.577 --> 27:41.938
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

27:42.298 --> 27:42.679
Mococo!

27:42.739 --> 27:43.479
Ruffians.

27:47.341 --> 27:47.861
Ruffians!

27:49.102 --> 27:50.002
It's a new month!

27:50.822 --> 27:51.863
A new start!

27:52.943 --> 27:55.184
Did you do your best to enjoy the end of summer?

27:56.185 --> 27:58.026
Altered match potential high!

27:59.373 --> 28:04.243
I know, it can be scary having another change, a big new start to your year!

28:04.263 --> 28:09.575
But, sooner than later, it'll feel like your regular everyday once again.

28:11.115 --> 28:18.740
Do your best, but sometimes you need to know that no matter how hard you work, that things won't go your way.

28:19.441 --> 28:20.241
And that's okay.

28:20.982 --> 28:31.368
You know, even if you put 200% in, it shouldn't be just to get a certain result, but to also enjoy the journey together along the way there, okay?

28:32.049 --> 28:37.412
You know, that way, if you don't get the result you wanted, then it's not a huge disappointment, okay?

28:38.253 --> 28:43.717
Because it's just natural that sometimes things won't go as you hope or as you expect.

28:44.658 --> 28:45.278
And that's okay!

28:45.298 --> 28:46.579
Got it!

28:49.862 --> 28:52.284
Let's continue to do our best no matter the result.

28:52.964 --> 28:56.246
And don't forget to have fun along the way, okay?

28:56.287 --> 28:56.807
Ganbatte de!

28:57.527 --> 28:58.088
BAU BAU!

28:58.128 --> 28:58.828
BAU BAU!

29:05.594 --> 29:08.416
Ruffians, are you ready to go?

29:08.836 --> 29:10.317
Don't be scared, okay?

29:10.357 --> 29:11.198
You can do it!

29:11.538 --> 29:15.302
Even if things don't quite work out as you expect them to do.

29:15.342 --> 29:15.702
BAU BAU!

29:15.982 --> 29:20.206
It's been a little while!

29:20.226 --> 29:20.586
Let's see!

29:23.248 --> 29:25.249
What the Doggie of the Day is today?

29:25.269 --> 29:30.273
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

29:30.433 --> 29:33.275
It's Kona and Nao!

29:33.315 --> 29:35.156
Just like us, you know.

29:35.176 --> 29:38.138
Just a little different blue and red, right?

29:38.238 --> 29:41.720
Look at them, they're so fluffy.

29:41.740 --> 29:45.043
I don't know, much fuzzier maybe.

29:45.083 --> 29:48.905
But Kona looks a little concerned right now.

29:50.466 --> 29:52.848
What's Noa up to something, huh?

29:53.349 --> 29:57.752
Maybe, maybe some teasing!

29:57.812 --> 30:01.536
Teasing fun.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.342
Let's give Noa the head pass, huh?

30:09.863 --> 30:10.443
MMC.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.866
Just how Kona bows bows.

30:14.627 --> 30:15.687
On the topic!

30:15.768 --> 30:18.170
How do they bow bow, Moco-chan?

30:21.071 --> 30:22.191
BAU BAU.

30:22.591 --> 30:23.192
BAU BAU.

30:23.212 --> 30:23.912
BAU BAU.

30:23.992 --> 30:24.452
BAU BAU.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.260
They look pretty identical.

30:49.501 --> 30:51.142
The faces look like they did something.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.123
You didn't notice the difference?

30:52.724 --> 30:54.045
I think Noah's up to something.

30:54.085 --> 30:55.946
Check your ears, okay?

30:56.687 --> 31:02.512
Well, you know, I can tell Kona and Nao are best buddies that go everywhere together.

31:03.093 --> 31:03.433
Noah.

31:03.754 --> 31:04.254
Nao.

31:05.615 --> 31:06.356
Nao.

31:06.876 --> 31:07.937
Nao.

31:07.997 --> 31:09.319
Yeah.

31:09.579 --> 31:12.842
Maybe they get into trouble and argue sometimes, but

31:13.942 --> 31:15.303
I can tell it doesn't last long.

31:15.383 --> 31:17.104
Kind of like us, right?

31:17.165 --> 31:18.125
Yeah.

31:18.786 --> 31:24.670
They're really good puppies and they're always happy to go for a walk together by your side.

31:25.371 --> 31:26.011
I know I am.

31:26.432 --> 31:29.494
Walks are always good.

31:30.255 --> 31:31.095
BAU BAU!

31:31.115 --> 31:34.418
Thank you for the endless BAU BAU!

31:39.093 --> 31:40.734
Have you been going on walks, Ruffians?

31:41.355 --> 31:42.736
We went on a walk!

31:42.756 --> 31:44.057
I am Central Park.

31:44.077 --> 31:45.978
I don't have a penis.

31:46.859 --> 31:49.501
Hold on, I know I get to go on a walk.

31:50.722 --> 31:51.102
Right.

31:52.423 --> 31:55.845
Well, let's see what you went on a walk with me, Ruffians!

31:55.925 --> 32:01.830
For today's I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

32:01.890 --> 32:05.172
Woah, woah, woah, what is this?

32:07.945 --> 32:08.685
A river?

32:09.106 --> 32:10.446
It's amazing!

32:10.506 --> 32:11.126
Right!

32:11.146 --> 32:15.588
It kind of looks like... Hollow Summoner!

32:16.009 --> 32:16.489
Right!

32:17.089 --> 32:18.049
Night pool!

32:18.089 --> 32:19.270
So fancy!

32:19.490 --> 32:21.491
I don't think it's a night pool.

32:21.511 --> 32:21.551
No.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.532
It's just a nice colorful river, right?

32:24.952 --> 32:28.314
It sort of looks like you could have a... ...adventure.

32:31.195 --> 32:32.096
I don't know.

32:32.476 --> 32:33.396
Is that just me?

32:33.476 --> 32:34.577
It's like an adventure.

32:34.757 --> 32:35.677
Yeah!

32:35.737 --> 32:36.217
Yeah!

32:36.237 --> 32:36.598
Yeah!

32:36.658 --> 32:37.038
Right!

32:38.235 --> 32:39.596
That's what I was thinking.

32:40.196 --> 32:40.676
I don't know.

32:40.796 --> 32:47.359
I don't think we're gonna see Marin-senpai and Jo-senpai come out of there in 4K all of a sudden.

32:48.059 --> 32:48.399
No.

32:48.739 --> 32:48.979
No?

32:49.080 --> 32:55.322
It's just, you know, something beautiful to look at at the end of your day, you know?

32:55.342 --> 32:57.143
At the end of the summer time, maybe?

32:57.203 --> 32:57.483
Yeah!

32:57.963 --> 33:02.005
Enjoy it while going on maybe your last summer night still alive.

33:02.025 --> 33:02.105
Yeah.

33:04.106 --> 33:05.930
BAU BAU!

33:05.990 --> 33:08.376
Welcome to FUWAMOCO!

33:14.443 --> 33:16.285
BAU BAU!

33:16.305 --> 33:22.771
For our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

33:23.031 --> 33:24.032
Good day, FUWAMOCO!

33:24.092 --> 33:24.893
Good day!

33:25.453 --> 33:33.320
In Born to be Bound, there's a part where Mococo got silly and changed the song differently than what it was originally.

33:33.741 --> 33:36.783
What was supposed to be in that part of your song?

33:39.995 --> 33:41.256
Team Ruffians!

33:41.736 --> 33:49.782
We both decided, you know, we're gonna sing a very cute, idly, very FUWAMOCO song, right?

33:50.382 --> 33:51.023
Right, you know?

33:51.463 --> 33:55.386
Maybe we're BAU BAU here, we're FUWAFUWA there, and MOCOMOCO there.

33:55.406 --> 33:55.846
But then!

33:55.866 --> 33:58.248
Moco-chan here had different plans.

34:05.301 --> 34:07.882
Had to throw in a heck time, huh?

34:09.262 --> 34:11.543
What's the deal, huh, Moco-chan?

34:12.403 --> 34:14.424
Ruffians!

34:15.544 --> 34:16.624
You love it, right?

34:17.545 --> 34:18.605
Heck time!

34:19.325 --> 34:24.087
Heck yeah!

34:25.207 --> 34:26.788
I guess, Ruffians.

34:27.468 --> 34:34.690
If you like it, then it's good, but... I don't want anyone thinking that we're naughty puppies.

34:37.043 --> 34:37.683
Heck yeah!

34:38.284 --> 34:39.064
Heck yeah!

34:39.184 --> 34:41.385
We're good demon guard dogs, right?

34:41.526 --> 34:42.806
Heck yeah!

34:44.687 --> 34:47.209
BAU BAU!

34:47.789 --> 34:48.950
Thank you so much!

34:49.030 --> 34:51.051
Thank you for all your submissions!

34:51.111 --> 34:55.173
You are an important part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:55.233 --> 34:55.894
We need you!

34:56.574 --> 34:59.876
So please, send us your demon guard dogs.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.577
Oh my gosh, that's us.

35:02.077 --> 35:03.578
Actually, the Ruffians already do that.

35:04.420 --> 35:04.720
Huh?

35:05.241 --> 35:09.223
You send us screenshots all the time of certain pair of demon-glide dogs.

35:10.384 --> 35:10.804
What?!

35:10.924 --> 35:13.506
Please send us your dogs of the day!

35:13.686 --> 35:15.407
Not your demon-glide dogs!

35:16.728 --> 35:18.689
Please send us your Pero sightings.

35:18.889 --> 35:20.550
Any questions you have!

35:21.090 --> 35:22.771
As loves, please send us the walks.

35:22.851 --> 35:26.434
I wanna know the nice beautiful autumn walks you're gonna be going on.

35:28.019 --> 35:29.221
Please use the hashtag.

35:29.241 --> 35:31.523
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

35:31.684 --> 35:35.949
Okay, we're waiting, Ruffians!

35:36.490 --> 35:38.152
BAU BAU!

35:38.172 --> 35:44.160
And for our next stream, we have... De-den!

35:44.240 --> 35:44.420
Day 5.

35:46.142 --> 35:49.123
Have an exciting recollection!

35:49.984 --> 35:51.324
And recoll!

35:51.344 --> 35:53.245
There's been a lot going on everyday.

35:53.265 --> 35:57.487
It just seems to heat up more, and new dungeons, new memories discovered.

35:57.587 --> 35:58.447
It troubles.

35:58.507 --> 36:04.390
You never know what's gonna happen in the kingdom of Lobasto, so please join us, okay?

36:04.730 --> 36:07.031
BAU BAU!

36:07.291 --> 36:09.572
And let's take a peek at our schedule this week.

36:10.665 --> 36:12.786
There's a lot of N-Reco going on.

36:13.167 --> 36:13.447
But!

36:14.167 --> 36:17.670
You know, we have the final on Saturday.

36:17.790 --> 36:18.050
Day 8.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.371
The final day of N-Reco.

36:20.471 --> 36:20.671
Yeah!

36:21.032 --> 36:24.614
And then on Sunday we're gonna be watching Day 1 and Day 2.

36:24.714 --> 36:26.815
Both days of Breaking Dimensions.

36:27.316 --> 36:33.240
So Ruffians, if you haven't got your streaming tickets, please get your paws on them and then we can watch it all together!

36:33.360 --> 36:33.920
Okay!

36:34.760 --> 36:37.923
Don't worry if you haven't been able to catch up with the archives for N-Reco 2.

36:37.963 --> 36:38.243
Yeah.

36:38.263 --> 36:38.343
Okay!

36:38.363 --> 36:38.923
Just watch!

36:40.344 --> 36:41.425
Watch them when you can.

36:41.945 --> 36:43.106
When you want to, okay?

36:43.126 --> 36:45.127
There's a lot going on.

36:45.307 --> 36:45.667
A lot.

36:46.908 --> 36:49.009
Thank you, Ruffians!

36:49.109 --> 36:55.073
And for Ruffians who are joining us today through the archives, here is your FUWAMOCO word!

36:55.793 --> 36:58.615
It's BAU BAU BUSY BAU BAUS!

36:58.855 --> 37:01.877
BAU BAU!

37:01.937 --> 37:02.497
BAU BAU!

37:03.389 --> 37:08.752
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:08.812 --> 37:10.473
Especially after a little break.

37:10.633 --> 37:11.753
Thank you!

37:12.413 --> 37:19.157
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

37:19.577 --> 37:20.257
MEN MEN!

37:20.658 --> 37:21.178
BAU BAU!

37:21.938 --> 37:23.380
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:38.112 --> 37:45.134
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

37:45.154 --> 37:48.815
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

38:07.859 --> 38:08.040
Bye-bye!
