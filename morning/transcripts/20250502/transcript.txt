[05:34.78]Thank you for joining us today for our 150 second episode!
[05:41.35]Are you awake?
[05:41.75]You're awake.
[05:42.49]It keeps on getting a bigger number and every time I have to think, how do I say this again?
[05:51.46]It's just gonna keep on getting harder from here on out.
[05:54.75]You're awake cause of the glasses.
[05:57.19]BAU BAU!
[06:02.01]Good morning!
[06:03.17]You know, happy Friday, right before a very fun weekend.
[06:10.60]But Ruffians, you know, maybe it's a little bit hard getting out of bed, so we're here to help you with that!
[06:20.94]But for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today,
[06:24.42]FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.
[06:30.57]A.K.A.
[06:32.41]FUWAMOCO!
[06:32.83]And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!
[06:36.34]Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.
[06:41.57]Now, you know the drill, right?
[06:43.73]Please tweet and dodge the hashtag!
[06:46.69]Hashtag FWMCMORNING!
[06:49.44]Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!
[06:53.64]BAU BAU!
[06:57.49]Thank you, Ruffians!
[06:59.23]I've seen Ruffians hashtag #on Twitter.
[07:01.98]I saw that too.
[07:03.04]I was a bit confused.
[07:05.42]Why?
[07:05.84]Like, oh, did you make a mistake?
[07:08.57]She doesn't really like it that much.
[07:10.65]That's okay though, because I do.
[07:12.94]I don't like it!
[07:16.32]I like it so much!
[07:20.23]BAU BAU!
[07:20.41]Thank you, Abyss!
[07:20.95]Game for short for morning shows!
[07:23.34]Yes!
[07:24.20]Short for my Moco-chan!
[07:25.68]Very, very short.
[07:26.78]That means under half an hour.
[07:29.15]Not an hour.
[07:30.54]Very short.
[07:31.62]Yes, very short.
[07:32.72]Let's get things moving, Moco-chan!
[07:35.31]Okay, okay!
[07:35.67]Exciting news!
[07:36.71]Exciting news!
[07:37.41]Yeah!
[07:38.45]Exciting.
[07:39.31]You know.
[07:40.01]No, no.
[07:42.43]Nasty.
[07:42.58]No, I need exciting news.
[07:49.30]Go-chan, why are you making that sound, huh?
[07:57.74]Go-chan.
[07:58.14]Wow.
[08:01.13]Another Pero sighting!
[08:12.57]It's good to know where Pero is, so that, you know, we can be careful.
[08:18.98]It happened again, Ruffians.
[08:21.32]Yeah.
[08:21.44]Well, let's take a look at the Pero machine this time.
[08:25.84]Let's take a look.
[08:32.27]This is where Pero has been, huh?
[08:35.07]He's been sitting on this poor Ruffian's porch in a box at your front door.
[08:42.10]I don't know, that's a little pitiful, right Moco-chan?
[08:46.02]Besides too, look!
[08:47.62]Look, he probably used those wings as much as he could to write those letters!
[08:53.57]Really desperate, huh?
[08:54.33]Leave the Ruffian alone, ya!
[08:56.93]I don't know.
[08:59.23]What should we do?
[09:01.83]Adopt!
[09:02.69]Adopt!
[09:04.00]You want him?
[09:05.00]Wow, that's kind of embarrassing.
[09:07.66]That's some strong wording.
[09:09.90]He's holding a knife!
[09:12.25]It's good to always think those things, you know?
[09:14.55]I don't see anything, but don't know what's underneath.
[09:16.81]He can't even write E properly!
[09:20.96]Yeah... But that also looks sort of funny, huh?
[09:25.81]I don't know, Moco-chan.
[09:27.66]I feel like maybe in this situation, you let him in.
[09:34.39]Give him a pass away!
[09:37.05]Right!
[09:38.15]I mean, it's a requirement of finding anything lonely in a cardboard box, right?
[09:43.72]You give it a bath?
[09:45.84]Right!
[09:47.18]Huh?
[09:48.06]No.
[09:49.15]No.
[09:50.27]Give a bath for him?
[09:51.69]Return the sander.
[09:54.37]Put the sunglasses on.
[09:55.89]Close up the sides.
[09:58.18]All the tape, packing tape.
[10:01.84]Might as well give him a home.
[10:05.35]Even wash him?
[10:06.91]I'm not gonna wash him, but maybe Ruffians.
[10:09.74]You could and then you know.
[10:12.84]Not bad.
[10:13.64]Wet demon dog smell.
[10:16.51]Go away?
[10:18.97]Maybe.
[10:19.41]Yeah.
[10:19.53]You're the dog Pero?
[10:20.85]Okay.
[10:21.45]Go play.
[10:22.55]But be careful, okay?
[10:25.73]BAU BAU!
[10:48.14]But forget that though!
[10:50.53]Today is a special day!
[10:53.33]Because today is hololive English -Advent-'s 1,000th Shiori Nobel's birthday!
[11:05.15]Happy birthday Shiori!
[11:06.51]I didn't forget, right?
[11:08.03]Very happy birthday Shiori!
[11:11.50]I can't believe it's Shiori's second birthday already.
[11:15.16]I can't believe it.
[11:16.39]But a big, big happy birthday to our lovely Chame!
[11:21.05]And this year, this year, Shiori, she's celebrating it with a tea party!
[11:26.46]Yeah!
[11:27.26]Maybe!
[11:28.80]It's a little mystery, huh?
[11:30.29]Yeah, but you know, she's gonna be celebrating it starting at 7pm PT today!
[11:37.40]And you're invited, Ruffians!
[11:39.64]Is that a team song?
[11:42.28]Chainsaw?
[11:44.59]I don't know what you're talking about.
[11:45.91]What do you mean a chainsaw?
[11:46.51]It's a tea party.
[11:47.57]You bring a chainsaw to a tea party?
[11:52.50]Why?
[11:55.65]To cut the cake?
[11:58.40]Maybe.
[12:00.00]Well, you know what?
[12:01.66]You'll find out if you join her.
[12:04.41]And you know what?
[12:04.97]Use the hashtag!
[12:06.99]Hashtag!
[12:08.13]Party Bella 2025!
[12:09.24]Yes!
[12:10.98]Ruffians, you're good at the hashtag, right?
[12:13.50]Right!
[12:14.79]But you know what, Shiori looks like she's gonna have a bunch of fun there.
[12:19.69]I never really know what's gonna happen.
[12:21.60]Especially the party with Shiori.
[12:25.68]You know, it'll definitely be wild for sure, you know.
[12:29.29]Yeah, mini cheese sofa cake cutting.
[12:31.25]Well, it's up to Shiori, right?
[12:34.68]Yeah, it is her party, you know.
[12:35.94]I gave Shiori a present.
[12:36.90]Not yet.
[12:38.24]Wait, how do I give a Shiori a gift?
[12:45.61]That doesn't count.
[12:47.30]No.
[12:48.26]I'm not saying that counts.
[12:51.21]But please, please go and say happy birthday to Shiori okay?
[12:58.85]BAU BAU!
[12:59.11]Happy birthday Shiori!
[13:03.21]Exciting time.
[13:04.72]I know, so many things going on.
[13:07.10]But one thing we're especially surprised and excited for is...
[13:13.89]Ayame-senpai!
[13:16.76]I'm not kidding!
[13:18.20]Ayame-senpai!
[13:20.54]I'm not kidding!
[13:22.85]Ayame-senpai!
[13:23.53]Ayame-senpai!
[13:24.31]Ayame-senpai!
[13:27.77]Ayame-senpai!
[13:28.58]Ayame-senpai!
[13:28.90]Ayame-senpai!
[13:29.18]Ayame-senpai!
[13:29.46]Ayame-senpai!
[13:30.16]Ayame-senpai!
[13:30.48]Ayame-senpai!
[13:31.04]Ayame-senpai!
[13:32.14]Ayame-senpai!
[13:33.46]Ayame-senpai!
[13:33.82]Ayame-senpai!
[13:35.17]Ayame-senpai!
[13:35.53]Ayame-senpai!
[13:35.87]Ayame-senpai!
[13:36.15]Ayame-senpai!
[13:36.69]Ayame-senpai!
[13:36.97]Ayame-senpai!
[13:37.65]Ayame-senpai!
[13:37.93]Ayame-senpai!
[13:38.23]Ayame-senpai!
[13:38.57]Ayame-senpai!
[13:38.93]Ayame-senpai!
[13:39.25]Ayame-senpai!
[13:39.63]Ayame-senpai!
[13:39.91]Ayame-senpai!
[13:40.19]Ayame-senpai!
[13:40.51]Ayame-senpai!
[13:40.79]Ayame-senpai!
[13:41.13]Ayame-senpai!
[13:41.41]Ayame-senpai!
[13:41.70]Ayame-sen
[13:42.62]Ruffians you have to know about it too!
[13:55.00]It's still coming up just a bit.
[13:58.33]May 4th at 4am PT.
[14:00.15]So you know, maybe I'll just wake up one morning and Ayame-senpai will look extra extra cute.
[14:08.79]We'll have to see what we're looking forward to!
[14:11.68]BAU BAU!
[14:14.11]Can Ayame-senpai get any cuter?
[14:17.51]Uh-oh.
[14:18.98]Uh-oh.
[14:21.40]Uh-oh.
[14:37.41]FUWAMOCO!
[14:43.14]We opened its doors!
[14:46.73]It seems to have a few troubles of its own!
[14:53.24]Ah, you know, Cafe FUWAMOCO's bad.
[14:58.32]Yes!
[14:58.64]You know, last time, there was a few customers that came to be able to, you know, take up the brand new cafe with the newbie maids.
[15:07.87]The fluffy, the one inside is a fluffy, fluffy moch.
[15:11.54]A strange cafe, no?
[15:12.80]Yeah, the one inside is a fuzzy, Mococo.
[15:17.34]Very normal.
[15:17.72]Yeah.
[15:17.84]Yeah.
[15:18.64]But, well,
[15:19.02]You know, apparently things didn't go so smoothly the very first time.
[15:24.54]It took a little while to come back for another day to open the shop up.
[15:30.55]I mean the first day of business they forgot to bill everyone.
[15:34.02]And now, it seems like it's hard to build people as well, huh?
[15:39.63]Yeah, I know.
[15:41.00]And despite it being a holiday vacation, and having the sign turned on, it looks like the cafe might go bankrupt.
[15:52.35]Yeah.
[15:52.99]But there's two very, very wonderful Masters that came.
[15:58.76]Mingo Shuji-sama and Watame Go Shuji-sama.
[16:02.81]But there's also an order, an order from BAU Eats too.
[16:08.93]But...
[16:10.86]I love the time the two maids were seen twiddling their thumbs and sitting down waiting in the cafe.
[16:19.33]They know all the new improvements.
[16:23.04]Maybe didn't make much of a difference in the survival of the cafe, huh?
[16:30.13]We don't believe in the cafe.
[16:31.60]You believe that the cafe will survive.
[16:33.54]We'll have to see.
[16:36.44]We'll have to see.
[16:37.74]No, it's not so easy to run a cafe like cafe FUWAMOCO, maybe.
[16:46.01]But one thing's for sure.
[16:48.14]It's very cute and a little different.
[16:51.22]Maybe they need to change, huh?
[16:54.46]Maybe it's not with the times.
[16:56.59]Maybe this cafe is just not fit.
[17:00.63]BAU BAU!
[17:06.70]Please check out my FUWAMOCO!
[17:14.59]BAU BAU!
[17:20.62]BAU BAU!
[17:22.07]Ruffians, we announced something that we are super happy to share with you!
[17:29.08]Finally!
[17:29.26]A few months ago back in October last year, we hit a big big milestone of 1 million subscribers on YouTube!
[17:37.96]And so we wanted to celebrate it together with you.
[17:41.52]And to commemorate it, we released FUWAMOCO, our 1 million subscriber celebration merch!
[17:50.56]You know, this merch is very very special because it's something that, you know, FUWAMOCO, we thought of.
[17:58.43]We wanted to celebrate it together with you this way.
[18:01.87]We organized it all we saw.
[18:04.19]A lot came from our ideas, you know.
[18:07.28]Like, I want it like this, and I'll have this.
[18:09.48]This would be good to go around thinking, ah, what about this?
[18:13.28]Why don't we do this?
[18:14.69]What do the Ruffians do?
[18:15.77]You know, go to the store, take photos and stuff.
[18:18.77]We put a lot of love and consideration into it.
[18:22.80]It's not like other merch, you know.
[18:25.70]You know, this is from us, Chikyuu Ruffians!
[18:31.37]We're really happy to share it.
[18:33.51]There's a bunch of really cool things in it.
[18:36.73]Can you take a look?
[18:38.78]We have a super cute illustration here from Icomochi-mama!
[18:44.12]I think it looks really cute, but...
[19:11.39]And you can also get a very special milestone voice too!
[19:17.36]You can only hear it there, but!
[19:20.06]In the set here, we have a very cute Dreams Come True acrylic diorama stand of both of us!
[19:27.05]Basically, the first diorama acrylic stand of the two of us!
[19:31.87]And not just us, you too, Ruffians!
[19:35.68]Pero too!
[19:38.02]It's very cute!
[19:39.46]Whole family, yeah!
[19:41.04]Everybody's there.
[19:43.52]And next we have a very, very special item.
[19:48.33]We have a pledge of loyalty.
[19:50.77]In certificate form here for you to open.
[19:53.47]Yes, you haven't forgotten, right?
[19:55.31]Our pledge from us to yours.
[19:58.04]Right!
[19:59.02]The same one that we made on the Daily Daily.
[20:03.66]But now you can have it in your own paws to display.
[20:08.41]Throw them before me every day.
[20:12.19]FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.
[20:21.94]Have a howl of a day!
[20:42.18]But, the thing is with these button badges, you can put them on.
[20:52.43]Together with FUWAMOCO Oshi-Bag!
[20:53.09]Our very first Oshi-Bag!
[20:54.05]We worked really hard on it!
[20:55.84]See, there's a lot of different Oshi-Bags out there.
[20:58.20]This is the first FUWAMOCO one, and this one we put a lot of thought into.
[21:02.93]See with this one, it's a big bag!
[21:05.31]Very practical, very...
[21:08.62]Functional.
[21:11.27]There's a black bag inside of it that can actually be removed.
[21:15.62]There's also a very nice FUWAMOCO inner lining there!
[21:19.75]So you can put in between the black bag and then the plastic.
[21:23.62]What kind of plastic clear lining you can put your cam badges in there.
[21:28.45]You can put plushies, headlights, figures, anything you want to, you know, make a bit of a statement.
[21:34.74]It can be casual, it can be more fun.
[21:38.01]There's lots of different ways to be able to show how proud a Ruffian you are.
[21:43.52]Depending on the situation, you know, if you want to go on your day-to-day or when you're going to a convention or a special event.
[21:51.99]We also have in the set a special voice pack!
[21:56.62]It's a system sound voice pack, you know, so you can use it in your daily life!
[22:02.30]Have you listened yet, Ruffians?
[22:04.61]And it's in English and Japanese too, so I think there's lots of different ways that you can use it.
[22:11.92]You can customize it even if you want to.
[22:14.52]If physical merch is difficult, there is this as well.
[22:17.90]It's digital.
[22:18.62]It's digital, you know.
[22:22.47]Yeah.
[22:22.59]The ringtone is super good.
[22:25.25]Yeah!
[22:25.37]FUWAMOCO!
[22:25.57]Are you having a good life?
[22:26.13]Thank you!
[22:26.75]But right now pre-orders are open until June 2nd.
[22:30.30]Yes!
[22:30.40]So we hope that maybe, maybe there could be a discussion with Wallet Club.
[22:35.60]And that you'll check it out.
[22:36.74]If you so feel like it.
[22:38.21]You can check it out.
[22:38.93]There's a link in the description over on the official hololive shop.
[22:42.69]So please check it out.
[22:44.35]In this description.

[22:49.50]Probably not.
[22:51.17]Moco-chan!
[22:52.39]I forgot to update it.

[23:51.86]There's going to be a very special 3D program for Enryku-chan, did you know?
[23:58.11]Enryku ENigmatic Recollection!
[24:00.34]This is such a cool thumbnail.
[24:02.66]Nerissa.
[24:05.07]Iina-senpai, Caroline-senpai, Korone-senpai, Biboo.
[24:08.51]What comes next?
[24:10.45]We'll connect all the chains of fate.
[24:13.20]There's a lot of mysteries, a lot of questions.
[24:16.26]And this was gonna happen in this 3D program.
[24:19.84]Apparently there's gonna be... Challenges?
[24:23.87]Challenges.
[24:24.31]I don't know the way they explained it sounded ominous.
[24:27.65]Challenges.
[24:28.93]Maybe challenges the challenge the chain of fate.
[24:33.74]Who knows?
[24:34.62]Well, for more FUWAMOCOs that are like, okay, what is this ENigmatic Recollection thing?
[24:40.45]Yes!
[24:40.55]Well, for sure N-RECORD!
[24:43.05]N-RECORD is a Minecraft roleplay!
[24:46.01]Advent that hololive English that we've been doing!
[24:50.22]Yeah, hololive English!
[24:51.28]It's the start of chapter 2!
[24:52.75]Yes!
[24:52.81]You know, we had a bunch of fun Chapter 1 all together with everybody.
[24:56.71]But just because you didn't catch Chapter 1 doesn't mean that you can't follow along for Chapter 2.
[25:02.09]Do not worry.
[25:02.48]You know, if you're curious also what did happen in Chapter 1, you can check out there's a bunch of little summary clip videos about the things that happened in Chapter 1.
[25:12.35]You know, I would say that that's just to be able to get more hype and record too.
[25:17.51]Now recap's right!
[25:19.81]But the main event will be starting on Saturday at 7pm PT!
[25:25.92]It's just right around the corner now!
[25:29.69]We hope that you're looking forward to it as much as us Ruffians!
[25:33.67]You'll be there for sure!
[25:36.98]BAU BAU!
[25:38.92]I can't wait.
[25:40.10]Corruption.

[25:43.83]BAU BAU!
[25:47.48]We're gonna take a look to see who's our Doggie of the Day today!
[25:57.76]Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Luna!
[26:05.53]Luna-mama!
[26:05.75]Such a sweetie!
[26:06.79]Look at that nose!
[26:08.56]The cheeks!
[26:10.28]This is too cute!
[26:13.14]Pupito guys too!
[26:15.25]Right!
[26:17.92]She's such a pretty color pattern too, right?
[26:23.03]Right!
[26:24.63]FUWAMOCO.
[26:25.31]Moc here.
[26:27.46]Moc here.
[26:28.17]How does Luna bow-bow?
[26:56.92]BAU BAU!
[27:07.28]BAU BAU!
[27:08.16]BAU BAU!
[27:09.02]BAU BAU!
[27:12.21]BAU BAU!
[27:14.47]You know, we can see from this beautiful photo, she's just such a big sweetie.
[27:19.74]I wanna grow up her cheeks.
[27:21.20]Right.
[27:21.86]You know, her cheeks are big.
[27:23.22]Her nose is big.
[27:24.94]But, I say deep down, there's also a very, very big heart too.
[27:32.13]And you know, I think Luna likes tweets.
[27:34.16]Tweets?
[27:34.62]Tweets?
[27:35.04]Tweets?
[27:36.00]Tweets a lot.
[27:37.66]But more than that, she loves you.
[27:40.90]Not Twitter.
[27:41.76]Not Twitter.
[27:42.71]No.
[27:43.48]She's not addicted to toilet, she's addicted to you!
[27:46.08]So you know, make sure you give her lots and lots of hand pats and belly rubs too.
[27:54.46]And that you play with her cheeks too, that's a request from me.
[27:57.26]Yeah, requested.
[28:00.79]BAU BAU!
[28:02.45]BAU BAU!
[28:02.63]Thank you!
[28:02.85]I love you, do you know that?
[28:05.75]It'll be a little bit warmer from spring to summer.
[28:10.56]Let's take a look at where you've been going for a walk.
[28:14.19]The day I went on a walk, we have... De-den!
[28:20.24]Oh, a ski park!
[28:22.48]Such a cool ski park.
[28:26.35]Yeah, and a city!
[28:29.81]And New York City!
[28:30.75]New York!
[28:31.80]Dun dun dun dun.
[28:33.72]I was gonna say, did you break any dimensions at the Skateboard Park?
[28:39.99]Yeah.
[28:41.05]Yeah?
[28:41.31]Ah, Dokonoko is in New York!
[28:44.43]But you know, hopefully you had a ton of fun.
[28:48.16]That's easily... Yeah.
[28:52.28]Heck yeah.
[28:52.96]You wanna heck yeah?
[28:55.21]HECK YEAH!
[29:01.38]BAU BAU!
[29:04.33]But it looks cool!
[29:06.43]It's very fast!
[29:09.68]BAU BAU!
[29:13.02]We also received a question from you ruffians on our Question of the Day.
[29:18.25]Let's take a look at the question we received.
[29:20.65]We have De-den!
[29:24.50]Hi FUWAMOCO!
[29:24.76]Hello!
[29:25.08]I have a question.
[29:25.90]Besides playing games, you also have a morning show, FUWAMOCO Morning, a maid cafe, and many other interesting things.
[29:34.25]Rock n' Rawr Party!
[29:36.15]I don't know Japanese, so I wanted to ask if you could do a Japanese lesson!
[29:41.30]This could be very helpful to me and maybe others too!
[29:47.27]BAU BAU!
[29:47.49]Such a good question!
[29:48.97]A long time ago.
[29:50.09]Yeah, back when we kinda debuted.
[29:53.32]We did do a Japanese classroom together with Advent.
[29:57.52]We did our best as teachers.
[29:59.28]It was a lot of fun, but our brains also felt like they were about to break.
[30:05.99]Yeah.
[30:06.36]You know, it's hard when there's like a lot of students, not just Abyss, but you too, Ruffians!
[30:12.59]Yeah, and we want to make sure you know that everyone's understanding, having fun.
[30:17.55]It's hard with lots of different skill levels, too.
[30:21.95]Yeah!
[30:22.35]But, you know, there's a lot of fun things about the Japanese language and maybe some areas that aren't as hard as you might think.
[30:28.82]Right!
[30:29.10]So, if we could do another classroom, maybe teach you a bit.
[30:32.64]And make us happy!
[30:33.89]I know!
[30:34.71]But, uh, I don't know how to do that one.
[30:36.35]But it has been discussed.
[30:39.13]Yes!
[30:40.81]You want us to teach math?
[30:45.54]No.
[30:46.08]Are you sure about that?
[30:47.10]No.
[30:48.74]Do you just see the glasses and think, I want to be taught?
[30:51.93]That's maybe it, huh?
[30:57.54]Is that more of it?
[30:59.46]Oh no, please do.
[31:00.52]Oh no, please do.
[31:03.20]You seem to be contradicting, Ruffians.
[31:05.67]Huh?
[31:06.60]I would really like to be able to teach you know, the Ruffians more.
[31:11.87]Advent more too, so... I don't know who the best teacher is though.
[31:15.64]Yeah, I don't know either, but... BAU BAU!
[31:22.26]Thank you!
[31:23.27]Thank you so much Ruffians for all your submissions!
[31:25.85]The hashtag!
[31:28.23]Hashtag FWMCMORNING!
[31:28.75]You know, sometimes it's kinda nasty to start the day off with a Pero sighting, but
[31:33.20]It's very important, so please let us know if you see Pero around.
[31:37.74]Even if it's maybe in a little bit of a weird place.
[31:40.39]You know, also... If you see a very cute doggy, this is a doggy of a day!
[31:47.28]You know, also, if you have any more questions or you go on a really nice walk, please share them with us with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!
[31:59.63]BAU BAU!
[31:59.81]Thank you!
[32:00.33]Ah, well, we have another stream coming up very soon!
[32:04.90]Very, very soon!
[32:08.71]Well... De-den!
[32:09.33]We're starting off our FUWAMOCO Mini-Hurricane Matsuri!
[32:14.50]Yes!
[32:14.60]It's such a fun game to do!
[32:16.88]And we'll be starting with night delivery to our game!
[32:20.15]It'll be at 9AM JST!
[32:22.75]Oh, you know, and we'll also be continuing from there.
[32:26.03]I'm on observation duty 1.
[32:28.84]There's a bunch of other games, you know.
[32:31.80]Maybe some Minecraft fishing in the middle.
[32:34.14]Back to it!
[32:36.89]But it'll be definitely very silly.
[32:38.89]Maybe spooky.
[32:40.61]Hopefully not too scary.
[32:41.83]And maybe a bit surprising too.
[32:44.58]And we'll be playing a bunch of them past midnight too.
[32:48.56]Extra spooky, right?
[32:51.97]Yeah, we hope you're ready for some mischief!
[32:55.08]It's gonna be lots of fun!
[32:57.26]Can't wait.
[32:58.28]We hope you're ready, Ruffians.
[33:02.15]Yeah, it's not howling.
[33:09.52]No.
[33:09.60]BAU BAU!
[33:09.78]And our schedule!
[33:11.96]Well, after our mini-horror game matsuri, and FUWAMOCO's just about to start,
[33:18.63]I'll be having a lot of fun adventures in Aramako.
[33:22.32]But in between there, we're also going to be continuing with Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2!
[33:28.23]We just started having a bunch of fun in the jungle being sneaky.
[33:33.05]Very sneaky.
[33:34.09]Very sneaky.
[33:36.12]We did not maybe run into a dog the other day in the forest, did we?
[33:42.14]Forget about Rufus, okay?
[33:43.63]Keep going.
[33:44.97]But we'll be having a lot more fun days here, Ruffians.
[33:48.16]So we hope you enjoy us.
[33:49.62]Enjoy us?
[33:50.44]Join us!
[33:51.24]For that as well.
[33:52.60]To have more fun.
[33:54.71]And enjoy time together.
