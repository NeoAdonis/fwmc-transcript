05:07.130 --> 05:09.430
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:09.910 --> 05:13.515
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.775 --> 05:17.416
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:17.476 --> 05:19.617
BAU BAU!

05:20.218 --> 05:23.559
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:23.799 --> 05:26.360
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:26.540 --> 05:29.341
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.381 --> 05:29.922
BAU BAU!

05:30.882 --> 05:35.224
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:36.524 --> 05:37.545
Morning, Ruffians!

05:38.045 --> 05:43.009
Thank you for waking up and joining us today for our 56th episode!

05:43.129 --> 05:46.911
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:46.931 --> 05:51.234
Oh, maybe Ruffians, is this your first time joining us today?

05:51.494 --> 05:51.954
Maybe not.

05:52.015 --> 05:52.715
Maybe not!

05:53.155 --> 05:54.156
But it is!

05:54.637 --> 06:02.123
Wow, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:02.783 --> 06:03.344
A.K.A.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.665
FUWAMOCO!

06:05.045 --> 06:08.288
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:08.308 --> 06:13.892
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:14.693 --> 06:17.055
I see some Ruffians saying it's their first time.

06:17.075 --> 06:18.176
Oh, oh, oh, oh?

06:19.757 --> 06:21.538
And I know it's not.

06:23.579 --> 06:28.362
Well, anyways, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:28.802 --> 06:31.744
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

06:32.124 --> 06:36.486
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:36.727 --> 06:40.429
BAU BAU!

06:40.529 --> 06:43.650
Well, Ruffians, are you awake?

06:43.770 --> 06:47.172
Why are you so fluffy and fuzzy?

06:49.445 --> 06:50.865
Are you still fuzzy in bed?

06:50.885 --> 06:52.466
Or sleepy?

06:52.506 --> 06:52.966
Wake up!

06:54.466 --> 06:58.667
It's time to wake up!

06:59.467 --> 07:01.508
I think one Ruffian spotted.

07:05.669 --> 07:06.289
Let's see.

07:07.609 --> 07:09.170
Let's see where he is this time.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.470
De-den!

07:19.847 --> 07:21.328
That's a very good snowman.

07:21.828 --> 07:23.669
The best one!

07:24.229 --> 07:25.130
It's so cute!

07:26.150 --> 07:28.952
Making a bad situation into something good.

07:29.092 --> 07:36.455
You know, we're glad you were able to save the snow day before Pero maybe turned it into a bit of a bad one.

07:36.795 --> 07:40.677
But you know, I think that's a textbook snowman right there.

07:40.697 --> 07:41.718
Yeah!

07:41.818 --> 07:42.298
Perfect.

07:42.438 --> 07:47.641
You know, aside from Pero being trapped in the lower body, but... Aside from that, yeah.

07:48.161 --> 07:50.624
But it looks good despite everything.

07:50.864 --> 07:51.825
It's good, just good.

07:51.845 --> 07:52.866
It looks perfect.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.827
Yes, perfect.

07:55.148 --> 07:57.070
No rocks, no leaves.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.932
Nice snow.

08:01.053 --> 08:03.696
But I guess Pero must be pretty weak.

08:06.178 --> 08:06.358
BAU BAU!

08:30.347 --> 08:36.831
Moco-chan, maybe we should remember that for the future.

08:37.492 --> 08:38.252
Could be handy!

08:41.485 --> 08:43.306
BAU BAU!

08:43.406 --> 08:44.586
Thank you for the handy tip.

08:44.666 --> 08:50.968
Actually now I'm looking at the snowman's nose and I'm starting to feel a little bit hungry.

08:51.708 --> 08:52.848
Looks pretty yummy, no?

08:53.528 --> 08:53.909
Carrot.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.449
Good breakfast snack.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.850
BAU BAU!

08:59.750 --> 09:02.091
Well, Ruffians!

09:03.797 --> 09:05.859
Something very happy happened!

09:06.339 --> 09:09.421
We can't really believe it, but Ruffians!

09:09.441 --> 09:13.704
Our cover of Cute no Kanojo has hit 500,000 views!

09:13.764 --> 09:17.587
BAU BAU!

09:17.707 --> 09:19.288
How did that happen?

09:19.308 --> 09:27.775
I feel like we were just celebrating the last laughing, but thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your support!

09:27.875 --> 09:31.397
Actually, we had something that we wanted to share with you.

09:32.950 --> 09:33.470
BAU BAU!

09:50.421 --> 09:50.961
We'll see.

09:52.422 --> 09:53.763
BAU BAU!

09:54.744 --> 09:58.146
And also speaking of 500,000 milestone, Bijou!

09:58.166 --> 10:06.812
hololive's shining gem Bijou Koseki Bijou has hit 500,000 subscribers on YouTube!

10:06.832 --> 10:07.372
500,000 pebbles!

10:14.757 --> 10:16.219
That's a lot of pebbles.

10:16.339 --> 10:17.981
Almost enough for a driveway.

10:20.264 --> 10:22.948
Congratulations, Biboo!

10:23.268 --> 10:23.528
Biboo!

10:24.029 --> 10:26.312
You know, she's such a hard worker.

10:26.372 --> 10:28.835
Silly and cute.

10:28.855 --> 10:30.157
We're very happy for her.

10:31.839 --> 10:38.627
We're happy that we're all so close and such a strong team all together with all of Advent.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.410
We can't wait to reach even more milestones together.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.973
Congratulations!

10:44.453 --> 10:46.196
BAU BAU!

10:50.612 --> 10:51.454
Congratulations.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.980
Topic of more Advent news.

11:07.561 --> 11:08.541
Nerissa.

11:09.362 --> 11:11.124
Nerissa!

11:11.264 --> 11:15.307
She just announced her newest song cover of S.O.S.

11:15.667 --> 11:19.431
from Idolmaster, Shiny Colors!

11:19.531 --> 11:22.113
Yeah, you know Ruffians, we actually have a song cover.

11:22.751 --> 11:27.076
We're really excited because we really, really like this song from before.

11:27.276 --> 11:33.642
So we're excited to hear when it comes out on December 15th at 4.45pm PT.

11:33.903 --> 11:36.886
Yeah, okay.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.327
Very important time.

11:38.387 --> 11:40.950
It's really before our weekly Advent Club, okay?

11:41.050 --> 11:42.151
So don't forget, okay?

11:42.251 --> 11:43.132
Don't forget, okay?

11:44.673 --> 11:47.295
But you know, Nerissa's such an amazing singer.

11:47.695 --> 11:49.996
And we know that she really likes Idolmaster too.

11:50.276 --> 11:56.160
But you know, we can't really say that we've heard her sing a super cute idol song so far or anything like that.

11:56.180 --> 12:00.702
So, we're really looking forward to it!

12:01.102 --> 12:03.124
Yeah, she's got quite the voice.

12:03.544 --> 12:06.746
It's gonna be cute.

12:07.606 --> 12:08.947
You liked your calendar?

12:09.407 --> 12:10.027
Good, good.

12:12.595 --> 12:15.277
Wow, you know, another Nerissa cover.

12:15.377 --> 12:17.619
I don't know, I feel like we're so lucky.

12:17.639 --> 12:23.904
So many covers, but we're always really looking forward to Nerissa's music and seeing what she does next.

12:24.304 --> 12:25.285
So vote for her!

12:25.365 --> 12:26.786
Make it on your calendar!

12:27.146 --> 12:29.368
Please make sure to check it out, okay?

12:29.809 --> 12:31.610
BAU BAU!

12:33.011 --> 12:35.894
And more happiness, but

12:37.742 --> 12:40.844
FUWAMOCO, we have something exciting coming up!

12:41.324 --> 12:49.028
It was announced that us, FUWAMOCO, will be heading over to Malaysia to appear at ComicFest!

12:49.488 --> 12:55.491
It's gonna be happening in Kuala Lumpur for the first time ever!

12:55.711 --> 12:57.172
BAU BAU!

12:57.272 --> 12:57.412
See us!

13:00.898 --> 13:06.599
As for Ruffians who are a bit further away and can't make it to the event,

13:30.525 --> 13:37.152
It's too bad, but this time you won't be able to join us virtually like how things were like with our last clone appearance.

13:37.272 --> 13:40.115
You know, it was a special case and we were really lucky.

13:40.155 --> 13:41.216
But we're gonna do our best!

13:41.476 --> 13:45.800
And hopefully we'll be able to meet some new Ruffians there too!

13:45.840 --> 13:47.202
We'll do our best, shall we?

13:47.222 --> 13:47.942
Yeah!

13:48.243 --> 13:50.084
BAU BAU!

13:50.104 --> 13:52.507
It's too bad.

13:53.513 --> 13:53.933
BAU BAU!

14:06.627 --> 14:09.269
Also, I had a bit of a scoop.

14:09.409 --> 14:09.969
A scoop!

14:10.590 --> 14:15.954
Ruffians, thank you for reporting directly back to us with your scoops.

14:16.294 --> 14:19.536
Because there was something, something that happened.

14:20.537 --> 14:24.380
And actually, I... I need to sneeze!

14:24.440 --> 14:25.781
It's painful!

14:26.441 --> 14:27.942
That's not the scoop, Moco-chan.

14:29.389 --> 14:30.730
Wow!

14:30.810 --> 14:35.954
You know, Biboo... Biboo, she's on a bit of a roll recently.

14:35.974 --> 14:37.035
A bit of a roll.

14:37.055 --> 14:41.278
Yeah, and she's been playing Super Mario RPG's remake too, right?

14:41.958 --> 14:51.605
Wow... As it turns out... You know, apparently, Biboo also makes a very good sword.

14:51.965 --> 14:53.927
You know, just like Fuwawa happens to be.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.608
Right?

14:56.548 --> 14:57.009
Yeah!

14:58.749 --> 15:02.052
Well, she was showing off her Toad voice to everyone during the stream.

15:02.492 --> 15:11.360
You know which sort of means that Advent officially has two Toad voice appreciators or actors.

15:13.201 --> 15:14.402
Out of all five of us!

15:14.602 --> 15:15.203
Yeah!

15:15.663 --> 15:20.047
You know, but I guess we can't say about Nerissa and Shiori.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.869
We're not sure of the quality of their Toad voice yet.

15:23.350 --> 15:24.751
But Moco-chan's a no.

15:24.791 --> 15:24.911
Yeah!

15:30.369 --> 15:35.916
Moco-chan, since you're no good at it... Who do you think is better, me or Biboo?

15:36.537 --> 15:39.521
I think you're both the same but different toads.

15:39.541 --> 15:43.486
Wait, so I'm like a blue toad and Biboo's like a purple toad?

15:43.526 --> 15:43.767
Yeah.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.145
We'll have to have a toad off later.

15:48.565 --> 15:49.006
Toad off!

15:49.046 --> 15:49.646
BAU BAU!

15:49.686 --> 15:50.346
What?

15:50.386 --> 15:54.708
What do you mean no toad off?

16:04.651 --> 16:06.492
Wow, Ruffians!

16:06.993 --> 16:09.875
There's also something that we noticed recently.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.376
We wanted to say a bit of a thank you.

16:12.456 --> 16:17.180
You know, there's a lot of silly moments in our streams, right?

16:17.200 --> 16:17.280
So...

16:20.538 --> 16:23.420
Also, really thankful for the clippers!

16:23.720 --> 16:27.343
The clippers that, you know, they kinda cut things up a little bit.

16:27.803 --> 16:34.428
And they help us share those moments with lots of Ruffians so that we can protect their smiles a bit easier throughout their busy days.

16:34.468 --> 16:36.389
You know, sometimes there's some, uh...

16:37.310 --> 16:37.670
Pretty.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.011
Silly clips.

16:40.131 --> 16:44.332
But you know, there are also some very thoughtful clips out there too, you know?

16:44.573 --> 16:59.378
Like, the other day during our Yuru hololive Mario Kart stream, with our senpai, you know, we were having some pretty bad technical issues that we just couldn't fix, and you know, it was pretty upsetting for us.

17:00.198 --> 17:00.358
But,

17:01.564 --> 17:07.551
You know, thankfully, we noticed that some Clippers, you know, they helped out.

17:08.031 --> 17:13.037
And they tried to make it look like there wasn't any technical issues or problems during their clips from those moments.

17:13.497 --> 17:15.039
So, we were really happy.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.600
It was very touching.

17:17.061 --> 17:19.384
So nice of my Ruffians.

17:21.214 --> 17:27.439
Thank you so much for being kind and taking the extra step to fix a bit of a frustrating moment for us.

17:27.479 --> 17:29.900
We really appreciate it.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.342
We're really thankful too.

17:32.362 --> 17:34.003
Thank you so much.

17:34.043 --> 17:36.585
Let's continue to put lots of smiles.

17:36.725 --> 17:40.048
BAU BAU!

17:41.569 --> 17:42.990
That's so nice of you.

17:44.082 --> 17:44.763
Wow.

17:45.263 --> 17:48.385
Speaking of nice and happy things.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.006
Ruffians!

17:51.107 --> 17:51.407
Wow.

17:51.908 --> 17:54.449
FUWAMOCO, we've been trying extra hard recently.

17:54.469 --> 17:55.070
Extra hard.

17:55.090 --> 18:01.134
And I think, I don't know, maybe at least it feels like this is the first time in a while now.

18:01.895 --> 18:02.675
Don't say that.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.817
But, Ruffians.

18:06.408 --> 18:08.909
There's been no misunderstandings!

18:09.010 --> 18:09.690
BAU BAU!

18:10.570 --> 18:15.073
No misunderstandings, not a single one!

18:15.193 --> 18:15.814
We did it!

18:15.854 --> 18:21.617
You know, even though we had the Yuru Haru Mario Kart Club with our senpai.

18:21.977 --> 18:22.478
Yeah.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.138
No misunderstandings.

18:24.239 --> 18:24.579
Nothing.

18:24.599 --> 18:25.459
Definitely nothing.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.040
BAU BAU!

18:28.101 --> 18:33.684
We will continue to do our best to have no misunderstandings without this senpai.

18:36.018 --> 18:36.878
For the rest of the month?

18:37.458 --> 18:38.519
The rest of the year!

18:39.439 --> 18:40.599
The rest of the year, I like that.

18:40.699 --> 18:43.220
Oh, you think we can do it for the rest of the year, Ruffians?

18:45.281 --> 18:50.222
I think we can do it, Moco-chan.

18:50.522 --> 18:51.322
Yeah.

18:51.542 --> 18:52.022
We're strong.

18:52.903 --> 18:56.644
BAU BAU!

18:56.704 --> 18:58.224
BAU BAU!

18:59.004 --> 19:00.145
Happy.

19:00.165 --> 19:01.105
Well, Moco-chan.

19:03.826 --> 19:05.106
You know... What?

19:06.314 --> 19:06.974
Ruffians!

19:24.375 --> 19:26.297
This Wednesday, a bad day of the week.

19:26.997 --> 19:28.298
Typically a bad day.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.240
Mainly for Fuwawa, it's a bad day of the week.

19:32.001 --> 19:32.441
Okay.

19:33.242 --> 19:38.385
But, in case I can make you feel a bit, a bit happier.

19:41.728 --> 19:42.648
Ruffians!

19:42.668 --> 19:46.251
I wanted to say something!

19:46.991 --> 19:49.833
So, you better listen up, okay?

19:49.853 --> 19:52.776
Do you know what time this is?

19:53.729 --> 19:54.730
Do you know what this is?

19:55.892 --> 19:59.216
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

19:59.777 --> 20:03.041
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

20:04.123 --> 20:06.286
You, Ruffians!

20:07.127 --> 20:09.370
No, it's almost the end of the year.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.941
I know it can be exciting!

20:12.142 --> 20:16.346
You know, looking forward to holidays and food and fun times!

20:17.107 --> 20:17.387
But!

20:18.068 --> 20:23.373
I also know that it can be a bit rough and that things might not be like that sometimes.

20:24.234 --> 20:31.561
That this is the time of the year where it's easy to feel the pressure and stress from so many different areas!

20:32.482 --> 20:32.643
So...

20:33.746 --> 20:38.430
At the very least, this isn't the time for adding extra stress onto yourself.

20:39.190 --> 20:40.791
Give yourself a break from it all!

20:41.652 --> 20:49.298
You're doing your best just to put up with all the expectations on you, so don't put any more on yourself unnecessarily, okay?

20:51.219 --> 20:52.640
You've done a good job this year.

20:53.241 --> 20:53.821
You know it!

20:54.462 --> 20:54.962
I know it!

20:54.982 --> 20:59.726
You're doing your best to balance everything in your life, so keep on at it!

21:01.215 --> 21:08.725
After all, life is just a silly journey that takes us a bunch of amazing places, even if we never expected it to end up like that.

21:09.406 --> 21:14.894
So, don't worry about the small details, just enjoy the wonderful moments when you're in them, okay?

21:17.020 --> 21:25.610
It's Chiyo, so make sure not to only keep your body warm, but also keep your heart warm and happy too, okay?

21:26.431 --> 21:28.373
It's all gonna be okay!

21:29.274 --> 21:31.637
Let's make it amazing together.

21:32.478 --> 21:33.018
Got it!

21:33.759 --> 21:35.341
Ganbatte de!

21:35.441 --> 21:35.942
BAU BAU!

21:43.507 --> 21:44.948
It's rough, right?

21:45.288 --> 21:47.530
But we can do it, FUWAMOCO!

21:47.610 --> 21:49.711
BAU BAU!

21:49.731 --> 21:51.612
BAU BAU!

21:51.632 --> 21:56.275
With a little bit more pulp, let's go take a look at another pulp.

21:56.595 --> 22:02.259
Because next we'll have the Doggie of the Day!

22:02.279 --> 22:05.341
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

22:05.621 --> 22:06.742
De-den!

22:06.762 --> 22:11.163
It's Gizmo!

22:11.263 --> 22:12.604
Gizmo is tiny.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.805
It's a chihuahua.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.766
I'm a chihuahua!

22:18.166 --> 22:19.547
I'm Gizmo!

22:21.748 --> 22:23.388
But you know Gizmo's expression.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.750
It sure looks like you woke him up from a good nap.

22:26.770 --> 22:27.370
It does.

22:33.370 --> 22:34.030
Well, how does Gizmo BAU BAU?

22:34.050 --> 22:34.370
BAU BAU.

22:34.790 --> 22:35.010
Really?

22:35.030 --> 22:35.350
Gizmo's timing!

22:35.371 --> 22:36.211
In this expression, this movement.

22:36.231 --> 22:36.491
BAU BAU.

22:36.511 --> 22:37.911
But normally, after he's awake.

22:39.151 --> 23:01.097
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

23:05.413 --> 23:08.236
Gizmo.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.221
Gizmo is as tiny as a gizmo.

23:12.401 --> 23:13.442
Very cute!

23:15.629 --> 23:15.829
BAU BAU!

23:37.973 --> 23:38.794
De-den!

23:53.147 --> 23:54.548
A bit of a vacation.

23:55.149 --> 24:02.597
I don't know, you know, I've been seeing all the cold and snowy landscapes, so this is quite a bit different.

24:02.637 --> 24:04.238
This is the exact opposite.

24:04.258 --> 24:06.240
This looks hot!

24:06.300 --> 24:09.183
Like the type of place Peru wants to be right now, hot.

24:10.244 --> 24:14.807
I don't know why, but when I see a cactus, I feel like I want to hug it.

24:14.867 --> 24:15.947
I don't know why.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.703
Brain says no, heart says yes.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.006
BAU BAU!

24:34.026 --> 24:37.949
Ruffians, please, good times.

24:37.969 --> 24:42.293
Make sure you go on walks, especially even if it's cold outside.

24:43.013 --> 24:45.935
It's good, you know, just getting some fresh air.

24:46.135 --> 24:47.295
But please be safe.

24:47.455 --> 24:52.718
And for the Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

24:52.738 --> 24:54.879
Hi FUWAMOCO!

24:54.899 --> 24:59.581
It's almost time to start preparing for the next big holiday, Christmas.

24:59.621 --> 25:03.703
To prepare, do you buy a real pine tree or an artificial tree?

25:03.723 --> 25:06.664
Good question.

25:06.704 --> 25:09.726
See, there are lots of trees in the northwest past.

25:10.564 --> 25:17.887
So, as puppies, we always look forward to going out and finding a good tree together with Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.887
You know, the perfect tree.

25:20.428 --> 25:27.330
And the color, good smell, and whether it's fluffy or fuzzy enough, always important.

25:27.830 --> 25:34.033
You know, but also, always wanted to get the tallest tree possible!

25:34.053 --> 25:34.853
Like, really!

25:35.911 --> 25:37.152
It's okay, maybe.

25:37.252 --> 25:39.393
Yeah, but it just doesn't smell right now.

26:07.039 --> 26:07.800
Oh, well, you know.

26:07.820 --> 26:08.920
It's how things are.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.922
Maybe it's better that way.

26:11.182 --> 26:14.484
BAU BAU!

26:15.004 --> 26:18.846
Good luck, Ruffians, with all your holiday preparations, okay?

26:19.187 --> 26:22.929
But, like Moco-chan said, don't worry too much about it.

26:22.949 --> 26:23.249
Okay?

26:23.509 --> 26:25.430
Good luck.

26:25.631 --> 26:28.853
Don't get worked up unnecessarily, okay?

26:29.613 --> 26:31.854
Wow, what do we have, Moco-chan?

26:32.235 --> 26:32.355
Oh!

26:33.155 --> 26:34.536
First, I want to say something.

26:34.956 --> 26:35.937
Oh, first, what?

26:38.203 --> 26:50.551
Thank you always for all your submissions, for sending us your questions, sharing us your doggies, and also thank you for your FUWAMOCO scoop too!

26:50.631 --> 26:59.937
Please don't forget the hashtag FWMC scoop for the scoops, and the hashtag FWMCMORNING for your morning.

26:59.977 --> 27:00.617
BAU BAU!

27:00.857 --> 27:04.420
As for our next theme,

27:05.160 --> 27:08.261
We have de-den!

27:08.541 --> 27:12.782
We're gonna be playing Home Sweet Home on Biboo's channel!

27:12.922 --> 27:14.222
Is Biboo in this photo?

27:14.242 --> 27:15.503
Almost.

27:15.943 --> 27:18.643
We're playing episode 2!

27:18.683 --> 27:25.145
I know we finished the first game with Biboo back in October, but we left off on such a cliffhanger.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.726
Okay, what's our wife's name?

27:28.686 --> 27:29.186
Jennifer.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.782
Ruffians, is that our wife's name?

27:33.023 --> 27:33.664
Jennifer.

27:34.225 --> 27:35.006
Not Tina.

27:36.408 --> 27:36.829
Tina?

27:38.031 --> 27:38.312
Jane?

27:41.172 --> 27:45.554
I don't know, but once we find her, we'll be able to find out what her name was again.

27:45.734 --> 27:47.615
Yeah, once we find her.

27:47.955 --> 27:49.675
Get our wife back.

27:50.316 --> 27:51.736
BAU BAU!

27:52.296 --> 27:55.597
After our schedule!

27:55.657 --> 28:04.781
Ruffians, we have a lot of plans this week, but on Saturday, we're gonna be having our second unarchived Rock n' Rawr Party!

28:04.861 --> 28:06.361
Yeah, the second ever!

28:06.381 --> 28:07.842
Second ever, you know.

28:08.422 --> 28:12.165
You know, it's kind of looking a bit fancy there.

28:12.285 --> 28:13.226
Just maybe.

28:13.246 --> 28:19.771
Please get ready to sing some very special holiday songs with us, okay, Ruffians?

28:19.791 --> 28:20.212
Okay!

28:20.252 --> 28:21.133
Don't miss it!

28:21.893 --> 28:24.676
BAU BAU!

28:24.796 --> 28:27.678
And that's just a little peek at what we have coming up.

28:28.218 --> 28:32.362
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

28:32.382 --> 28:32.902
Thank you!

28:34.704 --> 28:41.327
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

28:41.387 --> 28:41.687

29:04.544 --> 29:06.285

29:06.305 --> 29:07.146
Asteroids.

29:07.166 --> 29:07.906

29:07.926 --> 29:09.047
Voice-sama.

29:09.348 --> 29:09.888

29:09.948 --> 29:10.349
Jun.

29:10.669 --> 29:11.730
BAU BAU!

29:14.712 --> 29:24.140
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

29:24.221 --> 29:27.543
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

29:27.724 --> 29:30.586
