00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:06.000
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.063
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:08.783
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:22.010
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.952
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:26.614
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:29.997
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:30.337 --> 00:05:33.460
Thank you for joining us for our fourth episode!

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:43.024
To explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:43.884
FUWAMOCO.

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.225
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:51.606
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:56.708
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.689
And let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.449
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.090
BAU BAU!

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.753
To start the day off.

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:07.179
We have some important news.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.142
Important news.

00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:10.187
Pero.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:11.289
Pero.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.240
Can you help us find him, Ruffians?

00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:41.862
Do you have any ideas where he might have gone?

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:47.294
Maybe he went to go train?

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:50.455
A tropical vacation.

00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:53.478
Maybe he went to the casino?

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:55.580
Casino sounds maybe.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.501
We didn't bully him, no!

00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:58.822
He's in our hearts.

00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:00.203
He's in our hearts?

00:07:00.223 --> 00:07:01.464
That sounds really sad.

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:03.046
Not here on the screen.

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:04.587
He's there, but not like that.

00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:08.510
Maybe he'll be with us today for when we need him in Typing for the Dead.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.351
Let's hope.

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:10.772
Typing of the Dead.

00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:13.494
I said Typing for the Dead.

00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:15.196
Typing of the Dead.

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:16.256
Of the Dead.

00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:19.441
He went for milk?

00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:20.862
A secret mission.

00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:23.122
Does Pero like milk?

00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:25.923
I don't even know what he likes to eat.

00:07:25.943 --> 00:07:27.044
He just has all the scraps.

00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:28.624
Doesn't really matter.

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:32.745
If you see him, let us know with the hashtag FUWAMOCOMORNING.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.006
FWMCMORNING.

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:37.407
Let us know where he's going if you have any... What's it?

00:07:37.547 --> 00:07:37.907
Tips?

00:07:38.347 --> 00:07:38.807
No tips.

00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:39.948
Information.

00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:40.648
Information.

00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:42.929
Pero Sightings.

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:43.909
Pero Sightings, yeah.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:49.171
And on more information... Yeah, from FUWAMOCO.

00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:50.872
Directly to you.

00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:51.813
De-den!

00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:54.855
We have more information about Super Chibi Greetings!

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:57.536
We're really, really thankful for all your support.

00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:02.019
Especially, especially during our monetization celebration stream over the weekend.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.921
I hope, I hope it got to your heart.

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:14.267
We've read all of the messages that you sent us, but we're sorry that we haven't been able to read them all and properly take a moment to say thank you to you yet, but...

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:21.690
We'll be doing a special Super Chat Reading stream for our monetization stream and the streams following very shortly.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:31.074
But starting today, we'll be beginning a Super Chat Reading segment after every stream.

00:08:31.254 --> 00:08:33.315
Minus FUWAMOCO Mornings.

00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:34.155
Important, important.

00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:49.043
We feel really happy that we've been able to spend a week together and know a bit more about us, but we also feel that it's kind of unfair because we want to be able to spend more time getting to know you more closely too.

00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:56.546
So we hope that being able to read the Super Chats and spend time chatting together every day will give us a bit more time to get to know you.

00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:58.107
Is that okay, Ruffians?

00:08:58.527 --> 00:08:59.328
Does that sound good?

00:08:59.388 --> 00:08:59.888
Sounds good.

00:08:59.968 --> 00:09:00.469
BAU BAU.

00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:01.229
BAU BAU.

00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:01.830
Sounds good.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.370
Okay.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.371
Good!

00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:05.272
We're looking forward to it!

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:06.733
Yeah!

00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:07.474
Three hours?

00:09:07.974 --> 00:09:10.236
Maybe not three hours.

00:09:10.296 --> 00:09:12.318
We'll go slowly but surely.

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:12.998
Okay.

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:15.060
Thank you!

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.901
BAU BAU!

00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.242
BAU BAU!

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:21.064
I think it's time for the next segment.

00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:24.427
It's very popular, but not popular with FUWAMOCO.

00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:29.013
Is this segment again?

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:31.954
There's been another misunderstanding.

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:35.276
First.

00:09:36.317 --> 00:09:46.903
First, we wanted to say thank you for all your warm comments and all your thoughts that you've been tweeting about FUWAMOCO Morning on Twitter with the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:09:47.323 --> 00:09:48.183
Ruffians are very good.

00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:48.744
They listen.

00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:49.884
Yeah, they listen.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.005
That's quite good.

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:52.606
Good Ruffians.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:56.528
We've been really really happy that you've been enjoying this program together with us so much.

00:09:57.688 --> 00:10:00.150
Ah, but there's one thing.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.771
A bit of a misunderstanding.

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:04.252
You know, uh, we're really happy!

00:10:04.272 --> 00:10:07.094
And we're sure that it's out of affection too, but...

00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:09.524
FUWAMOCO Morning, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:09.564 --> 00:10:10.805
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:11.906 --> 00:10:17.171
And if not, a different, a different... Like, sometimes you might be, it's a bit of a mouthful.

00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:17.951
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:18.792
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:18.832 --> 00:10:19.853
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:25.538
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight syllables.

00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:27.099
Something like that.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.085
So you might want to call it something shorter, but... Moco-chan, please, please don't call it...

00:10:36.687 --> 00:10:37.167
That's embarrassing!

00:10:38.108 --> 00:10:39.529
Please don't call us Moco.

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:43.533
It just sounds wrong.

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:49.558
Like, you know when you're getting your fur pet backwards?

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:54.042
We could shorten the name to like, FUWAMO!

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:55.123
FUWAMO!

00:10:55.523 --> 00:10:56.604
Or like, FUWAMON!

00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:57.685
FUWAMON!

00:10:58.846 --> 00:10:59.587
Like Kumamon!

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:02.229
Shit!

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:03.150
Like Kumamon!

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:07.216
You know, Ruffians, do you have any other ideas?

00:11:08.357 --> 00:11:08.637
Yeah!

00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:09.557
Let's hear them.

00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:10.158
Fuwamomo?

00:11:10.178 --> 00:11:10.698
Fuwamomo?

00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:11.419
Fuwamomo?

00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:12.219
Oh, that's cute.

00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:14.261
But why don't you just call it Fuwamoco then?

00:11:17.023 --> 00:11:17.683
Agumon?

00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:19.904
That's not right.

00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:23.427
Well, we'll all have to think together maybe.

00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:26.949
Otherwise, Fuwamo is the decision for now.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.230
Okay!

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.831
Okay.

00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:29.651
Understand?

00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:30.332
Good!

00:11:31.554 --> 00:11:35.198
There's also another misunderstanding too!

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:56.636
Yesterday, while we were in Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion, you know, Fuwawa might have said something that shocked you.

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.798
But honestly, it sort of shocked her too.

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:00.858
It did.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:06.422
You know, she got scared because she started to hear the growl sounds that Bloobs make.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:07.203
Bloobs!

00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:10.245
And a lot of the Ruffians got confused, but...

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:17.382
We actually realized that it makes sense that you were confused because you don't know what a Bloob is.

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:18.703
This is a Bloob.

00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:21.004
We're going to introduce it to you.

00:12:21.045 --> 00:12:21.705
It's a Bloob.

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.486
Bloobs are found in the wild.

00:12:23.506 --> 00:12:27.009
Why are you laughing, Moco-chan?

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.590
Can you say L?

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.931
Bloobs.

00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:29.571
Bloobs.

00:12:30.272 --> 00:12:30.612
Bloobs.

00:12:30.632 --> 00:12:30.792
Bloobs.

00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:38.239
Okay, introduce them.

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:38.659
Okay.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.743
They're found in the Northwest Passage, and they're similar to gloobs, but they're not gloobs.

00:12:44.203 --> 00:12:46.185
They're bloobs!

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.206
Bloobs are blue, and gloobs are green.

00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:48.727
Yeah.

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:49.867
Yeah.

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:55.191
I don't know, maybe some people are more scared of the gloobs, but I don't like them.

00:12:55.392 --> 00:12:57.593
I think bloobs are more frightening.

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:04.218
Sometimes you might come across a really, really big bloob inside dark light caves, so you have to be careful.

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:08.301
That's why huawuas are scary.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:09.863
They can be pretty scary.

00:13:10.483 --> 00:13:11.904
A bit vicious.

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:13.506
It looks pretty simple.

00:13:13.606 --> 00:13:17.929
They make sort of a blub blub blub blub blub blub sound.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:21.572
So you really need to use your ears to be able to look out for them.

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:24.635
Otherwise you know you're in for maybe a dangerous time.

00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:28.718
I want to say that I'm sorry for raising my voice at you Ruffians.

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:29.438
What about me?

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:36.344
Mococo, you're different, you're different.

00:13:36.604 --> 00:13:41.127
I was confused because you didn't really understand me, but now it all makes sense, you know?

00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:43.909
Because you don't find them in the human world.

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:44.469
That's nice.

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:48.673
But yeah, there's no misunderstanding now, right?

00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:52.035
You don't need to worry about poops, so... Good?

00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:52.976
We're good.

00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:55.698
Misunderstanding solved!

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.987
Thank you Moco-chan for the drawing.

00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:03.548
You're welcome.

00:14:03.568 --> 00:14:04.808
Can you apologize to me?

00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:08.569
Do you hurt Moco-chan?

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:09.349
I hurt.

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:10.450
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.550
It doesn't make me feel better.

00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:16.671
It was supposed to, I meant it.

00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:17.791
Did you though?

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:18.772
Is it though?

00:14:19.952 --> 00:14:22.533
I'm sorry for raising my voice at you and the Ruffians.

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:27.489
Ruffians, do you think she sounds sincere?

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.569
Huh?

00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:31.851
I don't.

00:14:32.552 --> 00:14:32.972
I don't.

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:34.133
I'm sincere, though.

00:14:36.454 --> 00:14:36.794
Yeah?

00:14:36.894 --> 00:14:37.255
No?

00:14:37.595 --> 00:14:37.835
Yeah?

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:38.796
Yeah?

00:14:39.356 --> 00:14:39.796
Yeah!

00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:40.717
Maybe not!

00:14:41.617 --> 00:14:41.938
Okay.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:42.638
Next!

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:46.420
Okay.

00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:48.822
We have something important to say.

00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:52.650
Another confession.

00:14:54.611 --> 00:15:00.336
So, we wanted to say, you know, there's something I think a lot of Ruffians enjoy this.

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:00.696
Yeah.

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:05.440
But actually, for FUWAMOCO, it's really embarrassing.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.681
It's a bit embarrassing.

00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:12.326
And it's something that we've been kind of self-conscious about for a long, long, long, long time.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:13.600
Yeah.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.581
Just sometimes.

00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:14.721
Yeah.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.581
It's actually really, really embarrassing.

00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:30.161
Yeah, we don't want to do it.

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.302
But we just can't not do it.

00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:33.462
Yeah, it just happens.

00:15:33.722 --> 00:15:34.863
Right, you know?

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:40.224
But it's really embarrassing when we do it because it feels like we're screaming out to the world like, we're twins!

00:15:40.244 --> 00:15:41.565
Do you understand that we're twins?

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:42.425
We're twins, you know?

00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:45.166
We don't want it to be like that, you know?

00:15:46.106 --> 00:15:52.089
You know like, when you go out and you want to get like a special puppertino, the cashier will greet you, right?

00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:55.390
And we both say, hello BAU BAU.

00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:01.072
And then they get all surprised and go, oh my gosh, are you two twins?

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:03.593
And then we say, oh yes.

00:16:04.794 --> 00:16:07.415
And then they ask, are you identical?

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.035
You look exactly alike!

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:09.716
And then we say,

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:10.956
Yes.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:15.558
So then they ask, oh, who's the older one?

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:31.146
Yeah, and then I have to explain that I'm the oldest, but my birthday's actually different, on a different day than Moco-chan, and then Mama Puppyhouse should work really hard, and then, you know, suddenly they know a lot about us, you know, we just wanted to slip in and order and disappear.

00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:33.067
Yeah, just get the Puppertino and go, you know.

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.269
It's already embarrassing enough having ears and a tail.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:39.752
We don't want to stand out even more.

00:16:39.812 --> 00:16:42.014
Sometimes you just want to go, right?

00:16:42.575 --> 00:16:49.583
But we are happy that Ruffians that you enjoy it, but for us we'd really prefer if we didn't harmonize on everything.

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:51.725
Do you understand?

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.326
Very relatable.

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:55.027
Relatable.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.767
It's cute though.

00:16:57.528 --> 00:16:59.148
I'm glad you find it cute though.

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:07.132
You know, as long as we do it that you smile a lot and maybe praise Moco-chan too.

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:09.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:11.393
You're not forgetting, right?

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:13.294
It'll be okay.

00:17:13.314 --> 00:17:16.356
Maybe we won't feel so self-conscious about it.

00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:17.436
But maybe.

00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:19.537
We'll be counting on you, okay, Ruffians?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.420
Okay!

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:25.062
Got it!

00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:26.783
I don't know, it's really weird.

00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:27.503
It just happens.

00:17:28.403 --> 00:17:29.924
It just happens.

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:31.305
We can't stop doing it.

00:17:31.325 --> 00:17:36.067
I wish we could stop doing it.

00:17:36.487 --> 00:17:37.747
Confession done!

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.048
Next!

00:17:39.428 --> 00:17:40.568
We have something fun!

00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:42.308
De-den!

00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:45.452
Akihabara Mister Donut.

00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:52.682
So you might remember, but during our Q&A stream we were asked what one of our favorite places in the world was.

00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:57.808
And so we said that the Mister Donut location, Akihabara, is our favorite.

00:17:58.729 --> 00:18:06.015
We've actually been receiving many many reports from the Ruffians that they've been doing Seichi Jundai, like the sacred anime pilgrimages.

00:18:06.035 --> 00:18:06.575
Yeah!

00:18:06.735 --> 00:18:07.176
What?

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:08.116
Pilgrimages!

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.658
To the Akihabara Mister Donut location.

00:18:10.718 --> 00:18:12.580
They're having pon-de-rings too!

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.381
Our favorite!

00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:14.662
Look look look!

00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:18.603
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for making the journey.

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:41.531
You know what, we've also been told that even some hololive staff members have been going and doing Seiji Junrei there too!

00:18:42.191 --> 00:18:43.311
It's not just you, you know?

00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:45.712
It's that great of a spot.

00:18:46.572 --> 00:18:48.752
Everyone's taking the recommendations.

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:55.774
Actually, we've been seeing too that sometimes there's actually even no pon-de-rings.

00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:56.855
Yeah.

00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:57.696
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:23.037
So I guess for some more info, it's actually been around in Akihabara since 1972.

00:19:23.317 --> 00:19:23.758
Yeah.

00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:28.420
So it's been there the whole time throughout all the changes of Akihabara.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.880
Right.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.500
It's always there.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.921
Akihabara's changed so much, especially recently.

00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.462
Yeah!

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.191
Our favorite place.

00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:37.732
No, we just really love this place.

00:19:38.132 --> 00:19:40.894
So we wanted to share it with you.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:41.774
Is that okay?

00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:48.938
But our favorite order is, first you order as many pond rings as you need.

00:19:49.018 --> 00:19:51.259
Or I guess maybe not as many as you can get.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.342
And you get the milk tea to go with the royal milk tea.

00:19:57.543 --> 00:20:01.626
We recommend the hot over the cold, which is actually usually the opposite.

00:20:01.646 --> 00:20:03.387
We usually prefer the cold milk tea.

00:20:03.427 --> 00:20:07.569
Cold milk tea is yummy, but Misudo's hot milk tea is really good.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.631
Milk tea here actually has free refills if you ask.

00:20:10.912 --> 00:20:11.692
Misudo.

00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:17.336
But we recommend not doing that at the location, like Akihabara location, because it's just really small.

00:20:17.356 --> 00:20:19.057
It's very busy.

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:26.344
If you go to a more faraway location, you know, sometimes the staff will even come by and ask if you want to refill in the park.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:27.605
You don't even need to move.

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:30.288
Yeah, you can be studying and all that.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:30.928
Right?

00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:31.589
It's perfect.

00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:32.950
Truly royal.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:39.296
Yeah, and it's like, this milk tea, it's a perfect balance of bitter and strong taste.

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:43.099
So then when you mix it with the sweetness of the ponzu, it's just perfect.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.141
You don't eat anything else.

00:20:45.242 --> 00:20:47.103
Mister Donut knows his stuff.

00:20:48.224 --> 00:20:49.205
He obviously does.

00:20:50.106 --> 00:20:52.088
So we recommend that you try them together.

00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:56.652
Actually, this is a bit embarrassing.

00:20:58.339 --> 00:20:59.780
You say it.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.001
Why do I have to say it?

00:21:01.041 --> 00:21:03.003
It's embarrassing, so... Okay.

00:21:03.383 --> 00:21:03.923
Ah, what's it?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.164
Mame-tsushiki time.

00:21:05.885 --> 00:21:06.205
Yeah.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.446
The bean knowledge time.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:07.686
Yeah.

00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:08.187
Chibbit.

00:21:08.687 --> 00:21:08.887
Yeah.

00:21:09.488 --> 00:21:15.112
So we have actually ordered a hundred pond rings at once from this location, Akihabara, before.

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:15.993
Yeah.

00:21:16.293 --> 00:21:18.175
And we still have the receipt up on our fridge.

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:19.176
It was a big deal.

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:20.857
Yeah, it was a big deal.

00:21:20.877 --> 00:21:20.957
Yeah.

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:25.445
Yes, a hundred.

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:27.106
A hundred, exactly a hundred.

00:21:27.846 --> 00:21:30.687
You had to order it well in advance.

00:21:31.067 --> 00:21:33.328
Moco-chan, you look so happy with them though.

00:21:33.448 --> 00:21:34.128
I was!

00:21:34.188 --> 00:21:34.468
Right?

00:21:34.508 --> 00:21:37.409
Look at my treasures!

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:40.030
Yeah, I wonder what the staff thought, huh?

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.171
They must have thought it was a big party.

00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.051
Ah, maybe.

00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:45.091
That's a bit...

00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:47.673
But!

00:21:47.853 --> 00:21:48.014
But!

00:21:48.074 --> 00:21:48.254
But!

00:21:48.314 --> 00:21:48.494
But!

00:21:48.815 --> 00:21:56.565
If you do go to the Akihabara Mister Donut, please, we recommend that you enjoy a pon-de-ring from the second floor seats if you have time.

00:21:56.886 --> 00:22:00.551
For FUWAMOCO, we prefer the seats to the right side of the big window.

00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:02.513
So, if you can sit there.

00:22:03.294 --> 00:22:04.695
Extra Special.

00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:07.316
The left side is good too, but the right side is preferred.

00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:11.999
And most importantly... Number one, most important.

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:18.362
Make sure that you remember your manners, and be kind to others in the area enjoying their downtime too, okay?

00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:21.343
No BAU BAUing too loud, okay?

00:22:21.443 --> 00:22:23.324
You have to be a good Ruffian, okay?

00:22:23.364 --> 00:22:25.546
Make FUWAMOCO proud.

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:28.447
We just really love the space.

00:22:28.727 --> 00:22:29.067
Right?

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.649
We wanted you to love it too.

00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:32.289
BAU BAU.

00:22:32.349 --> 00:22:33.210
Okay, BAU BAU.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.690
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:37.112
Please treat us nicely, okay?

00:22:37.132 --> 00:22:42.254
And thank you for the pon-de-ring for two!

00:22:42.374 --> 00:22:44.335
Thank you!

00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:47.577
Okay, now we'll go to our regular segment.

00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:51.479
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:22:53.267 --> 00:22:55.528
It's Queenie Beanie!

00:22:56.988 --> 00:22:59.028
She's the goobest girl ever.

00:22:59.188 --> 00:22:59.669
Goobest.

00:22:59.709 --> 00:23:01.649
Yeah, different from the gloobs.

00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:04.210
Very, very different.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.510
Gloobs don't look this cute.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.571
Yeah, there's no green either.

00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:09.391
No, no green.

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.611
Actually, you can tell it's the gloob.

00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:17.433
But Queenie Beanie's a very happy girl with three paws and her barks are very loud.

00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:18.193
Very loud.

00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:18.813
Very loud.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.373
What would it sound like, Moco-chan?

00:23:21.654 --> 00:23:23.016
Very loud one.

00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:23.838
Kind of loud, maybe.

00:23:23.878 --> 00:23:24.559
Kind of loud.

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:27.304
Maybe like BAU BAU!

00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:37.622
I feel like maybe it's a bit more of a cuter sound.

00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:40.603
The tongue is good, right?

00:23:41.063 --> 00:23:42.144
Very happy tongue.

00:23:42.184 --> 00:23:45.005
Yeah, it kind of looks like candy, right?

00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:47.326
And the tummy is up!

00:23:47.366 --> 00:23:49.387
And the fashion of a bow.

00:23:49.487 --> 00:23:50.027
Very cute.

00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:54.649
She looks so happy.

00:23:54.729 --> 00:23:57.751
Yeah, like she's just ready to play and play and play!

00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:03.493
I think our rating of Queenie Beanie, you know, she never wants to leave your side.

00:24:03.894 --> 00:24:07.895
She likes to play lots, but she also likes to cuddle too.

00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:10.297
Definitely the coolest girl for sure.

00:24:10.877 --> 00:24:11.517
Good ears.

00:24:12.338 --> 00:24:13.898
She has a lot.

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:15.279
Thank you!

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:17.040
BAU BAU!

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.553
For our next segment, today I went for a walk.

00:24:23.053 --> 00:24:23.573
On a walk.

00:24:23.953 --> 00:24:24.173
De-den!

00:24:29.162 --> 00:24:31.623
Such a pretty scene.

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:32.904
Is it sunset or sunrise?

00:24:33.024 --> 00:24:33.765
I think sunrise.

00:24:33.785 --> 00:24:36.406
We didn't go for a walk, we went for a run!

00:24:36.486 --> 00:24:38.467
Wow, that's impressive.

00:24:39.048 --> 00:24:39.488
You know?

00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:43.570
And a run with just that kind of beautiful scenery too.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.591
And swans!

00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:47.392
Was there anyone else around or is it just all to yourself?

00:24:48.013 --> 00:24:50.094
I guess the swans were there.

00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:50.814
That kind of counts.

00:24:50.874 --> 00:24:51.314
I guess.

00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:54.276
You know, it's really nice when you see special things like this.

00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:56.517
Because then that just makes everything more special.

00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:56.737
Right!

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:57.298
You know?

00:24:58.038 --> 00:25:00.860
Sometimes the days can kind of feel like all the same, right?

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.804
But then, you come across something like this and you really really treasure every day you have, right?

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:13.489
It's also nice that even though you went running that you took a moment to enjoy all your surroundings too.

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:16.732
It's good to take a moment like that, right?

00:25:17.132 --> 00:25:19.594
I'd really like to be able to go here too, so...

00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:27.258
I hope that at least you can go and see this beautiful mirror water everyday.

00:25:27.318 --> 00:25:29.260
Just be careful of the swans, okay?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.722
Sometimes they can be kinda mean.

00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:32.603
They look pretty though.

00:25:32.623 --> 00:25:35.086
You never know with birds, okay?

00:25:36.347 --> 00:25:36.968
Thank you!

00:25:37.188 --> 00:25:38.850
BAU BAU!

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:42.553
And for our Question of the Day today...

00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:54.005
Thank you for using our hashtag!

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:58.108
Both of you are probably the first VTubers to share a channel like this.

00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:00.451
Are there any challenges to sharing these things?

00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:03.414
Do you argue over what to play or anything like that?

00:26:03.994 --> 00:26:04.895
Thank you for the question.

00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:06.237
This is a good question.

00:26:07.197 --> 00:26:10.781
Actually, we're not the first VTubers to share a channel.

00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.843
It's Omesis and Pokopi.

00:26:13.724 --> 00:26:17.808
But maybe we're the first VTubers who mainly do live content together, maybe?

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.270
Maybe.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.073
But you might think there are a lot of challenges, but...

00:26:25.387 --> 00:26:25.707
There isn't.

00:26:26.147 --> 00:26:26.427
No.

00:26:26.707 --> 00:26:27.167
I don't think so.

00:26:27.227 --> 00:26:27.988
I don't think so.

00:26:28.048 --> 00:26:28.188
No?

00:26:28.528 --> 00:26:28.748
No.

00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:29.928
Yeah.

00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:30.728
It's normal.

00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:32.589
It's normal.

00:26:32.729 --> 00:26:34.429
We don't argue over what to play.

00:26:34.449 --> 00:26:41.031
More than anything, how we feel is like, if we play the game then that's just how we get to spend with you.

00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:41.451
Yeah.

00:26:41.471 --> 00:26:42.391
The game is a bonus.

00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:42.791
Yeah.

00:26:42.811 --> 00:26:45.052
You know, we just want to make you smile the most.

00:26:45.152 --> 00:26:48.373
So... Do you argue about what you want to do?

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:50.840
Ruffians.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.881
No arguments, no arguments.

00:26:52.941 --> 00:26:53.982
No, no arguments.

00:26:54.002 --> 00:26:54.683
Why would we argue?

00:26:54.703 --> 00:26:56.044
Why would we have kerfuffles?

00:26:56.544 --> 00:26:58.126
It's like... Why would we argue?

00:26:58.146 --> 00:27:00.248
Moco-chan, I want that piece of chicken.

00:27:00.308 --> 00:27:01.128
Can you not share?

00:27:01.148 --> 00:27:03.811
Can you not share?

00:27:03.851 --> 00:27:06.433
Can you not decide on another thing?

00:27:06.933 --> 00:27:07.334
Right?

00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:08.054
Right?

00:27:08.134 --> 00:27:08.955
It's not that hard.

00:27:08.975 --> 00:27:11.217
There's lots and lots of these, right?

00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:15.400
But yeah, I feel like the game is just a bonus to being able to be here with you.

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:21.584
I guess when it comes to other things, you know we split the work more or less evenly, like we do most tasks.

00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:27.508
But this also kind of means that, I guess our skill trees can kind of get uneven.

00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:36.133
Because like, maybe I'll do the cooking more, I'll learn more recipes, and Moco-chan will do more of the computer stuff, so then I'm better at computers and I'm not so great.

00:27:36.313 --> 00:27:38.914
So that's not the greatest, because then I depend on you.

00:27:38.934 --> 00:27:39.495
I can cook though.

00:27:40.776 --> 00:27:41.437
I can.

00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:42.558
I can.

00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:45.280
I can unzip files, too.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.901
I can do it.

00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:48.562
Can you, though?

00:27:48.822 --> 00:27:52.185
It might take me a couple minutes to panic, but I can!

00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:56.488
Oh, but... Fuwawa's not allowed to download anything.

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.170
Okay, story time!

00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.850
Story time!

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.792
Do we have time for this, Moco-chan?

00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:05.754
One time, she downloaded something.

00:28:07.335 --> 00:28:09.157
And for the first time,

00:28:10.998 --> 00:28:11.738
We got a virus.

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:19.102
It was supposed to be just like a happy nice free font, but... No.

00:28:20.043 --> 00:28:20.603
It caught me.

00:28:20.863 --> 00:28:21.144
Yeah.

00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:23.205
We aren't good at that stuff.

00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:24.405
No.

00:28:24.886 --> 00:28:26.006
But it's okay now, right?

00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:26.967
It took a long time.

00:28:26.987 --> 00:28:28.468
I was very panicked.

00:28:28.908 --> 00:28:30.969
I'm not gonna do anything, so it's okay now.

00:28:30.989 --> 00:28:32.750
So now she's not allowed to download things.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.091
Yeah, I know.

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:39.295
But other than things like that, I guess...was that an argument?

00:28:39.795 --> 00:28:40.795
No, that was just a panic.

00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:47.738
That was just a panic, so that probably sounded more like Spooky's jump scare, didn't it?

00:28:48.258 --> 00:28:51.419
Don't just let your guard down because it's a free font, okay?

00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:52.099
Ruffians!

00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:00.005
But yeah, I think there's a lot of Ruffians out there thinking that it must be really difficult, but really it isn't.

00:29:00.345 --> 00:29:02.186
It's not complicated to us, you know?

00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:05.929
We just do our thing, and we share like we've been doing our entire lives.

00:29:05.969 --> 00:29:06.510
So don't worry.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.292
For us there really aren't any challenges at all.

00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:11.353
No, it's just normal.

00:29:11.673 --> 00:29:12.534
Just normal.

00:29:13.955 --> 00:29:15.396
It was a free font!

00:29:20.095 --> 00:29:21.136
Yeah, gotta be careful.

00:29:21.476 --> 00:29:23.577
We're very challenged with computers.

00:29:25.257 --> 00:29:30.219
Anyways, we'll go to our next tier here.

00:29:30.339 --> 00:29:30.779
De-den!

00:29:30.879 --> 00:29:34.080
Our next tier!

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.061
We'll be back to hitting the keyboards loads today.

00:29:37.461 --> 00:29:41.622
As we go back down to down zombies.

00:29:41.762 --> 00:29:42.703
Back to down the zombies.

00:29:42.803 --> 00:29:43.843
And typing from the dead.

00:29:47.104 --> 00:29:48.766
Typing of the Dead!

00:29:49.826 --> 00:29:54.229
I guess it'd be nice if we typed for the dead because, you know, maybe... Oh, because they can't type.

00:29:54.249 --> 00:29:56.471
Their fingers aren't as nimble and they can't write.

00:29:56.611 --> 00:29:57.292
Typing for the dead.

00:29:57.952 --> 00:29:59.914
No, we're typing of the dead.

00:30:01.315 --> 00:30:03.536
We played a bit last time.

00:30:03.596 --> 00:30:05.518
It's a bit of a different flavour of a game.

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:11.382
I'm not too sure what to expect, but we're gonna hope that we can get through the rest of the game.

00:30:11.702 --> 00:30:12.983
And maybe, what was his name?

00:30:13.003 --> 00:30:13.643
Washington?

00:30:14.244 --> 00:30:14.884
Washington.

00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:15.325
G.

00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:16.586
De-den!

00:30:46.718 --> 00:30:47.939
You memorized it, right?

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.601
Of course.

00:30:51.403 --> 00:30:59.171
Well, again, on Saturday we have another FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party, but this time with hololive songs only.

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:04.436
We just finished contacting our senpai to ask if we can sing their songs.

00:31:05.737 --> 00:31:06.398
Guess what they said.

00:31:11.394 --> 00:31:12.395
They all said yes!

00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:13.917
We can sing the song!

00:31:13.957 --> 00:31:15.599
But we were really, really nervous.

00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:17.801
We were really, really, really nervous.

00:31:19.163 --> 00:31:20.324
Fuwawa, is this okay?

00:31:21.185 --> 00:31:22.126
Does this look okay?

00:31:22.246 --> 00:31:22.687
I don't know.

00:31:22.887 --> 00:31:23.347
I don't know.

00:31:23.588 --> 00:31:24.188
I don't know.

00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:25.069
It took a while.

00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:25.990
It took a while.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.572
You'd be nervous too, right?

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:28.013
Right.

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:28.313
Right.

00:31:28.813 --> 00:31:29.174
Yeah.

00:31:29.574 --> 00:31:32.518
Actually, some senpai said that they'd be watching too, but...

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:36.689
No pressure, right?

00:31:36.729 --> 00:31:37.810
That's a lot of pressure.

00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:43.794
Usually, we don't really practice for a karaoke, but this time, yes.

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:44.254
Yes.

00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:44.654
Yes.

00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:44.995
Yes.

00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:45.875
Yes.

00:31:45.895 --> 00:31:46.295
Practice.

00:31:46.516 --> 00:31:47.076
We'll do our best.

00:31:47.256 --> 00:31:49.037
But more than anything, have fun.

00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:49.738
Fun.

00:31:49.878 --> 00:31:50.378
Fun.

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:55.581
We'll also be appearing on Kyoto Senpai's Holotalk earlier that day.

00:31:56.282 --> 00:31:59.564
And this is going to be our first collab with Senpai.

00:32:01.005 --> 00:32:02.826
I guess all of Abyss will be there too, but

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:10.862
We'll also be playing Sakura Wars 5 for the first time on Sunday, but we have a good question.

00:32:10.902 --> 00:32:15.164
We have the choice of playing it with the Japanese dub or the English dub.

00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:28.250
Japanese dub or English dub?

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:28.870
JP dub!

00:32:42.423 --> 00:32:43.985
Maybe we'll make a poll on Twitter, too.

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:46.807
On Twitter, maybe YouTube, too.

00:32:46.827 --> 00:32:48.869
And then we can figure it all together.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.310
JP Dub.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.572
I see a lot of JP Dub.

00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.394
Just to make sure, we'll make one on Twitter, okay?

00:32:54.414 --> 00:32:55.075
Just one.

00:32:55.215 --> 00:32:56.997
In my inside, I prefer English.

00:32:57.217 --> 00:33:00.620
Well, you know, there's some Ruffians that like to listen along.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.821
Yeah, right.

00:33:01.841 --> 00:33:03.303
While you're working, or...

00:33:03.983 --> 00:33:04.524
I'm excited.

00:33:04.544 --> 00:33:06.827
There's so much to look forward to.

00:33:23.252 --> 00:33:32.061
And for FUWAMOCO Morning today, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruviewers today.

00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:33.383
Ruviewers?

00:33:33.443 --> 00:33:34.083
Ruviewers?

00:33:34.203 --> 00:33:36.165
Ruviewers!

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:38.828
Cuppy Dog City!

00:33:38.968 --> 00:33:39.469
BAU BAU!

00:33:39.489 --> 00:33:41.050
We hope you enjoyed your breakfast!

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.671
BAU BAU!

00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:42.472
ZigZag!

00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:42.952
ZigZag!

00:33:43.012 --> 00:33:44.534
BAU BAU!

00:33:44.874 --> 00:33:45.495
Moomba!

00:33:45.575 --> 00:33:46.216
BAU BAU!

00:33:47.016 --> 00:33:56.802
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:33:56.862 --> 00:33:58.743
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
