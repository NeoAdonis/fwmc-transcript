05:09.800 --> 05:11.990
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:12.440 --> 05:15.890
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.100 --> 05:19.528
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:19.629 --> 05:21.509
BAU BAU!

05:21.529 --> 05:25.450
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.631
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.931 --> 05:31.632
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:31.712 --> 05:32.812
BAU BAU!

05:33.433 --> 05:39.258
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.498 --> 05:40.239
Ruffians!

05:42.621 --> 05:44.983
It's episode 96 today!

05:48.326 --> 05:48.967
BAU BAU.

05:52.455 --> 05:58.001
It's not just episode 96, it's also the end of the week already!

05:58.082 --> 05:58.382
Weekend!

05:58.422 --> 06:00.464
BAU BAU!

06:00.564 --> 06:05.510
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:06.311 --> 06:09.014
The 96th episode right before the weekend!

06:09.034 --> 06:09.795
BAU BAU!

06:13.447 --> 06:14.768
I see some new Ruffians.

06:15.768 --> 06:16.549
Ruffians!

06:16.669 --> 06:27.475
For those of you that are just joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:27.715 --> 06:28.256
A.K.A.

06:28.276 --> 06:29.256
FUWAMOCO!

06:29.636 --> 06:32.958
And it's hosted by the Ruffians!

06:34.079 --> 06:34.319
No.

06:34.639 --> 06:35.500
Shiori. No.

06:36.627 --> 06:40.249
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:40.429 --> 06:41.710
BAU BAU!

06:42.510 --> 06:48.533
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:48.673 --> 06:53.836
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

06:54.036 --> 06:57.878
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:58.338 --> 07:00.779
BAU BAU!

07:01.500 --> 07:03.621
This is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:05.274 --> 07:07.016
BAU BAU!

07:07.637 --> 07:11.661
I wonder if we'll have any new new Ruffians on FUWAMOCO Morning 100.

07:11.782 --> 07:14.685
That would be nice.

07:15.285 --> 07:16.927
Well, Moco-chan!

07:16.987 --> 07:20.912
Let's start off today with another FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:21.092 --> 07:23.294
What do we have today?

07:29.171 --> 07:30.051
De-den!

07:30.471 --> 07:35.755
Did you decide to organize some dogs yourself after my stream the other day?

07:40.779 --> 07:43.640
Is this one of the dogs you unlocked?

07:46.122 --> 07:49.885
Pero... Moco-chan, is this a Pero Sighting?

07:58.526 --> 08:01.768
Wait, what's with the description of Jun?

08:04.349 --> 08:05.450
Cute ball of love.

08:06.730 --> 08:07.671
Intelligent!

08:08.991 --> 08:10.072
Oh my son!

08:11.193 --> 08:13.794
No, this is Pero, you know?

08:17.056 --> 08:18.056
I don't know.

08:18.836 --> 08:22.058
I don't think he's a good dog to organize Ruffians.

08:23.039 --> 08:23.359
You know?

08:24.864 --> 08:27.584
Pero and a group of a bunch of dogs.

08:28.345 --> 08:30.585
I don't think he's gonna get along with them.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.966
Especially not Garibaldi.

08:34.626 --> 08:35.026
No.

08:35.106 --> 08:35.346
No.

08:36.006 --> 08:37.846
Plus, Pero's round.

08:38.146 --> 08:39.166
Very round.

08:39.527 --> 08:41.087
I think you know it.

08:41.407 --> 08:48.148
If you try to organize him along with all those other dogs, they might start to go missing.

08:49.908 --> 08:53.649
But, I guess that's a way to clean and organize too.

08:54.892 --> 08:57.053
Get rid of the competition.

08:57.793 --> 08:58.433
BAU BAU.

09:00.214 --> 09:04.555
Organizing dogs just got darker, Ruffians.

09:05.856 --> 09:06.776
BAU BAU.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.597
Well, I hope you had some fun.

09:11.477 --> 09:12.658
Yeah?

09:13.038 --> 09:20.180
I would recommend though that you run an update on your game because I think something is... Something is broken!

09:20.560 --> 09:22.161
Yeah, this may be.

09:23.154 --> 09:25.195
BAU BAU!

09:25.215 --> 09:25.755
BAU BAU!

09:25.815 --> 09:26.955
BAU BAU!

09:26.975 --> 09:27.776
BAU BAU!

09:27.836 --> 09:28.936
BAU BAU!

09:29.596 --> 09:30.517
BAU BAU!

09:30.577 --> 09:31.737
BAU BAU!

09:47.423 --> 10:01.192
We're going to be part of the hololive meet Super Karaoke Party together with some of our amazing senpai right there.

10:01.312 --> 10:04.234
We're going to be singing a bunch of songs.

10:04.254 --> 10:08.056
Some J-pop maybe, some anime songs maybe.

10:10.157 --> 10:17.728
Before that, actually, we'll be meeting some very lucky Ruffians for the first time in two whole weeks!

10:19.383 --> 10:23.047
Where are we?

10:23.868 --> 10:26.830
We're super excited!

10:27.531 --> 10:30.574
But also really nervous.

10:30.594 --> 10:35.459
But we're gonna sing our hearts out!

10:35.819 --> 10:38.002
But, uh, Moco-chan.

10:38.242 --> 10:39.884
Ruffians, look at this!

10:41.659 --> 10:43.300
De-den!

10:43.340 --> 10:47.503
We've been on adjuncts going around Taipei!

10:47.563 --> 10:54.387
You can hear us BAU BAUing from the streets of Abyss!

10:55.568 --> 10:57.269
That's so cool, right?

10:57.329 --> 10:57.890
Right!

10:57.910 --> 11:00.832
I hope we haven't been too loud.

11:01.392 --> 11:04.534
Really disturbed some grandmas and grandpas.

11:04.734 --> 11:05.935
Yeah, but...

11:06.687 --> 11:12.107
You know, it would be cute if they both BAU'd along with us, right?

11:12.188 --> 11:12.549
Right!

11:13.294 --> 11:14.735
Yeah, but Ruffians!

11:15.215 --> 11:19.478
That's absolutely what we need you to do at the concert, okay?

11:19.958 --> 11:23.860
Yeah, we hope we can hear your voice lots and lots, okay?

11:24.621 --> 11:25.882
And FUWAMOCO!

11:26.142 --> 11:32.966
We're going to do our best and hopefully the BAU BAU BYOU will get even stronger in Taipei!

11:34.187 --> 11:36.308
BAU BAU!

11:36.548 --> 11:37.449
Exciting!

11:39.250 --> 11:40.871
Never BAU BAU too loud, no.

11:41.691 --> 11:43.852
BAU BAU lots okay!

11:43.872 --> 11:46.374
We'll be watching!

11:46.594 --> 11:47.494
Waiting!

11:47.915 --> 11:48.875
Listening!

11:48.935 --> 11:49.595
All this stuff!

11:50.336 --> 11:50.916
BAU BAU!

11:54.414 --> 11:59.477
Well, there's been some other news with our whole Iain-senpai team.

11:59.497 --> 12:03.859
You might not have heard, Ruffians, but Calli-senpai!

12:04.360 --> 12:11.004
Calli-senpai just recently went away for surgery.

12:11.544 --> 12:14.066
But she was really worried about it.

12:14.206 --> 12:14.706
Understandably!

12:17.193 --> 12:17.974
It all went well.

12:17.994 --> 12:19.314
Yeah!

12:19.935 --> 12:22.356
We were thinking about her lots and lots.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.559
I know, we were sure she was really stressed about it.

12:25.859 --> 12:31.202
And she even said that on Twitter she was so worried that she couldn't sleep at all before.

12:31.242 --> 12:31.523
Yeah.

12:32.223 --> 12:34.164
You know, we've been lucky ourselves.

12:34.184 --> 12:36.346
We've never needed surgery before.

12:36.426 --> 12:41.249
And hopefully it stays that way for us and all the Ruffians watching us today too!

12:41.309 --> 12:41.849
Yeah!

12:42.950 --> 12:44.030
It's scary.

12:44.430 --> 12:50.252
But, you know, we hope that she heals up super duper fast and that she has a quick recovery.

12:50.292 --> 12:50.492
Yeah!

12:50.532 --> 12:51.352
We know she will!

12:51.372 --> 12:52.193
Yeah!

12:52.613 --> 12:58.935
And, well, we know it might be a little bit of a while before she's back, so eat her slice like normal.

12:59.035 --> 13:00.035
It makes sense.

13:00.055 --> 13:00.235
Yeah.

13:00.535 --> 13:03.098
You need to take a break in these times you know.

13:03.118 --> 13:08.885
We're sending you all our energy and fluffy and fuzzy vibes coming senpai!

13:08.945 --> 13:11.728
BAU BAU!

13:11.808 --> 13:15.252
Get better soon senpai!

13:15.272 --> 13:16.614
BAU BAU!

13:18.696 --> 13:20.858
Yeah, those times you need to take a break.

13:20.978 --> 13:22.019
You better take a break.

13:22.219 --> 13:22.479
Yeah.

13:22.639 --> 13:24.821
Yeah, or FUWAMOCO are gonna find you.

13:24.841 --> 13:26.222
She's doing well!

13:26.242 --> 13:27.303
She looks good!

13:27.403 --> 13:27.863
Right?

13:27.923 --> 13:28.624
She looks good.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.385
A beautiful photo.

13:30.865 --> 13:32.347
I wanna take a photo like that.

13:32.467 --> 13:32.787
No!

13:32.807 --> 13:33.948
No, the thumbs up.

13:33.988 --> 13:35.069
Thumbs up photo?

13:35.129 --> 13:36.430
The thumbs up photo.

13:36.510 --> 13:37.811
I don't have a thumbs up photo.

13:39.124 --> 13:40.164
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:40.284 --> 13:43.285
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

13:43.765 --> 13:44.065
BAU BAU!

13:56.889 --> 14:04.013
But that goal is reaching 1 million subscribers before our first anniversary!

14:04.613 --> 14:05.533
You know that, right?

14:05.553 --> 14:06.174
Right.

14:06.214 --> 14:06.834
Yeah!

14:07.394 --> 14:09.895
We've been working hard to try to reach that goal!

14:10.116 --> 14:11.916
Yeah.

14:12.557 --> 14:13.457
Yeah.

14:13.677 --> 14:21.981
Well, you might have noticed, especially during Fufu Week, that there's been some vertical streams, and that's a part of it too.

14:22.001 --> 14:22.582
Yeah.

14:23.832 --> 14:26.814
Right now, the official countdown.

14:27.214 --> 14:31.757
We're 82 days away from our first year anniversary.

14:32.158 --> 14:39.543
And right now, as you can see, Ruffians, we're at 831,000 Ruffians.

14:40.203 --> 14:42.125
That's crazy amount of Ruffians!

14:42.645 --> 14:43.105
Right!

14:43.125 --> 14:44.926
Oh my gosh.

14:44.987 --> 14:48.149
But you know, some Ruffians, it's the math.

14:49.261 --> 14:52.382
You know, it is looking a little tricky.

14:52.462 --> 14:53.523
A little tricky.

14:53.703 --> 14:54.883
But we won't give up though!

14:55.043 --> 14:55.124
No!

14:55.204 --> 14:59.465
Yeah, we'll keep on working hard to meet the goal!

14:59.525 --> 14:59.806
Yes!

14:59.886 --> 15:04.347
But the number one thing to remember is that it's not about the journey.

15:04.708 --> 15:04.828
What?

15:04.848 --> 15:06.328
It's not about the goal!

15:06.628 --> 15:08.109
It's about the journey!

15:08.669 --> 15:08.929
Yes!

15:11.451 --> 15:13.332
It's still early morning.

15:13.352 --> 15:16.875
Don't open it!

15:16.955 --> 15:18.396
It's about to dirty!

15:23.547 --> 15:26.788
We are not misunderstanding Ruffians!

15:26.868 --> 15:27.529
We are!

15:27.709 --> 15:30.890
We can't have multiple- And so!

15:31.210 --> 15:34.812
We're gonna continue to do our best no matter what!

15:34.992 --> 15:35.192
Yes!

15:35.312 --> 15:40.274
And you know, we're gonna continue to let everybody know that this is our big dream right now.

15:40.294 --> 15:40.714
Yeah.

15:40.974 --> 15:46.356
Because you know, if you have something important that you want to achieve, you need to say it.

15:46.416 --> 15:46.697
Yeah.

15:47.117 --> 15:47.837
Be proud!

15:47.997 --> 15:48.257
Yeah.

15:48.417 --> 15:51.458
Even if others say, you know, that's a silly dream.

15:51.478 --> 15:51.539
Hai.

15:51.899 --> 15:52.319
Yeah.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.621
Nerissa, it's your dream.

15:54.641 --> 15:56.442
We're gonna do it!

15:56.462 --> 15:58.885
We're gonna reach this!

15:59.005 --> 16:00.947
The FUWAMOCO way!

16:02.904 --> 16:08.847
So hopefully, maybe Ruffians, we can give you a little bit of courage too to reach for your dreams!

16:08.907 --> 16:11.209
To put your dreams into work.

16:11.649 --> 16:19.713
And maybe not being so scared of making yourself a little bit vulnerable if it means that you can accomplish something very important to you.

16:20.073 --> 16:21.995
If it matters to you, it's important.

16:23.055 --> 16:26.436
Let's reach for our dreams together, okay?

16:26.696 --> 16:29.917
Please support us on our journey to one million, okay?

16:30.397 --> 16:33.258
BAU BAU!

16:33.698 --> 16:34.438
It's important.

16:34.899 --> 16:35.599
The journey.

16:35.919 --> 16:38.200
The highway or the FUWAMOCO way.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.920
The journey, right!

16:40.160 --> 16:40.520
Yeah.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.461
Your dream is to live peacefully.

16:43.801 --> 16:46.382
Then let's have a peaceful, happy life.

16:46.702 --> 16:47.802
BAU BAU!

16:53.411 --> 16:55.733
I said it'd be nice to be peaceful.

16:56.454 --> 16:58.215
But, Ruffians!

17:01.658 --> 17:03.459
You noticed something, right?

17:04.019 --> 17:07.162
This week has been a bit different compared to last, right?

17:07.602 --> 17:07.982
Right!

17:09.383 --> 17:09.864
Yeah!

17:10.384 --> 17:11.425
It's been fluffy week!

17:12.325 --> 17:13.046
Fluffy week!

17:13.226 --> 17:13.807
My week!

17:14.207 --> 17:18.510
Because Moco-chan, well, you've been doing your best to rest up your barker, right?

17:19.091 --> 17:20.652
How's it been going, Moco-chan?

17:23.151 --> 17:23.912
I've been trying.

17:24.473 --> 17:25.995
I've been trying.

17:26.095 --> 17:26.897
What do you think?

17:27.077 --> 17:29.601
The parker's owning a little bed of Ruffians.

17:34.599 --> 17:35.739
I think so.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.220
Yeah.

17:37.580 --> 17:38.140
Trying.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.221
Wow.

17:41.821 --> 17:43.341
I'm really glad, Moco-chan.

17:43.481 --> 17:47.602
Just make sure you keep resting lots and lots, okay?

17:47.902 --> 17:50.003
I'm trying to rest but also be helpful.

17:50.183 --> 17:50.303
Yeah.

17:50.323 --> 17:52.844
Moco-chan, you're very helpful too.

17:53.204 --> 17:54.004
But, uh...

17:54.864 --> 17:58.429
Ruffians, there's one thing that I realized.

17:58.449 --> 18:00.211
Like, in particular!

18:01.393 --> 18:02.554
In particular.

18:02.575 --> 18:09.203
There's a lot of things, but I have a big issue without you here with me, Moco-chan.

18:09.464 --> 18:09.804
Really.

18:10.085 --> 18:12.428
Yeah, other than the obvious things like, uh...

18:13.024 --> 18:14.906
Now I have to play the game.

18:15.646 --> 18:16.147
What?

18:16.907 --> 18:20.130
I have to hold the controller, maybe sometimes- That's an issue!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.212
It's a big controller.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.973
My paws get tired.

18:24.994 --> 18:28.257
My paws are not big!

18:28.637 --> 18:33.741
Well, Ruffians, you know, Fuwawa, I'm not so good at left and right.

18:34.262 --> 18:34.562
Right?

18:36.163 --> 18:40.627
And then when it comes to clocks, sometimes that's a bit tricky too, right?

18:43.593 --> 18:53.717
And, well, apparently, if it's just me all on my own, I also have a really hard time keeping track of time.

18:53.778 --> 19:00.180
Somehow, I ended up playing Hitman for over 5 hours yesterday.

19:06.957 --> 19:08.979
You know I gotta be carried away, huh?

19:09.540 --> 19:10.962
I was gonna tell Fuwawa.

19:11.262 --> 19:14.546
Remember, it's okay to play a bit longer today.

19:17.884 --> 19:19.905
I knew it was a good thing I didn't say that.

19:20.045 --> 19:20.645
Why?

19:20.945 --> 19:22.606
You wouldn't play for 7 hours if I told you that.

19:22.726 --> 19:23.887
I would have!

19:24.327 --> 19:25.568
I would have!

19:26.068 --> 19:26.828
Water bottle.

19:26.848 --> 19:29.529
It's FUWAMOCO Morning, you're not the host today.

19:29.830 --> 19:30.090
Yes!

19:30.430 --> 19:30.550
Hi.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.411
So yeah, I got a bit carried away.

19:33.431 --> 19:36.513
It was, you know, it was my first time playing Hitman.

19:36.933 --> 19:39.854
And there was just so much to explore and try out.

19:40.354 --> 19:43.296
So, I lost myself a little bit.

19:44.907 --> 19:45.768
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:45.828 --> 19:46.589
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:46.689 --> 19:48.050
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:48.450 --> 19:50.171
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:50.252 --> 19:51.913
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:51.933 --> 19:52.794
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:52.814 --> 19:53.634
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:53.714 --> 19:54.295
FUWAMOCO Morning!

20:13.752 --> 20:14.232
Yeah.

20:14.612 --> 20:16.312
But it was amazing, right?

20:16.913 --> 20:17.413
Yeah.

20:17.973 --> 20:22.213
I really didn't think it would work, but it did.

20:22.794 --> 20:23.394
It did.

20:24.114 --> 20:24.894
Had to check it out.

20:24.934 --> 20:26.114
Okay, Ruffians?

20:26.294 --> 20:26.954
Hi!

20:26.974 --> 20:32.615
Yeah, you really never ever know what Agent 437's gonna be up to, huh?

20:32.695 --> 20:32.995
Hi.

20:34.536 --> 20:35.896
It was a lot of fun.

20:36.256 --> 20:39.516
Thank you, Ruffians, for the game suggestion too.

20:39.896 --> 20:42.677
Hopefully one day we can play again together, Moco-chan.

20:43.766 --> 20:45.026
You think I'd be good at it?

20:45.206 --> 20:45.566
Agent 47.

20:45.606 --> 20:45.566
47!

20:46.027 --> 20:50.208
I don't know if I'd be good at it.

20:51.428 --> 20:52.648
BAU BAU!

20:52.668 --> 20:55.469
BAU BAU!

20:55.509 --> 20:56.329
Not on the list.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.750
Not on the list anymore.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.270
Why?

20:58.490 --> 20:58.850
Yeah.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.470
I'm here.

21:00.950 --> 21:01.451
Yeah.

21:02.291 --> 21:03.391
BAU BAU!

21:03.631 --> 21:04.591
Ruffians!

21:08.373 --> 21:09.775
You might have noticed.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.559
The other day while I was streaming.

21:15.341 --> 21:16.862
I came in with a concern.

21:19.305 --> 21:19.785
You know.

21:21.207 --> 21:24.310
It's surprising.

21:25.331 --> 21:27.033
We are Ruffians.

21:29.617 --> 21:40.842
I was really scared, but you know, it's concerning when your little sister barges in, you know, when you're playing Touhou and focusing and just says, I made a mistake.

21:41.522 --> 21:42.083
Right?

21:43.483 --> 21:43.843
Yeah.

21:44.564 --> 21:55.669
Well, you know, what I was trying to do was heat up my leftover noodles that I couldn't eat earlier.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.501
You know, I know that you're supposed to pour hot water in them.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.182
That's how we make them normally.

22:03.442 --> 22:04.723
I read the instructions.

22:05.063 --> 22:07.644
Especially, you know, it's new.

22:07.664 --> 22:10.725
Instructions are important.

22:12.005 --> 22:15.947
What are you supposed to do if you don't finish them all?

22:18.708 --> 22:19.308
Anyways!

22:19.768 --> 22:21.008
I tried heating them up.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.269
So I put them in for a minute.

22:24.590 --> 22:25.290
And then I walked away.

22:27.893 --> 22:29.534
That's where my mistake was, huh?

22:29.574 --> 22:29.734
Yeah.

22:29.754 --> 22:31.974
Huh.

22:33.295 --> 22:34.355
Yeah.

22:34.435 --> 22:35.596
I came back to the cup!

22:36.336 --> 22:39.257
And it looked like a big bubbly enemy from Hokuto no Ken!

22:40.277 --> 22:42.658
You're already dead.

22:42.778 --> 22:43.058
No!

22:43.078 --> 22:45.559
My noodles are already dead!

22:45.939 --> 22:47.879
The noodles were already dead!

22:50.220 --> 22:51.321
It was really not good.

22:52.121 --> 22:52.361
Yeah.

22:53.161 --> 22:54.862
I wasn't expecting it at all!

22:55.322 --> 22:55.522
Yeah.

22:57.438 --> 23:00.600
Luckily though, it didn't explode everywhere or anything.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.941
I just left it there.

23:02.862 --> 23:03.443
Cooled down.

23:04.764 --> 23:05.764
And then I tossed it.

23:05.784 --> 23:08.046
Yeah, I didn't have to do anything.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.429
I felt bad about throwing it out.

23:12.570 --> 23:13.831
It's not good, Moco-chan.

23:14.471 --> 23:15.392
It was a mistake.

23:15.932 --> 23:20.135
But it's okay because you know, new foods are tricky, right?

23:20.676 --> 23:22.777
What are you supposed to do, Ruffians?

23:22.857 --> 23:23.098
Hi!

23:26.496 --> 23:28.017
Did you just eat them whole then?

23:28.037 --> 23:31.400
I guess that's your punishment for not eating them all right away.

23:32.781 --> 23:36.404
Yahoo.

23:36.444 --> 23:38.185
What if you don't have a bowl, hai?

23:38.285 --> 23:40.527
Put it in a bowl, that's the solution.

23:40.567 --> 23:43.509
What if you don't have a bowl still?

23:46.051 --> 23:47.072
Hai!

23:47.772 --> 23:49.573
What if you only have two mugs?

23:50.094 --> 23:50.454
Hai!

23:50.474 --> 23:52.276
Put it in the mugs, Moco-chan!

23:52.376 --> 23:53.997
It's gonna be a big mug!

23:57.042 --> 23:57.942
BAU BAU!

23:57.982 --> 23:59.223
BAU BAU!

23:59.243 --> 24:00.803
BAU BAU!

24:03.044 --> 24:03.944
BAU BAU!

24:34.055 --> 24:37.616
But... There's been a misunderstanding.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.238
Another misunderstanding.

24:42.158 --> 24:44.359
We've been doing good, you know?

24:45.600 --> 24:47.881
This one, Ruffians!

24:48.981 --> 24:56.625
It's really embarrassing, so... I was just hoping, you know, that you'd forget about it!

24:57.285 --> 24:57.505
But...

25:00.407 --> 25:08.413
I keep on seeing very upset Ruffians on Twitter, so I thought I better address this.

25:09.734 --> 25:15.538
I better apologize for this.

25:16.278 --> 25:20.101
Finally, after a few weeks, Ruffians.

25:22.842 --> 25:28.766
You know, we had a special FUWAMOCO Morning together with Koyori-senpai, right?

25:30.638 --> 25:38.380
And, uh, she was talking about a yobai party and buying pajamas for us in the future.

25:39.041 --> 25:41.461
Just special for the party!

25:41.481 --> 25:51.724
And, uh, she said she was going to get sexy pajamas for me, for Fuwawa!

25:52.025 --> 25:56.466
And I got all flustered and she's... And I...

25:57.538 --> 26:01.541
I said, I'm not sexy, I'm Fuwawa!

26:02.261 --> 26:07.004
And, uh, it seems that that might have made some Ruffians very angry.

26:10.186 --> 26:15.869
But, uh, well, BAU BAU?

26:17.530 --> 26:19.111
I'm just Fuwawa.

26:20.672 --> 26:21.052
I guess.

26:23.154 --> 26:26.916
If you think that's true, then, well,

26:28.370 --> 26:37.673
It's rude of me to make statements like that, so... I'll try not to say things like that in the future, okay?

26:37.693 --> 26:41.035
I won't say things that'll make you upset, okay?

27:02.141 --> 27:02.741
BAU BAU!

27:04.143 --> 27:04.924
BAU BAU!

27:06.306 --> 27:08.949
BAU BAU!

27:11.252 --> 27:13.434
Well, let's forget about that!

27:13.935 --> 27:14.335
Right!

27:14.796 --> 27:18.440
And let's take a look at the cutest Doggie of the Day today, my Moco-chan!

27:18.460 --> 27:18.841
Right!

27:24.211 --> 27:28.795
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

27:28.835 --> 27:29.916
Sky!

27:30.257 --> 27:30.757
Sky!

27:30.877 --> 27:33.399
BAU BAU!

27:33.480 --> 27:34.560
So cute!

27:34.641 --> 27:36.883
Look at the tongue!

27:37.043 --> 27:38.104
Beautiful color!

27:38.124 --> 27:41.467
I really want to touch the tongue.

27:41.947 --> 27:43.508
Don't touch the tongue though, no.

27:43.749 --> 27:44.670
But look, Sky!

27:44.990 --> 27:47.012
Sky has the same fur color as us!

27:51.735 --> 27:52.956
Is that because of Sky?

27:52.996 --> 27:55.217
Did Sky make you sneeze, Moco-chan?

27:58.159 --> 27:59.540
Well, Sky!

27:59.840 --> 28:05.504
Sky's very curious and obedient, but a bit of a shy doggy too.

28:05.524 --> 28:06.224
Shy Sky.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.485
Yeah, Shy Sky.

28:07.505 --> 28:09.687
She likes to explore new places!

28:10.107 --> 28:15.250
And, uh, when she does, sometimes she comes back scared because there's new people too.

28:16.732 --> 28:17.993
It's understandable.

28:18.113 --> 28:22.879
I was thinking, Sky and Moco-chan have quite a bit in common, huh?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.361
How does Sky BAU BAU?

28:25.283 --> 28:26.845
I think it's... BAU BAU!

28:26.905 --> 28:27.666
BAU BAU!

28:34.281 --> 28:36.021
BAU BAU!

28:36.901 --> 28:38.362
BAU BAU!

28:38.382 --> 28:40.522
I think it's accurate.

28:40.702 --> 28:41.502
I think so.

28:42.542 --> 28:42.863
Yeah.

28:43.103 --> 28:46.543
BAU BAU!

28:46.903 --> 28:54.465
Just like Moco-chan, Sky is doing their best to be brave and learn as much as they can about the world around them.

28:54.485 --> 28:56.025
Just like me!

28:56.065 --> 28:57.965
Yeah, just like you in particular.

28:57.985 --> 28:59.585
I feel like... Hmm.

29:08.638 --> 29:11.080
And Sky's doing their best too.

29:11.640 --> 29:15.342
Please make sure that you hold her paw as she gets stronger, okay?

29:15.362 --> 29:17.444
Especially around new people.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.385
New people's always a bit rough, right, Moco-chan?

29:21.466 --> 29:22.547
That's what the sniffle is for.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.378
BAU BAU!

29:28.300 --> 29:30.161
And next!

29:30.362 --> 29:32.043
Today I went on a walk.

29:32.403 --> 29:33.184
Ruffians!

29:33.384 --> 29:35.146
Making sure to stretch those paws right.

29:35.186 --> 29:36.627
That's the point!

29:36.647 --> 29:38.569
Going out and seeing new things right.

29:38.829 --> 29:41.051
We have De-den!

29:41.531 --> 29:47.376
FUWAMOCO Abyssgard!

29:47.496 --> 29:48.777
Look at the colors!

29:49.558 --> 29:50.719
So beautiful.

29:51.701 --> 29:55.610
Wow, what an amazing way to start out your day!

30:02.413 --> 30:06.818
I hope you had a really great hike and that you got some good rest after it too.

30:06.958 --> 30:07.259
Nice!

30:07.679 --> 30:08.720
Rest in peace, okay?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.982
BAU BAU!

30:10.082 --> 30:11.564
BAU BAU!

30:11.664 --> 30:13.586
You eat so BAU-tiful.

30:13.626 --> 30:14.387
BAU-tiful.

30:14.407 --> 30:14.608
Yeah.

30:14.728 --> 30:15.769
BAU BAU!

30:16.430 --> 30:18.312
BAU BAU!

30:18.432 --> 30:20.074
I wanna go on a hike now too.

30:20.134 --> 30:21.236
That would be nice.

30:24.522 --> 30:27.043
Oh, we also got another question.

30:27.804 --> 30:31.205
The Question of the Day today is... De-den!

30:31.545 --> 30:33.326
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

30:33.686 --> 30:37.247
I think it's pretty safe to say that you both love music.

30:37.367 --> 30:38.287
Just a bit, hoi.

30:39.568 --> 30:42.109
But what's your favorite setting to listen to?

30:42.529 --> 30:43.429
During walks?

30:43.869 --> 30:45.070
While you do chores?

30:45.570 --> 30:51.212
Or are you even sitting down in a big armchair doing nothing else like a true connoisseur?

30:53.322 --> 30:54.103
FUWAMOCO!

30:54.403 --> 30:56.205
We can't live without music.

30:56.645 --> 30:56.805
No.

30:57.266 --> 30:58.367
Music is us!

30:58.527 --> 30:58.647
Yeah.

30:58.807 --> 30:58.967
Right.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.771
You know, we love listening to music a lot.

31:03.151 --> 31:04.833
But, I think you know.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.341
The best answer is that we're always listening to music.

31:09.461 --> 31:10.541
The wonderful seven.

31:10.821 --> 31:12.042
You know, while we sleep.

31:12.582 --> 31:13.222
While we eat.

31:14.143 --> 31:16.323
We just always have it running.

31:16.343 --> 31:29.108
I feel like when we don't have it, when it's like off, suddenly the world's just like a little bit more... Yeah, it just, it brightens up our days so much.

31:29.328 --> 31:32.209
Yeah, lots of energy from good tunes, you know?

31:32.229 --> 31:34.510
So we hope, Ruffians, that

31:34.963 --> 31:40.490
Maybe our music will make you feel the same way one day in the future.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.153
But I don't know.

31:43.054 --> 31:45.838
When we're like, we sit down and listen to it.

31:45.898 --> 31:49.102
We don't just sit down and just do just that.

31:49.843 --> 31:50.704
Think about things.

31:51.305 --> 31:52.707
Does it count if you dance?

31:55.595 --> 32:00.357
Is that the same as sitting down in an armchair and doing nothing while listening to music?

32:00.457 --> 32:07.240
When we're doing our signatures on our postcards for you Ruffians, we're listening and singing to music too!

32:08.201 --> 32:09.982
The music never stops.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.182
It doesn't stop!

32:12.083 --> 32:14.104
BAU BAU!

32:14.544 --> 32:20.306
While I've let the Ruffians sit in a big armchair like a true connoisseur and listen to our covers.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.167
Lifetime Showtime!

32:24.529 --> 32:26.470
Do it okay, Ruffians!

32:26.930 --> 32:28.812
BAU BAU!

32:28.852 --> 32:32.975
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions this week.

32:33.355 --> 32:37.838
For your questions, your doggies, pero sightings even.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.120
And your logs too!

32:41.301 --> 32:43.382
As well as the FUWAMOCO's groups.

32:44.143 --> 32:49.927
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning's a very, very special show that we made together, Ruffians.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.023
Please continue to use the hashtag.

32:54.103 --> 32:57.786
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

32:57.966 --> 32:59.868
BAU BAU!

33:00.088 --> 33:01.589
Thank you, Ruffians.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.752
And next, we have some streams coming up.

33:04.772 --> 33:06.213
Moco-chan, what's the next stream?

33:06.233 --> 33:07.214
The next stream is...

33:07.914 --> 33:08.715
Day!

33:08.975 --> 33:17.044
Well, before this we're gonna be live in Taipei, so we're gonna do our best, but the singing doesn't stop because FUWAMOCO!

33:17.445 --> 33:21.569
I'm having my first solo rock n' rawr party!

33:21.589 --> 33:22.150
BAU BAU!

33:25.473 --> 33:26.435
I'm really nervous.

33:26.515 --> 33:28.238
I'm going to be all on my own.

33:28.398 --> 33:29.640
It'll be fine.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.522
You'll be good.

33:30.542 --> 33:34.489
But I'm going to sing a bunch of my favorite songs.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.712
This time without Moco-chan.

33:36.812 --> 33:38.475
So maybe it'll be a little bit different.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.009
I'll be different.

33:40.089 --> 33:42.130
I'm looking forward to singing with you more.

33:42.170 --> 33:43.291
That's you, Moco-chan.

33:43.371 --> 33:44.672
I want to!

33:44.712 --> 33:49.534
But this time, it's my solo Rock n' Rawr Party song.

33:49.914 --> 33:51.735
I hope you'll be there, okay?

33:52.295 --> 33:53.316
BAU BAU!

33:53.376 --> 33:54.977
BAU BAU!

33:55.297 --> 33:56.838
And today, Ruffians.

33:57.198 --> 34:00.759
For Ruffians who are joining us later during the archive.

34:00.839 --> 34:01.740
Oh, a schedule.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.961
Oh, a schedule.

34:03.001 --> 34:03.501
I forgot.

34:04.081 --> 34:07.643
Because, well, after my Rock n' Rawr Party,

34:08.539 --> 34:10.700
FUWAMOCO we have a homework day!

34:11.041 --> 34:14.583
We're doing our best!

34:14.803 --> 34:19.666
Ruffians, maybe you can catch up on some of the fluffy week that you might have missed.

34:20.166 --> 34:22.928
And FUWAMOCO will catch up on some of the homework.

34:24.109 --> 34:25.590
That is always true.

34:25.870 --> 34:26.810
Yeah, we didn't miss.

34:28.912 --> 34:29.992
It just needs to get done.

34:31.949 --> 34:32.989
BAU BAU!

34:33.970 --> 34:40.511
