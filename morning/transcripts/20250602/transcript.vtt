00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:02.689
Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:09.763
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.890
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.261
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:18.702
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:24.416
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:28.260
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.083
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:33.025
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:39.712
And today we're your hosts on FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:40.393
Thank you!

00:05:40.413 --> 00:05:46.900
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for our 162nd episode!

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.081
I knew it would happen.

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:51.124
I knew something would get mistaken today.

00:05:51.144 --> 00:05:57.349
I was just thinking about how happy I was to be able to spend the morning together with the Ruffians.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.253
And then you go ahead of yourself.

00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:04.636
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.899
Put it here Ruffians!

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.045
I'm not waiting a new week and a new month because it's not June 2nd.

00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:16.887
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:26.100
Thank you Ruffians for being here together with us for the start of a new month and new FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:35.213
But for Ruffians that are joining us maybe for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show

00:06:35.193 --> 00:06:37.798
Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.722
A.K.A.

00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:40.143
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:42.948
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.960
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.345
So FUWAMOCO can try to balance their lives, yes!

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:58.554
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:58.574 --> 00:07:00.516
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:01.737
Hashtag!

00:07:03.038 --> 00:07:04.179
FWMCMORNING!

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.303
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:11.246
BAU BAU!

00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:13.708
You know, it's a new month.

00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:16.911
Things are maybe a little bit different for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:17.892 --> 00:07:19.473
But not.

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:20.134
June.

00:07:20.114 --> 00:07:21.143
Because it's June.

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:23.020
It's officially summer now.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.371
It's starting to get hot.

00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.953
Does that mean it's officially summer?

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:27.715
I think so, Moco-chan.

00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.737
May need to get a cold in spring.

00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:31.379
No more sweaters.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.460
Yeah.

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.103
No more hiding those arms, Moco-chan.

00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:43.412
But Ruffians, we also gotta make sure sunscreen, okay?

00:07:43.432 --> 00:07:43.512
Yes!

00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:44.333
Sunscreen!

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.335
And remember to hydrate, too.

00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:50.400
It's the morning, which means you definitely, definitely need to get some water.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.560
Yes!

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.943
Not just coffee, okay?

00:07:53.123 --> 00:07:53.243
Water!

00:07:53.223 --> 00:08:00.070
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:02.453
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:02.493 --> 00:08:07.579
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:11.062
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:12.384
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.470
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.872
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:22.490
I don't wanna share.

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:22.891
Huh?

00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:28.417
Don't wanna share.

00:08:28.437 --> 00:08:28.677
Got this.

00:08:28.697 --> 00:08:30.619
Pero, Pero, Pero Sighting.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.381
Ruffians think it's Pero.

00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:39.989
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.450
BAU BAU!

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.492
You wanna see where he is?

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:45.094
Let's see where Pero was Sighted this time.

00:08:45.134 --> 00:08:46.896
Okie!

00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:47.717
Okie.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:50.500
Dad!

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:56.937
Pero got an oshi?

00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:04.510
Is that oshi us?

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.375
Was he cheering for us?

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:11.578
Well, you know what?

00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:12.959
He's nasty!

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:18.265
And, uh, he does say a lot of things about Pero.

00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:23.291
You know, we do know him a lot better than you, Ruffian.

00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:23.551
I'm curious.

00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:31.400
But, if he's going to cheer for us like this, together with the Ruffians, maybe that's pretty nice of him.

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:32.401
Right.

00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:33.743
Right.

00:09:35.044 --> 00:09:37.187
Maybe we should treat him a little bit more kindly?

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.408
That's nice of him.

00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:45.060
Yeah, you know, if that's how he feels towards us, then... I guess.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.542
That's pretty nice.

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:47.283
Yeah.

00:09:47.604 --> 00:09:47.804
Yeah.

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:54.114
I mean, it'd be nice if he was cheering on any World Members too, but... But!

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:58.440
I think... Pero, you know, he needs to get his own happy life.

00:09:59.001 --> 00:10:01.125
He can't just steal yours, you know!

00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:07.855
But yeah... But... You know, everyone cheering for us is precious, so... Maybe...

00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:10.850
Now let's call Nasty.

00:10:13.454 --> 00:10:15.057
BAU BAU!

00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:16.259
BAU BAU!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.868
Are we happy about this?

00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:26.256
Mixed.

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:26.436
BAU BAU!

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:27.959
Please be careful, Ruffians.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.268
You want to make sure you keep a good eye on all your happy, your merch and everything.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:58.497
Good bye Metal Gear Solid!

00:10:58.477 --> 00:11:18.173
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:18.153 --> 00:11:22.559
But we finally reached the end of Metal Gear Solid 3!

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.303
And what a thrill it was!

00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:27.746
What a thrill, what an epic!

00:11:27.766 --> 00:11:31.090
You know, every game was so different!

00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:32.593
Very thrilling.

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:40.363
And I definitely mastered Stealth and QCQ.

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:46.822
It was a very FUWAMOCO, fluffy and fuzzy playthrough of all the games.

00:11:46.882 --> 00:11:52.435
So Ruffians, you know, maybe you haven't seen our playthrough of Metal Gear Solid.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:53.898
Metal Gear Solid 2.

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:57.627
Please take a look at Metal Gear Solid 3 too!

00:11:57.607 --> 00:12:00.731
Extra silly moments about the right.

00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:07.980
Moco-chan, the boss battle there, without any spoilers, was very interesting, right?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.443
Got pretty angry at points.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.325
So angry you became a horse?

00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:22.798
And we had you know, during the Metal Gear Solid series, we had some good things, you know, with our dance parties.

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:24.019
Dance.

00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:25.515
Vampire.

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:28.380
Vampire.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.902
You know conclusion of that.

00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:35.491
But we really really enjoyed it.

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:43.022
We enjoyed being able to show a game that's really special to you Ruffians and also maybe a first time for some Ruffians too.

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:49.332
But we know there's more Metal Gear Solid games but this is the end of the road for us for now.

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:53.819
Thank you Ruffians!

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:55.822
We had fun!

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:57.545
It was fun!

00:12:57.565 --> 00:12:58.146
BAU BAU!

00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:58.907
Good memories remain.

00:12:58.927 --> 00:13:00.971
It was your first time!

00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:02.313
BAU BAU!

00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:04.857
Both the first time though.

00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:05.899
BAU BAU!

00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:12.349
But you know, speaking first time, that's true!

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:13.891
A birthday coming up.

00:13:15.313 --> 00:13:24.583
It's gonna be Hajime's very first 3D birthday live!

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.486
Congratulations Hajime!

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:28.768
On the 7th at 8pm JST or 4am PT.

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:32.172
It's going to be Hajime's birthday!

00:13:32.192 --> 00:13:35.777
And the title of the concert is First Starring Role.

00:13:35.957 --> 00:13:37.759
I thought it was sort of funny.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.501
It's so cool.

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:40.674
It's so cool!

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:42.109
Why is the pony Moco-chan?

00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:43.180
I thought...

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:45.210
Wow, FUWAMOCO.

00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.795
I never think of such a cool title.

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:51.096
That is true.

00:13:51.276 --> 00:13:51.916
Right!

00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:54.379
And I actually think that there might be lots of dancing.

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:56.040
Wow, very cool.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.823
Right, you know, and this illustration too, Hajime.

00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:01.145
Hajime's, I think, done some stretching.

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:01.825
Yes!

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:03.567
It's ready to- I would hope!

00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:05.669
To show the results of those stretches.

00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:11.314
You know, and it looks like there's also gonna be a big announcement too.

00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:12.055
Oh, big announcement.

00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:12.475
Very cool.

00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:17.413
I wonder if they'll be guests too!

00:14:17.653 --> 00:14:19.917
We'll have to see!

00:14:19.937 --> 00:14:21.640
I'm looking forward to it though!

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.262
What kind of performances Hajime gonna show us?

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:24.684
And you know!

00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:25.666
Birthday girl!

00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:30.413
We gotta wish that birthday girl a big happy birthday too!

00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:31.656
Look at the time.

00:14:31.876 --> 00:14:33.499
I guess you could, you know.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.664
Or you could admire the deep stretching, you know.

00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:39.111
Or you could look at the face like a normal person.

00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:41.576
BAU BAU.

00:14:41.596 --> 00:14:43.119
I get lost in Hajime's eyes.

00:14:45.845 --> 00:14:49.031
But happy early birthday Hajime!

00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:51.777
BAU BAU!

00:14:52.162 --> 00:14:55.787
There's a lot of exciting things going on, you know.

00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:58.670
First day after 7th anniversary!

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.972
That's crazy!

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:04.197
Oh my gosh, hololive just keeps on, you know, growing!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.561
Not being miles, though.

00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:08.022
7 years?

00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:09.984
7 is a lot!

00:15:10.004 --> 00:15:11.326
7 is a lot!

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:14.710
I'm going on to a 3rd year hololive!

00:15:19.178 --> 00:15:22.001
BAU BAU!

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.723
BAU BAU!

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:35.152
Actually, there was an interesting observation that a Ruffian came across this, shared it with us.

00:15:35.172 --> 00:15:37.174
But, let's take a look at this.

00:15:39.936 --> 00:15:43.620
This is spotted at, I kinda guess a mall overseas.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.363
Looks kind of familiar.

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:51.409
Hmm.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:52.391
Kinda interesting.

00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:53.452
Kinda interesting.

00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:55.114
Is this a coincidence, maybe?

00:15:56.436 --> 00:15:58.579
Hmm.

00:15:58.599 --> 00:15:58.679
Hmm.

00:15:58.699 --> 00:15:58.959
Whoa.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.264
That's really, really similar, yeah.

00:16:02.804 --> 00:16:03.465
Similar.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.950
Why?

00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:09.533
Maybe they got inspiration.

00:16:09.974 --> 00:16:12.958
Maybe you know where the trendsetters and fashion!

00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:13.418
Trendsetters!

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.141
FUWAMOCO trendsetters!

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:16.843
Fashion trendsetters!

00:16:17.504 --> 00:16:19.847
You know, sometimes I see

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:28.469
FUWAMOCO Nails!

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.482
They're so cute!

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:47.961
Very cute, but you know, by setting the trends for what's in style, you know, the summer look is looking extra fluffy and fuzzy this year.

00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:49.484
Yeah, definitely summer.

00:16:49.964 --> 00:16:53.310
I definitely want to be very fluffy in summer, huh?

00:16:54.016 --> 00:16:55.358
Hi!

00:16:55.378 --> 00:17:00.124
Yeah, we're the trendsetters.

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:03.868
I'm so happy!

00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:04.108
Yeah!

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:07.252
I think it's a good choice and fashion.

00:17:07.272 --> 00:17:08.834
Yeah, if it's just a coincidence.

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:12.519
I'm happy that you know you look at the word.

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:12.999
That's FUWAMOCO!

00:17:15.022 --> 00:17:15.282
We're there!

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.385
We're there near the bar!

00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:21.610
Maybe you know, maybe you're like, oh, this store is near where I am.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.523
You can go get your own inspired FUWAMOCO code there too!

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:28.432
Lots of ideas!

00:17:28.452 --> 00:17:29.857
Perfect for this season!

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.131
BAU BAU!

00:17:34.672 --> 00:17:34.873
Thank you!

00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:38.295
So cool, so sweet.

00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:44.203
Well, next, you know, we've been talking about all the exciting things going on at hololive.

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:50.752
There was another exciting idea project just announced!

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:54.637
And it was announced by Botan-senpai!

00:17:55.258 --> 00:17:59.764
Because there's a new big big hololive

00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:03.291
Minecraft server about to happen!

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:06.977
The hololive Minecraft Gold Rush Survival!

00:18:07.058 --> 00:18:11.566
So we will explain what is happening.

00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:14.431
So it's gonna be happening in Minecraft!

00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:19.381
All together with hololive ID, IAN and JP!

00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:22.326
And the voice as well!

00:18:22.306 --> 00:18:23.868
I see Botan-senpai.

00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:26.531
She brought money to the world of Minecraft.

00:18:26.951 --> 00:18:29.634
And we're all gonna do within 5 days.

00:18:29.654 --> 00:18:33.358
We're going to try and make as much money as possible.

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:34.640
Yes, that is the goal.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.941
That is the goal.

00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:42.849
It's gonna be starting June 9th from 7pm to midnight JST.

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:45.732
Which is 3am.

00:18:45.712 --> 00:18:49.065
P.T.

00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:53.663
on the 9th and it's gonna end on the 13th!

00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:59.336
So, we have about five days to be able to get as much money as possible.

00:18:59.356 --> 00:19:00.557
But, how do we make money?

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.761
Right, well there's lots of different ways we can make money.

00:19:03.982 --> 00:19:05.183
Let's take a look.

00:19:05.864 --> 00:19:08.568
On the first day, we have a bunch of different jobs that we can choose.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.411
On the first day, we're gonna be jobless, I think.

00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:14.796
You know, so that we can kind of figure out what suits us best.

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:17.479
But from the second day, we'll be choosing classes.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.806
First, we have the Adventurer.

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:27.960
You know where you can make money by defeating monsters by fishing.

00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:32.293
You know Minecraft things.

00:19:32.313 --> 00:19:34.138
We like to fight monsters.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.487
Definitely FUWAMO likes it, the witches.

00:19:38.142 --> 00:19:40.747
I need to kill a witch!

00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:45.655
I also have a money man in the class.

00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:49.743
You can defeat the blocks, break the blocks, and get money that way.

00:19:49.763 --> 00:19:55.433
Apparently there's an attitude system too so that you can't just break a block, place a block, break a block, place a block.

00:19:55.453 --> 00:19:57.296
Oh, but I feel like that's fair, no?

00:19:57.657 --> 00:19:58.118
Really?

00:19:58.578 --> 00:19:58.979
Why not?

00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:01.163
You're doing the work.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.293
Go around and break the blocks.

00:20:04.313 --> 00:20:05.775
Not break place, break place.

00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:08.079
You know?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.621
Yeah.

00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:10.402
Not fair!

00:20:12.746 --> 00:20:15.830
I guess if you say so, Ruffians.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.255
And next we have the farm way.

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.058
The farm way, you know.

00:20:21.275 --> 00:20:28.891
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:29.633 --> 00:20:35.706
Have a howl of a day!

00:20:35.806 --> 00:20:41.157
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:41.862 --> 00:20:43.546
I don't know chickens apply for this.

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:45.690
I guess I did not, that's a farm.

00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:47.594
You need chickens on a farm.

00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:49.718
Are you just gonna have cows and pigs?

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.901
And sheep.

00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:53.847
And chicken.

00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:57.226
This is a job for everyone!

00:20:57.827 --> 00:20:57.907
Yes!

00:20:57.927 --> 00:21:00.992
And next we have the... Researcher!

00:21:01.012 --> 00:21:01.993
Researcher!

00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:11.308
You know you can make potions, do enchantments, repairs... I don't know if this is the FUWAMOCO type job class.

00:21:11.328 --> 00:21:13.972
I do not know how to make items well.

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:15.815
I don't know what's a potion.

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:18.720
I've never enchanted something and...

00:21:19.493 --> 00:21:20.535
I didn't know you could repair.

00:21:21.216 --> 00:21:23.461
But you can make money this way.

00:21:23.541 --> 00:21:25.625
I think this is not ours.

00:21:25.645 --> 00:21:30.875
And Botan-senpai is saying it comes really in handy near the end too.

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:33.160
Makes you think.

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:35.224
Yeah.

00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:38.856
But you know, it is a five day event.

00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:42.620
And maybe not all members can play every single day.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:48.727
So there's some other things that kind of maybe level things out, even things out.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:49.628
Yeah.

00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:51.470
But there's the arena!

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.513
So you can get all together and make a party!

00:21:54.553 --> 00:21:57.717
And then take down some very strong monsters!

00:21:57.737 --> 00:21:59.919
Apparently you cannot do it really on your own.

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:00.200
No.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.203
They're very strong.

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:07.419
Sally Botan-senpai said something about original monsters.

00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:11.664
We'll have to see!

00:22:14.347 --> 00:22:16.269
There's also LAMVIGUS!

00:22:16.289 --> 00:22:17.270
It's here!

00:22:17.491 --> 00:22:18.612
It's here!

00:22:18.632 --> 00:22:21.035
The whole Minecraft!

00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:22.937
There's Rush Survival Server.

00:22:23.277 --> 00:22:25.900
There's a roulette and also the slots.

00:22:26.361 --> 00:22:31.587
And so you can play them, you can get your tokens and then you can exchange them for money.

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:35.696
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:35.736 --> 00:22:39.904
Have a howl of a day!

00:22:40.165 --> 00:22:50.807
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.990
That's one way to make some extra money.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.751
Do you have anything else?

00:22:55.532 --> 00:22:58.395
We have the stock market!

00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:01.318
There'll be three different types of stocks that you can purchase.

00:23:01.638 --> 00:23:06.923
Butan-senpai is gonna be the game master, so every hour she's gonna spin a wheel.

00:23:06.943 --> 00:23:10.627
And I guess that determines if the stocks go up or if they go down.

00:23:11.268 --> 00:23:18.415
But she says generally, as long as you make sure to sell when they're high and buy when they're low, then it should go well for you.

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:19.702
As long as you remember that.

00:23:19.782 --> 00:23:20.666
Let's start.

00:23:20.687 --> 00:23:23.018
Sell high, buy low.

00:23:24.144 --> 00:23:25.772
Not buy high, sell low.

00:23:27.743 --> 00:23:37.518
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:37.558 --> 00:23:51.540
Have a howl of a day!

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.783
But I think that sounds fun, you know?

00:23:53.803 --> 00:23:56.067
Going on an adventure all together with everybody.

00:23:56.087 --> 00:23:58.711
Just to make sure you're first, maybe.

00:23:58.731 --> 00:23:59.452
Can you split it?

00:24:00.153 --> 00:24:01.455
Oh, good question.

00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.800
I don't know.

00:24:05.461 --> 00:24:09.287
There's also other events that will be happening on the different days.

00:24:09.307 --> 00:24:15.616
I don't think there's going to be an event happening on the first day, but throughout the event, there'll be different things we can do.

00:24:16.057 --> 00:24:18.220
An athletic test.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.764
Fishing eternally!

00:24:20.784 --> 00:24:22.407
Some mini-games!

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.571
And also snakes and lalas!

00:24:25.152 --> 00:24:30.782
This way we can also make some money, especially for other hololive members that might not be able to play everyday.

00:24:31.183 --> 00:24:36.552
This is a good way to kinda get a leg up, get some more money in your pocket, and get close to winning.

00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:40.479
Mini-games, mini-games!

00:24:40.499 --> 00:24:40.619
Right!

00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:41.220
So many things to do!

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:53.975
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:59.001
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:59.842 --> 00:25:03.647
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.189
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:05.209 --> 00:25:06.671
We're gonna be playing too!

00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:07.953
Yes!

00:25:08.894 --> 00:25:21.370
We're not very... We're still beginners at Minecraft, but we're really looking forward to doing our best trying to earn as much money as possible and playing together with our senpai too.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.453
How many days do you think you'll be participating for?

00:25:23.473 --> 00:25:24.534
That's a good question.

00:25:24.554 --> 00:25:26.256
I think most of them.

00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:30.522
We'd like to do most of them, but it's also kind of up in the air a little bit.

00:25:30.542 --> 00:25:33.145
The schedule, I don't know.

00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:34.106
What's going on tomorrow?

00:25:34.206 --> 00:25:36.910
I don't know.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.915
But it'll be lots of fun!

00:25:40.935 --> 00:25:45.260
Thank you so much Kabuta-senpai for organizing this, arranging this, and everything!

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.003
I'm really excited!

00:25:47.443 --> 00:25:51.568
So let's cheer on the event and enjoy it all together!

00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:53.631
BAU BAU!

00:25:53.611 --> 00:25:58.719
You know, it's been a while since the last big group event, right?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.021
At Minecraft!

00:26:00.763 --> 00:26:03.307
Exciting, you know, with the new server and everything.

00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:04.990
FUWAMOCO is super excited.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.455
We played the first day and then we got really busy and weren't able to play much more.

00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:18.792
So, we're excited to be able to have a very good opportunity to play together with everybody, so... BAU BAU!

00:26:19.447 --> 00:26:21.049
Ruffians!

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:22.351
Monday!

00:26:22.452 --> 00:26:24.615
New week, a new month.

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:25.877
You know what Monday means?

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.961
Excitement.

00:26:28.982 --> 00:26:29.643
It's Monday!

00:26:29.763 --> 00:26:30.704
Not blues, right?

00:26:30.744 --> 00:26:32.086
They say Monday blues.

00:26:34.129 --> 00:26:38.216
Which one is it for you, Ruffians?

00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:39.217
A new challenge.

00:26:40.118 --> 00:26:41.060
Nattou.

00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:45.066
Okay, Moco- No!

00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:58.633
You know, I was thinking that, especially with it being a new month and it may be getting a little bit hotter now, maybe Ruffians need a little bit more...pop in your day.

00:26:59.996 --> 00:27:04.204
Even though it's a Wednesday!

00:27:04.224 --> 00:27:09.535
Moco-chan, maybe have something to share with the Ruffians.

00:27:16.653 --> 00:27:17.875
Ruffians!

00:27:18.756 --> 00:27:25.748
It's a different day of the week so maybe it's a bit surprising but it's that time again!

00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.574
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:35.944
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:27:35.964 --> 00:27:36.105
Mococo!

00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:36.525
Ruffians!

00:27:37.427 --> 00:27:42.475
I know it's probably been a bit rough recently but

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:49.480
I know you keep on doing your best, even when you're tired and you feel like you're too exhausted to carry on.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:52.424
But you know what?

00:27:53.345 --> 00:27:54.867
You're doing it!

00:27:54.887 --> 00:27:56.249
You're doing so well!

00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:02.218
I know you're super strong, so why can't you see that yourself, silly?

00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:06.021
Even if you don't believe in yourself all the time.

00:28:06.622 --> 00:28:07.443
We do!

00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:09.988
FUWAMOCO believes in you!

00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:14.056
We're always cheering you on, so keep at it even when you stumble.

00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:15.058
Okay?

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.302
We're so proud!

00:28:17.943 --> 00:28:19.486
Ganbatte de!

00:28:19.566 --> 00:28:22.131
BAU BAU!

00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:24.853
BAU BAU!

00:28:25.173 --> 00:28:27.876
Keep on at it, okay?

00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:28.837
I love you!

00:28:28.857 --> 00:28:29.478
You got it!

00:28:29.818 --> 00:28:31.860
It'll be an amazing month, okay?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.581
Let's make it so.

00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:36.264
BAU BAU!

00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:39.007
It's that time again!

00:28:39.047 --> 00:28:43.071
It's the time for a Doggie of the Day!

00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:45.233
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today.

00:28:45.253 --> 00:28:50.818
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Mochi!

00:28:51.085 --> 00:29:06.512
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.585
Thank you, doggy, for today.

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:17.194
It is Mochi's birthday on the 21st!

00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:21.844
Happy birthday, Mochi!

00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:26.475
This doggy still loves cuddling and sunbathing, too.

00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:28.485
Very cute.

00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:33.692
I don't know, I don't really... Some things are not quite my thing, but... Oh, look at her here!

00:29:33.712 --> 00:29:34.913
Do you see her?

00:29:35.254 --> 00:29:37.056
Every doggy's different.

00:29:37.076 --> 00:29:39.039
She's camouflaged into the sofa!

00:29:40.521 --> 00:29:41.382
That's true.

00:29:41.402 --> 00:29:41.582
Yeah!

00:29:41.722 --> 00:29:42.303
What do you think?

00:29:43.164 --> 00:29:44.406
Snake, let me prowl at it!

00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:45.627
I think so, yeah.

00:29:46.469 --> 00:29:46.749
Yeah!

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:48.271
Oh, what is this camouflage?

00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:49.452
That's snake action?

00:29:50.454 --> 00:29:50.634
No!

00:29:50.654 --> 00:29:52.176
This is Mochi!

00:29:52.156 --> 00:29:53.738
What is this camo for?

00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:56.862
It's not chocochip, but... Mochi Mochi.

00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:58.244
Mochi Mochi.

00:30:00.026 --> 00:30:00.787
There you go!

00:30:00.807 --> 00:30:00.887
Yes!

00:30:00.907 --> 00:30:03.631
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Mochi BAU BAU?

00:30:09.038 --> 00:30:11.261
BAU BAU!

00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:12.642
BAU BAU!

00:30:13.343 --> 00:30:16.507
Very cute.

00:30:17.228 --> 00:30:17.389
BAU BAU!

00:30:17.409 --> 00:30:18.109
Like that.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.071
Like that?

00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:19.311
Yes!

00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:30.168
Wow!

00:30:30.188 --> 00:30:31.731
Mochi is the best doggy!

00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:34.396
You put her in front of me.

00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:36.039
Mochi!

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.101
Mochi!

00:30:38.825 --> 00:30:40.668
Then we just eat her all up!

00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:41.991
She's so cute!

00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.594
That's Mochi.

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.420
BAU BAU!

00:30:48.183 --> 00:30:49.686
Looks delicious.

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.228
BAU BAU!

00:30:51.448 --> 00:30:52.450
That's the Doggie of the Day!

00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:53.732
And!

00:30:53.932 --> 00:30:58.318
Next we have what "Today I Went on a Walk" corner!

00:30:58.338 --> 00:31:00.141
Ruffians, it's about the summer time!

00:31:00.221 --> 00:31:01.302
You're gonna get outside!

00:31:01.723 --> 00:31:02.524
Now is the time!

00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:08.092
So let's take a look what this Ruffian wears!

00:31:08.112 --> 00:31:08.532
We have... De-den!

00:31:08.793 --> 00:31:10.375
What is that?

00:31:10.395 --> 00:31:11.356
Salt ponds!

00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:13.739
Oh my gosh.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.881
They look pink.

00:31:14.901 --> 00:31:15.362
Right!

00:31:15.682 --> 00:31:16.343
Red?

00:31:16.363 --> 00:31:16.563
Red.

00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:19.167
Kinda reminds me a little bit of Evangelion.

00:31:19.957 --> 00:31:30.170
I wanna see that Moco-chan.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.497
I would though.

00:31:35.797 --> 00:31:36.938
I would try though.

00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:42.285
Is it not allowed?

00:31:43.717 --> 00:32:02.974
It's really bad for you.

00:32:03.848 --> 00:32:04.990
Okay!

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.657
Maybe you just have to bring some salt in your pocket, and you can just lick that, and then you're like, enjoy the experience.

00:32:09.697 --> 00:32:12.681
Like a cafe where you bring your own coffee.

00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:15.706
Yeah, like that kind of, yeah, just like that.

00:32:15.966 --> 00:32:23.458
But, you know the beach kind of smells kind of salty and silly and funny, and FUWAMOCO don't feel sick at the beach because it smells.

00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:27.364
But did it smell like that, but at times... Did you have fun?

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:32.792
I wonder what you do with the salt, the salt ponds.

00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:39.201
You know, I was never giving it a bit overwhelmed by the beach.

00:32:39.221 --> 00:32:39.321
Yeah.

00:32:40.684 --> 00:32:42.188
What does the city smell like?

00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:43.030
The beach.

00:32:44.554 --> 00:32:44.774
Yeah.

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:47.361
FUWAMOCO don't do well at the beach.

00:32:50.088 --> 00:32:50.308
Not really.

00:32:51.605 --> 00:32:53.308
I hope we didn't throw up.

00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:54.511
This is the sun.

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.795
I hope we didn't throw up.

00:32:57.156 --> 00:32:57.577
I don't know.

00:32:57.597 --> 00:32:58.879
I think this is really cool.

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:01.143
I wanna go too.

00:33:01.163 --> 00:33:05.171
As long as I don't throw up.

00:33:05.191 --> 00:33:06.514
BAU BAU!

00:33:06.534 --> 00:33:06.955
We hope you have fun.

00:33:06.975 --> 00:33:07.977
BAU BAU!

00:33:07.997 --> 00:33:09.259
Overwhelming beats.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.731
BAU BAU!

00:33:15.692 --> 00:33:17.974
Well, next we have our Question of the Day.

00:33:18.495 --> 00:33:24.521
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:33:24.541 --> 00:33:24.861
-Hi FUWAMOCO!
-Hello!

00:33:25.262 --> 00:33:31.287
After returning from Japan, I'm feeling motivated to further improve my Japanese to prepare for next time.

00:33:31.428 --> 00:33:32.529
Another Japan trip.

00:33:33.189 --> 00:33:33.850
My gosh.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:38.815
Do you have any tips for Ruffians who want to start learning or want to get more fluent?

00:33:38.995 --> 00:33:40.056
BAU BAU!

00:33:40.036 --> 00:33:42.419
Very good question!

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:46.125
I think this is on the minds of lots of Ruffians.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.907
For FUWAMOCO, first, have fun.

00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:48.949
Have fun.

00:33:48.969 --> 00:33:57.801
You know, and kind of language learning can't always be fun at times, so you know, things like watching anime and just being like, oh, maybe you recognize this.

00:33:58.121 --> 00:34:01.626
You're like, oh, this kind of sounds like this, and kind of repeat the sound.

00:34:01.947 --> 00:34:03.849
Maybe you can look into it more, you know.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.958
Sometimes there's games that have both English and Japanese at the same time in some official novels.

00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:12.421
Maybe you could kind of check those out too.

00:34:12.862 --> 00:34:16.166
But you know, immersing yourself really good, you know?

00:34:16.927 --> 00:34:18.309
Maybe one idea.

00:34:18.709 --> 00:34:24.576
Immersing yourself but then also switching it back to English and you'll be like, ah!

00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:25.998
I recognize this!

00:34:26.018 --> 00:34:26.759
Oh yeah.

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:32.767
But you know, maybe like making a Twitter account and talking with some JP Ruffians.

00:34:32.787 --> 00:34:38.494
You kind of start using some JP, Japanese and little bits here and there, you know?

00:34:38.474 --> 00:35:02.052
Could be a good practice.

00:35:02.032 --> 00:35:03.694
That mindset is more than half the battle, okay?

00:35:03.714 --> 00:35:03.974
I think so.

00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:05.837
Don't let that get to you, okay?

00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:06.037
No.

00:35:06.277 --> 00:35:07.379
It's just a big puzzle.

00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:07.779
Yeah.

00:35:07.799 --> 00:35:09.721
And it's important to make mistakes.

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:09.962
Yes.

00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:11.303
You learn from your mistakes.

00:35:11.463 --> 00:35:13.346
So you want to make the mistakes.

00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:14.848
You want to be extra silly.

00:35:14.888 --> 00:35:16.970
And then think, oh... Yeah.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.313
Call the tsuma, the wife, the uma, the horse.

00:35:19.413 --> 00:35:19.513
Yes.

00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:21.756
You know, make all of those mistakes.

00:35:22.577 --> 00:35:24.880
Or ask for ohashi-yuzera, ohiya.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.925
Yeah, you know, ask for the chopsticks instead of the glass of water.

00:35:28.945 --> 00:35:29.946
It's definitely a place with

00:35:29.926 --> 00:35:31.228
We don't use chopsticks.

00:35:31.508 --> 00:35:33.811
It's definitely a math, but not a space.

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:41.342
I think, you know, that especially being like, okay, I have to learn this much a day, maybe that might be a bit rough on you.

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:43.545
Maybe you'll start to feel a bit like a chore.

00:35:44.406 --> 00:35:45.708
Just go at your own pace.

00:35:46.209 --> 00:35:46.890
Have fun.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:53.279
I think having, you know, maybe talking to some Ruffians, you know, maybe there's other Ruffians learning Japanese too.

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:55.101
We can all talk together.

00:35:55.121 --> 00:35:57.925
You know, make mistakes together.

00:35:57.905 --> 00:36:00.809
And also have fun.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.733
Most important thing is having fun.

00:36:03.773 --> 00:36:04.254
Have fun.

00:36:04.594 --> 00:36:07.238
Make mistakes.

00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:09.581
BAU BAU!

00:36:10.483 --> 00:36:11.204
Thank you! Good luck!

00:36:11.224 --> 00:36:14.649
We hope your next trip is even more fun than your first trip.

00:36:14.669 --> 00:36:17.633
BAU BAU!

00:36:17.693 --> 00:36:22.419
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:23.261 --> 00:36:25.684
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make

00:36:25.664 --> 00:36:26.926
Together Ruffians!

00:36:27.327 --> 00:36:30.812
And now, temporarily, it's once a week.

00:36:30.832 --> 00:36:34.698
So, please remember, you know, throughout your week, maybe you see Pero.

00:36:35.039 --> 00:36:39.366
Maybe you have a very cute Doggie of the Day, or a question pops into your mind.

00:36:39.386 --> 00:36:41.950
Or where you go for a nice walk.

00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:45.695
Please share it with us with the hashtag!

00:36:45.715 --> 00:36:46.236
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:36:46.256 --> 00:36:48.600
Yes, don't be greedy, Shiori.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.264
Okay, Ruffians!

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:52.309
Please share your life with us!

00:36:52.449 --> 00:36:55.216
And maybe it'll be on the next FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:59.005
I said don't be greedy, but then you said share your life with us.

00:36:59.025 --> 00:37:00.228
That's pretty greedy.

00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:00.549
I'm greedy.

00:37:01.491 --> 00:37:04.699
BAU BAU!

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.312
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:07.332 --> 00:37:07.572
Thank you!

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:11.816
Oh, we have another stream coming up!

00:37:11.837 --> 00:37:11.917
Yes!

00:37:11.937 --> 00:37:13.778
Let's take a look!

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:17.502
Our next stream is... De-den!

00:37:17.522 --> 00:37:17.903
Super chat reading!

00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:18.283
Finally, Ruffians!

00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:20.325
We're gonna be doing some chatting all together.

00:37:20.425 --> 00:37:21.926
It gets super duper cozy!

00:37:21.967 --> 00:37:26.531
And we'll be reading some of your super chats!

00:37:26.551 --> 00:37:27.852
Yes! Thank you so much for waiting!

00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:28.633
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:29.794 --> 00:37:30.315
All your patience with us.

00:37:30.395 --> 00:37:30.535
I know.

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.559
I think you know, but things have been extra silly for us.

00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:35.361
It's been an interesting spring.

00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:39.467
But thank you Ruffians for being so patient.

00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:43.492
Thank you!

00:37:43.512 --> 00:37:43.712
Thank you!

00:37:43.732 --> 00:37:43.893
BAU BAU!

00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:45.495
BAU BAU!

00:37:45.515 --> 00:37:45.875
And our schedule!

00:37:45.895 --> 00:37:48.539
We have a new schedule for a new week and a new month!

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:55.448
And this week, we're gonna be continuing to play some more Old Market Simulator all together with Advent on Wednesday.

00:37:55.508 --> 00:37:56.610
Right?

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.273
You know we're getting pretty far, we can make potions?

00:37:59.253 --> 00:38:00.114
Love potions?

00:38:00.134 --> 00:38:01.075
I don't know, love potions?

00:38:02.297 --> 00:38:04.240
Does everyone want to buy love potions?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:10.088
Right, well there's going to be Valentine's Day coming up soon, so we want to get all prepared for that in the game.

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:12.090
And hopefully we can make more money!

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.956
Make it even more, better, old market!

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:16.697
An almost new market!

00:38:16.997 --> 00:38:17.357
Oh!

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:20.061
Yeah, all together with Advent!

00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:21.123
And after that!

00:38:21.143 --> 00:38:22.945
Well, we have a home market.

00:38:22.965 --> 00:38:24.467
We'll be doing homework.

00:38:25.257 --> 00:38:31.946
But on Friday, the PS2 is going back on because we're continuing Fatal Frame.

00:38:32.007 --> 00:38:38.135
It's a classic horror game and it started on the PS2 so we're starting from the very beginning.

00:38:38.155 --> 00:38:42.882
We've been exploring Himuro Mountain, looking for our brother.

00:38:42.902 --> 00:38:46.267
And hopefully this week we can complete it!

00:38:46.287 --> 00:38:47.008
That's the goal.

00:38:47.028 --> 00:38:50.052
So we'll be playing it on Friday and Saturday!

00:38:51.073 --> 00:38:53.577
Back with Fatal Frame, yeah!

00:38:53.557 --> 00:38:55.799
I bet it's been a lot of fun.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:57.501
We'll continue using our camera.

00:38:57.521 --> 00:38:59.142
Hopefully we can get some even better photos.

00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:01.965
We took some nice photos in Metal Gear Solid 3.

00:39:02.085 --> 00:39:03.767
Maybe we can take even more nice photos.

00:39:04.127 --> 00:39:04.808
More ghosts.

00:39:04.828 --> 00:39:05.428
Less frogs.

00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:06.670
And better frame.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.292
Guess Eva will show up though, huh?

00:39:09.352 --> 00:39:10.733
Who wanted a photo of Eva?

00:39:11.414 --> 00:39:12.035
Too bad.

00:39:12.835 --> 00:39:14.938
Maybe we can get a photo with her brother, though.

00:39:15.118 --> 00:39:15.498
Maybe.

00:39:16.759 --> 00:39:18.801
BAU BAU!

00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.724
And on Sunday we have another recording day.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.863
But!

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:29.130
A lot of fun things going on.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.615
Thank you Ruffians!

00:39:32.176 --> 00:39:32.537

00:39:32.557 --> 00:39:42.557

Temporarily on my knees.

00:39:49.943 --> 00:39:53.309
So if you're wondering where the FUWAMOCO Morning went, that's where it is.

00:39:57.778 --> 00:39:59.922
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:39:59.942 --> 00:40:05.312
Just in case there are some Ruffians who are extra sleepy and maybe missed a little bit of the beginning.

00:40:06.895 --> 00:40:12.586
But thank you so much for joining us today, FUWAMOCO Morning Ruffians!

00:40:13.167 --> 00:40:19.600
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
