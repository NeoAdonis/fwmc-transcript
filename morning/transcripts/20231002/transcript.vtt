00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.034
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:17.197
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:21.300
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.741
BAU!

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:27.085
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:27.445 --> 00:05:29.967
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:33.049
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:33.269
BAU!

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.832
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:45.094
Ruffians, thank you for joining us today for our 27th episode!

00:05:45.514 --> 00:05:47.995
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:50.196
For first-time Ruffians!

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:51.756
First-time Ruffians?

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:53.077
First-time Ruffians.

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.098
Ruffians that are here for the first time.

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:55.458
Yes!

00:05:55.698 --> 00:05:57.278
That's what makes you a first-time Ruffian.

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:05.964
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show that's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:07.765
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:11.647
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:17.531
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:22.615
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:27.478
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:28.219
BAU BAU!

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.301
A new start to a new day of a new month.

00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:38.622
Has he been around recently?

00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:41.022
We haven't seen him, but... A Pero Sighting!

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:41.182
De-den!

00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:56.703
Pero was found at a cat cafe.

00:06:56.823 --> 00:06:57.783
That's nice.

00:06:58.163 --> 00:07:05.926
It looks like he was seen trying so hard to fit in with the other cats that he even glued whiskers to his face.

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:09.867
That's kinda uncool, Pero.

00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:12.588
Did he do it because he's lonely?

00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:14.889
Or because he wants to get closer to the cats?

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.211
Or did he do it because he wants the cute girls to visit the cafe to pet him?

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:22.754
That's not good.

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:26.075
You know, to glue whiskers on his face, that's pretty desperate.

00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:27.075
Why?

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:29.576
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:34.397
You think that Pero is fine just the way he is, right?

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.777
He doesn't need the whiskers, right?

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:37.197
Right!

00:07:37.217 --> 00:07:42.138
Kick him out!

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:46.939
What if he just wants to enjoy the cats too, huh?

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.460
Pero's just... Pero's Pero, you know?

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.361
A stern talking to it.

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:58.666
Well, I don't see any Ruffians saying that Pero's just fine the way he is, you know.

00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:00.948
Well, right.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:02.369
Well, right.

00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:08.455
Well, you know, I think Pero's fine.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.116
He's nasty.

00:08:11.197 --> 00:08:12.779
But it'll be okay, right?

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:14.320
One day Pero'll be nice.

00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:18.694
I think he's fine in the shape and the way he is.

00:08:18.734 --> 00:08:22.236
His personality could get a bit of a makeover.

00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:25.938
But we're all, you know, we're all our own individual.

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:29.740
And that should be something that we're all very proud of, you know?

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:30.921
Right?

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:33.322
Ruffians, why didn't you say that?

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:35.724
Pero's gonna be upset if you don't say it.

00:08:36.264 --> 00:08:37.445
Don't say that, you know?

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.959
Ruffians, remember, okay?

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:46.521
At the very least, we shouldn't really have to worry about that.

00:08:57.982 --> 00:08:59.743
But he does have a big tongue.

00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:01.523
But the cats should be safe, yeah.

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:02.944
They should be.

00:09:03.124 --> 00:09:06.105
But if we were in a cafe, it's a bit of a different story.

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.586
But they're safe from Pero, it's good.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.587
BAU BAU!

00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:13.427
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:15.968
Please let us know if you see Pero around again.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:21.670
You can let us know with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.251
BAU BAU!

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:24.691
Ruffians!

00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:28.932
October!

00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:31.777
It's October!

00:09:31.937 --> 00:09:33.439
And with that...

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:39.626
It's a new month!

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.087
New hopes, yeah!

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:49.272
You know, and this is the first October FUWAMOCO Morning today, too!

00:09:49.732 --> 00:09:57.738
And yeah, like we mentioned, you know, a new month brings new hopes and dreams and goals that we want to reach, too!

00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:01.941
Did you spend some time to reflect on how September went for you, Ruffians?

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:08.644
We know that some people might think it's silly, but we think that reflecting is a really good habit.

00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:10.186
We do it often, right?

00:10:11.487 --> 00:10:13.309
What did you think of your September high?

00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.194
Were you able to reach your goals?

00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:21.233
You know, what went well, what could've been better.

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:28.696
I think for most people, and even us of course, you know, I don't think everything goes perfectly all the time.

00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:31.738
But you know, we were tired in September.

00:10:32.258 --> 00:10:35.740
And some things went well, other things could've been better.

00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:40.543
So, let's take some time, think about it, and figure out.

00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:42.938
What do we want for October?

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.298
Exactly.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:47.220
How can we better aim for that, you know?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.003
I think, for us, for FUWAMOCO, we want to focus more on our guard dog training, right?

00:10:54.484 --> 00:10:55.164
Yeah.

00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:55.824
Right.

00:10:55.924 --> 00:10:57.405
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:10:59.086 --> 00:10:59.546
Maybe.

00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:01.967
I don't know, maybe not.

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:03.888
Maybe, maybe yes, maybe not, maybe.

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:08.351
But, you're gonna have to hold our paw for that, okay?

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:10.452
It's gonna be tough, so, okay?

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:12.549
You're good for it.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.330
For the eye.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.251
Ruffians!

00:11:16.892 --> 00:11:18.974
Oh, that looks like Ruffians' eye.

00:11:19.094 --> 00:11:20.395
Okay.

00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:21.755
Okay.

00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:24.397
We'll work hard on that for October, okay?

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:35.304
But we also want to work on our sleeping habits and patterns so we can be more effective guard dogs and protect even more Ruffian smiles, okay?

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.828
I think you know.

00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:52.584
Also, in October, maybe it sounds a bit weird too, but they really like to lean on the other members more too.

00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:53.704
I know.

00:11:54.205 --> 00:11:56.505
After talking to them, we're always so happy.

00:11:56.885 --> 00:11:57.785
So it would be nice.

00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:05.567
Let's work hard towards becoming even stronger together for October, okay, Ruffians?

00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:08.143
BAU BAU!

00:12:08.203 --> 00:12:09.225
BAU BAU!

00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:10.086
It's October.

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:10.487
Bye.

00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:16.355
Actually there was some really good news.

00:12:16.455 --> 00:12:17.396
Happy news!

00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:20.701
I don't know if you realize, Ruffians, but...

00:12:22.068 --> 00:12:28.572
We have over 100 videos on our FUWAMOCO channel now!

00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:31.453
Wow, Ruffians!

00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:35.395
It's only two months and we already have over 100 videos!

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:36.836
Right!

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:38.017
Right!

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:39.878
So fast!

00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:41.519
So fast!

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.800
Thank you for supporting us, Ruffians!

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.001
Thank you!

00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:51.244
You know, it's not quite 100 livestreams, including no membership and unarchived streams yet, but...

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:52.185
Soon.

00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:54.708
Very soon for sure.

00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:56.249
We'll be there!

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.754
We can't wait until we hit 1,000 videos someday in 5-5 years.

00:12:59.794 --> 00:13:03.838
But if we hit 100 in 2 months, then can't you do the math?

00:13:03.858 --> 00:13:04.159
20 months?

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.550
What's the math on that, Ruffians?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.450
Do the math!

00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:20.371
I don't think it's gonna be something that you can just solve with a math equation, though.

00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:21.932
Math equation?

00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:22.892
Math equation.

00:13:24.532 --> 00:13:25.892
I don't think so, you know.

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:26.312
20 months.

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:29.653
One year and eight months.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:32.694
Okay, two years.

00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:33.614
Two years.

00:13:33.634 --> 00:13:35.194
That's the goal.

00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:36.554
Two years?

00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:37.575
Two years.

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:39.235
Should we try, Ruffians?

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:42.935
That might be really tricky, Domoco-chan, you know?

00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.336
I think it might be tricky.

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:46.117
Three years.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.019
Let's make the goal three years, okay?

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.901
I don't know if the math is good, but three years, okay?

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:57.046
Actually, I was taking a peek at some of our senpai's channels to see who has a thousand videos.

00:13:57.546 --> 00:14:00.528
And I was surprised to see which senpai do and maybe don't.

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:01.649
Right?

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:06.073
But it also makes sense because they're very busy in lots of different ways, too.

00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:08.755
Should we hope to also be busy, too?

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:12.619
We're gonna be busy.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:22.026
But you know, it's also happy to be busy outside of YouTube too, so... Let's do our best!

00:14:22.627 --> 00:14:24.949
I want everything too.

00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:26.610
Greedy.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.230
I'm greedy.

00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:35.537
We'll continue to work hard here and outside of YouTube too, you know, whether it be streams or videos or sorts.

00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:42.266
BAU BAU!

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:46.447
And it's also another special day.

00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:51.568
It's a special day today, not just our first October FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:56.629
But, Ruffians, I don't know, maybe there's some Ruffians that realized it.

00:14:57.289 --> 00:14:59.890
Ruffians, can you guess what special day it is today?

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:04.177
Okay, I'll give you a clue.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.259
It is October 2nd.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.821
October 2nd.

00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:11.143
That's the day today.

00:15:11.283 --> 00:15:11.823
It is.

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:17.969
It doesn't have to do with Monday.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.031
Or Natto.

00:15:20.551 --> 00:15:22.513
Not that much.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:30.655
Korone-senpai's birthday was yesterday though.

00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:31.335
Is it?

00:15:32.136 --> 00:15:32.957
You know.

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:38.160
Special.

00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:39.521
Okay, let's give it to them.

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:41.423
Okay, the Ruffians didn't call it.

00:15:42.003 --> 00:15:45.666
Wow, I can't believe you didn't know this, Ruffians!

00:15:45.806 --> 00:15:46.767
Okay!

00:15:46.787 --> 00:15:50.129
Today is... Tofu Day!

00:15:53.297 --> 00:15:57.360
October 2nd is Tofu Day!

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.700
It's Tofu Day!

00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:04.244
Ten can be read in Japanese as To and Chu and Fu, so Tofu.

00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:07.566
I bet you're surprised.

00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:10.588
You didn't even know it was a day to celebrate, huh?

00:16:10.628 --> 00:16:12.229
Tofu Day!

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:14.991
Toho Day would be cool too, but...

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.432
Not today, you know.

00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:21.295
Yeah, you know, but tofu is so yummy!

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:30.241
I think there might be some Ruffians who think tofu doesn't have much flavor to it, but that's exactly why tofu is wonderful too!

00:16:30.341 --> 00:16:33.182
You know, it's a blank canvas for your favorite flavors.

00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:35.824
There's so many different things you can do with it!

00:16:35.904 --> 00:16:36.445
Right!

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:38.406
You can make it spicy, you can make it...

00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:41.528
If you like that, I guess, you can make a deep fry.

00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:43.270
You can put it in the soup.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.991
Oh yeah, you can deep fry it.

00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:45.572
You can.

00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:47.694
I just thought it might be dangerous.

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:49.996
Also!

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.738
It's not tofu, but it's like in the family.

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:53.338
The family.

00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:54.539
The tofu family.

00:16:54.599 --> 00:16:55.820
Soy milk!

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.481
Yeah!

00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:59.323
Or as we like to call it, tofu milk.

00:16:59.363 --> 00:17:00.364
Tofu milk!

00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:01.465
Yeah!

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:02.606
Tofu milk!

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:05.909
We've talked about it before, but we really like soy milk.

00:17:06.469 --> 00:17:08.471
My favorite is Kikkoman.

00:17:08.551 --> 00:17:10.252
Yeah, Kikkoman.

00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:13.315
You know when we were doing guard dog training in Japan?

00:17:13.335 --> 00:17:18.619
At one point, we got so addicted to the black tea flavor that they would sell.

00:17:21.263 --> 00:17:26.909
It was so bad at one point that we bought big cartons by the box.

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.651
By the box, yeah.

00:17:29.092 --> 00:17:30.693
It's just so yummy!

00:17:30.934 --> 00:17:35.919
But they have different flavors too, like not just the black tea flavor, not just the milk.

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:39.423
They have a lot of flavors.

00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:42.846
And our second favorite flavor is the red bean flavor.

00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:48.844
Ruffians, think of a flavor that you think would be good for soy milk.

00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:51.465
Which flavor do you think would be enticing to you?

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:00.689
Never had tofu before.

00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:02.570
Vanilla, they have vanilla!

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.330
Almond, they have almond!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.371
Cucumber, they don't have that.

00:18:05.571 --> 00:18:06.631
Banana milk, they have that!

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:07.772
Strawberry, they have that!

00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:09.133
Strawberry, yes!

00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:09.833
Matcha, yes!

00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:10.653
Chocolate, yes!

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:12.294
Maple, I'm sure they must.

00:18:13.355 --> 00:18:15.056
Pineapple, yes!

00:18:15.336 --> 00:18:16.316
Sea chocolate, yes!

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:17.317
Azuki, yes!

00:18:17.337 --> 00:18:19.998
So many flavors!

00:18:20.778 --> 00:18:21.819
Lavender, maybe not.

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:23.300
It's a bit fancy, but maybe!

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.640
Light tea, yes!

00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:26.901
Light sesame, yes!

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:31.030
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:18:43.863 --> 00:18:49.887
Maybe one day we'll buy as many as we can and taste test them all for you!

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:53.129
Buy a lot of different flavors, you know?

00:18:53.729 --> 00:19:00.834
It's a bit of a silly mini dream, but a big soy milk party and taste all the flavors.

00:19:01.114 --> 00:19:02.254
It sounds fun, right?

00:19:02.294 --> 00:19:03.035
Yeah!

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:06.597
You'll have to drink lots of soy milk with us too, Ruffians, okay?

00:19:06.637 --> 00:19:11.860
Just a little tiny of each flavor, but it'll be a lot of soy milk.

00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:15.582
BAU BAU!

00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:18.183
Happy Tofu Day, Ruffians!

00:19:18.203 --> 00:19:21.364
Let's all celebrate by eating tofu.

00:19:21.384 --> 00:19:24.705
Yeah, don't have it this straight if you don't want that.

00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:25.425
Not like this.

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:26.846
It looks like a block of paper.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:31.107
BAU BAU!

00:19:33.168 --> 00:19:34.768
Such a happy... Happy day.

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:35.769
Happy day.

00:19:35.869 --> 00:19:36.449
Happy day.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.430
But...

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.921
Ruffians.

00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:56.723
To be honest, today, we thought we could maybe get to today without any misunderstandings, you know?

00:19:57.063 --> 00:20:03.065
But accidentally, we made a misunderstanding ourselves.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:04.245
We did.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:05.526
Yeah.

00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:10.687
Do you realize what we lost?

00:20:11.567 --> 00:20:17.573
You realize we were trying so hard to not make any misunderstandings, too.

00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:20.776
Aren't we always trying to avoid the misunderstandings?

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:23.779
We never cause them ourselves, right?

00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:30.906
But, well, I guess... Ruffians!

00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:34.649
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, there was something weird, right?

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.830
No.

00:20:35.754 --> 00:20:36.014
Right?

00:20:36.595 --> 00:20:37.596
You noticed it, right?

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.899
I think the Ruffians noticed it, Moco-chan.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.540
I don't know.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.324
Well, you know, there was no misunderstanding.

00:20:46.384 --> 00:20:47.344
No mention of it.

00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:48.445
Nothing!

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:49.927
Nothing at all.

00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:52.009
We're sorry if we disappointed you.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.852
But, but, it's okay.

00:20:56.112 --> 00:20:57.854
Because, you know, there was none.

00:20:57.934 --> 00:20:59.555
There was no misunderstanding.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:06.537
Not until now, so, uh, yeah, uh, we had no misunderstandings last time.

00:21:06.797 --> 00:21:07.397
Yay.

00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:10.198
Do you think we could do this trick, Moco-chan?

00:21:10.218 --> 00:21:16.119
No, no, no, no, because we inadvertently made another one by forgetting it last time.

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:18.580
Ruffians!

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.880
We'll try better next time, okay?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.220
Yeah.

00:21:24.088 --> 00:21:24.469
One day.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.711
A future.

00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:28.635
A future without misunderstandings.

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.055
One day.

00:21:29.296 --> 00:21:29.676
One day.

00:21:30.177 --> 00:21:32.520
It'll be a beautiful, sparkly day.

00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:41.171
Celebrate with us, okay Ruffians?

00:21:41.952 --> 00:21:47.577
Well Ruffians, it's the start of a new week for the fifth time.

00:21:47.597 --> 00:21:55.103
The start of a new week, which means... Oh, oh, and it's also, it's also Tofu Day.

00:21:56.736 --> 00:21:57.176
Extra.

00:21:57.376 --> 00:22:06.619
Extra means that Moco-chan will be continuing to challenge herself to eat natto today!

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:11.740
Today this is Moco-chan's fourth time trying to eat natto.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.900
To try to conquer.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.440
To overcome it.

00:22:14.821 --> 00:22:15.881
To challenge yourself.

00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:18.321
I don't want the fluffiness!

00:22:18.741 --> 00:22:20.202
I want the fuzziness!

00:22:20.242 --> 00:22:20.302
No...

00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:46.426
Oh no, just a little bit.

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:47.066
Just a little bit.

00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:49.127
Just a little bit.

00:22:49.207 --> 00:22:51.907
But yes, natto is really healthy for you.

00:22:52.408 --> 00:22:53.948
And this is why we want Moco-chan to eat it.

00:22:53.968 --> 00:22:55.248
I do want to eat it.

00:22:55.528 --> 00:22:56.869
Okay, I do want to eat it.

00:22:56.929 --> 00:23:03.850
But if you cook it, then you know you can continue to protect the Ruffian smile for many, many years to come.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.551
Just like me.

00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.371
But Ruffians, you feel inspired, right?

00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:10.152
By my challenge, right?

00:23:10.172 --> 00:23:11.352
Because I do want to eat it.

00:23:12.253 --> 00:23:13.575
But this is difficult.

00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:18.842
And I want to do it, but if someone wants to push me to it, I don't want to do it.

00:23:20.124 --> 00:23:22.247
I feel inspired!

00:23:23.177 --> 00:23:23.737
Right!

00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:27.700
If you're hot, Mococo is working hard!

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.362
And something difficult that she wants to do!

00:23:30.382 --> 00:23:30.502
Yeah!

00:23:31.882 --> 00:23:33.904
So I'm gonna work hard too, right?

00:23:33.924 --> 00:23:35.725
I think she's extra ready.

00:23:35.765 --> 00:23:37.466
Cuz I'm doing it for you, okay?!

00:23:38.226 --> 00:23:40.288
It's extra ready, Moco-chan!

00:23:40.308 --> 00:23:41.288
What does that mean?

00:23:41.388 --> 00:23:43.229
It smells very strong today.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.670
Why?

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:49.093
Maybe just because this natto is very... It's the same.

00:23:49.273 --> 00:23:49.713
Happy.

00:23:50.093 --> 00:23:50.393
Happy.

00:23:50.413 --> 00:23:51.554
It's the same as always.

00:23:51.574 --> 00:23:53.054
It's different, natto.

00:23:53.074 --> 00:23:53.674
Tochigi!

00:23:53.914 --> 00:23:54.975
Tochigi!

00:23:55.595 --> 00:23:58.676
I'm not stalling, I'm telling you my life story.

00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:14.240
Well, you know, I've seen some Japanese Ruffians saying that maybe they should let Moco-chan put the tare sauce on top of it, but... You know, Moco-chan's strong, and I feel like it's more polite to the beans this way, too, so... Oh, it doesn't expire.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:14.880
I think I can do it.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.542
Natto doesn't expire.

00:24:16.682 --> 00:24:20.265
It just gets dry, so it's not yummy.

00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:26.151
But Moco-chan, today your goal is three beans.

00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:28.013
I would like to sleep more.

00:24:28.073 --> 00:24:30.736
No, because I wasn't able to eat three last time.

00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:32.378
What's the extra bean, Moco-chan?

00:24:32.418 --> 00:24:33.679
I don't have a tissue.

00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:36.352
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:37.173
I'm not ready!

00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:40.234
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi!

00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:42.354
Who worked very hard to make this.

00:24:42.494 --> 00:24:44.495
Thank you, I know you worked really hard.

00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:46.196
It's not gonna get wasted.

00:24:46.216 --> 00:24:50.517
Just so you know, Ruffians, Fuwawa always eats it, so it's not wasted, okay?

00:24:51.317 --> 00:24:52.158
Very important.

00:24:52.998 --> 00:24:55.759
Okay, well, Moco-chan, here you are!

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:58.440
You're right, it does smell really strong today.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.481
I have Moco-chan's favorite chopsticks for her, too.

00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:02.581
No tissue, though.

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:04.537
I have a tissue.

00:25:04.557 --> 00:25:05.038
No tissue.

00:25:05.078 --> 00:25:05.478
Forget that.

00:25:05.498 --> 00:25:06.279
I really want a tissue.

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:07.079
Forget that.

00:25:07.479 --> 00:25:09.060
Tissue's not gonna go in your mouth.

00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:17.666
It's the natto that's gonna... It's so neba neba today.

00:25:17.686 --> 00:25:18.586
Take your virus from Tochigi.

00:25:18.626 --> 00:25:19.727
Thank you.

00:25:20.107 --> 00:25:21.728
It's so neba neba today.

00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:23.550
Very slimy, huh?

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.850
Very sticky.

00:25:32.774 --> 00:25:34.915
Once again, I'm looking for some good beans, okay?

00:25:35.215 --> 00:25:36.075
Good beans?

00:25:36.716 --> 00:25:37.936
They're all good though.

00:25:38.816 --> 00:25:40.717
Particularly good beans, okay?

00:25:42.398 --> 00:25:43.738
They're all good.

00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:49.700
Are you sure you can't just, um, use... Get the neba neba off of it?

00:25:50.721 --> 00:25:51.101
No.

00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:53.135
Okay, Moco-chan, hurry up!

00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:53.935
Hurry up!

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:54.996
I'm trying!

00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:55.256
I'm trying!

00:25:55.276 --> 00:25:57.197
Don't call me a dude!

00:25:57.237 --> 00:25:57.397
Why?

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:13.465
This is just one bean.

00:26:13.525 --> 00:26:14.885
I'm trying to get them.

00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:16.606
Are you going to go one bean at a time?

00:26:16.646 --> 00:26:17.646
No, of course not.

00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:20.587
I'm trying to gather... Why is it so neba neba?

00:26:20.627 --> 00:26:22.127
Where's the non-neba neba one?

00:26:22.807 --> 00:26:24.567
No, you need to eat them all.

00:26:24.907 --> 00:26:29.968
I just smelled it a bit.

00:26:30.068 --> 00:26:31.589
It just wafted over here.

00:26:31.649 --> 00:26:32.849
I didn't even get close.

00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:37.350
Wow, you didn't even give it permission to waft over here.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.270
I didn't.

00:26:39.713 --> 00:26:40.954
Why is it bad today?

00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:45.216
Moco-chan already had something to eat, too.

00:26:45.356 --> 00:26:45.816
I didn't.

00:26:45.976 --> 00:26:46.737
Yeah, that's true.

00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:47.237
Oh, I did!

00:26:48.257 --> 00:26:48.978
I forgot.

00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:51.219
I gave you soup, remember?

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:53.400
Okay, I'm trying to stack them.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.701
Stack the beans like Tetris.

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.483
Moco-chan, that's playing with your food.

00:26:58.503 --> 00:26:59.283
That's not good.

00:26:59.303 --> 00:27:00.083
Ah, it's not!

00:27:00.103 --> 00:27:01.004
Because they're sticky.

00:27:03.325 --> 00:27:06.667
Wait, so the Tetris pieces are just sticky and they're not for you?

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.563
One second, one second, one second!

00:27:18.164 --> 00:27:19.245
It's time, Moco-chan.

00:27:22.717 --> 00:27:24.738
I'm not being evil, I'm being supportive.

00:27:24.758 --> 00:27:26.238
Moco-chan wants to do this.

00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:28.399
Moco-chan, you want to do this, right?

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:29.699
But I actually need a tissue.

00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:31.840
Because I actually need a tissue.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.061
I don't know what to do, Moco-chan.

00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:35.821
I actually need a tissue.

00:27:37.802 --> 00:27:39.002
What if you just eat it?

00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:41.843
Don't use the tissue, you need to eat it, Moco-chan.

00:27:41.943 --> 00:27:43.223
Every time you don't eat it.

00:27:43.243 --> 00:27:45.704
It just goes in your mouth and then you spit it out.

00:27:45.744 --> 00:27:46.404
It's not good.

00:27:46.524 --> 00:27:47.765
I'm doing my best, okay?

00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:48.445
That's not good!

00:27:50.834 --> 00:27:52.655
You're serious about this, right Moco-chan?

00:27:52.735 --> 00:27:53.556
I'm serious.

00:27:53.856 --> 00:27:54.317
Are you?

00:27:54.337 --> 00:27:55.598
Okay.

00:27:55.658 --> 00:27:56.839
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.061
That's one... Three beans!

00:27:59.181 --> 00:28:00.782
Oh, that is three beans.

00:28:00.902 --> 00:28:03.325
I have confirmed that is definitely three beans.

00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:04.566
Okay.

00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:06.267
Okay Moco-chan, you're gonna do it!

00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:13.833
I'm trying to get used to the smell because I was already done in by it, okay?

00:28:14.213 --> 00:28:15.134
It's getting close.

00:28:16.014 --> 00:28:18.336
I'm just trying to like, get used to it, okay?

00:28:18.356 --> 00:28:19.697
Open wide, Mococo!

00:28:20.078 --> 00:28:21.839
Not yet, not yet.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.090
Moco-chan, you can do it!

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:25.670
You can do it!

00:28:26.091 --> 00:28:26.471
Wow.

00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:27.151
Wow.

00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:31.132
I don't know if I'm a Ruffian or not, but I sneezed five times in a row because my nose is very, uh, not working today, but now I feel like it is.

00:28:31.152 --> 00:28:31.412
That's good.

00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:33.453
See, good things happen when you have natto, Moco-chan.

00:28:33.504 --> 00:28:35.605
I'm not waking today, but now I feel like it is.

00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:37.026
That's good.

00:28:37.086 --> 00:28:39.548
See, good things happen when you have natto, Moco-chan.

00:28:39.788 --> 00:28:44.771
I'm just smelling it.

00:28:47.112 --> 00:28:47.372
Okay.

00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:52.638
I'm just

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:54.176
Okay, ready?

00:28:55.957 --> 00:28:57.037
Should I chew it?

00:28:57.577 --> 00:28:58.957
You should eat it, Moco-chan.

00:28:59.477 --> 00:29:00.637
You know you need to chew to eat it.

00:29:00.658 --> 00:29:02.718
Can you promise me I will have water after?

00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:04.138
As long as I chew it.

00:29:04.498 --> 00:29:06.699
As long as it stays in you, you know?

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:07.059
What?

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:07.999
That you eat it.

00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:10.720
That doesn't go into the tissue.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.380
Can I use the tissue on my tongue after?

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.401
Not on the tongue.

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.341
You can use it on your lips.

00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:19.921
Like a napkin.

00:29:20.382 --> 00:29:21.722
I wanna use it on my tongue.

00:29:22.122 --> 00:29:22.202
No.

00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:27.226
I'm trying to figure out my strategy, okay?

00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:29.466
Moco-chan!

00:29:29.486 --> 00:29:31.107
I'm trying, I'm trying!

00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:32.427
It's been five minutes!

00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:33.627
Fii!

00:29:33.987 --> 00:29:35.368
No, no, no, no!

00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:37.128
I'm stopping you.

00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:38.428
Okay.

00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:41.429
Please don't let the fish in.

00:29:41.689 --> 00:29:42.809
I'm not stalling!

00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:44.330
I am preparing.

00:29:48.345 --> 00:29:49.226
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:29:49.727 --> 00:29:51.309
Here we go!

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.330
10!

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:52.730
8!

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.730
No, 10!

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.730
9!

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.730
8!

00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:56.730
7!

00:29:57.211 --> 00:29:57.730
6!

00:29:58.231 --> 00:29:58.730
5!

00:29:59.251 --> 00:29:59.730
4!

00:30:00.072 --> 00:30:00.730
3!

00:30:01.092 --> 00:30:02.730
2! 1!

00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:05.264
I tried!

00:30:05.424 --> 00:30:05.884
I tried!

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:06.585
Give me a moment!

00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:07.405
Give me a moment!

00:30:08.426 --> 00:30:08.766
Do it!

00:30:08.946 --> 00:30:09.206
Go!

00:30:09.566 --> 00:30:09.927
Go!

00:30:10.407 --> 00:30:10.747
Go!

00:30:11.708 --> 00:30:12.948
In!

00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:14.949
This is so pathetic.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.690
Do it!

00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:18.331
Moco-chan.

00:30:21.353 --> 00:30:25.576
You're just opening your mouth and it's floating and then going away.

00:30:25.596 --> 00:30:27.597
Moco-chan, don't think, just do!

00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:28.537
Exactly!

00:30:28.737 --> 00:30:29.378
Exactly!

00:30:31.639 --> 00:30:32.982
I'm gonna turn off my brain, okay?

00:30:33.002 --> 00:30:33.603
Turn it off!

00:30:33.743 --> 00:30:34.284
You're eating!

00:30:34.304 --> 00:30:35.627
Okay, brain off.

00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:36.047
Brain off!

00:30:37.458 --> 00:30:37.978
In it goes.

00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:39.759
I can't turn it off.

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.260
My brain wants to stay on.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.641
Mocoto.

00:30:42.681 --> 00:30:43.741
I really want to try.

00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:44.862
I really want to try.

00:30:44.902 --> 00:30:46.663
You want to do this, right?

00:30:46.703 --> 00:30:48.104
You want to do this?

00:30:48.144 --> 00:30:49.925
You want to do this?

00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:50.585
Okay.

00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:51.385
3, 2, 1.

00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:52.006
I want to do it.

00:30:52.066 --> 00:30:52.626
Don't stop.

00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:53.887
Don't, don't, don't.

00:30:53.927 --> 00:30:55.488
Don't stop.

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:57.189
Wait, Shizu.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:30:57.689
Don't.

00:30:57.729 --> 00:30:58.409
Wait, stop.

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:00.450
Okay, I want to do it.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.691
I want to do it.

00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:02.812
I want to do it.

00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:06.111
Here we go!

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:07.111
3, 2, 1!

00:31:07.652 --> 00:31:07.972
It's in!

00:31:08.173 --> 00:31:08.473
It's in!

00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:08.973
It's in!

00:31:09.314 --> 00:31:10.255
Oh, it got some strings.

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:11.756
Moco-chan's wiping her lips.

00:31:11.816 --> 00:31:12.296
That's good.

00:31:12.877 --> 00:31:13.137
Chew it!

00:31:13.237 --> 00:31:13.498
Chew it!

00:31:13.558 --> 00:31:14.719
Don't spit it out!

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:14.999
Chew it!

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:16.901
Chew it!

00:31:17.701 --> 00:31:17.822
Oh!

00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:18.622
Oh!

00:31:18.642 --> 00:31:19.203
Swallow!

00:31:19.223 --> 00:31:20.284
Swallow!

00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:21.125
You can do it!

00:31:21.485 --> 00:31:22.646
You can do it!

00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:23.627
You can do it!

00:31:24.287 --> 00:31:24.508
Yeah!

00:31:24.568 --> 00:31:25.048
Yeah!

00:31:25.248 --> 00:31:25.869
Yeah!

00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:26.069
Oh!

00:31:26.429 --> 00:31:26.570
Oh!

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:26.990
Oh?

00:31:31.543 --> 00:31:35.345
Wait, you didn't chew it at all!

00:31:35.385 --> 00:31:36.786
They just sat in there!

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:41.349
I tried!

00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:42.309
I tried!

00:31:42.329 --> 00:31:46.252
I had it in my mouth for so long!

00:31:46.312 --> 00:31:47.432
It was good, though!

00:31:47.452 --> 00:31:49.013
I tried!

00:31:49.193 --> 00:31:49.814
It was yummy!

00:31:49.934 --> 00:31:51.495
I left tears, though!

00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:55.337
I tried really hard, Ruffians!

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:07.112
That was another attempt.

00:32:08.873 --> 00:32:13.516
Let's remember Moco-chan's struggles.

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:17.818
Moco-chan's struggles to overcome her hardship with natto.

00:32:17.918 --> 00:32:22.321
And let's do our best to overcome our own troubles this week too, okay?

00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:24.403
BAU BAU!

00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:24.963
I tried.

00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:26.304
Moco-chan, say BAU BAU.

00:32:29.577 --> 00:32:30.517
BAU BAU!

00:32:31.137 --> 00:32:31.418
BAU BAU!

00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:34.679
BAU BAU!

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:35.599
I tried.

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:36.979
I tried.

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:38.100
You did, you did.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.160
I need hand pads and I don't have water.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.881
Give me hand pads and tissues with my tears and water, please.

00:32:44.821 --> 00:32:46.662
Renato was in there for a while.

00:32:46.782 --> 00:32:47.862
I was really excited.

00:32:48.002 --> 00:32:49.223
I thought you could do it, Moco-chan.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.383
Next time... Doggie of the Day!

00:32:55.403 --> 00:33:01.207
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Sky!

00:33:01.808 --> 00:33:03.409
Look at Sky!

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.321
Look at the eyes!

00:33:11.341 --> 00:33:12.842
It's like my eyes right now!

00:33:12.862 --> 00:33:13.663
It's really cute, right?

00:33:28.852 --> 00:33:29.933
Right?

00:33:30.373 --> 00:33:35.878
It's like the eyes saying, I've had enough natto, can I go home now?

00:33:36.779 --> 00:33:37.199
No!

00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:38.680
No, you don't!

00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:41.223
These eyes love natto!

00:33:41.803 --> 00:33:42.644
They're excited!

00:33:42.724 --> 00:33:44.285
They have energy!

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:45.106
They can do it!

00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:47.808
Their eyes have a good time, right?

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:50.610
Right?

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.833
So cute!

00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:56.756
Well, Moco-chan, how does Sky say BAU BAU?

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:03.696
I think that's Moco-chan's heart saying BAU BAU.

00:34:04.878 --> 00:34:10.844
I don't know, I think it's when I got BAU BAU, right?

00:34:11.705 --> 00:34:12.807
I think you know Sky?

00:34:13.147 --> 00:34:13.507
Sky?

00:34:15.666 --> 00:34:16.506
It's doing the best.

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:16.946
Yes!

00:34:17.006 --> 00:34:20.868
It's good to go for walks, but... Yeah, all dogs are a bit different, right?

00:34:21.148 --> 00:34:21.588
Ah, right.

00:34:21.948 --> 00:34:27.190
And maybe Sky likes to be on the couch more than out in nature getting exercise.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.230
Maybe some days.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.391
That's fine, I guess.

00:34:29.411 --> 00:34:31.812
Yeah, I think that's totally fine, you know?

00:34:31.912 --> 00:34:35.133
So... But... I don't know.

00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:43.736
On those days when we're just like, I don't wanna go outside, I think it's okay to just curl up on the couch, you know?

00:34:44.529 --> 00:34:46.070
Today I went on a walk!

00:34:46.711 --> 00:34:48.532
Where did this Ruffian go for a walk?

00:34:48.632 --> 00:34:48.952
De-den!

00:35:06.631 --> 00:35:07.712
It's Akihabara.

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:10.214
A walk in Akihabara!

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:11.115
Mansei Baishi!

00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:14.038
This photo is from the Mansei Baishi bridge.

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:16.600
Looking gorgeous, kind of.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.081
It's so pretty.

00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:20.163
I don't know if we've ever seen it quite like this.

00:35:20.263 --> 00:35:20.683
Really?

00:35:20.763 --> 00:35:22.004
It's nice.

00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:23.225
Very romantic.

00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:23.606
Right?

00:35:23.686 --> 00:35:24.246
I know!

00:35:24.447 --> 00:35:27.009
Akihabara being Akihabara and everything.

00:35:27.049 --> 00:35:31.312
You wouldn't think that there'd be a view this romantic there, right?

00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:32.534
Mansei Baishi is nice.

00:35:34.207 --> 00:35:45.990
But you know, I hope that you had a bunch of fun in Akihabara and that maybe you weren't too surprised when everything closed up and it got dark at around 8pm.

00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:52.132
It always surprises us too, because Akihabara closes very early, right?

00:35:52.372 --> 00:35:56.233
And you know, you just want to have more fun in Akihabara, right?

00:35:56.273 --> 00:35:58.634
Too bad it closes rather early.

00:35:59.614 --> 00:36:00.815
Gotta be quick.

00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:01.996
Gotta be quick.

00:36:02.996 --> 00:36:04.738
BAU BAU!

00:36:04.758 --> 00:36:07.680
And next we have the Question of the Day!

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.181
What question do we have today?

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:11.002
De-den!

00:36:11.582 --> 00:36:13.083
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:14.144
Hello!

00:36:14.164 --> 00:36:18.407
Now that we are a few days in autumn... Moco-chan!

00:36:18.807 --> 00:36:21.869
Same as last time!

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.412
This is not the question of today, this was the question of last time.

00:36:29.514 --> 00:36:31.580
What's the question of today?

00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:41.129
Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:36:41.209 --> 00:36:42.070
I have a question.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:48.192
Since I also have a twin brother myself, so I can't help but be curious.

00:36:48.632 --> 00:36:53.374
Do you two have experience about sharing one thing between each other by taking a twin?

00:36:53.754 --> 00:36:55.574
Do you two ever have a fight because of that?

00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:56.635
Thank you!

00:36:57.135 --> 00:36:58.275
Thank you for the question!

00:37:00.536 --> 00:37:03.178
Sharing is the name of our lives, I think.

00:37:03.518 --> 00:37:04.639
It's everything.

00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:08.101
So I think we're pretty good at it, right?

00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:09.982
Yeah, but sometimes we aren't!

00:37:10.262 --> 00:37:11.683
No, sometimes we aren't, yeah.

00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:21.368
But we do squabble about things here and there, but when we do it's always over-silly things like food or computer time or something like that.

00:37:22.769 --> 00:37:24.710
But most recently, it was the Switch.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.771
Yeah.

00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:27.532
Ruffians, you know, right?

00:37:28.072 --> 00:37:28.692
We know it!

00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:31.193
Some Ruffians, because you saw us tweet, right?

00:37:32.054 --> 00:37:34.315
Ruffians just said, oh, get a second Switch!

00:37:35.015 --> 00:37:36.996
It's not easy, you can't do that!

00:37:37.036 --> 00:37:37.996
No, it's not just like that.

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:38.897
You have to share!

00:37:38.917 --> 00:37:40.337
That's not how you do it, Ruffians.

00:37:40.437 --> 00:37:44.139
We don't use the Switch enough to get two Switches, that's silly.

00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:47.340
But when we use the Switch, we both want to use the Switch at the same time!

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.701
Exactly!

00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:49.441
So then we share it.

00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:53.363
One round of Suika game, other round of Suika game.

00:37:53.923 --> 00:37:54.284
Yeah.

00:37:54.364 --> 00:37:54.704
Yeah.

00:37:56.645 --> 00:38:01.188
But food, you know, that obviously needs to be very equal.

00:38:01.248 --> 00:38:05.892
So, you know, if Fuwawa has a more delicious mushroom in her soup, then I want that.

00:38:08.746 --> 00:38:09.787
It's a bit complicated.

00:38:09.907 --> 00:38:17.229
It's not that easy, but you know, we just remind ourselves that we'll be all equal out in the end.

00:38:17.889 --> 00:38:19.249
It's not a big deal, you know?

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.070
Even though sometimes it might be really hard to do that.

00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:24.171
Just remember, you know?

00:38:24.471 --> 00:38:26.472
Ruffians, you know how to share too, though, right?

00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:27.973
You should.

00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:31.756
It's a very important skill, okay?

00:38:31.796 --> 00:38:31.996
Right?

00:38:32.036 --> 00:38:34.498
But just keep on remembering, you know?

00:38:34.558 --> 00:38:36.180
Sharing, you know?

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.281
It's important.

00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:38.322
It's important.

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:40.443
It's not worth creating your bond over that, so.

00:38:40.463 --> 00:38:40.624
Yeah.

00:38:45.988 --> 00:38:46.949
BAU BAU!

00:38:47.029 --> 00:38:48.430
Thank you for the question!

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.152
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:38:50.192 --> 00:38:54.075
You sure took a long time eating natto, so... Let's go fast here!

00:38:54.095 --> 00:38:55.676
Our next theme!

00:38:56.337 --> 00:39:00.160
Today we're going to be focusing on some homework and recording.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.481
Going very, very hard on those.

00:39:02.542 --> 00:39:06.224
But we'll be back tomorrow with... De-den!

00:39:06.525 --> 00:39:07.746
Parasol Show!

00:39:08.066 --> 00:39:09.027
Parasol Show!

00:39:09.327 --> 00:39:11.289
Not the closing shit, Parasol Show!

00:39:11.609 --> 00:39:12.289
Yes!

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.972
It's another very popular game from Chiyo's life.

00:39:15.652 --> 00:39:18.694
Who made the closing shift that's why it's like this.

00:39:18.794 --> 00:39:20.536
And we played it a few weeks ago.

00:39:20.556 --> 00:39:23.338
I don't know, you know.

00:39:23.698 --> 00:39:27.261
I feel like the closing shift wasn't all that too scary.

00:39:27.501 --> 00:39:28.282
We made drinks.

00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:29.042
I like that.

00:39:29.262 --> 00:39:31.124
So we should be okay this time, right?

00:39:32.104 --> 00:39:34.466
Ruffians, I don't know.

00:39:34.887 --> 00:39:38.529
We might not need you to hold our paw this time.

00:39:38.669 --> 00:39:38.990
Maybe.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.391
I think maybe we'll be okay.

00:39:41.392 --> 00:39:44.155
But please be there for us, okay?

00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:47.459
We'll show you that we're strong, guys.

00:39:47.499 --> 00:39:48.660
Thumbnail TV-8.

00:39:49.862 --> 00:39:51.243
BAU BAU!

00:39:51.444 --> 00:39:54.147
And take another look at our schedule.

00:39:54.207 --> 00:39:55.889
De-den!

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.914
Well, on Wednesday we're gonna be starting the morning with

00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:01.788
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:02.428
But!

00:40:02.828 --> 00:40:04.829
It's not just FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:07.989
We're gonna be streaming three times a day!

00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:09.070
Three times!

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:18.952
We're sharing our morning together, and then in the afternoon, we're gonna be joining some of our Holo EN Senpai and Advent members together in Party Animals!

00:40:19.212 --> 00:40:20.012
I'm excited!

00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:22.532
Yeah, we're gonna be battling it out there together.

00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:24.213
It's our first time playing that game too, right?

00:40:24.233 --> 00:40:27.253
Yeah, we don't know who's gonna be joining, so it's a surprise.

00:40:27.273 --> 00:40:28.094
It's a surprise.

00:40:29.274 --> 00:40:29.634
And then,

00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:34.016
We're gonna be starting out in Resident Evil 4 Remake.

00:40:34.136 --> 00:40:40.680
You know, morning, afternoon in the middle, and night!

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.920
Three times!

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.380
Right?

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:46.903
It'll definitely be a very fun day, but a busy one.

00:40:46.943 --> 00:40:51.565
So Ruffians, we hope that you'll be able to share your day, some of your time.

00:40:51.966 --> 00:40:53.166
You'll be there for us too.

00:40:53.186 --> 00:40:58.249
It's gonna be very fun, so... BAU BAU!

00:40:59.366 --> 00:41:03.109
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today!

00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:09.534
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:41:09.554 --> 00:41:10.094
Kidokimi!

00:41:10.114 --> 00:41:10.895

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:41:46.612 --> 00:41:49.473
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:51.495
