00:04:58.635 --> 00:04:59.956
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:02.256
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:06.898
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:29.047
I didn't press anything, no!

00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:33.228
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:35.148 --> 00:05:37.629
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.170
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.371
And today, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:47.751
Ruffians!

00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:48.872
Are you ready?

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:49.972
Are you awake?

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:52.414
BAU BAU!

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:57.120
Thank you for joining us for our 120th episode!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.682
BAU BAU!

00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:06.530
BAU BAU is the 120th episode on the 20th of a Japan time.

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:07.371
In Japan.

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:09.874
How is it the 20th in Japan, huh? 20!

00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:18.042
Just a couple minutes ago I was like, how is it the 19th?

00:06:18.102 --> 00:06:19.083
The 20th somewhere.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:23.507
Ruffians, I think more than the majority of you, it's just the 19th.

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:26.910
You have the whole day to get ready for the 20th.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.890
BAU BAU!

00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:38.681
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday and Monday aka FUWAMOCO and hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:54.653
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:54.953 --> 00:06:56.834
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:57.074 --> 00:06:57.654
Hashtag!

00:06:57.674 --> 00:06:59.715
FWMCMORNING!

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:04.057
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:07.658
BAU BAU!

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:09.499
Ruffians!

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:13.641
It's so funny to see more hashtags than BAU BAUs!

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:19.605
BAU BAU!

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:21.267
Thank you!

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:23.349
It's a new week!

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.210
It's a new week!

00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:25.252
I'm so excited!

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:28.736
I couldn't wait to mention!

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.960
My understanding of time is very skewed right now.

00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:35.382
Because we're gonna be breaking the dimensions, right?

00:07:35.402 --> 00:07:35.562
Right!

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:37.483
Cleaning the dimension of time, maybe?

00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:38.103
Yeah!

00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:39.703
Yeah!

00:07:40.103 --> 00:07:40.764
Yeah!

00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:45.745
hololive English second concept breaking dimension coming up very soon!

00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:48.486
We're so excited for that!

00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:48.806
But!

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:49.407
But what?

00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:59.530
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:12.301
If you wanna see what it is.

00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:14.081
Okay, well.

00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:14.741
De-den!

00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:20.023
Pero looks pretty happy here, no?

00:08:20.803 --> 00:08:22.063
Well, of course!

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:25.624
You know, because he's all buddy-buddy with the Ruffians, right?

00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:28.325
Wake that smile off your face, Pero!

00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:30.865
That should be all, Sotty.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:31.786
Right!

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:40.245
Although, he does kind of look cute so happy like that, you know?

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:41.767
Maybe.

00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:43.389
Why Ruffians?

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:47.193
Because you treat him like that, but he's nasty, okay?

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:51.918
He only knows that he can use you for pudding, Ruffians.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.101
Yes, he's just using you for pudding.

00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:54.661
Okay.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.140
Don't let him use you like that.

00:08:58.481 --> 00:08:58.821
I don't know.

00:08:58.841 --> 00:08:59.701
He loves us.

00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:02.522
No, he only loves you because you have pudding!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.763
But yeah... He's nasty.

00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:07.823
Treat him like he's nasty, okay?

00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:08.563
Come on.

00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:11.164
But... I don't know what he's making.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:12.884
Kind of like a smile like this.

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:16.105
Maybe... It's okay to leave him like that.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.066
This just... Right there.

00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:19.126
Leave him like that.

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:20.787
Okay, right there.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:21.567
Right there, okay?

00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:23.467
He's not doing anything bad, right?

00:09:23.607 --> 00:09:24.068
Yeah!

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:25.008
For now at least.

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:27.476
You don't have pudding.

00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:30.078
That's because he's already taken it from you.

00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:33.020
You just didn't know.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.302
It's too bad.

00:09:37.183 --> 00:09:38.283
It's too bad.

00:09:38.323 --> 00:09:43.347
But, maybe, maybe, Pero looks like you have a good head pot here, maybe?

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:44.588
Maybe.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.443
BAU BAU!

00:09:50.463 --> 00:09:51.163
Be careful, Ruffians.

00:09:51.203 --> 00:09:52.464
Be careful, okay?

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:58.126
FUWAMOCO, we have some super happy news for you!

00:09:58.706 --> 00:10:07.929
Wow, just at the beginning of the month for our first anniversary, FUWAMOCO, we released our first original song, Born to be BAURO!

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:11.451
And it just reached 400,000 views on YouTube!

00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:13.231
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:14.792
Thank you!

00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:18.463
I'm so happy!

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:20.044
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:27.126
I know that probably for a lot of Ruffians and adventricks out there, maybe you've heard it for the first time just the other day.

00:10:27.146 --> 00:10:30.226
Yeah, during our 3D debut!

00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:31.947
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:36.808
We hope that you like it a lot and that you listen to it many times over!

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:43.370
But for maybe some Ruffians that you're just hearing about this song, FUWAMOCO released an original song today for the first time.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.030
Wow!

00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.228
We haven't released it today. You just heard about it today.

00:10:48.702 --> 00:10:51.024
Well, this song is written by PandaBoY!

00:10:51.324 --> 00:10:54.205
He's a composer that's done a bunch of songs for hololive before.

00:10:54.546 --> 00:10:55.966
Maybe, you know, Blue Clapper?

00:10:56.006 --> 00:11:01.630
But PandaBoY's also written so many songs for our favorite idol groups as well.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.673
So we're really happy that our first official song is PandaBoY's song!

00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:10.395
And you know, it's a song that's very active, very funny, dancing, yelling.

00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:11.675
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:30.963 --> 00:11:36.828
You know, I know that we were talking about originally that we like all the lyrics really all equally.

00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:46.457
But recently, I think one of the lyrics that stands out in this song to me is I really like the kimi no zettai mikata BAUDORU desu.

00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:48.018
We'll always be on your side.

00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:49.760
BAUDORU!

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.501
I really like that lyric.

00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:52.863
We're rooting for you.

00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:54.284
We're always on your side.

00:11:54.304 --> 00:11:55.705
We're cheering for you.

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:57.326
We're here for you, Ruffians.

00:11:58.087 --> 00:12:01.629
You know it.

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:04.691
Ruffians, please continue to listen to Mocchio!

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.753
You like the rap part where Fuwawa is like, no!

00:12:07.773 --> 00:12:08.493
The hex time.

00:12:08.573 --> 00:12:10.915
I don't know what's rap, really.

00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:18.625
Thank you Ruffians!

00:12:19.726 --> 00:12:27.989
And I know there's been a lot of Ruffians practicing, you know, we did the hauls before FUWAMOCO Morning and doing our after parties.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.511
Thank you for practicing a lot too!

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:38.294
We hope that you know BAURO is something that we can enjoy lots and lots for many years to come together, Ruffians!

00:12:39.034 --> 00:12:40.215
And, you know...

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:42.936
It's a really huge loft to go on.

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:48.900
But you know, one day, we really hope that it can reach one million views.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.481
Yeah.

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.622
The Lumina Watchers.

00:12:51.662 --> 00:12:53.043
The Lumina Watchers.

00:12:53.903 --> 00:12:57.005
And Ruffians, if you haven't watched the video, go watch it!

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:57.866
It's so cute!

00:12:58.066 --> 00:12:59.227
It's so cute.

00:12:59.527 --> 00:13:00.347
Super cute!

00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:03.990
And we played with low poly FUWAMOCO too!

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.371
And amazing illustrations by Sasaki-san!

00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:06.771
Yeah!

00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:08.232
Please go take a look!

00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:08.433
Yeah!

00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:18.855
BAU BAU!

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:22.356
You know, just the other day... Advent!

00:13:22.856 --> 00:13:27.657
We had our CD collab all together!

00:13:27.777 --> 00:13:29.198
BAU BAU!

00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:31.278
Did you watch it?

00:13:31.338 --> 00:13:33.558
It was such a big day for us!

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:34.799
It was so busy!

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:39.022
What did you think, Ruffians?

00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.784
It was great!

00:13:40.824 --> 00:13:42.106
Perfect!

00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:43.667
We're so happy.

00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:46.330
We had so much fun all together.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.413
We're just being our normal selves.

00:13:50.034 --> 00:13:52.556
But it's always fun all together with Ruffians.

00:13:52.716 --> 00:13:53.457
It's just how it is.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.122
The pon-de-ring challenge is over!

00:13:59.162 --> 00:14:01.523
They brought out the pon-de-rings for us!

00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:04.145
We almost cried because we were so happy to be able to do this!

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:07.006
We have an idea of it when they're like, bring out the kittens!

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:07.387
Right!

00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:12.109
And they're like, smash the delicious pon-de-rings given to us!

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:18.293
I don't know, I was just like... We still fought over one, huh?

00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:20.815
Yeah, it didn't quite work out.

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.456
But it was so much fun.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:27.677
The donut challenge was really hard though.

00:14:27.697 --> 00:14:30.898
We were kind of doing everything on our own, huh?

00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:32.919
Everybody else had an easy job.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:33.439
Team effort.

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:34.999
Team effort.

00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:38.881
Shiori kind of helped hold them up in the back, right?

00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:39.061
Yeah.

00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:42.722
Yeah, and you know we sung Rebellion for the first time.

00:14:42.742 --> 00:14:42.822
Yeah!

00:14:43.202 --> 00:14:44.723
Sirens too.

00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:46.303
What'd you think of the choreography, huh?

00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:47.243
Yeah, right?

00:14:47.664 --> 00:14:48.324
All for you.

00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:53.469
It was so fun being able to dance with all of our friends together!

00:14:53.549 --> 00:15:00.818
I really loved the part, you know, I think it's the last chorus when we all turn into the circle and we do the chorus part of Rebellion.

00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:01.619
Yeah!

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:05.163
You know we get to all look at each other and smile and stuff.

00:15:05.464 --> 00:15:08.187
And you know in Rebellion when we go into the single line we go

00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:12.468
I know that I can still be... Yeah, the horizontal line.

00:15:12.488 --> 00:15:13.108
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:17.750
Yeah, that part too is always like... FUWAMOCO, don't cry!

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.650
Don't cry!

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.090
FUWAMOCO.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.151
And we also used the KINJI letter to add something together!

00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:25.012
Yeah, we surprised!

00:15:25.612 --> 00:15:36.303
FUWAMOCO, we are so happy because Kimi no Naito Asobi was a song that we used to sing before we even started learning Japanese!

00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:38.866
So we were just like... Whatever we thought we'd write.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.214
The song selection is amazing!

00:15:46.274 --> 00:15:47.715
I'm so happy!

00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:50.457
But Kinjirareta Asobi is such a hard song too.

00:15:50.497 --> 00:15:53.979
We really did our best to practice a lot as well.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.662
The sudden zombies too.

00:16:00.883 --> 00:16:03.504
Why does it have to be zombies, Ruffians?

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:04.325
I don't know why.

00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:07.339
Eyes on me.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.964
I have my own gnome this time!

00:16:10.024 --> 00:16:10.886
Gnome!

00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:11.327
Gnome!

00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:12.048
My gnome!

00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:13.170
Oh my god.

00:16:13.711 --> 00:16:14.854
I saw, I saw.

00:16:17.431 --> 00:16:20.613
You know, some comment later on being, why do they have gnomes?

00:16:22.154 --> 00:16:23.015
Excuse me!

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.716
It's my gnome!

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:27.238
Hello, my gnome!

00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:31.841
That was for my first, like, two club.

00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:33.782
Was that our first club altogether?

00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:35.423
I think so.

00:16:35.523 --> 00:16:37.124
After our debut club.

00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:38.065
Yeah.

00:16:38.545 --> 00:16:41.307
And Nerissa got so mad at you, Moco-chan.

00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:43.949
She's like, get rid of the gnome!

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:44.970
My gnome!

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.292
It's my gnome!

00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:53.335
Where the gnome comes from, please tick that out too.

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:55.116
It's this gnome, ticked out!

00:16:55.256 --> 00:16:56.757
It's so funny!

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:58.778
Mama put Biboo's gnome part too.

00:16:58.838 --> 00:17:01.820
Mama put Biboo's gnome part out too, guys.

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:10.211
You know, I think there's a lot of different things to look at on Twitter.

00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:11.192
Adventrix, Bijou.

00:17:11.212 --> 00:17:11.813
Look at this!

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:12.453
Look at that!

00:17:12.473 --> 00:17:15.637
I think you should watch it again because, you know, it's silly things.

00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:20.663
You know, Nerissa and I dancing for Rebellion together!

00:17:20.703 --> 00:17:22.185
We're in the freestyle part!

00:17:23.686 --> 00:17:24.946
It's so much fun!

00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:26.007
I don't know what we're doing.

00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:27.227
It's too silly.

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:29.107
It's too mean.

00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:30.148
It's just like, oh!

00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:30.968
It's the worst!

00:17:31.408 --> 00:17:31.648
Oh!

00:17:32.368 --> 00:17:33.328
Let's do it!

00:17:33.948 --> 00:17:37.209
It's just so many silly things like that, you know?

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:42.310
It's sort of funny, cause... It's probably just an us thing.

00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:48.152
But, I feel like... There's a lot of pressure on us.

00:17:48.212 --> 00:17:49.652
Like, almost like a stress.

00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:50.872
Of FUWAMOCO.

00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:53.073
Because, you know, I feel like...

00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:56.329
Everyone's like, FUWAMOCO!

00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:57.631
They're the twins!

00:17:57.651 --> 00:17:59.415
I want them to be twins!

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.397
I want them to sing!

00:18:00.597 --> 00:18:02.340
Yeah, whatever your ideal twin is.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.144
We talked about it before, Ruffians, but...

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:06.319
We don't try to sync.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.441
We just... We just FUWAMOCO!

00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:16.764
So I feel like for a 3D debut, there's more pressure because you want to see us sync our movements.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.365
You want to see the twins, you know?

00:18:19.585 --> 00:18:21.466
Like you want to see a tiger roar, right?

00:18:21.566 --> 00:18:22.387
Yeah, yeah!

00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:24.287
It's a tiger, you want to see it roar, right?

00:18:24.327 --> 00:18:26.789
Yeah, you want to see the twins sync, right?

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:29.670
But we're not trying to do that so that... No!

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:33.493
The Tigers won!

00:18:33.533 --> 00:18:34.794
What was this?

00:18:48.748 --> 00:18:55.313
We did the thing that everybody was hoping for!

00:18:55.354 --> 00:18:57.435
It wasn't on purpose!

00:18:57.475 --> 00:19:01.459
We didn't even know that we did that!

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:04.822
Ruffians, you need to use your brain, okay?

00:19:04.902 --> 00:19:07.924
If you think that we're trying to plan when we can think...

00:19:08.825 --> 00:19:10.526
That's way too much effort!

00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:10.586
No!

00:19:10.806 --> 00:19:12.326
That's way too much effort!

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.147
You don't have time for that!

00:19:14.227 --> 00:19:17.808
If you had a twin, you're like, I'm gonna be the twinnest twin with my twin.

00:19:17.828 --> 00:19:18.388
Yeah.

00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:19.348
How would you do that?

00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:20.028
Where do you start?

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:24.710
You're like, I'm gonna spend a lot of time learning to be the twinnest twin with my twin.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.390
No.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.050
Wait, where do you go?

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.650
What do you do?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.211
What's the next step?

00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:28.771
I don't know.

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:30.091
Yeah.

00:19:31.632 --> 00:19:31.772
No.

00:19:31.832 --> 00:19:32.192
Swag.

00:19:32.952 --> 00:19:33.792
Yeah.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:36.693
It doesn't work like that.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.371
We did it, Moco-chan!

00:19:39.431 --> 00:19:42.453
We did it!

00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:43.073
BAU BAU!

00:19:43.093 --> 00:19:43.393
BAU BAU!

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:44.194
Everyone's happy.

00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:45.434
Debut over.

00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:45.834
Good.

00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:46.435
Yeah.

00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:48.696
Is that how it ends, Moco-chan?

00:19:49.577 --> 00:19:54.760
Well, you know, I'm happy also you're able to get to the EN stage!

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.540
Yeah!

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.602
I'm so happy being able to, you know, connect the world and play Parade.

00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:05.526
Especially because those are songs that, two songs in particular that really do mean a lot to us, you know.

00:20:06.126 --> 00:20:14.592
I just think that we'd be able to sing that all together with Advent on the EN stage for our 3D debut!

00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:20.396
Why did the staff have to make sure that the stage is really nice and reflective, FUWAMOCO-chan?

00:20:22.577 --> 00:20:23.438
It's so polished.

00:20:24.058 --> 00:20:26.400
Why is it always so polished, huh?

00:20:31.277 --> 00:20:33.259
Maybe the cell is better in this respect.

00:20:33.579 --> 00:20:35.040
Oh, it's not so shiny.

00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:36.401
Yeah.

00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:38.663
BAU BAU, Ruffians!

00:20:38.703 --> 00:20:43.488
Go check out FUWAMOCO's 3D Advent FUWAMOCO debut!

00:20:43.808 --> 00:20:48.192
You know there'll be lots of things that we're sure that you haven't noticed much of again.

00:20:48.212 --> 00:20:50.333
And see you at our debut too!

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:53.897
FUWAMOCO's 3D debut!

00:20:54.537 --> 00:20:57.219
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:58.400
BAU BAU!

00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:04.117
Wow, you know, like we said, it was a whirlwind.

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:10.406
Because, well, there was a bunch of things that we're doing, but FUWAMOCO are unofficial.

00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:14.795
World Tour continues!

00:21:15.895 --> 00:21:29.919
Maybe some Ruffians already noticed on Twitter, but FUWAMOCO and Advent and Shiori-senpai and Ina-senpai, we're gonna be at Anime Impulse Orange County in California!

00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:30.379
USA!

00:21:30.439 --> 00:21:30.799
MOFA!

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.440
And it's really soon!

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.243
It's really soon at the very beginning of September!

00:21:36.623 --> 00:21:37.304
The very beginning.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.245
Yeah.

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:39.305
Right!

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:40.586
You bought tickets!

00:21:40.626 --> 00:21:41.767
Mama!

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:42.768
Mama!

00:21:42.988 --> 00:21:49.894
Yeah, it's really soon so right now you can apply for meet and greet to be able to meet FUWAMOCO, meet Advent!

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:52.295
Advent-senpai!

00:21:52.856 --> 00:21:55.018
Advent, we're gonna have a panel!

00:21:55.058 --> 00:21:55.658
Yeah!

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.304
Have to look forward to what we do there.

00:21:59.344 --> 00:22:02.792
You never know what kind of mischief we're gonna get up into.

00:22:06.632 --> 00:22:07.833
You hope you can get a ticket?

00:22:07.973 --> 00:22:10.453
I hope so too!

00:22:10.893 --> 00:22:15.394
I feel like we've had so many different stops in our unofficial world tour.

00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:18.535
And this time, you know, it's in America!

00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:24.237
So we hope that you know maybe, Ruffians, if that's nearby to you, that maybe you can come see us!

00:22:24.297 --> 00:22:25.937
Maybe you can meet us!

00:22:26.737 --> 00:22:28.778
At least, if not us, maybe the rest of our friends.

00:22:29.138 --> 00:22:30.659
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:32.240
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:57.520
A mini Rock n' Rawr Party and we had a meet and greet as well!

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.382
It was our first time in Seoul!

00:22:59.402 --> 00:23:00.663
We were really nervous.

00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:04.546
We were really nervous but there were so many Ruffians!

00:23:04.586 --> 00:23:06.508
We were surprised!

00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:08.229
We were so surprised!

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:14.395
We were really happy and we were able to meet so many Ruffians in a meet and greet!

00:23:14.955 --> 00:23:18.576
Yeah, a lot of Moco-chan cosplayers that are super cute too!

00:23:18.616 --> 00:23:21.297
We are so happy!

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.738
We're just really happy to be able to talk.

00:23:23.858 --> 00:23:25.919
You know, be able to communicate!

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:26.999
You spoke Korean!

00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:30.298
Annyeonghaseyo.

00:23:30.378 --> 00:23:32.380
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.143
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo.

00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:38.506
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:39.908
BAU BAU!

00:23:49.917 --> 00:23:53.899
That was our best attempt, Ruffians.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.482
I don't even know if it's correct, but we did it, we're Ruffians!

00:24:01.182 --> 00:24:10.246
Yeah, our Korean's not very good, but we were happy to be able to go and meet some Ruffians there too, so we had lots of fun.

00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:13.147
Hopefully we can go back soon.

00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:17.669
We hope, Ruffians, that we can get close to your hometown.

00:24:17.889 --> 00:24:24.452
We're gonna do our best as the unofficially unofficial FUWAMOCO World Tour continues.

00:24:24.492 --> 00:24:26.232
We're just calling it that.

00:24:27.073 --> 00:24:28.994
BAU BAU!

00:24:31.141 --> 00:24:31.521
FUWAMOCO!

00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:32.442
I'm not a cat!

00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:34.043
I'm a demon dog!

00:24:34.143 --> 00:24:34.563
No!

00:24:34.803 --> 00:24:35.704
All the cats are cute.

00:24:35.804 --> 00:24:38.245
But demon dogs are cute!

00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:39.185
BAU BAU.

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:40.586
Demon dogs are not for that.

00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:41.026
No no no.

00:24:42.492 --> 00:24:47.496
But on the topic of cosplay, there's lots of Moco-chan cosplayers!

00:24:47.556 --> 00:24:50.039
Lots of FUWAMOCO cosplayers recently!

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:50.459
Right!

00:24:50.479 --> 00:24:55.023
It seems like every single day I see new FUWAMOCO cosplayers on Twitter!

00:24:55.043 --> 00:24:57.285
It makes me so happy!

00:24:57.345 --> 00:25:00.728
Everyone having fun with their friends, all your passion!

00:25:00.828 --> 00:25:06.833
Yeah, you know, taking like little videos together, dancing, and just you know, maybe having like a boat party.

00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:11.655
FUWAMOCO Cosplayers.

00:25:34.773 --> 00:25:39.696
It's a FUWAMOCO cosplay group!

00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.597
Can I get your photo?

00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:47.960
FUWAMOCO cosplays, maybe they're a little bit shy, but they won't bow back.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.381
Understandable.

00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:54.904
Sometimes maybe it's a little bit embarrassing.

00:25:54.924 --> 00:25:56.084
A bit overwhelming.

00:25:58.925 --> 00:26:01.147
I think her eyes FUWAMOCO-en!

00:26:01.668 --> 00:26:02.689
If we can ask.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.211
You don't have to do a loud BAU BAU.

00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:05.431
No.

00:26:05.852 --> 00:26:06.993
You can do a quiet BAU BAU.

00:26:07.013 --> 00:26:07.934
A quiet BAU BAU.

00:26:07.974 --> 00:26:09.115
But a friendly.

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:10.676
Yeah, I know you!

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:11.277
BAU BAU.

00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:13.939
But that would make us really happy!

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.282
So if you know somebody BAU BAUs at you.

00:26:20.113 --> 00:26:22.016
Oh, they got super happy!

00:26:22.818 --> 00:26:23.339
I know.

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:24.821
They might be shy.

00:26:25.162 --> 00:26:25.843
I understand.

00:26:25.923 --> 00:26:32.654
And you know, Ruffians, if you see FUWAMOCO cosplayers and you BAU BAU at them and they don't BAU BAU back, that's fine, okay?

00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:33.796
You know?

00:26:34.437 --> 00:26:34.557
Yeah.

00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:38.212
Don't worry about it.

00:26:39.152 --> 00:26:44.214
We'll be excited to BAU BAU lots and lots of Ruffians!

00:26:45.454 --> 00:26:47.755
BAU BAU!

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:52.297
And other interesting news Ruffians!

00:26:52.897 --> 00:26:58.579
This may be a little bit of a silly one, but the hololive homepage has been updated!

00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:00.700
The talent page!

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:07.583
Now, all of Advent, instead of being live TV, we are now all there, officially in 3D!

00:27:07.923 --> 00:27:12.005
It's just like the other years at FUN!

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:15.507
BAU BAU!

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:20.249
Yeah, we officially are feeling like members of hololive now.

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:21.390
Members, full-fledged members!

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.591
Yeah, cause you know, FUWAMOCO has always kinda been a little funny there.

00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:35.276
But it really means a lot to us because Ruffians, I don't know if we ever told you, but we remember when we had just debuted.

00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:37.977
You know, like just, just, just debuted.

00:27:37.997 --> 00:27:41.179
We would just stare at the whole page.

00:27:41.499 --> 00:27:42.459
Yeah, at the talent page.

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:44.200
The talent page is like, yeah.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.381
That's me.

00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:46.362
That's me there.

00:27:46.402 --> 00:27:47.304
That's me there.

00:27:47.324 --> 00:27:48.725
I just didn't disbelieve.

00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:51.869
And now, what happened?

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.912
Why am I here, huh?

00:27:54.453 --> 00:27:55.514
And now we're on there.

00:27:55.534 --> 00:27:56.996
It's ED!

00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:58.197
It's ED!

00:27:58.638 --> 00:28:00.921
That feeling's still kind of there, right?

00:28:02.763 --> 00:28:04.624
But it means a lot to us.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:08.227
We're just so happy to be here, Ruffians.

00:28:08.267 --> 00:28:09.548
Thank you so, so much!

00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:24.941
And you know, FUWAMOCO, we're going to continue to continue to be super ambitious and fluffy and fluffy and reach for the moon in everything we do while also protecting your smile, too.

00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:25.382
BAU BAU!

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.892
Hi Fuwawa LOL!

00:28:33.273 --> 00:28:33.713
Hey!

00:28:34.093 --> 00:28:36.876
Well, you know why I'm messing up my words.

00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:46.926
Because just earlier today, we just finished streaming Aqua-senpai's Visual Novel Aquarium for over 13 hours.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.690
Yeah, we did it all together, Ruffians!

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.252
We finally did it before FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:55.272 --> 00:28:56.472
13 hours!

00:28:56.853 --> 00:29:00.795
I love you say 13 hours, we mean 13 hours!

00:29:01.035 --> 00:29:04.498
We took one 5 minute break and one 30 minute break.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:06.701
Yeah!

00:29:06.941 --> 00:29:10.323
You're still sleepy?

00:29:10.423 --> 00:29:11.484
BAU BAU!

00:29:11.945 --> 00:29:12.645
You're here?

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:14.286
That's amazing though!

00:29:14.687 --> 00:29:17.629
Yeah, and Fuwawa, I read a lot, right?

00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:19.090
Yeah!

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.313
I do my best, but also there's a couple of words that got a little bit funny here and there.

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:26.095
It's difficult and the word wrap wasn't working.

00:29:26.695 --> 00:29:27.796
It's a little bit funny.

00:29:28.317 --> 00:29:29.317
I was thinking.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:39.543
But it was such a fun game, really heartwarming, touching, a little bit bittersweet.

00:29:39.563 --> 00:29:45.666
But we are so happy to be able to play Aqua-senpai's visual novel because it means so much to us.

00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:49.848
It gives respect to Aqua-senpai.

00:29:50.148 --> 00:29:53.010
Right now, Ruffians, we have two different

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.332
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:08.783 --> 00:30:09.143
No!

00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:10.084
It was not!

00:30:10.364 --> 00:30:13.985
And the second one after that, to the end, is about 4 hours.

00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:19.468
That one's about 4 hours, but that is an archive that will last up until August 28th.

00:30:20.188 --> 00:30:24.590
Right now you know special permissions with Aqua-senpai's graduation.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.812
So the second part, the final part of the game, that archive is not gonna stay there forever.

00:30:29.832 --> 00:30:32.173
It's just for a few days, okay?

00:30:32.253 --> 00:30:34.855
It'll be there until August 28th, JST.

00:30:35.075 --> 00:30:35.595
After that,

00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:37.195
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:38.556
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:31:06.042 --> 00:31:14.527
FUWAMOCO, our big big dream is to have our own visual novel come out to produce it too, just like Aqua-senpai did this one.

00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:19.230
But when we asked her, you know, why did you want to release a game like this?

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.411
She said, you know, she wanted to have something that lasts forever.

00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:24.853
And I think that's very beautiful.

00:31:25.573 --> 00:31:33.761
Also, hopefully you know, maybe one day we can have something similar just like Aqua-senpai has aquarium too.

00:31:34.221 --> 00:31:35.262
We are so happy!

00:31:35.302 --> 00:31:36.943
Thank you Ruffians!

00:31:36.983 --> 00:31:39.306
It was an intense 13 hours!

00:31:39.466 --> 00:31:40.427
But it was so much fun!

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:41.027
We did it!

00:31:41.047 --> 00:31:42.689
Thank you!

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.251
Please get a good rest soon.

00:31:45.271 --> 00:31:46.592
We will too.

00:31:48.514 --> 00:31:50.357
BAU BAU!

00:31:51.078 --> 00:31:55.243
And next, we have our Doggie of the Day!

00:31:55.404 --> 00:32:00.651
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Bailey!

00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:02.076
Really?

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:03.017
She's so cute!

00:32:03.037 --> 00:32:03.217
She's 12!

00:32:03.617 --> 00:32:05.178
Yeah!

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:08.701
It's just her birthday just a little while ago.

00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.863
Happy birthday, baby!

00:32:10.923 --> 00:32:12.164
Happy birthday!

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:14.246
Look at that tongue.

00:32:14.686 --> 00:32:15.847
And look her eyes.

00:32:15.987 --> 00:32:16.147
Yeah.

00:32:16.207 --> 00:32:16.748
She's such a cutie.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:17.989
She's so happy.

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:19.490
And look at the tummy.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:20.811
I want to rub the tummy.

00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.412
I want to rub the neck area.

00:32:22.653 --> 00:32:23.073
So cute.

00:32:23.133 --> 00:32:24.014
How does Bailey BAU BAU?

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.422
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:32:48.615 --> 00:32:48.935
Wow.

00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:51.036
BAU BAU!

00:32:51.096 --> 00:32:55.917
Biou is such a lovely girl.

00:32:56.577 --> 00:32:59.138
She might move a little bit slower now, you know.

00:32:59.158 --> 00:33:01.698
She just had her first birthday and all.

00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:05.459
But that's not stopping her from any walks, you know.

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:06.900
You go Biou!

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.060
BAU BAU!

00:33:13.021 --> 00:33:15.542
Bailey looks like Garibaldi!

00:33:15.802 --> 00:33:16.423
A little bit.

00:33:16.443 --> 00:33:17.643
Like a bigger Garibaldi.

00:33:17.663 --> 00:33:18.904
Like four Garibaldis together.

00:33:18.924 --> 00:33:20.424
Four Garibaldis in one.

00:33:20.504 --> 00:33:21.305
That's Bailey.

00:33:25.026 --> 00:33:25.807
Well, next.

00:33:26.207 --> 00:33:29.388
Ruffians, you've been getting those paws going.

00:33:29.748 --> 00:33:32.630
Let's take a look at... Today I went for a walk.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.410
We have De-den!

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.092
Today I went on a walk.

00:33:39.498 --> 00:33:40.879
Mushroom hunting!

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.722
Mushroom hunting together with you!

00:33:45.602 --> 00:33:47.424
I'm envious.

00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:50.005
It's too bad that you didn't find the mushrooms you wanted.

00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:53.088
It's okay, just going on a nice walk in the forest is super nice.

00:33:53.588 --> 00:33:54.769
Maybe you found something.

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:56.090
Some other mushrooms!

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.031
Maybe some cool sticks or something.

00:33:58.051 --> 00:33:59.532
Other stuff.

00:33:59.752 --> 00:34:02.594
It looks like you still had a super fun time though.

00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:05.456
And you took us along with you too!

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:06.817
I wanna go mushroom hunting.

00:34:08.578 --> 00:34:11.699
Yeah, we wanna go!

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:18.002
I wanna go with Senpai.

00:34:18.082 --> 00:34:20.923
I don't know if they wanna go.

00:34:21.003 --> 00:34:22.483
I don't know if they wanna go either.

00:34:22.503 --> 00:34:24.704
But it's a couple months away from now, right?

00:34:24.844 --> 00:34:27.085
Fall time is generally the time.

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.106
Maybe we can...

00:34:31.725 --> 00:34:33.426
Follow in your tracks.

00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.407
Rope some senpai together with us.

00:34:35.427 --> 00:34:37.268
Take them into the woods.

00:34:37.288 --> 00:34:38.509
Get some mushrooms.

00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:39.150
BAU BAU!

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:44.193
Oh my god, you had such a good time!

00:34:44.313 --> 00:34:45.914
BAU BAU!

00:34:45.934 --> 00:34:48.435
Hopefully it was a good experience, right?

00:34:48.495 --> 00:34:49.916
Yeah, at least no poison.

00:34:52.689 --> 00:34:55.771
And next, we have a Question of the Day!

00:34:55.792 --> 00:34:57.673
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:00.796
Good morning FUWAMOCO!

00:35:00.876 --> 00:35:02.237
Good morning!

00:35:02.298 --> 00:35:04.039
I have a question for you.

00:35:04.299 --> 00:35:05.921
I know you're very good at Japanese.

00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:07.042
Thank you.

00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:11.126
But I don't know if you have Japanese language certification.

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:12.567
Do you have one?

00:35:14.268 --> 00:35:15.168
We do!

00:35:15.248 --> 00:35:18.529
We have a Japanese Language Proficiency Test.

00:35:18.569 --> 00:35:20.429
JLPT N2.

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:24.450
It's the second highest for maybe some FUWAMOCO fans that aren't so familiar with us.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:31.391
But we got it many many many many many many many many so long ago that we forgot what it was.

00:35:31.771 --> 00:35:39.773
And we just haven't really been able to study seriously or play enough visual novels to kind of just take the final level yet.

00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:46.081
Yeah. And you know that taking the N1 is even on our goals list. It's on our goals list!

00:35:46.121 --> 00:35:46.622
Yeah!

00:35:46.682 --> 00:35:58.334
But it's seriously tricky, Ruffians. It's seriously difficult. Yeah, even, you know, Japanese natives, they have a hard time passing it. So, maybe, we can study together with you, Ruffians. Yeah!

00:35:58.474 --> 00:36:02.679
And then, we can pass it all together. One day. Yeah, maybe.

00:36:03.182 --> 00:36:04.644
Yeah, everyone. It's hard, yeah.

00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:07.649
You have to seriously, seriously study.

00:36:07.669 --> 00:36:10.012
You can't just be like, I'm gonna wing it!

00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:10.774
No, no, no.

00:36:10.814 --> 00:36:13.277
We gotta study.

00:36:13.297 --> 00:36:14.399
We have to be serious.

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:15.681
And haven't been serious.

00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:18.505
BAU BAU!

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:23.210
Ruffians, you know, do your best learning Japanese too.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:30.632
And you know, if you're still an early level, taking the JLPT can always be a really fun way to challenge yourself.

00:36:30.872 --> 00:36:33.553
Just try the N5.

00:36:33.953 --> 00:36:37.394
But really, don't get all too serious about it.

00:36:37.494 --> 00:36:42.456
It's only really helpful once you get down to the N2, N1, N3s.

00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:45.817
Otherwise, it should just be a fun activity.

00:36:46.057 --> 00:36:48.358
A fun activity to challenge yourself, you know.

00:36:49.058 --> 00:36:50.119
It's not that serious.

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:51.280
Do your best, okay, Ruffians?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.041
Okay!

00:36:52.061 --> 00:36:52.781
It costs money, yeah.

00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:53.522
It costs money.

00:36:53.782 --> 00:36:55.123
It's very serious.

00:36:55.503 --> 00:36:56.584
Very serious.

00:36:56.604 --> 00:36:57.925
Just have fun.

00:36:57.945 --> 00:36:58.266
Yeah.

00:36:58.706 --> 00:37:01.248
But thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:37:01.388 --> 00:37:03.330
Please remember to use the hashtag!

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:09.195
Hashtag FWMCMORNING to send us your questions, your doggy updates, your Pero Sightings!

00:37:09.275 --> 00:37:10.576
Pero Sightings.

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:13.038
And also... Your questions!

00:37:13.078 --> 00:37:14.039
They say questions so much.

00:37:14.179 --> 00:37:17.342
That was the first thing you said!

00:37:20.373 --> 00:37:23.634
You're part of FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:28.117
We're always leading, and I know you wanna be a part of FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:29.941
Send stuff.

00:37:32.102 --> 00:37:34.302
BAU BAU!

00:37:35.523 --> 00:37:40.144
Next, we have another stream coming up not too far from now.

00:37:40.284 --> 00:37:42.444
We have... De-den!

00:37:42.464 --> 00:37:44.845
We're gonna be doing some chatting!

00:37:45.005 --> 00:37:47.126
We have so much to talk about.

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.386
Yeah, there's been so many things that have been going on.

00:37:49.426 --> 00:37:51.767
We just haven't really had much of a moment to be able to just...

00:37:53.002 --> 00:37:54.684
It's been so busy.

00:37:55.124 --> 00:37:57.066
So it'll be comfy.

00:37:57.146 --> 00:37:59.148
We can read some superchats.

00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:00.669
Chat about all these different things.

00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:02.371
Listen, I haven't talked about it.

00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:04.113
I saved Haachama-senpai.

00:38:04.733 --> 00:38:05.494
You don't know how.

00:38:05.514 --> 00:38:06.795
You don't know from what.

00:38:07.376 --> 00:38:08.537
But I saved her.

00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:14.128
Yeah, so maybe we'll chat about that.

00:38:14.188 --> 00:38:16.208
Maybe we'll chat about a bunch of different things.

00:38:16.648 --> 00:38:19.089
Hopefully you'll join us, hopefully.

00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:20.850
BAU BAU!

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.270
And a new schedule!

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.191
Yeah, look!

00:38:25.131 --> 00:38:28.152
Well, you know Moco-chan kinda had a little bit of a migraine.

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:31.653
A little bit of a migraine!

00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:33.474
A little bit!

00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:37.535
And actually, once Moco-chan's migraine was better, I got a headache.

00:38:39.163 --> 00:38:41.046
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.

00:38:41.066 --> 00:38:42.108
It happened, okay.

00:38:42.428 --> 00:38:44.952
So the Rock n' Rawr Party that we weren't able to do!

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:47.976
Well, we're forcing it into our schedule!

00:38:47.996 --> 00:38:48.417
Tuesday!

00:38:48.437 --> 00:38:52.162
It's gonna be on Tuesday at 6pm PT.

00:38:52.303 --> 00:38:53.765
I hope you can make it on-

00:38:54.085 --> 00:38:55.927
We hope that you'll be there, Ruffians!

00:38:56.387 --> 00:39:01.972
Because we want to be able to sing together with you no matter what before breaking dimensions!

00:39:02.412 --> 00:39:06.115
This is hololive's only song before breaking dimensions!

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:11.039
So we're breaking the schedule and we're putting the Rock n' Rawr Party right in there!

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.101
And that's why it's Frog Detective.

00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:15.102
What is this game, Frog Detective?

00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:17.284
And why is it at 430 in the morning?

00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:20.307
It's at 430 AM in the morning because...

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:22.188
We need to become a detective.

00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:24.029
A frog detective sounds very cute.

00:39:24.169 --> 00:39:27.671
Investigation for the whole bingo.

00:39:27.972 --> 00:39:29.332
Frog detective.

00:39:29.753 --> 00:39:35.837
So there's some puzzles and it'd be very helpful, Ruffians, if you decided to wake up at 4.30am and help us with the puzzles.

00:39:35.857 --> 00:39:39.119
We are not good at puzzles and we need to clear it before FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:42.966
But if you want to sleep, that makes sense too.

00:39:43.807 --> 00:39:47.331
And that's why- Oh!

00:39:47.572 --> 00:39:49.834
FUWAMOCO's being really silly again!

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:52.217
It makes sense, it's not a mistake.

00:39:53.138 --> 00:39:56.963
But then Thursday, we're rushing to get a bunch of homework done!

00:39:57.203 --> 00:39:58.424
Because there's so much homework.

00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:01.548
Breaking Dimensions!

00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:04.192
Friday we have a big rehearsal day!

00:40:04.252 --> 00:40:07.758
This Saturday and Sunday we have Breaking Dimensions!

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.802
Our first concert!

00:40:10.902 --> 00:40:12.404
We need to practice more.

00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:13.065
Right.

00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:15.706
There's so much to do in Ruffians.

00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:20.347
But breaking the mentions is hololive England's second concert!

00:40:20.407 --> 00:40:23.849
It's in New York at the King's Theatre for two days!

00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:30.131
The 24th and 25th if New York sounds a little bit far for you which makes sense probably for the majority of Ruffians.

00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:35.273
You can join us by watching online on SPW and on Sponge!

00:40:35.413 --> 00:40:38.334
Or E+, you can get your digital streaming tickets there!

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:39.894
Get your tickets, do not forget!

00:40:39.994 --> 00:40:41.255
Don't forget Ruffians!

00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:46.177
It's probably not the same now, but you know, in the past sometimes things get overloaded.

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:50.160
So it's better if you buy your ticket in advance.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.041
We recommend getting it early.

00:40:52.081 --> 00:41:00.745
And especially, you know, if you want to see FUWAMOCO live in concert on the big stage, that's the number one to make sure you know that you can support us.

00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:02.166
The number one thing you can do.

00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:07.649
So please, please stay as long as we did to see our concert debut service.

00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:08.449
Did you buy it on?

00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:09.770
I hope you find out.

00:41:12.631 --> 00:41:14.193
Good luck with it!

00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:15.133
BAU BAU!

00:41:16.935 --> 00:41:19.297
