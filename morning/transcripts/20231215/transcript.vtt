00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.100
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:14.120
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.075
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:24.700
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.510
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.351
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:33.833
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:33.913 --> 00:05:38.054
Today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:40.135
Ruffians, good morning!

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:41.596
Good morning!

00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:45.958
Thank you for joining us today for our 57th episode!

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:46.858
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:50.440
BAU BAU!

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.920
I can't believe it's the 57th.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.461
I thought it was the 56th episode today.

00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:55.702
You were very confused.

00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:58.003
And Moco-chan was like, no.

00:05:58.023 --> 00:05:58.283
No, it's 57!

00:05:58.323 --> 00:05:59.384
The other day was 56!

00:05:59.884 --> 00:06:00.444
Yeah.

00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:02.905
It goes too fast, Ruffians.

00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:13.030
Well, for any Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.810
A.K.A.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.770
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.131
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:18.193
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:23.738

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.581

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:34.208
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.150
BAU BAU!

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.531
It's a good day, Ruffians!

00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:41.311
A great day!

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:42.652
End of the week!

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:46.254
End of the week, a sign of a very fun weekend!

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:49.856
Well, did we have any Ruffians but Peron?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.671
Let's see!

00:06:55.812 --> 00:06:58.054
De-den!

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.775
What?

00:07:00.155 --> 00:07:00.816
What?

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:02.137
What?

00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:03.338
Is Pero okay?

00:07:03.418 --> 00:07:05.780
This is amazing!

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.340
What?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.242
Pero successfully climbed Mount Everest?

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:10.503
Is this a vacation?

00:07:11.424 --> 00:07:14.967
Is he going to be okay with the cold temperatures and the elevations?

00:07:17.922 --> 00:07:20.824
Actually, maybe it's not so much of a vacation.

00:07:20.844 --> 00:07:29.290
Cause you know, I heard that it's not really that amazing of a feat anymore, you know?

00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:34.614
There's so many people doing it now, that it's actually really warm up there!

00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:43.441
It looks pretty cold, but... I don't know... Ruffians, do you think you would want to climb Mount Everest one day maybe?

00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:49.956
Actually, I'm kind of surprised that Pero would want to do something like this.

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:55.879
Let me say that he didn't get, like, kidnapped, go up to the mountains or something, you know?

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.119
Kidnapped up to the mountains?

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.260
Does that happen?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.122
Getting kidnapped all the way to the top of Mount Everest?

00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:05.183
I don't know.

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:06.124
I don't think so.

00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:10.069
I don't know, but... Unlikely.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.354
Maybe it's chill, but... There's no Wi-Fi up there, but you know.

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:18.680
Hell great getting Wi-Fi, so... I don't know, maybe that's why they wanted him.

00:08:20.489 --> 00:08:21.570
That's a volcano, not a mountain.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:52.337
Mococo are Ruffians!

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.542
BAU BAU!

00:08:55.602 --> 00:09:01.110
Hopefully Pero can find his way down, but... I don't know, I like the silly faces making.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.572
It's very satisfying.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:05.416
BAU BAU!

00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:09.198
Well, Ruffians!

00:09:09.658 --> 00:09:16.199
There was some details shared about something really exciting coming up.

00:09:16.219 --> 00:09:17.040
FUWAMOCO!

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:24.642
We're gonna be part of hololive's end of the year show, Yukuhoro Kuruhoro!

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:25.322
And us!

00:09:25.462 --> 00:09:27.122
FUWAMOCO, that's us!

00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:30.303
We're gonna be part of the big clip show, the Toritaka!

00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:31.984
It's big!

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:32.644
It's big!

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:50.596
It's the end of the year, you know!

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.077
BAU BAU!

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:53.698
Congratulations!

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:54.238
Thank you!

00:09:54.318 --> 00:09:56.459
I'm really looking forward to it!

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:11.046
Ruffians, you know you can actually submit your favorite clips from the whole entire year as part of the listener submitted category using the YouTube clip function and then sharing them on Twitter with the Toretaka Taiso hashtag.

00:10:12.347 --> 00:10:16.090
So, if you're interested, please try it out, okay?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.793
We'll do our best as members of Advent and hololive English!

00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:21.694
BAU BAU!

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.556
Please do it!

00:10:23.736 --> 00:10:25.858
Okay, there's too many to count, I know.

00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:26.978
I know.

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:34.765
If you have one that really sticks out in your mind... Is there anything that stands out right now, Ruffians?

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:38.227
Give me some FUWAMOCO moments.

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:39.308
Advent moments.

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:46.758
Please say goodbye, okay?

00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:47.138
Bye bye!

00:10:49.026 --> 00:10:49.967
Amazing skills.

00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:53.569
Wow, you know what?

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.091
There's been some other exciting things too.

00:10:56.651 --> 00:10:58.893
Actually, there was a birthday.

00:10:58.913 --> 00:11:00.134
There was!

00:11:00.234 --> 00:11:04.457
There was Oboe-senpai's birthday!

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:10.361
And actually, we are invited to sing together with her!

00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:12.983
We sang a song called Baby Sleeper.

00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:14.706
Yeah!

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:18.528
You know, we're really happy to be able to sing with Hubo-senpai!

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:21.511
But also able to sing a song that we really, really like, too!

00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:22.752
Thank you, sweet Cherry!

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.613
I mean, Hubo-senpai.

00:11:25.094 --> 00:11:25.634
She gets us.

00:11:25.654 --> 00:11:28.296
She gets us, yeah, you know.

00:11:28.436 --> 00:11:35.101
Actually, she shared her new original song, Enta, together with all of us, too!

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:41.706
Yeah, it's part of the new music label, together with hololive and Universal Music Japan, called HoloEN.

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:47.052
Please check it out, Ruffians, if you haven't.

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:48.314
Okay!

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:51.117
I really like Kobo-senpai's music.

00:11:51.157 --> 00:11:56.384
It has a very... Kobo-senpai's sound to it is very different from others.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.326
That sounds like an excuse!

00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:58.327
It's not an excuse!

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:00.069
But I understand what you mean.

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:01.131
It feels very, like...

00:12:01.531 --> 00:12:02.392
Kobo-senpai.

00:12:02.412 --> 00:12:02.892
Maroyaka.

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:04.213
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:04.754
Smooth.

00:12:05.254 --> 00:12:06.615
Smooth!

00:12:06.815 --> 00:12:07.876
Sort of like water.

00:12:10.118 --> 00:12:12.120
Yeah, a nice cup of warm water.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.761
BAU BAU!

00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:19.145
Happy birthday, Kobo-senpai!

00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:28.233
While continuing the music news, actually we had some more senpai release a new original song.

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:31.950
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.391
BAU BAU!

00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:36.112
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo Abyssgard!

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:44.281
I think they do.

00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:45.402
Yeah, that is really good.

00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:47.723
Only the coolest songs, right?

00:12:47.743 --> 00:12:48.243
Yeah, right!

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:50.645
And you know the music video's amazing, too!

00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:50.885
Yeah!

00:12:51.265 --> 00:12:52.365
All fully 3D and everything!

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:53.386
Everything!

00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:54.647
Fire and ice.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:55.087
I know.

00:12:55.427 --> 00:12:58.869
We're really happy that we have this original song together now, too.

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:03.231
Yeah, you know, I feel like everybody's been waiting for such a long time for something like this.

00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:04.631
Right, right.

00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:06.392
Why did it take this long, huh?

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:07.192
Huh?

00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:07.732
Huh?

00:13:07.852 --> 00:13:08.753
I have a complaint.

00:13:09.253 --> 00:13:09.753
What?

00:13:10.513 --> 00:13:12.194
Well, now it's here!

00:13:12.214 --> 00:13:13.814
It's here!

00:13:13.874 --> 00:13:15.995
Not... It's not here today.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.195
It is here today.

00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:21.396
But it was here as in Akari-senpai's channel, not on the FUWAMOCO channel.

00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:22.377
That wouldn't make sense.

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:23.457
It's here.

00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:23.877
Yesterday!

00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:24.777
Yesterday, yesterday.

00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:29.186
Please check it out, okay?

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:31.666
Yeah, it's a really cool song.

00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:33.627
BAU BAU!

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:34.507
It's cool.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:35.288
And hot.

00:13:35.328 --> 00:13:35.808
Fire and ice.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:35.968
Yeah.

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.108
BAU BAU!

00:13:42.662 --> 00:13:48.926
Well, Ruffians, you know FUWAMOCO Morning is not just about sharing music news, you know.

00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:50.027
Oh, well, it's exciting.

00:13:50.047 --> 00:13:51.628
Yeah, that's a lot of music.

00:13:51.648 --> 00:14:00.193
We do have Pero Sightings, too, but actually, it seems like there have been a lot of FUWAMOCO Sightings around the world recently.

00:14:02.615 --> 00:14:04.316
And not just Pero Sightings.

00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:05.897
Not just Pero Sightings.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:13.721
We got reports actually that FUWAMOCO, we are spotted cheering on a wrestling match!

00:14:13.981 --> 00:14:15.763
Look at us there on the side!

00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:17.564
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:17.584 --> 00:14:23.507
You know, BAU BAU means a lot of different things, you know, depending on the situation.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.009
But in this situation, what does it mean?

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.391
BAU BAU is... Smash the opponent!

00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:32.072
Flip them over and grab their arm like that.

00:14:32.152 --> 00:14:33.433
Yeah, that's what it means.

00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:34.593
I don't know what it's called.

00:14:35.053 --> 00:14:36.794
What's a wrestling move, Moco-chan?

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:37.454
Lariat.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.695
Lariat!

00:14:40.196 --> 00:14:43.157
What's the thing where you hold their head and you're like BAU BAU BAU BAU?

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:44.117
Head crunch.

00:14:44.277 --> 00:14:44.758
Head lock!

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.279
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:48.679
BAU BAU!

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.620
What's wrong, Moco-chan?

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.381
If you're not careful, I'm gonna headlock you.

00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:54.655
Is that all you have to say?

00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:56.176
I'll do a lyre.

00:14:58.556 --> 00:14:59.296
Yeah!

00:15:00.097 --> 00:15:00.777
It's pretty cool.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:07.278
You know, hopefully there, the wrestling skills transfer to us for a big fight that we couldn't have one day.

00:15:07.298 --> 00:15:07.978
Right, Ruffians?

00:15:08.058 --> 00:15:10.959
You know, we have the extreme violence.

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:12.559
Yeah, extreme violence.

00:15:12.619 --> 00:15:13.960
Ah, FUWAMOCO wrestling when?

00:15:16.121 --> 00:15:16.441
One day.

00:15:16.481 --> 00:15:17.983
It's part of our goals, right?

00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:18.983
A suplex.

00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:22.386
We'll have to do all the training.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.148
We'll have to train.

00:15:24.448 --> 00:15:25.128
But also!

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:27.370
Not just wrestling.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:32.655
There was a very cute Moco-chan cosplay spotted on TV in the Philippines too!

00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:51.443
BAU BAU!

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:55.568
It makes me feel a bit like a...

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:10.718
Dinosaur.

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:10.958
Dinosaur?

00:16:10.978 --> 00:16:11.839
You're gonna say superstar.

00:16:11.859 --> 00:16:12.199
Superstar!

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:12.759
A superstar dinosaur.

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:13.159
Oh, even better.

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:16.561
We're doing our all so that maybe one day we can come visit you in your country someday too.

00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:17.902
At least we're doing our best right now.

00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:21.964
You know, next week we won't be in the Philippines, but... Go make a fiesta!

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:25.062
We can come visit you in your country someday too!

00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:27.628
At least, we're doing our best, right?

00:16:27.969 --> 00:16:33.201
You know, next week we won't be in the Philippines, but... Go to Malaysia!

00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:34.123
Malaysia!

00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:35.606
Malaysia!

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:35.847
Maybe!

00:16:36.348 --> 00:16:38.533
Maybe one day, Ruffians, you can come visit us!

00:16:40.535 --> 00:16:44.377
Please do again!

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:45.677
BAU BAU!

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:47.058
So happy.

00:16:47.398 --> 00:16:51.299
I wonder when I'll be able to make my Philippine TV debut too.

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:52.180
You can wait.

00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:55.981
Maybe next time, ha?

00:16:56.341 --> 00:16:57.882
Maybe next time.

00:16:59.203 --> 00:17:01.083
Ruffians!

00:17:07.603 --> 00:17:12.185
It's been a little while since you know we had a confession for you.

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:17.928
But, well... You have something you have to say, huh?

00:17:18.168 --> 00:17:21.449
Yeah, I have something that I should share, you know?

00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:22.450
You should!

00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:32.154
You see, you know, Ruffians, as you know, we really like seeing your thoughts and your tweets on Twitter, right?

00:17:32.174 --> 00:17:32.854
Yeah, yeah!

00:17:32.914 --> 00:17:33.795
Is that a confession?

00:17:36.314 --> 00:17:43.480
Basically, you know, FUWAMOCO has been even more crazy than it's usually been for us.

00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:47.324
I don't think, Ruffians, I don't think you really know, and that's okay.

00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:51.828
That's okay, but we've just been doing our best, you know.

00:17:52.348 --> 00:18:01.397
But actually, I was taking a look at some of your tweets while I was in bed, before I fell asleep.

00:18:02.097 --> 00:18:03.878
What happened?

00:18:04.158 --> 00:18:09.800
You know, I started to drift off and accidentally... I liked a few of your tweets.

00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.402
But it was okay!

00:18:13.422 --> 00:18:21.085
You know, because when I woke up, I realized what I did and I was conscious enough to read your message and I did actually really like it!

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.886
So, it was okay.

00:18:24.507 --> 00:18:25.167
Half asleep?

00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:26.448
Not even half asleep.

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:27.028
It happened...

00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:35.134
It was okay, right?

00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:45.758
But... Ruffians... The issue is... Is that... This wasn't the first time Fuwawa did something like this, huh?

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:48.799
No.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.440
One time.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:56.902
Almost added a Twitter profile too.

00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:57.383
Yeah.

00:18:57.463 --> 00:19:02.548
When I woke up, it was asking me if I wanted to save the changes made to my profile.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:04.250
Yeah.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.193
That could've been really bad, huh?

00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:11.657
Not even a sleep tweet.

00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:14.849
In the future though, I'll take measures.

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:18.111
I'll be careful not to look at Twitter too much before bed.

00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:23.195
That way we don't accidentally like tweets half asleep.

00:19:36.713 --> 00:19:38.355
That would be awful, right, Ruffians?

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.518
You wouldn't want us to, like, retweet when we're not awake, okay?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.424
But that just means that you tweet the first thing I see when I wake up, right?

00:19:47.704 --> 00:19:49.626
BAU BAU!

00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:52.009
When you fall asleep, that's when you wake up.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.970
Yeah.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.450
BAU BAU!

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:53.751
BAU BAU!

00:20:01.522 --> 00:20:03.463
It's good to get that off my chest a bit.

00:20:03.483 --> 00:20:04.523
You feel better a bit?

00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:05.163
Yeah.

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:07.463
It's not gonna happen again now that you confessed it.

00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:12.624
I can't promise.

00:20:13.105 --> 00:20:14.105
BAU Moco-chan.

00:20:15.185 --> 00:20:15.985
Ruffians!

00:20:17.486 --> 00:20:18.586
Ruffians!

00:20:21.646 --> 00:20:24.507
Actually, there's something else.

00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:29.148
It's not a confession, but

00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:32.733
It's a bit of a concern.

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:36.014
You know.

00:20:37.635 --> 00:20:39.255
It's the holiday season, right?

00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.236
Right?

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:43.276
Right!

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:54.883
Yeah, and Ruffians, that means Christmas is almost here, right?

00:20:56.264 --> 00:20:58.204
Christmas means Ruffians.

00:20:58.585 --> 00:20:59.545
What does it mean to you?

00:20:59.645 --> 00:20:59.905
Yeah.

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.706
What is Christmas to you?

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.386
Holidays to you?

00:21:03.406 --> 00:21:09.149
I could say, you know, Christmas is... Yummy food!

00:21:10.249 --> 00:21:11.070
Reindeer!

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:18.212
What about... What about... Miniskirt Santas?

00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:19.353
Hi.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.083
That's, that's an important part of the holiday landscape, right?

00:21:25.323 --> 00:21:25.964
Right!

00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:26.945
Right!

00:21:27.525 --> 00:21:31.148
And the other day, Ruffians, you know when we were playing White Album, right?

00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:37.954
Toya was all talking about imagining Yuki in a Santa costume and how cute she would be!

00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:43.238
And then, uh, suddenly he imagined her so hard that we could see her too!

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:44.319
Yeah.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.301
Well, Ruffians!

00:21:49.623 --> 00:21:51.284
Have you not been imagining?

00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:54.666
It doesn't really seem like it.

00:21:55.486 --> 00:21:59.268
I haven't really seen any FUWAMOCO festive pictures or anything.

00:21:59.288 --> 00:22:03.590
Are you glad that Toya beat you?

00:22:04.831 --> 00:22:12.174
Or is it that you don't think that we suit being Santa or bringing cheer and happiness to all the good Ruffians everywhere all across the world?

00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:15.816
What do you say, Ruffians?

00:22:19.622 --> 00:22:20.022
I see!

00:22:20.042 --> 00:22:23.385
That's all.

00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:25.106
That's it.

00:22:25.307 --> 00:22:30.851
I mean, Santa has a bigger tummy than Moco-chan.

00:22:31.071 --> 00:22:36.275
Fluffy and fuzzy, but not fluffy and fuzzy enough to have a beard, you know?

00:22:36.315 --> 00:22:39.538
Please don't imagine me with a big tummy, please!

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:41.239
Yeah, but...

00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:49.943
You know, if you cut out little holes in the hat, then our ears will fit too, so... We could be Santa if we wanted to, right?

00:22:51.683 --> 00:22:51.943
No?

00:22:55.664 --> 00:22:59.845
Well, let's do our best not to think too hard about it, Moco-chan, okay?

00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:05.106
It's concerning, though.

00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:08.367
Well, no, it's not concerning.

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.937
A cute Doggie of the Day!

00:23:14.378 --> 00:23:17.239
Let's go check out who the Doggie of the Day is today.

00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:20.301
Today we have... De-den!

00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:21.802
Bucky!

00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:24.944
Bucky's the Doggie of the Day!

00:23:24.984 --> 00:23:26.705
Bucky sure looks festive.

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:28.626
Very happy, yeah.

00:23:29.106 --> 00:23:34.009
Bucky's freshly bathed and cleaned up on his way back from the groomers.

00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:35.150
Fancy, huh?

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.271
However, this Ruffian says

00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:40.635
He's ready to get himself dirty all over again.

00:23:42.638 --> 00:23:43.219
Bucky.

00:23:43.239 --> 00:23:43.279
Hi.

00:23:44.981 --> 00:23:48.887
What about just saying nice and clean and fluffy and fuzzy hi?

00:23:48.947 --> 00:23:50.769
Right, that's good but...

00:23:52.688 --> 00:23:53.148
Apparently not.

00:23:53.728 --> 00:24:00.711
But also, Bucky's tongue is a little bit big for his head and usually it's sticking out like this!

00:24:02.412 --> 00:24:04.213
It's super cute!

00:24:04.613 --> 00:24:05.573
We love it, Bucky.

00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:06.934
It could be dangerous though.

00:24:07.294 --> 00:24:08.935
Don't get it stuck anywhere, okay?

00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:10.015
No, yeah.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:10.936
Yeah.

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:14.457
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Bucky BAU BAU?

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:21.060
My tongue is normal size so

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:24.496
Pretend that it's really long.

00:24:24.516 --> 00:24:25.317
BAU BAU!

00:24:25.357 --> 00:24:26.217
BAU BAU!

00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:26.937
BAU BAU!

00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:27.517
BAU BAU!

00:24:28.558 --> 00:24:29.698
BAU BAU!

00:24:30.178 --> 00:24:31.558
BAU BAU!

00:24:31.578 --> 00:24:32.218
Like that.

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:34.319
Like that, yeah.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.900
It's so cute.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:44.442
But, you know, Bucky Bucky's a silly little cotton puff with a big tongue and lots of love to share.

00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:55.912
And I'm sure he really loves how much you spoil him, but he also loves to have fun and a part of that fun is getting dirty again too.

00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:58.234
Don't mind it too much, okay?

00:24:58.734 --> 00:25:01.237
BAU BAU!

00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:06.201
And for today's walk we have De-den!

00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:12.767
That's so cool!

00:25:12.807 --> 00:25:15.129
That's so impressive!

00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:20.293
You know, like, spiders are scary and everything, but seeing the webs like this is the best.

00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:21.234
Right!

00:25:22.015 --> 00:25:24.177
Very, very impressive.

00:25:24.637 --> 00:25:26.899
Thank you for sharing that with us!

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:33.305
Actually, you know, whenever we come across a very impressive spider web like this, we also actually...

00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:34.885
Take a photo too.

00:25:35.906 --> 00:25:37.387
You can't just let it be, right?

00:25:37.427 --> 00:25:38.827
You have to get a photo.

00:25:38.847 --> 00:25:39.528
Right.

00:25:39.828 --> 00:25:42.449
Take it from all different angles and everything too.

00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:46.851
But you know, I think we have to say that yours is definitely the best of best.

00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:48.232
It's very mesmerizing.

00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:56.319
Yeah, well, hopefully you're able to free up your mirror before you started driving because I don't think you need that when you're driving.

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:57.760
You can just see the mirror, right?

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.481
Probably.

00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:00.243
Probably for the best.

00:26:00.303 --> 00:26:00.943
Probably.

00:26:01.504 --> 00:26:02.405
BAU BAU!

00:26:02.585 --> 00:26:03.666
Thank you!

00:26:05.846 --> 00:26:08.907
We also received a Question of the Day today.

00:26:09.027 --> 00:26:11.608
We have De-den!

00:26:12.348 --> 00:26:21.571
I was wondering, after your first mini Rock n' Rawr Party, how did it feel to hear the Ruffians cheering in person instead of reading the praise?

00:26:21.891 --> 00:26:28.053
Also, did you do any extra preparation beforehand compared to a normal Rock n' Rawr Party?

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:30.134
It was very very different!

00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:35.742
It's too bad we can't hear your voices regularly, huh?

00:26:56.428 --> 00:27:01.153
But you know, as for prep though, it's not really that different.

00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:08.900
You know, we just thought, what songs that maybe those Ruffians might want to hear there, and you know, what we want to share and say with you to them.

00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:11.563
You know, that sort of thing.

00:27:12.444 --> 00:27:15.106
You know, we want to have as much fun with you as possible!

00:27:15.126 --> 00:27:18.850
So we think about a lot of things when preparing for a rock n' rawr party, you know?

00:27:20.721 --> 00:27:27.768
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your questions, your Doggie of the Day, your Pero Sightings, your scoops too.

00:27:42.352 --> 00:27:46.355
Thank you so much for always being part of us, Ruffians.

00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:48.056
BAU BAU!

00:27:48.096 --> 00:27:48.997
Don't forget.

00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:50.098
Oh, use the hashtag.

00:27:50.618 --> 00:27:54.621
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:27:54.801 --> 00:27:56.122
BAU BAU!
