00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:08.823
BAU BAU!

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.895
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:16.525
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:23.846
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.831
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:32.577
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.597 --> 00:05:32.757
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:37.744
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.067
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:43.151
I definitely wasn't confused there for a moment, Ruffians.

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.493
What?

00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:44.633
What?

00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:45.133
Confused?

00:05:45.153 --> 00:05:47.136
You didn't notice anything, right?

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:49.116
Huh?

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:50.057
I was caught off guard.

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:51.518
It's okay, I'm good.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:52.540
Are you weak, Moco-chan?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.801
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good!

00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:57.885
BAU BAU!

00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:03.230
And today, we're gonna host a FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:09.277
BAU BAU, thank you for joining us for our 147th episode!

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:11.659
BAU BAU!

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:14.462
Caught off guard by what?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:15.663
Is that a misunderstanding?

00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:16.684
I wanna know.

00:06:18.352 --> 00:06:22.381
I thought the order was different.

00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:24.887
I thought... BAU BAU!

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.017
Thank you for joining us for our 146th episode!

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.224
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:32.946
Are you using it?

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:34.249
Here's Moco-chan!

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:35.331
I got confused.

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:56.796
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:56.776 --> 00:06:57.837
But!

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:02.663
But the Ruffians and I saw Ruffians happy to be able to join us today.

00:07:02.703 --> 00:07:03.864
Maybe it's your first time.

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.587
Maybe it's not your first time.

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:06.588
Maybe first time for the year.

00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:09.952
But for the Ruffians that are, you know, maybe forgot.

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:17.581
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short four-night morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:19.103
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:22.567
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.091
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.156
Hope you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:29.757 --> 00:07:34.605
So, please take your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:36.068
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:36.308 --> 00:07:40.114
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:43.840
BAU BAU!

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:44.982
Are you awake now?

00:07:45.283 --> 00:07:46.284
Okay?

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:46.645
Good.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.705
BAU BAU!

00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:51.889
That's not good enough.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:58.681
We gotta start your day off on the right paw, okay?

00:07:58.701 --> 00:07:59.843
BAU BAU!

00:07:59.863 --> 00:08:01.145
You're not awake!

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:02.368
You're not awake!

00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:07.637
What are we gonna do about that, Moco-chan?

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:13.738
However, there has to be a bad part to the day, right, Ruffians?

00:08:13.758 --> 00:08:14.859
It'll spook you weak, okay?

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:17.182
This'll be the worst part of the day today.

00:08:17.202 --> 00:08:17.382
Okay.

00:08:17.922 --> 00:08:18.563
Got it.

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:19.204
Okay.

00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:20.025
Let's get it done with.

00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:22.788
Where was Pero Sighted this time?

00:08:22.808 --> 00:08:29.435
De-den!

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:30.616
Is this a Pero Sighting?

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:32.598
So nice and comfy.

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:33.239
No more.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:34.461
Look at the sky.

00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:37.624
What the hell is there?

00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:40.608
I just wanted to look at the sky, Moco-chan.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.872
Focus on the sky.

00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:48.704
Watching the sunrise together with the Ruffians though.

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:50.829
Ruffians!

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.073
Why do you like Pero so much?

00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:57.803
I don't get it.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:08:59.747
It's nasty!

00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:02.940
Hi.

00:09:02.961 --> 00:09:03.824
Pero Rue.

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:06.175
Why would you choose that Rue?

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:07.541
He's soft.

00:09:07.742 --> 00:09:08.365
Aoshi.

00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:08.445
Hi.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.037
He's like a circle.

00:09:12.097 --> 00:09:13.118
Hi.

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:13.879
He's cool.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.760
He's round.

00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:15.982
He's all muscle.

00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:17.624
My love.

00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:18.766
Hi.

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:22.230
That's some pretty big words there.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.313
But, uh, Ruffians, you're not waking up early.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.435
You know, Ruffians, you're like, oh, I'm not awake.

00:09:26.455 --> 00:09:27.497
You know, it's FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:30.180
If you wanna go see the sunrise, you gotta wake up pretty early.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:36.248
You couldn't wake up that early to be able to go and hang out with Pero and see the sunrise.

00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:37.431
Hi!

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.636
Are you here to have FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:42.101
I don't know, Ruffians, that's kind of funny.

00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:42.201
Huh?

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.380
It's a weird day, but, but, if it was us, Ruffians!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.885
But you wake up early to see the sunrise.

00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:53.747
Huh?

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.019
Watching the sun rise together with FUWAMOCO.

00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:14.132
Are you sure you want to start the day off on the right paw?

00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:19.709
I'm gonna do it anyways.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.673
I'm gonna do it.

00:10:22.693 --> 00:10:28.601
And then the Ruffians will be like, okay, maybe, maybe I'll watch the sunrise together with FUWAMOCO.

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:29.983
We'll teach you hard!

00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:32.527
We're the best sunrise watchers ever!

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:33.909
No, Pero!

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.853
BAU BAU!

00:10:38.756 --> 00:10:47.308
Speaking of watching things, actually Ruffians, there's something even better than the sunrise to watch right now!

00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:54.903
We're happy to share the ice FUWAMOCO with you in the newest episode of hololive!

00:10:55.003 --> 00:10:55.425
BAU BAU!

00:10:56.131 --> 00:11:06.045
We're super happy and this time we're together with Poruru-oneechan and want to go for a nice spring picnic.

00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:07.267
Look at us there.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.311
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:14.897
Maybe there's some Ruffians wondering what is hologram?

00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:20.265
Hologram is a weekly hololive animation show that gets uploaded to the official

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:32.505
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:41.460
Have a howl of a day!

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.337
But you know, we're not gonna tell you what happened.

00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:52.205
You can go check it out with your own two eyes on the hololive official YouTube account.

00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:54.809
And there's a link on our community page as well.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.133
You know, makes it extra simple.

00:11:58.314 --> 00:12:01.900
But you know, hololive is cool and awesome.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.807
But there's something actually a little silly.

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:09.415
Because Moco-chan!

00:12:09.435 --> 00:12:19.329
I realize Moco-chan made a little mistake.

00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:19.750
Ruffians!

00:12:21.552 --> 00:12:30.784
Even my 3D Senpai noticed!

00:12:30.804 --> 00:12:31.745
She tweeted about it!

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:35.250
You know... I misread it!

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.954
I misread the kanji in the script!

00:12:38.454 --> 00:12:40.697
How was I supposed to know, huh?

00:12:41.618 --> 00:12:44.021
How else was I supposed to read it?

00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:44.442
Okay!

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.465
Look!

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:46.905
Look!

00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:47.266
Okay!

00:12:48.147 --> 00:12:49.028
It says...

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:50.351
Koo-ame.

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:50.852
Koo-ame!

00:12:50.892 --> 00:12:54.880
That's how you read the kanji!

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.503
Koo-ame!

00:12:57.365 --> 00:13:00.170
It should be Koo-ame!

00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:02.194
No, it's not read like that!

00:13:02.555 --> 00:13:05.120
How am I supposed to read it if it's Koo-same?

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:06.242
You know!

00:13:06.282 --> 00:13:07.926
That's the correct reading.

00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:09.649
Koo-same makes me think!

00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:11.414
Kousame.

00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:12.677
Babyshark.

00:13:12.717 --> 00:13:13.398
Babyshark.

00:13:13.498 --> 00:13:15.081
But it's not babyshark!

00:13:15.602 --> 00:13:18.267
Because babyshark is kou-zame.

00:13:19.489 --> 00:13:22.695
It becomes zame with a ten-ten.

00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:28.546
So then how am I supposed to do this without an S in front of ame so that it becomes kousame?

00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:29.769
Hai!

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:30.289
Hai!

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:32.734
What?

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:41.309
That's it though, if you do check the dictionary, it does say Kouame, but... Kouame wa chigau, yone.

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.750
Tsukawanai.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.713
Nobody uses it.

00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:44.894
Nante!

00:13:44.914 --> 00:13:46.816
Ima kara daijoubu deshou!

00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:47.958
Iwakan aru no kana?

00:13:47.978 --> 00:13:48.639
Iwakan nai!

00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:50.101
Betsu ni kimi nara?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:50.261
Oh!

00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:51.643
En!

00:13:51.783 --> 00:13:54.526
Yokotto.

00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:55.147
Mococo warukunai.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.489
Daijoubu datte hazu?

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:57.070
It's okay!

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.510
Tsukawanai!

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.792
Tsukawanai!

00:13:58.812 --> 00:13:59.633
Tsukawatte!

00:13:59.613 --> 00:14:01.215
Nobody uses it.

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:06.082
So even though the dictionary says yes, if nobody uses it, the dictionary is wrong.

00:14:06.102 --> 00:14:08.065
It's now koame.

00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:09.507
No Moco-chan, it's kosame.

00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:11.109
Now, koame.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.593
You better hope it doesn't drizzle in the future, huh?

00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:16.397
Tiny ring.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:17.238
Yes.

00:14:17.258 --> 00:14:17.658
Okay.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.085
And, baby should be kosame.

00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:24.648
Because kosame just sounds wrong.

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:25.890
That's all.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:29.630
BAU BAU!

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.071
I'm okay now.

00:14:31.213 --> 00:14:33.577
No problems.

00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:34.358
Nihongo muzukashii.

00:14:34.378 --> 00:14:35.099
Sonna koto nai yo!

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.609
Dakedo kore wa machigatteru janai desu ka kore!

00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:41.871
BAU BAU!

00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.752
You with me!

00:14:43.313 --> 00:14:43.674
Yeah!

00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:45.357
Mococo's always right!

00:14:45.377 --> 00:14:45.978
Yeah!

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:50.646
Moco-chan, you can call Abyss from now on and I'll just use this as a warning.

00:14:50.626 --> 00:15:07.103
I just wanna say no Moco-chan made a mistake.

00:15:07.443 --> 00:15:09.946
I also made an embarrassing mistake.

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:16.212
I called a piece of paper a piece of hair today.

00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:28.952
BAU BAU!

00:15:29.388 --> 00:15:29.869
Maybe.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.752
Maybe not.

00:15:32.772 --> 00:15:35.355
BAU BAU!

00:15:36.096 --> 00:15:36.557
Ruffians!

00:15:36.577 --> 00:15:41.022
Maybe if you've been taking a little bit of a look at Twitter, you noticed something.

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:52.476
But Subaru-senpai, she put out a very interesting questionnaire.

00:15:53.283 --> 00:15:54.144
Yeah?

00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:56.928
She's asking for your opinion!

00:15:56.948 --> 00:15:58.430
It's important that you answer!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.533
She's asking you, Ruffians!

00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:04.198
She wants you to think not too deeply.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.021
Yeah, don't think deeply about it.

00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:07.523
Yeah, just simply, you know?

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:10.227
Tell her your true feelings, whatever's on your heart.

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:11.148
Yeah.

00:16:11.489 --> 00:16:12.230
What's the question?

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.790
What's that?

00:16:14.493 --> 00:16:18.939
I... I... What's that?

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:22.564
Question?

00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:33.210
Which member of hololive are you?

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:40.943
Could be piano-ya, repeat-ya, idea-ya, voice-ya.

00:16:40.963 --> 00:16:48.957
Which member has the strongest form?

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:57.305
But I'm not Mari-sensei-senpai because obviously she's the strongest of them all, right?

00:16:58.407 --> 00:17:06.761
Ruffians, did you figure it out?

00:17:06.781 --> 00:17:08.324
The strongest what, Moco-chan?

00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:09.125
The strongest what?

00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:14.935
You have to say it again, the Ruffians didn't hear.

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:16.057
Couldn't hear.

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:17.600
Couldn't hear.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:17.880
Sighting!

00:17:19.598 --> 00:17:19.998
No.

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:22.461
Let's speak up, Moco-chan.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:26.684
I think the Ruffians understood because they said they voted for Mococo!

00:17:27.585 --> 00:17:27.845
Hai!

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:29.987
Hai!

00:17:30.428 --> 00:17:31.328
Hai!

00:17:31.348 --> 00:17:32.049
Couldn't hear soy.

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:34.851
Moco-chan, I think there's some Ruffians that really don't get it.

00:17:35.392 --> 00:17:35.812
Hai!

00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:37.534
Gonna have to say it again.

00:17:37.594 --> 00:17:38.214
Why don't you?

00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:41.677
I'm not gonna say it, Moco-chan!

00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:48.103
The strongest what was that?

00:17:49.315 --> 00:17:53.880
The strongest bone!

00:17:54.921 --> 00:18:04.652
So you know, with all of your heart, no thinking too hard about it.

00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:06.574
We definitely don't bite.

00:18:07.115 --> 00:18:11.339
I said it, so you have to vote now, okay?

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:16.105
FUWAMOCO, you know, we have big tails, right?

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:16.725
We do!

00:18:16.966 --> 00:18:17.746
Fluffy!

00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:18.327
Yes!

00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:30.210
Which tail's the strongest?

00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:32.637
Mococo, right?

00:18:32.853 --> 00:18:39.104
So Ruffians, make sure you vote for us, okay?

00:18:39.124 --> 00:18:40.566
It's very very important, okay?

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:44.373
Not frivolous at all.

00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:45.355
No, a bang for honor!

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.498
For honor, yes!

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:48.640
Vote it!

00:18:49.823 --> 00:18:51.606
You can find it on Subaru-senpai's Twitter!

00:18:52.046 --> 00:18:53.048
There's a questionnaire form.

00:18:53.068 --> 00:18:55.372
I think it's the Google questionnaire form.

00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:55.873
Yeah, probably Google.

00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:58.196
Oi, it's a very cute song.

00:18:58.657 --> 00:19:02.342
Hopefully you know you can head over to Subaru South by sweater.

00:19:02.362 --> 00:19:04.304
And click the link to the questionnaire.

00:19:04.324 --> 00:19:05.706
You know what to fill out, right?

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:09.631
Follow your heart, don't think too much.

00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:13.537
BAU BAU!

00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:16.701
As you know, Ruffians.

00:19:17.682 --> 00:19:25.152
Well, I know a lot of Ruffians have been sending us wonderful photos of their trips, you know, and their days, their walks.

00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:27.594
But, you're curious, you know?

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.240
FUWAMOCO, did you get to go see the cherry blossoms?

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.602
Did you get to do hanami?

00:19:33.622 --> 00:19:39.089
Because just recently, it was hanami season!

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:39.530
It was hanami season!

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:45.698
Yeah, and, um, well, we really really wish that we could say that they're still here, that hanami season continues!

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:48.361
I'm gonna stick around now.

00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:48.782
It's over.

00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:48.962
Yeah.

00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:52.101
But!

00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:52.402
Actually!

00:19:52.883 --> 00:19:58.832
We did get to do hanami!

00:19:58.852 --> 00:19:59.293
Our very first hanami!

00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:05.142
You know, it's a little bit complicated, but this is our very first proper hanami!

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:11.532
And you know, FUWAMOCO, this is our first spring with Abyssband in Japan!

00:20:11.913 --> 00:20:15.979
I thought, but... Every single time!

00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:20.221
FUWAMOCO Hi!

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:40.937
FUWAMOCO Hi!

00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:42.680
I just totally missed them.

00:20:45.706 --> 00:20:54.724
You know every time Hanami season kind of rolls around, I feel a little bit like a tinge that maybe it'll end in lonely feelings again.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.461
What!

00:20:57.802 --> 00:20:58.924
This year!

00:20:58.944 --> 00:20:59.224
This year!

00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:00.165
Actually!

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:03.309
That changed!

00:21:03.509 --> 00:21:03.890
Everything changed!

00:21:05.272 --> 00:21:06.433
Yeah!

00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:11.900
It changed!

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.080
Because!

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.881
We are invited to Hanami by Suisei-san!

00:21:12.901 --> 00:21:12.981
Bye!

00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:13.082
Bye!

00:21:13.102 --> 00:21:13.182
Bye!

00:21:13.202 --> 00:21:13.963
We are so so happy!

00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:19.089
We are getting a bit emotional looking at all the beautiful sakura, the cherry blossoms.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:20.411
Yeah!

00:21:20.431 --> 00:21:22.213
I know!

00:21:22.193 --> 00:21:29.782
But, you know, we went on a special boat together with her and a bunch of us and fun.

00:21:29.802 --> 00:21:34.347
We had yummy food and got to chat about a bunch of different things.

00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:35.709
Lots of laughing.

00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:36.950
We silly all together.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:43.878
Yeah, we put the series up by being extra silly.

00:21:43.978 --> 00:21:45.360
Romantic!

00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:46.902
Romantic fun.

00:21:47.162 --> 00:21:49.585
It was a bit romantic.

00:21:50.223 --> 00:21:53.209
Yeah, we got to chat a lot, you know, together.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.973
Aki-senpai.

00:21:54.993 --> 00:21:57.458
Mami-senpai.

00:21:57.478 --> 00:21:57.699
Nene-chi.

00:21:57.719 --> 00:21:59.542
Shion-senpai.

00:21:59.562 --> 00:21:59.663
Much.

00:21:59.683 --> 00:22:00.204
Yeah, you know.

00:22:00.464 --> 00:22:01.567
And Moco-chan.

00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:06.156
You stopped next to Rui-ne-senpai.

00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:09.893
But you know, she even poured his tea in.

00:22:09.993 --> 00:22:10.674
I felt bad.

00:22:10.694 --> 00:22:12.837
I was like, ah, no, I don't care!

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:15.541
But then she went to go get his refills, too.

00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:19.207
And I went to go rock them flowers, too.

00:22:19.647 --> 00:22:21.049
And then the A.S.M.P.I.

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:21.690
would laugh.

00:22:22.492 --> 00:22:23.874
They would rock quite a bit.

00:22:23.894 --> 00:22:26.177
I was like, ah!

00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:32.867
And then he would grip on the thing, and then the A.S.M.P.I.

00:22:32.887 --> 00:22:33.408
would just be like.

00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:34.530
That's the A.S.M.P.I.!

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.092
That was what she was like.

00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:50.286
And then we asked her if it was fun when she lost money betting on Hoi Swing King and she was like... She seeped a little bit.

00:22:51.689 --> 00:22:52.410
What was that?

00:22:53.723 --> 00:22:58.750
I'm glad you're bringing this up.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:58.931
Hot.

00:23:00.052 --> 00:23:00.152
Yeah.

00:23:00.173 --> 00:23:00.253
Hot.

00:23:00.273 --> 00:23:00.373
Yeah.

00:23:00.393 --> 00:23:07.003
And Kanon, it was super cute laughing a lot together with us too!

00:23:07.023 --> 00:23:07.283
Yeah, really.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:07.784
It was really hot.

00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:15.535
But you know, we're able to learn a lot from our senpai, you know, and it was just a really extra special experience for us.

00:23:16.456 --> 00:23:16.817
Yeah!

00:23:16.837 --> 00:23:21.424
And of course, the sakura, they're so beautiful!

00:23:21.444 --> 00:23:21.844
So pretty!

00:23:21.864 --> 00:23:22.245
It was really nice.

00:23:22.225 --> 00:23:47.372
BAU BAU!

00:23:48.196 --> 00:23:52.981
You know, no more lonely feelings.

00:23:53.902 --> 00:23:58.768
Make it an annual thing.

00:23:59.148 --> 00:24:01.831
That would be nice too.

00:24:01.891 --> 00:24:02.752
Hanami Otero-sama.

00:24:02.772 --> 00:24:03.493
No thank you.

00:24:03.973 --> 00:24:05.575
No, Ruffians, you can do it.

00:24:05.595 --> 00:24:06.576
We'll do that.

00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:09.019
I wouldn't wish that on the Ruffians.

00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:12.162
I'd like to do that together.

00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:17.308
BAU BAU!

00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:22.640
Wow, there's also something extra silly that we noticed.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.122
Something on our mind a bit, huh?

00:24:25.142 --> 00:24:26.123
Yeah, you know.

00:24:26.623 --> 00:24:31.728
Wow, we saw on Twitter that there's a very popular picture going around.

00:24:31.748 --> 00:24:33.510
I don't know.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.452
I feel very complicated when I look at this.

00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:37.633
Hi.

00:24:37.653 --> 00:24:38.394
Let's share.

00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:40.576
Well, let's take a look.

00:24:41.497 --> 00:24:44.700
There's been a little bit of a upon the trap set.

00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:47.042
Look here!

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.063
It's a train station!

00:24:49.263 --> 00:24:52.789
What's going on here?

00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:59.479
Look at the pon-de-rings, you know?

00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:07.132
I don't know, when I look at this I'm like, we're being targeted, you know?

00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:11.378
This is specifically for FUWAMOCO, hai!

00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:14.363
Nobody just loses pon-de-rings like that!

00:25:17.161 --> 00:25:23.753
Don't put them on the ground!

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.053
Right!

00:25:25.195 --> 00:25:32.829
Don't put them on the ground, but if you do then I'll go get them.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.251
Right!

00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:38.038
You know if you get a large amount, which this is quite a large amount, you get a box.

00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:41.423
And if you don't get a legend mount, then you get a very sturdy bag.

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:45.208
You know, so I'm thinking that this is targeted.

00:25:45.228 --> 00:25:49.014
And somebody said it drops for FUWAMOCO!

00:25:49.034 --> 00:25:50.095
FUWAMOCO no tame no hane desho kore!

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:52.078
Yeah, right.

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:53.580
They should have put them on napkins.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.202
Yeah, at the very least, you know.

00:25:55.403 --> 00:25:57.506
At the very least, that would be polite, you know.

00:25:57.586 --> 00:26:01.611
5 seconds, I have a feeling that maybe it was a little bit longer than 5 seconds.

00:26:03.634 --> 00:26:04.155
I'm glad though.

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:05.116
What did I have, what?

00:26:06.579 --> 00:26:07.620
I'm not seeing anything.

00:26:08.714 --> 00:26:13.680
Well, let's hope Justin doesn't think about it too much, huh?

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.803
More than what happened, not thought of this yet.

00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:20.149
No ideas, don't think about it, don't look at it, Justin, don't!

00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:20.269
Okay!

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:20.850
I didn't see anything.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.231
Don't look at the meme.

00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:23.633
Don't have them, okay?

00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:24.274
Pause, okay?

00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:25.355
Yeah.

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:25.536
Got it.

00:26:25.796 --> 00:26:26.116
Yeah.

00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:30.482
But, um... I'm surprised I haven't thought of this.

00:26:30.502 --> 00:26:30.642
Yeah.

00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:32.204
I'm very hungry looking at this.

00:26:33.165 --> 00:26:35.689
I will follow that, wherever it leads.

00:26:35.709 --> 00:26:36.730
With all my heart.

00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:40.523
BAU BAU!

00:26:40.543 --> 00:26:44.670
10 hour rule!

00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:47.114
Really a pon-de-ring!

00:26:47.134 --> 00:26:50.160
Pon-de-ring is the most delicious within the first 48 hours.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.349
It's also exposed to, you know, the elements, the maybe, maybe 12 hours.

00:26:55.869 --> 00:27:00.237
And then after that it's a little bit questionable, but you know it's a pon-de-ring so you really could

00:27:04.199 --> 00:27:09.626
Let's get up upon the xylophone and take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:09.646 --> 00:27:21.401
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Monika!

00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.162
Monika!

00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:23.764
BAU BAU!

00:27:24.465 --> 00:27:28.350
Monika, that's such a silly sleepy face.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.247
I love it.

00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:33.750
Hi!

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.276
Monika is apparently the potato breed of dog.

00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:38.399
Potato breed.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.685
Do you like dog breed Ruffians, you know?

00:27:41.865 --> 00:27:45.352
Shiba Inu, the roscoyki, the potato.

00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:47.436
Yeah, the potato.

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:49.699
The cute potato!

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.701
Sleepy potato.

00:27:50.841 --> 00:27:52.344
Yeah!

00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:53.726
Potato breathing.

00:27:53.746 --> 00:27:54.367
That's Monika.

00:27:54.387 --> 00:27:55.989
This is Monika potato.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:56.710
Yeah.

00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:58.112
Cuddled potato.

00:27:58.192 --> 00:27:59.695
Yes.

00:28:02.239 --> 00:28:03.521
Very cute.

00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.345
How does Monika BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:28:07.647 --> 00:28:08.428
I still don't think it's a...

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:28.082
I think we can see it in the photo here.

00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:31.408
Monika's very sleepy still.

00:28:31.428 --> 00:28:35.034
But it's time to wake up Monika!

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:38.320
Wake up!

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:38.500
Wake up!

00:28:42.057 --> 00:28:49.367
BAU BAU!

00:28:50.393 --> 00:28:51.975
Oh, that cute little nose.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.697
Ah, where's the potato tummy?

00:28:54.197 --> 00:28:55.078
Potato tummy?

00:28:55.098 --> 00:28:55.198
Yeah.

00:28:55.979 --> 00:28:57.761
Okay, I'll take the nose, you take the tummy.

00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:02.226
Oh, potato tummy tickles.

00:29:02.246 --> 00:29:02.347
Yeah!

00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:02.527
BAU BAU!

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.609
Hello Ruffians!

00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:10.055
As you can see, things are starting to get a little bit warmer as we get deeper into the spring season.

00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:10.736
Yeah, it rocks!

00:29:11.457 --> 00:29:16.262
So, let's take a look where you've been going on walks on today I Let Anna Walk.

00:29:16.282 --> 00:29:19.506
We have the dance!

00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:22.991
Oh my gosh!

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:23.793
Beautiful sakura!

00:29:26.557 --> 00:29:27.518
I wonder how heavy.

00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:29.201
It looks so heavy!

00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:35.210
This must be a legendary sakura tree if it's over a thousand years old.

00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:38.535
Is it named Takizakura?

00:29:38.815 --> 00:29:39.336
It looks delicious.

00:29:39.396 --> 00:29:42.000
Or maybe it's just the type of the tree.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.272
I think this tree is definitely amazing enough to deserve its own name, no?

00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:50.484
I'm Takizakura-san!

00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:50.945
Sanzuke.

00:29:51.888 --> 00:29:52.770
Takizakura-sama.

00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:54.475
Asama.

00:29:54.595 --> 00:29:57.002
Nami-sama.

00:29:56.982 --> 00:29:59.525
BAU BAU!

00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:10.018
It was an amazing time just gazing at the beautiful cherry blossoms here and enjoying an ice tea!

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:12.901
We're glad that you were able to enjoy the coming of spring!

00:30:14.423 --> 00:30:16.906

00:30:16.926 --> 00:30:18.027
So pretty!

00:30:18.188 --> 00:30:19.870
Mococo colors!

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:22.753
Moco-chan season!

00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:27.582
I could only ever hope to be as magnificent as that tree, huh?

00:30:27.603 --> 00:30:29.827
Yeah, this is like, uh, wow.

00:30:29.847 --> 00:30:33.434
Yeah, at least ten generations?

00:30:33.454 --> 00:30:34.957
Wow!

00:30:35.197 --> 00:30:36.540
I'm not that old yet.

00:30:38.478 --> 00:30:40.682
What does that mean Moco-chan?

00:30:40.782 --> 00:30:41.924
That means what it means!

00:30:41.944 --> 00:30:45.870
I'm not that old yet.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.855

00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:49.997
Thank you!

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:52.901
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:30:53.102 --> 00:30:56.487
Today's Question of the Day is...

00:30:56.467 --> 00:30:59.631
Hey FUWAMOCO!

00:30:59.952 --> 00:31:08.203
Lately I'm starting to think that I'm losing my passion for this thing that I love, but I still don't want to just leave it.

00:31:08.664 --> 00:31:10.486
Have you also encountered the same?

00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:15.333
If so, I would like to know how did you guys deal with it?

00:31:15.914 --> 00:31:17.175
BAU BAU!

00:31:17.796 --> 00:31:19.479
It's okay, you know.

00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:22.002
We totally understand this feeling.

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:28.875
I'd say it kinda might be hard to believe, but we've felt this feeling this way too before.

00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:34.807
And you know, we got really deep and focused on our demon dog training before.

00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:37.071
And you know...

00:31:37.304 --> 00:31:44.015
We actually started to become a little bit distant toward the things that we like, you know, like anime and games.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.458
It's hard to believe, right?

00:31:45.638 --> 00:31:46.399
It's hard to believe!

00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:47.962
It happens.

00:31:48.122 --> 00:31:52.309
It happened and you know, it even got to the point that maybe you know we thought

00:31:52.728 --> 00:31:58.780
You know, all the special things that you really love.

00:31:59.782 --> 00:32:06.295
But you know, it turned out that sometimes you just have ups and downs, ebbs and flows, and that's natural.

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:12.728
You know, maybe sometime a way to focus on other things, maybe that's necessary.

00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:17.495
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:28.690

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:32:33.717 --> 00:32:37.582
Maybe sometimes you just need a little time, and that's okay.

00:32:38.524 --> 00:32:43.531
A strong passion, it can't burn strongly forever, you know?

00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:44.752
It can't just be the same.

00:32:44.993 --> 00:32:48.738
Sometimes it might weaken, the fire goes up, it goes down.

00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:50.981
Maybe it burns even harder, maybe not.

00:32:52.443 --> 00:32:53.685
But you never know, okay?

00:32:54.186 --> 00:32:55.508
So just enjoy life!

00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:58.832
Enjoy what makes you happy!

00:32:58.852 --> 00:32:59.493
Okay?

00:32:59.513 --> 00:33:00.855
Don't sweat it too much.

Your walks, Ruffians, right now is the time to enjoy a very good walk!

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.344

We have another stream coming up soon!

00:33:43.597 --> 00:33:48.985
Soon, next, we're gonna be going out for a bit of a recording day!

00:33:49.045 --> 00:33:50.467
Yeah, we should fly!

00:33:51.088 --> 00:33:53.091
We're gonna do our best, we're really excited!

00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:54.232
But!

00:33:55.234 --> 00:34:01.182
After that, we'll be back for FUWAMOCO Morning on Wednesday!

00:34:01.202 --> 00:34:04.347
What kind of troubles are we gonna get ourselves into between then, huh?

00:34:04.707 --> 00:34:05.428
Nothing!

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:12.338
So, we'll do our best, Ruffians, and you do your best too, okay?

00:34:12.942 --> 00:34:17.208
Can we take a peek at our schedule too?

00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:25.139
After FUWAMOCO Morning, on Wednesday in the evening, we'll be playing Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.441
We will not be screaming.

00:34:26.742 --> 00:34:32.830
Yeah, it'll be a crazy time because last time we had a bit of a struggle defeating the boss, but we beat him!

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:33.411
Yes!

00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:34.893
And now, with the mic courts.

00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:36.135
Yeah.

00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:37.617
Mic courts.

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:40.970
Uh oh.

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:45.496
You better see what happens when we get on the Minecraft Ruffians.

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:51.784
But then we can forget all about it because it's Biboo's birthday party!

00:34:51.804 --> 00:34:53.586
It's actually today.

00:34:54.007 --> 00:35:00.415
So that means you gotta go say happy birthday to Biboo because today is the day that she was born.
