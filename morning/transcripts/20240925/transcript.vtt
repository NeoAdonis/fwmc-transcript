00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.554
Hello BAU BAU!

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:07.401
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:09.145
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:17.103
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:20.204
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:22.945
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.245
BAU BAU!

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:30.167
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:31.747
Ruffians!

00:06:31.907 --> 00:06:32.527
Sky Blinding!

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:35.128
BAU BAU!

00:06:35.288 --> 00:06:37.529
It's been a little while, Ruffians!

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.433
Thank you for joining us today for our 127th episode!

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:49.461
We're so happy to be back!

00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:50.942
Yeah, it's been a while!

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:55.287
Yeah, there's been a little bit of different programming going on.

00:06:56.027 --> 00:06:57.848
It's a bit different than normal, huh?

00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:00.769
But we're back for our 127th episode!

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.610
Thank you for waking up, Ruffians!

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.510
Thank you!

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.790
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:11.412
Well, for Ruffians who are just joining us for the first time today... Good morning!

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:12.453
Good morning!

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:13.853
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:18.975
It's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday!

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:19.855
A.K.A.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:20.755
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:22.376
And it's hosted by us!

00:07:22.956 --> 00:07:24.457
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:30.302
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:30.943
Yeah!

00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:33.805
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:36.927

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:40.891
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

FUWAMOCO.

00:07:53.358 --> 00:07:54.759
More hashtag, hashtag.

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:56.559
I just had an idea.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.960
Huh?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.780
Can I down?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.520
Can I down?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.380
Okay.

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:02.861
Okay.

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:15.497
My first idea of the day, Ruffians!

00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:17.638
BAU BAU!

00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:19.019
BAU BAU!

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:21.460
I hope you have your first idea of the day soon.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.161
Yeah.

00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:23.641
Yeah.

00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.482
BAU BAU!

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:27.203
BAU BAU!

00:08:27.463 --> 00:08:32.005
Well, Ruffians, it's been about a week since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:33.046
Yeah.

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:37.308
But there's been a lot of stuff going on.

00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:37.388
Yes!

00:08:37.408 --> 00:08:39.089
Let's take a look.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.850
Actually...

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.722
What else do we have?

00:08:46.983 --> 00:08:47.443
You know.

00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:48.163
What?

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:48.503
What?

00:08:48.623 --> 00:08:48.863
What?

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:51.544
What do you mean you know, Moco-chan?

00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:55.985
Pero Sighting.

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:59.445
We've been holo-santos for a week, Ruffians!

00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:05.787
I didn't see Pero really there that long.

00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:06.727
Sighting, but...

00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:09.189
Did you see all the Ruffians?

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:10.089
Let's take a look.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:11.610
Okay.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.950
Okay.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.212
De-den!

00:09:17.372 --> 00:09:17.652
What?

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:18.172
What?

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.053
What is this?

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:20.613
Huh?

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:22.333
A petal flower?

00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:23.874
He's a baboon!

00:09:24.154 --> 00:09:24.794
Yeah!

00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:25.715
Baboon?

00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:28.476
I don't know if I like the sound of that.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.916
It sounds so cheerful though, no?

00:09:31.817 --> 00:09:32.057
Maybe?

00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:41.506
But, you know, Ruffians, well, you know they say it's not good to really pick flowers, right?

00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:42.707
Without permission.

00:09:42.747 --> 00:09:46.788
Yeah, because then somebody, they're gonna not be able to enjoy the flower.

00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:51.270
It's only gonna be you who enjoys the flower, especially when they're not yours and stuff.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.192
If they're not yours, that's one thing, but if you want to pick the flower and it's yours, then you're okay.

00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:58.313
But, but, I feel like...

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.471
In this case, this is a special case for a friend!

00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:09.695
You know, so, uh... Why don't you go ahead... Pick that flower!

00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:13.157
Give it to someone who would really truly appreciate it, you know?

00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:15.058
Someone like maybe...

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.161
Garbage can.

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:21.304
Why?

00:10:21.584 --> 00:10:26.168
I guess at that point, it would be now a... It was a miracle of nature.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.409
Yeah.

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:27.789
It was.

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.070
Past tense.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.193
No petal flowers!

00:10:32.573 --> 00:10:33.834
No, we don't need those.

00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:34.795
BAU BAU!

00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:39.058
Petal flower.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:42.681
The least liked flower by FUWAMOCO.

00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:44.903
Imagine getting a bouquet like that.

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:48.396
I don't want to imagine that.

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:50.118
That's really nasty.

00:10:50.718 --> 00:10:53.140
That's a bouquet of flowers you give to your worst enemy.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.301
Yeah.

00:10:54.962 --> 00:10:55.222
Yeah.

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:55.823
I guess.

00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:57.544
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:57.905
Yes?

00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:00.687
You like a sexy flower?

00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:01.508
Huh?

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.250
Huh?

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:05.972
Huh?

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:06.773
What flower?

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.014
A sexy flower.

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.957
We're talking about nasty flowers.

00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:15.664
It's okay, forget it, forget it.

00:11:15.764 --> 00:11:18.345
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:20.887
Look, we got distracted there.

00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:26.630
But you know, there's been some really big important things going on since our last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.333
So let's introduce some of them, shall we?

00:11:31.393 --> 00:11:38.298
I'm sure you've heard Ruffians, but... Sure, but... Wow, some big important news is that... Wow.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.512
Our very dear senpai, Amelia Watson of Holomyth.

00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:48.375
She's announced that she'll be ending her streaming activities at the end of this month.

00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:50.316
It's not a graduation though!

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:54.579
No, it's just, it will be the end of her current activities though.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:57.700
You know, it's hard to say goodbye.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.062
But we're wishing her the absolute best!

00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:03.203
We'll treasure all the special memories we made together!

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:05.786
Not graduating.

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:11.494
But FUWAMOCO, you know, we really wish that we could have gotten to know Ame-senpai even better.

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:16.741
But the times that we did shit, you know, like we had the spelling bee!

00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:18.643
And then a manga.

00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:38.872
We were really super lucky to be able to have our first and last collab together with Ame-senpai!

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:43.713
Just the other day we solved some puzzles in Escape Simulator!

00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:46.394
It's just like we had always dreamed of!

00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:48.935
That was one of my big dreams.

00:12:49.015 --> 00:12:50.296
They were a bit tricky too, huh?

00:12:50.316 --> 00:12:53.679
Yeah, some of them really were, but... Good morning.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:55.580
It was really fun.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.343
I liked how Ame-senpai was like, FUWAMOCO, do you wanna do this part?

00:13:00.924 --> 00:13:01.864
It was very nice.

00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:04.847
We could've done very well, huh?

00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:07.909
It was really fun sitting with the wand, though!

00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:11.272
Please check it out if you haven't, okay?

00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:13.094
Yeah, I saw there was one comment.

00:13:13.194 --> 00:13:18.139
Oh, if Ame- If Ame-senpai, if she does this, she'll get it on the first try.

00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:22.197
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:25.500
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.161
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:42.976
Everything that she's done that she's brought to us.

00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:45.498
All of hololive English!

00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:49.843
But she still has a very exciting week coming up.

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:51.464
Lots of really cool things.

00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:52.065
Let's take a look.

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:53.266
There's a sketch meeting.

00:13:53.286 --> 00:13:55.929
It's a little bit small, so it's hard to see here.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:14:00.854
But obviously we have some Elden Ring Endurance streams coming up.

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:05.155
Wow, you know Ame-senpai was playing Elden Ring a lot then.

00:14:05.715 --> 00:14:09.837
I guess maybe we're gonna see where that adventure goes even more.

00:14:09.857 --> 00:14:13.920
And then there's gonna be a Valve multiplayer marathon too!

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:20.483
But, I guess more FUWAMOCO will be there when we play Team Fortress 2 and Garry's Mod as well.

00:14:20.523 --> 00:14:23.785
There's gonna be a bunch of other Valve games being

00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:25.667
Ocean Charity Stream

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:44.548
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:14:44.588 --> 00:14:47.050
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:04.123 --> 00:15:05.825
Yeah, that will be really special too.

00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:10.249
And then, on the 30th, on September 30th at 5pm PT.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.673
That will be Ame-senpai's final stream there.

00:15:13.693 --> 00:15:16.676
Make sure you don't miss it, okay Ruffians?

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:25.165
It might be hard sometimes, but let's all make sure to be able to say goodbye with a smile.

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:26.087
We'll smile!

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:33.275
Yeah, and of course, FUWAMOCO will be there watching the Miz Club and Abyss Senpai's final stream too, so...

00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:38.440
Thank you for everything, everyone!

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.282
And I look forward to the remaining series that we have here together.

00:15:43.362 --> 00:15:43.902
BAU BAU!

00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:46.364
Let's make it really fun again!

00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:47.244
BAU BAU!

00:15:47.324 --> 00:15:48.525
BAU BAU!

00:15:51.648 --> 00:15:58.410
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.492
Ruffians!

00:16:03.152 --> 00:16:03.652
We did it!

00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:04.332
We did it!

00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:08.354
We finally made our hologram debut!

00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:17.709
If you're maybe wondering what exactly hologram is, the full title is holo no graffiti.

00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:23.233
It's a very long running 3D anime that airs on the hololive official channel every week.

00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:25.835
And by air I mean like there's a new episode.

00:16:26.076 --> 00:16:27.117
But air sounds cooler.

00:16:28.443 --> 00:16:31.104
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:33.365
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:35.747
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:49.373
You're like a pondering butterfly!

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:54.577
You're definitely in nature, huh?

00:16:55.157 --> 00:16:56.598
A pondering butterfly.

00:16:56.879 --> 00:16:59.460
You're like me having a fever!

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.242
Fuwawa scream!

00:17:01.262 --> 00:17:03.103
This is not anything like it.

00:17:11.783 --> 00:17:12.964
That's probably it.

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:13.845
That's pretty it.

00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:15.947
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:24.735
Within the 1 minute and 50 seconds, I think you can see just how much trouble and silliness that we could get into.

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:27.557
It was pretty close.

00:17:27.597 --> 00:17:28.438
It was perfect.

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:31.961
BAU BAU!

00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:34.163
If you like the part where we hug the most.

00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:36.565
When was that?

00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:38.787
I thought it was maybe that part.

00:17:42.787 --> 00:17:48.809
Ruffians, if you haven't watched it yet, please go over to the official hololive channel!

00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:55.831
Check it out and make sure to leave a comment on the episode just to let us know how much you liked seeing us in hololive!

00:17:58.012 --> 00:18:00.613
Somehow, I don't know how it happened, but

00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:26.788
hololive GTA.

00:18:26.928 --> 00:18:29.391
The week long hololive GTA event.

00:18:29.952 --> 00:18:33.176
It came to an end and it ended with a big bang!

00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:34.637
Yeah!

00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:37.180
Can we explain in case they don't know?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.281
Yeah!

00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:40.644
Well... We mentioned this lately before, but...

00:18:41.285 --> 00:18:47.808
But the reason behind why FUWAMOCO Morning wasn't on last week was because of this very big event.

00:18:47.848 --> 00:18:53.631
You know, all of hololive JP, ID, EN, device, it was that big event.

00:18:53.891 --> 00:18:56.912
All of us were all participating in holo GTA.

00:18:56.992 --> 00:19:00.554
Yeah, and it was our first time ever too!

00:19:00.694 --> 00:19:01.574
Yeah, right!

00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:03.135
We had no clue what to expect.

00:19:03.235 --> 00:19:04.395
Yeah, you're still catching up.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.936
There's a lot that went on.

00:19:05.956 --> 00:19:06.857
There is a lot.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.178
So many different perspectives.

00:19:10.158 --> 00:19:11.199
A lot of chaos.

00:19:11.379 --> 00:19:12.200
A lot of laughs.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.360
Heartbreak.

00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:14.581
Betrayal.

00:19:15.182 --> 00:19:15.702
Everything.

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:15.782
Wow.

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:17.864
It has everything.

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:18.324
Yeah.

00:19:18.364 --> 00:19:19.545
And of course explosions.

00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:19.925
Yeah.

00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:21.246
But to explain a bit more!

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:21.426
Yes!

00:19:21.847 --> 00:19:24.789
Well, we moved to the town of Holosantos!

00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:27.891
And we did our best working different professions.

00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:29.672
You know, there was the gang.

00:19:29.692 --> 00:19:30.653
And the police.

00:19:30.813 --> 00:19:33.295
They had civilians like the bakery.

00:19:33.535 --> 00:19:36.037
The cabaret.

00:19:36.357 --> 00:19:36.958
You know the...

00:19:38.296 --> 00:19:44.598
FUWAMOCO!

00:19:44.638 --> 00:19:48.419
You'd think that we might have been working at the cat cafe.

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:53.240
But we became medics and we're working at the pillbox hospital!

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.441
Because, you know, this is a roleplay series.

00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:59.882
So, you know, it's a bit different than normal life!

00:19:59.922 --> 00:20:01.242
Yeah, but we're just a bit...

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.364
We are working under the head medic Fubuki-sensei!

00:20:04.424 --> 00:20:13.630
Together with a bunch of other medics like Banjo-sensei, Ina-sensei, Iris-sensei, Iofi-sensei, Ririka-sensei.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.332
It was a lot of fun, you know?

00:20:16.692 --> 00:20:19.934
I don't know how it happened, but six hours every day.

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:21.395
It went by in no time.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:21.996
Right!

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:25.078
Yeah, we did all our shifts too!

00:20:25.298 --> 00:20:28.480
But by the end of it, we were really sad that it had

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.603
It was legendary, right?

00:20:31.703 --> 00:20:36.928
We feel so honored to have been a part!

00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:37.909
But it's sort of funny.

00:20:37.929 --> 00:20:40.992
I already feel nostalgic now somehow.

00:20:41.012 --> 00:20:43.915
You watched all the TV show!

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:46.417
We were the best doctors!

00:20:50.841 --> 00:20:55.965
But you know the event, because you know it was with a JP-senpai and everything too.

00:20:56.285 --> 00:20:58.507
The event was mainly in Japanese.

00:20:58.567 --> 00:21:04.072
But we had Pero TL helping us translate the whole 7 day event live!

00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:08.595
So please check out the archives if you weren't able to join us in the moment.

00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:12.699
You know it was pretty crazy when it comes to different time zones and everything too.

00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:14.180
So please check out

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.021
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:18.701
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:20.762
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.841
It's hard to pick a favorite while we keep on going.

00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:49.024
What's your favorite moment?

00:21:50.324 --> 00:21:58.346
I don't think we can really say it, but we picked some of our very special photos that we got to take during our time in Holosan for us.

00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:03.848
This isn't from our perspective, but I think it's one of our favorite moments.

00:22:04.228 --> 00:22:09.730
It's a bit of a spoiler, so if you don't want to know how the story ends, look away for now.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.570
Turn off your headphones.

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:13.371
But!

00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:14.331
Yeah.

00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:15.611
This moment.

00:22:16.152 --> 00:22:16.572
You know.

00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:17.472
Wow.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.471
I don't know!

00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:20.851
Ruffians!

00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:24.373
The three ended with that wedding!

00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:29.916
You'd think that it was all scripted or something, but it was all live!

00:22:30.257 --> 00:22:31.918
Just happening right then!

00:22:32.238 --> 00:22:34.579
Coincidence after coincidence!

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.301
It was amazing!

00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:39.762
Amazing wedding!

00:22:40.582 --> 00:22:41.263
I don't know...

00:22:42.865 --> 00:22:44.026
What a clean shot.

00:22:44.146 --> 00:22:45.367
Yeah.

00:22:45.748 --> 00:22:47.109
It was so good.

00:22:47.189 --> 00:22:52.214
If you haven't been able to check it out, please find out why this happened.

00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:54.977
The events leading up to it.

00:22:55.537 --> 00:23:05.286
Yeah, and I think, you know, if you check out a clip from HoloGT, maybe sometimes it might be hard not to hear Fubuki-sensei being FUWAMOCO!

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.901
We had a lot of fun, right?

00:23:09.001 --> 00:23:09.121
Yeah!

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:12.323
And you know, there's a bunch of different moments, you know?

00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:12.704
Yeah!

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:16.607
As in our... Sort of explosive... Ambulance!

00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:17.187
Yeah!

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:17.847
I know, yeah.

00:23:17.867 --> 00:23:19.909
Gotta get to the scene as fast as you can.

00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:21.190
And a couple incidents.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:27.114
Yeah, sometimes you get back to the hospital so fast that the patient's no longer with you.

00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:28.755
They're missing from your car.

00:23:29.035 --> 00:23:30.657
That happened a couple times, huh?

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:31.817
A couple times?

00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:32.418
Yeah.

00:23:33.374 --> 00:23:35.235
This normal stuff.

00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:37.477
We told them to wear their seatbelts!

00:23:37.517 --> 00:23:39.117
We did every time!

00:23:39.137 --> 00:23:40.979
We can't be helpful.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:42.840
We can't help them if they don't wear their seatbelts.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.381
Can't help them anymore than saying, put your seatbelt on.

00:23:45.421 --> 00:23:47.542
Ruffians, I think you should know now.

00:23:48.203 --> 00:23:49.303
Put your seatbelt on!

00:23:50.504 --> 00:23:50.864
Got it?

00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:51.505
Yeah.

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:52.265
Yeah.

00:23:52.846 --> 00:24:00.090
Did you like it?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.711
I liked our dog.

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:03.832
I liked it!

00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:06.393
It was a challenge getting up the stairs.

00:24:06.493 --> 00:24:08.194
It was a challenge in general!

00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:10.736
Definitely didn't want anyone over.

00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:13.829
We were smiling.

00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:14.509
Yeah.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.452
Smiling so much there was red all over the road.

00:24:17.773 --> 00:24:18.233
Yeah.

00:24:18.273 --> 00:24:20.055
So much lipstick.

00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:20.575
Yeah.

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:22.677
Yeah.

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:26.220
It was fun and... I'm burger car!

00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:29.584
Ultimate car is a burger car!

00:24:29.644 --> 00:24:31.345
Does it count as a car?

00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:32.807
It counts as a car.

00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:35.429
Well, the honk button isn't a honk button.

00:24:35.449 --> 00:24:36.310
There's no honk.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.231
No what though?

00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:45.478
What if it had jets so it could do more than just jump?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.641
We'll never know!

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:53.986
What if it could've done more than jump and just fly?

00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:54.887
Maybe?

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.671
Yeah, it had a boost.

00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:02.032
And then Garibaldi appeared!

00:25:02.092 --> 00:25:03.832
Don't care about Garibaldi!

00:25:03.892 --> 00:25:06.753
You have to check it out, okay?

00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:09.794
Garibaldi doesn't get hit by... Nothing.

00:25:09.854 --> 00:25:10.014
Yeah.

00:25:12.597 --> 00:25:15.958
Make sure you check it out, okay?

00:25:16.078 --> 00:25:18.019
But it was just so much fun.

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:22.060
We're really happy to be able to get to know our senpai.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:30.623
Also to have all of IAAN ID also included because you know it's really hard with multiple languages or language barriers.

00:25:30.643 --> 00:25:33.224
Especially knowing you have the police, the gang.

00:25:33.264 --> 00:25:35.745
You gotta hear some important instructions.

00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:41.346
Is there anyone watching FUWAMOCO Morning for the first time?

00:25:41.746 --> 00:25:42.326
Raise your hand!

00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:42.626
BAU BAU!

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:43.507
There might be.

00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:44.027
Liar.

00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:44.287
Liar.

00:25:44.307 --> 00:25:44.447
Liar.

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:08.372
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:08.452 --> 00:26:13.733
I see some new hands now!

00:26:13.813 --> 00:26:16.354
BAU BAU!

00:26:16.434 --> 00:26:19.694
Thank you and welcome!

00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:29.896
But you know, FUWAMOCO, whether in Holosantos or not, we'll continue to do our best to protect you so I am!

00:26:30.036 --> 00:26:32.337
And no ambulances included this time.

00:26:33.397 --> 00:26:33.657
No.

00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:39.097
I miss it.

00:26:39.277 --> 00:26:42.302
When I hear a clip and I hear the sounds down in my heart.

00:26:42.483 --> 00:26:45.388
We really are so honored to have been apart.

00:26:45.788 --> 00:26:46.550
I still don't get it.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:54.824
It feels a little bit like a dream.

00:26:55.304 --> 00:26:56.186
It's another week.

00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:58.350
Another week all of a sudden.

00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:08.174
Has it been a little bit of a struggle without FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:12.275
Do you need maybe a little bit of a Pup Talk?

00:27:12.295 --> 00:27:17.096
Moco-chan, is there some words you could give us today?

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:24.877
Ruffians!

00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:27.457
Do you know?

00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:29.898
Do you know it's back?

00:27:31.695 --> 00:27:32.516
Yeah!

00:27:32.956 --> 00:27:36.779
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:39.601
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:41.142
Mococo!

00:27:42.423 --> 00:27:43.003
Ruffians!

00:27:44.004 --> 00:27:46.225
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:49.688
Did you miss it?

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:58.636
Well, you know, sometimes it's good to take a small break and then get back into your regular groove, you know?

00:27:58.656 --> 00:28:06.543
We had fun in Holosantos together, but you know, it's also important to treasure our regular everyday as well.

00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:15.292
So, let's all try to keep ourselves in tip-top shape and also try to do something that's a bit scary.

00:28:15.972 --> 00:28:16.273
Maybe...

00:28:17.168 --> 00:28:17.709
Everyday.

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:22.334
Cuz you never know what kind of amazing result you could have too.

00:28:22.354 --> 00:28:23.195
Yes!

00:28:25.358 --> 00:28:26.279
You can do it!

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.562
Ganbatte de!

00:28:28.962 --> 00:28:29.743
BAU BAU!

00:28:31.033 --> 00:28:33.416
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:37.760
Let's do it best Ruffians again!

00:28:38.441 --> 00:28:42.065
Let's take a look at some of the regular corners then!

00:28:42.626 --> 00:28:47.731
Today we have a brand new Doggie of the Day!

00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:52.916
Today's Doggie of the Day is De-den!

00:28:54.938 --> 00:28:55.258
Joey!

00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:56.899
Cute boy!

00:28:56.959 --> 00:28:57.440
Joey!

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.001
Joey, you look so wise!

00:29:00.642 --> 00:29:01.462
I guess what?

00:29:01.562 --> 00:29:03.224
Tomorrow!

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:08.067
Tomorrow is Joey's birthday!

00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:11.870
Happy birthday, Joey!

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.070
Happy birthday!

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.491
So cute fluffy!

00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:14.611
Right?

00:29:14.892 --> 00:29:15.452
Fluffy!

00:29:15.472 --> 00:29:18.174
This means you know now Joey's gonna be getting even wiser.

00:29:18.574 --> 00:29:21.296
That's a 10 out of 10 dog.

00:29:21.316 --> 00:29:24.779
Yeah, I think so too.

00:29:25.419 --> 00:29:26.840
Looks like Garibaldi.

00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:29.342
This is Jolie.

00:29:29.362 --> 00:29:31.344
This is Jolie, not Garibaldi.

00:29:31.724 --> 00:29:33.045
Not Husky Miku.

00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:34.246
Very different.

00:29:34.266 --> 00:29:35.347
This is Jolie.

00:29:35.627 --> 00:29:39.090
And tomorrow is Jolie's birthday, so happy birthday Jolie!

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.792
BAU BAU!

00:29:42.272 --> 00:29:44.233
How does Jolie BAU BAU?

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:48.981
Sounds wise?

00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:51.905
That's what I was going for.

00:30:00.888 --> 00:30:05.372
Well, Julie, thank you for being a fan of FUWAMOCO!

00:30:05.572 --> 00:30:06.472
Especially Mococo!

00:30:06.512 --> 00:30:07.693
BAU BAU!

00:30:08.254 --> 00:30:17.920
I'm gonna say make sure that you BAU BAU lots and not just when you see Moco-chan on the screen, okay?

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.020
Okay!

00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:21.303
BAU BAU!

00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:25.586
I got that one.

00:30:25.666 --> 00:30:27.067
Not just when Pup Talks, okay?

00:30:30.488 --> 00:30:33.129
FUWAMOCO!

00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:38.891
Next we have our... Today I went on a walk with Ruffians!

00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:40.452
Mane-chan!

00:30:40.892 --> 00:30:47.154
Mane-chan wanted to let you know first that there's gonna be a spider in this next video.

00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:50.295
So if you don't like spiders, look away, okay?

00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:52.336
Let's take a look!

00:30:54.536 --> 00:30:54.697
Oh!

00:30:55.557 --> 00:30:55.677
Oh!

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.764
Moco-chan!

00:31:07.784 --> 00:31:10.967
Mane-chan tried to save you, but Moco-chan messed it up.

00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.167
I messed it up!

00:31:12.248 --> 00:31:13.408
I messed it up!

00:31:13.448 --> 00:31:19.032
I messed it up!

00:31:19.192 --> 00:31:23.535
Well, let's take a look now that we already saw the funky spider.

00:31:23.555 --> 00:31:25.417
Okay, real spider.

00:31:25.437 --> 00:31:26.618
You gotta get ready, okay?

00:31:26.678 --> 00:31:27.678
Real spider now!

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:29.780
Just now, you didn't see it before.

00:31:33.922 --> 00:31:37.124
Really funky but really cool, right?

00:31:38.004 --> 00:31:39.065
It's also kind of funny.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.646
It does look like a starfish but an angry one.

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:44.248
A starfish I do not want on me.

00:31:44.268 --> 00:31:45.668
Really tastes like a starfish.

00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:48.250
I would think it tastes like a spider.

00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:51.089
I unfortunately have tasted that.

00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:52.969
Camerafolding with RTX On!

00:31:52.989 --> 00:31:53.209
Chuu!

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.010
Chuu!

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.170
Basically.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.790
Basically.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.431
Yeah, just a little.

00:31:58.451 --> 00:31:59.991
It's not good.

00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:01.572
Yeah, but you know.

00:32:01.672 --> 00:32:02.032
Yeah.

00:32:02.052 --> 00:32:04.453
Definitely crypto money, chan.

00:32:05.147 --> 00:32:09.430
Yeah, so it's just that good of a photo, you know?

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.791
Yeah, but is it fluffy or fuzzy though?

00:32:12.811 --> 00:32:15.333
Let's decide together Moco-chan, okay?

00:32:16.033 --> 00:32:17.094
Okay.

00:32:17.114 --> 00:32:18.094
3, 2, 1.

00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:19.035
Fuzzy!

00:32:19.455 --> 00:32:21.096
Yeah, definitely fuzzy.

00:32:21.476 --> 00:32:22.177
Yeah.

00:32:22.237 --> 00:32:22.537
BAU BAU!

00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:27.100
Stay away from it though.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.701
I'm glad it didn't go on you.

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.464
BAU BAU!

00:32:35.404 --> 00:32:38.605
And next we have a Question of the Day!

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.347
Moco-chan don't mess this one up okay?

00:32:41.367 --> 00:32:45.609
We have a Question of the Day!

00:32:46.788 --> 00:32:48.588
De-den!

00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:51.929
What is Fuwawa's favorite Samuel character?

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:55.590
What is Mococo's favorite Samuel character?

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.470
Also, what are your favorite Pokemon?

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.791
Please let us know!

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:02.471
BAU BAU!

00:33:02.891 --> 00:33:03.851
Good question.

00:33:03.871 --> 00:33:05.632
No spiders this time.

00:33:06.192 --> 00:33:07.892
Oh, I see some good guesses.

00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:09.592
Fuwawa!

00:33:09.652 --> 00:33:12.013
My favorite Samuel character is...

00:33:13.073 --> 00:33:17.575
Has to be Pompompurin Oshinomobo!

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.036
Yeah, that one's very cute.

00:33:20.277 --> 00:33:21.777
I like little twin stars.

00:33:22.017 --> 00:33:22.218
Yeah.

00:33:22.738 --> 00:33:24.979
Yeah, but Pompompurin's cute as well.

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:27.940
Yeah, it's a really good vibe, but... Little twin stars!

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.922
They can even say bad and their names in a sentence, Moco-chan.

00:33:30.962 --> 00:33:31.222
What?

00:33:32.988 --> 00:33:36.170
When did I do wrong?

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.030
BAU BAU!

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.512
It's not Sanrio, but we really like Pondylion too!

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.853
The best mascot!

00:33:42.933 --> 00:33:43.894
Yeah!

00:33:44.214 --> 00:33:49.176
But Pondylion is Pon-de-ring Mister Donut's mascot.

00:33:49.196 --> 00:33:51.698
Yeah, we really like mascot characters.

00:33:52.418 --> 00:33:59.061
But as for Pokemon, there's so many good Pokemon, but I really like Leporeon.

00:33:59.121 --> 00:33:59.361
Yeah.

00:33:59.782 --> 00:34:00.242
Moco-chan.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:03.977
I like Alolan Raichu.

00:34:04.718 --> 00:34:06.261
But you don't like Fluffy, right?

00:34:07.342 --> 00:34:07.963
Not so much.

00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:08.984
Yeah.

00:34:09.986 --> 00:34:18.018
We're not gonna get too angry at Fluffy though because otherwise Fluffy's gonna get us back and that's gonna be scary.

00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:22.127
Right, Moco-chan?

00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:23.967
FUWAMOCO was scary last time, right?

00:34:24.047 --> 00:34:27.628
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:30.488
I love and like you!

00:34:30.688 --> 00:34:32.929
BAU BAU!

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:36.410
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for your submissions!

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:43.771
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is always something that we make together, so thank you for being here with us!

00:34:43.991 --> 00:34:46.892
We're always looking forward to more doggy of a days!

00:34:47.572 --> 00:34:49.633
To be seeing the walks that you've been going on.

00:34:49.693 --> 00:34:50.994
Hopefully you don't see spiders.

00:34:51.034 --> 00:34:54.595
Maybe you might be seeing the change in color of the leaves soon.

00:34:55.296 --> 00:34:58.938
Hopefully no peril amongst those leaves, you know?

00:34:59.518 --> 00:35:01.279
So please let us know!

00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:05.201
You can use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:06.621
Okay, Ruffians!

00:35:07.081 --> 00:35:07.502
BAU BAU!

00:35:08.382 --> 00:35:11.525
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:11.665 --> 00:35:13.507
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:13.587 --> 00:35:15.589
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:15.629 --> 00:35:18.772
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.321
EDF!

00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:29.782
EDF!

00:35:30.482 --> 00:35:33.924
We played all together last week and we got pretty strong.

00:35:33.944 --> 00:35:39.467
Pretty good at defending the earth but not strong enough to have our senpai join us in game.

00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:47.271
So we're gonna go back and we're gonna see just how strong we can be with Advent plus hololive English senpai with me.

00:35:47.852 --> 00:35:48.772
BAU BAU!

00:35:48.812 --> 00:35:50.173
Please join us!

00:35:50.853 --> 00:35:53.054
And put a schedule!

00:35:53.934 --> 00:35:57.776
After that, on Tuesday we're playing a game called Urayama.

00:35:58.216 --> 00:36:02.418
Gonna go deep into the Japanese countryside.

00:36:02.438 --> 00:36:06.320
And we're gonna have some nice fun.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.501
I hope I don't see anything frightening.

00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:10.842
Not anything too frightening.

00:36:11.382 --> 00:36:13.303
My heart is sort of scary.

00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:17.344
We'll see how it goes.

00:36:18.364 --> 00:36:21.426
Hopefully, at the very least, it's beautiful!

00:36:22.266 --> 00:36:22.426
Yeah!

00:36:23.007 --> 00:36:23.807
I'm excited!

00:36:23.867 --> 00:36:30.031
We have FUWAMOCO Morning followed by Ame-senpai's Valve Game Marathon!

00:36:30.051 --> 00:36:30.251
Yeah!

00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:31.892
We're gonna be doing a Team Fortress 2.

00:36:31.952 --> 00:36:34.413
First time Team Fortress 2 for us!

00:36:34.934 --> 00:36:37.055
And then Garry's Mod together with everybody.

00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:38.296
Garry's Mod was so much fun!

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:38.896
Yeah!

00:36:38.936 --> 00:36:41.397
And we played it for Myth's third anniversary too.

00:36:41.477 --> 00:36:41.818
It's funny.

00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:44.039
In case you don't know, it's like hide and seek.

00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:45.640
Yeah, it was really fun.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.184
And then on Saturday we're having our Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.546
This is how we're gonna end our summer, Ruffians!

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.567
This is the end of summer, okay?

00:36:54.647 --> 00:36:56.989
You know, get your water gun all loaded up.

00:36:57.009 --> 00:36:59.191
Some nice drinks on screen.

00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:00.933
And let's have a summer party, okay?

00:37:00.953 --> 00:37:01.914
Okay!

00:37:02.274 --> 00:37:03.255
BAU BAU!

00:37:04.236 --> 00:37:11.721
And then after that a homework day for us so we're gonna do our best to take a little bit of a moment to be able to get some more sleep and some more work done.

00:37:13.943 --> 00:37:16.105
BAU BAU!

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:20.408
We're the Ruffians who are joining us to the archive today!

00:37:20.428 --> 00:37:23.871
