06:01.716 --> 06:03.176
BAU BAU!

06:03.196 --> 06:03.557
BAU BAU!

06:03.657 --> 06:07.598
It was not our fault!

06:07.698 --> 06:08.978
Okay, something was weird!

06:08.998 --> 06:11.239
The hydraulics were leaking!

06:11.679 --> 06:13.419
BAU BAU!

06:14.059 --> 06:15.620
I'm not a chihuahua!

06:16.460 --> 06:18.141
It's time for... One more time!

06:24.695 --> 06:25.555
One more time, okay?

06:25.575 --> 06:26.276
Give us a moment.

06:26.596 --> 06:27.816
Hello BAU BAU!

06:27.937 --> 06:30.758
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:30.798 --> 06:34.700
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

06:34.920 --> 06:39.662
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.043
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

06:53.669 --> 06:56.613
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

06:56.773 --> 07:00.058
BAU BAU!

07:00.699 --> 07:04.204
And today we are your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:04.224 --> 07:05.947
BAU BAU!

07:05.967 --> 07:08.230
Perfect way to start off the week!

07:09.091 --> 07:09.712
Yo!

07:09.932 --> 07:14.034
A little bit of a funny start, but thank you Ruffians!

07:14.054 --> 07:18.257
Thank you for joining us today for our 138th episode!

07:18.337 --> 07:18.917
Yeah!

07:19.017 --> 07:20.998
FUWAMOCO!

07:22.539 --> 07:26.342
FUWAMOCO!

07:26.442 --> 07:29.444
Look at what's going on FUWAMOCO-chan!

07:29.524 --> 07:30.544
I think things broke.

07:31.545 --> 07:33.246
Nothing to lead to, Ruffians.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.048
We just have to hold on to what we have!

07:36.828 --> 07:37.609
FUWAMOCO!

07:55.111 --> 08:05.457
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

08:05.577 --> 08:05.917
A.K.A.

08:05.997 --> 08:06.878
FUWAMOCO!

08:06.898 --> 08:08.959
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

08:09.639 --> 08:15.463
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.125
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

08:19.305 --> 08:21.266
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

08:21.467 --> 08:25.389
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:25.789 --> 08:28.031
BAU BAU!

08:28.051 --> 08:33.874
Ruffians, do you remember this was the place that you used to... There, there, there!

08:33.894 --> 08:35.175
That's the BAU BAU!

08:35.475 --> 08:35.996
Yeah!

08:36.076 --> 08:39.598
Yeah, you know, I feel like recently I always say let's BAU BAU!

08:39.618 --> 08:42.360
Ruffians are just going hashtag #still.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.591
Do you not want us to say BAU BAU anymore?

08:47.631 --> 08:49.653
Hashtag!

08:50.513 --> 08:51.694
Hashtag!

08:52.094 --> 08:55.757
Let's BAU BAU together, okay, Ruffians?

08:55.957 --> 08:57.618
BAU BAU!

08:57.718 --> 09:03.102
Wow, we've already had a bit of a funny start today, Moco-chan.

09:03.603 --> 09:05.444
Just how silly are things gonna get?

09:06.841 --> 09:07.301
I don't know.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.502
BAU BAU!

09:10.602 --> 09:12.043
BAU BAU!

09:12.083 --> 09:14.863
Wow, it's been a long day!

09:15.044 --> 09:17.204
Another FUWAMOCO Morning!

09:17.324 --> 09:17.964
Hi!

09:18.325 --> 09:20.425
Moco-chan.

09:20.725 --> 09:23.766
What do we have?

09:24.646 --> 09:24.887
What?

09:25.307 --> 09:26.447
Have another Perroccino.

09:26.487 --> 09:29.148
I thought we were gonna start with something else, you know.

09:29.608 --> 09:30.768
More exciting news.

09:32.689 --> 09:33.249
No.

09:33.409 --> 09:33.789
No.

09:34.690 --> 09:35.790
Wow, Ruffians!

09:38.724 --> 09:39.926
Pero Sighting.

09:39.946 --> 09:45.333
I wasn't prepared for this!

09:50.432 --> 09:51.192
These happen.

09:51.212 --> 09:53.273
Sometimes you have to not be prepared.

09:53.333 --> 09:53.774
Hi!

09:54.274 --> 09:55.034
BAU BAU.

09:55.454 --> 09:58.416
Pero, Pero's at the pop-up store.

09:58.436 --> 09:59.096
He just popped up.

09:59.116 --> 10:00.637
Just popped up.

10:00.657 --> 10:01.217
Oh my gosh.

10:01.317 --> 10:04.438
He could not pop up.

10:04.498 --> 10:07.100
What's he doing there with our merch store?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.000
Is he hiding over there?

10:09.601 --> 10:10.721
Is he pero-pero-ing it?

10:11.242 --> 10:12.562
Pero-pero-ing it?

10:13.362 --> 10:15.063
Maybe, you know, maybe he's just helping out.

10:15.143 --> 10:16.244
Restocking it.

10:16.764 --> 10:17.224
You know.

10:17.544 --> 10:18.385
Or maybe...

10:19.431 --> 10:20.212
He's jealous.

10:20.232 --> 10:23.814
They're jealous.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.956
Maybe this is one of his ways to get taken home by the Ruffians.

10:28.297 --> 10:29.858
Don't fall for it, okay?

10:29.898 --> 10:31.359
Ruffians, okay!

10:31.379 --> 10:32.839
You know the petapushies!

10:33.160 --> 10:35.681
They still haven't been released yet!

10:35.921 --> 10:36.642
Okay, don't get confused!

10:36.682 --> 10:39.924
Don't be mistaken, okay?

10:40.484 --> 10:43.966
Just wait a little bit longer, okay?

10:44.006 --> 10:45.127
Not in race!

10:45.688 --> 10:45.788
No!

10:46.751 --> 10:47.536
No!

10:47.939 --> 10:50.013
Yeah, I just made a restock or something whatever.

10:50.633 --> 10:57.236
Yeah, maybe, uh... How about instead you try out one of the FUWAMOCO pillows up there?

10:57.467 --> 10:58.650
Why?

10:58.810 --> 10:59.953
What's softer?

11:00.635 --> 11:01.717
No bones inside.

11:01.877 --> 11:13.344
No bones and then you know no calamities will befall you either, won't they?

11:13.544 --> 11:13.704
Open!

11:13.724 --> 11:16.791
You want to copy a real life Pero, not a plushie?

11:17.426 --> 11:17.526
Right

11:18.738 --> 11:19.399
BAU BAU!

11:19.459 --> 11:20.020
Ruffians!

11:33.965 --> 11:44.868
While we announced last week, we announced the release of Advent's very special horror voice drama, Palemonte Voice!

11:45.088 --> 11:47.668
BAU BAU!

11:48.128 --> 11:54.130
You know, last year, I think it was one of the first things we did after Advent's debut as a unit.

11:54.450 --> 11:58.773
The first thing we did was we released our first horror drama which was The Manor.

11:58.833 --> 11:59.994
The Manor, did you hear it?

12:00.014 --> 12:07.380
I think it's still on sale so you know if you're maybe a new Adventrix and you want to check it out you can check it out still.

12:07.860 --> 12:16.867
Yeah but I know we were really nervous you know it's our first kind of thing but you know so many Adventrix and Ruffians really loved it.

12:17.287 --> 12:21.811
So this year we released a brand new one and that one is

12:22.459 --> 12:24.200
Hale Montereau is here!

12:24.260 --> 12:28.283
But this time, it is extra long.

12:28.704 --> 12:34.528
Extra long, it's a full, well not quite a full, but almost a full hour long drama.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.909
Hour long.

12:35.929 --> 12:39.831
Yeah, and both fans can get the full set of both acts.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.994
I'm pretty sure you want to get both acts because it's the story.

12:43.014 --> 12:45.856
It's kind of like just going to the first half of the movie or just seeing how

12:46.256 --> 12:47.237
The end half of the movie.

12:47.257 --> 12:47.897
You probably want both.

12:48.097 --> 12:49.418
Probably want both.

12:49.678 --> 12:53.521
But if you get the full set, it comes with this key visual.

12:53.621 --> 12:55.402
Here is a wallpaper.

12:55.723 --> 12:59.705
And then also supplemental character settings and information you know.

13:00.026 --> 13:04.469
That's just how detailed, how fleshed out the world is and everything.

13:04.489 --> 13:06.090
It is very intense.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.031
Yeah, it's basically a movie.

13:08.071 --> 13:09.172
Basically.

13:09.212 --> 13:09.652
Basically.

13:09.712 --> 13:11.013
Yeah, an audio novel.

13:11.314 --> 13:11.754
Audio.

13:12.234 --> 13:12.835
Audio novel.

13:12.855 --> 13:14.336
The script must have been long.

13:14.856 --> 13:15.256
Wow!

13:15.316 --> 13:17.837
You can also get the script, I believe.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.437
Yeah, the script comes with it.

13:19.557 --> 13:21.177
It was 71 pages!

13:21.977 --> 13:26.758
Yeah, it is a very full horror voice drama.

13:27.118 --> 13:27.559
But!

13:27.719 --> 13:29.839
Wow, you probably are kind of curious.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.579
What is Palais Montrose?

13:31.599 --> 13:33.180
What exactly is this story?

13:33.260 --> 13:35.260
What is the story?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.481
Wow, the story goes as follows.

13:37.881 --> 13:43.182
The Palais Montrose wants parties, crown jewels, and home to L.M.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.062
Montrose.

13:44.502 --> 13:51.603
The greatest diva alive now stands as a haunting reminder of her mysterious disappearance.

13:52.364 --> 13:58.425
One fateful night, a cash- What a fateful night!

13:58.765 --> 14:00.345
A cash dissembles.

14:01.005 --> 14:04.746
An orphan girl in search of her birth boy, Biboo.

14:04.946 --> 14:09.507
A property manager intent on restoring the reputation of the venue.

14:09.827 --> 14:13.489
If you want to talk to the manager, you have to talk to Mococo.

14:13.509 --> 14:19.411
An esteemed scientist on a crusade against the supernatural.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.412
That sounds like Fuwawa-han.

14:22.232 --> 14:23.973
No supernatural never.

14:25.273 --> 14:31.278
And an up-and-coming diva, looking for answers, seeking justice.

14:31.618 --> 14:32.639
Nerissa!

14:32.739 --> 14:35.521
Although I think she's already a big diva.

14:35.541 --> 14:46.729
Though the four carry the torch of hope and the tools of science, nothing can prepare them for what hides in the shadow of this place.

14:47.009 --> 14:49.170
And of course Shiori is our faithful.

14:49.230 --> 14:52.293
She's our kind of story, our storyteller.

14:52.913 --> 14:55.774
FUWAMOCO Storyteller.

14:55.874 --> 14:59.256
Please check it out, FUWAMOCO fans!

14:59.356 --> 15:00.556
It was really, really fun.

15:00.576 --> 15:04.017
A very different experience than you know.

15:04.057 --> 15:08.519
Like we mentioned, I played the young scientist Celeste.

15:08.679 --> 15:12.361
And Moco-chan, you're the new manager pilot in Montreal, Celeste.

15:14.018 --> 15:17.425
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Celeste!

15:18.126 --> 15:20.991
I'm not Mococo, I'm Celeste!

15:21.692 --> 15:21.933
Yeah.

15:24.793 --> 15:28.436
And together we are Celeste Celeste.

15:30.918 --> 15:36.182
Yo, but Ruffians, can you imagine Fuwawa as a scientist?

15:36.442 --> 15:37.823
Well, you do have to imagine.

15:37.843 --> 15:38.904
You can go with it.

15:38.924 --> 15:39.204
Right.

15:39.364 --> 15:44.769
Yeah, except you know, not only am I a scientist, but I'm a very obnoxious scientist.

15:45.249 --> 15:46.750
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:46.830 --> 15:48.891
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.312
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:50.352 --> 15:51.412
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.788
I'm the manager!

16:12.288 --> 16:13.429
Any complaints?

16:34.571 --> 16:36.854
It's a very interesting voice genre.

16:37.054 --> 16:40.398
You know we all take on very new roles, different characters.

16:40.778 --> 16:42.760
So we hope that you'll check it out all for yourself.

16:43.061 --> 16:46.745
And you know, if the manner is still available then you can listen to the manner.

16:47.848 --> 16:50.651
Oh, this was one year ago and this is now.

16:50.692 --> 16:52.954
Oh, they've improved this much.

16:53.014 --> 16:54.496
Maybe, oh, they haven't improved at all.

16:54.516 --> 16:54.956
It's up to you.

16:54.976 --> 16:57.499
I don't think they've improved a little bit at least.

16:57.539 --> 17:05.908
But both stories in the Palais Montrose and the Manor are different stories, so you don't have to listen to the one last year to enjoy the one this year.

17:06.769 --> 17:07.590
BAU BAU!

17:07.610 --> 17:08.871
That was a lot of fun.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.431
But speaking of fun!

17:37.731 --> 17:43.033
I think the Ruffians have been having a lot of fun at Round1!

17:43.213 --> 17:44.374
Ruffians!

17:44.874 --> 17:51.096
I know you've probably been getting those paws up and going for a walk to Round1 hut!

17:51.136 --> 17:53.437
Together with other hololive listeners too!

17:53.497 --> 17:58.959
And you know we know that many Round1 locations now have their plushies in!

17:59.119 --> 18:02.221
And you know some others don't have to get them yet!

18:04.026 --> 18:09.771
It seems like a lot of the locations also have started to run out of plushies.

18:09.911 --> 18:10.952
Yeah.

18:11.572 --> 18:13.994
As you know, these plushies are very special right now.

18:14.034 --> 18:17.997
The Round1 hololive collab is happening in Japan and the US.

18:18.258 --> 18:21.940
But these ones, the plushies are limited to the US.

18:22.021 --> 18:23.001
Yeah.

18:23.021 --> 18:25.003
Yeah, all the JP Ruffians.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.685
We couldn't get Fuwawa, she was gone already.

18:27.865 --> 18:33.530
I see a lot of Ruffians being like, Fuwawa just doesn't want to go out of the machine.

18:33.890 --> 18:37.995
Are you at the karaoke?

18:38.055 --> 18:40.459
Be careful FUWAMOCO!

18:41.460 --> 18:42.561
It's tricky!

18:42.601 --> 18:45.485
Maybe you have to check back, you know?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.449
But you know, all of them seem to be sort of...

18:48.989 --> 18:49.589
BAU BAU!

19:04.595 --> 19:06.376
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:06.416 --> 19:07.297
FUWAMOCO Morning!

19:21.083 --> 19:22.063
Is this an ad?

19:22.103 --> 19:23.023
It is not an ad!

19:23.063 --> 19:26.824
We're just excited to see you have fun together, okay?

19:49.328 --> 19:55.798
You know, I've heard that some Ruffians are BAU BAUing and the employees are BAU BAU BAUing.

19:55.938 --> 19:59.603
We're just happy, okay?

20:00.084 --> 20:03.449
Please Ruffians, we hope that you have a lot of fun around us.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.112
It just makes us really happy.

20:07.312 --> 20:09.453
And please save us from the machines too, okay?

20:10.073 --> 20:11.534
We trapped her!

20:11.654 --> 20:15.196
Especially on the middle-sized FUWAMOCO plushies!

20:15.216 --> 20:17.017
It seems difficult.

20:17.198 --> 20:21.160
You know there's a floating head FUWAMOCO, the Mocoball.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.140
Mocoball!

20:22.461 --> 20:23.701
I've seen it!

20:23.761 --> 20:26.183
That you can put onto your bags or stairs.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.984
And then there's the middle-sized plushie.

20:29.044 --> 20:32.064
The one that you can take around with you nice and easy.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.985
That's the hardest one to get, so don't let your guard down.

20:35.465 --> 20:38.526
And then the big, big lying down FUWAMOCO!

20:39.046 --> 20:40.487
It seems like he's the easiest.

20:41.027 --> 20:41.287
Yeah.

20:41.767 --> 20:44.608
And also, you're not the easiest to hug, too.

20:44.948 --> 20:46.308
Yeah, yukkuri FUWAMOCO.

20:46.328 --> 20:46.688
That's right.

20:46.728 --> 20:47.168
BAU BAU!

20:47.248 --> 20:51.629
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

20:51.689 --> 20:52.470
Ruffians!

20:52.890 --> 20:53.490
BAU BAU!

20:54.727 --> 20:59.351
Wow, you might have missed it.

20:59.451 --> 21:00.972
It wasn't on our channel.

21:01.412 --> 21:03.174
It wasn't on our schedule.

21:04.315 --> 21:08.718
But the other day, yesterday, we had a special off club.

21:08.738 --> 21:15.304
Our first off club with AZKi-senpai and Iroha-senpai over on Iroha-senpai's channel.

21:15.404 --> 21:16.825
And Iroha-senpai's house too.

21:18.706 --> 21:20.367
It was a lot of fun!

21:20.647 --> 21:23.449
Maybe looking at the thumbnail here, it's hard to understand.

21:23.469 --> 21:25.951
We did something a little bit different.

21:26.291 --> 21:31.434
It was a special collab where Iroha-senpaishi made her famous cookies for us.

21:31.835 --> 21:33.155
But not just normal cookies.

21:33.175 --> 21:35.237
Not normal cookies, it can't be normal, huh?

21:35.297 --> 21:39.780
Yeah, cookies in the shape of different perfections of Japan.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.981
And then we had a battle!

21:42.001 --> 21:43.382
Yes, just like this!

21:43.782 --> 21:46.744
You know, a battle between FUWAMOCO.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.184
This time we're competing.

21:48.204 --> 21:51.066
I thought we were a team for some reason.

21:51.746 --> 22:03.592
But as not to see who can eat as many cookies as possible, first just looking at the shapes, we have to be able to tell which perfection of Japan it is.

22:04.893 --> 22:05.453
Right?

22:05.473 --> 22:08.995
How do you think you would do, Ruffian 5?

22:09.035 --> 22:09.875
You got two guesses!

22:09.915 --> 22:11.436
FUWAMOCO!

22:11.716 --> 22:12.457
FUWAMOCO!

22:13.898 --> 22:14.151
FWMCMORNING.

22:16.697 --> 22:17.478
Yes!

22:17.978 --> 22:18.939
How many did you eat?

22:18.979 --> 22:21.560
We ate so many we are getting full!

22:21.600 --> 22:22.360
They were delicious!

22:22.400 --> 22:23.841
We were getting them all right!

22:23.941 --> 22:24.602
All right!

22:24.622 --> 22:25.722
You know I was.

22:26.943 --> 22:30.805
Moco-chan, that's just because your hand was faster!

22:31.105 --> 22:34.967
I didn't want to say, but maybe Azuki-sensei... No, no, no!

22:35.087 --> 22:35.767
No!

22:35.947 --> 22:38.189
She was being very fair, okay?

22:38.349 --> 22:39.349
I was faster.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.630
BAU BAU!

22:41.750 --> 22:41.851
Yes.

22:44.752 --> 22:46.955
We did pretty well!

22:46.975 --> 22:48.998
We did have some hints here and there.

22:49.339 --> 22:53.705
But TP-senpai, you know, they had to get even more hints before.

22:53.725 --> 22:56.029
And I think there's even perfections that just, I don't know.

22:56.629 --> 22:59.093
But we got through all of them!

22:59.794 --> 23:01.035
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

23:01.095 --> 23:02.136
Have a howl of a day!

23:15.209 --> 23:15.409
Udon.

23:15.429 --> 23:15.750
Yadon.

23:15.770 --> 23:16.150
Slowpoke!

23:16.210 --> 23:17.711
That was Kagawa!

23:18.392 --> 23:20.574
So we're able to eat quite a bit of cookies!

23:33.724 --> 23:47.856
I think the biggest shock though was when AZKi-senpai, when she was like, oh this perfection's known for its mikan oranges and it wasn't Ehime!

23:47.936 --> 23:49.797
It was not Ehime.

23:49.937 --> 23:50.758
It was Hyougoken.

23:50.878 --> 23:51.498
Was it Hyougo?

23:51.518 --> 23:52.499
Was it Wakayama?

23:53.180 --> 23:54.421
No, Hyougoken.

23:54.861 --> 23:55.702
Ah, Hyougoken.

23:56.373 --> 23:57.114
Ramen.

23:57.414 --> 23:58.014
Ume.

23:58.174 --> 24:00.156
Ume and Mikan.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.898
Wakayama-ken was just really hard, right?

24:03.278 --> 24:03.578
Yeah.

24:04.519 --> 24:08.422
But cookies and frosting!

24:08.822 --> 24:12.424
Oh, we did some mountains on them too, and little faces.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.206
That would be really complicated.

24:14.286 --> 24:18.128
AZKi-senpai and Iroha-senpai worked really hard on the cookies.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.529
They did, you know!

24:20.830 --> 24:23.651
We just showed up to Iroha-senpai's house.

24:23.671 --> 24:27.132
I feel bad, but you showed up with, I'm gonna guess and eat cookies, huh?

24:27.352 --> 24:27.752
Right!

24:27.892 --> 24:29.773
And she was like, ah, there's even eggs!

24:29.813 --> 24:31.513
These ones just came out of the oven!

24:31.573 --> 24:31.973
Right!

24:32.013 --> 24:35.354
We wanna eat them, they just came out of the oven, so don't burn your mouth, okay?

24:35.374 --> 24:36.854
Right!

24:36.894 --> 24:40.575
We're just there like, okay, we're just gonna guess the shapes of the cookies.

24:41.036 --> 24:43.656
But it was so much fun, you know?

24:44.256 --> 24:46.257
Just not being able to have fun

24:46.517 --> 24:49.200
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

25:08.618 --> 25:12.202
But AZKi-senpai and Iroha-senpai were both pretty and French.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.924
This seems by our knowledge of Japan.

25:14.944 --> 25:16.225
I'm kind of surprised.

25:16.305 --> 25:18.448
I didn't think you'd do very well.

25:18.468 --> 25:21.751
But it's so hard!

25:21.811 --> 25:23.592
Ruffians, do you think you could do this?

25:23.973 --> 25:28.157
Maybe if it was like the states of America?

25:28.557 --> 25:32.080
Can you tell the states of America if they were cookies?

25:33.603 --> 25:34.744
Yeah, maybe!

25:34.844 --> 25:35.564
Nope.

25:36.084 --> 25:36.304
Nope.

25:36.985 --> 25:37.365
Nope.

25:37.385 --> 25:37.485
Maybe.

25:38.946 --> 25:40.707
Well, you could give it a shot, too!

25:41.087 --> 25:45.289
It's certainly not easy to bake cookies just as beautiful as this, though.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.650
Do your best!

25:46.670 --> 25:49.051
You know how Senpai did an amazing job!

25:49.071 --> 25:51.153
Ruffians, check it out!

25:51.193 --> 25:55.115
Ruffians, if you want to see who wins, you'll have to find out.

25:55.295 --> 25:56.496
BAU BAU!

26:00.457 --> 26:07.720
And, wow, you know FUWAMOCO's beloved mama, Icomochi-mama!

26:07.840 --> 26:13.663
Icomochi-mama has been up to so many exciting things recently!

26:13.683 --> 26:21.586
Right now, she's having a special exhibition for her artwork called "Candy Blue"!

26:21.606 --> 26:24.127
The works are all based off of fairy tales!

26:24.147 --> 26:26.528
They're really, really cute too!

26:26.608 --> 26:27.348
Super duper cute!

26:27.968 --> 26:31.231
Icomochi-mama!

26:31.251 --> 26:36.897
She was even doing signatures at the exhibition too!

26:36.957 --> 26:44.484
Right now it's happening at Hello Culture 4 at the ILLUST GALLERY TOLALA in Umeda!

26:44.504 --> 26:45.985
So not in Tokyo!

26:47.366 --> 26:52.048
Actually, tomorrow is the last day!

26:52.228 --> 26:54.649
I think you have until 5pm.

26:54.669 --> 27:00.731
So, you know, Ruffians, if you're in the area, maybe you can pop in and check it out.

27:00.791 --> 27:11.215
You know, there's a bunch of things going on, lots to see, and also Icomochi-mama released a special book of some of the illustrations featured at this exhibition.

27:12.095 --> 27:14.137
Our boys are here!

27:14.237 --> 27:15.358
Icomochi-mama!

27:15.398 --> 27:18.381
Yeah, we really love Icomochi-mama's works.

27:19.522 --> 27:29.351
But you know, not just has Icomochi-mama been busy with this exhibition, but she's also going to be having a table at the upcoming holocall!

27:29.471 --> 27:37.118
A hololive only doujinshi event that's happening at the very beginning of November on the 10th!

27:37.298 --> 27:38.359
Icomochi-mama!

27:38.819 --> 27:43.503
She'll have some unofficial FUWAMOCO fanworks that she'll be selling there too.

27:43.643 --> 27:45.924
And then, also, look!

27:45.944 --> 27:49.987
She'll have this super cute brand new clear poster!

27:50.048 --> 27:51.108
It's so cute!

27:51.148 --> 27:51.629
Right!

27:51.889 --> 27:55.852
I feel like she'll give me Onyanko Cup by then.

27:56.572 --> 27:59.935
As expected of Icomochi-mama!

28:13.605 --> 28:16.147
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

28:16.167 --> 28:18.889
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

28:18.909 --> 28:20.731
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

28:20.811 --> 28:22.472
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.803
Thank you Icomochi-mama!

28:38.843 --> 28:39.163
BAU BAU!

29:05.758 --> 29:06.919
Wow!

29:07.039 --> 29:08.479
Exciting news, Ruffians!

29:09.540 --> 29:10.420
Elizabeth?

29:11.040 --> 29:14.201
Elizabeth of Justice.

29:14.241 --> 29:16.702
She just had a special announcement!

29:17.202 --> 29:17.623
But!

29:17.843 --> 29:26.386
Elizabeth's going to be releasing a cover of The Beatles' Blackbird on Music Streaming Services very soon!

29:26.466 --> 29:29.687
It's gonna be coming out on the 30th at 9AM GMT!

29:29.767 --> 29:31.468
You know, it's made

29:33.168 --> 29:37.832
You know hololive members, they release covers a lot, right?

29:37.892 --> 29:38.252
But!

29:38.913 --> 29:40.914
This is actually really big, right?

29:41.194 --> 29:47.659
We usually were not able to archive, you know, doing our utawaku, our karaoke streams, our western music.

29:47.679 --> 29:49.100
This is so big!

29:49.140 --> 29:50.641
Right, but this is the Beatles!

29:51.262 --> 29:51.542
Yes!

29:51.882 --> 29:53.804
Right, it's huge!

29:54.184 --> 29:59.368
Right, but you know this is something very new, so we hope that you'll support us.

29:59.868 --> 30:02.333
With this you'll listen to lots and lots.

30:03.295 --> 30:07.704
You know, if we could really cover the western music.

30:08.385 --> 30:09.788
What would you want to hear, Ruffians?

30:12.078 --> 30:14.901
It's been a long time since we've done a... Rock n' Roar Party?

30:14.921 --> 30:15.501
Sabotage!

30:15.541 --> 30:15.681
Aba!

30:16.142 --> 30:17.163
Michael Jackson!

30:17.283 --> 30:18.204
Michael Jackson!

30:18.264 --> 30:18.764
Kawamata!

30:31.857 --> 30:33.118
Oh, crazy vlog!

30:33.779 --> 30:41.610
Wow, it seems like Ruffians have lots of ideas huh!

30:45.876 --> 30:49.317
Love for you so far, Elizabeth!

30:49.477 --> 30:53.459
I'm really excited to listen to it!

30:53.539 --> 30:54.339
It's gonna be so nice!

30:54.379 --> 30:55.620
October 30th, 9am.

30:55.660 --> 30:57.761
Still a little ways away.

30:57.841 --> 30:58.841
9am GMT.

30:58.921 --> 31:00.802
I'm gonna guess it's not like the 29th.

31:00.922 --> 31:03.643
Is this song particularly Halloween-y?

31:03.663 --> 31:04.683
Or is it?

31:04.983 --> 31:06.084
I don't know this song.

31:08.551 --> 31:11.077
I'm sure it's on a MacBook.

31:11.177 --> 31:13.543
Have a Halloween song.

31:13.623 --> 31:15.587
But I don't know.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.612
I don't really know the Beatles either.

31:19.651 --> 31:22.792
Congratulations Elizabeth!

31:22.912 --> 31:29.234
And please check it out on Spotify and other music streaming services soon.

31:29.294 --> 31:30.775
Okay, Ruffians?

31:31.155 --> 31:32.835
BAU BAU!

31:32.855 --> 31:36.436
I didn't know the beginning of Justice!

31:36.536 --> 31:37.377
Halloween!

31:37.697 --> 31:40.498
Well, Justice has something coming up very soon!

31:40.538 --> 31:42.498
Ruffians would invite you to hear!

31:42.518 --> 31:45.239
Yeah, cause you're invited!

31:45.279 --> 31:46.659
You're invited, Ruffians!

31:46.719 --> 31:47.480
You always are.

31:48.980 --> 31:57.043
You might have seen it on our schedule too, but Justice is going to be having a Haunted Mansion investigation.

31:57.464 --> 32:00.145
And it's going to be happening in VRChat!

32:00.345 --> 32:03.666
And of course, FUWAMOCO, we're gonna go too!

32:04.086 --> 32:04.666
It's a trap.

32:04.746 --> 32:05.307
It's not a trap.

32:05.327 --> 32:06.107
They need our help.

32:06.187 --> 32:07.828
It's an investigation, Ruffians.

32:07.868 --> 32:08.608
Why do you think it's a trap?

32:08.648 --> 32:09.528
They're not investigating us.

32:10.109 --> 32:12.529
They're investigating the Haunted Mansion.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.030
They need the help of the fellow hololive members.

32:15.050 --> 32:15.691
They want our help.

32:17.142 --> 32:17.542
Okay.

32:18.463 --> 32:22.864
You know, but it's a haunted mansion investigation.

32:22.924 --> 32:23.044
Yeah.

32:23.504 --> 32:25.765
Not a spooky jumpscare mansion.

32:25.845 --> 32:26.225
Right.

32:26.285 --> 32:27.406
Just haunted, you know.

32:27.446 --> 32:31.607
Maybe DJ will be like... Or something, right?

32:31.667 --> 32:32.888
Yeah.

32:33.288 --> 32:35.409
It's just a cute one, right?

32:35.609 --> 32:36.249
The C.I.A.

32:36.269 --> 32:38.590
will have cobwebs all around and be like... Right?

32:38.890 --> 32:39.130
Right?

32:39.390 --> 32:39.570
Yeah.

32:39.891 --> 32:40.771
That's what I mean.

32:40.831 --> 32:43.632
Ruffians, why are you making that face?

32:43.692 --> 32:44.392
Why?

32:47.758 --> 32:54.163
I'm sure it'll be very fun, very spooky, also cute, not so scary.

32:54.624 --> 33:00.789
Please join us in justice for some Halloween fun, okay?

33:00.869 --> 33:03.692
In the haunted investigation.

33:03.712 --> 33:04.332
BAU BAU!

33:07.522 --> 33:08.463
Ruffians!

33:08.863 --> 33:11.865
Let's check out our Doggie of the Day today!

33:12.286 --> 33:14.748
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Lilli!

33:22.813 --> 33:24.034
Oh, you know Lilli.

33:24.094 --> 33:29.579
Lilli's a little bit of an older girl who's also not a Fuwawa.

33:29.979 --> 33:33.202
She's a Chihuahua!

33:33.322 --> 33:35.503
BAU BAU!

33:35.523 --> 33:37.165
She is a Chihuahua.

33:37.525 --> 33:38.185
She's Lilli!

33:38.306 --> 33:39.807
Moco-chan, how does Lilli BAU BAU?

33:39.847 --> 33:40.087
BAU BAU.

33:50.609 --> 33:52.051
Cute!

33:54.355 --> 33:58.181
Are you dreaming, Lilli?

33:58.201 --> 33:58.241
No.

33:59.343 --> 33:59.584
No?

33:59.804 --> 34:02.108
Let's just you do your best BAU BAUs!

34:02.148 --> 34:02.529
Yes!

34:03.130 --> 34:03.390
Oh!

34:03.550 --> 34:03.971
Okay.

34:04.432 --> 34:05.974
I thought Lilli was dreaming.

34:06.175 --> 34:06.415
No.

34:06.936 --> 34:07.817
Lilli, you know!

34:07.898 --> 34:10.782
Lilli's a very cute grandma!

34:10.822 --> 34:15.671
Who also appreciates the fluff despite not being a Lola.

34:15.711 --> 34:16.632
Not a Lola!

34:17.089 --> 34:19.751
A chihuahua that likes to fluff.

34:21.212 --> 34:25.034
You know we get along despite the differences, right?

34:25.534 --> 34:32.839
She's super cute and you know we wish her lots of comfy, fluffy nubs and even more head pads too!

34:33.319 --> 34:35.820
BAU BAU!

34:35.840 --> 34:41.884
Well, Ruffians, let's take a look at where you've been going for walks recently, huh?

34:42.124 --> 34:44.466
Today, I went on a walk.

34:44.566 --> 34:45.566
Where did we go?

34:45.866 --> 34:46.487
We have...

34:48.185 --> 34:48.325
Oh!

34:48.405 --> 34:48.765
Pumpkin!

34:48.845 --> 34:50.706
Pumpkin patch!

34:50.826 --> 34:54.246
We went to the pumpkin patch together with you!

34:54.586 --> 34:57.247
We're so happy that we could come along!

34:57.467 --> 34:59.047
What kind of pumpkin did you pick out?

34:59.568 --> 35:00.248
Isn't it funny?

35:00.328 --> 35:03.248
I was thinking, what looks rounder, huh?

35:03.888 --> 35:05.189
Pumpkins, huh?

35:05.549 --> 35:06.269
FUWAMOCO.

35:08.549 --> 35:08.789
Huh?

35:09.590 --> 35:10.750
They both look very round.

35:11.170 --> 35:11.290
Oh!

35:13.748 --> 35:15.829
But I don't want the Ruffians carving us.

35:15.929 --> 35:16.349
No!

35:16.389 --> 35:17.909
Don't carve us!

35:18.309 --> 35:21.410
We are supposed to stay exactly as we are!

35:21.970 --> 35:23.330
Yeah!

35:23.891 --> 35:28.172
Well, you know, hopefully you got a pumpkin that's bigger than us!

35:28.232 --> 35:31.232
Because otherwise it might be a little bit hard to carve.

35:31.873 --> 35:37.794
Yeah, but hopefully you have a bunch of Halloween fun decorating it or carving it!

35:38.154 --> 35:40.835
I wonder what you're gonna carve it into, you know?

35:42.025 --> 35:43.527
FUWAMOCO Team Pumpkins!

35:54.395 --> 35:54.756
BAU BAU!

35:54.776 --> 35:55.176
Thank you!

35:55.196 --> 35:57.818
Today's Question of the Day is...

36:13.372 --> 36:14.693
Hi FUWAMOCO!

36:14.833 --> 36:15.013
Hello!

36:15.053 --> 36:20.896
We know your favorite place in the world is Mister Donut in Akihabara.

36:21.416 --> 36:23.677
Can you tell us the story behind it?

36:23.977 --> 36:26.118
What makes it so special to you?

36:26.618 --> 36:27.619
Is it the food?

36:27.719 --> 36:28.679
The location?

36:28.819 --> 36:29.400
Or both?

36:30.700 --> 36:33.201
It's a good question!

36:33.241 --> 36:34.262
You know, of course.

36:34.562 --> 36:37.503
We really love Akihabara so so much!

36:37.583 --> 36:38.944
It's just so much fun!

36:38.984 --> 36:40.645
You know, and naturally after spending

36:41.085 --> 36:43.868
A really fun day of doing a bunch of different things, you know.

36:44.068 --> 36:49.472
Maybe enjoying aisle performances, shopping, maid cafes, you know, some arcades.

36:49.512 --> 36:52.535
You shouldn't need a place to just take it easy.

36:52.595 --> 36:56.819
Right, and there's not really that many of those places in Akihabara.

36:57.339 --> 37:00.602
But Akihabara means to us that place for us.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.844
Yeah, it means relaxation.

37:02.944 --> 37:07.468
And not only that. You know, pon-de-rings of course are our absolute favorite.

37:07.988 --> 37:10.170
But it's really comfy, you know?

37:10.250 --> 37:12.272
It's just the perfect place!

37:12.572 --> 37:22.260
You can go up to the second floor and watch people on the main street from the window and just watch Akihabara and the seasons change and everything, you know?

37:22.280 --> 37:28.666
And you know, even though Akihabara has changed a lot throughout the years, Mister Donut Akihabara, it's always been there!

37:28.686 --> 37:30.167
It's been there, you know?

37:30.207 --> 37:32.829
Just dependable, comfy.

37:33.149 --> 37:34.971
Like your home, you know?

37:34.991 --> 37:35.932
So that's why.

37:36.512 --> 37:37.833
It was our favorite, right?

37:37.873 --> 37:43.797
You know, our comfy home and our favorite town ever, Akihabara!

37:44.297 --> 37:52.522
You know, and that's also why that as soon as we got to Japan, you know, early in the year, we wanted to have that first tour!

37:53.122 --> 37:59.606
And so, but, you know, now this week, we have to say goodbye to that, to Akihabara.

37:59.626 --> 38:01.527
We missed it so much.

38:01.988 --> 38:02.308
Yeah.

38:03.012 --> 38:05.795
So let's end it off with a big BAU BAU!

38:05.855 --> 38:10.601
Goodbye Goodbye Akiba Mistoshi Mocchi Ruffians!

38:11.382 --> 38:14.966
I wish that you could've gone to Ruffians more.

38:16.423 --> 38:18.105
But thank you more for you!

38:18.125 --> 38:18.886
Thank you!

38:18.946 --> 38:20.288
BAU BAU!

38:21.229 --> 38:23.853
A big thank you for all your submissions!

38:24.434 --> 38:24.614
Yes!

38:24.654 --> 38:28.159
Thank you for always remembering the hashtag too!

38:28.239 --> 38:30.401
#FWMCMORNING!

38:30.542 --> 38:41.997
If you have a doggy of a day, maybe you spotted a parrot, or you have a question, or you know you went on a walk and it was an exceptionally good walk, please let us know with that hashtag!

38:42.337 --> 38:45.141
You know FWMC MORNING at the end of the week is gonna be.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.199
Thank you so much BAU BAU!

39:01.786 --> 39:06.548
Well, let's take a look at our schedule here to find out what's the next stream coming up.

39:06.588 --> 39:07.988
We have our schedule!

39:08.008 --> 39:15.510
Next, with the Doggy Pack, we're going to be doing a once-along of a famous Japanese horror movie.

39:15.530 --> 39:18.371
We're going to be watching Dark Water.

39:18.391 --> 39:20.352
I see more FUWAMOCO.

39:20.372 --> 39:20.912
That's really scary.

39:20.932 --> 39:23.713
Really scary.

39:24.093 --> 39:25.214
We just played Visage.

39:25.334 --> 39:27.614
Moco-chan, we're tough demon dogs.

39:27.674 --> 39:29.055
We can do this, you know.

39:30.783 --> 39:34.325
It's like an atmospheric scary.

39:35.105 --> 39:38.126
I don't know.

39:38.827 --> 39:40.047
I'm gonna be ready for it.

39:40.067 --> 39:43.589
It's gonna be fine Moco-chan with the Ruffians, you know.

39:45.089 --> 39:46.210
Don't hold our paws.

39:47.923 --> 39:51.928
Bring a little bit more spookiness into the Halloween season.

40:04.224 --> 40:07.646
And then on Wednesday we have another FUWAMOCO Morning.

40:07.827 --> 40:10.948
And then our Goodbye Akiba Misto stream.

40:10.988 --> 40:12.149
Yeah, please wait for it!

40:12.169 --> 40:14.271
We know it's a bit of a strange time.

40:14.351 --> 40:16.552
It's not really Wednesday, it's sort of Thursday.

40:16.572 --> 40:21.075
It starts at midnight PT, so just as it becomes Thursday.

40:21.575 --> 40:29.200
But we're spending the very last hour of Akiba Misto Open all together, so let's say goodbye to it then.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.721
Justice's Haunted Investigation.

40:32.781 --> 40:34.782
3D Trick or Treating with your Ruffians.

40:45.325 --> 40:46.927
FUWAMOCO Morning before hibernation.

40:46.967 --> 40:47.808
Donkey Kong Country 2.

41:01.303 --> 41:06.629
And then on Saturday, we're gonna be continuing our Minecraft journey!

41:07.370 --> 41:13.858
It's been a while, but if you're a Minecraft pro, or even if you just know a little bit of Minecraft, you can probably help us.

41:13.978 --> 41:20.385
And we very appreciated trying to exist in the world of Minecraft without exceeding necessary.

41:21.582 --> 41:23.663
Please join us, Ruffians!

41:23.723 --> 41:25.564
I don't even remember how, do we?

41:25.945 --> 41:27.045
We'll have to find out!

41:28.546 --> 41:30.587
BAU BAU!

41:31.188 --> 41:39.653
And for the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... It's BAU BAU Blackbird!

41:39.853 --> 41:42.615
BAU BAU!

41:43.315 --> 41:47.938
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

41:48.638 --> 41:55.241
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

41:55.901 --> 41:57.021
Patience Zero!

41:57.261 --> 41:58.862
BAU BAU!

41:58.882 --> 42:00.182
Ex-Human Boy!

42:00.423 --> 42:01.903
BAU BAU!

42:02.023 --> 42:02.703
Chaos!

42:03.164 --> 42:04.144
BAU BAU!

42:04.644 --> 42:08.848
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

42:26.724 --> 42:33.010
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

42:33.291 --> 42:36.094
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

42:36.114 --> 42:38.096
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

42:38.176 --> 42:39.457
BAU BAU!
