## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (06:43)

[ItchyKneeSan](https://twitter.com/IchiNiSan_123_/status/1702514303625257433) found out that Pero is... actually a mother?! Fortunately for FUWAMOCO, it seems that this was just a dream...

## Sad News (09:18)

FUWAMOCO had a ruff night as they were unable to sleep. After sharing their frustration on [a tweet](https://twitter.com/FUWAMOCO_en/status/1706237510979080502), they got a few ideas from Ruffians on how to sleep. They regret that they'll have no time for naps this afternoon.

## Koyori 1 Million Subscribers (13:09)

FUWAMOCO congratulated their fellow holo-canine [Hakui Koyori](https://www.youtube.com/@HakuiKoyori) for reaching 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

## Misunderstanding (14:22)

There was a part during [Mumei's 3D showcase](https://youtu.be/HTgzc9_uAaY) where [Polka gave Mumei a hug](https://youtu.be/HTgzc9_uAaY?t=3354). FUWAMOCO's "That hug......" comment might have given a wrong impression to Ruffians about their feelings, but they just cleared up that the moment caught them by surprise, and they were actually happy for Mumei. No misunderstanding, right?

## Confession (17:09)

Fuwawa found an especially fluffy pupper and, out of instinct, she BAU BAU'd back to them. [Mococo had to give her sister a small reprimand](https://youtu.be/0mS9yvp-SbM?t=1183).

## Today's Challenge (20:05)

Unfortunately for Mococo, another Monday means she has to give natto another go. Three beans this time, no soy sauce. [It went as expected...](https://youtu.be/0mS9yvp-SbM?t=1748)

## Doggie of the Day (30:38)

~~Natto-chan~~ Mococo, still broken for the natto, introduces [@Jamira_4given](https://twitter.com/Jamira_4given/status/1703369779996954982)'s Ozzy to Ruffians, who's also good at breaking, it seems.

## Today I Went On A Walk (32:45)

[ZidanetX](https://twitter.com/ZidanetX/status/1706051534503751845) takes a pleasant autumn walk. FUWAMOCO are surprised that summer has ended already.

## Question Of The Day (33:46)

[debord](https://twitter.com/debordble/status/1705717380041855067) asks if FUWAMOCO has had bad habits, and how did they overcome them? Other than having Mococo trying to overcome her dislike for natto ~~by force~~, FUWAMOCO shares that they were perfectionists to the extreme, and that prevented them from getting things done if they were not perfect rather than just good enough. They encourage us to just do things instead! They also admit that they don't wake up at the right time every day, and they need to work on that.

## Next Stream & Schedule (37:52)

## One More Thing (39:54)

FUWAMOCO tease a surprise for their YT members for tonight.

## Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians (40:33)

25 this time, celebrating their 25th episode.
