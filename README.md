## ‚öíÔ∏è Building

Some of the files here are generated automatically.

1. Media is extracted directly from YouTube along with its metadata. Audio is converted into .wav format for easier processing.
1. Audio is automatically transcribed using a mix of automatic speech recognition plus some manual workarounds to provide the most accurate transcript possible from the get-go.
1. A basic summary is created. A LLM/RAG tool can be leveraged to to summarize the information from the transcript and help with the initial draft.
1. Using the basic summary and metadata from each media, a fancier summary document can be created programatically.
1. An index of all summaries can be automatically generated.
