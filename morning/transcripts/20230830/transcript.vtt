05:02.485 --> 05:05.060
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:05.215 --> 05:08.790
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:08.845 --> 05:12.260
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:14.940 --> 05:17.715
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:17.880 --> 05:20.150
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:20.190 --> 05:23.220
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:27.460 --> 05:32.624
And together we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:32.704 --> 05:40.850
Thank you for joining us today for our 13th episode!

05:41.711 --> 05:48.336
For Ruffians that are maybe joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every

05:48.356 --> 05:50.517
Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

05:50.757 --> 05:52.717
So FUWAMOCO, in case you didn't know.

05:52.757 --> 05:53.678
That's right, it's FUWAMOCO.

05:53.958 --> 05:57.019
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

05:57.459 --> 06:02.860
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:03.120 --> 06:03.620
Ruffians!

06:03.740 --> 06:04.481
Not the left paw.

06:04.521 --> 06:06.421
Not the left, the right paw.

06:06.901 --> 06:12.723
Please remember to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.164
It's up at the top right corner there.

06:16.344 --> 06:22.649
Let's all do our best to BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:22.669 --> 06:25.971
BAU BAU!

06:26.011 --> 06:26.572
Ruffians!

06:26.852 --> 06:27.292
BAU BAU.

06:27.673 --> 06:30.275
Moco-chan.

06:31.475 --> 06:35.178
It seems like there's been another.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.104
Pero Sighting!

06:41.445 --> 06:42.985
I guess he stands out a bit, right?

06:43.326 --> 06:44.066
Maybe just a bit.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.808
Ruffians, you do such a good job finding Pero.

06:47.828 --> 06:48.848
Where is he this time?

06:49.148 --> 06:50.989
Where is he this time?

06:51.009 --> 06:54.451
Where is he in this room?

06:56.152 --> 06:56.392
What?

06:56.632 --> 06:57.612
Where?

06:58.653 --> 06:59.694
Where?

07:00.334 --> 07:02.935
Pero's stuck in this dog's tummy?

07:02.955 --> 07:05.516
What's going on here?

07:05.877 --> 07:06.517
Ruffians!

07:09.392 --> 07:11.574
Wait, how did he get in there?

07:11.895 --> 07:12.996
What are you doing, Pero?

07:16.860 --> 07:17.681
Is this dog sick?

07:20.192 --> 07:22.874
Pero, Pero?

07:23.634 --> 07:24.314
Maybe sick.

07:24.334 --> 07:25.935
Maybe sick?

07:27.976 --> 07:29.077
I hope this dog's okay.

07:29.097 --> 07:33.699
I hope this isn't another symptom of BAU BAU-byo.

07:33.779 --> 07:34.800
What's up, Ruffians?

07:34.860 --> 07:35.520
You're next!

07:35.720 --> 07:36.581
We are next!

07:38.802 --> 07:41.504
I don't like the feeling I get from this photo.

07:41.964 --> 07:43.064
It's very unsettling.

07:43.345 --> 07:43.685
Right?

07:44.145 --> 07:46.426
Is the doggy going to rescue him?

07:47.427 --> 07:47.687
Maybe?

07:49.104 --> 07:50.869
What's gonna happen to the dog though?

07:51.210 --> 07:53.516
Is this what happens in the back rooms?

07:55.393 --> 07:56.814
Maybe it's related?

07:57.274 --> 07:58.434
Transportation.

07:58.714 --> 08:00.835
Ruffians, do you have any answers?

08:01.755 --> 08:04.296
Maybe there's some doctors in the audience?

08:04.817 --> 08:05.517
Doctors!

08:05.637 --> 08:07.898
Can you explain?

08:08.338 --> 08:09.538
I obviously don't understand.

08:09.558 --> 08:10.759
I'm not seeing any good answers.

08:10.919 --> 08:11.199
No.

08:11.779 --> 08:12.239
Rebirth.

08:12.759 --> 08:13.680
That's not an answer.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.380
Rebirth.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.761
Pero is baby.

08:17.341 --> 08:18.141
Like this dog.

08:18.181 --> 08:19.222
Very rude, baby.

08:20.999 --> 08:23.420
I don't think that's how it works, Ruffians.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.660
I don't think so.

08:24.680 --> 08:24.840
No.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.001
Hoping for the best.

08:27.121 --> 08:27.401
Yes!

08:27.962 --> 08:33.064
I feel like this is our most unsettling and intense Pero Sighting yet.

08:33.784 --> 08:34.405
What do you think?

08:37.304 --> 08:37.844
I don't know.

08:38.264 --> 08:43.827
Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more sightings, okay?

08:43.947 --> 08:45.007
Or an explanation.

08:45.027 --> 08:46.508
Or an explanation, yeah.

08:46.928 --> 08:50.529
Remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

08:50.849 --> 08:52.790
That was disturbing.

08:52.810 --> 08:56.271
That was a disturbing way to start our morning.

08:56.331 --> 08:57.052
Just a bit!

08:57.312 --> 08:58.012
It's gone now!

08:58.152 --> 08:59.373
Let's all think about it.

09:00.753 --> 09:01.253
It's over.

09:01.273 --> 09:02.094
Okay.

09:02.594 --> 09:04.214
On to the Happy Puddin' FUWAMOCO Morning.

09:05.875 --> 09:06.897
It's not the happy part.

09:07.457 --> 09:07.698
What?

09:08.218 --> 09:09.340
It's not the happy part.

09:10.061 --> 09:11.182
Not the happy part?

09:11.402 --> 09:12.083
Ruffians.

09:12.303 --> 09:14.646
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, always all happy part!

09:14.786 --> 09:20.553
We have another... A misunderstanding, huh?

09:21.254 --> 09:21.555
Yeah.

09:22.035 --> 09:22.235
So!

09:23.539 --> 09:27.680
I wanted to say, this misunderstanding was again.

09:28.320 --> 09:28.620
Again.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.761
During our chat with all of Abyss.

09:31.021 --> 09:34.622
During the first day of the Splash Party Potsuwa.

09:36.382 --> 09:37.942
I was really confused, you know?

09:37.962 --> 09:41.103
Were you Ruffians?

09:42.343 --> 09:43.324
Were you confused?

09:43.344 --> 09:43.784
Do you know?

09:43.804 --> 09:45.384
Do you know what it is?

09:45.744 --> 09:46.885
Do you know what happened?

09:49.905 --> 09:50.725
I'm not seeing it.

09:52.226 --> 09:52.766
I'm not.

09:53.413 --> 09:55.454
So... Then it's important we talk about it today.

09:55.654 --> 09:56.234
Yeah, yeah!

09:56.274 --> 09:57.135
Have to clear it, you know?

09:57.155 --> 09:57.515
Yeah.

09:57.995 --> 10:04.118
So Nuresai... She was talking about... What kind of... Of rice... That she likes.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.280
And, you know... She seemed really hungry, so... She was hungry.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.000
You know, I wanted to make her hungrier.

10:10.020 --> 10:10.261
Yeah.

10:10.701 --> 10:12.942
And... I was playing with her like, Open up!

10:13.162 --> 10:14.122
I'm the mama bird!

10:14.322 --> 10:15.143
Here comes the rice!

10:15.303 --> 10:16.303
It's piping hot!

10:16.804 --> 10:22.046
And... And... You know... Then... Then she started...

10:23.743 --> 10:24.245
Morning.

10:24.265 --> 10:26.089
B-morning!

10:27.293 --> 10:28.937
And I was really confused.

10:31.420 --> 10:31.740
Right.

10:32.461 --> 10:33.621
That would be cool.

10:34.002 --> 10:41.406
And you know, I even saw comments on videos of it saying things like, Mococo is doing this on purpose!

10:41.927 --> 10:45.109
And that I'm going to become like, some of our senpai.

10:46.009 --> 10:46.429
Yeah.

10:46.449 --> 10:52.513
I saw a comment that Moco-chan's like, Matsuri-senpai tweeting.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.075
She's gonna become Matsuri-senpai!

10:56.980 --> 10:57.620
Ruffians!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.781
That's kind of rude to Matsuri-senpai, right?

11:01.281 --> 11:03.562
Matsuri-senpai is Matsuri-senpai.

11:04.002 --> 11:06.582
And she does what she does wonderfully, you know?

11:06.602 --> 11:09.923
Moco-chan, you can't become Matsuri-senpai.

11:09.983 --> 11:11.584
I don't know if I want that.

11:12.264 --> 11:13.584
Moco-chan, that's rude.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.305
I'm Mococo, okay?

11:17.465 --> 11:18.385
She's Mococo.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.726
It both starts with an M, but it's totally different, okay?

11:23.907 --> 11:25.287
You know...

11:26.576 --> 11:28.318
All I know is that I was framed.

11:28.338 --> 11:32.623
I was just trying to be Mama Bird for Nurses Baby Bird.

11:32.663 --> 11:34.305
That was where you made the mistake.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.482
If you look, if you look, you can see my expression.

11:38.542 --> 11:39.683
I'm very confused.

11:39.763 --> 11:40.683
I'm very hurt.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.243
Okay.

11:41.744 --> 11:42.464
Go watch!

11:42.904 --> 11:43.585
You can see.

11:43.725 --> 11:44.845
There's footage.

11:44.885 --> 11:48.908
There's evidence of me being very confused.

11:49.368 --> 11:50.749
You got hurt by her moans.

11:50.789 --> 11:51.509
Moco-chan.

11:51.589 --> 11:52.189
I was hurt.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.211
Yeah.

11:54.291 --> 11:54.611
Yeah.

11:54.951 --> 11:55.371
Okay.

11:56.192 --> 11:56.832
I was framed.

11:57.692 --> 11:58.973
Understood.

11:59.273 --> 12:00.674
Misunderstanding clear.

12:01.474 --> 12:02.135
You get it now.

12:06.891 --> 12:07.171
Good.

12:07.872 --> 12:08.192
Good.

12:09.692 --> 12:09.792
Yes!

12:09.852 --> 12:10.412
Innocent!

12:10.532 --> 12:11.392
Innocent!

12:11.512 --> 12:11.792
Okay!

12:11.812 --> 12:13.233
Yeah, we're innocent puppies.

12:13.413 --> 12:14.693
Always are forever.

12:15.913 --> 12:16.233
Got it.

12:16.753 --> 12:17.013
Yeah.

12:17.893 --> 12:18.354
Not really.

12:18.374 --> 12:19.954
That's your problem.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.574
It's clear now!

12:23.054 --> 12:24.875
BAU BAU!

12:26.995 --> 12:29.076
So that means only happy things now, right?

12:29.296 --> 12:29.536
Yeah.

12:29.796 --> 12:30.816
No more sad things.

12:31.036 --> 12:31.136
No.

12:32.892 --> 12:35.713
Now onto the happy part.

12:36.473 --> 12:39.374
I actually have something else I need to talk about.

12:39.394 --> 12:42.514
Something else?

12:43.855 --> 12:45.015
Maybe it's not happy.

12:45.075 --> 12:45.555
What?!

12:46.135 --> 12:50.676
It's something really, really important, okay, Ruffians?

12:51.276 --> 12:52.997
And it's a bit embarrassing.

12:53.457 --> 12:56.417
A bit for me, but maybe more for someone else.

12:56.437 --> 12:57.958
For someone else?

12:58.178 --> 12:58.458
Nerissa!

13:02.639 --> 13:06.462
You know, we uploaded our Holo Summer Shorts, right?

13:07.503 --> 13:07.843
Yeah.

13:08.984 --> 13:11.226
I have something important to share.

13:12.146 --> 13:16.170
So... Holo Summer Shorts.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.091
This person's not gonna be very happy.

13:21.465 --> 13:21.645
What?

13:22.346 --> 13:25.089
Fuwawa exposed me!

13:25.189 --> 13:25.529
What?

13:25.950 --> 13:27.932
It's a picture of you, not me.

13:28.072 --> 13:30.834
Fuwawa doesn't know, but I caught her.

13:30.855 --> 13:32.356
What?

13:32.877 --> 13:36.640
She keeps on watching my shorts over and over and over.

13:38.202 --> 13:42.706
You know, I'll call for her, and then I hear the splashing sounds from my video.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.725
And I keep on asking her why.

13:46.185 --> 13:48.087
And she says, oh, I just want to watch it.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.748
I just want to watch it, Mococo.

13:49.768 --> 13:53.911
And then she has a silly expression, a silly smile on her face.

13:54.011 --> 13:56.313
I just, I can't help it, Ruffians!

13:56.353 --> 13:58.375
You know, it's really cute!

13:58.395 --> 14:01.097
Ruffians, you feel the same way, right?

14:01.137 --> 14:02.998
It's making you feel the same way.

14:03.659 --> 14:07.122
You were watching lots and lots with a silly smile on your face, maybe, too.

14:07.182 --> 14:07.722
Right?

14:08.022 --> 14:08.423
Right?

14:10.919 --> 14:11.379
Right!

14:12.020 --> 14:13.441
You get it right!

14:13.761 --> 14:14.581
It's cute!

14:14.621 --> 14:16.082
It just can't be helped!

14:18.203 --> 14:18.683
I don't know.

14:18.703 --> 14:21.985
I feel like, you know, it's a must watch.

14:22.005 --> 14:24.067
50 times kind of sweat.

14:24.227 --> 14:25.267
One time, oh it's cute.

14:25.527 --> 14:26.128
Two times, oh it's cute!

14:26.148 --> 14:26.988
You think it's that good?

14:27.008 --> 14:28.249
Three times, it's really cute!

14:28.309 --> 14:29.670
You think it's that good?

14:29.910 --> 14:30.370
It's cute.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.031
It's my sister.

14:34.292 --> 14:38.314
You know, especially when Moco-chan laughs and then splashes.

14:38.774 --> 14:42.295
And then, you know, she kind of gets a bit more of a ram.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.776
Moco-chan, spicy!

14:43.796 --> 14:44.576
Spicy?

14:44.636 --> 14:45.696
I'm never spicy.

14:45.716 --> 14:47.937
Never spicy.

14:48.057 --> 14:48.738
Ruffians!

14:48.998 --> 14:52.019
Make sure, if you haven't checked it out yet, that you watch it, okay?

14:52.479 --> 14:54.180
Maybe 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, 50 times!

14:54.200 --> 14:54.380
100 times!

14:54.400 --> 14:54.580
500,000 times!

14:54.860 --> 14:56.660
Yeah, make sure you watch FUWAMOCO too, okay?

15:02.284 --> 15:03.929
FUWAMOCO-chan, you should be proud!

15:04.450 --> 15:05.433
You should be proud!

15:05.453 --> 15:06.396
Of what?

15:07.236 --> 15:08.737
Of your splashing.

15:09.357 --> 15:10.397
I did a good job splashing.

15:10.417 --> 15:11.218
You did, you did.

15:11.238 --> 15:15.479
You got us all thoroughly splashed.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.461
The next thing we wanted to talk about today.

15:20.902 --> 15:21.422
This!

15:21.762 --> 15:23.062
This, this, this!

15:23.363 --> 15:27.464
We've received a lot of questions from you Ruffians about our claws.

15:27.564 --> 15:28.945
Our magic claws.

15:29.585 --> 15:30.305
Very important.

15:30.325 --> 15:31.826
They're magic claws.

15:31.906 --> 15:33.807
Here's a bit more information about them.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.127
You might have seen it.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.088
Right, right!

15:37.148 --> 15:38.630
So, aren't they pretty?

15:38.650 --> 15:39.691
Aren't they cool?

15:40.653 --> 15:43.476
Mine are very good too.

15:43.556 --> 15:46.660
I bet you wish you could have some too.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.782
Ruffians?

15:47.902 --> 15:49.163
Yeah, Ruffians.

15:49.204 --> 15:50.065
You can't though.

15:51.627 --> 15:54.590
But, most importantly, they used...

15:55.832 --> 16:00.537
They're most necessary, you know, as part of our job as Demon Guard Dogs.

16:00.637 --> 16:07.424
But I feel like, at least, as far as protecting your smile goes, they don't really have that much of a use right now.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.446
But, you know, that's a good thing!

16:09.646 --> 16:11.668
Yeah, good thing, right?

16:11.728 --> 16:12.349
No violence.

16:12.669 --> 16:15.152
I think, you know, Ruffians, if you got a taste of them,

16:16.112 --> 16:18.473
Ah, your smile might be gone for good.

16:18.593 --> 16:19.553
A bit, a bit.

16:20.293 --> 16:20.713
Yeah.

16:20.733 --> 16:21.953
They might have a couple smiles.

16:21.973 --> 16:22.253
They hurt.

16:22.474 --> 16:23.294
They hurt, you know.

16:23.574 --> 16:24.594
Yeah, you might have a couple smiles.

16:24.654 --> 16:26.254
A couple smiles now, huh?

16:26.434 --> 16:26.774
Huh?

16:26.834 --> 16:29.455
But yeah, we don't really need them, you know.

16:29.815 --> 16:32.576
When we're taking it easy and relaxing with you.

16:33.076 --> 16:33.576
Yeah, but.

16:33.856 --> 16:34.136
Yeah.

16:34.896 --> 16:36.377
We can put them away, so.

16:36.497 --> 16:37.157
If we want to.

16:37.417 --> 16:38.137
They're always there.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.419
Whenever we want them.

16:40.619 --> 16:42.200
But we didn't always have them though.

16:42.960 --> 16:48.404
You know, only after we got to a certain level in our Demon Dog Training, that we got them.

16:48.704 --> 16:51.286
You know, it happened when we got our claws too.

16:51.526 --> 16:53.588
Important part of Guard Dog Training, you know?

16:53.608 --> 16:59.412
And the strength of our claws is directly linked to the gem on the end of the claws just here.

17:00.072 --> 17:01.513
A gem, very important.

17:02.794 --> 17:14.716
Yeah, you know, uh... But... It's a bit annoying because Pero... Pero still likes to complain that we need to work harder to be able to get our claws much stronger.

17:14.736 --> 17:16.677
I think it's pretty good.

17:16.777 --> 17:18.657
I don't think we're weak at all, you know?

17:18.737 --> 17:22.578
I think the Ruffians would think that they're very, very sharp.

17:22.878 --> 17:23.618
Yeah, they're strong.

17:23.658 --> 17:24.518
They're strong for now.

17:25.039 --> 17:29.219
We don't need them that much to be able to protect your smiles, so... Hopefully.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.820
Yeah, unless something really scary comes along.

17:33.933 --> 17:35.494
But that shouldn't happen, right?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.095
That shouldn't happen, right?

17:37.475 --> 17:41.558
Ruffians, you're not gonna make us use the legacy, right?

17:44.199 --> 17:45.960
Yeah, I don't think you want that.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.001
I don't think you will last.

17:48.182 --> 17:50.283
So, make sure you praise!

17:50.423 --> 17:51.344
Praise Moco-chan!

17:51.384 --> 17:53.085
Moco-chan, is that a threat?

17:57.977 --> 17:58.757
Right?

17:59.458 --> 18:01.518
Right?

18:02.099 --> 18:02.419
Yeah.

18:02.759 --> 18:05.280
No, no Berserker BAU BAUbers.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.262
Yeah, I wouldn't recommend them for back itching either.

18:11.062 --> 18:11.782
No, no, no.

18:12.262 --> 18:16.744
For those times, a twin is helpful.

18:16.884 --> 18:18.505
Moco-chan's good at back itching.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.626
This is regular.

18:20.666 --> 18:21.166
Regular.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.406
Regular quiz.

18:22.426 --> 18:22.566
Yeah.

18:22.626 --> 18:22.706
One!

18:27.739 --> 18:31.983
Ah, well, we also, we thought it was important that we talk about this today.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.804
But this might be a bit more important.

18:35.465 --> 18:40.990
You know, we've mentioned it a bunch, but, but, we really like ponderings.

18:41.170 --> 18:42.131
In case you didn't know.

18:42.491 --> 18:44.553
Ruffians, you remember what they are, right?

18:44.633 --> 18:45.073
Right!

18:45.253 --> 18:45.534
Right?

18:46.154 --> 18:47.195
The ponderings.

18:51.957 --> 18:52.638
Yes, yes!

18:52.718 --> 18:53.799
Pondering, yes!

18:54.119 --> 18:55.120
Yeah, pondering.

18:55.420 --> 19:00.444
It's a donut that's like super mochi-mochi like and chewy!

19:00.624 --> 19:03.326
But honestly, it's much more than just that.

19:03.346 --> 19:04.307
It doesn't compare.

19:04.787 --> 19:06.109
Ruffies, do you like donuts?

19:07.249 --> 19:07.530
Do you?

19:09.295 --> 19:10.777
Because you don't have to like donuts.

19:11.157 --> 19:13.179
To be honest, we're kind of mixed on them.

19:13.199 --> 19:21.969
Donuts are like... I guess they're yummy, but... Because of that, we kind of feel like it's unfair to call ponderings donuts.

19:22.109 --> 19:23.010
It's better than that.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.672
Pondering is a pondering!

19:25.593 --> 19:26.694
They're in their own class.

19:26.754 --> 19:27.635
They're like bulls.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.858
That's good, but ponderings are better.

19:29.938 --> 19:30.318
They're better.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.040
I don't know!

19:32.540 --> 19:34.762
They kind of look like a dog toilet.

19:34.882 --> 19:35.942
They're really chewy!

19:35.962 --> 19:36.943
You know?

19:36.963 --> 19:42.807
The reason why it looks chewy is because it's CHEWY!

19:42.987 --> 19:43.627
Yeah!

19:43.988 --> 19:45.188
And it's really soft, too.

19:45.308 --> 19:46.809
There's different flavors!

19:47.230 --> 19:50.032
Like strawberry, or chocolate, or matcha sauce.

19:50.052 --> 19:51.533
You don't have to have a chocolate one.

19:51.573 --> 19:52.113
Yeah, no.

19:52.613 --> 19:54.755
But our favorite is just plain.

19:54.895 --> 19:57.196
You know, it's slightly sweet.

19:57.577 --> 19:58.697
Yeah, you can't beat it.

19:58.777 --> 19:59.458
It's just perfect.

20:00.178 --> 20:01.420
Perfectly sweet.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.901
Good balance.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.886
But because of that, you know, I feel like you never really get tired because of it.

20:07.966 --> 20:08.627
Exactly!

20:08.647 --> 20:11.970
Perfectly sweet, so you could have something that's a bit more like bitter.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.031
Yeah, good balance.

20:13.311 --> 20:14.733
I wouldn't want to have soda with it.

20:15.493 --> 20:17.195
That would be disgusting.

20:17.255 --> 20:20.657
Unless you're maybe like a very strong sweetness Ruffian.

20:21.318 --> 20:23.499
I think we're pretty strong, but I'm not that way.

20:23.539 --> 20:25.241
Not that strong, no.

20:25.761 --> 20:29.384
Because you know they're just perfectly sweet, you could eat a bunch of them!

20:29.404 --> 20:30.505
A bunch of them!

20:30.605 --> 20:32.746
I guess for better or worse.

20:33.907 --> 20:41.613
Ruffians, can you guess what a normal order of pawings would be for us while we are both doing guard dog training?

20:41.633 --> 20:44.195
Huh?

20:45.131 --> 20:47.294
A hundred and one?

20:47.755 --> 20:47.995
No.

20:48.035 --> 20:50.779
That's a bit difficult.

20:51.440 --> 20:51.901
A dozen?

20:53.223 --> 20:53.764
Twenty each?

20:54.765 --> 20:54.965
Ten!

21:01.460 --> 21:03.403
It's a pool box.

21:03.543 --> 21:04.844
A pool box!

21:05.085 --> 21:07.988
They give you a special box, like a pondering box?

21:08.509 --> 21:10.992
I don't know, it looks kind of like a... I think it's a normal donut box.

21:11.012 --> 21:13.535
But if you only fill it up with pondering, then it's a pondering box.

21:13.776 --> 21:17.580
It looks special, like you know that you're transporting them across the country.

21:17.600 --> 21:17.981
Right!

21:18.161 --> 21:19.022
Very official.

21:21.284 --> 21:26.228
But we also make sure that we run a round of bites so they don't have a negative effect or anything.

21:26.288 --> 21:28.410
Yeah, you know when you're doing training, it's okay.

21:28.810 --> 21:31.672
But it's not like ponderings would ever do anything horrible to you.

21:31.732 --> 21:33.353
No, they only are good stuff.

21:33.373 --> 21:35.935
They only bring smiles, you know?

21:36.376 --> 21:38.017
It's like a special smile soup, right?

21:38.197 --> 21:41.299
Right, when you look at them, they make you happy, they make you smile.

21:41.439 --> 21:45.983
And then when you eat them, you take a... You get even a bigger smile!

21:47.892 --> 21:48.692
Ah, yeah.

21:49.012 --> 21:52.474
You know, they have a lot of the different, like, the pawns, the pawns.

21:52.534 --> 21:53.095
How many pawns?

21:53.195 --> 21:53.635
Eight pawns?

21:53.655 --> 21:53.635
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

21:55.536 --> 21:57.478
I'm memorizing.

21:57.738 --> 21:58.318
Eight pawns.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.059
If it doesn't have eight, it's not right.

22:00.099 --> 22:01.220
Yeah, it needs to be the eight.

22:01.400 --> 22:01.960
Eight pawns.

22:02.080 --> 22:02.361
Yeah.

22:02.461 --> 22:03.601
So you can eat them slowly.

22:03.701 --> 22:04.302
And share!

22:04.322 --> 22:05.462
Right, that too.

22:05.502 --> 22:08.344
Because you know, you can divide eight by two.

22:08.364 --> 22:10.746
I can too, but we don't do that.

22:11.486 --> 22:12.387
But it's possible.

22:12.407 --> 22:14.568
If you need it to be there, you can.

22:14.808 --> 22:17.830
And you can share it equally because you know there's eight.

22:17.970 --> 22:18.850
There's eight.

22:18.890 --> 22:23.593
Yeah, and then the other good thing about Ponderings is that there's a king!

22:23.613 --> 22:25.094
A king of Ponderings.

22:25.534 --> 22:26.454
He's very cute.

22:27.075 --> 22:29.776
I want to know actually, Ruffians, do you know his name?

22:30.537 --> 22:31.037
The king.

22:31.197 --> 22:33.838
I think we talked about him too earlier.

22:34.319 --> 22:37.240
Maybe that was during our Japanese Latsudance too?

22:37.300 --> 22:37.721
Maybe.

22:38.081 --> 22:38.481
Maybe.

22:40.032 --> 22:40.633
Pondelion!

22:40.993 --> 22:43.295
He's the king!

22:45.357 --> 22:48.300
He's the king of the Ponderings, the Pondelion.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.564
You know there's a bunch of mascots, but he's the best.

22:51.624 --> 22:52.725
Pondelion's the best.

22:53.085 --> 22:55.548
What were the other ones?

22:55.928 --> 22:57.029
Honeycooler.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.591
Honeywooler!

22:58.631 --> 22:59.231
Honeywooler!

22:59.271 --> 23:00.793
Honeywooler!

23:01.794 --> 23:03.536
I can't remember the other one.

23:05.312 --> 23:11.784
But you know, I feel like it would be nice if we could be like the twin demon dogs upon the rings.

23:12.585 --> 23:14.649
You know he's the king, we're the twin demon dogs.

23:16.184 --> 23:18.346
I feel like we work well together, you know?

23:18.386 --> 23:21.469
We bring smiles, we protect them, right?

23:21.609 --> 23:22.990
It's a perfect balance!

23:23.991 --> 23:28.274
So Ruffians, if you see Ponda Rings around, please have at least one.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.696
Yeah, think about us, okay?

23:29.716 --> 23:30.697
When you eat them, right?

23:30.737 --> 23:34.340
But remember, you can tell a true Ponda Ring by how many of the ponds it has.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.000
Eight.

23:35.441 --> 23:36.381
Eight.

23:36.461 --> 23:36.922
Important.

23:37.262 --> 23:37.662
Okay?

23:37.743 --> 23:39.424
BAU BAU!

23:40.065 --> 23:40.585
Ponda BAU!

23:40.605 --> 23:41.145
Ponda BAU!

23:41.186 --> 23:41.646
Ponda BAU.

23:43.715 --> 23:44.376
This is so good.

23:44.636 --> 23:46.257
I can taste it right now.

23:46.277 --> 23:49.940
It's good.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.341
Almost as delicious as cats.

23:52.742 --> 23:52.982
And next!

23:58.370 --> 24:01.013
FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

24:01.073 --> 24:02.013
Ruffians!

24:02.234 --> 24:07.538
As you might know, we're looking for a jingle from you for FUWAMOCO Morning.

24:07.558 --> 24:12.002
We wanted to say again thank you for so many wonderful submissions.

24:12.302 --> 24:14.484
We've been listening to a bunch of them.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.706
They're all so so so unique.

24:18.927 --> 24:26.052
But we can only decide on one jingle, so... I think we'd like to showcase a bunch of them too, you know?

24:26.072 --> 24:29.854
They're all so great, so I feel really mixed.

24:30.294 --> 24:30.535
Yeah.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.696
Does that sound fun, ruffians?

24:33.296 --> 24:33.897
Showcase?

24:34.077 --> 24:35.117
Showcase some of them too!

24:36.374 --> 24:37.055
Is that good?

24:37.655 --> 24:37.975
Yes!

24:38.155 --> 24:38.456
Yes!

24:39.276 --> 24:40.077
Okay!

24:40.237 --> 24:41.478
Good, good, good, good.

24:42.599 --> 24:49.384
But we also wanted to mention for creators, again, we're planning to use the jingle at the very beginning of each episode.

24:49.765 --> 24:58.492
So, you know, once we transition to the studio and we play just right before we go, holo holo BAU BAU!

24:58.532 --> 24:59.332
You know?

24:59.633 --> 25:00.533
Just right there.

25:00.653 --> 25:00.874
Yeah.

25:02.769 --> 25:06.871
And also a reminder, the third line is quickly approaching.

25:07.211 --> 25:09.152
It's on September 3rd.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.273
So don't forget, okay?

25:12.573 --> 25:13.214
Be careful.

25:13.634 --> 25:15.775
It's almost September.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.096
Almost.

25:19.256 --> 25:24.498
Let's all bring close to August together and make September the best month we can.

25:25.538 --> 25:25.839
Ever!

25:25.879 --> 25:26.559
The best month ever.

25:30.322 --> 25:36.746
Well, I think it's time for our Regular Corner's Doggie of the Day!

25:36.826 --> 25:37.527
BAU BAU BAU!

25:37.767 --> 25:39.688
Who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

25:39.788 --> 25:40.849
We'll see.

25:40.909 --> 25:41.570
De-den!

25:43.851 --> 25:45.552
It's Coco!

25:45.612 --> 25:46.293
Not Mococo.

25:46.733 --> 25:47.553
Coco!

25:47.853 --> 25:48.854
I'm not Doggie of the Day.

25:48.994 --> 25:49.994
You're not Doggie of the Day.

25:50.014 --> 25:51.335
You're never Doggie of the Day.

25:51.595 --> 25:53.455
I'm always Doggie of the Day.

25:53.475 --> 25:53.535
Huh?

25:54.016 --> 25:54.216
No!

25:54.576 --> 25:56.276
Coco is Doggie of the Day today.

25:57.117 --> 26:03.179
Coco is very sleepy after being woken up early in the morning doing Splash Party Day 2.

26:03.659 --> 26:04.319
I see.

26:04.339 --> 26:05.839
Get a good rest, Coco!

26:05.859 --> 26:05.999
Yeah!

26:06.240 --> 26:07.160
Whatever, Mococo.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.279
Well, I don't know.

26:10.519 --> 26:14.221
Moco-chan, maybe you feel similar to Coco.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.362
You sympathize a bit.

26:15.762 --> 26:16.843
Yeah, I feel like this.

26:17.283 --> 26:19.385
I feel like this right... Not right now.

26:20.926 --> 26:22.547
Not right now, but recently.

26:22.567 --> 26:24.628
Maybe on Splash Party Day too.

26:24.888 --> 26:25.569
Maybe a bit.

26:25.809 --> 26:28.251
Same expression.

26:28.471 --> 26:34.055
It's good, you know, that this Ruffian snapped a photo of Coco's sleeping face and not Mococo's.

26:35.736 --> 26:38.918
I don't think Moco-chan would be nearly as cute.

26:39.738 --> 26:41.359
I would be a bit more angry looking.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.280
That's for sure.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.661
Maybe some drool.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.802
Your tail would be all fuzzy.

26:48.622 --> 26:49.163
You know?

26:49.763 --> 26:50.083
Right?

26:50.323 --> 26:51.244
Is that a problem?

26:51.504 --> 26:52.344
That's a problem.

26:52.644 --> 26:53.825
Ruffians don't want to see that.

26:56.836 --> 26:58.537
What's that angry face for?

26:58.617 --> 26:59.538
See, that's even better!

27:00.438 --> 27:01.159
I told you so.

27:01.839 --> 27:04.221
Coco's sleeping face is the cutest.

27:04.261 --> 27:08.103
Not to be confused with Moco-chan.

27:08.484 --> 27:10.345
How does Coco BAU BAU?

27:10.565 --> 27:14.888
You know, like maybe a half asleep BAU BAU, or like sleeping BAU BAU.

27:14.908 --> 27:16.609
Oh boy.

27:16.709 --> 27:17.109
Oh boy.

27:18.882 --> 27:19.983
BAU BAU.

27:20.623 --> 27:21.324
BAU BAU.

27:21.404 --> 27:22.244
I just woke up.

27:22.445 --> 27:24.506
You woke me up because of the splash party.

27:24.546 --> 27:25.407
BAU BAU.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.448
BAU BAU.

27:26.788 --> 27:28.009
My English is BAU BAU!

27:29.150 --> 27:30.470
A bit rough.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.731
A bit rough, yeah.

27:32.552 --> 27:33.713
Well, I think you know.

27:34.721 --> 27:43.626
Coco, you know, even though you woke up Coco while having too much fun during the splash party, I think, you know, you don't really mind.

27:43.726 --> 27:46.928
Go on a nice early walk together, you know?

27:46.968 --> 27:49.149
She's just glad that you're having fun.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.470
That's the most important thing.

27:50.510 --> 27:56.293
But you know, there's probably the expectation that you're going to take her out bright and early for a walk though, you know?

27:56.313 --> 28:00.156
That's your duty as her loyal and loving family, right?

28:01.941 --> 28:02.262
Walks.

28:02.622 --> 28:02.962
Walks.

28:03.263 --> 28:04.744
No leash!

28:05.064 --> 28:06.645
Leash is probably a good idea, Moco-chan.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.167
For you, no leash.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.969
But for Coco, a leash probably sounds very good.

28:13.612 --> 28:16.034
BAU BAU!

28:16.935 --> 28:20.598
But today I went on a walk.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.260
We have... De-den!

28:26.589 --> 28:29.214
Such a nice walk on a foresty trail.

28:29.254 --> 28:30.737
And together with your dad!

28:33.543 --> 28:33.943
So nice.

28:33.983 --> 28:35.244
Right?

28:35.504 --> 28:36.445
Good memories.

28:36.765 --> 28:39.066
Nice time spent together.

28:39.086 --> 28:42.468
You know, we're glad you could spend that time together.

28:42.788 --> 28:49.672
And, you know, I feel like maybe that might not say it, but with you, it made me really happy, too.

28:50.433 --> 28:50.773
Yeah.

28:51.874 --> 28:55.616
And you had your first Ice Pumpkin Spice Latte of the Year, too.

28:55.656 --> 28:55.996
Special.

28:56.136 --> 28:57.577
Extra special.

29:00.794 --> 29:02.579
Do you like it better iced?

29:02.759 --> 29:03.842
Ruffians, yum!

29:03.883 --> 29:05.687
Because you can get it hot or cold.

29:09.871 --> 29:11.953
I feel like it looks pretty cold in the photo.

29:12.894 --> 29:16.796
But I guess if you're doing a forest trail, then it might get a bit hot, right?

29:16.816 --> 29:20.199
The heart's pumping together with that.

29:20.819 --> 29:22.781
Do you think we should try it?

29:23.281 --> 29:24.802
The ice pumpkin spice latte?

29:24.842 --> 29:25.743
Hot is better.

29:26.644 --> 29:27.044
Ice.

29:27.484 --> 29:28.085
Blended!

29:28.205 --> 29:30.086
Like hot and cold together.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.347
How does that work?

29:31.667 --> 29:32.168
Hot!

29:33.709 --> 29:34.750
Even in hot weather!

29:37.132 --> 29:39.635
Extra, extra, extra birds.

29:40.656 --> 29:42.879
And you saw some silly birds too.

29:43.419 --> 29:46.563
I don't know how to pronounce those birds, but they sound pretty silly.

29:48.285 --> 29:52.429
But I guess you know, before we know it, it's gonna be spooky season again.

29:54.747 --> 29:55.928
No spooky.

29:56.429 --> 30:01.154
Let's make sure to go on lots of walks before it gets kind of gross and weird out there.

30:01.554 --> 30:01.775
Okay.

30:01.895 --> 30:02.676
No wet dogs.

30:02.896 --> 30:03.777
No wet dogs.

30:03.837 --> 30:04.217
Not yet.

30:06.840 --> 30:07.580
Thank you!

30:07.620 --> 30:08.181
BAU BAU!

30:08.301 --> 30:09.381
BAU BAU!

30:09.842 --> 30:13.724
And today for our Question of the Day!

30:13.804 --> 30:14.625
What do we have?

30:14.645 --> 30:15.945
Ta-da!

30:17.366 --> 30:23.390
Does Mococo notice that she adds an A at the end of all her O and U ending words?

30:23.450 --> 30:23.930
BAUI?

30:24.230 --> 30:24.730
NOI?

30:25.331 --> 30:26.011
YUI?

30:26.251 --> 30:27.552
Do you do that?

30:27.612 --> 30:29.013
When did this start?

30:29.493 --> 30:32.515
How come Fuwawa doesn't do this if you're twins?

30:33.175 --> 30:33.976
Hey!

30:34.336 --> 30:35.477
Do I even do this?

30:37.047 --> 30:37.907
I don't think I do.

30:37.927 --> 30:39.308
Does Moco-chan do this?

30:39.328 --> 30:40.128
I do not know this.

30:40.608 --> 30:43.329
My BAU is totally normal, okay?

30:44.409 --> 30:46.730
No, you're just trying to make me self-conscious of it, huh?

30:46.790 --> 30:47.110
Right.

30:47.210 --> 30:53.732
Just because we're not exactly the same on everything doesn't mean that we're less twins, you know?

30:53.752 --> 30:56.173
You're not misunderstanding.

30:56.213 --> 30:58.873
We don't have to go over this in the misunderstanding corner, do we?

30:59.274 --> 30:59.954
That's a threat.

31:03.256 --> 31:05.658
You know, I see comments being like, oi!

31:05.938 --> 31:07.419
They are identical twins.

31:07.839 --> 31:09.360
Just use your eyes, you know?

31:10.401 --> 31:13.624
Fuwawa has bigger ears and different eye color.

31:13.864 --> 31:16.766
They can't be identical.

31:16.866 --> 31:17.687
What do you mean?

31:18.607 --> 31:21.750
Are you calling our Maba Puppy a liar then?

31:22.770 --> 31:24.412
On something so important?

31:25.072 --> 31:25.532
Hai!

31:25.993 --> 31:26.233
Hai!

31:26.893 --> 31:30.016
This is one of my favorite things I'm watching, you see.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.995
Thank you!

31:36.336 --> 31:37.277
Thank you!

31:37.357 --> 31:38.157
I'm happy!

31:38.598 --> 31:39.278
You're happy?

31:39.458 --> 31:40.259
Good ruffians.

31:40.299 --> 31:40.779
So nice.

31:40.799 --> 31:41.440
Yeah!

31:41.480 --> 31:43.901
Thank you!

31:44.382 --> 31:46.964
BAU BAU!

31:47.004 --> 31:48.625
Thank you!

31:49.405 --> 31:51.807
Moco-chan, you do something like that, huh?

31:52.087 --> 31:52.408
Huh?

31:53.148 --> 31:53.568
Okay, well.

31:53.708 --> 31:54.029
BAU BAU!

31:54.069 --> 31:54.909
BAU BAU!

31:59.881 --> 32:03.562
Moco-chan, you feel pretty, uh, fired up today?

32:04.423 --> 32:04.803
Am I?

32:05.203 --> 32:05.403
Maybe?

32:05.423 --> 32:10.024
It seems like you are pretty, uh... Well, Ruffians, don't forget!

32:10.425 --> 32:15.446
We're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day.

32:15.686 --> 32:18.107
We want to hear more about your rocks and of course, questions!

32:18.527 --> 32:18.987
Questions!

32:19.167 --> 32:20.148
Ask me questions!

32:20.188 --> 32:21.488
Rocks, not your rocks.

32:21.728 --> 32:22.588
No, no pebbles.

32:25.509 --> 32:27.190
Send your Pebbles to Biboo, okay?

32:27.310 --> 32:28.891
That's the Biboo.

32:28.951 --> 32:29.911
That's the hashtag Pebble.

32:29.931 --> 32:33.312
We're hashtag FWMCMorning.

32:33.412 --> 32:35.113
It's a bit different.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.894
BAU BAU!

32:36.914 --> 32:40.435
We'll be waiting for your submissions!

32:40.515 --> 32:44.996
I've talked about a couple important things today, but I have something else.

32:45.357 --> 32:48.178
Something really important I want to tell you, okay?

32:54.531 --> 32:56.232
So, this.

32:57.533 --> 33:01.235
This here is a Mococo pep talk, okay?

33:01.795 --> 33:04.317
You're gonna hear it straight from me!

33:05.557 --> 33:07.018
Now, you!

33:07.779 --> 33:08.599
Ruffians!

33:09.419 --> 33:11.461
You've made it to the middle of the week!

33:12.041 --> 33:13.342
Congratulations!

33:14.770 --> 33:15.111
Ruffians!

33:15.672 --> 33:17.194
You're doing amazing.

33:17.635 --> 33:18.436
You're doing it!

33:19.538 --> 33:21.903
And you need to give yourself credit for that, okay?

33:22.564 --> 33:27.052
You know, you woke up today to watch FUWAMOCO Morning and you know what?

33:28.101 --> 33:31.902
After this, you're gonna make today amazing!

33:32.883 --> 33:33.723
I know you can do it.

33:34.543 --> 33:37.444
We all have days where we feel, you know, a bit off.

33:37.864 --> 33:42.926
But we just need to remind ourselves to take things in stride and keep on at it, okay?

33:43.666 --> 33:46.307
It's gonna be okay, because I believe in you.

33:49.008 --> 33:49.828
You can do it!

33:50.008 --> 33:50.928
I know you can!

33:51.388 --> 33:53.689
Ganbatte-nya!

33:54.649 --> 33:55.230
You awake now?

33:56.330 --> 33:56.430
Huh?

34:02.446 --> 34:04.847
That was amazing, Moco-chan!

34:05.708 --> 34:06.948
BAU BAU!

34:07.648 --> 34:09.109
BAU BAU!

34:09.129 --> 34:09.849
Awake now!

34:09.949 --> 34:13.131
You can do it, Ruffians!

34:13.151 --> 34:14.531
You can do it!

34:14.591 --> 34:15.312
Our next stream!

34:15.372 --> 34:16.612
Our next stream!

34:16.632 --> 34:19.494
We have an Extra Special.

34:20.454 --> 34:25.856
It's our one month celebration with you!

34:25.977 --> 34:29.138
I can't believe it's already been a month since we debuted.

34:29.498 --> 34:31.139
Ruffians, does it feel like that?

34:31.759 --> 34:33.040
It doesn't feel like that.

34:33.160 --> 34:35.581
Where did time go?

34:35.601 --> 34:36.821
We blinked and now we're here.

34:36.901 --> 34:37.301
It's here.

34:37.321 --> 34:37.301
101.

34:37.341 --> 34:46.925
But we actually have something very important that we'd like to share with you tonight.

34:47.425 --> 34:49.186
We really hope you'll join us, okay? 101!

34:51.912 --> 34:55.533
I know, you know, it's maybe a bit rough, maybe.

34:55.673 --> 34:56.974
Ruffians are like, ah, it's rough.

34:57.294 --> 34:59.674
Because we did so many celebrations recently.

34:59.694 --> 35:01.975
I have to spend too much time with FUWAMOCO.

35:03.976 --> 35:07.697
But you know, for us, one month really means a lot to us.

35:07.877 --> 35:08.257
It does.

35:08.957 --> 35:11.098
We really hope that you'll be there.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.819
We're really excited to share what we have to share with you today!

35:15.219 --> 35:20.901
And, you know, we're gonna talk about a bunch of our feelings, you know, from before we debuted, since then.

35:20.921 --> 35:26.503
You know, we'll review some of our favorite moments from the past month and maybe talk about a future too!

35:27.935 --> 35:30.816
We hope that we'll see you there!

35:31.136 --> 35:32.757
BAU BAU!

35:33.617 --> 35:37.919
And for what else is coming up, we have our schedule!

35:38.919 --> 35:44.761
This upcoming weekend we're gonna be playing It Takes Two for the first time!

35:44.781 --> 35:46.562
We did take a bit of a peek at it.

35:48.323 --> 35:51.365
It seems like it's gonna be pretty chaotic.

35:52.346 --> 35:53.507
I guess that makes sense.

35:53.707 --> 35:55.548
If it takes two of us, it's sort of chaotic.

35:55.689 --> 35:58.371
We can be pretty mischievous sometimes too.

36:00.713 --> 36:03.836
I think ruffians know that the best.

36:05.277 --> 36:09.580
It's gonna be interesting.

36:09.680 --> 36:14.424
On Sunday, we'll also be doing a very long super chat.

36:14.724 --> 36:19.908
It started early so that it can end late.

36:20.969 --> 36:22.971
It's gonna take however long it takes.

36:23.211 --> 36:24.272
We're gonna get it done.

36:25.199 --> 36:32.974
We're really really thankful and want to make sure that we can properly express our feelings to you and say thank you for all your support.

36:34.983 --> 36:35.944
It means a lot to us.

36:36.004 --> 36:36.884
It's been a long time.

36:36.924 --> 36:38.685
You've been waiting a long time.

36:39.066 --> 36:43.308
So, you know, let's have a lot of fun chit-chatting, being silly.

36:44.089 --> 36:47.811
Oh well, you know, we're finally able to properly say thank you.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.193
We hope you'll join us!

36:50.333 --> 36:55.196
I'm not sure how long it's gonna be, but you know, one stream, the maximum is 12 hours.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.103
We'll see!

36:59.123 --> 37:02.766
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

37:02.806 --> 37:05.628
Thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:06.189 --> 37:12.474
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

37:13.134 --> 37:13.635

37:39.531 --> 37:42.053
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:42.073 --> 37:43.934
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

37:44.334 --> 37:45.555

37:45.655 --> 37:48.056
