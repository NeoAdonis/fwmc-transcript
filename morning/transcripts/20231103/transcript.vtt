05:07.765 --> 05:10.306
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:10.846 --> 05:14.608
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.628 --> 05:18.589
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.669 --> 05:20.730
BAU BAU!

05:21.290 --> 05:24.151
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.571 --> 05:28.573
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm... Fuwa.

05:31.299 --> 05:33.060
I'm Fuwawa!

05:34.640 --> 05:37.061
I'm Mococo!

05:37.841 --> 05:40.762
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:40.842 --> 05:42.562
BAU BAU!

05:43.002 --> 05:47.443
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:48.544 --> 05:53.005
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 39th episode!

05:53.045 --> 05:54.525
That means...

05:57.766 --> 05:58.066
Almost 40.

05:58.606 --> 06:01.608
Almost 40 episodes already, Ruffians!

06:02.228 --> 06:03.348
I don't know how this happened.

06:04.029 --> 06:04.949
It's very strange.

06:06.189 --> 06:18.434
Well, I can see maybe a few Ruffians who might be joining us for the first time today, but FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:18.454 --> 06:18.514
A.k.a.

06:19.414 --> 06:20.935
FUWAMOCO!

06:22.176 --> 06:23.156
And it's hosted by us!

06:23.756 --> 06:25.177
FUWAMOCO!

06:25.197 --> 06:30.901
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:31.322 --> 06:38.507
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:38.967 --> 06:43.110
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:43.610 --> 06:45.732
BAU BAU!

06:45.872 --> 06:45.992
Huh?

06:47.765 --> 06:48.505
Lots of bouncing.

06:51.306 --> 06:54.447
Bouncing in the morning.

06:54.507 --> 06:56.308
BAU BAU!

06:57.088 --> 06:58.028
Wow.

06:59.989 --> 07:00.389
Moco-chan.

07:01.189 --> 07:01.689
Guess what?

07:01.849 --> 07:02.449
It's a new month.

07:03.230 --> 07:03.710
I don't know.

07:03.750 --> 07:08.151
Pero maybe is going somewhere warm?

07:08.191 --> 07:09.932
Let's see another Ruffian's eyes.

07:09.992 --> 07:14.773
Today's Pero Sighting is... De-den.

07:15.873 --> 07:17.034
Is it warm?

07:18.052 --> 07:18.733
Desert!

07:18.753 --> 07:21.174
Oh my goodness, the desert!

07:21.414 --> 07:21.775
Is it?

07:21.795 --> 07:23.236
Wait, is it that warm though?

07:23.356 --> 07:25.697
You went for a walk in the desert and saw Pero there?

07:27.817 --> 07:29.118
No, forget Pero!

07:29.839 --> 07:30.399
A desert.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.561
It must have been sort of hot and scary.

07:32.601 --> 07:34.203
Although it looks sort of, sort of hot.

07:34.243 --> 07:36.485
It looks cloudy, maybe it wasn't that hot.

07:36.685 --> 07:37.546
Definitely scary.

07:37.626 --> 07:38.807
I don't know.

07:39.107 --> 07:43.271
There aren't any deserts in the Northwest Passage, so it's pretty different.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.714
It sort of looks like a movie set, right?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.695
And a camel?

07:48.755 --> 07:49.496
What?

07:50.297 --> 07:51.017
A camel?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.040
Camels are scary.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.082
Why did you go to the desert though?

07:58.942 --> 08:14.609
I guess it's a question we could ask Pero too, but... Well, I think if I was to go to the desert, maybe I would want to go eat the rare cactuses.

08:15.350 --> 08:16.710
Are you sure, Moco-chan?

08:17.090 --> 08:19.491
Yeah, they have like water and juice in them, right?

08:19.811 --> 08:20.592
Cactus juice.

08:21.383 --> 08:26.366
Yeah, I guess, but you need to eat around the spikes too, right?

08:26.986 --> 08:35.311
Well, maybe that's not something for me or the ruffians that we could do, but maybe Pero could.

08:36.411 --> 08:37.291
Probably.

08:38.372 --> 08:47.036
But, you know, he might look a bit silly afterwards, like a big pinkish... I guess I can see him doing it too, yeah.

08:47.917 --> 08:51.038
He does look a little bit hydrated here, though.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.199
He looks hydrated?

08:52.379 --> 08:53.659
Dehydrated, dehydrated.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.440
He's not looking great.

08:56.181 --> 08:59.002
No, if he was looking hydrated, he'd look a little bit more blue.

08:59.182 --> 08:59.422
BAU BAU!

09:18.069 --> 09:18.969
And Ruffians!

09:19.690 --> 09:22.852
In case you didn't know... Tomorrow!

09:23.412 --> 09:29.597
Tomorrow is the big day of the hololive Minecraft Sports Festival!

09:29.617 --> 09:33.940
This is our first time ever participating in something like this.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.723
We're really excited to be a part of the red team!

09:38.823 --> 09:40.725
And all of Abbot will be participating too.

09:41.525 --> 09:44.287
Adventrix are in luck as well.

09:44.307 --> 09:48.549
But for our team, it's just us and Biboo participating.

09:48.569 --> 09:51.131
The advent on the red team.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.973
We'll be participating in the Four Seasons Relay.

09:55.914 --> 09:59.776
One game called Escort the Princess, and also Shoulder Voice.

09:59.936 --> 10:02.138
I guess Shoulder Voice, the relay is a relay, right?

10:02.158 --> 10:09.182
But Shoulder Voice is a game where we become Calli-senpai's horse, and she has to kill the other team members.

10:10.482 --> 10:11.983
We don't have to do the killing, that's nice.

10:12.123 --> 10:13.023
We just do the walking.

10:13.103 --> 10:13.703
We're the legs.

10:14.023 --> 10:19.544
We'll do our best, not as Demon Guard Dogs this time, but as Guard Horses.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.625
How does a horse BAU BAU?

10:21.645 --> 10:22.665
Is that a horse?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.566
Is that the sound a horse makes?

10:24.586 --> 10:27.066
I guess.

10:36.296 --> 10:45.729
But we are also suddenly added to participate in this year's longest and most intense game, the Escort the Princess.

10:46.029 --> 10:50.876
Regulus' Kanade was going to be one of the knights to protect Towa-senpai for our Red Team.

10:51.537 --> 10:55.580
But Kanade's internet was lagging, so we were added instead.

10:55.660 --> 10:59.023
Yeah, just sudden change, but I'm nervous!

10:59.083 --> 11:00.223
Ruffians!

11:00.664 --> 11:04.367
We'll be protecting Towa-senpai together with Shion-senpai and Ao!

11:06.568 --> 11:10.631
Yeah, hopefully we'll be a good night, but... We'll do our best to be a good night.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.892
I mean, guiding.

11:12.112 --> 11:12.592
Yeah.

11:12.652 --> 11:14.113
We should be good at that, right?

11:14.434 --> 11:27.082
Well, there's a bunch of different segments involved in this one game, so we're nervous, but we're going to make sure that we practice and do our absolute best for Kanade-M so that the red team can win, too.

11:27.423 --> 11:31.986
We know that Kanade was probably really looking forward to it, so it's too bad.

11:33.194 --> 11:35.460
We'll do our best so that there's no regrets.

11:35.581 --> 11:37.606
For both us and for Kaname.

11:39.730 --> 11:44.993
I know maybe some Ruffians who joined us may be a little concerned that FUWAMOCO's a little bit quiet.

11:45.013 --> 11:46.794
Because we just had a practice just before.

11:46.814 --> 11:48.315
The pre-party.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.236
Yeah, there was a lot of things going on.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.497
A lot of senpai.

11:51.777 --> 11:59.942
We're just trying to make sure to listen to Mikocchi-senpai, to Towa-senpai, so that we can get all the information and know what we're doing.

12:00.282 --> 12:04.465
And then be able to translate that to all the other members that maybe don't know Japanese.

12:04.985 --> 12:05.266
BAU BAU!

12:25.000 --> 12:25.300
BAU BAU!

12:45.018 --> 12:50.463
In case you didn't notice, there's also something to do with the sports festival.

12:50.623 --> 13:00.191
In celebration of the sports festival, we participated in a new voice pack, the Sports Day Voice Pack!

13:00.511 --> 13:07.497
This time we participated in English, but you can check them out over on the official hololive store.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.899
I guess there's also 1 Minute Samples on the webshop as well.

13:12.919 --> 13:14.440
I think it's a new addition, right?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.740
So you can take a listen to it as well!

13:17.080 --> 13:18.501
Same with all the voice packs too.

13:18.521 --> 13:21.161
You can check out the samples that are included now.

13:21.522 --> 13:23.562
But this is our first sports day ever!

13:23.942 --> 13:25.823
So we had to do our best to- Ever, ever.

13:25.963 --> 13:26.543
Ever, ever.

13:26.563 --> 13:30.544
So we did our best to remember all the sports days we've seen in anime while we recorded it.

13:31.024 --> 13:31.564
Yeah.

13:31.824 --> 13:32.505
Did you like them?

13:34.065 --> 13:34.806
Our voice packs.

13:34.946 --> 13:36.127
We hope you liked them!

13:36.187 --> 13:37.608
Why?

13:38.188 --> 13:42.471
You know, it was a little bit tricky because we don't have much sports day experience.

13:42.551 --> 13:43.632
No, I wonder why.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.793
You liked them!

13:45.834 --> 13:46.194
Why?

13:46.214 --> 13:47.595
Sporty FUWAMOCO.

13:47.615 --> 13:50.277
Why sporty?

13:50.297 --> 13:53.899
We kind of saw a bit of your reactions on Twitter.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.926
Seems like you really liked it.

13:58.306 --> 13:59.646
The reaction was large.

13:59.986 --> 14:04.188
Yeah, from the Ruffians that got their paws on it, I was seeing a lot of things.

14:05.128 --> 14:07.289
We're really happy that you enjoyed it.

14:07.729 --> 14:12.210
But the reaction is so large, we're kind of surprised.

14:13.530 --> 14:15.591
You really just enjoy Sports Day a lot.

14:15.611 --> 14:16.091
Maybe.

14:16.131 --> 14:16.451
Maybe.

14:19.972 --> 14:21.592
I don't know, we're really glad though!

14:21.612 --> 14:22.953
We're really happy you liked them!

14:23.013 --> 14:23.913
We're just surprised.

14:26.553 --> 14:31.734
If you enjoyed this one though, we hope that you'll continue to check out our future voice packs too!

14:31.754 --> 14:34.475
Yeah, we really enjoyed them so we hope that you will too.

14:34.655 --> 14:36.015
BAU BAU!

14:36.095 --> 14:38.936
Mococo Chieri!

14:40.816 --> 14:43.117
Can you give us a bit of a sample of your Chieri?

14:45.037 --> 14:45.497
Toss.

14:45.537 --> 14:46.118
Toss!

14:46.778 --> 14:48.160
Toss it like a boss!

14:48.180 --> 14:50.862
Toss it like a boss!

14:51.002 --> 14:52.103
Was that it?

14:52.143 --> 14:55.386
Moco-chan, maybe you need to practice more if you can't remember it anymore.

14:55.406 --> 15:01.711
A bit different.

15:01.831 --> 15:02.632
A bit different.

15:02.772 --> 15:03.612
A bit different.

15:04.293 --> 15:09.037
BAU BAU!

15:10.278 --> 15:13.781
I was really hoping that maybe today we could continue

15:14.577 --> 15:15.677
I streaked for once.

15:16.618 --> 15:18.218
Are you saying that I ruined it?

15:18.718 --> 15:18.979
Yeah.

15:20.139 --> 15:21.219
I ruined it!

15:21.239 --> 15:25.801
There's been another misunderstanding, Ruffians.

15:25.861 --> 15:28.002
I'm sure you realize what it is.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.122
Was.

15:29.882 --> 15:31.323
Was and is.

15:33.924 --> 15:35.164
So, Ruffians.

15:36.705 --> 15:39.106
Yesterday there was a misunderstanding.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.767
And I thought I squashed it right there and then.

15:43.936 --> 15:48.605
But, obviously, some of you didn't understand.

15:50.829 --> 15:51.370
Solid!

15:52.151 --> 15:54.736
I'll make it so you understand again, okay?

15:56.135 --> 16:10.800
Yesterday, after my one day, we were asking, you know, if we should read the Super Chats now, or if we should try to get a bit of sleep before the Minecraft Sports Day pre-party that we just had, you know.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.441
Yeah, because we were kind of planning to not get any sleep.

16:13.581 --> 16:13.901
Yeah.

16:13.941 --> 16:14.362
Yeah.

16:14.962 --> 16:15.202
But...

16:16.877 --> 16:20.440
So, I asked in just a simple poll.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.522
And it was just easy.

16:22.562 --> 16:23.643
We were talking about it.

16:23.723 --> 16:28.367
So, considering the context of what we were discussing, if you had used your brain, it should have been okay!

16:29.689 --> 16:32.791
What I asked was, Super Chat when?

16:33.832 --> 16:41.199
And the answers were, now, or, after Donkey Kong Country, slash, a separate stream.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.261
Those were the options.

16:44.437 --> 16:50.618
And you know regularly, from the context... From that context!

16:51.158 --> 16:54.279
You should think, read Super Chats when.

16:54.919 --> 16:57.399
Not, give Super Chats when.

16:58.979 --> 16:59.440
Okay?

16:59.960 --> 17:03.740
I'm not asking for a time for you to Super Chat.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.641
That's for you to decide if and when you would like to.

17:08.781 --> 17:10.401
Not for us, okay?

17:10.421 --> 17:11.262
So, bye now.

17:14.991 --> 17:18.553
You know Ruffians, that we're always super thankful.

17:19.613 --> 17:23.175
And that's why we want to take our time to be able to read them.

17:23.335 --> 17:30.499
But it's very difficult when we accidentally make our schedule crazy like this.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.740
It was an accident.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.581
It was an accident.

17:35.581 --> 17:36.481
To be honest!

17:39.467 --> 17:46.372
We also have some very important recordings and meetings that we're trying to fit in between these next two days before the Rocket Room Party!

17:46.933 --> 17:48.514
As well as do all the prep for that!

17:50.515 --> 17:53.418
We're lucky if we get a few hours of sleep at this point.

17:54.839 --> 17:56.980
It's a bit rough, Ruffian!

17:57.641 --> 17:59.983
Just a bit rough!

18:00.023 --> 18:01.264
You reap what you sow.

18:01.284 --> 18:01.364
Yeah.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.566
We did it to ourselves.

18:06.477 --> 18:10.943
We're gonna do our best to make every moment count right now, okay?

18:11.363 --> 18:12.244
But you decided.

18:12.264 --> 18:15.749
Super chat reading after Donkey Kong crazy, okay?

18:15.769 --> 18:17.591
But we are gonna do super chat reading.

18:17.611 --> 18:18.212
Ruffians!

18:18.872 --> 18:19.213
What?

18:19.293 --> 18:20.094
What are you doing?

18:20.114 --> 18:21.055
Ruffians!

18:21.215 --> 18:22.717
Why are you stopping, Shiori?

18:23.678 --> 18:24.579
Ruffians!

18:26.135 --> 18:28.056
You make more misunderstandings.

18:29.157 --> 18:32.919
You make more misunderstandings for me!

18:33.119 --> 18:34.560
You understand, right?

18:34.840 --> 18:36.561
You understand, right, Ruffians?

18:36.581 --> 18:39.182
Because I'm concerned that you don't understand yet.

18:39.762 --> 18:44.505
We're reading Super Chats after the Rocket Roof Party and after Donkey Kong Country.

18:44.545 --> 18:47.366
I don't know if it'll be Donkey Kong Country or Super Stream, but we'll see.

18:48.026 --> 18:48.947
Alright!

18:49.007 --> 18:49.547
Okay!

18:49.567 --> 18:50.688
Go for it!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.941
Ruffians!

18:55.782 --> 18:58.065
We're not demanding!

18:58.946 --> 19:03.511
Not demanding!

19:04.753 --> 19:06.495
Ruffians!

19:06.875 --> 19:10.520
Ruffians, you're gonna make Moco-chan cry.

19:11.961 --> 19:12.681
Huh?

19:12.741 --> 19:15.022
No misunderstandings, okay?

19:15.042 --> 19:18.724
She's just gonna continue making this annoying voice.

19:18.804 --> 19:23.085
No misunderstandings, okay?

19:23.825 --> 19:27.747
Don't do it to me like that, okay?

19:28.307 --> 19:28.847
Morning!

19:29.127 --> 19:30.328
You understand, right?

19:30.348 --> 19:31.808
You're just being silly now.

19:32.709 --> 19:33.269
Stop it.

19:34.729 --> 19:35.390
Stop it?

19:35.490 --> 19:36.130
Stop it!

19:37.824 --> 19:40.626
Now you wanted a story, huh?

19:40.646 --> 19:43.868
You wanted a story, huh?

20:09.024 --> 20:10.605
Ruffians!

20:11.585 --> 20:20.247
You know there was a bit of a story that we were telling back during our collab, our Family Feud collab with our IA-senpai.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.368
You wanted to hear more about it, but you forgot.

20:24.468 --> 20:27.769
You were a little bit shocked, I think.

20:29.369 --> 20:29.889
Just a bit.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.530
You still don't know, right?

20:34.950 --> 20:36.971
Did you want to maybe know the full story?

20:38.902 --> 20:41.684
There's really not much to it, but it's happy.

20:42.225 --> 20:44.166
Sweater.

20:44.307 --> 20:45.608
Very scary.

20:45.628 --> 20:50.332
It's an easy story.

20:50.352 --> 20:58.859
One day, you know, in the Northwest Passage, we are just kind of walking around the town squid, having a good afternoon.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.401
This is 100% a true story, okay?

21:02.841 --> 21:03.481
Percent.

21:03.561 --> 21:04.002
Percent.

21:04.102 --> 21:04.522
Okay.

21:04.962 --> 21:07.584
Moco-chan, you typo in your speech.

21:07.624 --> 21:08.904
Don't say that!

21:09.565 --> 21:11.345
What am I saying wrong?

21:11.546 --> 21:12.046
Percent.

21:12.346 --> 21:12.886
Percent.

21:13.026 --> 21:13.587
Percent.

21:14.147 --> 21:14.347
Huh?

21:14.567 --> 21:15.428
You said percent.

21:16.168 --> 21:17.109
A hundred percent.

21:18.149 --> 21:19.150
Isn't that how you say it?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.670
No, it's hundred percent.

21:21.371 --> 21:23.092
Percent, not present.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.346
100%!

21:24.524 --> 21:27.346
That's how I've always said it!

21:27.366 --> 21:27.346
100%!

21:28.347 --> 21:31.028
Anyways!

21:31.168 --> 21:31.589
Anyways!

21:31.749 --> 21:42.816
It was a nice afternoon, and then suddenly, from right in front of us and out of nowhere, a grizzly bear started running towards us like a bullseye.

21:43.056 --> 21:49.120
And you know, it's our amazing survival instincts.

21:50.776 --> 21:51.416
You know what we did?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.658
Biboo just stopped.

21:54.058 --> 21:54.398
Stopped?

21:54.818 --> 21:55.159
Yeah.

21:55.679 --> 21:57.840
And then the bear just ran right past us.

21:59.281 --> 22:05.885
You know, at the moment we didn't really think too much of it, but when we saw him running at us, we just thought, wow!

22:05.965 --> 22:08.166
He's so close and big and fluffy!

22:08.186 --> 22:12.509
If we just outstretched our hands, we could pet him, right?

22:12.589 --> 22:15.150
That's a good fluffy density.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.251
Yeah, it was cute.

22:16.551 --> 22:18.032
Yeah, it was really cute.

22:18.453 --> 22:24.638
And then, shortly after, we could hear some Demon Police dogs like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

22:24.998 --> 22:28.541
And running right after the bear saying that, Get out of the way!

22:28.621 --> 22:29.461
It's dangerous!

22:29.582 --> 22:32.644
It's dangerous and that's kind of when we realized, Oh!

22:32.664 --> 22:34.746
I guess that was dangerous.

22:34.806 --> 22:36.147
I guess that wasn't good, huh?

22:36.207 --> 22:38.349
That could have been our end just there.

22:39.269 --> 22:42.512
Yeah, just another day in Northwood Passage, okay?

22:43.653 --> 22:44.894
Remember, Ruffians,

22:45.427 --> 22:48.128
Don't feed the wildlife, no matter how cute.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.470
He was probably lost because he was eating food.

22:51.510 --> 22:54.872
But we aren't wildlife though, so it's okay to feed us.

22:54.932 --> 22:55.452
Yeah!

22:55.972 --> 22:57.173
Got it!

22:57.213 --> 23:00.054
We were just interested in his fur.

23:00.334 --> 23:00.714
Yeah.

23:00.814 --> 23:01.555
He looked fluffy.

23:01.615 --> 23:02.735
Fun to ride, you know?

23:02.835 --> 23:03.556
Fun to ride!

23:03.616 --> 23:04.936
I was just gonna say that.

23:05.116 --> 23:05.657
Right!

23:05.977 --> 23:09.879
It was a simple story, nothing big.

23:10.079 --> 23:12.220
Just a big, very scary bear.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.461
BAU BAU!

23:15.788 --> 23:19.633
Ruffians!

23:22.216 --> 23:23.217
I had a dream!

23:23.237 --> 23:26.862
And I remembered it too!

23:28.023 --> 23:28.764
Are you ready?

23:30.186 --> 23:31.307
You better be ready!

23:32.609 --> 23:35.952
It's my first dream, so... I'm gonna tell you it!

23:35.972 --> 23:40.977
My first dream that I can share with the Ruffians.

23:41.418 --> 23:48.405
It started with me noticing a big, big, black, fluffy spider on the wall.

23:48.705 --> 23:51.128
It was kind of like a faraway wall, distant wall.

23:52.276 --> 23:54.218
And it was like, it was okay.

23:54.298 --> 24:00.182
I felt kind of like, oh, I sure hope that he's not gonna come over here.

24:00.202 --> 24:05.065
And of course, you know, as soon as you hope that, it starts moving really fast.

24:05.646 --> 24:09.589
And I climbed down from the wall and started doing backflips while moving closer and closer.

24:09.609 --> 24:09.989
And like, rolling.

24:10.009 --> 24:10.069
How?

24:10.089 --> 24:10.229
Rolling?

24:10.249 --> 24:10.389
Rolling?

24:10.409 --> 24:10.649
Not rolling.

24:10.670 --> 24:19.616
It was like, BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

24:20.569 --> 24:20.789
Yeah.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.570
Just like any old spider.

24:23.071 --> 24:23.591
Okay.

24:24.292 --> 24:24.572
Fine.

24:25.552 --> 24:28.374
Yeah, but I was doing it while getting closer and closer.

24:28.394 --> 24:33.698
And then Moco-chan, you know Moco-chan, you were sitting down at a table and eating dinner or something.

24:33.718 --> 24:34.258
Okay.

24:34.659 --> 24:34.859
Yeah.

24:35.179 --> 24:36.680
And I was like, Moco-chan, watch out!

24:36.720 --> 24:38.181
There's a big spider!

24:38.621 --> 24:40.883
And you were just like, okay, it won't bother me.

24:40.903 --> 24:41.964
I'm just gonna sit here.

24:42.044 --> 24:42.564
It's fine.

24:42.824 --> 24:43.925
That's not like me at all.

24:44.385 --> 24:44.465
And...

24:46.046 --> 24:52.130
You just sat there, and it continued to dance around randomly and flip around.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.412
I was like, oh no, this isn't gonna go well.

24:56.873 --> 25:02.936
And of course, right after, it then flips onto the table and jumps onto Moco-chan's shoulder.

25:02.957 --> 25:05.178
And of course, you just kind of freeze.

25:06.937 --> 25:09.941
And so I just left there like, oh my goodness.

25:10.462 --> 25:12.605
And Moco-chan, you're like, what the heck?

25:13.326 --> 25:18.693
And then I just watched it slowly climb down your shoulder and back.

25:19.622 --> 25:21.643
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

25:21.703 --> 25:22.743
And Ruffians!

25:23.724 --> 25:26.945
You know how Moco-chan's jacket is kind of short, right?

25:27.045 --> 25:27.866
It's kind of short.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.927
And your shirt is even shorter, right?

25:30.687 --> 25:30.987
Yeah.

25:31.227 --> 25:40.792
So I had to watch as then the spider slowly, leg by fluffy leg, walked over Moco-chan's back.

25:40.912 --> 25:41.892
I got goosebumps.

25:42.192 --> 25:42.873
I got goosebumps.

25:43.093 --> 25:43.653
And then you know,

25:44.813 --> 25:46.394
Down onto the back of your shorts.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.235
You know, like you transition from your skin to the shorts.

25:49.295 --> 25:52.356
And like, you know how it's kind of like that area there?

25:52.376 --> 25:52.456
What?

25:53.317 --> 25:57.519
There's kind of like a bit of a gap between your back and the shorts.

25:57.739 --> 25:59.520
Are you saying it went into my shorts?

25:59.600 --> 26:01.180
No, but it was kind of close.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.542
Yeah, like the soft area.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.162
What?

26:05.182 --> 26:07.223
Yeah, it was really unsettling.

26:07.283 --> 26:09.044
Its legs were very hairy.

26:09.064 --> 26:11.025
Yeah, and then I woke up.

26:13.174 --> 26:14.035
I wonder what it means?

26:15.515 --> 26:16.196
Detailed!

26:16.556 --> 26:19.758
No, that's how Fuwawa's stories always go for her dreams.

26:19.838 --> 26:22.940
Her flags were so hairy, but it was really hard to watch.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.503
I could feel how itchy and gross it would be, like, being Moco-chan just sitting there, you know?

26:28.523 --> 26:29.483
What was I eating?

26:29.503 --> 26:30.664
It shouldn't be you!

26:30.684 --> 26:31.925
What was I eating?

26:31.945 --> 26:33.586
It should have been, maybe.

26:33.826 --> 26:34.266
What?

26:34.286 --> 26:34.986
What were you eating?

26:35.107 --> 26:35.547
I don't know!

26:36.367 --> 26:37.608
Listen to me.

26:37.648 --> 26:39.450
You might not have been eating anything.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.751
Oh, I'm just sitting at the table eating nothing.

26:41.771 --> 26:42.972
Maybe.

26:43.192 --> 26:43.893
I don't know.

26:43.913 --> 26:43.953
Hi.

26:45.614 --> 26:47.436
And that was my dream.

26:47.556 --> 26:48.897
Why was I sitting at a table?

26:48.917 --> 26:49.637
I don't know.

26:49.657 --> 26:50.758
You were just doing that.

26:50.978 --> 26:52.479
We don't even have a table.

26:52.499 --> 26:55.381
We don't even have a table.

26:56.822 --> 26:57.763
That was my dream.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.024
BAU BAU!

27:02.300 --> 27:06.381
Found something also kind of happy.

27:06.401 --> 27:11.763
We found something new that we really really like.

27:12.563 --> 27:13.423
It was sort of funny.

27:13.443 --> 27:19.245
The other day we decided to try a new tea out to do with Monseo.

27:22.786 --> 27:27.791
It's a special cinnamon orange tea, but it's super fancy.

27:27.851 --> 27:29.773
It was on sale, so it's okay.

27:30.113 --> 27:33.716
But when we opened it, we thought that it would be loose leaf tea.

27:33.836 --> 27:34.517
But no!

27:35.117 --> 27:38.520
It's just sort of packaged funny, but it's still in tea bags.

27:39.641 --> 27:43.485
But we have to store it in the freezer apparently.

27:43.885 --> 27:45.326
So we listen and we put it in the freezer.

27:45.546 --> 27:46.988
But it really smells so good.

27:52.676 --> 27:57.885
For some reason there's a really yummy cinnamon oil stuck to the inside of the packaging.

28:00.469 --> 28:01.190
Do you like it?

28:01.690 --> 28:06.555
It's like super strong and sweet, and it kind of feels like your tongue is on fire in a good way.

28:06.875 --> 28:09.737
Yeah, it's not spicy, it's just sort of like pitter-pattering.

28:09.797 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, I think I actually like it better than the tea.

28:13.060 --> 28:13.801
Oh, the oil?

28:13.961 --> 28:15.383
Yeah, it's really strong.

28:15.403 --> 28:19.066
Oh, but the tea is super yummy too, it makes us feel sort of fancy.

28:19.246 --> 28:21.108
Yeah, tea is wonderful.

28:21.636 --> 28:22.997
It has all these instructions.

28:23.037 --> 28:24.819
We're gonna drink this tea.

28:24.879 --> 28:25.180
Lots!

28:25.220 --> 28:26.301
That's what I think.

28:26.361 --> 28:27.142
Yeah, yeah!

28:27.202 --> 28:27.622
It's nice.

28:28.263 --> 28:29.004
Very warming.

28:29.384 --> 28:31.586
Maybe not so much Rat King tea?

28:31.646 --> 28:32.988
No, you can't Rat King this tea.

28:33.028 --> 28:33.648
No, you can't.

28:33.869 --> 28:34.589
There's no tails.

28:35.030 --> 28:35.250
No.

28:36.812 --> 28:39.975
It's very important to the Rat King tea to have tails, okay?

28:40.035 --> 28:40.295
Yeah.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.918
BAU BAU!

28:45.740 --> 28:49.621
Wow, let's head over to our regular corner again.

28:49.641 --> 28:54.003
Our Doggie of the Day, we have... De-den!

28:54.423 --> 28:55.603
It's Mookie!

28:55.683 --> 28:58.124
Mookie is the Doggie of the Day!

28:58.684 --> 28:59.944
I love Mookie's eyes.

29:00.444 --> 29:00.825
Sock.

29:01.905 --> 29:06.326
It's the same.

29:07.627 --> 29:09.607
Mookie is so cute!

29:16.863 --> 29:20.064
Same piece.

29:20.344 --> 29:26.966
Well, you know, we're really happy to have such a cute viewer supporting us and enjoying their breakfast.

29:27.046 --> 29:27.686
Right.

29:27.727 --> 29:28.507
FUWAMOCO Morning.

29:28.847 --> 29:32.868
You know, Mugi, looks like they might have been waking up a bit early this day, though, huh?

29:32.908 --> 29:33.488
Maybe.

29:34.069 --> 29:34.449
I get it.

29:34.469 --> 29:38.390
Are you gonna go back to bed once you get your breakfast?

29:39.690 --> 29:42.531
If you do, get a good rest, okay, Mugi?

29:42.731 --> 29:44.112
Rest those eyes.

29:44.372 --> 29:44.572
Yeah.

29:46.684 --> 29:48.164
How does Mugi BAU BAU?

29:48.225 --> 29:51.887
I feel like it's more like a... Maybe a tiny BAU BAU.

29:51.987 --> 29:54.268
A bit husky but quiet.

30:04.474 --> 30:07.875
Well, Mugi, Mugi is a character.

30:07.935 --> 30:13.458
I think Mugi's very happy to share breakfast together with you while enjoying FUWAMOCO Morning.

30:13.558 --> 30:14.838
It's always nice to share.

30:15.178 --> 30:17.639
What more can you really ask for though, you know?

30:18.040 --> 30:21.261
I think that is the sign of a true buddy.

30:22.601 --> 30:23.582
Good buddy.

30:24.262 --> 30:26.143
BAU BAU!

30:27.523 --> 30:31.285
And next we have... Today I went on a walk

30:32.113 --> 30:33.915
Why don't we go on a walk for this time?

30:34.215 --> 30:35.296
De-den!

30:37.018 --> 30:39.300
A nice foresty walk!

30:39.801 --> 30:40.982
It looks so quiet.

30:41.102 --> 30:41.983
It's just nice.

30:42.443 --> 30:43.665
Peaceful.

30:44.285 --> 30:49.330
You know we always do some very strong pondering sort of, what's the word?

30:50.071 --> 30:50.732
Reflecting!

30:51.312 --> 30:53.174
When we go on good walks like this.

30:53.234 --> 30:55.036
You're pondering, we're pondering.

30:55.476 --> 30:56.177
Both pondering.

30:57.918 --> 31:00.961
This sky is so nice and blue here too.

31:00.981 --> 31:04.443
The brown and the yellow and the green and the red.

31:04.463 --> 31:14.091
To think though, just a few weeks ago those trees were filled with leaves and now you know before you know it, there'll be snow covering all of them.

31:15.646 --> 31:17.848
The years passed by just so fast.

31:17.948 --> 31:19.150
So fast.

31:19.910 --> 31:23.394
But please, Ruffians, make sure you dress warmly so you don't catch a cold, okay?

31:23.414 --> 31:28.239
Yeah, especially when you go somewhere like a bit more forest area.

31:28.359 --> 31:30.161
One day you might go outside and be like, oh, it's warm!

31:30.481 --> 31:34.145
But the next day it might be very cold, so be careful, okay?

31:35.086 --> 31:36.707
BAU BAU!

31:38.048 --> 31:40.470
And our question of the day!

31:40.570 --> 31:41.410
Let's see!

31:41.871 --> 31:43.031
De-den!

31:43.792 --> 31:51.637
This may be a very silly question, but why is ear and tail touching a no-go if you don't even bat an eye to paw holding?

31:53.878 --> 31:56.760
Bat an eye to paw holding?

31:56.840 --> 32:01.783
What makes you think that we don't bat an eye to paw holding?

32:01.843 --> 32:02.123
Huh?

32:04.686 --> 32:11.752
You know, we're fine together because it's safer that way if something's scary or if we need to cross a busy road, so it's okay.

32:12.572 --> 32:17.116
But I don't think we've ever done anything to say otherwise.

32:19.158 --> 32:23.602
You know, paw holding should be with someone you love and care about.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.704
Like your family and friends.

32:27.526 --> 32:28.347
Simple answer.

32:43.641 --> 32:46.064
Simple answer.

32:46.444 --> 32:48.106
BAU BAU!

32:48.466 --> 32:51.569
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions.

32:51.589 --> 32:54.832
We're always looking for new questions.

32:54.912 --> 32:56.894
Doggie of the Day, you know.

32:57.355 --> 32:58.976
Pero Sightings, too.

32:58.996 --> 33:01.319
But for our next stream!

33:09.201 --> 33:20.289
It's time for us to do our best to communicate with each other and do our best also to disarm the bombs because we're playing keep talking and nobody explodes.

33:20.769 --> 33:21.650
I think we're real good.

33:21.830 --> 33:22.351
I don't know.

33:22.371 --> 33:23.592
I think Ruffians

33:24.372 --> 33:30.175
If you know a little bit about us, our communication skills can be a little interesting, right?

33:31.235 --> 33:34.076
We don't need to talk, it'll be okay.

33:34.176 --> 33:36.937
I don't know, I think... Exactly!

33:36.957 --> 33:40.919
Either we'll do really well, or really poorly.

33:41.779 --> 33:43.320
Which one do you think, Ruffians?

33:44.020 --> 33:45.181
Well or poor?

33:47.093 --> 33:49.435
Well, you'll have to be there to find out!

33:50.195 --> 33:52.437
BAU BAU!

33:52.457 --> 33:54.759
And our schedule!

33:55.339 --> 34:01.865
Well, after the hololive sports festival, we have our FWMC Rock n' Rawr Party!

34:02.105 --> 34:04.927
But this time the theme is hardcore!

34:05.067 --> 34:05.908
BAU BAU!

34:07.689 --> 34:15.378
We're going to be singing lots of songs that include lots of voice, and lots of rock, and a couple of BAU BAUs here and there too.

34:16.039 --> 34:19.563
It will probably include some BAU BAUs, you know how things are.

34:19.603 --> 34:22.907
We hope that your markers will be able to keep up with us, Ruffians.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.149
BAU BAU!

34:28.293 --> 34:33.396
Thank you so much for joining us today, Ruffians!

34:33.696 --> 34:37.278
We're gonna do our best next with practice for the sports festival.

34:38.839 --> 34:45.543
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

34:47.822 --> 34:49.082
Nanjiro Nagayon.

34:49.262 --> 34:50.683
BAU BAU!

34:50.743 --> 34:51.663
Mr. Lick.

34:51.903 --> 34:53.384
BAU BAU!

34:53.744 --> 34:54.764
Kitsuneko.

34:55.004 --> 34:56.325
BAU BAU!

34:56.345 --> 34:57.125
Gwen.

34:57.505 --> 34:58.925
BAU BAU!

34:59.085 --> 35:00.206
Ex-Human Boy.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.726
BAU BAU!

35:02.066 --> 35:03.507
Dreaming Noisagi.

35:03.707 --> 35:05.147
BAU BAU!

35:05.747 --> 35:06.488
Yellow.

35:06.828 --> 35:08.308
BAU BAU!

35:08.808 --> 35:09.949
Maid of the Soup.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.069
BAU BAU!

35:12.530 --> 35:23.514
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

35:23.954 --> 35:26.956
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:26.976 --> 35:29.016
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!
