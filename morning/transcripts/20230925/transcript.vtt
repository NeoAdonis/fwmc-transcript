00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.476
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:17.637
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:21.298
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.618
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:27.039
I'm a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.599
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.740
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.560
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.141
And today, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:40.662
Ruffians!

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:44.486
Thank you for joining us today for our 24th episode!

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:46.028
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:46.048 --> 00:05:48.291
A new day, Moco-chan.

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.553
A new day.

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:52.095
Do you think we're ready?

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:02.210
If not us, hopefully the Ruffians are.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.492
And if you're not, then we'll make you ready.

00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:12.260
Well, for any first time Ruffians, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show

00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:15.623
Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:17.184
AKA FUWAMOCO.

00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:21.306
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:26.950
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.074
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:38.877
Now let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:39.557
BAU BAU!

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:46.986
Moco-chan, has there been another Pero Sighting?

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:48.107
There has been!

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:54.054
Well, I wonder, did this Ruffian seem on Mars again still?

00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:55.035
Is she still on Mars?

00:06:56.116 --> 00:07:00.260
It seems that Pero's a...

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.831
Mama Pero.

00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:11.193
I don't know, this kind of looks like the nest a mama bird would have.

00:07:11.553 --> 00:07:13.854
Are those babies?

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:16.095
Four babies!

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:18.316
Oh my gosh.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:20.496
Pero were toyed.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:25.959
Actually though, if you kind of look at them...

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.159
Cute, right, Ruffians?

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:30.900
I guess they're kinda cute, right?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.860
They're all different, you know?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.281
They all have their own unique traits, you know?

00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:40.483
There's one with much bigger ears than the rest of them.

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.083
Just like me to you, Moco-chan, right?

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:43.744
There's one that's a bit rounder?

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.364
A bit smiley?

00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:47.024
No, it's not me!

00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:47.405
No.

00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:55.089
I don't know though, I don't think you should be taking any of them from the nest.

00:07:56.051 --> 00:08:03.802
If Pero's a chill mama and anything like we know Pero to be normally, then you might regret it.

00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:16.076
I still don't really know what I'm looking at, but is it one of those things where if you give your eyes a good rub and blink twice it just goes away like a dream?

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:18.839
Ruffians, let's give our eyes a good rub, okay?

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.459
Do wake up.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.644
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:25.826
It's gone.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.349
Thank goodness.

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:32.450
I guess it was a dream, huh?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.210
Just sleeping.

00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:35.771
Get to sleep all your life, you know?

00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:40.073
It doesn't really make sense for Pero to be a mama bear, you know?

00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:43.414
Pero is Pero, right?

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:47.616
It must have just been a particularly bad dream, right?

00:08:51.287 --> 00:08:51.907
Ruffians!

00:08:52.307 --> 00:08:54.848
Let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:59.010
But maybe not something as deceiving as this last one was.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:05.812
You can let us know with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.953
Thank you!

00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:10.854
BAU BAU!

00:09:11.094 --> 00:09:12.735
You couldn't see that, Ruffians.

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:15.236
You just want to rub your eyes, right?

00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:23.201
Well, on the topic of rubbing your eyes, we have a bit of sad news.

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:25.383
More personal sad news.

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:39.818
You know, in case you saw on Twitter last night, you might know, but... Unfortunately, we weren't really able to sleep last night.

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.636
It's the worst, you know?

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:44.117
It's such a waste of time.

00:09:44.137 --> 00:09:47.920
No matter what, we both just couldn't fall asleep.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:55.146
You know, you might think it's weird, like, well, if Moco-chan can't sleep, then Fuwawa should be able to sleep, but... Right, it's not like that.

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:56.106
I don't know why.

00:09:56.126 --> 00:10:02.531
You know, we both even took a nice bath after Planetarian Eats to get all toasty and comfy and ready for bed.

00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:04.573
You know...

00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:09.086
I even... I used my favorite bath salts for it.

00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:11.308
Just to make us extra sleepy.

00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:14.511
Moco-chan let me use them too.

00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:15.252
Right?

00:10:15.452 --> 00:10:17.594
But... It didn't work.

00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:19.036
No?

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:19.896
No!

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:31.880
You know, it's the worst when you can't sleep because there's so many things you'd rather do rather than just lie in bed and try to sleep.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.783
Like you have to do this and that and this, but you're trying to sleep, so...

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:46.299
We could be doing so many other things with our time, and we have lots of homework to do today, so there's not really any time to take a nap or anything.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.659
No time to sleep again.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.542
You know, it's times like that where I can't sleep in the middle of the night.

00:10:54.102 --> 00:11:03.846
I look at what's going on with the Ruffians, so... But I know that the Ruffians did have a lot of interesting suggestions on how to get to sleep.

00:11:04.006 --> 00:11:04.366
Right?

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:06.087
Right, Ruffians?

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:08.336
Like what?

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:11.282
Like some Ruffians suggested hot milk.

00:11:11.383 --> 00:11:12.826
Which I played it before, you know?

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.129
Hot milk to get to sleep.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:15.231
I don't know.

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:16.915
It just sounds...

00:11:18.064 --> 00:11:20.785
Not like something that would be very appetizing.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.326
It doesn't seem right enough.

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.807
It seems like it wouldn't calm me down.

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:27.268
Like, hot milk is good in tea.

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:33.551
But, I don't think otherwise is very... It just sounds like bleh.

00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:35.512
Yeah, I don't know.

00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:43.795
I guess I can kind of understand, but... Like, other things that the Ruffians suggested, though, is like... Getting McDonald's?

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:45.016
Is that real?

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:48.005
Milk sounds bad, yeah.

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:49.026
Yeah, I don't know.

00:11:49.046 --> 00:11:57.811
McDonald's, I feel like that just might make you feel a bit more awake, but I guess it could also be like a fun middle of the night adventure.

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:02.414
If you're a brave person, you can go outside, right?

00:12:02.494 --> 00:12:07.657
I do feel like it would be fun, but I think my tummy might keep me up after that.

00:12:07.717 --> 00:12:08.337
Is that a normal thing?

00:12:08.397 --> 00:12:08.998
Is it normal?

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.820
I don't know if it's normal.

00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:22.682
I don't think that's the best idea.

00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:25.343
I thought it was... It sounds interesting.

00:12:25.403 --> 00:12:30.365
It sounds fun, but... Yeah, I don't know if it's the most practical.

00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:31.766
Water is good, you know.

00:12:31.786 --> 00:12:35.927
If you have something like McDonald's and milk, you gotta brush your teeth again.

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:40.669
But there was also one other really good suggestion too, Moco-chan.

00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.343
A lullaby from a Ruffian.

00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:46.624
I like that one.

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:49.587
Lullaby for FUWAMOCO.

00:12:49.887 --> 00:12:51.248
It sounds cute.

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:55.912
I sort of want to tinkle that more when I can't fall asleep in the future.

00:12:55.932 --> 00:12:57.373
You know, when I'm trying to fall asleep.

00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:01.319
Thank you, love you for the good suggestions.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.223
Please be there for us when it's difficult sometimes, okay?

00:13:05.603 --> 00:13:08.145
BAU BAU!

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:09.887
BAU BAU!

00:13:09.907 --> 00:13:14.571
Even if we had a little bit of sad news, there's been some good news too!

00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:18.154
Koyori-senpai hit 1 million subscribers!

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:19.535
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:25.098
Congratulations, Koyori-senpai!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:33.142
The other day, our canine and precious senpai, Koyori-senpai, just reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube.

00:13:33.202 --> 00:13:36.344
Huge accomplishment.

00:13:36.384 --> 00:13:40.365
We all know that she's been working very hard to reach that goal.

00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:45.328
FUWAMOCO, we're so happy that the dream has come true for you too.

00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:53.353
I hope that, you know, maybe one day we can collab and maybe we can say BAU BAU WAO!

00:13:53.413 --> 00:13:54.574
BAU BAU WAO!

00:13:54.974 --> 00:13:59.017
Congrats, Kuri-senpai!

00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:02.359
This is truly a crazy stream of us.

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:07.863
Yeah, I don't think we'll ever be anything close to her, but we'll do our best in our own FUWAMOCO way.

00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:09.704
BAU BAU!

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:14.327
Kuri-senpai, omedetou!

00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:17.970
It's good to have happiness.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.312
Sad news with happiness.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:20.993
No more sad news.

00:14:21.614 --> 00:14:26.199
Unless there's been a... A bit of a misunderstanding.

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:27.040
Maybe.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:27.660
Maybe.

00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:31.004
Just a little maybe.

00:14:31.024 --> 00:14:31.104
Yeah.

00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:35.669
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.131
I don't know.

00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:40.732
Maybe it's small enough that the Ruffians didn't notice?

00:14:40.872 --> 00:14:41.693
I don't know, maybe.

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:50.438
We thought that we should maybe let you know, but over the weekend, it was Mumei-senpai's 3D showcase, right?

00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:52.699
No misunderstandings there, right?

00:14:52.999 --> 00:14:53.419
Happy!

00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:54.760
It's happy, you know?

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.763
Moco-chan, we should say another big congrats, right?

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:03.010
Congratulations!

00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:09.436
It was really really wonderful.

00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:14.721
We really liked the emotional final song that Iyami-senpai sang too.

00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:20.746
But during it, she had a song that she sang together with Poka-senpai, right?

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:25.211
Did it surprise you as much as it surprised us?

00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:33.880
You know, at the end of their performance together, Pouka-senpai went in for a sudden hug from Mumei-senpai, right?

00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:37.759
Right, right.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.403
And, uh, we're a bit surprised, right?

00:15:42.244 --> 00:15:45.747
And so, Moco-chan, you commented that hug.

00:15:46.548 --> 00:15:49.090
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:50.172
Dot?

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.293
With six dots!

00:15:51.393 --> 00:15:52.093
Yeah.

00:15:53.294 --> 00:16:03.962
Maybe, you know, maybe some Ruffians, some adventures maybe misunderstood that to be jealous or happy, but that definitely wasn't it, right?

00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:04.542
Misunderstanding.

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:05.263
Right, Moco-chan?

00:16:05.303 --> 00:16:06.684
It's a misunderstanding.

00:16:06.704 --> 00:16:08.985
It definitely, definitely wasn't that.

00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:11.827
You know, it was just because I was surprised and touched.

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:12.168
Yeah.

00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:13.268
Right, right, right.

00:16:13.308 --> 00:16:18.492
I was just happy for Mumei-senpai that she got a hug from Polka-oneechan.

00:16:18.532 --> 00:16:19.193
You know, yeah.

00:16:19.473 --> 00:16:20.574
Exactly that, right?

00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:20.994
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:23.816
Not because I didn't get a hug from Polka, onee-chan.

00:16:23.876 --> 00:16:24.336
No, I know.

00:16:24.836 --> 00:16:29.960
I know I can't remember one day I wasn't with you, but maybe I forgot to give you a hug.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.140
What?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.240
Yeah.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.181
Happy Bume-senpai Howl!

00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:36.124
Happy that Bume-senpai got a howl, I guess.

00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:42.629
Good 3D Showcase!

00:16:42.989 --> 00:16:48.374
Congratulations on the 3D Showcase, Mimei-senpai!

00:16:48.434 --> 00:16:49.815
What did Moco-chan just say?

00:16:50.236 --> 00:16:52.077
You heard me.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.520
BAU BAU!

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.664
Not a misunderstanding.

00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:01.627
Moco-chan's brain didn't break at all.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.008
No, right?

00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:03.949
No.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:05.410
Well...

00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:13.105
I have, maybe... You have something you have to say, right?

00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:14.165
I don't have to say this.

00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:16.405
It's embarrassing, Moco-chan.

00:17:17.706 --> 00:17:18.946
It's time for you to confess.

00:17:18.966 --> 00:17:22.266
I have a confession, Ruffians.

00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:25.127
It's embarrassing though.

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:29.268
I'm still a puppy, but not this much a puppy.

00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:36.589
Ruffians, you know, some days it's hard to control ourselves, right?

00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:37.544
BAU BAU.

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:57.251
When we go for a good walk, naturally we see other dogs on the walk.

00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:59.872
You know, just like any Ruffian.

00:18:00.693 --> 00:18:05.034
Sometimes they're cute, maybe a bit fluffy, maybe a bit fuzzy.

00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:13.038
But the other day, we crossed paths with one dog that was especially fluffy.

00:18:13.138 --> 00:18:14.118
And what did you do with it?

00:18:14.138 --> 00:18:17.540
Do I have to say, Moco-chan?

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.082
Fuwawa accidentally started BAU BAUing at it.

00:18:23.422 --> 00:18:24.803
I just couldn't help it!

00:18:25.143 --> 00:18:27.024
It was so cute, so fluffy!

00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:30.086
She went BAU BAUing!

00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:35.148
Ruffians, that happens to you sometimes too, right?

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:40.751
You know, you pass by a cute dog, you just get so excited that you can't stop yourself from BAU BAUing!

00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.732
Right?

00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:45.209
Yes!

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.910
Yes!

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.250
Yes!

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:46.671
Yes!

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.773
Let's do our best together.

00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:49.494
Understandable.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:50.214
No!

00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:50.895
No!

00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:51.376
No!

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:51.976
Don't!

00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:53.758
I think no is more reasonable.

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.300
No is more reasonable.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.181
I feel like a rose.

00:18:56.561 --> 00:18:59.804
Ruffians, you need to try to act cool here.

00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:03.128
You should say yes, you know?

00:19:05.505 --> 00:19:09.848
I guess it's lucky because Moco-chan stopped me before I lost myself.

00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:12.090
It's a good thing I'm here, right?

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.412
I guess it could have been pretty bad.

00:19:15.993 --> 00:19:17.754
I'm a good guide dog!

00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:23.159
I've trained a lot!

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.761
I guess I'm still just a puppy, right?

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:28.483
I'll do better next time.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:33.122
So don't let the BAU BAU wheel get to you, okay?

00:19:33.143 --> 00:19:36.404
Fuwawa and the Ruffians.

00:19:36.804 --> 00:19:38.605
Let's stay in control together, okay?

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:39.725
Stay in control.

00:19:40.165 --> 00:19:42.806
Alright, how did I react?

00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:45.707
No Fuwawa, no BAU BAU!

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:46.167
Like that.

00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:46.908
No BAU BAU!

00:19:46.928 --> 00:19:47.008
Yeah.

00:19:51.252 --> 00:19:53.996
It's hard when they're cute and fluffy.

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:59.523
And that's the end of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:02.627
What are you announcing?

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.349
It's the end!

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:04.409
No!

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.615
No, it's the start of a new week, right Ruffians?

00:20:10.658 --> 00:20:16.939
And the start of a new week means that we got to challenge ourselves to something new, right?

00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:18.119
Right.

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:21.580
Ruffians, you have a good idea of what you're gonna challenge, right?

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:36.303
And Moco-chan, I think Moco-chan does too because you know we're gonna start the week off with a bang and Moco-chan is going to be continuing to challenge herself to eat natto!

00:20:39.184 --> 00:20:40.524
Moco-chan, you're ready, right?

00:20:40.544 --> 00:20:46.027
You know, I haven't slept, so then my tummy is extra extra.

00:20:47.328 --> 00:20:50.609
And that's exactly why you need to have some natto then.

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:59.674
Ruffians, this is Moco-chan's third time trying to eat natto on FUWAMOCO Morning, but there still might be some Ruffians that don't really know what natto is.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:05.877
So to explain, it's a very common breakfast food in Japan that's made of fermented soybeans.

00:21:07.237 --> 00:21:15.667
And yeah, fermented soybeans can be rather sticky and slimy and maybe a bit strong smelling too.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.330
But it's really really healthy for you.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.873
I want to be able to eat it because it's healthy for you.

00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:30.741
I feel like right now is not the time to challenge myself.

00:21:31.882 --> 00:21:33.524
Right now I need headbutts.

00:21:33.764 --> 00:21:35.225
Not until you eat it.

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:35.725
But!

00:21:36.026 --> 00:21:36.206
But!

00:21:36.306 --> 00:21:36.506
But!

00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:37.026
So!

00:21:37.307 --> 00:21:42.471
Moco-chan is going to conquer her dislike for natto so that she can continue to protect

00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:45.232
You'll smile for many, many years to come.

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:46.052
Right, Moco-chan?

00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:47.292
I'll do my best.

00:21:47.652 --> 00:21:55.934
And in that way, you can become just like her older sister, Fuwawa, who eats it happily every day.

00:21:56.634 --> 00:21:57.934
Yeah.

00:21:58.114 --> 00:22:02.875
Actually, Ruffians, I thought that maybe today I'd let Moco-chan use soy sauce on it.

00:22:03.696 --> 00:22:04.996
But... no.

00:22:05.911 --> 00:22:06.111
No.

00:22:07.213 --> 00:22:10.116
We all know that I'm gonna have to eat it later today.

00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:15.563
And I don't want soy sauce on it, so... She's going to have to eat it straight.

00:22:16.624 --> 00:22:19.868
And today, last time on the... I did good last time.

00:22:19.888 --> 00:22:20.469
You ate one bean.

00:22:20.489 --> 00:22:20.910
I did good!

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.250
I did good!

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:25.556
I don't know.

00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:30.800
So today, Moco-chan's goal is... No way, Miki!

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.580
Go again!

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.601
Because it's healthy.

00:22:32.661 --> 00:22:33.842
I'm gonna stay on you.

00:22:33.962 --> 00:22:38.185
And I don't know why every time you choose the chopsticks that I hate the most.

00:22:38.686 --> 00:22:40.587
I don't like the texture of the chopsticks.

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:42.308
Okay, just... Moco-chan, shush.

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:43.489
Shush!

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:48.253
Can you hear it?

00:22:48.273 --> 00:22:48.713
Mix, mix, mix.

00:22:52.589 --> 00:22:56.091
Ah, it's nice and stood and over.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:59.113
Renato is happy to do it.

00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.074
Renato is ready for the week.

00:23:01.654 --> 00:23:06.857
Ready to go into Moco-chan's tummy.

00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:08.058
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:11.060
First, first, first, first, first.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.842
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard.

00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:16.062
You worked twice.

00:23:16.543 --> 00:23:19.004
I'm sorry, I don't like it as much as other people.

00:23:19.024 --> 00:23:20.265
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:24.946
I'm really... Let her use her favorite chopsticks.

00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:25.486
No!

00:23:25.846 --> 00:23:33.928
She needs to become a big... Moco-chan, what are you doing?

00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:36.649
Angry sounds.

00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:39.290
Are you making a lip-sucking sound?

00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:45.021
Wow, Moco-chan.

00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:46.802
I want you to clean off the chopsticks.

00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:47.762
I'm not gonna clean them off!

00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:50.103
Can I wipe them off with my tissue?

00:23:50.123 --> 00:23:50.703
No!

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:53.304
No, if you put it in your mouth, then it'll be... No.

00:23:53.324 --> 00:23:53.864
Wiped off then.

00:23:53.944 --> 00:23:55.464
No, I'm gonna use the tissue.

00:23:55.504 --> 00:23:56.704
No, Moco-chan.

00:23:56.884 --> 00:23:58.265
You're so weak.

00:23:58.785 --> 00:23:59.605
I'm weak right now.

00:23:59.685 --> 00:24:00.846
I didn't sleep, okay?

00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:01.286
I'm weak.

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:06.990
Now I got tissue all over the chopsticks too.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.151
I'd rather eat tissue.

00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:09.672
Look what you've done.

00:24:10.313 --> 00:24:13.576
Wait, Moco-chan, you'd rather eat tissue than natto?

00:24:13.596 --> 00:24:14.196
Probably.

00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:17.519
Not as healthy, but... No, it won't be healthy at all.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.322
Moco-chan, you have to do more than just look at it.

00:24:21.263 --> 00:24:23.524
Okay, this is three beans in one.

00:24:23.784 --> 00:24:25.165
Let me inspect it first.

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:25.885
It's three beans.

00:24:26.025 --> 00:24:26.986
It is three beans.

00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:28.146
That is three beans.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.187
Moco-chan is not lying.

00:24:30.267 --> 00:24:32.668
And there's some good stings going.

00:24:33.428 --> 00:24:34.409
Not enough though!

00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:35.269
There could be more.

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:36.530
This is three beans.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.771
The smell is already getting to me and it doesn't usually get to me.

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:45.174
But you're getting used to it now.

00:24:46.607 --> 00:24:47.907
Ruffians, I need help.

00:24:48.327 --> 00:24:51.188
I'm gonna put down the chopsticks.

00:24:51.468 --> 00:24:53.629
No, you should keep it close to your face.

00:24:53.649 --> 00:24:56.090
You almost pushed the beans into my lap!

00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:09.373
Ready?

00:25:10.053 --> 00:25:10.974
Ready!

00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:15.055
Okay, Moco-chan, we're gonna count down from five this time, Ruffians!

00:25:15.795 --> 00:25:17.556
You will give me the tea this time, right?

00:25:17.576 --> 00:25:18.756
Five!

00:25:19.436 --> 00:25:20.697
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:20.737 --> 00:25:22.917
You will give me the tea, you promise, right?

00:25:23.737 --> 00:25:24.418
You promise.

00:25:24.438 --> 00:25:25.478
Why should I tell Ruffians?

00:25:25.498 --> 00:25:26.538
She's gonna promise.

00:25:26.598 --> 00:25:29.199
Ruffians, should I give Moco-chan some tea or not?

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.500
She can't reach it.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.100
Her paws are too short.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.761
I didn't sleep, please.

00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:35.961
Ah.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:36.950
Ah.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.650
Yes!

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.771
Tea allowed.

00:25:38.831 --> 00:25:39.451
Tea allowed.

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:39.651
Yes, yes.

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:40.411
I see some gnaw.

00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.412
Give her the tea.

00:25:41.532 --> 00:25:43.052
I'd like to see all my gnaw.

00:25:43.432 --> 00:25:43.652
What?

00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:45.573
Gnaw.

00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:46.573
Okay!

00:25:46.693 --> 00:25:47.774
I guess I'll gnaw Moco-chan.

00:25:47.794 --> 00:25:48.634
Okay, last time I chewed it.

00:25:48.774 --> 00:25:50.775
And that wasn't a good... You should chew it.

00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:51.715
But you chew it.

00:25:51.775 --> 00:25:52.575
You chew it right.

00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:53.476
I chew it.

00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:55.796
Ah, but you can also just swallow it too.

00:25:55.816 --> 00:25:55.936
Ah.

00:25:58.863 --> 00:26:04.446
I feel like chewing it wasn't a great option, but I don't know what's better.

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:08.268
It's healthier if you chew because then your tummy will be happy.

00:26:08.288 --> 00:26:12.530
Chew it.

00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:15.431
Chewing is better.

00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:19.093
As long as it's chewing.

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:21.934
Yeah, I think so too.

00:26:22.054 --> 00:26:22.795
Okay!

00:26:24.235 --> 00:26:26.777
I have to take deep breaths, okay.

00:26:28.915 --> 00:26:30.736
This is three, Moco-chan!

00:26:30.776 --> 00:26:32.857
FUWAMOCO Morning's gonna end again!

00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:33.257
No!

00:26:33.837 --> 00:26:34.918
This is three, okay?

00:26:35.098 --> 00:26:37.159
Give me the credit for three, okay?

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:38.259
Okay!

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:39.300
Three small ones.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.940
Three, okay.

00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:42.461
Five!

00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:43.261
No, no, no, wait.

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:43.421
Four!

00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:44.522
Wait, wait, wait!

00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:45.182
Three!

00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:46.122
No, please stop!

00:26:46.603 --> 00:26:46.863
Two!

00:26:47.183 --> 00:26:48.823
No, no, no, I'm not ready for this!

00:26:48.843 --> 00:26:50.864
Moco-chan!

00:26:50.904 --> 00:26:52.225
Wait, wait, wait!

00:26:53.038 --> 00:26:54.279
Do I have another tissue?

00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:55.039
No, you can't.

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.720
This is the only tissue you get.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.901
Oh, I've got another tissue.

00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:58.341
What?

00:26:59.061 --> 00:26:59.402
What?

00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:00.562
What?

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:00.862
Okay.

00:27:01.543 --> 00:27:03.924
Okay.

00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:06.686
Okay, here we go for good, Ruffians.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:08.667
Ruffians are gonna get tired of pressing 5.

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.028
From 10, then.

00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:12.029
They can press 10.

00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:13.169
This is your third time.

00:27:13.209 --> 00:27:14.270
That's just pathetic.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.811
There's three 10s, okay?

00:27:15.891 --> 00:27:16.071
No.

00:27:16.091 --> 00:27:16.571
5!

00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:18.152
No, no, no!

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:19.153
I need more time!

00:27:19.873 --> 00:27:21.855
My heart needs to get ready, okay?

00:27:21.935 --> 00:27:24.597
We're gonna press 10, okay?

00:27:25.297 --> 00:27:27.799
My sister's just too pathetic. 10!

00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:40.850
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

00:27:40.928 --> 00:27:41.850
Oh, oh, oh.

00:27:42.212 --> 00:27:45.494
Moco-chan button!

00:27:45.554 --> 00:27:47.816
The doggy button took it out!

00:27:51.246 --> 00:27:53.989
I feel like I can't do this today.

00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:56.372
They are just soybeans.

00:27:56.392 --> 00:27:57.513
I feel like I can't.

00:27:57.533 --> 00:28:00.296
Are you gonna let the beans beat you?

00:28:00.316 --> 00:28:00.416
What?

00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:04.321
Don't let the beans beat you.

00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:06.683
I don't wanna let the beans beat me.

00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:07.664
Okay.

00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:08.185
Okay.

00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:08.665
Okay.

00:28:08.926 --> 00:28:09.146
Okay.

00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:09.626
Okay.

00:28:09.727 --> 00:28:10.267
Three!

00:28:10.287 --> 00:28:10.427
Two!

00:28:10.828 --> 00:28:11.008
One!

00:28:14.024 --> 00:28:15.986
Ruffians!

00:28:16.146 --> 00:28:16.727
Ruffians!

00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:18.990
I'm saying I can do it!

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.812
Why am I even bothered?

00:28:20.912 --> 00:28:22.854
No, I'm not defeated by beans!

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:24.896
I can beat the beans, okay?

00:28:30.345 --> 00:28:31.645
I'm not gonna count down.

00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:33.326
I'm not gonna count down anymore.

00:28:33.446 --> 00:28:34.166
I haven't done it.

00:28:34.306 --> 00:28:35.966
Do you deserve the tea anymore?

00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:36.786
I do deserve the tea!

00:28:36.806 --> 00:28:38.627
Better eat it fast, otherwise no tea!

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.727
Okay.

00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:41.607
Okay.

00:28:41.848 --> 00:28:42.108
Okay.

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:42.688
Okay.

00:28:45.168 --> 00:28:45.428
Okay.

00:28:45.688 --> 00:28:45.988
Okay.

00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:46.889
Okay.

00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:52.270
Okay.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.210
Stop touching her toge!

00:28:58.376 --> 00:28:58.636
Okay.

00:28:59.116 --> 00:28:59.417
Okay.

00:29:01.158 --> 00:29:01.898
Okay.

00:29:01.978 --> 00:29:03.879
Okay.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.320
Okay.

00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:05.881
Okay.

00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:08.062
I'm doing my best.

00:29:08.362 --> 00:29:09.503
Okay, I'm gonna do my best!

00:29:09.543 --> 00:29:10.143
For the Ruffians!

00:29:10.163 --> 00:29:10.864
For the Ruffians!

00:29:10.884 --> 00:29:12.185
For Porocom-nen-chan!

00:29:12.205 --> 00:29:13.605
I just need a hug.

00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:15.246
What's in there?

00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:15.927
It's in there!

00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:18.168
Moco-chan, eat it!

00:29:18.488 --> 00:29:19.729
Eat it!

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.011
The stings, I can see the stings.

00:29:23.091 --> 00:29:24.432
I touched Moco-chan's mouth.

00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:32.132
What is this sound?

00:29:32.192 --> 00:29:34.193
Moco-chan, that's no good!

00:29:35.054 --> 00:29:37.095
You want the beans to beat you, huh?

00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:41.497
Not today.

00:29:42.878 --> 00:29:43.839
Not today!

00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:45.840
Can I have tea still, please?

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.861
No, you don't deserve it!

00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:52.464
You didn't do anything, they just went in there.

00:29:53.845 --> 00:29:55.926
The beans won, huh?

00:29:56.536 --> 00:29:57.937
The bean's bigger.

00:29:58.878 --> 00:30:00.899
I want tea!

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.762
No tea.

00:30:03.822 --> 00:30:05.263
Don't cry, Moco-chan.

00:30:05.443 --> 00:30:06.664
It's tearing!

00:30:07.084 --> 00:30:08.085
No.

00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:11.588
Moco-chan, it's okay because you know what's next?

00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:16.872
A regular corner so you can forget about the apple, forget about the beans.

00:30:16.912 --> 00:30:19.053
Just savor the taste in your mouth.

00:30:19.093 --> 00:30:20.274
Maybe for a little bit longer.

00:30:20.314 --> 00:30:20.815
Cough drop.

00:30:21.355 --> 00:30:21.936
Cough drop.

00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:25.118
Goodbye.

00:30:25.378 --> 00:30:26.299
Thank you, Tochigi.

00:30:26.937 --> 00:30:29.120
My little sister is so weak.

00:30:30.241 --> 00:30:31.802
We're guard dogs, Moco-chan.

00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:34.826
You can't let some silly natto beat you.

00:30:37.472 --> 00:30:40.593
FUWAMOCO-chan, who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:30:41.054 --> 00:30:45.195
I don't know.

00:30:45.816 --> 00:30:47.056
This is Ozzy!

00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:49.837
You're good at breaking just like me, huh?

00:30:50.718 --> 00:30:55.160
Nato broke you, Nato-chan.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.460
Hi!

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.162
I almost called Moco-chan Nato-chan.

00:30:59.342 --> 00:31:03.904
Why would you call me that?

00:31:04.424 --> 00:31:06.425
You just want to hurt me, don't you?

00:31:08.551 --> 00:31:10.893
Well, Nato-chan, what do you think?

00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:13.634
He's breaking, like breakdancing, right?

00:31:14.014 --> 00:31:16.115
That's what I look like when I'm broken, too.

00:31:17.496 --> 00:31:18.917
Yeah, I don't know.

00:31:18.937 --> 00:31:21.158
Yeah, maybe not so much dancing.

00:31:21.178 --> 00:31:23.259
Maybe he's kind of broken, too.

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.360
But you know, he's cute.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.601
I bet you he's crying.

00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.102
He's doing his best, so... Like me.

00:31:29.122 --> 00:31:31.343
Not like Moco-chan.

00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:32.264
Or Nato-chan.

00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:33.244
Not like Nato-chan.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:33.845
No!

00:31:33.865 --> 00:31:34.365
Yeah, but...

00:31:35.547 --> 00:31:36.108
Ozzy.

00:31:36.368 --> 00:31:36.688
Ozzy.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.289
Such a cutie.

00:31:39.589 --> 00:31:41.150
Moco-chan, how does he BAU BAU?

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.112
Does maybe he sing along with the music while he breaks?

00:31:45.712 --> 00:31:53.436
I feel like his BAU BAU would be... Not two BAU BAUs.

00:31:53.556 --> 00:31:54.797
Just one BAU BAU.

00:31:55.537 --> 00:31:56.838
One BAU BAU at a time.

00:31:56.858 --> 00:31:58.299
Along with the music maybe?

00:32:01.861 --> 00:32:07.005
You know, Ozzy is very silly and has a bit of a creative side, I think.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:10.808
Just like me.

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:18.895
And you know, I think Ozzy, not only do they want to impress you with their breakdown skills, but also...

00:32:19.535 --> 00:32:23.356
I think they want to show how much they want to protect you, you know?

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:24.597
They love you!

00:32:24.617 --> 00:32:25.317
Just like me.

00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:33.359
So, make sure you don't get too mad if maybe the dancing gets a bit out of hand sometimes.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.100
Don't get too mad at me.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.301
BAU BAU!

00:32:41.702 --> 00:32:42.022
Next!

00:32:43.042 --> 00:32:44.342
Did a Ruffian go on a walk?

00:32:47.318 --> 00:32:49.620
De-den!

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:49.701
Oho!

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:51.583
Look at the leaves!

00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:53.785
I can smell the photo.

00:32:54.145 --> 00:32:55.707
The green all these way!

00:32:55.727 --> 00:33:00.252
I can see that you can almost smell how fresh and crisp the air is.

00:33:00.432 --> 00:33:01.793
It doesn't smell like natto.

00:33:02.915 --> 00:33:05.818
It wouldn't smell like natto, right?

00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:11.706
But you know, I can't believe how fast the seasons are changing, you know?

00:33:12.066 --> 00:33:14.088
It's almost the end of September, Ruffians!

00:33:14.108 --> 00:33:15.009
Do you believe it?

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:16.570
Are we sure it's not August?

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.211
I feel like it's the beginning of August.

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:18.591
No.

00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:20.232
I feel like it is.

00:33:20.272 --> 00:33:22.434
It's really gone by so, so fast.

00:33:22.494 --> 00:33:23.034
Don't say that!

00:33:24.155 --> 00:33:25.396
Don't say that, okay?

00:33:25.836 --> 00:33:26.597
It's not fall.

00:33:27.277 --> 00:33:28.658
It's autumn, isn't it?

00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:33.193
You know, I hope you had a really great one.

00:33:33.334 --> 00:33:37.658
Maybe you bundled up a little bit because it's getting pretty chilly out maybe.

00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:41.342
Maybe you had an even greater brunch too.

00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:42.623
BAU BAU!

00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:48.949
Wow, what's our Question of the Day?

00:33:48.969 --> 00:33:57.775
Our Question of the Day is... Recently, I've noticed how many bad habits I've formed in my life over the years.

00:33:57.855 --> 00:34:01.357
I want to break these habits and be a better person for FUWAMOCO.

00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:06.500
Thank you, my... I'm sure you're fine just the way you are, too.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:12.023
But it's always good to, you know, want to be a little bit of a new dog, too, right?

00:34:12.043 --> 00:34:14.004
Challenge yourself, right?

00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:18.278
Even on days when you feel like you can't challenge new things.

00:34:18.638 --> 00:34:20.339
Even on those days, too.

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:21.839
Extra good on those days.

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:22.720
I challenged it.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.381
It didn't go well, though.

00:34:24.881 --> 00:34:25.921
You can do it, Ruffians!

00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:29.363
Moco-chan took a bullet today for you.

00:34:30.243 --> 00:34:34.686
But what are some bad habits that you girls have had, and how did you overcome them?

00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:36.546
Or did you overcome them?

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:44.956
I guess one of my bad habits is that I'm kind of picky when it comes to food.

00:34:45.496 --> 00:34:46.518
Is that a bad habit?

00:34:46.578 --> 00:34:47.539
Isn't that just normal?

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.381
We're a bit picky.

00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:55.666
We have a funny sense of taste, maybe, so... Maybe just a bit.

00:34:55.946 --> 00:34:59.769
That's not something that... In some areas, we're not gonna overcome that.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.375
FUWAMOCO's FUWAMOCO, but not always an area Moco-chan's gonna overcome, right?

00:35:05.795 --> 00:35:06.636
That's the point.

00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:07.356
That's the point.

00:35:07.436 --> 00:35:09.619
That's the goal.

00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:11.720
But you know, other bad habits...

00:35:14.403 --> 00:35:19.344
I guess, I think you could say we used to be really bad perfectionists, you know?

00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:20.944
It's not very good.

00:35:21.044 --> 00:35:25.825
You know, they say, don't let perfect be the enemy of good, right?

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.806
And that's exactly it.

00:35:27.866 --> 00:35:32.747
You know, if you want to be perfect all the time, you'll never get anything done.

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:35.107
You'll just be frozen in fear, right?

00:35:35.187 --> 00:35:35.847
So just do!

00:35:36.247 --> 00:35:36.748
Don't think!

00:35:36.928 --> 00:35:37.908
Don't think!

00:35:37.968 --> 00:35:38.448
Just do it.

00:35:39.684 --> 00:35:42.927
It might not be great at first, but that's okay.

00:35:43.147 --> 00:35:46.671
I feel like as long as it's fun, then that's good enough, you know?

00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:55.339
And you'll get better just by doing it, so... Even though it might be tough to kind of just forget about those feelings, but... It's a bit uncomfy, right?

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:55.699
Do it!

00:35:55.759 --> 00:35:57.781
Just forget about them.

00:35:59.508 --> 00:36:02.550
Remember, nobody can be perfect.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.491
Perfect is boring too you know.

00:36:04.691 --> 00:36:08.553
And there's a lot of beauty in our imperfections too.

00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:11.755
So just be yourself and do your best.

00:36:12.015 --> 00:36:17.158
And please don't think that FUWAMOCO is perfect because that's not true at all.

00:36:17.538 --> 00:36:18.679
We're not perfect.

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:20.961
We don't wake up on time all the time.

00:36:20.981 --> 00:36:22.542
We have grumpy days.

00:36:22.562 --> 00:36:25.305
You know, sometimes we just can't do it.

00:36:25.525 --> 00:36:27.687
But we do our best!

00:36:28.087 --> 00:36:29.388
And that's all we can do.

00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:31.290
Exactly.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.773
You know, I think we have gotten much better with perfectionism.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:42.999
We aren't really like that anymore, but we do have a certain way of doing things that we like to do.

00:36:45.532 --> 00:36:46.334
We're a bit stubborn.

00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:54.127
Also, you know, they say it's not good to have a phone beside you when you're in bed, right?

00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:58.254
But it's tricky because what wakes you up?

00:36:59.403 --> 00:36:59.703
It's tough.

00:36:59.723 --> 00:36:59.843
Yeah.

00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:02.884
I would like to not look at it an hour before bed.

00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:29.477
Yeah, we've been trying, but still not quite there, right?

00:37:30.038 --> 00:37:35.243
Maybe that's a challenge that we could try to take on together, Ruffians!

00:37:37.085 --> 00:37:37.906
BAU BAU!

00:37:37.946 --> 00:37:40.228
Thank you for the questions!

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:48.938
Ruffians, we're always looking for more submissions, so please ask us your questions, your works, all those things!

00:37:48.978 --> 00:37:50.019
We'll be waiting!

00:37:50.259 --> 00:37:51.721
BAU BAU!

00:37:51.741 --> 00:37:52.862
And our next stream!

00:37:54.448 --> 00:37:56.911
We have De-den!

00:37:57.352 --> 00:38:06.463
Well, tonight we're going to be shifting gears a little bit to focus on some of our homework and recording that we absolutely need to get done.

00:38:06.903 --> 00:38:10.328
Tomorrow we're going to be having a collab stream with Calli-senpai!

00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:24.655
She's prepared a very special game show where we'll be going head to head, paw to paw, to see just what twins are really like, and to see how similar, maybe how different we are, right?

00:38:25.975 --> 00:38:29.777
I wonder, Ruffians, maybe we'll find out something shocking.

00:38:29.817 --> 00:38:32.858
We'll have to see.

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:35.220
BAU BAU!

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.561
And before we go, let's take a quick peek at our schedule.

00:38:40.757 --> 00:38:41.738
On Wednesday.

00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:46.422
Fuwawa is going to be doing her first solo stream.

00:38:46.923 --> 00:38:49.225
I'll be challenging myself this week too.

00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:52.708
Maybe this week's theme is challenge.

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:53.829
I feel like that's every week.

00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:56.531
It should be the theme every week.

00:38:57.092 --> 00:38:58.213
Not just that though.

00:38:58.373 --> 00:39:02.657
I'll be hunting ghosts on my own and having claustrophobia.

00:39:02.717 --> 00:39:03.177
Good luck!

00:39:03.337 --> 00:39:05.439
Thanks Moco-chan, that doesn't mean much from you.

00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:10.464
Ruffians, could you please help me lots?

00:39:11.544 --> 00:39:16.048
Yeah, I want to be able to level up to become a stronger guard dog, you know?

00:39:16.108 --> 00:39:21.452
And maybe hopefully make a little bit of money so I can buy more of the strong flashlights.

00:39:21.472 --> 00:39:22.934
Yeah, those are important, right?

00:39:22.954 --> 00:39:25.856
Yeah, you know, that way I'm not that scared.

00:39:26.116 --> 00:39:29.879
I'll be scared, but it'll be maybe a little bit helpful.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.083
Please, Ruffians, please be there to help hold my paw, okay?

00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:36.925
BAU BAU.

00:39:37.904 --> 00:39:39.527
We have lots of fun things to do.

00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:40.508
Please join us for more guys too!

00:39:40.528 --> 00:39:40.708
BAU BAU!

00:39:48.248 --> 00:39:54.533
Well, Moco-chan, another FUWAMOCO Morning comes to an end, and it hasn't been 20 minutes at all.

00:39:55.013 --> 00:39:59.277
But we have still one more thing!

00:40:00.057 --> 00:40:00.818
Oh, what's this?

00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:03.240
A black box with a question mark?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.000
Question.

00:40:04.281 --> 00:40:04.381
Oh.

00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:11.806
Well, maybe some of the doggy packs should keep their eyes open tonight for something special.

00:40:12.007 --> 00:40:14.649
But don't look forward to it that much.

00:40:14.989 --> 00:40:15.549
It's just something.

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:16.390
I don't know.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:17.351
It might be cool.

00:40:18.271 --> 00:40:21.512
It's up to you.

00:40:21.612 --> 00:40:22.452
It's up to you.

00:40:22.752 --> 00:40:24.193
That's why there's a question mark on it.

00:40:24.373 --> 00:40:26.033
That's why there's a question mark.

00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:29.774
BAU BAU!

00:40:30.154 --> 00:40:34.915
While we started a new week together, FUWAMOCO Morning has come to an end.

00:40:35.335 --> 00:40:42.757
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:43.878
Yami-sama!

00:40:43.918 --> 00:40:44.698
BAU BAU!

00:40:45.418 --> 00:40:45.918

00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:46.498

00:40:46.538 --> 00:40:47.498

00:40:47.518 --> 00:40:48.499

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:48.959

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:49.999

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.200

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:54.920

00:41:08.063 --> 00:41:12.565
To every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!
