00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.699
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.944
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:18.747
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.787 --> 00:05:20.329
BAU BAU!

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.590
Moco-chan!

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.091
BAU BAU!

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:23.092
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.613
Ruffians!

00:05:28.397 --> 00:05:30.720
Good morning!

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.943
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:33.963 --> 00:05:37.146
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:40.209
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.170
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:44.733
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:47.155
BAU BAU!

00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:48.496
Are you good, Moco-chan?

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:52.700
I think... Maybe there's a frog living in my throat.

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:59.531
Well today, Ruffians, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:04.915
Thank you for joining us for our 118th episode!

00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:05.375
BAU BAU!

00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:13.342
Any new Ruffians today?

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:17.647
Let us explain exactly what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:23.115
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:23.355 --> 00:06:23.916
A.K.A.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:24.937
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.781
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:33.664
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:38.947
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:42.829
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.390
BAU BAU!

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.711
A brand new morning.

00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.452
It's the middle of the week.

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:52.193
The end of the week.

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.360
How is it the middle of the week?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.241
Time just goes by so fast, Ruffians!

00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:02.581
But you've already made it this far!

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:06.582
But it's just not that much further off, you know.

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:08.523
And there's lots of fun stuff, huh?

00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:10.423
It's the end of the week, you know.

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:12.864
Not quite Friday, though.

00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:13.864
But!

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:17.766
Well, we're still gonna have a bunch of fun this week, right, Ruffians?

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:20.366
Even before the weekend.

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:22.047
But, uh...

00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:23.881
Huh?

00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.382
There's been some bad news.

00:07:30.103 --> 00:07:31.923
Tell me Moco-chan, what's the bad news?

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.224
There's been a Pero Sighting.

00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:36.624
Why?

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:37.625
I don't know!

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:40.705
It was kind of concerning.

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:45.127
A little bit weird when there was no Pero Sightings.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.988
But... Well, let's see!

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:52.754
Okay, let's take a look.

00:07:53.054 --> 00:07:54.815
Where was Pero spotted?

00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:57.377
De-den!

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:03.781
Is Pero allowed to be doing that, Ruffians?

00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:05.122
A balloon!

00:08:05.562 --> 00:08:13.728
You know, he is big and all muscle and everything, but I don't think it's okay for him to be such an important air balloon, you know?

00:08:14.408 --> 00:08:18.631
In an event like this, the Olympics, you know?

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.712
Ruffians!

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.411
Do you approve of this?

00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:24.933
Do you think this is a good idea?

00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:27.976
You think the little wings?

00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:30.538
I don't think the little wings are doing anything.

00:08:30.558 --> 00:08:32.239
I don't know.

00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:34.541
Would you ride on the Pero balloon?

00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:38.024
I'll give you a needle.

00:08:38.044 --> 00:08:41.146
No, no.

00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:42.127
It trusts you.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.521
You were right!

00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:50.544
It is good that he's doing something maybe to help out.

00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:51.305
Is this helping out?

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:52.586
It's doing something, right?

00:08:52.646 --> 00:08:53.007
Something.

00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:53.807
Something.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:57.611
Not too sure what it is, but... Transportation?

00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.332
Transportation!

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:04.176
But... I don't know.

00:09:04.236 --> 00:09:06.078
I don't think... You try it at least once.

00:09:06.618 --> 00:09:07.840
I don't think a pin will work.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.082
I think, you know, we should just shoot him out of the sky.

00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:11.383
What?! !

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.424
Well... Wait, what if he spots Pudding?

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:18.024
We don't know!

00:09:18.044 --> 00:09:20.005
We should neutralize it.

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.107
Like the birds!

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:25.949
No, the birds are better than Pero.

00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:31.613
The birds in New York City... But this isn't in New York City, Moco-chan.

00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:36.531
I don't see any birds, it could be New York City.

00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.713
That's because I probably was scared off by Pero.

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:41.855
Okay, decision made, we shoot him out of the sky.

00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:44.677
BAU BAU!

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:50.822
Moco-chan, all you're thinking about is New York right now because of Breaking Dimensions?

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:51.222
No!

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:53.004
I'm thinking of something else!

00:09:53.264 --> 00:09:53.404
Oh!

00:09:53.804 --> 00:09:54.325
Like what?

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:57.908
You might have seen Ruffians, but we had...

00:10:01.628 --> 00:10:01.928
A new song!

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:05.992
You think it's a Breaking Dimensions, huh?

00:10:06.152 --> 00:10:07.574
Y'all Ruffians!

00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:09.376
A new song?

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:12.679
A new song for hololive English just came out!

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:13.740
Did you see?

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.481
Guess what?

00:10:14.501 --> 00:10:15.622
It's Breaking Dimensions!

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:17.504
Yes, that's the title!

00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:18.765
Who could've guessed?

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.627
The lyrics are so nice, right?

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:22.848
So emotional!

00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:50.407
You know, it's generally known as Hashtag First Promise.

00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:52.669
Hashtag First... Advent!

00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:56.349
I don't know.

00:10:56.369 --> 00:10:58.751
Maybe it's just because we're Advent.

00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:04.394
But I really feel like everything comes together once we join them in the end of the song.

00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:04.654
Right?

00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:06.015
I like Nerissa's part.

00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:07.255
Right?

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:08.156
Yeah.

00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.017
Let's rebel!

00:11:10.077 --> 00:11:10.837
And Biboo!

00:11:11.197 --> 00:11:11.738
Biboo!

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.579
It's very cute.

00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:17.001
Not too surprising.

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:21.763
I really think of the choreography, Ruffians.

00:11:21.883 --> 00:11:23.104
It's very cute, but uh...

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:25.785
I wasn't very good at the body rolls.

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:32.387
Since the body rolls... I can't do them very well, Ruffians.

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:35.687
But I'll do my best!

00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:38.268
You thought it was good?

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.308
It's kind of funny.

00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:43.949
I'm doing my best, okay?

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.029
But... Well...

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:59.603
Ruffians, maybe one day in the future someday we'll get to perform it for you.

00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:01.564
Maybe one day.

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:03.286
I'm sure that day will come.

00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:04.486
Eventually.

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:05.647
Eventually.

00:12:05.707 --> 00:12:06.768
There's a lot of days!

00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:09.750
Yeah, but please listen to it a lot!

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.571
I like it because it's quite different from countries around the world.

00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:13.592
Right, it's sort of a cool feeling.

00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:14.172
Yeah.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.033
Like, cooling.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.221
Not like cool, like wow, cool, but like refreshing.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:25.543
Like a, what's it, an ice cone.

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.403
An ice cone!

00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:31.424
Like an ice cone, like a, what's it, an ice cone.

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.785
A snow cone, like that.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.452
Like an ice cone.

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:40.992
Are you like that it was in English?

00:12:41.332 --> 00:12:43.173
Why are the lyrics in English?

00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:46.334
Connect the World is also in English, so please check it out too!

00:12:46.354 --> 00:12:52.776
But the lyrics you know about me, you can kind of be able to connect more deeply with it maybe.

00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:54.757
And especially you know if you don't speak Japanese.

00:12:55.077 --> 00:12:59.802
Make sure you get your streaming tickets!

00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:13.714
You can get your streaming tickets for Breaking Dimensions, a two-day concert over on SPWN on Spawn or E+, so please go check out the Breaking Dimensions website.

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:23.698
Especially if you want to see more FUWAMOCO on the big stage, more Advent on the big stage, this is the number one thing you can do to make that happen!

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.378
Okay, Ruffians?

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:27.799
Please check it out, okay?

00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:30.439
BAU BAU!

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.400
I'm so excited, breaking the legend is like here.

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:35.521
It's almost now.

00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:37.041
It's like next week.

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:38.442
Yeah.

00:13:38.742 --> 00:13:39.882
BAU BAU.

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:43.303
Well, also very soon, we have

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:45.858
Yo!

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:46.760
FUWAMOCO!

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:56.293
Our unofficial world tour continues because very shortly this weekend we're gonna be performing in Seoul at PopCon!

00:13:56.313 --> 00:13:57.054
Yeah!

00:13:57.074 --> 00:13:58.036
In Korea!

00:13:58.456 --> 00:13:59.417
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:00.058 --> 00:14:01.419
In Korea!

00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:03.900
We're so, so excited!

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.001
I'm a little nervous too!

00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:09.043
I'm not facial because it just happened.

00:14:09.943 --> 00:14:19.949
Yeah, we've had such a lucky opportunity to go to so many different places across the world and see lots of different Ruffians and BAU BAU together!

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:23.891
And this time, this is our next, our next, our next stop!

00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:25.091
Yeah!

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:27.853
We're so excited to be able to meet some

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:35.296
Korean skills are not very good.

00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:38.557
I think our Australian was better.

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:41.078
And that says a lot, right Moco-chan?

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:46.100
But it's okay because we're fans!

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.941
We'll definitely go BAU BAU lots together, right?

00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:52.362
BAU BAU just sends anything, right?

00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:58.005
But at BAU BAU we're gonna be doing a mini Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:02.787
Maybe we'll be singing some songs we don't usually often sing.

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:06.431
We're also gonna be doing a meet-and-greet too!

00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:10.637
So Inori gets to meet some BAUFUS up close!

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:19.489
BAU BAU!

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:19.889
That's it.

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:52.580
BAU BAU!

00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.545
On the topic of being nervous.

00:15:57.086 --> 00:16:03.152
Well yesterday, Ruffians, we had a really big collab together with

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.402
With AZKi-senpai and Akuma-senpai!

00:16:11.462 --> 00:16:14.643
It still feels like a dream, right Moco-chan?

00:16:14.663 --> 00:16:16.743
I woke up and I felt funny.

00:16:17.164 --> 00:16:19.364
That happened!

00:16:19.704 --> 00:16:20.645
You and them!

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.225
BAU BAU!

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:27.391
Yeah, we had so much fun and we are so honored.

00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:32.017
I felt like we were able to say that a lot to both AZKi-senpai and Akoe-senpai.

00:16:32.077 --> 00:16:35.561
But I feel like we still didn't say enough of how happy.

00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:37.704
Right, I felt like you made me funny, huh.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:49.509
Yeah, it was so much fun and it really meant so much to us too because it was our first ever and also last collab with Aqua-senpai.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.691
And we had so much fun singing all together.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.751
Aqua-senpai and AZKi-senpai.

00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:56.653
We saw a bunch of internet oldies together.

00:16:56.693 --> 00:16:58.153
Let's go Omiyagi.

00:16:58.193 --> 00:16:59.714
We had Yukai.

00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:03.415
Lots of fun stuff and you know some emotional songs too.

00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:05.256
Emotional rollercoaster.

00:17:05.376 --> 00:17:06.056
Yeah.

00:17:07.337 --> 00:17:19.126
It was really fun, but we were just so happy to be invited by AZKi-senpai because, you know, we were surprised to hear Aqua-senpai know that she's gonna be graduating.

00:17:19.446 --> 00:17:22.509
And we really wanted to be able to do something together with her!

00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:22.629
Yeah!

00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:24.210
And you know, right when we were sort of like,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:25.711
What should we do?

00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.552
What should we do?

00:17:26.652 --> 00:17:29.234
And AZKi-senpai messaged us!

00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:30.395
We're so thankful.

00:17:30.415 --> 00:17:30.855
So happy!

00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:37.200
But we were a bit surprised to hear that the reason Aqua-senpai ended up agreeing.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.904
Yeah, at first when we knew AZKi-senpai was like, I wanna do a karaoke together with Aqua-senpai, she was like, no.

00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:46.126
I don't want to do one-on-one, you know?

00:17:46.206 --> 00:17:51.388
But then she ended up agreeing because AZKi-senpai said that we would do it a lot!

00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:53.669
FUWAMOCO would be there too!

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:54.509
Yeah!

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:56.010
So we were really surprised!

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.971
We were like, did I just hear that right?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.693
Yeah, Akari-senpai said that she wanted to collab with us before, but...

00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:06.083
You know, Aqua-senpai is very shy.

00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:09.066
FUWAMOCO, we're really shy!

00:18:09.126 --> 00:18:09.666
Yeah, sure!

00:18:10.107 --> 00:18:15.271
We're so... You know, we wanna be able to clap more and more with our senpai, but it's always kinda hard, you know?

00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.612
We're just the noobies, the underdogs.

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:21.615
We do have kouhai now, but we're still the underdog noobies, so... Yeah, we wanna prove ourselves.

00:18:21.696 --> 00:18:22.976
Yeah, you know.

00:18:23.577 --> 00:18:26.639
Yeah, Aqua-senpai's really, really shy, right?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.261
But we're so happy.

00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:29.381
Yeah!

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.603
And it was a really fun collab too!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:32.203
Yeah!

00:18:32.324 --> 00:18:39.429
And I know when we were singing the emotional songs together too, we kinda wrote some letters for Aqua-senpai.

00:18:39.449 --> 00:18:43.171
And I always made her cry.

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:45.533
We were really shocked!

00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:46.994
You know?

00:18:47.134 --> 00:18:47.955
I don't know.

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:48.756
I'm confused.

00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:51.177
This is our first time together.

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:52.278
Oh no!

00:18:52.358 --> 00:18:53.719
What do we do, Moco-chan?

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.291
We're really happy.

00:18:57.651 --> 00:19:04.236
We know that our feelings got to Aqua-senpai and she received them, you know.

00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:09.360
And you know, both AZKi-senpai and Aqua-senpai, they were able to sing Fake Fake Fake together!

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:17.686
Yeah, you know, Fake Fake Fake is one of AZKi-senpai's really early songs where Aqua-senpai is like the main part of her MV.

00:19:17.987 --> 00:19:19.488
She's like the star.

00:19:19.548 --> 00:19:20.809
The star of the MV.

00:19:21.229 --> 00:19:24.251
And that was the first time that they ever sang it together.

00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:24.552
Sang it?

00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:28.822
The other day with AZKi-chan.

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:35.206
And you know, we also got to sing Akoa-senpai's song Kaesou Deshou together too.

00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:37.727
That's one of my favorite FUWAMOCO songs.

00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:39.448
Yeah, we were able to request it!

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:44.371
I felt a little bit bad, like AZKi-senpai, we wanna sing this song!

00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.633
We were invited, but we wanna sing this song!

00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:49.454
Making requests, right!

00:19:50.074 --> 00:19:51.655
What are these demon dogs doing?

00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:54.697
We're so happy we were able to have the time.

00:19:55.137 --> 00:19:56.098
Both of us!

00:19:56.178 --> 00:19:56.999
Not just Fuwawa!

00:20:16.413 --> 00:20:19.876
I was so nervous that one.

00:20:21.057 --> 00:20:22.838
But also Ruffians!

00:20:22.858 --> 00:20:25.600
Aisuke-senpai and Aqua-senpai!

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.765
They have a brand new cover song coming out tomorrow morning of I'm My Moco.

00:20:32.785 --> 00:20:36.808
So please go check it out on Aisuke-senpai's channel too!

00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:44.013
And for Ruffians who weren't able to watch the karaoke collab too, it is archived on Aisuke-senpai's channel.

00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:46.555
It's very confusing.

00:20:46.655 --> 00:20:48.416
It has nothing to do with Moco-chan.

00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:08.833
BAU BAU!

00:21:08.873 --> 00:21:11.954
Thank you again, Aki-senpai!

00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:14.076
Thank you, Ako-senpai!

00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:15.837
BAU BAU!

00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:20.159
Fuwawa is related to Moco-chan, that is true.

00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:21.680
I am related.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.781
Moco-chan is related to Fuwawa, yes.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:28.484
Unrelated.

00:21:28.564 --> 00:21:29.324
Ruffian.

00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:31.685
I don't know if you've seen this.

00:21:33.448 --> 00:21:41.771
It was just just released, but we appeared in a very silly story on the hololive YouTube channel!

00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:43.131
On the main channel!

00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:44.391
Together with Noe-chan!

00:21:44.431 --> 00:21:46.072
Did you see it?

00:21:46.252 --> 00:21:47.953
It's still very new!

00:21:48.193 --> 00:21:48.993
Very new!

00:21:49.153 --> 00:21:49.593
Fresh!

00:21:50.193 --> 00:21:54.054
Yeah, it was really silly, but it was really silly!

00:21:54.134 --> 00:21:58.056
Yeah, we are totally no FUWAMOCO, please be really extra silly!

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:02.237
Since this time it's a bit more of a comedy skit, the first time we've ever kind of done this.

00:22:03.137 --> 00:22:04.998
It was indeed very silly.

00:22:05.418 --> 00:22:10.559
I know Nerissa-senpai, she's being very kind, teaching us all about Japan.

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:13.720
You know, since we're exchange students, we just came to Japan.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.441
But, we kind of think she talks too much.

00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:18.101
It's very silly!

00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:22.522
And you know, the punchline is that our actual thoughts are very, very rude!

00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:24.483
And it's something that we never really say.

00:22:24.503 --> 00:22:24.703
Yeah.

00:22:28.624 --> 00:22:37.948
FUWAMOCO We really like Japanese comedies, so we're really curious about trying more of these kind of things too.

00:22:37.968 --> 00:22:38.349
So, hopefully...

00:22:57.397 --> 00:23:00.839
Maybe we can be a little bit more silly together with my senpai too.

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:01.920
Yeah.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.981
Comedian idols.

00:23:05.642 --> 00:23:06.462
BAU BAU.

00:23:06.642 --> 00:23:07.262
I don't know.

00:23:07.282 --> 00:23:08.503
We're FUWAMOCO!

00:23:08.963 --> 00:23:12.505
I don't think we're very funny, but maybe we'll be funny one day.

00:23:12.645 --> 00:23:13.306
We're silly.

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:13.906
We're silly.

00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:15.747
BAU BAU!

00:23:15.847 --> 00:23:17.768
BAU BAU!

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:20.250
Nobunaga-senpai's voice is so cute.

00:23:23.851 --> 00:23:26.815
FUWAMOCO's Summer Memories.

00:23:39.632 --> 00:23:42.213
Together with you!

00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:51.536
I'm sure Ruffians, you know, it's one of the things on the holosummer bingo, in case you didn't know, so, we're getting it completed now!

00:23:52.677 --> 00:23:58.298
You know, Ruffians, I'm sure you're the same as you, little puppy, but with FUWAMOCO we're puppies!

00:23:58.839 --> 00:24:02.200
One of my favorite things in the summertime is to play outside!

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:08.562
Outside of our home in the Northwest Passage, and you know, like we shared with you, we have the big stream,

00:24:08.882 --> 00:24:10.243
Yeah, the river!

00:24:10.404 --> 00:24:11.825
I always like to play in it.

00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:13.466
And there'd be these, like, bugs.

00:24:13.607 --> 00:24:15.288
Yeah, like water bugs.

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:20.753
Maybe these things floating on the water and you try to catch them, but then... I don't know, they're always really scary.

00:24:20.813 --> 00:24:21.354
Run away.

00:24:21.374 --> 00:24:23.456
You catch them and then they run away.

00:24:23.476 --> 00:24:24.296
I don't know.

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:26.118
But you catch them too and then it's not very fun.

00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:27.720
It's fun to see them on the water.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.200
Right?

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.482
Yeah, they can go on the ground too.

00:24:30.522 --> 00:24:33.025
But then it's just the one one.

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:38.188
So we play with those, we play in the water and splash and stuff.

00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:40.449
And you know when we get popsicles from Mama Puppy?

00:24:40.489 --> 00:24:41.470
Yeah!

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.170
Popsicles!

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.092
I remember going on like a blanket on the run.

00:24:45.272 --> 00:24:45.792
Yeah.

00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:50.115
And you know, then we have them, but there'd be like a little green bug.

00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:51.155
Yeah.

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:52.956
I smell like a grasshopper.

00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:54.117
No, but they hop around.

00:24:54.457 --> 00:24:54.897
Yeah.

00:24:54.937 --> 00:24:56.158
They look friendly.

00:24:56.198 --> 00:24:58.939
So I remember watching them having popsicles.

00:24:59.299 --> 00:24:59.840
Yeah.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.382
And Mama Puppy would make the popsicles too!

00:25:04.062 --> 00:25:07.524
Yeah, I really want the orange flavored ones right now.

00:25:08.405 --> 00:25:11.367
I like the purple ones.

00:25:11.567 --> 00:25:12.968
The purple ones.

00:25:13.008 --> 00:25:13.128
Yeah.

00:25:13.148 --> 00:25:17.871
Then sometimes, you know, demon dogs, we like to BAU BAU.

00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:23.655
Sometimes I hear like other puppies kind of far away in the distance going BAU BAU!

00:25:24.316 --> 00:25:26.898
So then we'll be like BAU BAU!

00:25:28.072 --> 00:25:29.074
BAU BAU!

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.901
The voice tweet.

00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:41.842
Maybe for the younger Ruffians out there.

00:25:42.282 --> 00:25:42.963
Kinda like that.

00:25:42.983 --> 00:25:46.184
You don't know who's gonna receive it, but it's out there.

00:25:46.904 --> 00:25:47.425
Like that.

00:25:47.765 --> 00:25:49.065
It's very exciting.

00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:50.046
Like talking.

00:25:50.146 --> 00:25:52.467
No, you're not talking!

00:25:52.487 --> 00:25:54.848
You don't know who's gonna hear it.

00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:57.169
And you don't know who responds.

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:58.890
Right, they might BAU BAU back at you.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.190
You only hear the BAU BAU.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.451
So it's very exciting.

00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:04.272
Kinda like you're like...

00:26:05.332 --> 00:26:11.576
Oh, I don't know what's gonna happen from here on out, but at most you're probably just gonna get a bump bump back.

00:26:11.877 --> 00:26:12.137
Yeah.

00:26:12.657 --> 00:26:13.478
Yeah.

00:26:13.518 --> 00:26:17.020
Did you eat grasshoppers?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.460
No!

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.000
No!

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.022
It's fun to watch them.

00:26:20.042 --> 00:26:21.302
It's fun to watch them.

00:26:21.703 --> 00:26:23.044
Yeah, maybe you catch them.

00:26:23.524 --> 00:26:25.825
But you know if you're eating a popsicle, the popsicle's gonna be good.

00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:28.127
Then you don't need to eat a grasshopper, you have the popsicle.

00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:29.267
Yeah, you know.

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:31.909
Ruffians, why you don't eat this?

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.330
Do we catch them?

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.090
Yeah.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.091
Yeah, you catch them.

00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:37.412
You have fun.

00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:39.132
Fireflies are better!

00:26:39.352 --> 00:26:41.313
I would like to see fireflies!

00:26:41.694 --> 00:26:44.355
Moco-chan, do you remember throwing them at each other?

00:26:47.444 --> 00:26:56.235
Yeah, just a lot of time spent outside enjoying the nature, you know?

00:26:56.575 --> 00:26:59.138
Everything's so nice in the North Post.

00:26:59.158 --> 00:27:01.961
The dandeboubous too!

00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:04.785
Summertime is when the dandeboubous are in full force.

00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:06.233
Yeah.

00:27:06.413 --> 00:27:11.695
Hopefully Ruffians, maybe that made you remember some of your memories.

00:27:11.715 --> 00:27:12.716
Some of my memories.

00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:14.957
Or maybe it was completely new to you.

00:27:15.557 --> 00:27:18.899
If it was, maybe you should go outside and try to do the same.

00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:21.140
Maybe have some pupsicles.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.640
Yeah.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.881
Take a blanket on on the grass and look at the bugs.

00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:25.362
If it's not too hot.

00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:25.862
Okay.

00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:26.323
Yeah.

00:27:26.343 --> 00:27:27.443
You can't remember.

00:27:27.483 --> 00:27:28.524
Where is Pero's house?

00:27:30.598 --> 00:27:31.258
Doesn't matter.

00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:33.359
No.

00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:34.719
That's enough, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:37.940
Let's just solve our memories!

00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:39.561
BAU BAU!

00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:41.842
BAU BAU!

00:27:42.262 --> 00:27:45.763
Yeah, we did a lot of silly fun things.

00:27:45.943 --> 00:27:47.243
Just the two of us, right?

00:27:47.263 --> 00:27:48.204
Just silly stuff.

00:27:48.304 --> 00:27:49.024
Yeah.

00:27:50.204 --> 00:27:51.645
But Ruffians!

00:27:51.925 --> 00:27:53.025
It's the middle of the week!

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:54.706
You've been doing your best.

00:27:54.846 --> 00:27:55.826
How is it going?

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:57.767
How is it the middle of the week, huh?

00:27:59.275 --> 00:28:01.196
Is a bit a little bit rough?

00:28:02.576 --> 00:28:07.398
Maybe Moco-chan, you have some head pads for the Ruffians?

00:28:08.398 --> 00:28:11.239
A bit rough.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.081
Ruffians!

00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:18.342
You did it!

00:28:19.342 --> 00:28:24.524
It's the middle of the week, and it's time that you to listen up.

00:28:27.783 --> 00:28:29.463
That you are going to listen up!

00:28:29.964 --> 00:28:33.104
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:28:33.784 --> 00:28:36.025
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:37.605
Mococo!

00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:39.506
Ruffians.

00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:44.367
Have you been trying something new recently?

00:28:45.507 --> 00:28:50.088
Maybe it's been a bit tricky for you?

00:28:52.354 --> 00:28:56.976
Maybe I left feeling sort of like I used to be able to pick up things so quickly!

00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.176
What happened?

00:28:59.356 --> 00:28:59.917
And you know what?

00:29:01.117 --> 00:29:01.997
That's okay!

00:29:02.898 --> 00:29:06.539
Sometimes it just takes us more time than we're used to to learn new things.

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:13.241
And just the fact that you're trying something outside of your comfort zone that you wouldn't usually do is amazing!

00:29:13.261 --> 00:29:19.743
And to be honest, at first, it probably won't go well.

00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:21.364
And that's fine!

00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:26.400
You'll slowly but surely gain more experience and get more skilled, okay?

00:29:27.021 --> 00:29:28.003
You don't need to rush!

00:29:28.964 --> 00:29:31.727
Remember, the journey is what's most important.

00:29:32.368 --> 00:29:35.192
Know how quickly you get to the end result that you want, okay?

00:29:36.293 --> 00:29:38.076
Let's keep doing our best together!

00:29:38.797 --> 00:29:40.218
Ganbatte desu!

00:29:40.258 --> 00:29:40.699
BAU BAU!

00:29:44.573 --> 00:29:45.214
Got it!

00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:50.139
FUWAMOCO will continue to try new things too.

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:51.420
Like harmony.

00:29:52.281 --> 00:29:52.922
I am.

00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:56.225
Let's do our best, FUWAMOCO!

00:29:56.245 --> 00:29:57.787
BAU BAU!

00:29:57.867 --> 00:30:02.912
Let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day today.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:04.794
Our Doggie of the Day is...

00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:08.227
Sam!

00:30:08.588 --> 00:30:11.271
And Olive!

00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:11.892
So cute!

00:30:11.932 --> 00:30:13.253
Such beautiful eyes!

00:30:13.714 --> 00:30:15.816
Did you feel a little bit confused there?

00:30:15.876 --> 00:30:18.759
Which doggy is the Doggie of the Day here?

00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:20.922
Plenty of it confused!

00:30:21.743 --> 00:30:22.424
Yeah!

00:30:22.444 --> 00:30:24.546
Together with the Ruffians!

00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:27.890
You know, Olive's obviously very friendly!

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.694
Just curling up close together with the Ruffians there!

00:30:31.714 --> 00:30:31.814
Right?

00:30:32.615 --> 00:30:34.317
A bit envious, huh?

00:30:34.357 --> 00:30:35.819
Moco-chan, you feel envious!

00:30:36.722 --> 00:30:41.725
I like to hang out with the Ruffians like this too.

00:30:42.126 --> 00:30:44.247
It does look very confident, right?

00:30:44.687 --> 00:30:45.127
Yeah.

00:30:45.768 --> 00:30:47.569
You thought it was about the Ruffians!

00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:51.551
Ruffians do the Doggie of the Day every day!

00:30:51.811 --> 00:30:52.252
Got it.

00:30:56.114 --> 00:31:00.096
Well, I'm so happy that all of us can make some new friends here!

00:31:03.827 --> 00:31:04.548
Jr.

00:31:04.968 --> 00:31:06.890
3D Watch Party.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.852
BAU BAU!

00:31:11.033 --> 00:31:20.281
How does all of BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:31:21.682 --> 00:31:23.043
That's not what I was asking.

00:31:25.125 --> 00:31:25.586
Moco-chan!

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.872
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:41.497 --> 00:31:44.499
You know, Olive is just such a sweet doggie.

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:46.440
Very patient.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.800
Loves to make friends.

00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:56.305
And you know, I think she also really enjoys, you know, sharing the things that you're very passionate about together with you.

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:58.165
Because she loves you!

00:31:58.185 --> 00:32:00.507
She wants to have fun together with you.

00:32:00.547 --> 00:32:02.388
You enjoy your favorite things.

00:32:02.728 --> 00:32:04.429
She loves your favorite things!

00:32:05.129 --> 00:32:05.809
She loves you.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.131
BAU BAU!

00:32:11.492 --> 00:32:17.155
And next, for our walk of the day, we have... That one's called Moco-chan.

00:32:17.995 --> 00:32:19.216
The day I went on a walk.

00:32:19.796 --> 00:32:23.138
BAU BAU, where did we go?

00:32:23.578 --> 00:32:24.418
Ruffians!

00:32:24.878 --> 00:32:25.339
Dance!

00:32:33.182 --> 00:32:34.083
No!

00:32:34.503 --> 00:32:35.544
That wasn't today!

00:32:35.624 --> 00:32:38.486
That was a little while ago, Moco-chan!

00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:39.547
Hi!

00:32:39.607 --> 00:32:41.268
You're gonna break my heart!

00:32:41.288 --> 00:32:41.328
Hi!

00:32:41.349 --> 00:32:42.169
BAU BAU!

00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.369
Deh!

00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:42.830
No.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.990
Hi!

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.170
Deh!

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:43.510
Deh!

00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:46.332
BAU BAU!

00:33:00.515 --> 00:33:01.156
BAU BAU!

00:33:01.176 --> 00:33:03.299
I was about to say to the Ruffians.

00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:06.182
Ruffians, did you not go on a walk this time?

00:33:06.202 --> 00:33:08.705
Got lost on the walk.

00:33:09.426 --> 00:33:11.729
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:16.035
I'm so glad that you had such a nice walk together with the Ruffians.

00:33:16.315 --> 00:33:17.296
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:28.927
Going to Akiba MisDo at the end of your walk is one thing, but just you know, the best walks I find are ones together with friends.

00:33:28.947 --> 00:33:30.669
And ones that also have treats at the end.

00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:31.089
Always.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.133
But in FUWAMOCO, Akiba looks so nice.

00:33:35.273 --> 00:33:36.454
Beautiful weather.

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:40.257
And you got pon-de-rings too!

00:33:40.277 --> 00:33:44.681
Sometimes, more than often recently, they're sold out.

00:33:45.427 --> 00:33:49.911
Extra lucky Ruffians!

00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:52.974
BAU BAU!

00:33:53.054 --> 00:33:55.937
Secret land of the BAU BAU!

00:33:56.558 --> 00:34:03.184
We see that there's even more Ruffians visiting Akiba recently and we're really happy!

00:34:03.304 --> 00:34:04.445
BAU BAU!

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:07.188
And for the Question of the Day we have this!

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:09.210
De-den!

00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:12.514
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:16.579
Ako and Aisuke have been my GP Oshis for a long time!

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:22.646
So I was so happy to see my Kami Oshi FUWAMOCO sing together with them!

00:34:22.806 --> 00:34:23.567
BAU BAU!

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:28.912
I'm so happy to be able to sit together with them.

00:34:28.932 --> 00:34:32.735
Especially, you know, just being invited to such an amazing collab.

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:34.957
I could go on and on.

00:34:36.298 --> 00:34:39.941
hololive I'm often called Aqua Inkyan.

00:34:40.102 --> 00:34:44.265
My question is, do you consider yourself similar to her or are you more of a youkya?

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:45.747
Inkyan's more of like a...

00:34:46.992 --> 00:34:49.033
More of a... Indoor person.

00:34:49.133 --> 00:34:49.533
Introverted.

00:34:49.753 --> 00:34:51.314
Introverted person.

00:34:51.354 --> 00:34:53.575
You can more extra... Extraverted.

00:34:54.136 --> 00:34:54.556
Extraverted.

00:34:54.616 --> 00:34:55.316
That kind of thing.

00:34:56.197 --> 00:34:58.238
Wait, Ruffians, what do you think?

00:34:58.738 --> 00:34:59.298
Oh, oh.

00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:00.319
Yes!

00:35:05.562 --> 00:35:06.022
Which one?

00:35:06.122 --> 00:35:07.402
Which one is FUWAMOCO?

00:35:07.603 --> 00:35:07.803
Oh!

00:35:09.664 --> 00:35:09.804
Oh?

00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:13.265
Oh!

00:35:14.883 --> 00:35:16.084
I see lots of both.

00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:16.805
Right.

00:35:17.385 --> 00:35:22.069
Well, FUWAMOCO, we're definitely introverted.

00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:26.284
We just do our best to appear extra morning.

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.965
I think Advent is also like that.

00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:31.167
Advent is exactly the same.

00:35:31.387 --> 00:35:32.407
Even Nerissa!

00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:33.748
Even Nerissa, yeah.

00:35:33.768 --> 00:35:38.611
But Nerissa's the one that's like, oh, ah, okay, you have to talk to somebody.

00:35:38.691 --> 00:35:40.232
We all have to talk to somebody.

00:35:40.292 --> 00:35:41.213
Okay, Nerissa, go!

00:35:41.713 --> 00:35:46.216
I think it was funny because we were all at dinner the other day and I think...

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:47.612
Who was it?

00:35:47.652 --> 00:35:48.813
Someone wanted another drink.

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:50.513
Nerissa wanted another drink.

00:35:51.113 --> 00:35:54.375
And so she's like, FUWAMOCO, ask for another drink for me.

00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:55.915
And we're like, no, I don't want to do that.

00:35:55.935 --> 00:35:56.615
No, I don't want to.

00:35:56.695 --> 00:35:57.316
I don't want to.

00:35:57.336 --> 00:35:58.136
How are you doing?

00:35:58.336 --> 00:35:58.876
I don't want to.

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:01.837
Nerissa's like, you can speak Japanese, please ask.

00:36:02.277 --> 00:36:05.239
And we're like, no, I don't want to do it, Moco-chan, you did it.

00:36:05.259 --> 00:36:06.079
I did it before.

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:08.840
And then Biboo was just like, why?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.280
I'm sorry!

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.641
I'm sorry.

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:10.941
Yeah.

00:36:16.784 --> 00:36:21.068
We're all very introverted, but we do our best to be extroverted.

00:36:21.389 --> 00:36:23.991
Sometimes we're better than others, and that's how it is!

00:36:25.993 --> 00:36:28.576
Advent is all introverted.

00:36:29.537 --> 00:36:34.462
Maybe a little bit of a different introvert compared to Aqua-senpai.

00:36:35.022 --> 00:36:37.205
More or less, yeah.

00:36:38.394 --> 00:36:42.876
Maybe this is also a reason why we all get along so well, huh?

00:36:42.956 --> 00:36:43.116
Maybe?

00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:47.158
You could tell when we said we couldn't buy the konbini chicken.

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.369
Yeah.

00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:07.650
Yeah.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.170
Yeah.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.101
BAU BAU!

00:37:25.161 --> 00:37:27.982
Thank you, Mofius, for all your submissions!

00:37:28.002 --> 00:37:28.702
Pero Sighting.

00:37:28.802 --> 00:37:32.383
It'd be nice to get a Pero Sighting that makes us feel like... Yeah.

00:37:32.864 --> 00:37:33.304
Right?

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:34.084
Right.

00:37:34.184 --> 00:37:36.145
Every time it's like, Pero, no.

00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:37.445
Right?

00:37:37.785 --> 00:37:38.045
Right.

00:37:38.185 --> 00:37:39.606
You know, more doggy of the days.

00:37:39.726 --> 00:37:42.147
There's never a doggy that makes us go, rawr.

00:37:42.587 --> 00:37:42.867
Right?

00:37:44.203 --> 00:37:46.304
Please let us know what walks you've been going on.

00:37:46.444 --> 00:37:47.285
Yeah!

00:37:47.325 --> 00:37:50.687
I know I said last time but we've been getting some very good questions about things.

00:37:50.727 --> 00:37:52.348
Walks you've been going on don't rocks.

00:37:52.928 --> 00:37:53.248
No rocks.

00:37:54.049 --> 00:37:54.449
Yeah.

00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:56.370
Unless... Well...

00:37:57.662 --> 00:37:58.502
Ruffians!

00:37:58.603 --> 00:37:59.123
You know!

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:02.485
We have another stream coming up very soon!

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.666
And unfortunately there's a rock in it.

00:38:05.206 --> 00:38:06.507
And next stream!

00:38:06.707 --> 00:38:07.787
De-den!

00:38:07.927 --> 00:38:13.370
We're having a karaoke off-camera with Biboo!

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.031
Yeah!

00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:17.092
Diamond Dolls!

00:38:17.112 --> 00:38:17.352
Yeah!

00:38:17.392 --> 00:38:17.893
Very soon!

00:38:17.913 --> 00:38:19.974
Unfortunately there's a rock in it.

00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:21.114
Yeah.

00:38:21.855 --> 00:38:23.115
Not just fluff and fuzz.

00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:24.976
Fluff and fuzz on the rock.

00:38:24.996 --> 00:38:26.197
It's a fun, a fun rock a lot.

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:31.743
We're gonna have fun together.

00:38:32.484 --> 00:38:35.327
Maybe there might be some silliness that you'll have to catch.

00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:39.171
I never know what's gonna happen together with the Diamond Dogs!

00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:47.941
We definitely will be.

00:38:48.802 --> 00:38:51.263
I don't know, maybe.

00:38:51.363 --> 00:38:53.423
And speaking of collabs!

00:38:53.944 --> 00:39:00.026
Wow, basically we have our Advent 3D collab!

00:39:00.166 --> 00:39:06.428
On Saturday at 8pm PT, Advent will all be together for our very first 3D collab.

00:39:06.528 --> 00:39:08.349
Look at that, Ruffians!

00:39:10.049 --> 00:39:10.530
Don't miss it!

00:39:25.141 --> 00:39:26.161
You can't miss it!

00:39:26.401 --> 00:39:28.462
It's gonna be super fun!

00:39:28.682 --> 00:39:30.503
Remind your friends, okay?

00:39:30.523 --> 00:39:30.823
Yeah.

00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:31.903
Almost forgot.

00:39:32.043 --> 00:39:35.184
Yeah, but they know.

00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:36.604
FUWAMOCO's here.

00:39:36.764 --> 00:39:37.704
Here to remind you.

00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:38.545
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:40.085
It's gonna be fantastic!

00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:41.065
Will there be more violence?

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:42.186
You never know.

00:39:42.206 --> 00:39:43.606
We'll have them.

00:39:43.626 --> 00:39:44.386
Yummy taco pie!

00:39:44.406 --> 00:39:44.666
Noice!

00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:49.342
You'll have to be there to find us!

00:39:49.422 --> 00:39:50.022
Yes!

00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:51.062
Oppa!

00:39:51.082 --> 00:39:51.563
Mama!

00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:53.483
And my schedule!

00:39:54.044 --> 00:39:54.544
Oh well!

00:39:54.944 --> 00:39:57.385
FUWAMOCO we have our off club with Biboo.

00:39:57.425 --> 00:40:05.468
But on Friday at 6pm PT, we're also gonna be having a Rock n' Rawr Party together with you Ruffians!

00:40:05.548 --> 00:40:06.349
We also have the...

00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:11.270
There's a lot going on, I can't talk about it all right now.

00:40:11.671 --> 00:40:17.292
But on Rock n' Rawr Party, we're gonna be singing only hololive songs this time!

00:40:17.332 --> 00:40:21.734
So please, you know, get warmed up before breaking the mentions.

00:40:21.754 --> 00:40:26.215
And maybe sing along with us, get those penlights going!

00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:28.496
We're really excited, Ruffians!

00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:32.738
BAU BAU!

00:40:33.338 --> 00:40:41.901
And then also, very early morning on Sunday at 3am PT, we'll be having an off collab together with Haachama-senpai!

00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:44.022
Our first off collab together!

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:48.184
I'm very excited but a little nervous.

00:40:48.924 --> 00:40:50.004
I don't know what's gonna happen.

00:40:50.024 --> 00:40:53.386
You know we're playing Holococuna, a very scary game together with Haachama-senpai.

00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:54.806
It's our first scary game off collab.

00:40:54.926 --> 00:40:56.727
I don't know what if I was just...

00:40:57.445 --> 00:40:57.746
Don't.

00:40:59.188 --> 00:41:00.149
Don't poke me!

00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:05.317
You say don't to me but... But Hachama- Hachama-senpai might... No.

00:41:05.417 --> 00:41:06.278
Come up behind you.

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:07.300
She's coming.

00:41:09.536 --> 00:41:11.597
Well, we'll see what happens!

00:41:12.217 --> 00:41:16.600
And then we're also gonna be playing Aquarium later on Sunday evening.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.801
So please join us!

00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:24.524
Aquarium is Aqua-senpai's visual novel, so we're gonna enjoy it all together, Ruffians!
