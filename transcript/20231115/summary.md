## Marine 4th Anniversary Concert (8:02)

hololive's captain [Houshou Marine](https://www.youtube.com/@HoushouMarine) celebrated her 4th Anniversary with a [small concert](https://youtu.be/Nuy3XE8vjgc), 70's style.

## New Song "SHINKIRO" (9:56)

Marine also revealed her MV for her new original song ["SHINKIRO"](https://youtu.be/9ehwhQJ50gs), a colaboration with [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/@GawrGura) from hololive English -Myth-. A city pop song with nostalgic vibes. Check it out!

## Nerissa's Birthday (11:06)

[Nerissa Ravencroft](https://www.youtube.com/@NerissaRavencroft) from hololive English -Advent- is celebrating her birthday on November 21st! Mococo seems adamant about the idea of sharing her tummy with her (or Fuwawa) as a gift...

## Misunderstanding (14:09)

Today's misunderstanding that broke their no-misunderstanding streak comes from their [Fashion Dreamer stream](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=1293), when Fuwawa said: "if you massage this, it will be bigger"; Moco-chan had to clarify she meant "the eyes".

## Monitor issues (17:26)

Also from their Fashion Dreamer stream: Mococo is concerned that Fuwawa just [CAN'T](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=3830s). [STOP](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=4704). [TOUCHING](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=7800). [THE](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=10360). [MONITOR](https://youtu.be/IkKoOPXcI8Q?t=10568), and she might just break the screen at some point.

## Incident (19:57)

Just before their [Metal Gear Solid stream](https://youtu.be/KarLzbs9N5Y), FUWAMOCO discovered that their PS2 Memory Card was incompatible with PS1 games, meaning that they wouldn't be able to save. Papapuppy brought them a PS1 Memory Card mid-stream! Alas, it was full already, and the PS2 refused to recognize it to delete save blocks and make space for new saves. Unless they find a working memory card before their next PS2 stream, they'll lose their progress.

## Mococo Pup Talk (22:24)

Are your eyes open properly? After today's Mococo Pup Talk, they surely will!

## Doggie of the Day (24:39)

[Red Azteroid](https://twitter.com/RAzteroid/status/1723968530675278240) found FUWAMOCO themselves while on a hike! Or at least some cute dogs reminiscent of our demon guard dogs.

## Today I Went On A Walk (26:32)

[Harti](https://twitter.com/xalandr/status/1724061708921016711) found some cool-looking mushrooms while taking a a walk.

## Question Of The Day (27:54)

From [@antid0m0](https://twitter.com/antid0m0/status/1724274238029275229): do FUWAMOCO use their human ears to listen? Short answer: they're just decorative. Refer to [ep. 2](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=1573) for a different take on a similar question!

## Next Stream & Schedule (29:33)

No stream until next FWMC Morning. The girls will be working hard on their homework instead!

## Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians (32:10)
