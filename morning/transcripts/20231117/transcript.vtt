05:09.693 --> 05:11.935
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:12.355 --> 05:15.898
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:15.918 --> 05:18.681
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.701 --> 05:19.802
BAU!

05:19.822 --> 05:23.825
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.626 --> 05:27.608
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.968 --> 05:29.830
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.870 --> 05:29.990
BAU!

05:38.337 --> 05:42.658
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:42.678 --> 05:44.278
Ruffians!

05:44.878 --> 05:46.218
BAU BAU!

05:46.238 --> 05:54.320
Thank you for waking up early and joining us today for our 45th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:54.340 --> 05:56.920
BAU BAU!

05:59.241 --> 06:00.201
Is it loud today?

06:01.201 --> 06:01.761
Loud?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.302
It sounds different!

06:06.882 --> 06:07.602
That's weird.

06:12.008 --> 06:13.609
This is us for today, okay?

06:14.369 --> 06:16.250
Can you hear us, Ruffians?

06:16.391 --> 06:17.351
It's a bit loud.

06:17.371 --> 06:19.632
Loud puppies.

06:19.652 --> 06:24.895
This is us for today!

06:24.915 --> 06:27.677
BAU BAU!

06:27.717 --> 06:37.623
Well, for Ruffians joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:38.827 --> 06:39.087
A.k.a.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.028
FUWAMOCO!

06:40.208 --> 06:42.210
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:42.230 --> 06:44.272
That means you can hear us write.

06:44.892 --> 06:45.713
Can you hear us?

06:47.755 --> 06:53.119
I aim to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.364
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:58.924 --> 07:02.627
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:02.707 --> 07:04.169
BAU BAU!

07:04.269 --> 07:05.370
Loud and clear.

07:08.564 --> 07:20.154
We didn't change anything, but... This is how it is today!

07:21.315 --> 07:23.176
It's just a bit louder FUWAMOCO Morning.

07:23.196 --> 07:27.199
Moco-chan!

07:28.180 --> 07:31.023
We had another Pero Sighting!

07:32.944 --> 07:33.625
How are things going?

07:51.957 --> 07:56.778
Maybe we're okay without him.

07:56.798 --> 07:57.658
Maybe it's okay.

08:20.714 --> 08:23.475
BAU BAU!

08:23.495 --> 08:24.796
BAU BAU!

08:24.836 --> 08:29.978
Let's not worry too much.

08:30.178 --> 08:31.959
Let's not worry about stuff, okay?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.561
On happier news, have you heard, Ruffians?

08:35.881 --> 08:37.682
Did you hear?

08:38.622 --> 08:39.182
Do you know?

08:40.403 --> 08:46.886
Right now hololive has an official shop for a limited time in Tokyo Station!

08:53.118 --> 08:54.118
You know what that means?

08:55.379 --> 08:59.022
You can get your merch now whenever you want if you're in Japan!

08:59.202 --> 09:07.587
You can touch the merch and look at it until your heart's content before deciding to welcome it into your home, you know it!

09:07.627 --> 09:13.611
The shop opened the other day on the 16th, and it will be there until January 18th.

09:14.312 --> 09:19.855
It's located in the basement floor of Tokyo Station, and it's part of the Tokyo Character Street.

09:20.996 --> 09:21.276
I'm not.

09:37.625 --> 09:49.272
You can also find our senpai and Tokyo Tourism Ambassador Nekocchi-senpai, Calli-senpai, and Gura-senpai greeting you there with new goodies too!

09:49.632 --> 09:54.595
And of course as well as our other senpai you know much from other hololive members too!

09:56.796 --> 10:02.322
Advent, you know, we're still just newbies, so you won't be able to find us there this time.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.224
But we're on the screen, okay?

10:04.584 --> 10:06.647
We look forward to when we're included there too.

10:06.667 --> 10:10.290
Please go and take a look if you're in Japan!

10:10.691 --> 10:14.575
BAU BAU!

10:15.996 --> 10:17.778
But, that's not all.

10:19.660 --> 10:24.681
If you're not able to find us at Tokyo Station, this weekend!

10:24.861 --> 10:32.043
There's definitely one place you'll be able to find us, and that place is... New York City!

10:32.103 --> 10:34.023
BAU BAU!

10:34.123 --> 10:34.723
BAU BAU!

10:35.223 --> 10:39.844
Yes, we'll be making an appearance as guests at Anime New York City this weekend.

10:40.204 --> 10:43.625
I'll be holding a panel together with all of Advent on Saturday.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.428
And we really can't wait to see all the Adventrix will be there.

10:48.448 --> 10:48.708
Right!

10:48.728 --> 10:53.691
We just finished the rehearsal for it and we're very very excited.

10:54.311 --> 10:59.034
We'll also be making appearances at the hololive booth and the exhibitors hall throughout the weekend.

10:59.214 --> 11:06.659
And today, Shiori, Bijou, and Nerissa will be making an appearance there at 3pm EST.

11:06.759 --> 11:08.840
So please don't miss them, okay?

11:09.901 --> 11:13.082
We'll also be holding a Rock n' Rawr Party Mini!

11:13.362 --> 11:16.663
And a Q&A session there this weekend too!

11:18.043 --> 11:23.965
We wanted to be able to make the most of this opportunity, so that's why we're doing two different appearances as well.

11:24.025 --> 11:32.927
We're really happy, but Ruffians, we're really excited to be able to see and to hear you cheering for us!

11:33.247 --> 11:36.828
But, for the Q&A, please remember, okay?

11:37.864 --> 11:41.746
Demon guard dogs are really good at remembering faces.

11:43.326 --> 11:43.666
Got it.

11:44.707 --> 11:48.869
So think carefully before you ask any silly questions, okay Ruffians?

11:50.129 --> 11:51.310
Not that you know that.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.370
It's not a threat.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.531
Because Ruffians are so well behaved.

11:55.692 --> 11:57.052
Yeah, it's not a threat.

11:58.353 --> 11:59.893
Got it!

11:59.953 --> 12:00.694
BAU BAU!

12:02.076 --> 12:03.576
But that's not it!

12:03.596 --> 12:10.598
Advent will also have some very special merch on sale at Anime NYC too!

12:10.658 --> 12:12.998
A special t-shirt and a folding fan!

12:13.979 --> 12:19.420
You know, it could come in handy, especially if you're looking to make friends with other Ruffians and ventrix!

12:20.740 --> 12:27.782
And you know, it also makes it easier to spot in the crowd these other t-shirts, like you know, the Halloween t-shirt too!

12:28.802 --> 12:29.483
BAU BAU!

13:01.263 --> 13:03.904
So much excitement!

13:03.984 --> 13:05.085
Ruffians!

13:07.045 --> 13:17.409
But... You know... Excitement... It sorta stops there.

13:17.429 --> 13:17.489
Why?

13:19.630 --> 13:20.490
It's Friday.

13:20.510 --> 13:24.252
There's another misunderstanding.

13:26.173 --> 13:26.993
Cuz you know it.

13:28.260 --> 13:29.040
Ruffians!

13:30.741 --> 13:32.062
I have something to say.

13:32.082 --> 13:40.826
It's not a confession or anything, but I feel like you might be misunderstanding something.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.608
You're not misunderstanding anything, right?

13:45.169 --> 13:46.509
I'm just being silly, right?

13:49.471 --> 13:49.691
No.

13:50.932 --> 13:54.934
You realize that Fuwawa and I, we're twins, right?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.145
Identical twins.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.526
And you know what identical means?

14:00.026 --> 14:01.187
It means the same!

14:02.307 --> 14:02.667
Yeah.

14:03.068 --> 14:03.908
Not fraternal.

14:03.988 --> 14:04.788
Not fraternal.

14:04.828 --> 14:05.469
Got that.

14:06.569 --> 14:06.749
No.

14:07.350 --> 14:13.813
I see a lot of Ruffians saying that Fuwawa is bigger than I. What do you mean?

14:16.434 --> 14:17.375
You have eyes!

14:22.537 --> 14:23.818
You watched their debut, right?

14:25.139 --> 14:25.519
Right!

14:26.789 --> 14:29.051
You looked at our official profiles, right?

14:30.353 --> 14:32.215
You should know the proper info by now.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.598
It's been more than a hundred days, okay?

14:36.539 --> 14:40.964
You know, we're the exact same height, okay?

14:41.044 --> 14:41.445
Got it.

14:41.985 --> 14:44.368
We're both 155 centimeters.

14:47.583 --> 14:51.584
5 feet, 1 inches, 155 centimeters.

14:52.745 --> 14:57.366
The only big difference is our eye color and our ears and tails.

14:57.386 --> 14:58.486
I guess they're a bit different.

15:00.007 --> 15:01.247
But we're identical!

15:02.808 --> 15:06.649
So, why do I keep on seeing you say weird things like that?

15:06.709 --> 15:07.149
Hi!

15:07.869 --> 15:09.410
D-d-different weight?

15:13.051 --> 15:13.591
You got it.

15:16.084 --> 15:19.625
Because if you think otherwise, you need to check your facts, okay?

15:20.525 --> 15:21.005
Got it.

15:22.326 --> 15:24.346
I don't want to see anything weird from now on.

15:25.987 --> 15:27.167
No misunderstandings.

15:28.608 --> 15:29.828
Use your brain, okay?

15:30.348 --> 15:30.748
Yeah!

15:31.188 --> 15:32.769
Use your brain, okay?

15:32.809 --> 15:33.209
Got it.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.729
No misunderstandings.

15:39.691 --> 15:41.851
How could they think that we're not twins?

15:41.892 --> 15:42.432
That we're not...

15:44.248 --> 15:44.448
What?

15:44.508 --> 15:46.729
What are you saying?

15:46.909 --> 15:50.031
Why are you gonna make the misunderstanding worse?

15:53.092 --> 15:55.053
BAU BAU!

15:55.553 --> 15:55.993
Got it.

15:58.174 --> 15:58.734
BAU BAU.

16:02.916 --> 16:03.977
Well, Ruffians.

16:05.317 --> 16:06.258
We sure that...

16:07.549 --> 16:08.230
I wonder why.

16:29.612 --> 16:30.533
Good news!

16:30.954 --> 16:36.058
We're able to go memory card hunting with Mama Puppy the day afterwards.

16:36.639 --> 16:46.789
Not only did we just get one PS1 memory card, but we actually got two of them and an extra PS2 memory card too!

16:46.869 --> 16:47.870
BAU BAU!

16:49.011 --> 16:52.214
And you know, an even better news!

16:53.387 --> 16:58.510
We kept the PS2 running, so we just shoved the PS1 memory card in!

16:59.130 --> 17:01.352
And then we phoned Meiling, and guess what?

17:03.385 --> 17:05.007
She let us save!

17:05.027 --> 17:06.728
No issues!

17:06.748 --> 17:08.430
She even congratulated us.

17:08.950 --> 17:09.611
Very kind.

17:10.332 --> 17:12.774
So we're happy!

17:12.834 --> 17:18.580
From now, nothing will get in the way of our MGS journey!

17:19.661 --> 17:22.764
Let's continue on our mission as Solid Snake O'K!

17:22.904 --> 17:25.546
BAU BAU!

17:27.255 --> 17:28.156
I'm excited.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.837
All's good that ends... It's not ended!

17:30.857 --> 17:32.277
It continues.

17:32.838 --> 17:33.258
All's good.

17:33.278 --> 17:33.498
All's good!

17:33.798 --> 17:34.058
Yes!

17:34.658 --> 17:35.979
All is good!

17:36.819 --> 17:39.500
BAU BAU!

17:40.281 --> 17:41.281
Hello fans.

17:43.422 --> 17:46.823
We have some happiness, but... How are you doing?

17:46.863 --> 17:47.824
How are you doing?

17:47.844 --> 17:50.205
Are you doing good?

17:50.685 --> 17:55.067
You know, yesterday was our first full day when we weren't live anywhere.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.741
What did you think, Moco-chan?

17:58.962 --> 18:00.883
It was... sort of weird.

18:01.904 --> 18:02.264
But!

18:03.565 --> 18:03.965
But!

18:05.066 --> 18:07.948
We did get a lot of homework done.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.409
Yeah, we did!

18:10.390 --> 18:13.172
But... There's still more to get done.

18:15.353 --> 18:18.595
At the very least, Mayuri-chan shouldn't have any more tears.

18:19.436 --> 18:19.836
For now.

18:21.057 --> 18:21.477
For now.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.956
There's still a lot of things that we need to get done and done pretty quickly!

18:26.976 --> 18:28.477
Yeah!

18:29.357 --> 18:35.840
You know, the end of the year is quickly approaching and everything, so... That's us.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.801
That's us.

18:37.821 --> 18:38.481
Happy!

18:39.321 --> 18:39.861
Homework!

18:40.482 --> 18:41.022
Done!

18:41.962 --> 18:48.965
But... Yeah... You know... If we want to be able to get some of the things...

18:49.787 --> 18:51.511
We gotta hurry up our paws a little bit!

18:51.531 --> 18:54.178
Otherwise, you know, FUWAMOCO will be kind of...

19:00.828 --> 19:02.269
Disappointed.

19:02.369 --> 19:02.949
Grumpy.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.490
Disappointed.

19:04.550 --> 19:04.930
Yes!

19:06.171 --> 19:08.413
You know, so we need to hurry up!

19:08.893 --> 19:16.658
But you know, we did get one good sleep and a walk in Florence, so that's helpful.

19:16.898 --> 19:18.439
BAU BAU!

19:18.619 --> 19:20.180
We'll continue working hard, okay?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.241
We'll do our best, okay, Ruffians?

19:22.281 --> 19:22.561
Yeah!

19:23.662 --> 19:25.123
BAU BAU!

19:25.983 --> 19:27.144
BAU BAU!

19:27.164 --> 19:28.825
We went on a walkie-talkie.

19:28.845 --> 19:30.386
We realized something.

19:31.489 --> 19:37.572
Ruffians, has it maybe gotten a little bit chillier where you are?

19:38.372 --> 19:39.633
Maybe just a bit.

19:40.273 --> 19:41.414
A bit cold?

19:43.035 --> 19:49.918
Well, in the Northwest Passage, it now is completely feeling like winter outside.

19:52.230 --> 19:58.274
In other words, it's now the season of FUWAMOCO!

19:58.515 --> 20:06.160
You need your fluffy, fluffy, your fluffy clothing, your fuzzy clothing to keep you warm, okay?

20:06.260 --> 20:07.841
Are you ready?

20:07.861 --> 20:12.104
Do you have your FUWAMOCO pajamas to keep you cozy at night?

20:12.605 --> 20:13.846
Your FUWAMOCO scarf?

20:14.226 --> 20:15.407
FUWAMOCO gloves?

20:17.128 --> 20:21.812
Please make sure you stay warm out in the elements so that you stay healthy, okay?

20:21.852 --> 20:25.134
It's because FUWAMOCO is like fluffy.

20:25.154 --> 20:26.375
Fluffy and fuzzy.

20:26.395 --> 20:27.536
Fluffy and fuzzy, right.

20:27.636 --> 20:29.157
FUWAMOCO keeps you warm.

20:30.198 --> 20:33.320
It's FUWAMOCO pajamas in Japanese.

20:34.941 --> 20:36.242
Yeah!

20:36.642 --> 20:48.368
But you know, as FUWAMOCO, FUWAMOCO is FUWAMOCO and we're pretty fluffy and fuzzy, but we're still making sure to bundle up too when we go for walks, so... You don't forget, okay?

20:48.408 --> 20:49.069
No forgetting!

20:49.149 --> 20:49.849
Okay, got it!

20:49.869 --> 20:51.730
It's cold.

20:51.930 --> 20:52.431
It's cold.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.332
BAU BAU!

20:54.352 --> 20:55.672
BAU BAU!

20:55.692 --> 20:59.314
1, 2, or... Doggie of the Day!

20:59.614 --> 21:01.575
It's the time of the day!

21:04.946 --> 21:06.407
What do we have for today?

21:06.427 --> 21:09.810
We have... The Dead Taco!

21:09.870 --> 21:10.631
Taco!

21:10.831 --> 21:13.373
It's a Doggie of the Day!

21:13.393 --> 21:15.074
Very cute!

21:18.351 --> 21:22.615
Oh, and he really likes a good kitty.

21:22.936 --> 21:26.539
I love the moo-moo nose.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.342
Except in cats, even though the cat doesn't like it.

21:29.362 --> 21:30.623
Sounds familiar.

21:30.643 --> 21:36.709
You can barely see, but Tako has a very good hold on that kitty too.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.771
Yeah, that's exactly how you do it.

21:41.907 --> 21:43.008
Taco's such a cutie.

21:43.028 --> 21:44.768
This is a heartwarming picture too.

21:44.788 --> 21:46.309
A big heartwarming picture.

21:46.509 --> 21:48.229
It gives us energy.

21:49.369 --> 21:51.510
But how does Taco BAU BAU?

21:52.010 --> 21:55.491
You know, maybe like when they're huffing cats?

21:55.611 --> 21:56.371
BAU BAU!

21:56.391 --> 21:58.852
BAU BAU!

21:58.912 --> 22:00.072
BAU BAU!

22:00.112 --> 22:00.913
BAU BAU!

22:06.267 --> 22:07.448
Something like that.

22:08.729 --> 22:09.630
Shiori!

22:09.931 --> 22:12.453
No, this is Tako, not Shiori!

22:12.573 --> 22:14.355
Tako has a moo-moo nose.

22:14.395 --> 22:16.777
Shiori does not have a moo-moo nose.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.200
Sometimes we call her a cow, but she doesn't have a moo-moo nose.

22:22.129 --> 22:25.531
But, ah, ah, Tako, I don't know.

22:25.772 --> 22:35.918
We're not teaching about Tako's name since we've never had a Tako before, but if Tako are as good as Tako is cute, then I think I like them.

22:36.358 --> 22:40.441
But we can tell that from the wonderful smile Tako has, you know?

22:41.326 --> 22:41.806
BAU BAU!

22:59.595 --> 23:04.017
And next we have... Today I went for a walk!

23:04.437 --> 23:05.858
Where did this Ruffian go?

23:05.878 --> 23:08.819
Let's see... De-den!

23:13.341 --> 23:15.022
Such a pink skirt!

23:15.102 --> 23:16.722
It's fluffy and fuzzy too!

23:16.742 --> 23:17.003
Right?

23:17.183 --> 23:19.644
But... I think it's fuzzy.

23:20.364 --> 23:20.964
It's pink!

23:21.244 --> 23:21.945
It's fuzzy!

23:22.145 --> 23:23.665
It's... It's me!

23:23.786 --> 23:25.186
Mococo!

23:26.807 --> 23:27.127
Got it.

23:28.154 --> 23:29.516
You went for a Mococo walk.

23:31.918 --> 23:32.499
Okay.

23:32.639 --> 23:35.322
Thank you for sharing your walk with us!

23:35.883 --> 23:38.025
BAU BAU!

23:39.146 --> 23:44.693
And for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

23:46.034 --> 23:47.696
So far, you have only

23:48.116 --> 23:49.497
Good question, huh?

23:49.517 --> 23:52.318
Not even a Rock n' Rawr Party have we done a solo, right?

24:16.090 --> 24:18.993
Well, I don't think there's really that deep of a reason or anything.

24:19.013 --> 24:25.359
It's just, we enjoy singing on our own too, but we like how our voices harmonize and complement each other.

24:25.419 --> 24:33.286
Right, yeah, but... You know, we're really happy, but we also really like you to cheer for us together as a unit too.

24:33.567 --> 24:34.427
Right?

24:34.447 --> 24:36.609
But... Maybe...

24:37.819 --> 24:45.926
Just maybe... There might be something interesting coming up, but... Just maybe... Maybe.

24:46.267 --> 24:46.967
Both are good.

24:47.368 --> 24:48.188
Together are good.

24:48.629 --> 24:49.249
Exactly!

24:49.450 --> 24:50.090
Exactly.

24:50.190 --> 24:51.632
Thank you, Ruffians.

24:51.772 --> 24:53.593
We hope you're excited for everything.

24:53.653 --> 24:53.833
Yeah!

24:54.674 --> 24:59.656
I also want to say a big thank you for all your submissions today, Ruffians!

24:59.977 --> 25:05.219
Please don't forget, don't ever forget, that FUWAMOCO Morning is a show we make together.

25:05.259 --> 25:05.679
Together!

25:05.719 --> 25:06.680
We need you here.

25:06.760 --> 25:11.522
Your submissions to be able to make FUWAMOCO Morning the thing it is.

25:12.082 --> 25:13.083
So thank you!

25:13.143 --> 25:13.723
Thank you!

25:13.763 --> 25:14.403
BAU BAU!

25:14.463 --> 25:15.964
BAU BAU!

25:16.744 --> 25:19.946
And next, we have our next stream coming up.

25:20.026 --> 25:21.927
Our next stream is... Only a few hours.

25:23.323 --> 25:24.744
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:24.784 --> 25:26.645
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

25:26.965 --> 25:27.285
BAU BAU!

25:27.405 --> 25:30.306
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:51.536 --> 25:53.298
More information coming very soon!

26:06.733 --> 26:08.094
BAU BAU!

26:08.734 --> 26:10.534
And our schedule!

26:10.774 --> 26:12.675
We have much!

26:12.755 --> 26:14.916
This weekend is Anime NYC!

26:15.016 --> 26:21.418
But on Saturday, like always, we'll be holding our FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

26:21.698 --> 26:27.540
And this time, yeah, we're doing another hololive only thing!

26:27.640 --> 26:27.880
Yeah!

26:27.940 --> 26:30.121
We're gonna be singing our senpai songs!

26:30.221 --> 26:32.381
So we hope that you'll be there.

26:32.401 --> 26:33.402
We'll do our best to...

26:35.336 --> 26:38.919
Properly pay respect.

26:39.399 --> 26:40.761
Just a bit nervous.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.663
But we'll do it the FUWAMOCO way, right?

26:43.683 --> 26:44.704
FUWAMOCO version.

26:44.744 --> 26:45.645
Have lots of fun.

26:45.665 --> 26:48.087
Please join us, okay Ruffians?

26:48.127 --> 26:49.368
Let's have fun, okay?

26:52.250 --> 26:58.671
Wow, now the week's coming to a close, but the weekend's just getting started!

26:58.731 --> 27:00.271
It's just around the corner, okay!

27:00.331 --> 27:05.332
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:05.732 --> 27:08.513
And for joining us this entire week, too!

27:08.873 --> 27:15.514
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

27:16.114 --> 27:16.994

27:17.194 --> 27:18.635

27:23.316 --> 27:24.757

Decorative Cake.

27:27.099 --> 27:28.240
BAU BAU!

27:28.260 --> 27:28.300
MP509.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.080
BAU BAU!

27:29.140 --> 27:29.461
Tencho.

27:29.541 --> 27:30.121
BAU BAU!

27:30.201 --> 27:30.561
Hawkmoon.

27:30.782 --> 27:31.742
BAU BAU!

27:37.986 --> 27:49.173
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

27:49.193 --> 27:51.455
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:51.515 --> 27:52.135
BAU BAU!
