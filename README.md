# üêæ FUWAMOCO Transcripts Repository

This repo contains scripts to generate automatic transcriptions, as well as summaries, for [FUWAMOCO](https://www.youtube.com/@FUWAMOCOch) content, starting with FWMC Morning.

This is a fan made project. The contents in this repository follow the [hololive production Derivative Works Guidelines](https://hololivepro.com/en/terms/) set forth by Cover Corp.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Building

Some of the files here are generated automatically.

1. Media is extracted directly from YouTube along with its metadata. Audio is converted into .wav format for easier processing.
1. Audio is automatically transcribed using a mix of automatic speech recognition plus some manual workarounds to provide the most accurate transcript possible from the get-go.
1. A basic summary is created. A LLM/RAG tool can be leveraged to summarize the information from the transcript and help with the initial draft.
1. Using the basic summary and metadata from each media, a fancier summary document can be created programmatically.
1. An index of all summaries can be automatically generated.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- Optional: [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) to handle virtual Python environments.
- Otherwise, make sure that Python 3.12 is installed.

If using Windows, you can install all these prerequisites with [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/).

## üî∞ Quick start

### Install prerequisites in Windows

[Make sure that WinGet is installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/), then run the following:

```text
winget install Oven-sh.Bun
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
winget install CondaForge.Miniforge3
```

### Install prerequisites in Linux

WhisperX requires Python 3.12. Make sure that such version is installed on your system before creating an environment.

You can install Bun or Node.js from your distro package manager, or directly by following the instructions on the [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation#macos-and-linux) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) download websites.

### Set up Miniconda environment

1. If using PowerShell, init Miniconda: `conda init powershell`
1. Create environment with some base packages: `conda env create --file environment.yml`
1. Activate environment: `conda activate transcripts`
1. Proceed with WhisperX installation.

### Set up venv

1. Create environment: `python3.12 -m venv transcripts`
1. Activate environment:
    - PowerShell: `.\transcripts\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    - Bash: `source ./transcripts/bin/activate`
1. Install base packages: `pip install -r requirements_0_base.txt`
1. Proceed with installation of other packages.

### Install WhisperX

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements_1_torch_cu129.txt` (use `requirements_1_torch_cpu_<platform>.txt` instead if you don't have an Nvidia GPU)
1. Install WhisperX: `pip install -r requirements_2_whisperx.txt`
1. On Linux, if you encounter an error similar to `ImportError: libctranslate2-d3638643.so.4.4.0: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires`, run `./workaround_libctranslate2_clear-execstack.sh` to clear conflicting `GNU_STACK` executable flag from the library; see <https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/issues/1849>.
1. On Linux, if you encounter an error similar to `Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`, downgrade Torch: `pip install -r requirements_1_torch_cu118.txt`; see <https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/issues/967>. Ignore any dependency conflicts coming from WhisperX.
