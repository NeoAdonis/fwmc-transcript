00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:18.178
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:21.721
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:23.242
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:27.866
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:28.406
BAU BAU!

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:30.127
BAU BAU!

00:05:30.147 --> 00:05:34.171
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:36.132
Thank you for joining us!

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:41.020
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.064
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:45.124 --> 00:05:49.247
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:52.209
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:00.016
And we're excited to be here, Ruffians!

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:01.757
Well, just like...

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:10.522
Every FUWAMOCO Morning, today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:17.045
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today on only our 55th episode!

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:18.346
That's so weird.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:22.768
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.529
It's weird, but thank you!

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.671
It's been 55 episodes, but maybe, you know, there's still some Ruffians

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:32.296
If you aren't quite sure what FUWAMOCO Morning is, it can be confusing.

00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:39.240
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.101
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.083
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:44.563 --> 00:06:50.608
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:56.793
Please tweet your thoughts using the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:57.173 --> 00:07:00.776
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:04.999
BAU BAU!

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.001
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:09.403
Are you ready to start your new week today?

00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:10.938
Huh?

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.120
Moco-chan, I think we are too, right?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.580
Hopefully.

00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:16.042
Hopefully!

00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:17.863
Why?

00:07:18.503 --> 00:07:22.406
Well, I think there was a Ruffian that had a Pero Sighting.

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:26.509
Well, where was Pero this time?

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:27.389
Let's see.

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:29.891
De-den!

00:07:30.872 --> 00:07:30.972
Oh.

00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:31.592
Oh.

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:37.345
Are you feeling alright?

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:41.589
Maybe your head is hurting a bit.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.072
You wear glasses.

00:07:44.813 --> 00:07:46.274
Is the prescription okay?

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:53.881
Yeah, well, maybe you should go lay down or something.

00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:57.105
You know, that's a lot of pero you're seeing there.

00:07:58.206 --> 00:07:59.748
That's not right, okay?

00:07:59.768 --> 00:08:06.318
There's only one Pero, and even at that, there's sometimes too many, okay?

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:08.842
And you know Pero is Pero.

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:12.166
He's not the sun, the sky, or the grass.

00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:15.491
But thank goodness for that, right?

00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:19.116
The sun is the sun, the grass is the grass, the sky is the sky.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:19.997
Not Peron.

00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:20.958
Yeah.

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:25.584
But, you know, we know things might have been tough recently.

00:08:25.664 --> 00:08:28.208
You know, it's the end of the year and everything.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:28.728
Yeah.

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:29.950
It's rough, right?

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.451
It's rough.

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:40.053
There might be a lot of stress and pressure on you two, but maybe it's time to have a little rest and then try again in a bit.

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:41.494
Yeah, rest is good.

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:44.855
Take it easy, okay?

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:45.615
Got it.

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:46.635
Got it.

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.316
Take it easy, okay?

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:51.796
BAU BAU!

00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:56.678
BAU BAU.

00:08:58.462 --> 00:08:58.783
But!

00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:01.107
Hopefully everything's a little bit better.

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:01.667
It'll be okay.

00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:03.090
It's good, it's colorful.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.731
A colorful world.

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.374
Colorful is good, I guess.

00:09:05.974 --> 00:09:07.878
But more happily!

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.039
More excitingly!

00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:10.702
Ruffians.

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:15.628
On Friday, we had a big collab with Advent.

00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:17.370
We played Play-Doh, right?

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.171
Play-Doh!

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:18.812
Play-Doh!

00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:25.919
But then, we shared our biggest announcement of the year so far!

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:31.805
On January 1st, Advent will be revealing our New Year outfit!

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:37.335
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:38.676
Exciting!

00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:40.977
A new outfit for FUWAMOCO!

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:45.339
Our first new outfit!

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.240
How excited are you, Ruffians?

00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:53.103
Excited!

00:09:53.943 --> 00:10:00.046
I don't know if you can be more excited than we are, but... Extremely excited!

00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:02.285
Achoo!

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:04.666
I don't know, the Ruffians.

00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:08.367
What do you think they'll look like just looking at the silhouettes?

00:10:08.787 --> 00:10:14.789
You know, maybe you see some paw-like shapes, maybe.

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:18.910
Maybe Fuwawa has a ponytail, maybe.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.450
I'm sure that's what that is.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:26.872
And me, I'm looking not just fuzzy, but a little curly, too.

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:28.673
Curly, yeah.

00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:35.332
Do you think that's maybe a fun ring in our hair, too?

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:39.773
Could be, but maybe not.

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:41.013
What else?

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:42.854
What else could it be, Ruffians?

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.854
It is!

00:10:47.775 --> 00:10:50.075
OMG, it is!

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:51.555
It is!

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:52.696
Oh my gosh!

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:53.136
What?

00:10:56.326 --> 00:11:02.397
Ruffians, you have to join us to find out, but we want to make sure.

00:11:02.657 --> 00:11:03.999
Please don't die, okay?

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.832
You have to make sure that your heart will withstand it, okay?

00:11:10.332 --> 00:11:12.653
Please let us know what you think the look like though, okay?

00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:14.154
Use the hashtag!

00:11:14.555 --> 00:11:15.135
Hashtag!

00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:19.277
FWMCNEWYEAR!

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:27.702
We hope that you'll be there for us on January 1st at 6.30pm PT or 11.30am JST.

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:32.385
BAU BAU!

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:33.766
And just to let you know,

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:36.740
All the other Advent girls' outfits.

00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:45.166
They're killer too.

00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:48.549
Don't miss it, okay?

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:51.351
BAU BAU!

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.994
Well, speaking of outfits, Moco-chan.

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:58.216
Not just New Year outfits.

00:11:58.497 --> 00:11:59.998
Ruffians!

00:12:01.226 --> 00:12:07.469
Did you see the photo that Icomochi-mama took of me?

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:16.153
It's embarrassing, but it seems like you really liked it, so I posted it to Twitter!

00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:16.953
Did you see it?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.992
Hi!

00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:34.957
You know, a lot of people seem to think that Fuwawa posted it, or something, like she made me do it, but... I didn't do anything like that one time.

00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:40.120
Okay, don't think that everything on Twitter is done all by Fuwawa, because it's not!

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.782
You know, I don't even know why you think that, but... The silly things are always Moco-chan.

00:12:44.842 --> 00:12:45.182
What?

00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:48.181
Hi.

00:12:48.442 --> 00:12:48.862
What?

00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:51.164
I did the best pose I could.

00:12:51.284 --> 00:12:51.625
Okay.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:52.886
What do you think?

00:12:54.287 --> 00:12:55.729
Do I make a good pose?

00:12:55.749 --> 00:12:55.889
Cute!

00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:56.950
Subarashii!

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.111
Kawaii!

00:12:58.551 --> 00:12:59.312
Tasukaru!

00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:01.254
Praise!

00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:04.617
Praise me, Ruffians!

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:05.078
It's cute!

00:13:05.138 --> 00:13:07.000
Kawaii?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.480
Kawaii!

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.318
ASMR Icomochi-mama so talented!

00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.003
We want to know more about what you like, Ruffians.

00:13:25.144 --> 00:13:30.289
If you haven't checked out Icomochi-mama's Twitter yet, please do, okay?

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:35.273
We have the best mama in the whole wide world!

00:13:35.374 --> 00:13:37.496
Icomochi-mama!

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:42.340
And you know, even Fuana-senpai likes to retweet at me, too.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.142
What do you think that means, Moco-chan?

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.534
I like Bona-senpai too.

00:13:47.854 --> 00:13:53.617
Maybe that means she likes the Mocopony too.

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:00.882
BAU BAU!

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.464
Bona has good taste too.

00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:06.585
I like Bona-senpai.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.806
But I like Oda-senpai of course.

00:14:11.843 --> 00:14:18.772
As you might know, yesterday was a very important homework day for FUWAMOCO.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.491
Do you know why we're Ruffians?

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:57.327
We want to say thank you!

00:14:57.807 --> 00:14:58.788
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:14:58.828 --> 00:15:01.109
We couldn't have done it without you.

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:10.913
But, well, you know, Moco-chan gets really scared of updates and changes, so naturally, we avoided them at all costs.

00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:16.536
You know, and we were having some issues that prevented us from doing because

00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:20.377
You know, our situation is a bit different, okay?

00:15:20.757 --> 00:15:22.097
There's two of us.

00:15:22.937 --> 00:15:30.779
But you know, finally, we made a big jump to a bunch of new software as well as some big hardware updates.

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:34.320
There were a ton of bumps though.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.241
Watch screen monitor?

00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:38.941
No.

00:15:39.002 --> 00:15:39.322
No.

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:40.282
No.

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:42.802
That would be nice though!

00:15:42.822 --> 00:15:43.223
Two PC?

00:15:43.263 --> 00:15:43.363
No.

00:15:43.423 --> 00:15:43.463
No.

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:54.733
But, you know, for some reason, if we put our computer to sleep now, sometimes it doesn't want to wake up.

00:15:55.674 --> 00:16:01.919
You know, I sort of understand that feeling, but every time it happens, we have a bit of a heart attack.

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:05.002
Yeah, but it'll be okay!

00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:07.924
Yeah, we'll figure out all the new quirks for sure.

00:16:07.984 --> 00:16:09.606
We'll figure it out.

00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:12.867
You know, things aren't perfect.

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:17.248
Now some things look kind of fuzzy instead of crisp.

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:20.710
You know, fuzzy is good too!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.270
Sometimes you want things crisp.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.871
You don't want to have a fuzzy apple.

00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:26.071
You want to have a crisp apple pie.

00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:29.032
We can do some new cool things now!

00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:31.433
So... That's good.

00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:32.173
It's exciting.

00:16:32.193 --> 00:16:32.914
It's good.

00:16:32.954 --> 00:16:34.494
We're really excited!

00:16:34.774 --> 00:16:37.095
But you know... The next thing is...

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.460
Soon.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:38.740
Ish.

00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:39.221
Soon.

00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:39.601
Maybe.

00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:39.841
Ish.

00:16:59.135 --> 00:17:00.416
BAU BAU!

00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:03.978
We worked hard.

00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:07.960
It was scary but I did it.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.081
That face is FUWAMOCO's reflection?

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:14.143
I'd say that's accurate.

00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:20.986
But with maybe a bit more... A bit more sweat marks on it.

00:17:21.126 --> 00:17:22.307
BAU BAU!

00:17:26.687 --> 00:17:30.769
Well, there's been some more happy news recently, Ruffians.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.332
Wow, we have a second scoop!

00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:39.875
Thank you, Ruffians, for your FUWAMOCO scoop!

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:44.837
We got a really, really good tip from a Ruffian.

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:54.403
Well, you know, last week was a very special anniversary for all of hololive Indonesia's second generation hololive!

00:17:57.528 --> 00:18:05.915
A big congratulations on your 3rd anniversary to Aoi-senpai, Anya-senpai, and Riri-senpai!

00:18:06.035 --> 00:18:15.682
To celebrate it, Ai-senpai released a new song called Slop by Step, which actually has dual audio in Japanese and Indonesian.

00:18:15.702 --> 00:18:16.583
That's pretty cool.

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:22.847
You know, it's always so amazing to us how many of our Airi-senpai can speak 3 languages.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.911
I'm just a bit jealous.

00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:28.752
I'm a bit envious, you know?

00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:31.393
They make it seem so easy.

00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:33.014
It's not easy.

00:18:33.034 --> 00:18:35.775
And dual audio too.

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:40.157
But you know the song is super catchy and really inspiring too.

00:18:40.177 --> 00:18:42.198
With a full 3D MV.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:45.140
So you definitely need to check it out if you haven't.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.901
You need to check it out, okay?

00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:51.083
You know, I still can't believe they're already celebrating their third anniversary.

00:18:52.739 --> 00:18:54.160
Time passes so fast.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:54.620
What?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.241
I think the Ruffians know that.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.622
BAU time.

00:18:57.682 --> 00:19:02.084
Ruffians, before we know it, it's gonna be our half anniversary soon, too.

00:19:02.444 --> 00:19:03.205
Really, really.

00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:06.247
Oh my gosh.

00:19:06.807 --> 00:19:09.408
But- But dog doesn't count, okay?

00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:09.929
What?

00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:11.570
Dog doesn't count.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.691
Dog doesn't- Because humans can't understand dog, okay?

00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:16.352
One, two, three.

00:19:16.692 --> 00:19:16.933
BAU.

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:18.814
BAU.

00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:19.234
What?

00:19:21.229 --> 00:19:30.253
Thank you so much for all our hololive ID senpais for being so wonderful to us and Advent!

00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:32.074
BAU BAU!

00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:40.018
Selamat Hari Anniversary!

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:40.598
BAU BAU!

00:19:40.878 --> 00:19:45.841
Think Moco-chan, in only about 3 years it'll be our 3rd anniversary too.

00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:47.341
In less than 3 years.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.234
Two years and some months.

00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:56.516
Almost done.

00:19:56.857 --> 00:19:57.197
But...

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.632
I guess no more time to be happy.

00:20:08.372 --> 00:20:12.134
We think there's maybe something we should talk about.

00:20:12.154 --> 00:20:18.076
Yeah, I think Ruffians, you might be misunderstanding something.

00:20:18.557 --> 00:20:21.718
Misunderstanding something.

00:20:21.778 --> 00:20:23.059
Misunderstanding something!

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:23.399
Hai.

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:26.860
Yeah, I'm concerned, you know.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.563
I think it'll be bad if all the Ruffians continue living their lives with this misunderstanding.

00:20:33.427 --> 00:20:34.908
You need to know, okay?

00:20:34.928 --> 00:20:35.488
The truth.

00:20:35.888 --> 00:20:36.468
Yeah.

00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:40.190
You can't have this wrong misperception.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.891
Wrong perception.

00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:43.512
Misperception.

00:20:43.532 --> 00:20:45.252
Is that how it goes?

00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:46.133
Misperception?

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.869
It's a misunderstanding!

00:20:52.270 --> 00:21:00.038
Ruffians, you know, every week on Mondays, which is yesterday, today, Moco-chan tries to eat natto, right?

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:00.779
I do my best.

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:01.760
Twice.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.861
Don't eat it twice.

00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:04.202
I made a misconception.

00:21:05.043 --> 00:21:06.304
Okay, misperception.

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:13.911
But, Ruffians, every time we make sure to thank the farmers in Tochigi Prefecture.

00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:14.652
We do!

00:21:15.212 --> 00:21:16.813
Even if we can't eat it the best.

00:21:17.254 --> 00:21:22.959
If you haven't heard of Tochigi before, it's a prefecture in Japan that's not too far from Tokyo.

00:21:22.999 --> 00:21:25.761
It's only about two hours by car.

00:21:26.382 --> 00:21:30.706
But... But... You know, Tochigi...

00:21:31.897 --> 00:21:33.819
It's not famous for its natto.

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:36.341
It's not a natto perfection.

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:37.002
Not at all.

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:42.127
No, we just say thank you to them because they make the natto that we're eating.

00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:44.289
It says made in Tochigi.

00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:48.473
But if anything, Tochigi is famous for its strawberries.

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:50.515
Strawberry.

00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:54.597
It's Japan's Ichigo Okoku.

00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:57.478
Strawberry kingdom.

00:21:57.978 --> 00:22:03.902
Because you know it's known for its special strawberry variant variety.

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.742
The Tochi Otome.

00:22:05.903 --> 00:22:10.785
It's very popular in Japan.

00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:11.545
Not natto.

00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:15.848
But Tochigi is also known for its gyoza and wagyu too.

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:22.331
Mito City in Ibaraki is said to be the birthplace of natto.

00:22:22.351 --> 00:22:26.533
So naturally, you know there's a lot of yummy natto made here.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:47.012
So, you know, maybe you're planning a trip to Japan sometime soon!

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:58.937
You could go and visit Tochigi and have some yummy strawberries, and then you could head over to Mito City in Ibaraki for some delicious natto too!

00:22:59.217 --> 00:23:03.099
Or you know, you could just stay in Tochigi for the strawberries!

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:05.060
And the Wagyu.

00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:07.302
And the Gyoza.

00:23:07.983 --> 00:23:11.687
Make sure to take the farmers to Hukui, okay, Ruffians?

00:23:11.847 --> 00:23:12.448
Do it for us.

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:15.711
BAU BAU!

00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:18.174
Does this count?

00:23:18.994 --> 00:23:24.020
Ruffians, I saw some of you being like, yes, the Tochigi, not the Tochigi, yes.

00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:27.524
You're misunderstanding.

00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:31.067
That's it for Natto for today.

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:31.127
No!

00:23:33.188 --> 00:23:33.708
No!

00:23:33.769 --> 00:23:39.693
Because today is Monday, which means a new week and a new challenge!

00:23:39.713 --> 00:23:47.598
So today, just like every week, Moco-chan's going to do her best to conquer her fear.

00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:49.359
It's not Ico Natto!

00:23:49.459 --> 00:23:53.262
I feel like it wasn't a fear, but maybe... Maybe...

00:23:54.457 --> 00:23:55.498
It's developing.

00:23:56.999 --> 00:24:03.023
Well, Moco-chan, you know we've been here for a while, so please show some good progress today, okay?

00:24:03.903 --> 00:24:05.604
I'm really gonna give it my best.

00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:08.266
I really, I do every time, but I really am.

00:24:08.286 --> 00:24:14.490
I don't know if I'm convinced, but for Ruffians that might not know, natto is a common breakfast food in Japan.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.551
It's made of fermented soybeans.

00:24:17.392 --> 00:24:23.216
And it's pretty sticky and slimy and kind of smelly sometimes, but

00:24:23.556 --> 00:24:25.376
It's really, really, really good for you.

00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:26.737
I eat it every day.

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:27.837
It's a super food!

00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:31.858
FUWAMOCO-chan, you need to eat it every day too.

00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:33.638
I'm going to eat this.

00:24:33.658 --> 00:24:35.798
The smell!

00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:40.439
It's not horrible, but it is strong.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.061
So when you feel a bit queasy, it may be a bit strong.

00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:47.841
Queasy?

00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:48.321
Queasy!

00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:50.681
FUWAMOCO-chan, you know what?

00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:50.801
Fuffy.

00:24:51.102 --> 00:24:51.822
Fuzzy.

00:24:52.222 --> 00:24:52.802
Queasy.

00:24:53.762 --> 00:24:55.843
I bought something special for you today.

00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:57.083
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, why?

00:24:57.103 --> 00:24:57.843
I thought you know.

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:01.064
What else is strong smelling that you could add to the nuts?

00:25:01.204 --> 00:25:01.824
No!

00:25:02.044 --> 00:25:02.324
No!

00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:04.405
I don't want more strong stuff!

00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:05.205
No!

00:25:05.365 --> 00:25:07.165
I bought some sesame oil.

00:25:07.185 --> 00:25:08.926
It'll be yummy.

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:09.606
Smell it, Moco-chan.

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:10.866
No, no, I don't want it.

00:25:10.906 --> 00:25:12.907
The oil is just gonna make it more sticky.

00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:13.267
No!

00:25:13.487 --> 00:25:13.807
No!

00:25:14.047 --> 00:25:14.227
No!

00:25:14.247 --> 00:25:16.268
Okay, I'm going to add it!

00:25:17.108 --> 00:25:17.268
Ooh!

00:25:17.588 --> 00:25:18.188
A lot came out.

00:25:18.908 --> 00:25:20.949
Okay.

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:22.149
Oh!

00:25:23.746 --> 00:25:25.007
No oil spills.

00:25:26.368 --> 00:25:28.911
Okay, now it's time to pop it on.

00:25:32.414 --> 00:25:33.134
Durian!

00:25:33.915 --> 00:25:35.636
Durian and natto oil.

00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:37.538
It smells so good!

00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:43.543
Oh, I think... I think Moco-chan will be able to do her best today.

00:25:43.904 --> 00:25:45.245
I do like sesame oil.

00:25:49.853 --> 00:25:51.255
It smells really good, Moco-chan.

00:25:51.395 --> 00:25:52.236
Okay, it's ready.

00:25:52.256 --> 00:25:54.699
I think actually that was the perfect amount.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.864
That was the perfect amount of sesame oil.

00:25:58.304 --> 00:25:59.446
Yeah.

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:00.807
It smells good, right?

00:26:01.689 --> 00:26:02.730
I can't smell it yet.

00:26:04.492 --> 00:26:06.275
It smells like sesame oil.

00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:11.341
It smells like sesame oil.

00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:13.982
Why are you making... I wear socks!

00:26:14.162 --> 00:26:14.663
Okay!

00:26:19.026 --> 00:26:19.986
Today is the day!

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:21.227
Today is the day!

00:26:22.148 --> 00:26:23.849
What does sesame oil smell like?

00:26:24.109 --> 00:26:25.070
Sesame oil.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.692
It smells like oil and sesame.

00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:32.895
It smells very delicious.

00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:35.717
Confidence, Moco-chan?

00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:36.618
I don't know.

00:26:38.112 --> 00:26:39.333
Maybe it's different.

00:26:40.514 --> 00:26:40.914
I don't know.

00:26:40.954 --> 00:26:43.976
Last time when we did the soy sauce, it was not good.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:45.597
But now!

00:26:45.617 --> 00:26:47.998
Soy for soy does not equal joy.

00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:49.359
What?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.660
No!

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.041
But now, I don't know.

00:26:53.061 --> 00:26:55.763
Soy for sesame.

00:26:56.443 --> 00:26:56.964
Oh.

00:26:58.485 --> 00:27:00.706
Okay, she has a lumpy.

00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:05.029
It just smells like sesame oil.

00:27:09.701 --> 00:27:10.502
Should I chew it?

00:27:10.883 --> 00:27:11.263
Yeah!

00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:12.825
Should I chew it, Ruffians?

00:27:14.708 --> 00:27:16.310
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:19.054
I feel like if I chew it, I might ruin everything.

00:27:20.636 --> 00:27:21.157
Chew it.

00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:23.841
Well, you could swallow it, and then you could try again.

00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:27.390
Okay, I'm gonna try chewing it then.

00:27:28.191 --> 00:27:28.711
Okay!

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.711
3, 2, 1!

00:27:30.252 --> 00:27:32.253
Oh, it's in there.

00:27:32.433 --> 00:27:32.934
It's in there.

00:27:33.454 --> 00:27:34.555
Oh, that's a big sting.

00:27:34.575 --> 00:27:34.615
Oh?

00:27:35.075 --> 00:27:35.215
Oh?

00:27:35.555 --> 00:27:35.695
Oh?

00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:38.517
Her eyebrows aren't... Oh?

00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:39.198
Oh?

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:40.298
Iketa?

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.160
Did she... She did it!

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.080
I eat it.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.721
Oh, okay, next bean!

00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:46.342
It tasted like sesame oil.

00:27:46.482 --> 00:27:48.043
It tasted like sesame oil.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.690
Next bean!

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.871
Can you do two this time?

00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:53.932
Can I do two?

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.272
Do two, Moco-chan!

00:27:55.292 --> 00:28:00.794
Is sesame oil a miracle?

00:28:00.814 --> 00:28:04.976
Get two this time, Moco-chan.

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.616
No, I need to eat three.

00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:09.437
I don't taste it in my mouth at all.

00:28:09.637 --> 00:28:11.678
This shouldn't count!

00:28:11.738 --> 00:28:12.678
What do you mean?!

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:14.839
What do you mean about that?!

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:15.479
I ate it!

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.540
One second, I'm gonna try again.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.240
Another bean.

00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:18.881
Here we go!

00:28:20.481 --> 00:28:20.821
It's in!

00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:23.342
Okay, okay.

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:24.342
Oh no.

00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:25.322
Oh no.

00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:27.082
Oh no.

00:28:28.403 --> 00:28:29.283
The eyebrows.

00:28:30.403 --> 00:28:31.143
It's okay, you're good.

00:28:31.503 --> 00:28:31.964
You chewed it.

00:28:34.184 --> 00:28:34.644
I cleared it.

00:28:34.664 --> 00:28:38.025
Okay, time for another, Moco-chan!

00:28:38.065 --> 00:28:39.685
Time for another!

00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:41.866
You can do three, that'll be your high score.

00:28:43.586 --> 00:28:45.947
Will you be happy if I get the high score?

00:28:50.366 --> 00:28:55.309
This one looks really sticky though.

00:28:55.329 --> 00:28:56.670
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.851
You can do it!

00:29:19.889 --> 00:29:20.269
Moco-chan!

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.990
Hang in there!

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.391
Hang in there!

00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:26.031
Hang in there!

00:29:45.094 --> 00:29:46.075
I did it!

00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:48.836
It went all over my lips and I really did not like that!

00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:53.019
I really did not like it all over my lips and now I have it on my fingers.

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.900
You did it, Moco-chan!

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.721
I did it!

00:29:55.781 --> 00:30:00.984
Ruffians, you're proud of me!

00:30:01.585 --> 00:30:04.626
The sesame oil was the cheat code.

00:30:05.367 --> 00:30:08.829
Okay, Moco-chan, but how are we gonna proceed from here?

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:09.690
I don't know.

00:30:11.857 --> 00:30:13.558
I think you have to do a mouthful, no?

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:14.358
NO!

00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:18.340
I did three.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.441
I did three beans, okay?

00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:21.322
Can you do two more?

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:22.102
Last time!

00:30:22.142 --> 00:30:23.383
Two at once, Moco-chan?

00:30:23.423 --> 00:30:23.843
No!

00:30:23.943 --> 00:30:24.643
Last time!

00:30:24.683 --> 00:30:25.444
Two at once?

00:30:25.484 --> 00:30:26.444
I think you could do it.

00:30:26.664 --> 00:30:30.306
Last week, I just touched it with my tongue and it was not good.

00:30:30.326 --> 00:30:31.727
Okay.

00:30:32.447 --> 00:30:37.229
See, maybe this is just a case of you have to take one step forward and then five steps back.

00:30:37.249 --> 00:30:38.110
Right?

00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:41.554
Moco-chan!

00:30:41.594 --> 00:30:43.275
BAU BAU!

00:30:43.455 --> 00:30:44.135
I did my best!

00:30:44.395 --> 00:30:45.556
Are you proud, Ruffians?

00:30:45.576 --> 00:30:47.177
I'm hungry beans!

00:30:47.337 --> 00:30:49.318
Are you proud?

00:30:50.278 --> 00:30:51.339
You did it, Moco-chan!

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:52.259
Are you proud?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.301
Next step is to eat the whole package.

00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:56.202
No.

00:30:56.562 --> 00:30:57.222
You can do it.

00:30:58.023 --> 00:30:58.243
No.

00:30:58.663 --> 00:31:02.165
It might just take a lot of sesame oil, but... BAU BAU!

00:31:03.129 --> 00:31:14.173
Remember, Ruffians, how hard Moco-chan has been working these past many, many countless weeks to challenge the natto and apply that to anything you want to do, okay?

00:31:14.193 --> 00:31:15.054
You can do it!

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:16.654
BAU BAU!

00:31:19.115 --> 00:31:21.037
Why are you laughing?

00:31:21.137 --> 00:31:23.358
Because you're silly, huh?

00:31:23.438 --> 00:31:24.559
It's true!

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:31.204
Well, let's continue on to our Doggie of the Day!

00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:37.008
Our Doggie of the Day is... Da-da!

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:37.889
Jake!

00:31:38.009 --> 00:31:38.669
Jake!

00:31:38.729 --> 00:31:40.350
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:40.771
Jake!

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.131
Jake really loves to walk, huh?

00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:51.233
This day, I think you know he was being a bit stubborn and cold outside, you know?

00:31:51.253 --> 00:31:54.915
But actually, Moco-chan gets like this sometimes, too.

00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:56.515
Sometimes, maybe.

00:31:56.575 --> 00:32:01.397
But Jake also really likes snoozing and sniffing things, too.

00:32:01.817 --> 00:32:06.179
Using the sniffer, but he's apparently also scared of water bottles.

00:32:06.699 --> 00:32:07.339
That makes sense.

00:32:07.379 --> 00:32:09.680
Sometimes, you know, they can open really fast, like BAM!

00:32:10.305 --> 00:32:10.585
Right.

00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:19.071
Yeah, I don't know, but I feel like he's the type to be scared of water bottles in the best way possible.

00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:19.792
I know.

00:32:19.832 --> 00:32:20.752
They can be scary.

00:32:20.852 --> 00:32:21.092
It's okay.

00:32:21.132 --> 00:32:23.514
Yeah, well, how does Jake BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

00:32:23.534 --> 00:32:24.054
Like a... BAU!

00:32:24.074 --> 00:32:38.925
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:40.065
Boy!

00:32:40.886 --> 00:32:42.007
Surprise.

00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:47.152
But you know, perfect is born.

00:32:47.592 --> 00:32:51.076
And I think Jake does a really good job to help us remember that.

00:32:51.276 --> 00:32:54.839
It's good, you know, water bottles can be scary.

00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:57.041
And that's fine, right?

00:32:57.101 --> 00:33:03.347
You know, Jake feels comfortable with you, you know, to be able to show that side of himself.

00:33:03.427 --> 00:33:07.069
You know, and he's not afraid to complain about the cold weather either.

00:33:07.169 --> 00:33:07.929
Oh, that's nice.

00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.249
Right?

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:09.950
That just shows how much he loves you.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.391
How comfortable he feels with you.

00:33:12.611 --> 00:33:12.971
Right?

00:33:13.051 --> 00:33:19.294
You know, and I'm sure that when he can, he'll surely love to snuggle up next to you.

00:33:19.474 --> 00:33:20.555
Snuggle!

00:33:20.575 --> 00:33:21.936
BAU BAU!

00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:28.139
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:30.840
We have... De-den!

00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:34.518
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:52.428
Right.

00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:52.909
Right.

00:33:53.289 --> 00:33:53.529
Right.

00:34:10.557 --> 00:34:11.878
Ah, I'm Abyss.

00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:13.679
I feel like I would like to fly.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.040
Take me there!

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.120
Fly!

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.201
In the sky there.

00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:17.461
I'd probably cry.

00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:19.923
It should be kind of dangerous because it's cold out.

00:34:20.003 --> 00:34:20.683
It might freeze.

00:34:20.723 --> 00:34:21.684
Your tears might freeze.

00:34:21.704 --> 00:34:22.044
Bye.

00:34:22.765 --> 00:34:26.407
Make sure you stay warm, stay safe, okay?

00:34:26.467 --> 00:34:26.907
Okay!

00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:27.488
BAU BAU!

00:34:28.668 --> 00:34:39.295
And for our Question of the Day, we have... When did Fuwawa start drinking matcha lattes?

00:34:40.296 --> 00:34:46.400
It sounds like you have a machine for it, so do you drink it often?

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:53.625
And because of your unique way of drinking tea, is there anything special you do to your lattes?

00:35:00.609 --> 00:35:02.790
First, Ruffians, do you think I have a machine?

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:11.192
To add to it first, I did start drinking matcha lattes a few years ago.

00:35:11.933 --> 00:35:16.574
At first, I always thought it was really hard to make them on your own, like it was impossible.

00:35:16.594 --> 00:35:19.335
But that's not it at all.

00:35:19.355 --> 00:35:21.476
You just have to make sure you have the proper

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:22.056
Uh-uh.

00:35:22.096 --> 00:35:22.357
Uh-uh.

00:35:22.677 --> 00:35:22.817
Uh-uh.

00:35:45.951 --> 00:35:49.593
You know, just a chashaku to scoop the matcha out of the container.

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:52.535
A chasen to whisk the tea.

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.817
And then an ochawan to mix it in with the tea cup.

00:35:56.158 --> 00:35:56.858
And then my hands!

00:35:57.338 --> 00:35:58.059
Power!

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.601
I have it almost every day.

00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:03.782
It's like my special treat to myself.

00:36:04.503 --> 00:36:06.724
But only whenever I feel like I need it.

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:09.046
Almost every day.

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.427
Almost every day.

00:36:10.447 --> 00:36:10.868
Ruffians!

00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:11.448
Yeah.

00:36:11.629 --> 00:36:13.570
Sometimes she has it twice a day.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.293
That's only when I really need it.

00:36:17.113 --> 00:36:20.436
But Moco-chan, the last time I made it, I made one for you.

00:36:20.457 --> 00:36:20.597
You did.

00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:21.998
You did make one for me.

00:36:22.278 --> 00:36:22.598
I did.

00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:22.779
I did.

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:24.020
Can you do T-70?

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.182
I studied Urasenke.

00:36:26.362 --> 00:36:30.846
But Urasenke method for a little bit, but I don't really remember it too much.

00:36:31.266 --> 00:36:33.208
I'd like to learn more though.

00:36:33.248 --> 00:36:33.809
But yeah.

00:36:34.809 --> 00:36:40.772
There's really nothing special that I do to it, but I usually like having it cold, like a cold latte.

00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:41.753
With soy milk.

00:36:42.373 --> 00:36:43.314
Soy milk.

00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:47.156
It has to be soy milk for me, otherwise it's just, it's not quite right.

00:36:47.696 --> 00:36:51.098
Yeah, but Ruffians- Different milks have different tastes, you know?

00:36:51.178 --> 00:36:52.098
I know, yeah.

00:36:52.118 --> 00:36:55.760
But you should definitely try it, it's not that difficult.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.023
And then also if you're getting all the lumps in it, then you can use, what's it called?

00:37:01.343 --> 00:37:02.083
The shifter.

00:37:02.183 --> 00:37:03.204
The shifter, yeah.

00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:16.539
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions, your scoops, your questions, your Doggie of the Day, your peros and our sightings!

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:32.750
Thank you.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:43.000
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is only a show that we make together, so we hope that it will continue to be just like that, okay?

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.785
Thank you so much, FUWAMOCO!

00:37:48.845 --> 00:37:52.488
For our next stream, we have De-den!

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.231
White Album!

00:37:55.251 --> 00:37:56.572
It's this season!

00:37:56.672 --> 00:37:57.892
It's the snowy season!

00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:59.073
Snowy season!

00:37:59.113 --> 00:38:05.336
And that means that today, we're starting the classic winter vision novel, White Album.

00:38:05.396 --> 00:38:19.704
And it's a game that's very special to us, and I was actually playing the original version last year, but even though I was using a lot of different walkthroughs and was very, very careful to save a lot, I made a mistake and I kinda got stuck because it was RNG, it wasn't my part, but...

00:38:20.584 --> 00:38:24.927
This time, we'll make sure to conquer yuki with no problem.

00:38:25.228 --> 00:38:37.197
You know it's a very dramatic and kind of sometimes not the happiest turn of events kind of story but if you're interested in romance and idols back in the 80s in Japan, you'll have to

00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:38.998
BAU BAU!

00:38:39.218 --> 00:38:45.800
It's really, really, really fun and I'm very excited to play the remake.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.482
I only played the little remake.
