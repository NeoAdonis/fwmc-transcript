## 👀 Pero Sighting ([06:55](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=06m55s))

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/Yumial_/status/1689299318535294977) found Pero… in The Backrooms again?! FUWAMOCO to the rescue once more! And this time they won't be by themselves: Fubuki-senpai will go with them!

## 😊 Good News ([09:55](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=09m55s))

Papa puppy (who FUWAMOCO have barely seen since debut) saves the day by fixing a lightbulb by just touching it!

## ❌ Misunderstanding ([12:00](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=12m00s))

To nobody's surprise, today's misunderstanding was brought to you by [Advent's Gartic Phone collab](https://youtu.be/srTTcF_qgFw), as Mococo didn't mean to [make anyone think about Biboo giving birth to Moai statues](https://youtu.be/srTTcF_qgFw??t=2945).

## 🙇 Apology ([14:34](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=14m34s))

Fuwawa apologizes that things got a bit heated up during their Cookie & Cream stream, and [said some things she didn't mean](https://youtu.be/FDxOHaixvQw?t=15081), like the D-word: dude.

## 🎁 Surprise ([17:41](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=17m41s))

[Pako-sensei](https://twitter.com/pakosun/status/1704474239670325274), inspired by a certain "soul taker" anime, turned Moco-chan into a magical girl. [Moco-Moco Fuwa-Fuwa Violence!!](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=18m37s)

## 📣 Mococo Pup Talk ([19:47](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=19m47s))

Mococo gives Ruffians yet another of her now-famous motivational speeches to keep on pushing as we reach the middle of the week!

## 🐶 Doggie of the Day ([22:09](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=22m09s))

Featuring today: [nikutaro1227](https://twitter.com/nikutaro1227/status/1703984492178968760)'s Chame. *TL: Chame fell asleep in between the sliding doors. He sleeps in such weird places often.*

## 🚶 Today I Went On A Walk ([24:18](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=24m18s))

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/InquisitiveRav/status/1703079765240877497) went on a walk to an apple orchard and picked lots of apples!

## ❓ Question Of The Day ([25:49](https://youtu.be/_aK_6Wb05hY?t=25m49s))

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/TsundereAdmiral/status/1704287044078629101) wonders if FUWAMOCO have a ritual to prepare mentally before a presentation. While they barely get nervous anymore after all their guard dog training, both a walk and stretching helps them to get rid of any anxiety they might have before a big presentation. If they need something more, they rub each other's back. As for Mococo, lying on the floor helps her too!
