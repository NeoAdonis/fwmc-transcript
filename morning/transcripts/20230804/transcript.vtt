00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.500
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.856
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.358
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:16.980
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:26.124
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:29.585
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:34.687
Thank you for joining us for our second episode!

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.808
It's happening, Moco-chan.

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:38.409
Is it happening?

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:39.509
It's happening!

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.150
Is it happening?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.570
Today!

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:54.349
Despite of a FUWAMOCO Morning, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.415
FUWAMOCO is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO Mococo.

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:01.018
What did you say?

00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:03.360
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:12.470
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.375
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:23.280
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:25.963
BAU BAU!

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.725
Now, now, now.

00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:30.098
Now.

00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:30.999
Ruffians!

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.679
Ruffians!

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.680
Ruffians!

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.641
You know it!

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:35.903
We can't be quiet about this anymore.

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:38.825
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:52.495
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:54.957
Thank you for 400,000 Ruffians!

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:55.778
400,000 Ruffians!

00:06:57.393 --> 00:06:58.513
And you know what?

00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:01.114
It's only been four days since we debuted.

00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:02.115
Only four days.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:07.136
That's... Can you believe it?

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:11.138
We never ever thought we'd be at such a momentous moment so soon.

00:07:11.578 --> 00:07:12.558
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:13.118
Thank you!

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:13.719
Arisato!

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:15.379
Thank you!

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:23.502
I'm really really happy and so thankful for all your warm support and all the happy BAU BAUs!

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:24.842
Yeah, happy BAU BAUs.

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:25.623
Yeah.

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.381
As you can imagine, it hasn't been a perfectly easy road.

00:07:32.882 --> 00:07:34.282
Yeah, folks, folks, folks.

00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:36.604
We're not really expecting it to be bad.

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:40.506
But even so, it's a thousand percent worth it.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.026
Two thousand.

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:41.907
Two thousand.

00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:42.767
Two thousand.

00:07:42.807 --> 00:07:44.848
A thousand for me, a thousand for you, right?

00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:46.029
Two thousand, yeah.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:50.531
We want to continue to have lots of special times for you, okay?

00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:53.033
So we're gonna do our best.

00:07:53.293 --> 00:07:54.694
Thank you so much, Ruffians.

00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:57.135
Thank you!

00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:03.159
You know with every step, we're getting a little bit closer to our goal of 1 million Ruffians.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.360
Little step every day.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.220
Right, right.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.021
Thank you!

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:11.264
BAU BAU!

00:08:11.784 --> 00:08:17.648
Next, we wanted to introduce something that we're really excited about but maybe you kind of overlooked.

00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:18.448
I...

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.742
Sighting Voice Pack!

00:08:24.862 --> 00:08:26.703
Sighting Voice!

00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:32.184
Along with the release of Abyn's debut merch, was also the release of our Sighting Voice Pack!

00:08:32.204 --> 00:08:34.544
Yeah, we talked about it before, but did you forget?

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:35.125
Maybe.

00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:38.505
There's so much stuff, it's okay if you forgot.

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:49.588
Actually, this time, we're technically the first hololive members to have the Sighting Voices released at the very start of their time at hololive, so it's truly a sighting voice.

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:51.448
Very, very sighting.

00:08:51.528 --> 00:08:51.688
Yeah.

00:08:52.168 --> 00:08:57.151
But we had a lot of fun recording them, both in English and Japanese.

00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.652
Maybe too much fun.

00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:03.296
For Ruffians that don't know what the voice pack is, what is it?

00:09:05.114 --> 00:09:07.816
We recorded a saying something just for you.

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:09.577
Something very special.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:10.578
But it's a secret.

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:11.939
Until you find out.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:21.847
But what's special about this starting voice is that we have actually two starting voices because there's one in English and one in Japanese.

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.208
And there's lots of different types, you know.

00:09:24.288 --> 00:09:29.673
There's the self-introduction, the morning good morning voice, and the good night voice.

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:32.926
What are your thoughts?

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:33.206
Tell us!

00:09:33.286 --> 00:09:33.646
Tell us!

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:35.086
Were you able to get them?

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:51.898
Very cute!

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:52.438
Very cute!

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:52.939
Love it!

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:53.399
Thank you!

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:55.241
And the Japanese one was good too!

00:09:55.261 --> 00:10:00.886
See, that's the thing, because there's both the English and the Japanese.

00:10:06.952 --> 00:10:07.613
Enjoy both, right?

00:10:07.693 --> 00:10:10.775
This is what Fuwawa was like in English.

00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:12.757
This is what she's like in Japanese.

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:19.022
I don't know if there's much of a better thing than getting a bit of help from Moco-chan or myself, waking up in FUWAMOCO morning.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:20.543
Because it's the morning voice too, right?

00:10:32.156 --> 00:10:36.777
Shiori, you can have the bestest, bestest FUWAMOCO Morning that way.

00:10:36.997 --> 00:10:37.518
Every day?

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:38.478
Every day, yeah.

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:41.819
Shiori, even on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:47.800
Can you give the Ruffians maybe a tiny sample of what a starting voice might be like?

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.361
Like, morning, morning voice.

00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:51.381
Morning voice?

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:54.182
I just woke up an hour ago.

00:10:54.242 --> 00:10:55.442
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:57.003
I just started on my own.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.003
3, 2, 1!

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.130
You're gonna wake me up?

00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:05.411
No!

00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:06.351
No!

00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.612
That's not a very cute starting voice.

00:11:09.632 --> 00:11:11.152
That's not what it's like, you know?

00:11:11.953 --> 00:11:13.433
But that's your example?

00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:14.934
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

00:11:14.954 --> 00:11:16.794
Moco-chan, what's your example then?

00:11:16.994 --> 00:11:18.455
It's very different from reality.

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:19.395
You'll have to find out.

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:24.036
3, 2... I gotta count down.

00:11:24.056 --> 00:11:24.977
Okay, okay, count down, count down.

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:26.977
3, 2, 1, 1!

00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:31.934
Excuse me.

00:11:32.634 --> 00:11:33.975
It's time to wake up now.

00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:36.576
It's very different from reality too.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:37.516
Please wake up now.

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:41.998
It's time to wake up now.

00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:48.021
You'll have to find out what reality is actually like by checking out the starting voices.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.563
Let us know more about your thoughts with the hashtag FUWAMOCO.

00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:53.764
We'll be looking.

00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:55.684
Let us know how you enjoy them too.

00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:00.379
Thank you!

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.100
Don't say thank you there.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.240
Thank you.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.262
Well, unfortunately, we have a continuation of this corner.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.104
Didn't intend to continue, but here we are.

00:12:11.204 --> 00:12:11.925
It happened.

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:12.825
It happened again.

00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:17.767
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:12:18.328 --> 00:12:19.688
There has been.

00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:22.750
Well, you know what?

00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:32.570
And yesterday's typing of the dead overkill stream, Moco-chan might have added a word that took everyone by surprise for that.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:38.473
And as Moco-chan's older sister, I would like to apologize very very deeply.

00:12:38.493 --> 00:12:41.094
Moco-chan?

00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:42.634
Moco-chan?

00:12:42.654 --> 00:12:43.015
What?

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:47.117
What are you gonna say?

00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:51.639
I'm sorry that I shocked you.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.303
Moco-chan, you're not gonna say things like that again, right?

00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.903
I didn't say anything.

00:12:59.923 --> 00:13:03.425
You might have heard something else, but it wasn't what you thought, okay?

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:04.566
I'm an innocent puppy.

00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:05.426
Okay?

00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:08.248
Is that enough of an apology?

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.349
Ruffians, I don't know.

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:10.429
I'm innocent!

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:11.830
Forgive me!

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.233
You have to apologize straight, Moco-chan.

00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:19.194
I'm sorry.

00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:28.417
Kono tabi wa taihen moushiwaki gozaimasen deshita.

00:13:49.249 --> 00:13:50.669
You apologized too, Moco-chan.

00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:51.630
I apologized!

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.870
I don't know if it's enough.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.351
Mococo did nothing wrong!

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:56.611
I did nothing wrong.

00:13:56.631 --> 00:14:00.232
Are you sure that's an apology?

00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:00.552
Yes.

00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:05.954
Well, there's been another misunderstanding.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.809
Maybe it's a happiness one?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.351
Well, maybe.

00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:19.535
You saw on Twitter, but all of hololive was interviewed by Crunchyroll.

00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:20.836
It sounds delicious.

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:22.697
Did you check some of them out?

00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:25.179
Ours was actually released yesterday.

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:29.842
We talked a lot about what it was like becoming a member of hololive.

00:14:29.942 --> 00:14:31.523
Also about our favorite anime too.

00:14:33.184 --> 00:14:41.987
We were supposed to choose only our top 10 anime, but in the end, we only got to 11.

00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:43.168
Yeah.

00:14:43.468 --> 00:14:44.868
I feel like there's a lot more.

00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:46.849
There is a lot more.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.670
No, like, I feel like I had 50.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.410
Why?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.332
I was like, oh, this one wasn't included.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:56.133
That one wasn't included.

00:14:56.153 --> 00:14:57.353
Like, ah, I forgot something.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:58.453
Yeah, like, ah.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.594
But, uh,

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:04.622
Can you imagine what it was like, the process between the two of us to be able to decide?

00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:07.204
It was a very long process.

00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:08.204
A bit of a battle.

00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:12.307
Weighing, you know, this and that, this and that.

00:15:12.647 --> 00:15:13.308
Very important.

00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:15.349
But there's been a misunderstanding.

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:15.849
Again.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.313
Some of the pictures in the article maybe were a bit confusing.

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:23.264
We would like to specify.

00:15:23.304 --> 00:15:23.524
Yes, specify.

00:15:23.544 --> 00:15:23.864
Kemono Friends!

00:15:23.884 --> 00:15:24.525
Kemono Friends 1.

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:24.985
We did not watch 2.

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:25.305
No.

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:25.506
No.

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:25.946
There's a reason.

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:41.259
For Genshiken, we might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might, might,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.640
You understand?

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:43.561
Original.

00:15:43.982 --> 00:15:44.883
We want you to understand.

00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:46.505
Kujian's OVA.

00:15:47.386 --> 00:15:47.886
It's so good.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.708
That's Kujian's OVA.

00:15:49.728 --> 00:15:51.550
But it's inside of Genshiken.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.331
True, true, true.

00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:54.494
You get it?

00:15:54.714 --> 00:15:55.255
Understand?

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:57.236
Understood?

00:15:57.796 --> 00:15:58.596
Understandable?

00:15:58.616 --> 00:15:58.936
Good?

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.797
We hope you enjoyed the long form interview.

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:03.557
If you haven't checked it out, please check it out.

00:16:04.098 --> 00:16:08.518
Maybe was there anything else that stood out or surprised you?

00:16:08.538 --> 00:16:11.819
There was also a special voice that we recorded just for it.

00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:13.900
So please go check it out, okay?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.980
There's a Kemono Friends 2?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.860
No there isn't.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.413
I don't know what to read.

00:16:23.473 --> 00:16:25.677
The biggest misunderstanding of all.

00:16:25.697 --> 00:16:31.306
I think the Ruffians know.

00:16:31.326 --> 00:16:35.893
You know, during a Q&A stream,

00:16:37.472 --> 00:16:41.175
Got a very good question about what some of our favorite Japanese words are, you know?

00:16:41.495 --> 00:16:42.136
It's a good question.

00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:47.720
But, unfortunately there was a bit of confusion with my answer.

00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:57.168
It was kind of really, really, really embarrassing to say much more and explain more, but you know there's a good reason, there's a good reason.

00:16:57.588 --> 00:17:01.291
So, in English, you know, there's... Ruffians, what?

00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:04.072
But, in English!

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:05.933
But, but Fuwawa explain!

00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:10.355
There's no specific word for this, you know, because you don't need a word like that.

00:17:10.595 --> 00:17:11.695
It's not necessary.

00:17:12.956 --> 00:17:22.040
But, you know, in Japan, like, it was like a way to woo and confess a girl that you liked and get married.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.781
You know, it's interesting, like, culturally.

00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:28.082
But, but, you know, if you think about it,

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.730
But then, I have a bit of a story.

00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:35.074
One day... That's so bad!

00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:37.636
I was watching Japanese TV!

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:45.544
I was watching Japanese TV, and a TV crew was interviewing elderly couples, and you know, asking them how they met.

00:17:46.946 --> 00:17:49.028
And then there was this one grandpa that was like,

00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:50.195
Yobai.

00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:57.158
And he was like... And then the grandma started to get so mad at him!

00:17:57.318 --> 00:18:01.520
Yeah, they had a very interesting relationship dynamic.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.241
She was very, very angry.

00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.761
I was really shocked, you know?

00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:10.663
I felt like... Yobai is very, very, very real now.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:16.920
Do you understand now?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.320
Do you understand?

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.882
Maybe, do you feel like it's a really interesting Japanese word too?

00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:23.483
Is it your favorite now too?

00:18:23.743 --> 00:18:24.983
I like homorebi.

00:18:26.224 --> 00:18:29.345
Homorebi's good too, but it doesn't have the impact.

00:18:32.787 --> 00:18:33.667
Understand now, yes?

00:18:34.128 --> 00:18:34.348
Yes.

00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:35.548
Mazui.

00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:35.948
Really?

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:38.470
Really?

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.312
It's interesting from a cultural standpoint.

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:45.685
You like it too?

00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:46.705
It's your favorite too!

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:48.046
It's your favorite too!

00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:50.806
My sister is embarrassing.

00:18:52.227 --> 00:18:54.707
I wasn't the one that said the other thing, Moco-chan.

00:18:55.448 --> 00:18:56.128
What did I say?

00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:59.449
You apologized, but now you don't even remember.

00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:01.149
Was that really an apology?

00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:03.149
I'm innocent!

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:11.051
Okay, well it seems like the Ruffians understand, so... Misunderstanding?

00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:11.972
No more.

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:12.372
Cleared!

00:19:14.677 --> 00:19:17.099
We have a confession.

00:19:36.158 --> 00:19:39.421
Right, Moco-chan?

00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:42.184
You are something that you confess.

00:19:42.864 --> 00:19:45.927
And then I'll just nod.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:50.051
So, there is something that I wanted to say.

00:19:50.987 --> 00:19:59.429
During our Q&A stream the other day, I think there was a question about if there's any senpai in particular that we look up to.

00:20:00.269 --> 00:20:02.329
And we answered that we love all senpai.

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:04.170
Because they all have their own special traits.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.410
And it makes them unique and strong.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.050
And that's true, yeah.

00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:10.251
And we really admire all of them.

00:20:10.631 --> 00:20:14.892
But we do have senpai we admire the most.

00:20:17.492 --> 00:20:19.853
But... To tell the truth,

00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:25.600
We don't really want to say names outright because we don't want to put pressure on them, you know?

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.463
Yeah, no pressure.

00:20:27.483 --> 00:20:29.425
They're very, very busy.

00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:32.730
Yeah, we wouldn't want to do that straight from the start to them, you know?

00:20:34.412 --> 00:20:35.193
Do you understand?

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:38.695
BAU!

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:43.360
You understand!

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:52.430
But yeah, we saw something, you know, and in our hearts we're like, oh, that's not how we feel at all.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.492
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:20:54.552 --> 00:20:54.753
Yeah.

00:20:54.993 --> 00:20:56.795
Yeah, but this is not the misunderstanding corner.

00:20:56.815 --> 00:20:58.076
This is the confession corner.

00:20:58.316 --> 00:20:58.517
Yeah.

00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:05.380
So, today, we wanted to talk about one senpai in particular that we both admire.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.300
Yeah.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.842
I mentioned it before, but I was actually so nervous then!

00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:19.065
I felt like I was gonna forget what I was saying and the titles of songs that I've listened to over and over and over, because I was too shaky.

00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:21.546
So, I couldn't say anything.

00:21:21.606 --> 00:21:24.167
I couldn't say what I wanted to say, but now I feel the same, so...

00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:36.492
But I wanted to say... I don't know if it's ready!

00:21:39.473 --> 00:21:44.215
Okay, I'm going to say it with a clear consciousness.

00:21:44.255 --> 00:21:45.035
Consciousness?

00:21:45.315 --> 00:21:45.475
Yeah.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:45.755
Okay.

00:21:48.946 --> 00:21:54.632
I really admire Fuka-senpai.

00:21:54.672 --> 00:21:57.214
Moco-chan drew a special drawing too.

00:21:57.454 --> 00:22:05.842
I really admire all her charisma, energy, her voice, her humor, and especially I really really love her music.

00:22:06.983 --> 00:22:09.485
Especially her originals, but also her covers too.

00:22:11.147 --> 00:22:17.751
I tried to say it, but my favorite song is definitely Ever Blue, because whenever it comes on I always have to stop in my tracks and be like, wait!

00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:18.932
It's my song!

00:22:18.952 --> 00:22:21.234
It's not your song!

00:22:21.374 --> 00:22:22.214
It's not my song!

00:22:22.234 --> 00:22:24.456
But it's like, you know, it's my song.

00:22:24.836 --> 00:22:25.216
You know?

00:22:25.237 --> 00:22:35.544
And it's embarrassing, but I actually can't watch Psychotic Poker without crying, so I don't attempt to watch it anymore.

00:22:36.264 --> 00:22:37.965
It makes Moco-chan cry.

00:22:37.985 --> 00:22:39.846
Good tears, not sad tears.

00:22:39.866 --> 00:22:41.187
Yeah, but it makes me cry.

00:22:41.207 --> 00:22:45.989
And my favorite cover of hers is Kick Back.

00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:51.252
And whenever I hear regular Kick Back, I have to stop listening to it and go listen to Pokka's Kick Back.

00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:56.334
Because she made it her own song with the high harmony, and I can't listen to it without the high harmony.

00:22:58.223 --> 00:23:01.125
Yeah, we really admire Poko-senpai's drive.

00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:03.908
No, I'm embarrassed!

00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:10.393
But you know, Poko-senpai, I'm sure you feel this way too, but she's so funny and she's made us laugh a lot too.

00:23:11.054 --> 00:23:13.936
Even though her mouse was broken.

00:23:14.056 --> 00:23:15.878
Yeah, it was broken.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.679
We forget Poko-senpai.

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:19.881
She wouldn't ever say anything that's not true.

00:23:21.282 --> 00:23:21.683
That's all.

00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:28.735
Did I manage to say this without being all over the place?

00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:30.018
No.

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:33.988
Confession over.

00:23:34.804 --> 00:23:35.044
Over.

00:23:35.264 --> 00:23:35.905
Over.

00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:36.785
Over.

00:23:37.245 --> 00:23:41.208
Well next, we're gonna go to our regular question.

00:23:41.468 --> 00:23:44.990
We have our Doggie of the Day!

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.930
De-den!

00:23:46.471 --> 00:23:49.893
Here's the Doggie of the Day, BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:50.113 --> 00:23:53.675
His name is Paco, and he's the Barking Warrior.

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:56.176
It's like, FUWAMOCO Paco.

00:23:56.276 --> 00:23:57.977
FUWAMOCO Paco!

00:23:58.697 --> 00:24:02.520
Look at his little eyes, they have like a soft glint of

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.741
What a heroic face.

00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:06.142
Yeah, very brave.

00:24:06.202 --> 00:24:07.463
I can see it right there.

00:24:07.503 --> 00:24:10.204
He kind of looks like a movie star.

00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:11.705
A very unique face.

00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:15.608
Yeah, sort of like a... Like somebody in Star Wars.

00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:18.069
Like Han Solo.

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:18.349
Yeah.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:25.013
I wonder what... Very, very royal feeling.

00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:26.874
What does his bike sound like?

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:29.956
I think it's kind of like... I think he's like a...

00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:44.883
I would give Paco the reading that you'll probably never ever lose him in a doggy pack.

00:24:45.144 --> 00:24:47.505
He's a very unique and lovely boy.

00:24:47.525 --> 00:24:50.568
Make sure you protect your smile, okay?

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:53.130
Because it's really really bright.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.565
Are we sure that nose is real and not fake?

00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:03.189
It looks like one on a teddy bear.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.173
Thank you for the Doggie of the Day!

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:12.238
Next corner is... Today, I went on a walk.

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:15.582
Today's walk is this!

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:18.842
It's so beautiful.

00:25:18.922 --> 00:25:20.183
Nice nature path.

00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:21.763
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:24.724
Is it the morning or the daytime?

00:25:24.784 --> 00:25:25.845
It looks like morning!

00:25:26.045 --> 00:25:28.986
You know, I think it'd be very, very nice all day, right?

00:25:29.006 --> 00:25:29.346
Yeah.

00:25:29.706 --> 00:25:30.846
Except, I guess, maybe for night.

00:25:30.966 --> 00:25:32.427
But that's not daytime.

00:25:32.487 --> 00:25:33.207
That's too scary.

00:25:33.627 --> 00:25:35.128
It looks like ghosts could come out.

00:25:36.108 --> 00:25:37.648
Not in the daytime.

00:25:37.868 --> 00:25:38.469
Only nighttime.

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:42.350
It also kind of reminds me of the Northwest Passage a little bit.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.711
It makes me feel a bit nostalgic too, right?

00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:49.154
The air is probably really nice and fresh and crisp.

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:50.775
There's probably a lot of bugs around.

00:25:50.795 --> 00:25:52.657
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

00:25:52.997 --> 00:25:53.818
It's neutral.

00:25:54.298 --> 00:26:00.284
Make sure to dress appropriately when going out on the rough trails like this, right?

00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:02.746
And let your loved ones know beforehand too.

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:04.888
Make sure you're looking where you step, okay?

00:26:04.908 --> 00:26:06.629
Yeah, not to fall on them.

00:26:06.729 --> 00:26:07.490
No tumble.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.331
Thank you!

00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:10.052
Bye bye!

00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.215
And for our Question of the Day... De-den!

00:26:19.773 --> 00:26:22.314
Do you have to remove your human ears when you go to bed?

00:26:22.594 --> 00:26:26.315
Also, I thought I lost my smile, but you were protecting it all along.

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.636
Thank you!

00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:31.697
We promise to protect it forever and ever.

00:26:33.157 --> 00:26:34.618
Moco-chan, you're just gonna wink there?

00:26:34.638 --> 00:26:36.218
Yeah, I'm just gonna stand here and wink.

00:26:36.438 --> 00:26:37.419
But to the question.

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:39.979
Removing our human ears when we go to bed?

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:40.560
We don't!

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.400
No.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.121
Why do you think they're removable?

00:26:45.462 --> 00:26:47.244
They're decoration, but they're there.

00:26:47.284 --> 00:26:48.565
They don't come off.

00:26:48.605 --> 00:26:49.526
They are handy, you know?

00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:52.149
They do have purposes and uses other than just appearance.

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:54.772
But it is like your ears, where they just sit there.

00:26:55.693 --> 00:27:00.618
You know, there's like, these things that are like, they're self-healing eye masks.

00:27:00.718 --> 00:27:03.220
And you can put them on your face when you go to bed.

00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:05.443
And then you have to, you can't put them on the doggy ears.

00:27:05.483 --> 00:27:06.404
You have to put them on the...

00:27:06.824 --> 00:27:09.747
It makes it really easy and nice to fall asleep.

00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:11.508
It smells really good too!

00:27:24.502 --> 00:27:26.105
Bugging you how?

00:27:40.503 --> 00:27:44.646
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:28:10.879 --> 00:28:12.941
Thank you for the question!

00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:14.102
BAU BAU!

00:28:15.323 --> 00:28:17.985
And our next theme is... De-den!

00:28:18.806 --> 00:28:22.789
Moco-chan, are you going to say today?

00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:23.670
Today!

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.491
Today!

00:28:25.892 --> 00:28:30.055
Today we play Love for the Tube with all of Abyss!

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.017
I missed game collab altogether.

00:28:32.037 --> 00:28:33.498
You haven't forgot, right?

00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:34.359
You haven't, right?

00:28:36.203 --> 00:28:39.068
Even though I'm kind of tired of the zombies.

00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:40.371
Just a bit.

00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:43.276
It's okay because I'm really looking forward to...

00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:49.882
Protecting Biboo and Shiori and Arisa, so... And the Ruffians, you're gonna help us too, right?

00:28:50.042 --> 00:28:50.382
Right!

00:28:50.963 --> 00:29:04.506
I don't think we're gonna be the best zombie fighters right off the bat here, but... We'll do our best, so... But actually... We'll let you know a special secret, because you're here with us right now.

00:29:04.526 --> 00:29:07.226
A secret for the Ruffians that are here right now.

00:29:07.527 --> 00:29:09.807
There's a good, good reason to wake up early, right?

00:29:12.028 --> 00:29:13.628
Today, at the very end,

00:29:14.934 --> 00:29:19.997
There's going to be a special announcement from all of Abyss!

00:29:20.078 --> 00:29:22.179
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:26.001
You'll absolutely want to be there, so don't miss it, okay?

00:29:26.382 --> 00:29:27.262
You heard that right.

00:29:27.402 --> 00:29:28.423
Special announcement.

00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:29.704
Special announcement.

00:29:30.064 --> 00:29:30.244
Yes.

00:29:30.724 --> 00:29:32.265
Thank you!

00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:34.707
That's great!

00:29:35.227 --> 00:29:38.329
Let's have a quick last peek at our schedule.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.460
Ice Catcher!

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:51.142
Tomorrow is going to be our first FUWAMOCO Rocket Word Party!

00:29:51.302 --> 00:29:53.503
It's our first Karaoke.

00:29:53.663 --> 00:29:56.124
We actually got a question, right Moco-chan?

00:29:56.164 --> 00:29:58.925
Yes, we got a question about if it will be archived or not.

00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:04.209
For our karaoke, it'll almost always be archived.

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:08.093
Unless something unexpected and rough happens to it.

00:30:08.453 --> 00:30:12.056
If it's gonna be an archive, we'll always let you know in the title if it's gonna be like that.

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.978
It'll say in the title, unarchived.

00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:15.440
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:17.682
You will know.

00:30:18.182 --> 00:30:21.005
And there's also still the question, question, question mic.

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:24.348
We've almost gotten to the week, but we still don't know what it is.

00:30:27.176 --> 00:30:32.399
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special viewers today.

00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:53.221
XZY.

00:30:53.482 --> 00:30:53.742
