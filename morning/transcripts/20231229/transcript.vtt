00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.839
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:12.384
Good morning, motherfluffers!

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:18.368
Another beautiful day is upon us!

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.711
Are there any sleepyheads out there?

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:25.885
Hi!

00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:27.166
You there!

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:30.188
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

00:05:30.248 --> 00:05:33.049
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.251
Are you awake yet?

00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:40.793
Wipe those crusty eyes and let's get going!

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.655
Because an AsaMoco Live is about to begin!

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.497
Just what kind of news stories are waiting for us today?

00:05:49.777 --> 00:05:50.458
Let's take a look.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:06:01.460
Well, back behind my head here being all noisy, we have our live spectators and commenters!

00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.142
Good morning, live spectator commenters!

00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:06.623
Good morning!

00:06:09.565 --> 00:06:10.205
It's you, yes!

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:11.066
It's you, yes!

00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:12.947
Oh, natsukashii!

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.248
Oh, BAU BAU!

00:06:15.748 --> 00:06:17.069
Oh my gosh!

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.910
Oh my gosh!

00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:27.106
Yes, well, we have lots of lovely commenters from our lovely commentators.

00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:31.248
Well, my gosh.

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:34.589
We do have some breaking news.

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:37.531
Well.

00:06:39.864 --> 00:06:43.225
There has been a terror in the community recently.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:51.488
A spherical yet strangely festive white mass has been reported breaking into homes and assaulting individuals.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.169
Have you seen anyone like this?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.770
This nasty criminal?

00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:03.292
Well, if you have, I'm sorry.

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:07.394
The details are

00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:20.260
Rather graphic, but after some big sloppy doggy kisses from the intruder, there are reports of the victims hallucinating and seeing a white Christmas.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.322
There was a high uptick in cases that occurred on Christmas Eve as well.

00:07:25.342 --> 00:07:29.703
According to our resident expert, F,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.341
This style of breaking entry is very, very rude.

00:07:37.141 --> 00:07:38.181
It's very heinous.

00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:50.885
It does not follow the proper rules and regulations that one should be mindful of when performing such an ancient Japanese tradition, such as some that begin with a yo.

00:07:52.105 --> 00:08:01.187
There must be pure emotions and empathy behind it, and there must be beauty, but there is no love in this heart of the criminal.

00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:07.800
What are you talking about, Expert F?

00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:13.585
Maybe Expert F isn't as much of an expert as we thought, huh?

00:08:14.886 --> 00:08:15.387
Wow!

00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:19.270
What do I spectator commenters have to say here, huh?

00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.694
A fluffy expert.

00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:24.535
Are we sure this is an expert?

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:29.180
Maybe just a very fluffy mind.

00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:32.756
Kusa.

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:33.997
Guilty.

00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:35.318
Very scared.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:40.883
Please make sure to be very safe from the Spherical Intruder, okay Ruffians?

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:42.684
BAU BAU!

00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:48.909
Well, there is some sad news to share with you today.

00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:53.133
YouTube has been grumpy and rough

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:54.452
Ms.

00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:56.393
Fuwawa Abyssgard and Ms.

00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:03.116
Mococo Abyssgard of FUWAMOCO Channel on YouTube have had their first major run-in with the platform.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.097
There is some unfair punishment going on.

00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:16.101
After doing a very lovely, very beautiful visual novel style Christmas Eve stream, YouTube has been funny.

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:21.523
And well, it noticed some of the

00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:24.073
Exciting.

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:27.536
Game-like event CG sprinkled through the stream.

00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:32.339
Well, it was very, very exciting for the Ruffians.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:44.567
That excitement also has reached YouTube as well and now they feel like it's not suitable for advertisers and have limited the ads on the video.

00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:46.148
YouTube!

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:47.569
What are you doing?

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:47.749
Hi!

00:09:50.228 --> 00:09:57.653
Well, according to the expert elf, this is something deeply ingrained in what makes YouTube YouTube.

00:09:58.393 --> 00:10:07.279
You could say maybe that this is just a part of YouTube's animalistic instincts, but it's still horrible.

00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:13.584
You know, YouTube helps make smiles, but it can also easily take them away.

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:21.090
Good thing there are some Demon Guard Dog sisters out there to protect your smile, huh?

00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:24.574
You might win this one today, YouTube.

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:26.456
But not forever!

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.338
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:31.101
Moving on to our next story.

00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:33.284
The bad news continues.

00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:41.177
The archiver of hololive English -Advent-, Shiori Novella, has fallen.

00:10:41.977 --> 00:10:48.540
She just released her first cover song ever of Whisper Whisper Whisper by Azari, which is super exciting!

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.041
In fact, it's super duper exciting!

00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.162
It's her first song cover!

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:55.722
BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:56.043 --> 00:10:56.523
Right!

00:10:57.963 --> 00:10:58.984
It's time to celebrate!

00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:00.184
Hai!

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:02.045
But, uh...

00:11:03.098 --> 00:11:08.361
Shiori's release method was also very unique.

00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:15.705
So unique that when there were reports of it coming in, it seemed like we were two weeks late to the party!

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:19.107
But no, that wasn't the truth!

00:11:20.508 --> 00:11:21.609
We contacted Ms.

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:30.874
Shiori Novella for a comment on the matter, and she told us that it was the fault of a mysterious Kuroi Novella!

00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:36.681
This Kuroi Novella character likes the darkness of a silent room.

00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:46.570
And so, when they're clicking around YouTube in the darkness, they accidentally set the video from private to public.

00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.053
What a mysterious figure.

00:11:51.114 --> 00:11:56.659
Well, we can thank them for the accidental gift of Shiori's first cover song!

00:11:57.239 --> 00:11:57.640
But you know,

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:02.860
We would've liked to celebrate the release together with Shiori and all the noveletes.

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:04.821
Good you!

00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:06.662
Good eye novella!

00:12:08.382 --> 00:12:12.364
Well, what do our spectator commenters have to say here, huh?

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:13.824
Whoops.

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:15.525
Whoops is right.

00:12:16.965 --> 00:12:17.645
She's the leader.

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:18.626
She is the leader.

00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:22.985
Kuroi Novella, who is this woman?

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:23.765
Kusat.

00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:24.505
Funny.

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:25.186
Mysterious.

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:26.406
It's all of that.

00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:32.670
Well, let's check out Shiori's cover and cheer her on, okay?

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:36.092
Continuing our news.

00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:46.037
There has been some recent suspicions arise around FUWAMOCO and their song choices when it comes to Japanese music.

00:12:47.611 --> 00:13:02.421
When examining this tweet and question here, we can conclude that this Ruffian is wondering if maybe FUWAMOCO's maine-chan is making some heavy-handed suggestions and telling FUWAMOCO to sing some pretty interesting classic choices.

00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:15.109
You know, with logic that would make sense considering time and age and upbringing heavily influences these sort of things, but there's one big question here.

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:22.888
It's suggesting what content talents make something and Mane-chan do it.

00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:30.751
Well, the answer is, for FUWAMOCO, NO!

00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:36.673
Mane-chan is there to support their crazy thoughts and ideas.

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:39.174
I wonder when that happens, huh?

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:42.055
Crazy thoughts and ideas never happen, huh?

00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:48.800
So, even if you ask Mane-chan what they think, they'll just say, do what you think is best!

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.121
As long as it's okay.

00:13:52.282 --> 00:13:52.803
But no!

00:13:53.143 --> 00:14:01.709
Not even Mane-chan, nor FUWAMOCO's mama puppy, or papa puppy, or grandma puppy, no one can influence their actions!

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:09.854
It's now well documented that FUWAMOCO just have an interesting taste and knowledge when it comes to anime songs and J-pop.

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:10.715
Hm.

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:12.719
Over!

00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:22.226
And our next, we have our popular education acquaintance!

00:14:22.867 --> 00:14:24.788
Please go have fun!

00:14:25.589 --> 00:14:31.794
It's time for Biboo's Japanese Class!

00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:33.715
Yay!

00:14:34.476 --> 00:14:40.421
Today's Japanese is... Kora!

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:43.342
Nametara akan yo!

00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:45.063
Kora!

00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:47.923
Nametara akan yo!

00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:52.964
It means... Beep off!

00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:56.445
Don't underestimate me, you silly head!

00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:03.107
Let's all continue having lots of fun learning Japanese together, okay?

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:05.147
Rock, rock!

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:11.147
Oh no, what's the matter Nerissa?

00:15:11.808 --> 00:15:16.431
I don't know, it's just that recently I've been struggling making thumbnails for streams.

00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:19.033
Like, I don't want to make them anymore.

00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:20.814
I just want to have fun.

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:25.878
No more cutting and pasting and playing around with fonts and colors and angles.

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:27.819
Yeah, I gotchu.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.942
If only there was an easy answer to making thumbnails.

00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:33.804
Oh, are you two having problems?

00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:36.788
Yeah, making thumbnails just suck.

00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:41.033
Well, in that case, I have just the product for you two!

00:15:41.453 --> 00:15:41.573
Oh?

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:42.414
What is it?

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:48.681
Made from 100% professionally aged demon dog, it's Powdered Pero!

00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:51.705
Dried in the musty corners at the bottom of the cell,

00:15:52.205 --> 00:16:01.369
If you stir in around 100 grams into a hot cup of Rat King tea, you can blast them making a bunch of master quality thumbnails even Picasso would be proud of!

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:03.610
Wow, that sounds great!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.711
It sure is!

00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:06.471
Does it just help with thumbnails?

00:16:06.692 --> 00:16:08.192
Yeah, what about side effects?

00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:09.133
Huh?

00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:12.074
Are you implying something, Nerissa?

00:16:12.214 --> 00:16:13.154
No, no, no!

00:16:13.174 --> 00:16:15.916
How did Pero is perfectly safe!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.477
It's no different from an energy drink, I think.

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:20.018
I love you two.

00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:23.419
Why would I ever try to entice you into something questionable, huh?

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.201
As for video editing, you betcha!

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.482
You'll be able to make any movie you want in a flash!

00:16:29.502 --> 00:16:35.105
Vlogs, animation, feature-length films, animal videos.

00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:39.327
It's all possible with just a sip of some tea mixed with powdered Pero!

00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:40.748
It tastes great too!

00:16:41.428 --> 00:16:48.892
You know when you find an old marshmallow on the sofa and you're like, when in the world did I last have marshmallows, huh?

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:53.055
You know, that's exactly the flavor of powdered Pero.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:17:00.259
With a combination of confusion and artificial sweeteners, it only adds to your beverage and enhances your creativity.

00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:01.539
Amazing!

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.141
And the best part, the price!

00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:07.763
All it costs you is... Can you guess?

00:17:09.164 --> 00:17:26.853
Well, normally it would be $149.99 with shipping and handling, but due to a manufacturing error totally not caused by a certain employee called Fuwawa Abyssgard, that new price is something that will never be beaten in multiple, multiple lifetimes.

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:32.115
All it takes is hitting the subscribe button!

00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:35.759
You thought I'd say your smile?

00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:37.242
Well!

00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:42.512
Now that you've hit that button right, I'll make an even better deal for you!

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:44.656
All it costs is...

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.581
Your smile!

00:17:46.981 --> 00:17:48.182
Because I need it.

00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:50.324
It's my duty to protect it.

00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:51.925
You'll give it to me, right?

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:53.367
Absolutely.

00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:55.328
You already had my smile.

00:17:55.649 --> 00:17:58.251
Only now can you get your own Powdered Pero!

00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:06.118
Limited to 1000 grams per pack, Powdered Pero is available now for the next 100 spectator commenters!

00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:10.962
Once today's show ends, it will go back forever in the FUWAMOCO Vault.

00:18:11.362 --> 00:18:12.283
BAU BAU!

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:13.124
BAU BAU!

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:17.510
Wow!

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.375
That was a very cute and heartwarming Japanese lesson from Biboo!

00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:28.901
You know, she'll definitely help us polish up our Japanese skills until they're solid like a rock, huh?

00:18:29.882 --> 00:18:32.865
Powdered Pero too!

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:36.509
Sounds like a good rush of creative inspiration!

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.850
Wow.

00:18:38.905 --> 00:18:41.786
Let's hear what our spectator commenters have to say.

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:43.107
BAU BAU.

00:18:43.727 --> 00:18:44.808
BAU BAU!

00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:45.748
Indeed!

00:18:45.988 --> 00:18:46.609
Need it!

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:48.210
You'll take 20!

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.591
Well, you're just in luck!

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.652
So authentic!

00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:57.434
Yes, Power Pero is only the most authentic!

00:18:58.975 --> 00:19:01.936
Well, let's continue on to more news!

00:19:04.157 --> 00:19:07.039
Our next story is a very exciting one!

00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:13.651
hololive English -Advent- will be revealing their first alternate outfits on January 1st!

00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:15.812
New Year's outfits!

00:19:16.732 --> 00:19:20.574
And that means it's the season of outfit design guessing.

00:19:22.254 --> 00:19:23.615
And despite Ms.

00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:35.039
Mococo announcing that the New Year's outfits are as cute as fundoshi, there has been a serious lack of serious outfit guesses featuring fundoshi themselves.

00:19:37.403 --> 00:19:40.506
Do you not think there's a hundoshi there hiding Ruffians?

00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:50.574
Well, since hundoshi might be new to some Ruffians out there, we ask expert elf for help.

00:19:55.725 --> 00:20:08.787
According to Expert F, fundoshi are a traditional Japanese undergarment that consists of a single strip of cloth and leaves a lot of the behind exposed to the airing gaze.

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:10.408
But!

00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:13.348
It's an important part of Japanese culture!

00:20:13.968 --> 00:20:21.210
It is rather shocking to think that there may be so many who think that a fundoshi may not be included in an outfit design, huh?

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.330
Well!

00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:28.250
Let's turn to hear what our spectator commentators have to say about this.

00:20:30.853 --> 00:20:31.213
Hai.

00:20:32.374 --> 00:20:33.475
Interesting.

00:20:34.476 --> 00:20:35.137
Culture.

00:20:35.197 --> 00:20:35.797
Right.

00:20:36.518 --> 00:20:37.039
Kusa.

00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:39.141
Oh.

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:40.702
Thank you.

00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:40.782
Yes.

00:20:40.963 --> 00:20:41.623
Expert Elf.

00:20:41.743 --> 00:20:42.945
Thank you very much.

00:20:45.107 --> 00:20:46.328
Very important.

00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:46.949
Kusa.

00:20:48.424 --> 00:20:50.465
Thank you, very good comments!

00:20:51.406 --> 00:20:59.612
Well, you'll just have to come see the big reveal yourself starting at 5pm PT, 10am JST.

00:21:00.212 --> 00:21:01.073
BAU BAU!

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:05.276
And here's today's weather report!

00:21:05.676 --> 00:21:07.137
Oh.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:08.458
Gosh.

00:21:09.378 --> 00:21:09.979
This world.

00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:14.173
It looks strangely nostalgic, huh?

00:21:15.253 --> 00:21:18.535
Today's forecast calls for some nostalgic rain showers.

00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:25.598
I think, at this moment in time, everyone is reflecting back on good times!

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:32.840
And hopefully, looking forward to even more new and exciting good times to come to us in the future.

00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:35.321
Well, everyone!

00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:39.283
Soredewa, kyou mo, ohayou gozaimashita!
