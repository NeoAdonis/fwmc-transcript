00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:09.486
Hello Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:13.636
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.724
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:18.887
BAU BAU!

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:25.102
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:26.043 --> 00:05:27.385
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:30.288
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.410
BAU BAU!

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.832
Ruffians!

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:36.815
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.900
Today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.426
Thank you for joining us for our 176th episode!

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:48.267
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.551
Ruffians, you awake?

00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:52.132
Out of bed?

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:55.797
Are you a little bit cold?

00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:58.260
BAU BAU!

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.662
We miss you!

00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:03.587
Good morning!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.549
BAU BAU, you awake?

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:06.310
You think so?

00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:08.833
Good morning!

00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:09.835
It's been what?

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.757
How many hours?

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:16.707
Maybe a little bit longer for Ruffians that have got a full rest.

00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:17.308
Maybe.

00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:26.849
But for Ruffians joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short for that morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:28.572
A.K.A.

00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:28.873
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:32.260
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.406
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:44.111
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:51.197
Please share your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:06:51.898 --> 00:06:55.321
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.723
BAU BAU!

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:02.247
A little scratchy, Moco-chan.

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:06.091
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.994
Well, there's a bunch of things that happened this week, right?

00:07:12.938 --> 00:07:13.579
Yeah.

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:14.480
Scratchy?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.741
No, no.

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:18.665
No FUWAMOCO, right?

00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:23.169
Oh, how's Moco-chan's thumb?

00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.652
Still a bit swollen.

00:07:28.012 --> 00:07:30.515
So much gaming huh, Moco-chan?

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:33.218
It was a bunch of fun!

00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.285
Well, let's start off the week with some brand new news, Moco-chan!

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:41.308
Well... What?

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:46.774
Something almost as spooky as Silent Hill F. Huh?

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:48.776
Because it's autumn?

00:07:49.037 --> 00:07:50.559
Because it's October, Moco-chan?

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:53.462
It was...

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:55.806
Pero Sighting.

00:07:55.826 --> 00:07:56.647
Pero Sighting.

00:07:57.408 --> 00:07:58.429
At least it was that.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.174
Not just something wishy-noshy Moco-chan.

00:08:02.194 --> 00:08:04.957
There was a lot of scary things that happened inside the little elf.

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:09.543
Well, let's see how this compares.

00:08:10.163 --> 00:08:10.984
Let's take a look!

00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:17.372
That sounds very scary.

00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:17.572
Ruffians!

00:08:18.654 --> 00:08:18.934
Ruffians!

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:19.655
Okay.

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:23.179
You approached us down with a bunch of pumpkins.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:28.127
You picked a very familiar looking pumpkin, right?

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.938
No...

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.380
Right!

00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:36.950
Ruffians, you know that's not a pumpkin.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.871
That's Pero.

00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:39.752
You have to be careful, okay?

00:08:39.772 --> 00:08:41.094
Be careful, okay?

00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:43.976
You know there's a lot of different types of pumpkins here.

00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:52.123
Some are orange, lots of orange ones, but some are green, some are white, long, round.

00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:54.345
That isn't a pumpkin.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.167
That's not one of them.

00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:56.848
No.

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:57.869
Yeah.

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:01.052
So, make sure you don't take it home with you, okay?

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:01.672
Ruffians!

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:03.814
Yeah, just leave it be, okay?

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:07.640
No matter what you ask, don't give it any treats, okay?

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:09.963
Not even candy corn.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:10.183
No.

00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:12.046
What?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.112
Not the candy you don't want either, okay?

00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:20.839
Not the pumpkin shaped candy corn either.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:22.561
That one's better though.

00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:22.702
No.

00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:24.765
What if he starves?

00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:26.467
Let him be.

00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:27.048
What if?

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.111
What if he doesn't?

00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:31.314
But what if you're safe?

00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:33.177
I want candy corn.

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:40.429
Just leave it be, okay?

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.151
It won't be just nasty Pero.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.033
Okay?

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:46.278
BAU BAU!

00:09:48.382 --> 00:09:49.424
You have to be careful.

00:09:50.065 --> 00:09:52.188
Comes Christmas, Moco-chan.

00:09:54.492 --> 00:09:57.477
Now think of what kind of costume he's going to be putting on then, huh?

00:09:58.486 --> 00:10:01.410
Now be careful, careful FUWAMOCO!

00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.254
BAU BAU!

00:10:05.556 --> 00:10:05.836
Wow!

00:10:06.317 --> 00:10:12.105
Just over the weekend, there was a very special celebration!

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:18.094
hololive English Promise had their second anniversary!

00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:18.274
BAU BAU!

00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:20.377
But they also had a special announcement!

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:25.945
They released a brand new original song called Run Back Round!

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:27.811
BAU BAU!

00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:31.744
It's a very refreshing and optimistic tune with...

00:10:31.825 --> 00:10:35.918
I feel like it feels a bit nostalgic.

00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.404
Have you listened?

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:41.287
It's a banger!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.890
You love it!

00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.034
That's so cool!

00:10:47.054 --> 00:10:49.338
Right now there's no video at the moment.

00:10:49.378 --> 00:10:55.105
You'll have to take a look at their live performance of it during their 2nd anniversary.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:58.149
You get to see the really cool choreography they have.

00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:01.534
It almost makes you want to dance along too.

00:11:01.514 --> 00:11:05.942
I'm sure they'll have a very cool MV out soon, so let's look forward to that too!

00:11:06.203 --> 00:11:10.591
And in the meantime, you can listen to it on streaming services!

00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:11.814
So go check it out!

00:11:11.974 --> 00:11:15.280
Run background on Spotify as well!

00:11:17.264 --> 00:11:18.567
BAU BAU!

00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:19.849
Happy 2nd anniversary, promise!

00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:21.292
Please check it out, Ruffians!

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:23.556
BAU BAU!

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.500
Oh wow!

00:11:25.961 --> 00:11:28.304
There's also another big celebration.

00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:34.112
A big milestone that happened just the other day!

00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:34.252
Zetta!

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:40.881
She hit 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:41.201
Yeah!

00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:41.842
Zetta-senpai, congratulations!

00:11:41.862 --> 00:11:42.283
Oh Zetta!

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:46.769
Of course, Irene, she hit 1 million subscribers!

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:50.033
It's an amazing feat by Moco-chan!

00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:55.858
And she was able to do a countdown stream just in time before she hit the big milestone too!

00:11:55.878 --> 00:11:58.140
It's pretty tricky, huh?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.743
Just in time to do an ASMR!

00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:06.308
She showed up and then all of a sudden...

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:06.668
I have 1 million!

00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:06.848
BAU BAU!

00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:07.029
BAU BAU!

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:07.149
Yeah!

00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:13.915
And you know, she was thinking a lot... Maybe about her 1 million wish.

00:12:15.737 --> 00:12:15.797
Oh!

00:12:15.817 --> 00:12:19.300
I know, we've been thinking a lot about our 1 million.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:19.480
Yeah!

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:21.273
Quite a while.

00:12:22.094 --> 00:12:23.856
But I wonder what she's gonna use it on, huh?

00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:27.081
Your outfit?

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.902
Maybe.

00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:43.582
But actually, I thought it was kind of interesting because it was exactly one year ago that we hit 1 million subscribers too!

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:44.063
It was our anniversary!

00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:44.944
And Zettou-senpai and I

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:50.730
BAU BAU!

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.536
One year since then.

00:12:54.556 --> 00:13:01.506
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for continuing on this journey with us and for letting us protect your smiles.

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:05.112
We're looking forward to many more milestones together with you two!

00:13:05.753 --> 00:13:07.876
BAU BAU!

00:13:08.317 --> 00:13:09.599
Thank you!

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.024
And speaking of milestones...

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:14.824
Oh?

00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:15.946
Wow!

00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:18.590
Another milestone happened!

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:22.957
Our cover of White Love hit 2 million views on YouTube!

00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:26.463
Thank you Ruffians!

00:13:26.483 --> 00:13:29.348
BAU BAU!

00:13:29.368 --> 00:13:32.633
Wow, White Love won all of a sudden.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.456
It's been a while now, we released it back in December of 2023.

00:13:36.576 --> 00:13:39.822
Where does the time go right?

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.428
It's a classic song by the 90's idol group SPEED.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:50.841
It's a very sad and almost in a winter song, but I feel like it's also very powerful.

00:13:50.821 --> 00:14:10.180
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.083
One of our best covers!

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:16.507
BAU BAU!

00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:16.927
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:14:16.987 --> 00:14:18.910
I feel like we were just waking on it the other day.

00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:19.912
Why?

00:14:20.452 --> 00:14:21.394
Very confusing.

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:23.276
BAU time.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.722
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:29.185
We'll continue to do our best to sing lots and lots.

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:32.330
At least maybe more covers.

00:14:35.695 --> 00:14:37.197
BAU BAU!

00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:41.756
You know, we always do our best on our music.

00:14:42.977 --> 00:14:46.740
For us, our music is really important even if it's a cover song.

00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:49.523
Of course, if it's an original song.

00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:52.266
We'd be really happy if you could support us by listening to it.

00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:55.809
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:14:58.973 --> 00:14:59.133
BAU BAU!

00:15:00.254 --> 00:15:00.454
And!

00:15:01.115 --> 00:15:03.437
A big announcement was made about

00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:06.001
hololive Super Expo and hololive Fest!

00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:08.144
Did you hear the news, Ruffians?

00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:08.264
Yeah!

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:09.726
Oh?

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:11.449
Wow!

00:15:13.953 --> 00:15:14.093
De-den!

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:16.917
hololive Fest!

00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:20.562
7th hololive Fest is the official title that was now announced.

00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:23.387
We have hololive Super Expo 2026.

00:15:23.687 --> 00:15:24.709
Makes sense.

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:30.878
And hololive 7th Fest "Ridin'on Dreams"!

00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:31.078
Yeah!

00:15:31.058 --> 00:15:33.043
I'm so excited!

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:36.692
But this year, you know, it's nice to have a title and everything.

00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:41.524
But the dates... Ruffians, are you ready with the calendar?

00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:42.984
Make sure you write it down, okay?

00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:53.396
In 2026, it will be happening on March 6th, March 7th, and March 8th!

00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:54.077
Three days!

00:15:54.097 --> 00:15:55.038
That's the first time ever!

00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:59.763
Three days of hololive Super Expo at best as well!

00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:00.945
Are you ready?

00:16:02.146 --> 00:16:02.627
Are you ready?

00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:06.891
I'm ready!

00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:07.072
BAU BAU!

00:16:07.412 --> 00:16:08.193
March 7th!

00:16:08.293 --> 00:16:09.254
Yeah, March 7th!

00:16:09.634 --> 00:16:10.195
March...

00:16:10.934 --> 00:16:12.337
6th and 8th, yes.

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:13.559
All of them.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.243
6th, 7th, and 8th, yes!

00:16:15.644 --> 00:16:18.971
You need to train your arms right, Ruffians!

00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:25.785
It's gonna be an intense three days, so, but let's make it AMAZING!

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:30.715
Last year, or last year, this year, it was our first fest!

00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:34.743
What if you don't know what Fes and Expo are?

00:16:34.763 --> 00:16:38.030
Expo is a big event the hololive that we all put on.

00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:39.734
There's a bunch of different things.

00:16:39.794 --> 00:16:46.989
Exhibitions, games, cosplay area, a lot going on.

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:50.155
Special programming, food too.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:55.803
Yes, that is the big concert that we all worked so hard to prepare.

00:16:56.464 --> 00:16:58.286
We put our heart and souls into.

00:16:58.326 --> 00:17:03.653
And all of us, all of us at hololive, we're on that big stage there.

00:17:04.094 --> 00:17:14.188
So we hope that you can maybe come and cheer us on, whether it's at Makuhari Messe or online with the streaming ticket.

00:17:14.788 --> 00:17:17.492
We'd love to have you cheer for us!

00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:20.776
It's Wrestle May.

00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:23.800
I don't know what that is, but that sounds cool.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.041
Maybe.

00:17:28.265 --> 00:17:29.547
Why don't we collaborate?

00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:32.050
You know, a bit of both.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.333
I don't think there's gonna be any wrestling this year.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:35.915
Somehow I doubt it.

00:17:35.975 --> 00:17:37.917
It's not wrestling on dreams, Moco-chan.

00:17:38.698 --> 00:17:40.240
Ridin'on Dreams.

00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:47.077
We know that three days this year means it'll be even bigger and better!

00:17:47.998 --> 00:17:48.679
Maybe.

00:17:48.699 --> 00:17:50.823
And maybe Justice will be joining us too!

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:52.345
That would be cool.

00:17:53.347 --> 00:17:53.968
One can hope.

00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:56.432
Swimsuits!

00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:00.138
That's too much dreams now, okay?

00:18:01.259 --> 00:18:01.800
No.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.723
Yeah, maybe not Ruffians.

00:18:03.944 --> 00:18:05.707
No, not that dream.

00:18:06.528 --> 00:18:07.710
Yeah.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.830
Okay?

00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:11.906
BAU BAU!

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:15.150
I can't wait!

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:15.350
Sighting.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.672
Hope to see you there, Ruffians!

00:18:18.773 --> 00:18:21.596
Well, there's some funny stuff going on.

00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:25.660
The other day, I'm sure you saw two Ruffians.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.001
First of all, Ruffians.

00:18:28.303 --> 00:18:33.308
How would you react if we just tweeted, Ruffians, I need you.

00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:33.748
Huh?

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.632
Would you be confused?

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:39.114
That would be confusing.

00:18:39.977 --> 00:18:40.278
Huh?

00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:40.419
Yeah.

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:43.651
Oh?

00:18:43.671 --> 00:18:46.221
Well, Abyss, what do you wish for?

00:18:47.028 --> 00:18:51.472
Nerissa caused a little bit of a disturbance.

00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:52.894
Disturbance.

00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:54.736
A panic between everyone.

00:18:55.256 --> 00:18:56.818
And I don't know why it was disturbing.

00:18:56.858 --> 00:19:00.862
I don't know why it was panicking because it should be understandable.

00:19:00.882 --> 00:19:05.466
To some people, there was some suspicious behavior going on on Nerissa's account.

00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:08.369
If FUWAMOCO tweeted this, yes, that would be weird.

00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:16.157
But Nerissa, Nerissa started tweeting every member of hololive's name along with a, I need you.

00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:18.733
Every single member.

00:19:19.414 --> 00:19:19.775
JP.

00:19:20.816 --> 00:19:20.916
ARIN.

00:19:21.737 --> 00:19:21.897
IAN.

00:19:22.317 --> 00:19:22.998
The voice.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.062
Why did I think she said I love you?

00:19:27.704 --> 00:19:28.945
Moco-chan, that's not what she said.

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:30.627
I thought she said that!

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.592
Normal Nerissa thinks right.

00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:35.653
Yeah.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.835
The FUWAMOCO.

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:39.057
This is very normal.

00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:41.199
We are right there and ready.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:43.562
For Nerissa.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.772
Yeah.

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:47.657
But there's a lot of different reactions.

00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:53.689
Some members thinking you know that her cat was compromised.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.098
Some members upset that she was cheating on them.

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:01.585
They wanted to be the only ones to hear these words.

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:04.300
No.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.424
Nerissa just has a lot of love to give, right?

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.347
It's understandable.

00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:13.012
It's typical Nerissa.

00:20:13.032 --> 00:20:13.452
Ha!

00:20:13.472 --> 00:20:13.653
Ruffians!

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.156
Deeper is so confused.

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:17.217
Maybe a little bit.

00:20:17.418 --> 00:20:18.519
It's not that confusing.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.641
No!

00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:21.543
Don't think about it that deeply and it's fine.

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:23.726
Big heart.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.814
Moco-chan, why did you think Nerissa said I love you though?

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:31.977
Because it basically means the same.

00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.636
That's Chiyo.

00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:36.579
She loves everybody at hololive.

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:40.006
BAU BAU!

00:20:40.026 --> 00:20:41.869
Typical needy Nerissa.

00:20:44.414 --> 00:20:52.950
But you know, it's nice to know that even though it's getting chillier with autumn and everything, Nerissa still has a lot of warmth to provide us.

00:20:53.811 --> 00:20:54.252
Yeah.

00:20:55.345 --> 00:20:58.430
BAU BAU!

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.331
BAU BAU!

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:00.272
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:03.017
It's the beginning of a brand new week!

00:21:03.037 --> 00:21:05.000
It was a fun weekend, but...

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.201
But things getting cold.

00:21:06.241 --> 00:21:09.526
It's now officially the season where it's hard to get out of bed.

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:13.232
Moco-chan.

00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:18.300
Well, did you wanna pup talk?

00:21:19.882 --> 00:21:21.705
Huh?

00:21:21.725 --> 00:21:21.825
Yeah.

00:21:25.062 --> 00:21:26.264
Okay.

00:21:30.471 --> 00:21:31.873
BAU BAU!

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:34.577
Ruffians!

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.482
Ruffians!

00:21:38.444 --> 00:21:39.926
It's that time again!

00:21:40.747 --> 00:21:43.592
It's time for a FUWAMOCO Pup Talk!

00:21:44.573 --> 00:21:47.078
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:48.660
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:50.263 --> 00:21:51.745
Ruffians!

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:54.089
It's October!

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.652
It's official, okay.

00:21:57.495 --> 00:22:00.300
Has it been a bit colder recently?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.283
I know.

00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:06.791
I know it can be hard to get out of bed and get going for the day.

00:22:07.713 --> 00:22:13.142
But the faster you spring out of bed and take control of the day, the better!

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.737
You'll thank yourself for the fast action.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.022
Got it!

00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:23.967
And before you know it, your body and your heart will be all warmed and ready to take on anything!

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:25.292
Okay!

00:22:26.453 --> 00:22:31.057
You don't know, it feels like the fall and the winter cold will last forever.

00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:33.760
Just remember that BAU time exists!

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.942
And we'll be back to the spring before we know it, okay?

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.225
Let's do this together!

00:22:39.965 --> 00:22:41.166
BAU BAU!

00:22:41.907 --> 00:22:43.088
Ganbatte ne!

00:22:43.168 --> 00:22:44.309
BAU BAU!

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.993
BAU BAU Moco-chan!

00:22:49.814 --> 00:22:50.655
Ganbatte ne!

00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:52.096
Maybe...

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:55.279
Sorry, I held to go a bit of a...

00:22:56.744 --> 00:23:10.483
Bye-bye!

00:23:11.358 --> 00:23:15.469
Wow, let's doggy use the Doggie of the Day today, huh?

00:23:15.489 --> 00:23:24.632
Doggie of the Day we have... Today's Doggie of the Day is Tsukune-kun Mama!

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.422
Look at her big ears!

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:31.126
Smile!

00:23:31.366 --> 00:23:37.394
Look at the socks too, Moco-chan!

00:23:37.414 --> 00:23:38.896
Tsukune-kun, such a happy boy!

00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:42.461
A happy boy who loves to eat too!

00:23:43.402 --> 00:23:44.123
Makes sense.

00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:45.445
Happy boys love to eat.

00:23:47.768 --> 00:23:51.473
How does Tsukune-kun BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

00:23:51.453 --> 00:23:54.437
Au revoir!

00:23:54.457 --> 00:23:55.919
So happy!

00:23:55.939 --> 00:23:56.139
Au revoir!

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.024
Very very happy bau bau.

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:05.511
Well, I think we can tell right from this photo here.

00:24:05.952 --> 00:24:10.518
He's the best boy you could ever wish to have by your side.

00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:12.140
Always ready to play.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.162
Always ready to go for a walk.

00:24:15.064 --> 00:24:17.487
Just wants to be next to you.

00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:19.249
What are you straight for?

00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:36.635
Today I went on a walk.

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:49.152
Let's see, where did we go for a walk today?

00:24:49.486 --> 00:24:51.096
De-den!

00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:55.243
Autumn fireworks!

00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:58.232
Amazing!

00:24:58.252 --> 00:24:59.354
It looks like purple!

00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:00.356
It looks like a heart.

00:25:01.037 --> 00:25:02.761
Like a heart or a jellyfish!

00:25:03.883 --> 00:25:06.367
Wow, so beautiful!

00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:10.274
We're glad you're able to go with your family too!

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.659
We got to come along as well!

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:18.750
FUWAMOCO, have we ever watched Violet?

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.353
Not in the autumn.

00:25:20.671 --> 00:25:24.518
You know autumn fireworks in the summer time, ya?

00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:26.381
But not too much really.

00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:27.843
I feel like autumn is sort of rare.

00:25:28.645 --> 00:25:29.727
But it would be nice.

00:25:29.747 --> 00:25:32.011
These are so pretty.

00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.395
We're glad you had a nice time.

00:25:34.936 --> 00:25:37.700
BAU BAU!

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:39.023
Thank you!

00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:42.329
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:45.514
Today's Question of the Day is...

00:25:45.494 --> 00:25:46.815
De-den!

00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:49.639
Spooky season is upon us, so...

00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:54.944
I know you're a powerful team of guide dogs, but what sends shivers down your spines?

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:56.546
Ghosts?

00:25:56.566 --> 00:25:57.247
Spiders?

00:25:57.307 --> 00:25:58.368
Vampires?

00:25:58.388 --> 00:25:59.730
Or something else?

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.495
Spiders is more or less... Ruffians, what do you think the answer is, huh?

00:26:05.977 --> 00:26:07.599
Spiders aren't spooky.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.361
Important question.

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:13.425
Yeah, not... nothing.

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:19.002
I don't know about that.

00:26:19.022 --> 00:26:19.302
Onions?

00:26:19.322 --> 00:26:20.103
Pearl?

00:26:20.123 --> 00:26:23.489
We're not scared of Pearl, right Moco-chan?

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:24.550
No.

00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:27.074
No?

00:26:27.094 --> 00:26:27.294
No.

00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:31.982
What?

00:26:32.002 --> 00:26:32.923
What do you think?

00:26:33.023 --> 00:26:34.586
I don't know.

00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.530
We didn't even go on dogs!

00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.134
We're getting stronger too, right Moco-chan?

00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:41.877
We're not scared of heights!

00:26:44.388 --> 00:26:45.029
Not really.

00:26:45.469 --> 00:26:46.651
A reasonable level?

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:48.153
We're not scary cats.

00:26:48.193 --> 00:26:50.436
We're strong demon guard dogs.

00:26:51.317 --> 00:26:52.819
But maybe all of those, you know?

00:26:53.199 --> 00:26:57.665
I think anything that's surprising and kinda scary...

00:26:59.027 --> 00:26:59.627
Right?

00:26:59.647 --> 00:27:00.529
That doesn't right?

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.053
If anything was to jump all at me, that would be enough.

00:27:04.073 --> 00:27:05.575
Even my shadow scares me sometimes.

00:27:06.076 --> 00:27:07.678
Yeah.

00:27:07.698 --> 00:27:07.898
Yeah.

00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:09.573
Loud noises?

00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:10.914
Oh.

00:27:10.934 --> 00:27:11.575
Very much so.

00:27:11.615 --> 00:27:14.477
Some washing machine noises.

00:27:16.099 --> 00:27:17.140
All the time, right?

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.081
Not me.

00:27:19.001 --> 00:27:19.802
FUWAMOCO-san.

00:27:19.822 --> 00:27:19.902
Huh?

00:27:20.163 --> 00:27:21.884
What do you mean not you, Moco-chan?

00:27:21.904 --> 00:27:23.265
Not because I'm aware of it.

00:27:24.386 --> 00:27:25.808
You're always scared of it.

00:27:25.868 --> 00:27:26.548
No I'm not.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.772
The answer is more or less anything.

00:27:31.473 --> 00:27:32.554
Yeah.

00:27:32.574 --> 00:27:34.115
Just something.

00:27:34.136 --> 00:27:36.838
But we're getting stronger, right, Moco-chan?

00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:44.069
Thank you Ruffians!

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:45.531

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:57.631

00:28:01.738 --> 00:28:03.180
Especino...

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.264
The fall season, maybe going on some nice walks?

00:28:06.824 --> 00:28:09.167
Please share that with us, okay?

00:28:13.272 --> 00:28:13.432

00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:15.614

00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:21.401
And wow, for Ruffians joining us in the archives, FUWAMOCO's word is...

00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:23.183
It's BAU BAU, all the lives!

00:28:23.523 --> 00:28:26.907

00:28:26.887 --> 00:28:32.583

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:39.262
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:40.787
