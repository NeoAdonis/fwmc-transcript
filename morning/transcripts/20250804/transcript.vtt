00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:10.291
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:14.646
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:19.504
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:25.646
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.949
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:31.053
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:04:31.073 --> 00:04:32.795
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:38.322
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:42.387
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 168th

00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:48.253
Episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:49.175
BAU BAU!

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:49.575
Good morning!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.982
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, Ruffians!

00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:57.465
Nice to see you!

00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:58.166
Miss you!

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:00.830
BAU BAU!

00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:02.472
Good morning!

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:03.713
Good morning!

00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:09.741
I'm nice and refreshed and ready for a new week, Ruffians!

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:14.623
Maybe there's a lot of Ruffians who are confused.

00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:17.029
There's nothing confusing about it!

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:18.272
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:24.608
But those who are joining us for the first time today!

00:05:25.448 --> 00:05:32.938
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.078
A.K.A.

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:33.278
FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:34.820
And it's hosted by us!

00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:37.023
FUWAMOCO!

00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:43.691
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.273
Yeah!

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:46.715
And there's a good reason for that.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:48.958
So that we can get a bit more balanced.

00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:55.788
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:02.158
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:05.783
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:09.129
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.012
Are you on the wrong timeline?

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:19.266
No you're not because you're awake, bright, and early for a new day, a new week, and a new month because you know now it's August.

00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:20.308
What?

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.413
August is a fun month.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.799
There's lots of fun things going on.

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:29.323
Moco-chan you big August hater.

00:06:29.303 --> 00:06:39.282
Ruffians, are you August haters too?

00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:41.225
Ruffian what?

00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:43.389
Ruffian what?

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.892
Ruffian what?

00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:45.393
What?

00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:49.000
That's it, the voice is speaking?

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:55.688
FUWAMOCO-chan, you know, August is here and that means there's a lot of fun things happening, right?

00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:00.196
Ruffians, have you been having a lot of fun together with us?

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:06.787
Maybe, you know, you've been a little bit busy with this and that, work, school, you know?

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:09.832
Maybe even going bowling or something cool, right?

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:11.935
Bowling's pretty cool too.

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:14.700
I don't know which is better.

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:19.166
Let's take a look at what's been going on, Moco-chan!

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:26.357
This is not better than... Moco-chan, why are you kind of hesitating like that?

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:27.999
It's not better than bowling.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.081
Did something happen?

00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:29.922
Or boarding.

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:32.826
What is it then?

00:07:32.846 --> 00:07:35.090
If it's not bowling, it's not boarding.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.091
Similar.

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:38.735
Similar to bowling.

00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:40.738
You could probably try bowling, but...

00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:42.510
Another Pero Sighting.

00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:44.854
A Pero Sighting?

00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:45.735
What?

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:48.079
How is a Pero Sighting similar to Bowling or Bowling?

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.682
Bowling, you know, Pero is round.

00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:52.866
It's good, but it's kind of weak.

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:54.588
I don't, I, maybe not to me.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.275
Okay, well, let's take a look at my Pero Sighting, Dad.

00:08:00.016 --> 00:08:00.657
Let's take a look.

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:02.380
Dad.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.842
Dad!

00:08:04.263 --> 00:08:04.443
Oh!

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.831
This is a happy scene, but... What?

00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:12.394
We look closely at Pero there.

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:16.060
He doesn't really look as nasty as usual.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.580
Oh, you're right.

00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:19.004
He kinda looks a little proud.

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:22.249
Yeah, he sort of has like a warm aura around him.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:23.391
Yeah, he's kinda strange.

00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:24.673
You know, love fans.

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:27.096
Sneaky.

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:30.221
And looking a bit huggable.

00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:39.295
Maybe, you know, maybe somehow he can feel all the love and the passion that the love fans have for us.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.943
I need him a little fluffier.

00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:45.751
A little bit nasty just for this small moment in time.

00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.514
A little less nasty, yeah.

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.200
I need something nasty, are you sure?

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.202
Are you sure?

00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:55.731
I don't know, he looks really proud and like, oh yeah, Ruffians.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.723
Okay, you're okay.

00:08:57.743 --> 00:08:58.164
No!

00:08:58.706 --> 00:08:59.267
No!

00:08:59.347 --> 00:09:04.799
Maybe that's the way to make Pero... In front of this beautiful, beautiful flower stand.

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:08.166
Maybe you can make him not so nasty like this, huh?

00:09:08.187 --> 00:09:08.688
Passion?

00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:10.432
Maybe.

00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:13.398
Maybe that's the way to stop Pero Ruffians.

00:09:15.563 --> 00:09:15.643
Huh?

00:09:16.113 --> 00:09:16.874
Wow!

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:21.438
Thank you for the start of the world tour!

00:09:21.558 --> 00:09:21.799
I'm Ruffian!

00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:22.659
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:09:22.719 --> 00:09:24.461
Thank you for all your messages!

00:09:25.142 --> 00:09:34.491
Of course, for stans, Itabags, cute cosplayers, and your big BAU BAUs.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:34.911
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:09:34.931 --> 00:09:35.092
BAU BAU!

00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:36.993
I feel happy now.

00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:38.935
That's kind of a rare feeling, huh?

00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:41.017
Not so nasty, Pero Sighting?

00:09:41.718 --> 00:09:45.782
No, you know, because I can feel the Ruffians' love.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.024
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.084 --> 00:09:49.425
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:52.149
But we're gonna quick quick quick quick change.

00:09:52.489 --> 00:09:53.811
Here is your Ruffians.

00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:58.298
I don't wanna have to say this Moco-chan.

00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:03.486
Ruffians.

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:08.213
We have an apology to make.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:13.221
It's a pretty serious one.

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:17.208
I think some of you maybe know of it.

00:10:19.713 --> 00:10:23.801
A big mistake occurred.

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:28.269
That has occurred on our own channel of all places.

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:37.167
Last week, Cecilia and Gigi.

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:41.870
They ended up taking over FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:43.672
I know, Ruffians!

00:10:44.132 --> 00:10:45.034
What the heck!

00:10:46.015 --> 00:10:49.439
They made a CCGG Morning!

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:52.743
I'm so sorry, Ruffians.

00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:58.270
You know, we were sad and disgusted.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.673
Traumatized even.

00:11:01.632 --> 00:11:02.613
It was scary.

00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:04.615
Yeah.

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:08.059
You didn't notice a difference.

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.802
We did, but the damage was already done.

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:13.925
You didn't notice a difference.

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:14.085
Uh-huh.

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:14.666
I get blind.

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:20.132
Well, we understand, you know.

00:11:20.172 --> 00:11:22.754
There were a lot of strange things discussed.

00:11:25.157 --> 00:11:27.900
Do you think they were censored properly?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.180
I don't know.

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:45.662
I'm Fuwawa!

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.768
I'm waiting.

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:06.474
I'm waiting!

00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.959
I'm Mococo!

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:12.002
She is Mococo!

00:12:12.022 --> 00:12:15.366
And together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.889
You know it's right!

00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:24.638
Don't be sad, okay?

00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:24.919
Don't be sad.

00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:25.960
I'm so in love with you!

00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:35.521
You know, I promise you, from here on out, that nobody other than FUWAMOCO will be here doing FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:35.621
Yes.

00:12:36.162 --> 00:12:37.224
No guests.

00:12:37.244 --> 00:12:37.745
Nothing.

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:38.887
No.

00:12:38.907 --> 00:12:39.087
No.

00:12:39.407 --> 00:12:39.848
Nobody.

00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:40.830
Just FUWAMOCO.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.972
No surprises.

00:12:42.092 --> 00:12:42.833
Got that?

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:44.796
Yeah?

00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:46.419
Yeah, that would be best, right?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:53.550
Yeah.

00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:06.847

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>

00:13:31.094 --> 00:13:35.980
Um, maybe an apology.

00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:48.354
An apology about the entirety of a certain collab string that happened with La+-senpai and Nerissa.

00:13:48.955 --> 00:13:49.736
That's all we'll say.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.039
A certain off collab.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:54.081
A certain off collab.

00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:56.847
Certain events transpired.

00:13:56.867 --> 00:14:03.640
We were there to help do the collabs, translators, and moral support.

00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:09.232
Because you know, Nerissa, she's still doing her best to learn Japanese.

00:14:09.252 --> 00:14:12.558
And I think we were terrific moral support.

00:14:12.578 --> 00:14:14.382
I won't apologize for that.

00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:23.443
But then something suddenly changed and we became involved in it because Lapu-senpai, she needed a break.

00:14:23.603 --> 00:14:24.445
A break?

00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.392
I think she needed to catch her breath a bit.

00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:34.034
But, we must say, it was educational for those involved.

00:14:34.294 --> 00:14:39.219
Yeah, lots of Japanese learning!

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.044
And, FUWAMOCO, we have something to confess too, right Moco-chan?

00:14:44.164 --> 00:14:44.644
Confession.

00:14:47.507 --> 00:14:48.668
You want a confession?

00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:55.675
Don't be scared.

00:14:58.152 --> 00:14:58.813
Wow!

00:14:59.574 --> 00:15:00.815
Nerissa!

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:03.839
She did not hit us once.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:04.560
No.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:04.981
No.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:05.922
She wouldn't!

00:15:06.543 --> 00:15:06.803
No!

00:15:06.883 --> 00:15:07.644
Yeah.

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:10.187
So, instead she hit herself.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.092
And she was all sorts of red afterwards.

00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:15.153
Yeah.

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:16.555
Yeah.

00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:17.997
Yeah.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:18.798
No way!

00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:20.140
No way!

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:20.380
No way!

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.302
Yeah.

00:15:22.442 --> 00:15:23.043
Yeah.

00:15:23.063 --> 00:15:23.263
Yeah.

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:24.044
She won it.

00:15:24.064 --> 00:15:25.225
No.

00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:25.525
What?

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:36.437
La+-senpai on the other hand, she begged for her to be actually hit, so... I guess she got what she wanted.

00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:38.179
La+-senpai on the other hand, not so much.

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:39.240
Yeah.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.602
She got what she wanted.

00:15:40.642 --> 00:15:44.646
And I guess we all kind of did end up...

00:15:45.352 --> 00:15:48.096
Huh?

00:15:48.116 --> 00:15:48.637
Yeah.

00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:53.584
And you know, a lot of Japanese was taught with... I guess some English too.

00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:54.486
Yeah, you know.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:59.794
Rappoi-senpai, she knew some of the words Nerissa was saying and we asked her right away.

00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:00.354
Yeah.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:01.216
I'm surprised.

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:03.980
And we also wrote up this script here.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.043
You know, with Rappoi-senpai about...

00:16:06.023 --> 00:16:08.986
30 minutes beforehand.

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:13.772
Yeah, we just wanted her to be happy as well, you know, as all the other hololive listeners as well.

00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:20.319
It was a very nice bonding experience that transcends languages and cultures.

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:25.765
Ruppoi-senpai, how about this?

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:26.806
That's great.

00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:31.051
Write that one down.

00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:32.953
That's very gross.

00:16:32.973 --> 00:16:34.495
Ruppoi-senpai, what about this one?

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:42.089
Yeah, but, you know, all the staff and staff and manager, they said it was great!

00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:42.209
Yeah!

00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:48.597
But, the pleasant part, she did seem to run home pretty fast after.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.282
Maybe she was a bit embarrassed?

00:16:52.322 --> 00:16:52.723
Maybe?

00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:54.525
Maybe?

00:16:54.944 --> 00:17:16.865
We hope everyone enjoyed it and had a silly time with us!

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:18.488
BAU BAU!

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:43.817
BAU BAU!

00:17:44.573 --> 00:17:47.200
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:49.305 --> 00:18:01.857
We just celebrated our second anniversary!

00:18:01.837 --> 00:18:04.001
De-den!

00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:11.293
We had a very special Seki Anniversary celebration stream!

00:18:11.313 --> 00:18:14.018
We did it in 3D full body!

00:18:14.038 --> 00:18:19.247
In a brand new 3D self booth!

00:18:19.427 --> 00:18:22.933
It was so much fun!

00:18:22.913 --> 00:18:44.365
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:47.009
Put our paws on things like this.

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:50.835
In case you didn't know, Ruffians, it's different than, you know, the regular studio technology.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.317
This is a different technology.

00:18:52.377 --> 00:18:53.679
Different.

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.401
The 3D self-studio.

00:18:55.421 --> 00:18:56.102
Yeah.

00:18:56.122 --> 00:18:58.386
So, we're really, really happy.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:01.591
It's a place, you know, it's still being worked on further.

00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:06.318
But we hope we can have more silly 3D streams together in the future.

00:19:06.338 --> 00:19:07.399
We're really impressed.

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:11.365
Yeah, with the 3D for body tracking and everything.

00:19:11.345 --> 00:19:15.631
That pose Yamako-chan is extra silly.

00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:17.213
I was testing it.

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:20.137
It's new technology, you have to test it.

00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:25.424
But it was really fun.

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:32.855
And we also announced something that we were working hard on for a long time and very excited to share with you.

00:19:35.358 --> 00:19:41.166
I'm very glad FUWAMOCO produced second anniversary celebration merchandise!

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:41.656
Yeah!

00:19:42.277 --> 00:20:12.283
FUWAMOCO Evening shirt.

00:20:12.263 --> 00:20:31.183
We're very picky about the design.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.415
This would be beautifully paired together with a happy puppy.

00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:39.798
Happy too!

00:20:39.818 --> 00:20:41.139
We're gonna jump out of the shirt!

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:41.940
We're gonna jump out of the shirt!

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.562
BAU BAU!

00:20:43.582 --> 00:20:46.906
And next we have the Pero on the Brain Cap.

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:51.312
I think this one we're most excited to see you wearing, Ruffians!

00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:52.593
We already tried it on.

00:20:53.455 --> 00:20:55.938
Moco-chan looks super adorable in it.

00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:58.521
It was really nice and soft and not hot at all.

00:20:58.541 --> 00:20:59.202
Not at all.

00:20:59.222 --> 00:21:00.343
It was really light.

00:21:00.323 --> 00:21:13.241
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:18.028
Have a howl of a day!

00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:24.299
And we have the FUWAMOCO donut question!

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:28.405
It's in the shape of my favorite donut, a pon-dori!

00:21:28.425 --> 00:21:32.993
And so one side is Fuwawa and one side is Mococo!

00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:36.579
So it does kind of mean that you can't see us both at the same time.

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:41.367
But they are a bit on the big side because I thought that was

00:21:42.022 --> 00:21:44.805
You know, that way you can hug them, you can sleep.

00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:47.589
Or you can put them on your sofa too.

00:21:47.609 --> 00:21:49.170
It's the perfect size.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.492
Do not sit on us.

00:21:51.653 --> 00:21:54.236
Oh no, Ruffians are gonna sit on us now, Moco-chan.

00:21:55.938 --> 00:21:57.300
Don't.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:57.901
BAU BAU!

00:21:57.921 --> 00:22:00.944
And... We have a voice bug!

00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:03.327
This one's a very special situation.

00:22:03.788 --> 00:22:06.891
Can't cafe deal with FUWAMOCO.

00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:08.333
So yeah.

00:22:08.532 --> 00:22:13.178
We kind of go a little crazy when it comes to cats.

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:17.503
Please stick it out here!

00:22:17.523 --> 00:22:18.244
It's in English and Japanese too!

00:22:18.264 --> 00:22:18.505
There it is!

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.128
And we have the Fufufu Adventure Mat here.

00:22:21.148 --> 00:22:27.096
This is the first time we've ever had like a big, beautiful design of Icomochi-mama that's a desk mat!

00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:30.180
And it also works for TCG as well!

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.725
Yeah, so please stick it out!

00:22:34.745 --> 00:22:36.868
Icomochi-mama's love.

00:22:36.848 --> 00:22:44.040
Mocomoco-chan, you hugging me like that is surprising me.

00:22:44.594 --> 00:22:46.676
BAU BAU!

00:22:46.696 --> 00:22:47.076
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:53.322
If you wanna know where you can get your paws on them, you can get them on the official hololive shop in the link below!

00:22:53.382 --> 00:22:55.083
They're on pre-order right now!

00:22:55.484 --> 00:22:57.926
Up until, I think, the beginning of September!

00:22:58.306 --> 00:23:00.848
So please get your paws on them now, okay?

00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:03.851
BAU BAU!

00:23:03.931 --> 00:23:04.431
Thank you!

00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:08.835
But that is not it for our Advent celebration!

00:23:08.855 --> 00:23:09.236
No, no, no, no, no!

00:23:09.256 --> 00:23:09.596
We also had!

00:23:09.616 --> 00:23:11.738
We released a brand new song!

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:14.280
Lifetime Showtime!

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.685
Lifetime Showtime!

00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:19.508
It's a very, very precious song to us.

00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:21.671
You might remember Ruffians.

00:23:21.972 --> 00:23:27.880
We actually shared it with you for the first time on the very day we debuted two years ago.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:32.127
The song is an introduction song written by Suo Patra.

00:23:32.147 --> 00:23:34.310
Patra-oneechan.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.014
She's a very talented Vtuber.

00:23:37.034 --> 00:23:38.256
Very ASMR goddess.

00:23:38.276 --> 00:23:40.259
She's really talented at making music.

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:41.241
She loves retro games.

00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:42.883
She's very cute.

00:23:42.863 --> 00:23:48.789
But this song, it introduces you to exactly who we are, you know, because we are twins.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.212
But we are a little bit different.

00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:53.635
I love FUWAMOCO-chan's fuzzy.

00:23:53.655 --> 00:23:54.095
Yes!

00:23:54.135 --> 00:23:54.596
Introduce both of us!

00:23:54.876 --> 00:23:59.521
And finally we're able to share the full version of Lifetime Showtime with you!

00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:05.968
This time with this beautiful animated music video!

00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:06.509
Thank you so much!

00:24:06.689 --> 00:24:09.732
Thank you United and Miu for making something

00:24:09.712 --> 00:24:17.010
Ruffians are tiny.

00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:22.022
What are you talking about?

00:24:22.322 --> 00:24:25.510
We're not gonna step on you.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:43.380
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:25:01.096 --> 00:25:03.339
Please go and check it out there!

00:25:03.939 --> 00:25:07.223
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:25:07.243 --> 00:25:10.307
Thank you for 100,000 views!

00:25:10.327 --> 00:25:11.889
Over 100,000 views on Lifetime Showtime 2!

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:17.296
We hope that, you know, it can continue to be a song that we treasure for years and years to come from now on!

00:25:18.096 --> 00:25:22.582
You know, maybe even a lifetime!

00:25:23.883 --> 00:25:26.326
BAU BAU!

00:25:26.346 --> 00:25:26.867
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:27.387 --> 00:25:32.314
But that's not it for the anniversary celebration stuff, huh?

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:36.199
We still haven't quite celebrated in other ways, right?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:44.731
Yeah, we still have Advent 2nd Anniversary!

00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:52.121
Well, tonight at 6-7pm ET, Ruffians, we're gonna be having a very special off-collab together with all of us!

00:25:52.142 --> 00:25:55.386
We're gonna be doing some karaoke together!

00:25:55.366 --> 00:26:20.496
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:20.476 --> 00:26:31.245
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:26:31.732 --> 00:26:55.748
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:55.728 --> 00:26:57.851
Happy 2nd Anniversary!

00:26:58.893 --> 00:27:09.170
Speaking of you know our 2nd anniversary celebration.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.737
There was also a special episode released.

00:27:13.717 --> 00:27:21.448
3D animation series Holo no Graffiti over on the official hololive channel!

00:27:21.468 --> 00:27:22.349
Have you seen it?

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:23.451
Abyss!

00:27:23.511 --> 00:27:24.252
Did you see it?

00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:25.854
Check it out!

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:26.595
You saw it!

00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:30.440
I saw it yesterday!

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:30.620
BAU BAU!

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.064
It was cute!

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:34.005
BAU BAU!

00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:38.792
I liked it when you know she already used the bookmarks like kunai!

00:27:39.132 --> 00:27:39.673
Oh yeah!

00:27:39.653 --> 00:27:43.277
We get into all sorts of trouble and a lot of things happen.

00:27:43.918 --> 00:27:47.602
You know, I always say things like, can you stand up for me?

00:27:47.802 --> 00:27:47.982
Why?

00:27:48.322 --> 00:27:48.503
Why?

00:27:48.603 --> 00:27:49.263
And what was it?

00:27:49.764 --> 00:27:50.525
Don't sit down?

00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:53.288
Yeah.

00:27:53.308 --> 00:27:54.229
Girls don't sit down?

00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:55.831
Bad girls don't sit down?

00:27:56.151 --> 00:27:57.492
Bad girls don't sit down?

00:27:57.773 --> 00:27:57.873
Yeah.

00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:58.353
Was that it?

00:27:59.374 --> 00:28:02.638
You'll have to check it out and find the context on this, you know?

00:28:02.658 --> 00:28:05.181
What does that even mean?

00:28:06.182 --> 00:28:09.205

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:42.160
I'm not breaking, you know.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.461
Pokey's dead!

00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:44.542
Pokey's dead!

00:28:44.562 --> 00:28:44.642
Why?

00:28:45.003 --> 00:28:45.063
Ah!

00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:48.686
Different.

00:28:48.706 --> 00:28:48.866
Yeah.

00:28:48.886 --> 00:28:49.147
Pokiboo.

00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:51.048
No windows.

00:28:51.068 --> 00:28:51.249
Yeah.

00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:56.093
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:56.253 --> 00:28:56.714
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:56.894 --> 00:28:57.735

00:28:57.815 --> 00:28:58.135

00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:05.382
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:05.843 --> 00:29:06.023
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:07.444
ASMR.

00:29:07.464 --> 00:29:07.845
Yes!

00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:09.788
Our very first ASMR stream!

00:29:09.828 --> 00:29:10.590
What?

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.293
We did it together.

00:29:12.313 --> 00:29:12.614
ASMR!

00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:13.956
ASMR what did I say?

00:29:13.976 --> 00:29:14.457
ASMR.

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:16.822
Oh.

00:29:16.962 --> 00:29:22.172
ASMR stream we did it together with the Doggy Pack members!

00:29:22.726 --> 00:29:23.547
It was a test.

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:24.768
A test, you know.

00:29:24.788 --> 00:29:30.875
I feel like, judging from the Doggy Pack's reaction, it was a successful first test.

00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:36.441
But we were super duper nervous and, you know, we prepared a bunch.

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:40.266
A lot of testing, a lot of trial and error.

00:29:40.286 --> 00:29:47.974
Just to be able to kind of get it to the best sound it could be with our noobiness.

00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:48.615
Yeah.

00:29:48.595 --> 00:29:53.406
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:55.731
There are mistakes.

00:29:55.832 --> 00:29:56.633
Incidents.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.841
We'll continue to try our best.

00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:04.351
No incidents with the Ruffians is broke, I don't think.

00:30:04.371 --> 00:30:04.572
No!

00:30:05.454 --> 00:30:05.814
So vague.

00:30:05.995 --> 00:30:06.115
Right?

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:13.836
Yeah, but we'll ask our senpai for help too.

00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:17.441
Maybe get some lessons from them if we're so lucky.

00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:22.987
You know, maybe that way we can continue to try our best to help you relax.

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:32.338
I feel like, you know, relaxation is also a very important part of being able to protect the Ruffian smiles too.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:40.612
It's pretty rare for two twin demon guard dogs to do ASMR together, right?

00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:43.316
It'll be something nice that we can, you know, explore more.

00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:46.802
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:30:46.822 --> 00:30:50.007
Thank you for all your super sweet comments and encouragement, too!

00:30:50.027 --> 00:30:55.695
Yeah, we know we still have a long way to go, but we'll do our best, okay?

00:30:55.715 --> 00:30:56.016
BAU BAU!

00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:57.398
Please check it out!

00:30:57.378 --> 00:30:59.641
Support of the Doggy Pack are interesting!

00:31:00.302 --> 00:31:00.703
I know!

00:31:00.723 --> 00:31:04.729
I love to do lessons and all!

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.711
Senpai!

00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:10.558
Okayu Senpai!

00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:12.541
Katsurane-chan too!

00:31:13.102 --> 00:31:14.965
Thank you Abyss!

00:31:14.945 --> 00:31:20.033
Well, there is another very exciting thing that happened!

00:31:20.053 --> 00:31:21.635
You were there!

00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:21.976
You were there!

00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:24.680
Right, Ruffians?

00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:38.201
Hololive English -Justice-'s Elizabeth and Gigi both made their 3D debuts last weekend!

00:31:38.221 --> 00:31:38.661
Oh my congratulations!

00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:40.745
What did you think, Ruffians?

00:31:41.345 --> 00:31:43.028
Were you blown away?

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.242
Did you boink boink?

00:31:45.643 --> 00:31:51.051
I felt like Gigi's... Whoa.

00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:53.214
Wizard Ojii-chan!

00:31:53.635 --> 00:31:53.775
Yeah!

00:31:53.795 --> 00:31:55.057
That was so haza!

00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:58.423
It's a bit chaotic.

00:31:58.443 --> 00:31:59.524
You like Ojii-chan?

00:31:59.725 --> 00:32:00.746
Wizard Ojii-chan?

00:32:02.309 --> 00:32:06.595
I feel like, I don't know if everybody noticed, but that was Gigi's 3D debut.

00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:10.161
That was Wizard Ojii-chan, which could also be Gigi.

00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:10.762
Gigi.

00:32:11.002 --> 00:32:11.563
Yeah.

00:32:11.543 --> 00:32:17.509
You know... Did you realize it's Gigi and... There's two Gigi's.

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:19.410
And Gigi's 3D debut.

00:32:21.152 --> 00:32:22.774
Lots of debuts.

00:32:23.254 --> 00:32:24.555
Oh gosh, yeah.

00:32:26.137 --> 00:32:31.101
But at FUWAMOCO, actually, you know, we had something funny happen.

00:32:31.322 --> 00:32:38.108
We walked by the green room at the studio while Gigi was doing her high-souls for her 3D debut.

00:32:38.088 --> 00:32:41.433
We saw a green room for Furukawa-san.

00:32:41.453 --> 00:32:52.549
Yeah, and I was like, I'm seeing Furukawa-san, and we're like... We were really surprised when Gigi said, oh that's the wizard!

00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:53.791
The wizard here!

00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:53.911
Yeah!

00:32:55.072 --> 00:32:57.696
I have a wizard!

00:32:57.736 --> 00:32:59.739
Wizard Ojii-chan!

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:00.701
Now we understand.

00:33:01.742 --> 00:33:03.825
I don't understand the right words.

00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:07.430
But now, it's yes.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.036
Information is processed.

00:33:11.178 --> 00:33:14.024
And the kids quieted too!

00:33:14.044 --> 00:33:15.107
It was amazing!

00:33:15.247 --> 00:33:18.093
Gigi was singing the song for us, you know?

00:33:18.694 --> 00:33:19.316
Gigi's the best.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:21.460
Gigi is great.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.464
Gigi's the best.

00:33:24.484 --> 00:33:26.726
Yeah, we love it so hard.

00:33:27.648 --> 00:33:33.355
But we're really glad that they both got to do the 3D debut of their dreams.

00:33:33.375 --> 00:33:35.798
And you know, that's not it.

00:33:35.838 --> 00:33:41.445
There's still two members of Justice Riot.

00:33:41.525 --> 00:33:43.047
Cecilia and Raora.

00:33:43.067 --> 00:33:47.172
They're gonna be making their 3D debuts.

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:47.532
Cecilia and Raora.

00:33:47.512 --> 00:33:52.508
And she's going to be debuting on the 8th at 5pm.

00:33:52.729 --> 00:33:54.615
Don't laugh, Ruffians, okay?

00:33:54.635 --> 00:33:59.530
What did you say, Su-su-su?

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.614
Su-su-su, yes.

00:34:00.634 --> 00:34:00.694
No.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.963
No, no!

00:34:04.984 --> 00:34:09.450
She's going to begin her DD debut on the 9th at 5pm!

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.832
So please don't miss it!

00:34:10.852 --> 00:34:12.214
Put it into your calendars, okay?

00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:17.121
There is also the Justice 3D collab next weekend, okay?

00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:20.866
I feel like that is easy to maybe miss, so don't forget it.

00:34:21.006 --> 00:34:22.007
Don't miss it.

00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:25.312
You'll be crying if you miss it, okay?

00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:25.973
We don't want that.

00:34:25.953 --> 00:34:27.295
Yeah.

00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:32.883
Well, you know, especially after just how amazing Elizabeth and Gigi's were too.

00:34:34.786 --> 00:34:36.368
Please go and cheer them on!

00:34:36.388 --> 00:34:38.371
BAU BAU!

00:34:39.532 --> 00:34:39.733
Thank you!

00:34:39.753 --> 00:34:41.335
I'm so happy and all.

00:34:41.816 --> 00:34:44.940
I feel like I'm a big senpai or something.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.721
Thank you.

00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:49.847
I was like, oh, what if there's more kouhai that join us?

00:34:49.867 --> 00:34:54.694
Then we'll have kouhai and our kouhai will be senpai and then oh no!

00:34:54.674 --> 00:34:56.857
Then it's been a while, then, huh, Moco-chan?

00:35:00.042 --> 00:35:01.044
We can't howl that.

00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:02.646
That would be frightening.

00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:04.869
Maybe that's how Calli-senpai feels, huh?

00:35:06.612 --> 00:35:10.598
BAU BAU!

00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:12.701
It's dusty!

00:35:12.721 --> 00:35:14.203
Dusty like us!

00:35:14.223 --> 00:35:14.283
No!

00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:17.128
We'll be a fuzzy here.

00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:20.112
There's, you know, second anniversary things.

00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:22.015
Yeah.

00:35:23.294 --> 00:35:24.515
Ruffians!

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:26.878
Are you excited for August to start?

00:35:26.898 --> 00:35:30.742
Are you like, Moco-chan is like, August, August.

00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:30.983
Yeah.

00:35:32.044 --> 00:35:34.206
Are you looking forward to it?

00:35:34.226 --> 00:35:36.970
Do you need maybe a little bit of a push?

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.871
Really?

00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:38.371
Really?

00:35:38.391 --> 00:35:40.874
Moco-chan, what do you mean?

00:35:40.894 --> 00:35:42.296
Are you protesting this?

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:45.980
You really need it.

00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:49.724
It's a big month for you, Sima.

00:35:49.744 --> 00:35:49.944
Moco-chan!

00:35:51.045 --> 00:35:51.646
It's your birthday month!

00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:52.407
Why are you so excited?

00:35:53.787 --> 00:35:54.468
Hi.

00:35:55.428 --> 00:36:02.735
FUWAMOCO-chan, maybe you have something that you could say that would help her cry just a little bit.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.000
Okay.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.562
Oh boy!

00:36:10.982 --> 00:36:11.362
Ruffians!

00:36:12.463 --> 00:36:13.825
It's that time again!

00:36:15.046 --> 00:36:18.208
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:23.473
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.689
Ruffians!

00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:28.272
It's time to wake up!

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:30.515
And go out for the day!

00:36:33.118 --> 00:36:35.720
Are you ready to face it?

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:41.166
Huh?

00:36:41.186 --> 00:36:41.567
No.

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:44.290
You're still waking up.

00:36:46.853 --> 00:36:51.478
You don't want to.

00:36:51.498 --> 00:36:51.638
Really?

00:36:51.658 --> 00:36:52.819
Really really?

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:54.405
Are you sure?

00:36:54.525 --> 00:36:58.231
Well then.

00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:01.917
I guess it's okay just this once, okay?

00:37:02.858 --> 00:37:03.940
You can go back to sleep.

00:37:05.582 --> 00:37:05.903
Okay.

00:37:05.983 --> 00:37:09.368
Okay, I'll tuck you back into bed.

00:37:09.388 --> 00:37:12.293
But get a good pineapple, okay?

00:37:13.094 --> 00:37:14.737
I know you'll be able to take one the day after.

00:37:14.777 --> 00:37:16.880
We're always on your side!

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.581
Got it?

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:19.364
BAU BAU!

00:37:19.504 --> 00:37:21.287
Ganbatte desh!

00:37:21.925 --> 00:37:24.410
BAU BAU!

00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:30.704
Moco-chan, the Ruffians gonna be able to fall back just for 10 minutes after this.

00:37:31.526 --> 00:37:32.268
Just a little bit.

00:37:32.688 --> 00:37:34.332
I don't want to use the ASMR skill.

00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:46.330
Ruffians probably can't even hear the howl.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:46.631
BAU BAU!

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.254
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day.

00:37:50.014 --> 00:37:52.117
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:37:52.137 --> 00:38:00.286
Today we have... Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:38:00.306 --> 00:38:01.708
It's Max!

00:38:01.728 --> 00:38:01.888
BAU BAU!

00:38:01.868 --> 00:38:14.341
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:31.639
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:34.002
Mind you, Garibaldi, no, this is Max!

00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:34.863
This is Max!

00:38:35.224 --> 00:38:41.192
And he look, look at Max's little bowtie there!

00:38:41.212 --> 00:38:41.312
Yeah!

00:38:41.332 --> 00:38:42.313
Very, very cute!

00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:43.134
It's supposed to be cute!

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.256
But yeah, he looks very good in that.

00:38:44.276 --> 00:38:45.157
Very great.

00:38:45.177 --> 00:38:47.340
Very grandiose.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.364
But yeah, FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Max BAU BAU?

00:38:53.388 --> 00:38:58.835
Hmm... Huh?

00:38:58.855 --> 00:38:58.935
Huh?

00:38:58.955 --> 00:38:59.035
Huh?

00:38:59.055 --> 00:38:59.736
BAU BAU.

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:06.157
FUWAMOCO.

00:39:08.161 --> 00:39:16.358
FUWAMOCO.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.608
Other than that, I guess, Max has some really great hobbies.

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:30.599
You know, things like sleeping, and eating, and asking for food.

00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:32.402
Very refined hobbies.

00:39:32.643 --> 00:39:35.528
It sounds like a good schedule, right?

00:39:35.508 --> 00:39:37.151
Yeah, how do you help me?

00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:43.463
I think, you know, Max, sometimes it might be hard, a little bit hard for him to see clearly sometimes.

00:39:43.483 --> 00:39:44.986
Oh, maybe because there's a window in front?

00:39:45.366 --> 00:39:51.498
Ah, well, you know, but we hope that Max finds his way into some excellent cuddles!

00:39:53.602 --> 00:39:54.363
Yaaay!

00:39:54.964 --> 00:39:58.090
BAU BAU!

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.240
And next we have our next playmate.

00:40:02.581 --> 00:40:05.027
Today I went on a walk!

00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:06.170
De-den!

00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:11.001
What a beautiful beach!

00:40:11.061 --> 00:40:11.763
So picturesque!

00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:12.405
A beach?

00:40:12.445 --> 00:40:13.166
Seaside?

00:40:13.287 --> 00:40:15.893
What's the difference between a beach and a seaside?

00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:19.360
I don't know, is this a place to ask?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.145
It's a beautiful place!

00:40:23.165 --> 00:40:26.710
It looks like, you know, when somebody tells you to draw a picture of a beach.

00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:28.833
Or like a sea.

00:40:28.853 --> 00:40:31.858
I don't know.

00:40:31.878 --> 00:40:36.504
You draw like the water, and then like a bench maybe, and a tree?

00:40:36.945 --> 00:40:39.248
I don't know, this looks like a photograph.

00:40:39.953 --> 00:40:43.157
Ruffians is FUWAMOCO.

00:40:43.177 --> 00:40:44.979
This is a picture of a beach.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.064
Beaches have sand or rocks.

00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:52.206
They have benches and trees, okay?

00:40:53.628 --> 00:40:56.311
It's very nice and relaxing.

00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:58.874
And it's a good way to get a refresher.

00:40:58.974 --> 00:40:59.815
Beautiful beach.

00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:05.421
Yeah, so I'm really really glad that you got a bit of a change of pace here.

00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:19.967
Spend some time outside.

00:41:20.386 --> 00:41:21.288
It's a lake!

00:41:22.671 --> 00:41:23.893
It's a beach!

00:41:23.913 --> 00:41:25.937
Apparently it's a lake, okay.

00:41:25.957 --> 00:41:27.119
This is a beach!

00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:32.831
Ruffians, whenever you're having a rough time, we hope that you'll go on walks like this too.

00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:33.893
Think of this beach here.

00:41:34.835 --> 00:41:35.275
Okay.

00:41:35.336 --> 00:41:36.157
Dry, okay?

00:41:36.197 --> 00:41:41.267
Think of the sound of the leaves and the dolphins.

00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:41.668
Okay?

00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:44.245
BAU BAU!

00:41:45.047 --> 00:41:47.211
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:41:47.611 --> 00:41:51.438
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:52.680
BAU BAU!

00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:02.577
We know FUWAMOCO likes picking up cicada shells, and has even eaten inago, which is their food.

00:42:02.557 --> 00:42:04.999
Are there any insects you're afraid of?

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.142
Like spiders or gokiburi?

00:42:08.663 --> 00:42:12.687
Yeah, we even got to pick up a bunch of cicada shells!

00:42:14.288 --> 00:42:14.788
I'm super happy!

00:42:14.808 --> 00:42:17.611
We got five for Advent!

00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:20.654
We were going on a walk so then we were looking around for them.

00:42:20.674 --> 00:42:22.936
We were looking for anything shiny around our feet.

00:42:26.019 --> 00:42:29.222
And then we found like a...

00:42:29.202 --> 00:42:38.756
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:47.008
Have a howl of a day!

00:42:47.663 --> 00:42:49.548
That was beautiful!

00:42:49.568 --> 00:42:56.767
A whole cicada, yes!

00:42:56.787 --> 00:42:58.852
Yeah, we kicked them out!

00:42:58.872 --> 00:43:00.677
I don't know if it's helping.

00:43:02.024 --> 00:43:06.550
And you know... It was so beautiful, it was our perfect specimen!

00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:08.713
And then you know, we saw it.

00:43:09.634 --> 00:43:13.880
Actually... We ran into Nene-senpai!

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.841
At the studio!

00:43:15.362 --> 00:43:17.665
And then you know, we go, Nene-senpai, look!

00:43:18.446 --> 00:43:23.332
Look, a present for you!

00:43:23.353 --> 00:43:25.095
And she's like, kawaii!

00:43:25.656 --> 00:43:25.756
Cute!

00:43:25.776 --> 00:43:26.697
She was so happy!

00:43:27.138 --> 00:43:28.960
I've never seen this!

00:43:30.593 --> 00:43:48.535
Nerissa always runs away when I let Nerissa look at them.

00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:53.904
Really, Nerissa, guess what I have in my bag right now.

00:43:54.686 --> 00:43:54.906
Huh?

00:43:54.926 --> 00:44:01.338
Yeah, but, uh... Once we're free, though... When does the kira flies at us?

00:44:01.358 --> 00:44:03.722
It's mainly flying bugs, you know.

00:44:04.242 --> 00:44:04.743
Yeah.

00:44:05.463 --> 00:44:06.084
Cicadas.

00:44:06.565 --> 00:44:09.668
We were looking for cicadas, but then we saw gokiburi instead.

00:44:09.688 --> 00:44:10.108
Yeah.

00:44:10.529 --> 00:44:14.033
That wasn't really... It's only scary when you're not expecting it.

00:44:14.053 --> 00:44:17.136
It's in places like, you know, your home.

00:44:17.156 --> 00:44:17.677
Yeah, home.

00:44:18.217 --> 00:44:20.520
That doesn't happen for FUWAMOCO, though.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.462
But spiders are also unsettling.

00:44:22.482 --> 00:44:23.363
I don't really like them.

00:44:23.403 --> 00:44:27.608
I know they're friends, but they're kind of... Mama Puppy deals with the spiders.

00:44:27.628 --> 00:44:27.908
Yeah.

00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:29.710
Yeah.
