Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:07.933 --> 05:08.253
Moco-chan!

05:08.273 --> 05:08.994
We forgot to hide.

05:09.294 --> 05:10.034
How about the trampoline?

05:10.054 --> 05:11.836
Moco-chan, can you pull the trampoline?

05:11.856 --> 05:32.451

It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.260 --> 05:41.964
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:42.024 --> 05:44.146
BAU BAU!

05:44.786 --> 05:47.950
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:48.470 --> 05:49.191
I'm not Fuwawa!

05:49.691 --> 05:51.153
I'm Mococo!

05:51.253 --> 05:57.298
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:57.318 --> 05:57.818
BAU BAU!

05:58.539 --> 06:03.283
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:03.363 --> 06:04.364
BAU BAU!

06:04.604 --> 06:05.265
Ruffians.

06:05.625 --> 06:06.306
Today!

06:07.186 --> 06:08.327
Today is the day.

06:08.348 --> 06:08.948
Today is the 101st.

06:16.824 --> 06:19.826
FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:20.166 --> 06:24.109
Thank you for joining us today for our 101st episode!

06:24.149 --> 06:24.530
BAU BAU!

06:24.550 --> 06:27.532
Is that how you say it?

06:27.632 --> 06:30.134
I'm gonna have a hard time saying it now.

06:30.154 --> 06:30.194
101st.

06:30.314 --> 06:34.857
Yeah, I'm not good at saying the bigger numbers.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.078
102nd, I feel like it's easier.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.279
101st sounds weird, right?

06:37.339 --> 06:37.879
How are the 200?

06:43.050 --> 06:43.290
That's two.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.471
That's a lot of numbers.

06:44.531 --> 06:45.952
That's two.

06:45.992 --> 06:47.593
BAU BAU!

06:47.613 --> 06:49.094
BAU BAU!

06:49.455 --> 06:54.038
Well, first off, Ruffians are maybe joining us today for the very first time!

06:54.058 --> 07:01.664
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday!

07:01.924 --> 07:02.504
A.K.A.

07:02.564 --> 07:03.405
FUWAMOCO!

07:03.645 --> 07:04.686
Hosted by us!

07:05.266 --> 07:06.767
FUWAMOCO!

07:06.787 --> 07:12.872
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:13.193 --> 07:18.056
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:18.397 --> 07:21.619
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:21.659 --> 07:22.040
BAU BAU!

07:27.725 --> 07:31.807
It's because we didn't bounce on the trampoline right away, Moco-chan.

07:32.167 --> 07:33.728
Did you miss the trampoline that much?

07:33.828 --> 07:37.270
Yeah, the trampoline is a very important part of our morning.

07:37.910 --> 07:38.670
BAU BAU!

07:38.730 --> 07:44.673
Ruffians, did you hear that?

07:44.713 --> 07:50.396
You have to start out your morning not just with FUWAMOCO Morning, but also the trampoline.

07:52.737 --> 07:54.458
We're not worried about anything yet.

07:55.178 --> 07:58.359
I'm worried about if there's gonna be a trampoline next time though.

07:58.419 --> 07:58.700
BAU BAU!

07:58.740 --> 08:00.740
BAU BAU!

08:02.141 --> 08:04.782
Well, I have something for you to worry about, Ruffians.

08:04.862 --> 08:06.023
A new morning!

08:06.083 --> 08:06.883
Not a new morning.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.564
It is a new morning, but that's not what they should worry about!

08:10.584 --> 08:10.624
No.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.305
I... Moco-chan.

08:14.186 --> 08:14.486
Justice.

08:15.506 --> 08:15.767
No!

08:16.327 --> 08:19.088
They're coming... They're not going after the Ruffians.

08:19.188 --> 08:21.649
Nobody needs to worry about them!

08:22.957 --> 08:30.081
If you say it like that, then I'm convinced, Moco-chan.

08:30.161 --> 08:30.821
Just like that.

08:31.101 --> 08:33.542
Confidence!

08:33.602 --> 08:35.343
But yes, Ruffians, you have to worry.

08:35.363 --> 08:35.423
Why?

08:36.044 --> 08:36.644
Why?

08:37.024 --> 08:40.126
Because there's been bad news.

08:40.546 --> 08:41.986
Bad news?

08:42.026 --> 08:44.067
Like Shiori left all her snacks bad news?

08:44.148 --> 08:44.748
No, not like that!

08:44.768 --> 08:48.450
Biboo didn't get ice cream bad news.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.991
There's been another peril sighting.

08:52.142 --> 08:52.262
De-den!

08:52.282 --> 08:52.582
Ruffians!

09:12.358 --> 09:13.779
Your beloved as in- Wait!

09:13.859 --> 09:14.979
Your beloved Nendoroids!

09:15.039 --> 09:15.459
Wait!

09:15.599 --> 09:16.699
What's going on?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.601
Is- Is Pero splitting off into multiple different Pero's?

09:21.081 --> 09:29.104
Or, uh, did- did Good Smile decide to bring out some really silly Pero face parts for some Nendoroids, or?

09:29.164 --> 09:29.484
No.

09:30.844 --> 09:32.765
I- I don't think they can do that, you know?

09:32.785 --> 09:35.526
Um, I guess that makes sense.

09:36.086 --> 09:37.426
But, why would they do that?

09:37.446 --> 09:39.147
Why would they ever want to do that, huh?

09:39.167 --> 09:40.087
So, then- Huh?

09:40.668 --> 09:41.088
Huh?

09:41.168 --> 09:41.688
Wait, so-

09:43.288 --> 09:46.569
But this then, is Pero taking over our senpai's pets too?

09:46.889 --> 09:47.889
You know, right?

09:48.289 --> 09:51.991
Bubba is now... Plubba!

09:52.091 --> 09:55.111
Boop is... Blero.

09:55.131 --> 09:58.532
Can you see, Ruffian?

09:58.552 --> 10:01.313
Right there, so tiny.

10:02.454 --> 10:03.034
Wow.

10:04.874 --> 10:06.115
I kinda like them.

10:06.495 --> 10:09.536
Look at Korone-senpai, Okayu-senpai.

10:09.556 --> 10:10.596
Kinda...

10:11.383 --> 10:12.464
Kinda works, you know.

10:12.484 --> 10:16.486
Pero's face strangely... It fits well, right?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.367
Right?

10:20.368 --> 10:21.188
But why though?

10:21.689 --> 10:22.689
Pero-gami korone.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.269
Pero-gami.

10:25.451 --> 10:26.291
I don't like that.

10:26.651 --> 10:27.472
I don't like that.

10:27.572 --> 10:28.532
Not at all.

10:28.612 --> 10:28.972
No.

10:31.474 --> 10:31.814
Yeah.

10:32.354 --> 10:32.754
I don't know.

10:32.814 --> 10:37.417
I don't think we need to think that deeply about it, Ruffians, but... Yeah.

10:39.246 --> 10:46.008
We hope that your figures, maybe they return to their normal, cute, not nasty selves.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.229
Nasty selves, no.

10:47.289 --> 10:49.709
Just cute.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.290
It's a very nice collection.

10:52.350 --> 10:52.610
I know.

10:52.670 --> 10:59.072
I can only dream of FUWAMOCO Nendoroids and figures one day.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.933
She'll be excited, Ruffians.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.254
Not as excited as us, Moco-chan.

11:04.854 --> 11:05.654
That's always it.

11:06.441 --> 11:13.251
BAU BAU!

11:13.471 --> 11:21.261
Pero Sighting can be disappointing, but the next is not disappointing.

11:24.545 --> 11:29.489
Ruffians, you might have noticed this, but maybe you didn't yet.

11:29.849 --> 11:32.711
I don't know, has there been much information in English about it yet?

11:32.891 --> 11:33.571
Maybe not.

11:34.912 --> 11:43.417
But there's something called hololive City, and it was recently announced to be happening again this summer!

11:45.358 --> 11:49.019
hololive City is back this year, 2024.

11:49.199 --> 11:53.501
It happened last year with Tokyo Dome City, but this year it's expanded.

11:53.521 --> 12:00.463
hololive City is now teaming up with multiple theme parks around Japan for an amazing club!

12:00.903 --> 12:01.543
And you know what?

12:02.526 --> 12:13.888
This time, us, us, FUWAMOCO, we're a part of it and we're representing hololive at Tokyo Dome City Attractions!

12:14.068 --> 12:16.089
BAU BAU!

12:17.409 --> 12:23.050
Aki-senpai, Torae-senpai, Aki-senpai, Suisei-senpai, Korone-senpai!

12:26.511 --> 12:28.032
BAU BAU!

12:28.332 --> 12:31.434
We're so excited!

12:31.875 --> 12:39.920
Ruffians, this event is gonna be going on from August 1st to September 2nd!

12:39.960 --> 12:41.581
That's a month.

12:42.541 --> 12:45.283
But there'll be a bunch of special things going on.

12:45.303 --> 12:54.309
There'll be collab goods, as well as collab attractions and rides, foods and drinks, stamp rally, minigames,

12:55.453 --> 12:57.595
Even an escape game.

12:57.615 --> 12:59.696
Escape game, huh?

13:00.337 --> 13:03.439
Who knows what could be announced, huh?

13:03.479 --> 13:04.399
Just lots of fun.

13:04.579 --> 13:04.940
Yeah.

13:05.140 --> 13:18.910
And while FUWAMOCO will be a part of the Tokyo Amusement Park, the Tokyo Dome City Attractions, there are also other parks all across Japan collabing with multiple senpais, so please check it out too!

13:19.010 --> 13:22.132
No, especially if you're planning a trip to Japan any time this year.

13:22.612 --> 13:23.012
Right?

13:23.113 --> 13:25.855
Make sure to keep hololive CD in mind, okay?

13:26.235 --> 13:29.458
It's the perfect time to check out Japan's best fun parks!

13:29.578 --> 13:30.158
Right?

13:30.278 --> 13:34.282
Yeah, not just, you know, the land with the mouse.

13:34.782 --> 13:38.005
There's a lot of different fun parks, you know.

13:38.045 --> 13:47.432
And actually, FUWAMOCO, when it comes to theme parks, like in Japan, we've only ever been to one called Space World!

13:47.452 --> 13:48.333
Space World!

13:48.533 --> 13:49.434
In Fukuoka.

13:49.934 --> 13:50.355
Yeah.

13:50.982 --> 13:56.495
It was a really fun time, but actually now it's closed.

13:58.351 --> 14:03.334
So, you know, that means we have to go have fun at the fun parks while we can still have fun.

14:03.475 --> 14:07.217
You know, be there for your oshi while you can.

14:07.858 --> 14:10.279
You know, go have fun at the fun parks while you can have fun.

14:10.299 --> 14:14.102
Yeah, we have to go explore lots of them, huh?

14:14.162 --> 14:15.523
Especially Tokyo Dome City.

14:15.583 --> 14:18.625
Yeah, we're looking forward to it!

14:18.705 --> 14:21.367
BAU BAU!

14:21.607 --> 14:25.249
And that's all we have for FUWAMOCO Morning, huh?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
Ruffians.

14:30.021 --> 14:32.481
Yeah, that's how we're gonna do things from now on.

14:32.982 --> 14:34.482
Episode 101.

14:35.102 --> 14:38.083
FUWAMOCO Morning ends by 810 AM.

14:38.103 --> 14:41.625
Way more on time than we've ever been, huh?

14:41.685 --> 14:42.085
Right?

14:42.845 --> 14:43.345
Yeah.

14:44.346 --> 14:45.006
Right?

14:45.166 --> 14:47.507
Nothing more to mention.

14:47.707 --> 14:48.247
That's it.

14:48.847 --> 14:49.527
Out of news.

14:49.647 --> 14:50.808
Right, Moco-chan?

14:50.868 --> 14:52.028
Nothing mentionable.

14:52.468 --> 14:52.809
Yeah.

14:53.369 --> 14:53.529
No.

14:55.470 --> 14:56.471
Nah!

14:56.911 --> 15:00.454
That's not the case at all, right, Ruffians?

15:00.914 --> 15:01.595
Yeah!

15:01.655 --> 15:06.199
Yeah, because there's been some amazing news, big updates.

15:06.759 --> 15:10.662
And, well, we talk a lot about BAU time and how time kind of passes funnily.

15:11.223 --> 15:11.663
Funnily?

15:11.963 --> 15:12.744
Funnily.

15:13.104 --> 15:17.488
You know, because I see it really just feels just like yesterday.

15:17.508 --> 15:21.351
That us and all of Advent, we just debuted, right?

15:21.411 --> 15:21.911
Right!

15:22.212 --> 15:23.092
But it's not!

15:23.192 --> 15:24.554
We did not debut yesterday!

15:25.295 --> 15:31.192
Yeah, you know, actually, we didn't debut yesterday, but it was announced!

15:32.540 --> 15:41.364
hololive Justice, a brand new hololive EN generation, will be making their debut!

15:41.464 --> 15:43.985
BAU BAU BAU!

15:44.066 --> 15:45.206
It's not my debut.

15:45.306 --> 15:46.447
No, no, no.

15:46.747 --> 15:48.948
My debut happened 11 months ago.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.188
Somehow, yeah.

15:50.509 --> 15:52.670
But I'm so excited!

15:53.850 --> 15:57.872
You know, we'll have four lovely hololive EN kohai.

15:59.913 --> 16:06.118
Well, even though, you know, they're lovely and I'm sure that they will respect us lots as their senpai.

16:06.558 --> 16:07.038
Right.

16:07.058 --> 16:16.586
To be truthful, I haven't seen anything like that from them yet.

16:17.847 --> 16:18.867
Yeah, you don't.

16:18.887 --> 16:23.331
They're trying to catch us and put us back in the cell.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.033
Huh?

16:25.654 --> 16:25.874
No.

16:26.494 --> 16:27.235
Ruffians!

16:27.836 --> 16:30.318
We told you we're innocent puppies, right?

16:30.478 --> 16:30.658
Innocent!

16:30.818 --> 16:31.799
You know it, right?

16:32.279 --> 16:34.902
We just got carried away.

16:34.942 --> 16:36.923
We're having fun!

16:37.384 --> 16:40.727
You know how it can be seriously silly sometimes, right?

16:40.767 --> 16:41.808
Yeah.

16:41.908 --> 16:42.568
It's just that.

16:43.389 --> 16:43.729
Yeah.

16:43.749 --> 16:44.190
Sure!

16:46.504 --> 16:47.884
It's been 11 months, Ruffians!

16:47.924 --> 16:50.545
We're innocent puppies!

16:50.845 --> 16:51.605
Yeah.

16:52.085 --> 16:52.545
We know that.

16:52.585 --> 16:56.026
Puppies who are also demon-clad dogs take care of your spine.

16:56.046 --> 16:58.287
Yeah, yeah!

16:58.607 --> 16:59.307
First!

16:59.767 --> 17:07.989
Well, we have... Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.

17:09.109 --> 17:10.989
BAU BAU.

17:12.070 --> 17:13.050
She's their leader.

17:15.503 --> 17:16.483
FUWAMOCO.

17:18.384 --> 17:21.326
Actually, I'm more scared of her.

17:23.947 --> 17:24.287
Yeah.

17:25.968 --> 17:26.848
I don't like blood.

17:27.329 --> 17:28.249
I don't like flames.

17:29.029 --> 17:30.010
I don't like roses.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.150
I do like roses.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.491
That's okay.

17:33.571 --> 17:36.193
But you know, she just has this aura when she speaks.

17:36.793 --> 17:38.974
So commanding and... I don't know.

17:42.318 --> 17:43.139
Melodic!

17:43.159 --> 17:46.681
You know, we just become good puppies.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.663
I mean, baby puppies.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.005
I mean, good puppies.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.626
We're always good puppies, right, Moco-chan?

17:53.646 --> 17:54.906
I'm never a baby puppy.

17:56.267 --> 18:01.311
But, you know, there was a good mention of some good manners.

18:02.111 --> 18:04.073
And you know, FUWAMOCO, we like manners.

18:04.133 --> 18:04.853
Good manners.

18:05.253 --> 18:09.276
But, she's a bit proper.

18:09.896 --> 18:10.237
Right?

18:12.677 --> 18:14.339
Really don't want to get caught by her.

18:14.399 --> 18:14.599
No.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.220
No.

18:15.881 --> 18:16.561
No.

18:17.002 --> 18:17.523
Yeah.

18:18.484 --> 18:20.406
We have to find a way to put her out.

18:21.006 --> 18:22.088
Put out the flame.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.090
No more fire fire.

18:24.150 --> 18:25.692
No more lighting the fire for her.

18:25.752 --> 18:27.253
Yeah.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.295
But next!

18:28.735 --> 18:31.378
We have Gigi Murin.

18:36.098 --> 18:36.939
Oh my gosh.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.201
She's such a grumbler.

18:39.241 --> 18:41.122
She needs to calm down a bit, you know?

18:41.523 --> 18:43.244
Not chase us around so much.

18:43.344 --> 18:43.604
No!

18:43.824 --> 18:43.965
No!

18:44.645 --> 18:45.005
Yeah.

18:45.746 --> 18:51.771
Realize that no matter how hard she tries, we can smell a bad person's smell on her.

18:51.811 --> 18:53.252
Can you smell it, Ruffians?

18:54.013 --> 18:55.754
Yeah, she's not a dog.

18:56.175 --> 18:58.857
No dog smells grumbly.

18:59.257 --> 18:59.938
Yeah.

19:00.198 --> 19:02.720
I wonder why she wears such a silly hoodie though.

19:03.621 --> 19:03.881
Huh?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.682
Maybe it's just a fashion statement, huh?

19:08.603 --> 19:10.544
You can smell it too!

19:10.564 --> 19:10.644
Yeah.

19:11.906 --> 19:12.506
Okay.

19:13.667 --> 19:13.927
What?

19:14.107 --> 19:14.888
No.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.970
No.

19:17.631 --> 19:21.234
BAU BAU.

19:21.814 --> 19:26.879
And next, there's Cecilia Immergreen!

19:29.000 --> 19:29.421
No.

19:29.541 --> 19:29.901
She's a...

19:31.363 --> 19:32.264
An automaton.

19:32.685 --> 19:33.706
An automaton.

19:33.726 --> 19:34.687
Follow me then.

19:34.707 --> 19:34.767
A.K.A.

19:35.828 --> 19:37.831
A robot doll or something.

19:38.572 --> 19:39.413
Something else.

19:39.893 --> 19:41.095
Yeah!

19:41.235 --> 19:44.519
I really like sweet and cute me robots!

19:44.759 --> 19:51.107
But I... Then she decided to hunt us down so I... I'm sort of past that now.

19:51.187 --> 19:51.347
Hi.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.631
Yeah.

19:53.951 --> 19:58.853
But, you know, it looks like she does a lot more than just, like, bee-boops and those kind of things.

19:59.293 --> 19:59.893
Bee-boops!

19:59.933 --> 20:00.714
Bee-boops, not bee-boo.

20:00.734 --> 20:01.014
Bee-boops.

20:01.454 --> 20:01.934
Yeah.

20:02.515 --> 20:04.756
She can also play the violin, maybe.

20:06.196 --> 20:07.257
I guess that's pretty cool.

20:07.777 --> 20:08.897
Right?

20:09.218 --> 20:13.480
Yeah, but she won't get to us with that, though, right?

20:13.740 --> 20:14.080
Right.

20:14.300 --> 20:14.760
Right?

20:14.840 --> 20:18.002
We won't be like, ooh, what's that beautiful music, right?

20:18.082 --> 20:20.583
We would never be interested in music, right?

20:20.983 --> 20:21.043
No.

20:21.795 --> 20:23.376
It's not at all appealing to us.

20:25.478 --> 20:25.658
No.

20:26.939 --> 20:30.561
And... Finally!

20:30.581 --> 20:34.384
We have Raora Pantera!

20:35.825 --> 20:38.947
She's really scary when she has her eyes on us.

20:39.748 --> 20:41.349
But otherwise!

20:42.880 --> 20:43.901
That tail!

20:44.622 --> 20:46.923
I can't speak here, but that tail!

20:46.943 --> 20:51.226
I wanna eat my mouth!

20:51.246 --> 20:51.947
Thighs?

20:52.327 --> 20:52.507
No.

20:52.748 --> 20:53.028
No!

20:53.348 --> 20:54.249
Tail!

20:54.689 --> 20:56.831
Do you agree, Ruffians?

20:56.891 --> 20:57.631
Ruffians!

20:57.711 --> 20:58.212
Tail!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.834
Yeah, it's the perfect snack!

21:01.734 --> 21:02.315
Right?

21:02.715 --> 21:04.256
Do you see how thick it is?

21:05.117 --> 21:05.557
Juicy!

21:05.857 --> 21:06.097
Tail!

21:06.178 --> 21:06.458
Yeah!

21:11.621 --> 21:12.061
Yeah!

21:15.822 --> 21:18.743
Not if you're gonna look at her tails like they're a snack one.

21:18.983 --> 21:21.343
We've been looking at hers.

21:22.084 --> 21:24.284
Ruffians.

21:25.085 --> 21:28.586
Her composites that she makes, they're really amazing.

21:30.643 --> 21:33.445
A little bit too amazing though, no?

21:33.585 --> 21:37.048
They could be a little bit more rough, you know?

21:37.228 --> 21:43.073
That way, we're still cute, but maybe if it's rougher, we're not so identifiable.

21:43.113 --> 21:45.215
Yeah, and nobody could tell who we are.

21:45.335 --> 21:45.856
Right.

21:46.416 --> 21:46.856
Yeah.

21:48.298 --> 21:52.942
But, well, you know, Gigi smelt like a grumlin.

21:53.202 --> 21:53.542
Yeah.

21:54.783 --> 21:56.985
Raora, she has a very strong

21:58.160 --> 21:58.881
Feline.

22:02.144 --> 22:04.986
It's a good one.

22:05.307 --> 22:08.149
A good one that we can tolerate.

22:08.549 --> 22:09.450
Who knows?

22:16.610 --> 22:23.533
But all I know is that all cats smell good no matter how much everyone might complain.

22:23.773 --> 22:29.696
So, you know, I think that FUWAMOCO, we're probably gonna try and get a bite.

22:30.056 --> 22:33.217
If we happen to cross paths again with her soon.

22:33.277 --> 22:33.557
Maybe!

22:33.577 --> 22:36.939
We could just use the pizza as a distraction, right?

22:37.839 --> 22:38.520
That's our plan.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.361
So I'll put it with the pizza.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.602
Then the tail is ours.

22:45.120 --> 22:45.500
Yeah!

22:46.041 --> 22:47.762
Oh, it's like the circle of life!

22:48.542 --> 22:48.923
Is it?

22:49.023 --> 22:52.185
Cat eats pizza, dog eats cattail.

22:52.205 --> 22:52.265
Huh.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.267
Yeah, just like that.

22:55.327 --> 22:56.448
Dog is happy.

22:56.568 --> 22:57.529
Beautiful world.

22:57.949 --> 22:59.490
BAU BAU!

22:59.630 --> 23:00.791
BAU BAU!

23:01.231 --> 23:02.232
Yeah!

23:02.412 --> 23:04.373
And, well, you know, huh.

23:05.854 --> 23:08.136
They're gonna be making a debut soon, right?

23:08.556 --> 23:08.957
But!

23:08.977 --> 23:09.117
Huh?

23:09.177 --> 23:10.398
There's times!

23:12.108 --> 23:13.109
It's a little surprising.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.270
It's this weekend!

23:14.310 --> 23:18.753
Their debut is coming up this big weekend!

23:18.793 --> 23:22.556
They start at 8pm PT on Friday and Saturday.

23:22.576 --> 23:28.641
And then there will be a big collab with all of them on Saturday at 9.30pm PT.

23:29.402 --> 23:33.826
So you can see at the bottom of the graphic here.

23:33.866 --> 23:36.127
But you absolutely won't want to miss it!

23:36.228 --> 23:36.408
And...

23:39.005 --> 23:42.009
Also right now, if you head over to Twitter, you can actually even get

23:56.309 --> 23:56.649
BAU BAU!

24:27.410 --> 24:29.291
BAU BAU!

24:29.351 --> 24:32.773
Well, we hope that maybe you feel a little bit more energized

24:49.722 --> 24:50.203
Moco-chan!

24:50.283 --> 24:50.443
Wow.

25:13.993 --> 25:15.173
Ruffians!

25:16.094 --> 25:18.014
It's that time of the week again!

25:18.715 --> 25:19.795
You know what time it is.

25:20.795 --> 25:23.316
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

25:24.057 --> 25:27.658
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

25:27.678 --> 25:35.441
Actually, this year, it's a bit of a different Pup Talk.

25:36.223 --> 25:42.006
You know, this one is for our new holo and kohai that are debuting very soon.

25:42.026 --> 25:42.806
You might have heard of them.

25:43.346 --> 25:44.427
Justice!

25:45.667 --> 25:49.329
Of course, if it applies to you two Ruffians, it's even better.

25:50.609 --> 25:52.810
But anyways, Justice!

25:55.051 --> 26:01.554
You may be bad guys still trying to catch us, but I know that won't ever happen.

26:02.234 --> 26:05.496
So, instead, I'll have pity on you.

26:08.086 --> 26:11.730
Is it still a pup talk or is it a pity party?

26:11.750 --> 26:14.232
Anyways!

26:14.532 --> 26:15.854
Doesn't matter!

26:16.294 --> 26:17.155
Justice!

26:17.956 --> 26:20.778
It's your big debut day this weekend!

26:21.819 --> 26:23.681
It must still not feel real right.

26:24.622 --> 26:25.083
It must be...

26:26.102 --> 26:31.884
All sorts of emotions, you know, excited, happy, scared, nervous.

26:32.644 --> 26:34.144
But don't worry!

26:35.105 --> 26:36.845
Your debut will go perfectly.

26:37.485 --> 26:42.507
Because ultimately, all you have to do is just be you.

26:43.247 --> 26:45.287
Not anybody else, just you!

26:46.148 --> 26:48.588
You're here with us now for a reason.

26:49.588 --> 26:52.789
Believe in yourself and all the skills you've built up all this time.

26:52.809 --> 26:54.810
You know,

26:55.905 --> 27:00.756
It's sort of funny when you look back on all your experiences to see how many things have led up to now.

27:00.776 --> 27:04.385
It's sort of silly how things work like that, huh?

27:06.383 --> 27:11.765
And you know, if the debuts are too scary for you, just forget.

27:12.145 --> 27:12.845
Forget about it.

27:13.405 --> 27:22.869
Because after the debuts, what comes is lots of wonderful times with your newfound friends and audience on the debut.

27:23.389 --> 27:25.109
It'll just be over before you know it.

27:25.630 --> 27:27.490
So, enjoy it, okay?

27:28.111 --> 27:34.813
Just have fun, and let's both work hard to make Holo-EN an even more wonderful and special place, okay?

27:36.291 --> 27:38.033
You'll do amazing during your debut.

27:38.733 --> 27:39.914
I know it for sure!

27:41.316 --> 27:43.077
Let's all work hard together, okay?

27:43.097 --> 27:45.420
BAU BAU!

27:45.460 --> 27:47.121
Ganbatte ne!

27:47.181 --> 27:48.242
BAU BAU!

27:48.322 --> 27:49.904
BAU BAU!

27:49.924 --> 27:50.484
I'm full.

27:55.305 --> 27:58.067
Let's cheer for the MOTSUL KING!

27:58.187 --> 28:01.048
BAU BAU!

28:01.108 --> 28:02.029
Ruffians!

28:02.809 --> 28:06.691
I think we have another Doggie of the Day today, right Moco-chan?

28:07.111 --> 28:11.754
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

28:11.814 --> 28:14.255
It's Clyde!

28:14.335 --> 28:21.239
I guess he does look a bit tiny, but he's super powerful in his way.

28:21.279 --> 28:22.460
I like that one.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.081
Maybe he could outrun Gigi no problem.

28:26.101 --> 28:31.242
Yeah, I'd like to be able to do that too.

28:32.022 --> 28:33.922
We do our best, right?

28:34.162 --> 28:35.503
He looks like a doll.

28:36.143 --> 28:38.303
He's not a doll, he's a dog.

28:38.963 --> 28:41.064
Doggie of the Day, not dolly of the day.

28:41.324 --> 28:46.505
Yeah, well, apparently Cloud isn't the fluffiest one of us.

28:46.865 --> 28:48.605
But he loves fashion!

28:48.665 --> 28:49.285
Yeah!

28:49.345 --> 28:51.606
Yeah, he's also a lazy fashionista.

28:53.229 --> 28:53.749
Lazy one.

28:54.870 --> 28:58.071
But that's because he likes to cuddle.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.471
You can't fault him for that.

28:59.531 --> 29:00.391
Yeah.

29:00.451 --> 29:00.912
Hi.

29:01.592 --> 29:03.172
Wow, Moco-chan!

29:03.192 --> 29:03.633
Hi!

29:03.713 --> 29:06.794
How does Cloud BAU BAU?

29:08.074 --> 29:10.255
I think it's like... BAU BAU.

29:10.855 --> 29:11.515
BAU BAU.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.976
I can barely hear Cloud.

29:14.156 --> 29:14.756
BAU BAU.

29:15.256 --> 29:15.857
BAU BAU.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.197
BAU BAU.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.218
Very stylish, huh?

29:20.558 --> 29:21.539
Dignified BAU.

29:23.115 --> 29:23.355
Meow.

29:24.396 --> 29:24.596
Meow.

29:25.476 --> 29:25.676
Meow.

29:26.137 --> 29:27.337
Is that his BAU BAU?

29:27.477 --> 29:27.717
No!

29:28.678 --> 29:32.140
That's me agreeing.

29:32.160 --> 29:40.284
You know, a cloud could be a cloud and run as fast as he wants and be free in that beautiful blue sky there.

29:40.684 --> 29:41.044
But no!

29:41.404 --> 29:44.066
Instead, he decides, I want to wear this little jacket.

29:44.646 --> 29:46.787
I want to be a bit of a lazy baby.

29:46.807 --> 29:49.628
And I want to cuddle with you!

29:49.648 --> 29:51.349
Be by your side.

29:51.449 --> 29:52.230
Lazy baby.

29:53.473 --> 29:54.954
I just want to be a lazy baby.

29:55.454 --> 29:57.635
Sometimes we all want to be a lazy baby, right?

29:58.115 --> 29:58.896
Sometimes.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.058
BAU BAU!

30:02.278 --> 30:03.378
BAU BAU!

30:03.798 --> 30:04.679
It's not a bad thing.

30:04.699 --> 30:06.520
It's not a bad thing.

30:07.580 --> 30:08.781
No bullying!

30:08.881 --> 30:10.082
It's not bullying!

30:10.222 --> 30:12.543
We're not bullying flowers or tea.

30:12.563 --> 30:12.603
No.

30:13.303 --> 30:14.344
No.

30:14.904 --> 30:15.344
Yeah.

30:16.045 --> 30:16.225
Well.

30:19.585 --> 30:20.866
You've been going for walks, right?

30:21.767 --> 30:22.147
Right!

30:22.668 --> 30:24.329
It's the summer time!

30:24.449 --> 30:26.230
I know it's hot, but the weather is nice.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.552
Beautiful weather!

30:27.572 --> 30:27.772
Right!

30:28.132 --> 30:29.013
So let's take a walk.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.074
Where have you been going for a walk today?

30:31.515 --> 30:33.597
Today I went on a walk!

30:33.757 --> 30:34.998
We have De-den!

30:36.416 --> 30:38.318
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:38.398 --> 30:40.420
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

30:54.335 --> 30:56.037
That's like a kind of green water, huh?

30:57.018 --> 30:57.518
Right.

30:57.538 --> 30:58.439
Is that a good thing?

30:58.459 --> 31:00.861
Yeah, it's a beautiful beach.

31:01.302 --> 31:04.105
But, you found some treasures there too.

31:04.385 --> 31:06.267
A horse, a horseshoe crab shell?

31:06.307 --> 31:07.128
A horse, a horse.

31:07.168 --> 31:08.309
Not a horse, a horseshoe crab.

31:08.349 --> 31:09.210
A full horse.

31:10.493 --> 31:11.834
Horses on beaches too, right?

31:12.034 --> 31:12.935
It could be possible.

31:13.416 --> 31:16.398
And some pebbles too!

31:17.539 --> 31:22.763
You know, that's the most... The best thing about just going for a walk is the little treasures that you find.

31:22.783 --> 31:26.607
I'm just so happy that you had an amazing adventure!

31:26.707 --> 31:30.450
And on a day with such great weather too!

31:30.470 --> 31:33.352
I feel like I can hear the waves of the sound.

31:33.672 --> 31:34.533
The waves of the picture.

31:39.096 --> 31:44.138
I hope you enjoyed the beach a lot!

31:44.158 --> 31:45.358
BAU BAU!

31:45.538 --> 31:45.899
Next!

31:46.079 --> 31:48.800
Ruffians, we got a question from you!

31:49.160 --> 31:52.101
FUWAMOCO, what's the Question of the Day today?

31:52.241 --> 31:53.481
De-den!

31:53.742 --> 31:55.482
Hi Fuwawa and Mococo!

31:55.842 --> 31:57.823
How are you?

31:59.004 --> 32:02.305
We're feeling fluffy and fuzzy.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.386
I have a question about your name.

32:05.726 --> 32:08.827
Do you have a preference for how Ruffians write it?

32:09.408 --> 32:10.408
FUWAMOCO!

32:10.828 --> 32:11.749
FuwaMoco?

32:12.269 --> 32:12.969
Fuwamoco?

32:13.469 --> 32:14.210
'fuwamoco.'

32:15.110 --> 32:17.151
FWMC FUWAMOCO.

32:18.622 --> 32:20.224
'fwmc' fuwamoco.

32:20.884 --> 32:22.246
Something else?

32:22.286 --> 32:23.307
Does it not matter?

32:23.707 --> 32:25.789
BAU BAU!

32:26.470 --> 32:31.154
Ruffians, what do you think is the best answer for this question?

32:31.194 --> 32:33.136
We'll throw the question back at you!

32:33.156 --> 32:35.578
I'm just curious.

32:36.139 --> 32:37.961
Your answers aren't going to change the answer, huh?

32:41.624 --> 32:42.405
FUWAMOCO.

32:43.453 --> 32:44.454
FUWAMOCO!

32:44.474 --> 32:45.855
FUWAMOCO!

32:46.375 --> 32:47.636
FUWAMOCO!

32:47.656 --> 32:50.137
FWMC FUWAMOCO!

32:50.157 --> 32:52.459
Oh, I see.

32:52.539 --> 32:55.140
It's a really good question!

32:55.320 --> 32:56.201
FUWAMOCO!

32:56.321 --> 33:01.504
We prefer 'FUWAMOCO' in all caps best, you know?

33:01.784 --> 33:06.127
Yeah, and then if you're gonna shorten it... Shorten it, because sometimes you don't have enough letters.

33:06.147 --> 33:06.627
Yeah.

33:06.827 --> 33:09.389
'FWMC' in all caps too.

33:11.270 --> 33:11.891
FUWAMOCO!

33:30.902 --> 33:31.302
FUWAMOCO!

33:31.342 --> 33:31.803
FUWAMOCO!

33:52.464 --> 33:52.864
Right!

33:52.944 --> 33:55.066
It's a good, it's a really good question.

33:55.546 --> 34:02.350
We see all kinds of FUWAMOCO being written, but the one that makes us ahhh the most is FUWAMOCO!

34:02.370 --> 34:03.991
With all caps.

34:04.412 --> 34:05.312
How about 'MOCOFUWA'?

34:05.652 --> 34:05.832
No.

34:06.213 --> 34:07.734
No.

34:07.774 --> 34:08.894
Right, Moco-chan?

34:09.655 --> 34:10.615
MOCOFUWA.

34:10.735 --> 34:10.956
No.

34:11.396 --> 34:12.917
It's like being put backwards, right?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.252
I don't want a backwards headbutt, okay?

34:17.832 --> 34:17.892
No.

34:17.912 --> 34:18.132
Yeah.

34:18.452 --> 34:19.633
'YOWAZAKO'?!

34:20.294 --> 34:21.835
What are 'YOWAZAKO'?

34:21.875 --> 34:23.676
Where's FUWAMOCO?

34:24.157 --> 34:24.597
Who's that?

34:25.198 --> 34:25.878
I don't know that.

34:26.178 --> 34:26.418
Hi.

34:26.739 --> 34:26.919
Yeah.

34:27.824 --> 34:29.605
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

34:29.645 --> 34:31.747
#FWMCMorning, okay?

34:54.105 --> 34:56.247
Don't think "my walk recently wasn't interesting."

34:56.647 --> 34:58.968
"You know, I'm not gonna submit anything."

34:59.088 --> 35:00.349
No, we're waiting!

35:00.409 --> 35:04.992
You just have to take the photo and tell us what was the best part, okay?

35:05.373 --> 35:06.774
Please, we're waiting, okay?

35:06.814 --> 35:09.055
Please be a part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:09.635 --> 35:11.717
BAU BAU!

35:12.457 --> 35:15.379
Well, Ruffians, we have another stream coming up.

35:15.659 --> 35:18.962
It's a bit of a busy time, but it's the next stream.

35:19.222 --> 35:22.524
We have... FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:25.306 --> 35:36.952
Ruffians, you wouldn't even believe the kind of day we had today, and the day we had yesterday, and the day that we're gonna have tomorrow, and the day that we're gonna have the day after tomorrow!

35:38.357 --> 35:39.938
Yeah.

35:41.039 --> 35:44.420
These demon dogs are working like dogs.

35:44.721 --> 35:48.063
And we're having a bunch of fun too.

35:48.183 --> 35:54.646
We're gonna do our best and we'll see you next on Friday for FUWAMOCO Morning Desh!

35:54.666 --> 35:56.007
But on schedule!

35:56.207 --> 35:57.668
On schedule!

35:58.128 --> 36:00.510
Yeah, so next we have homework day.

36:00.930 --> 36:06.453
But after FUWAMOCO Morning we have Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

36:06.613 --> 36:07.913
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

36:07.993 --> 36:09.094
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

36:09.114 --> 36:09.754
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

36:35.593 --> 36:44.364
And then, after the last advent collab, we're gonna play some Suika game and chat all together with you, our friends!

36:44.644 --> 36:50.792
There may be some changes in the time here, so we hope that maybe you'll be able to stay up late.

36:52.298 --> 36:56.600
Stick around with us a little bit after a bunch of exciting things happening!

36:56.620 --> 36:56.700
Yeah.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.660
That'll make us very happy.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.221
Just a bit of a heads up then.

37:00.261 --> 37:00.501
Yeah.

37:00.881 --> 37:03.062
The next day we're gonna work really hard!

37:03.162 --> 37:03.702
Hard!

37:03.762 --> 37:05.963
Big, big hard work day for us!

37:06.123 --> 37:06.203
Yeah.

37:06.263 --> 37:09.064
It'll make us really happy to be able to see you and chat with you.

37:09.084 --> 37:09.864
A little bit more time.

37:09.964 --> 37:10.084
Yeah.

37:10.324 --> 37:14.446
And fill up our Ruffian batteries before we head off on a big day!

37:14.626 --> 37:14.826
Yeah.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.328
And that's our schedule!

37:17.348 --> 37:19.029
Thank you, Ruffians!

37:19.129 --> 37:29.516
And for the Ruffians who are joining us today through the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO with its BAU BAU justice!

37:29.716 --> 37:32.238
BAU BAU!

37:35.240 --> 37:41.624
