00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.966
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.989
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.071
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:05:19.732 --> 00:05:21.934
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:21.974 --> 00:05:23.675
Moco-chan.

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:28.540
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.643
Is it really starting?

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:33.024
It's starting!

00:05:33.064 --> 00:05:35.886
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:39.818
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.202
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:45.983
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:49.106
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:49.586 --> 00:05:54.170
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:59.775
Thank you for joining us today for our 28th episode, Ruffians!

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:02.437
I started off a bit different, though.

00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:03.698
What are you talking about?

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:04.498
Moco-chan.

00:06:06.474 --> 00:06:08.154
It's normal.

00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:09.735
Fully normal.

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:10.295
All good.

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:11.635
Right, Ruffians?

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:13.315
This is how it always is.

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:32.058
Well, Ruffians, if it's your first time joining us in real time, or maybe not in real time, either is fine, but to explain a little about FUWAMOCO Morning, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:32.619
A.k.a.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:33.499
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.919
And it's hosted by us,

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.001
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:42.947
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:49.233
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:49.794 --> 00:06:53.978
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:54.839
BAU BAU!

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.601
What do we have for today?

00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:04.184
Was Pero seen around again?

00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:07.686
It'd be weird if... Oh, he was!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:10.068
Let's see!

00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:11.629
Why was Pero seen this time?

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:12.349
De-den!

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:15.691
That's a smile.

00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:18.333
Good smile!

00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:18.533
Right!

00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:20.154
But isn't this Doggie of the Day?

00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:20.214
No...

00:07:22.956 --> 00:07:23.837
See, there's Pero.

00:07:23.857 --> 00:07:25.018
This is where Pero is.

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:29.463
He's kind of gotten himself into a situation.

00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:31.505
He's made a new friend, right?

00:07:33.407 --> 00:07:35.289
You know they're playing together, right?

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.731
Ruffians playing.

00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:37.612
Playing.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:39.840
Pero likes to get chewed on!

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.320
You think he likes that?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360
Explain!

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.182
You know, he doesn't look like he hates it really, right?

00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:48.823
Wow, he's inside of the sweet chew toy!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:52.144
It kinda looks like a chocolate korone, right?

00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:53.545
And Pero's a chocolate!

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:54.845
Yeah.

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:56.026
I guess I can see that.

00:07:56.706 --> 00:08:02.368
Oh, but I guess this doggy likes to eat the korone from the tip, huh?

00:08:02.468 --> 00:08:03.708
What about you, Mococo?

00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:06.209
Do you eat the korone from the tip or the face?

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:12.361
I feel like I have to sneeze.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:18.174
Answer the question, Moco-chan!

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:26.863
Ruffians, how about you answer for me?

00:08:27.344 --> 00:08:30.086
Do you eat the korone from the face?

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:31.487
Or from the tip?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.982
Korone is always sort of chocolate inside, so... I have a classic Korone.

00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:56.783
Chuu chuu chuu.

00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:58.644
Class 2.

00:08:59.484 --> 00:09:04.627
And for Pero though, I don't really know if... If he makes this yummy.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.408
If he makes it not so yummy.

00:09:07.408 --> 00:09:13.331
I don't even know if this red chewy thing... Does it taste good?

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.434
Ruffians, we definitely haven't chewed on it before, so...

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.092
We're demon dogs, thank you.

00:09:20.132 --> 00:09:20.372
Yes.

00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:21.353
We're not dogs.

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:22.114
No.

00:09:22.574 --> 00:09:24.977
But, uh, hopefully it tastes good.

00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:26.598
Hopefully Pero makes it taste better.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:26.979
Yeah.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.120
I don't know.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.560
BAU BAU!

00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:32.024
I would rather have custard.

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:33.966
Yeah, not the Pero filling.

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:34.246
Yeah.

00:09:34.286 --> 00:09:34.727
No, no.

00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:35.047
Custard.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.460
Thank you!

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.841
Ruffians, please let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:46.604
You can let us know with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:47.664
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:52.527
Oh, it feels like that was the Doggie of the Day.

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:53.167
So cute!

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:54.728
That smile!

00:09:55.368 --> 00:09:56.088
When was it?

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:57.049
I know!

00:09:58.089 --> 00:09:58.870
Yesterday!

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.872
I mentioned it during our pair social stream last night, but...

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.313
I had a strange dream, right?

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:10.335
Oh, it's been a long time since we had a dream to share with the Ruffians.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:14.077
I feel like I keep on forgetting, but... I remember this one.

00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:20.641
Okay, it wasn't really all that interesting, but... It was a bit more strange and unsettling.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.282
Unsettling?

00:10:23.262 --> 00:10:24.943
I don't know, it's not that important.

00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:28.565
But did you want to hear it?

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:30.166
Not violent.

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:31.186
Not violent dream.

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:31.446
No.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:45.904
So, in my dream, I was cleaning and dusting our place and when I tried to reach a really high up area in the curtains, right?

00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:48.846
Because you know when you're dusting you have to go up high too, right?

00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:58.751
So, for some reason I bumped my head on this top part of the curtains that was like protected by a hard cover or a wood cover or something.

00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:01.553
It wasn't that bad of a bump, but...

00:11:02.293 --> 00:11:03.014
Okay, that's good.

00:11:03.154 --> 00:11:07.337
But there was lots of dust and junk that got all over my head and my ears.

00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:14.702
So I was panicking because I wasn't really sure what was in the massive layer of junk and gross stuff.

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:16.704
I was trying to get it off my head.

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:23.889
But no matter how much I tried to brush it off, just more dust and cobwebs would fall off.

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:28.512
Just more dust, more cobwebs, more dust, more cobwebs.

00:11:29.653 --> 00:11:29.753
Yeah.

00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:37.687
I was really worried because I thought maybe there might be spiders and maybe they might get my ears.

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:42.468
But I was also worried because I thought, I can't see the Ruffians like this!

00:11:43.248 --> 00:11:44.449
And then the dream ended.

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:47.149
Strange, huh?

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.690
I thought it ended like a happy dream.

00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:52.111
I woke up.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.512
But it's a good thing because it was just a dream, yeah.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:56.592
Right, right.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.374
No spiders in your ears, yeah.

00:11:58.394 --> 00:12:00.255
You can see the Ruffians right now.

00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:01.676
Ears are nice and clean.

00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:02.736
Oh good.

00:12:03.297 --> 00:12:04.237
Wonder what it means?

00:12:04.297 --> 00:12:05.438
Don't look into it!

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:09.681
It's just a dream, there's lots of them.

00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:12.263
It's not a scary dream, it's just unsettling.

00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:16.906
Sounds like a nightmare!

00:12:18.387 --> 00:12:19.347
It was just a dream.

00:12:20.788 --> 00:12:20.948
Yup.

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:24.129
You wanted to hear it.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:26.770
BAU BAU!

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.492
Thank you for sharing, Moco-chan.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:30.212
You're welcome.

00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:36.215
Do we have some happy news?

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:38.077
I think so.

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:48.542
You know, Ruffians, last time we kind of inadvertently made a misunderstanding for ourselves, right?

00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:49.743
But,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.643
This time, look, Ruffians!

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.344
We did it!

00:12:56.444 --> 00:13:00.347
There haven't been any more misunderstandings!

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:07.872
Maybe we're improving, Moco-chan.

00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:09.173
I think we are.

00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:13.720
This means October is starting off very nice!

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.001
Yay!

00:13:15.602 --> 00:13:17.403
Good start to October, right?

00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:20.946
Hopefully this can be a mostly misunderstanding brief.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.247
FUWAMOCTOBER!

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:24.709
FUWAMOCTOBER.

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:26.571
FUWAMOCTOBER!

00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:29.632
What do you say?

00:13:29.713 --> 00:13:31.373
What do you mean, Ruffians?

00:13:31.714 --> 00:13:33.194
You did it, thank you.

00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:35.155
We did it together.

00:13:35.175 --> 00:13:36.476
Yeah.

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.097
But October already started?

00:13:38.597 --> 00:13:39.417
It just started.

00:13:39.798 --> 00:13:40.558
Yeah.

00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:41.438
Just a start.

00:13:41.498 --> 00:13:43.379
We're not talking about all of October.

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:44.180
Just a start.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.302
It'd be nice if all of October would be like, that would be a lot of days without misunderstanding.

00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:51.203
Can we keep it for the whole month?

00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:52.364
Can we?

00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.325
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:13:55.946 --> 00:13:57.086
We're on a good track.

00:13:57.527 --> 00:13:58.027
Good job.

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:00.573
Nope.

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:03.054
Nope with the period.

00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:05.094
Ignore it.

00:14:05.414 --> 00:14:06.334
Probably not.

00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:07.355
BAU BAU!

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.835
Thanks for the positivity, Ruffians.

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:12.916
BAU BAU!

00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:15.936
Well, it's not just that though.

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:20.377
Ruffians, we have a bit of a confession to make.

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:22.777
Do we?

00:14:23.457 --> 00:14:24.718
A little bit, Moco-chan.

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.018
You know...

00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:35.491
You know, recently, Ruffians, we've been trying to change our Twitter usage so, you know, that we can connect a bit more closely to you.

00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:36.291
Yeah.

00:14:37.052 --> 00:14:37.852
Have you noticed?

00:14:40.092 --> 00:14:45.814
But, I don't know, I kind of feel that maybe it's taking a turn for the worse?

00:14:46.294 --> 00:14:50.475
Because, uh... Moco-chan, Moco-chan, you have something to say, right?

00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:51.755
Do I?

00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:53.736
Something to confess!

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:56.648
I guess.

00:14:57.669 --> 00:14:58.249
Maybe.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.133
I guess sometimes when we tweet, of course, I'll read all your responses.

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:07.333
Thank you.

00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:09.114
Yeah, thank you.

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:15.937
But sometimes, it just makes me a little bit more curious, you know?

00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:20.019
So then, I get curious.

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:25.251
And I go to the profile of Ruffians who just tweeted back at us.

00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:27.752
And I look at who they're following.

00:15:28.113 --> 00:15:30.775
Just to see, like, who they're interested in, right?

00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:32.436
You know, I'm just curious.

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:33.316
Just curious.

00:15:33.797 --> 00:15:45.645
You know, sometimes I see a lot of cute girls and I think... Sometimes, good taste.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:47.046
Sometimes,

00:15:50.502 --> 00:15:51.183
Questionable.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:55.990
And then I go over to the responses!

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.432
Like anyone normal.

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:59.776
And I see them chatting with other Ruffians!

00:16:00.357 --> 00:16:02.520
And it makes me really happy, yeah.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.902
I see that a lot too.

00:16:04.872 --> 00:16:06.033
Ruffian.

00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:13.178
You know, we talked about it before, but we're really happy to see you getting along all together.

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:16.681
It makes me feel like I want to work even harder too.

00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:16.981
Right!

00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:18.863
Be happy together, okay?

00:16:20.284 --> 00:16:24.387
And you know, and then I just go over to the likes and I think... Hmm...

00:16:28.018 --> 00:16:31.321
Is this a way to connect with you better?

00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:42.018
Moco-chan.

00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:01.995
I don't know.

00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:03.416
I guess.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:06.378
It's not really a confession, just sort of like a thought.

00:17:06.778 --> 00:17:07.178
You know?

00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:10.159
Sort of thing.

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:10.860
I guess.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.961
Yeah!

00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:15.182
Well, we confessed!

00:17:15.262 --> 00:17:17.683
Now you know, Ruffians!

00:17:18.123 --> 00:17:18.863
No!

00:17:18.923 --> 00:17:20.604
This is how we're using Twitter now.

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:22.125
Stop it!

00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:22.945
Enjoy it!

00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:33.906
There's a lot of different ways to use social media, right?

00:17:34.747 --> 00:17:36.828
That's one of the ways we will do it.

00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:37.548
BAU BAU!

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:45.105
I think this is kind of happy.

00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:47.427
Is it kind of happy?

00:17:47.487 --> 00:17:49.949
Has FUWAMOCO Morning not been happy up until now?

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:51.891
I don't know, but Ruffians!

00:17:52.532 --> 00:18:01.700
You know how at the end of every FUWAMOCO Morning, there are a handful of special Ruffians who are chosen to get their dreams better, right?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.381
Right!

00:18:03.502 --> 00:18:03.982
Wow!

00:18:06.741 --> 00:18:15.665
We figured that there are probably a lot of Ruffians that want to be a special Ruffian of the day too, right?

00:18:34.873 --> 00:18:45.627
Alright, so we thought maybe we can have a bit of a battle play with you and share some more strategic tips on how maybe you can raise your chances of being chosen.

00:18:46.288 --> 00:18:47.289
Yeah!

00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:51.048
Well, Ruffians, what do you think?

00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:53.992
I mean, Ruffians have their own strategies.

00:18:54.874 --> 00:18:56.956
Well, from FUWAMOCO!

00:18:57.277 --> 00:19:00.642
Yeah, timing and luck is a huge part of it.

00:19:01.062 --> 00:19:05.829
But also having a name that's rather easy and simple to read in a glance, I think is...

00:19:06.209 --> 00:19:07.550
A big part of it too.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.211
Yeah, right.

00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:15.917
Something that's long and kind of difficult to read really, really quickly might not be the best.

00:19:15.937 --> 00:19:25.324
Yeah, like even though it may be easy, things like maybe FUWAMOCO Ruffian 2023, it might be a bit difficult to just read at a glance, you know?

00:19:26.485 --> 00:19:34.731
We also want to make sure that we pronounce your name as correctly as possible, so if you think maybe we might have a hard time with it, that's something too.

00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:41.260
I see a lot of Ruffians saying they're gonna change their name.

00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:43.383
But we know your name now.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.672
But you know, we're doing our best.

00:19:50.152 --> 00:19:51.412
Pronunciation's important.

00:19:51.432 --> 00:19:55.153
We want to make sure that you understand that we called out your name.

00:19:55.313 --> 00:19:59.594
If we say it a bit far away, then that's going to be disappointing.

00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:02.515
We sometimes fumble names so hard.

00:20:02.575 --> 00:20:03.175
We do.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:06.996
I also store a name in my head once I find one.

00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:10.217
And until I have a moment to it, so I can say it.

00:20:12.017 --> 00:20:13.258
Good luck, Ruffians!

00:20:13.318 --> 00:20:14.258
Happy BAU BAUing!

00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:22.221
I'm sure that one day you can become a special Ruffian of the FUWAMOCO Morning, but...

00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:32.845
I want you to also remember that you're always the special Ruffian in our hearts.

00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:34.905
It's just a silly bonus thing, okay?

00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:37.706
So don't be sad if you can't make the special Ruffian.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:39.647
It's just a silly bonus, okay?

00:20:39.747 --> 00:20:44.708
And yeah, if you have a long last name, don't worry about it, okay?

00:20:45.128 --> 00:20:46.829
We'll probably just pick the first name.

00:20:49.763 --> 00:20:53.310
It's way up?

00:20:54.092 --> 00:21:10.625
Maybe because I just saw it. Silly bonus. Exactly! Don't take it in stride. Yes, take it in stride, Don't worry about it. Not don't take it in stride. Okay, understood?

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:11.387
Good, good. Very easy.

00:21:13.463 --> 00:21:13.763
BAU BAU

00:21:16.564 --> 00:21:18.325
Good luck with your driving exam.

00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:20.626
You thought I wouldn't see that, huh?

00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:24.748
BAU BAU!

00:21:25.068 --> 00:21:27.129
Speaking of special Ruffians.

00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:28.809
Ruffians!

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.090
RuffianS!

00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:37.353
We actually received something very special from you, the other day.

00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:39.454
We got a present.

00:21:40.594 --> 00:21:42.455
We saw it on Twitter!

00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:43.196
I wonder why.

00:21:44.795 --> 00:21:46.776
Here we take a look at FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:53.900
You know, Ruffians, it seems like a bunch of you gathered all together to do something very special!

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.783
To sing our original introduction to Lifetime Showtime together as a group!

00:21:59.823 --> 00:22:03.925
This is from Ruffian 5000 who uploaded it.

00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:05.246
We're so happy!

00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:07.107
Let's listen, let's listen!

00:22:07.387 --> 00:22:07.627
Okay.

00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:09.748
Okay, okay.

00:22:09.968 --> 00:22:11.489
Use your ears, okay Ruffians?

00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:13.050
Okay, here we go!

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:22.853
That's not you, that's me.

00:22:22.873 --> 00:22:23.753
I'm Moco-chan.

00:22:23.773 --> 00:22:24.334
Bye kawaii!

00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:51.232
It's showtime, it's showtime.

00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:22.279
I'm ready!

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.441
Oh, here it comes.

00:23:24.561 --> 00:23:26.583
It's a bit different, ready?

00:23:37.446 --> 00:24:05.403
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:24:05.763 --> 00:24:10.767
Very precious and unique to you, so you can be really nervous when singing.

00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:14.510
You know, especially to record it and then have it heard by others.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.875
Especially when maybe you're still new to singing, too.

00:24:20.015 --> 00:24:22.197
It really means a ton to us.

00:24:22.437 --> 00:24:23.197
Thank you!

00:24:23.237 --> 00:24:27.421
I know you worked all together to make something for us.

00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:28.122
We really...

00:24:30.305 --> 00:24:31.767
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:24:47.964 --> 00:24:48.765
Moco-chan's part, right?

00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:04.702
Good job!

00:25:04.762 --> 00:25:05.983
Don't wait, don't wait.

00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:09.386
It's a lot of courage needed to do that.

00:25:09.406 --> 00:25:11.348
A lot of courage, a lot of passion.

00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:14.731
All Ruffians are voice haters!

00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:16.693
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:22.038
We're really happy to be able to hear your voices.

00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:23.920
It was wonderful.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.342
BAU BAU!

00:25:29.554 --> 00:25:32.356
Such a happy present, the best present.

00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:34.938
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.622
I guess the Ruffians have been nice today.

00:25:40.042 --> 00:25:41.063
Extra nice, right?

00:25:41.143 --> 00:25:42.684
Nice today.

00:25:42.704 --> 00:25:47.528
You know, I guess Wednesdays can be a bit rough.

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:50.770
I wanted to say something!

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.911
Hey!

00:25:59.253 --> 00:25:59.694
Hey!

00:26:00.774 --> 00:26:02.395
It's me, Mococo!

00:26:03.956 --> 00:26:05.677
And you know what this means!

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:07.558
Yeah!

00:26:08.038 --> 00:26:11.780
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:16.143
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.225
You are still sleepy, are you?

00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:26.028
You're awake, right?

00:26:28.422 --> 00:26:30.804
Oh, you want five more minutes?

00:26:33.866 --> 00:26:35.447
Okay, that's fine.

00:26:35.848 --> 00:26:41.251
If those five minutes mean that you'll have that much more energy to take on today, that's fine!

00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:44.094
Don't be too hard on yourself for it.

00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:45.655
It's Wednesday!

00:26:46.644 --> 00:26:49.445
It's okay to give yourself a little bit of wiggle room on things.

00:26:49.865 --> 00:26:51.926
Not everything needs to be perfect, okay?

00:26:52.546 --> 00:26:54.907
No matter what, it'll be okay!

00:26:55.668 --> 00:26:56.888
You can do the scary thing.

00:26:57.468 --> 00:26:58.669
You can get over it!

00:26:59.569 --> 00:27:03.671
It can be productive, even if it's just a bit, and not as much as maybe you had hoped.

00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:04.471
Okay?

00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:08.253
Let's take as many steps as we can together today.

00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:10.502
Just keep looking forward.

00:27:11.343 --> 00:27:15.626
And before you know it, we'll be somewhere new and amazing all together!

00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:17.347
You can do it!

00:27:18.107 --> 00:27:18.908
We believe in you.

00:27:22.431 --> 00:27:25.933
Ganbatte ne!

00:27:25.953 --> 00:27:27.494
BAU BAU!

00:27:27.534 --> 00:27:30.156
BAU BAU!

00:27:30.196 --> 00:27:32.098
Thank you!

00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:33.839
Wise words from Moco-chan, huh?

00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:34.719
I'm always wise.

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:35.280
BAU MOCO-CHAN!

00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:40.653
Shall we head to our regular quarters?

00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:42.197
Oh, Doggie of the Day!

00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:46.441
It's Griffin!

00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.582
Griffin's the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:48.862 --> 00:27:51.482
He doesn't look like a griffin, he looks like a doggy.

00:27:51.643 --> 00:27:51.943
Really?

00:27:51.963 --> 00:27:52.943
Well, I don't even know.

00:27:53.343 --> 00:27:57.404
I think Griffin may be tiny, but he's very dignified.

00:27:57.504 --> 00:28:00.765
I feel like the name Griffin really suits him.

00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:02.085
You don't think so, Moco-chan?

00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:04.765
He's like a... a griffin nugget.

00:28:05.746 --> 00:28:07.006
A griffin nugget?

00:28:07.046 --> 00:28:07.846
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:11.387
I don't know, but his bark is really big too.

00:28:11.407 --> 00:28:11.887
I feel like...

00:28:12.711 --> 00:28:13.613
I like his nose.

00:28:23.749 --> 00:28:24.309
Ah, his nose?

00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:26.331
What are you gonna do to that, Moco-chan?

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.173
I'm gonna boop it.

00:28:29.953 --> 00:28:34.356
I kinda wanna touch the little underneath the chin.

00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:35.437
Is that his beard?

00:28:35.537 --> 00:28:36.197
The beard!

00:28:36.437 --> 00:28:37.478
You wanna touch the beard!

00:28:37.498 --> 00:28:39.039
I wanna touch Griffin's beard!

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:43.442
What's this Griffin's big BAU BAU sound like?

00:28:46.178 --> 00:28:46.819
BAU BAU!

00:28:58.263 --> 00:29:08.433
I think that kind of BAU BAU would be really well because you know Griffin is wild and tiny which is like good to be able to get all the mean people around you.

00:29:08.473 --> 00:29:13.678
The mean people that want to hurt your smile to get them to drop their guard and get them scared.

00:29:13.698 --> 00:29:16.100
You'd be scared if you heard something like BAU BAU!

00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:17.181
Right?

00:29:19.084 --> 00:29:21.568
Are you gonna... Are you gonna...

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:34.880
Griffin's just good at his job.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:40.162
I'm gonna give Griffin something to BAU BAU at.

00:29:40.562 --> 00:29:47.905
But you know, I think Griffin's very happy to be able to protect you to be able to give a loud BAU BAU.

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:51.706
Because that means that Griffin now gets it all to himself.

00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:54.207
BAU BAU!

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:56.128
Thank you!

00:29:57.168 --> 00:29:58.109
And for today!

00:29:58.973 --> 00:30:00.794
Did a Ruffian go on a nice walk?

00:30:00.874 --> 00:30:01.334
I should hope.

00:30:01.854 --> 00:30:02.674
You should hope.

00:30:02.754 --> 00:30:03.555
I should hope.

00:30:03.575 --> 00:30:06.275
The weather's not the nicest maybe, but let's see!

00:30:07.376 --> 00:30:08.876
Today I went on a walk.

00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:09.937
Where did we go?

00:30:10.077 --> 00:30:10.777
De-den!

00:30:12.838 --> 00:30:13.378
A river?

00:30:13.398 --> 00:30:15.378
Today I walked by the river in the rain.

00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:16.019
I got wet.

00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:16.999
Extra wet.

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:17.319
Let's...

00:30:23.248 --> 00:30:27.010
I think that one of them really were fussy.

00:30:29.151 --> 00:30:32.473
I love it when it's soaked on.

00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:33.554
It's confusing.

00:30:33.654 --> 00:30:40.557
Are you soaked by the rain, the river, or Moco-chan's knee?

00:30:40.657 --> 00:30:45.960
Please make sure that you don't get wet or anything because it'd be really bad if you caught a cold.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.961
But you know we're proud of you!

00:30:48.261 --> 00:30:50.082
Even though maybe it's not the nicest.

00:30:50.142 --> 00:30:51.043
Yeah, we find it

00:30:51.203 --> 00:30:54.784
It's so hard to go out on a walk on rainy days.

00:30:55.064 --> 00:30:58.205
We don't want to become wet dogs, you know.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:01.266
That will never happen.

00:31:01.286 --> 00:31:03.086
We're good people.

00:31:03.106 --> 00:31:05.187
But we hope you had lots of fun.

00:31:05.847 --> 00:31:09.588
Maybe you spotted some cool fish or animals too.

00:31:09.748 --> 00:31:10.528
Or raindrops.

00:31:10.988 --> 00:31:11.408
That too.

00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:12.388
BAU BAU!

00:31:12.488 --> 00:31:14.489
Thank you!

00:31:16.564 --> 00:31:18.505
Do we have a question from a Ruffian?

00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:21.107
Ruffian boys have such good questions.

00:31:21.327 --> 00:31:22.188
I know, right?

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:22.888
It's tricky.

00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:24.950
We have... De-den!

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.311
BAU BAU!

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:29.513
What is a typical FUWAMOCO morning routine?

00:31:29.873 --> 00:31:32.115
I don't... Ah, FUWAMOCO morning... Ah, there's not a cap.

00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:33.497
I get it, I get it.

00:31:33.577 --> 00:31:41.667
I don't have much of a routine, so I was wondering what is most important for you girls in the time from when you wake up to when you start the day off.

00:31:42.147 --> 00:31:44.350
Also, this is extremely important.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.673
What's the shampoo you use?

00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:48.335
Is that extremely important?

00:31:50.957 --> 00:31:53.919
FUWAMOCO's morning routine, right?

00:31:53.959 --> 00:31:55.340
No, FUWAMOCO morning routine.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.301
Which one?

00:31:56.541 --> 00:32:01.004
I think if it was FUWAMOCO morning routine, then that's like, morning should be capitalized, right?

00:32:01.124 --> 00:32:04.566
FUWAMOCO's apostrophe S morning routine versus FUWAMOCO morning routine.

00:32:04.586 --> 00:32:15.893
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:32:16.903 --> 00:32:17.323
Day off?

00:32:17.724 --> 00:32:18.764
Really?

00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:19.705
I'm waiting.

00:32:19.785 --> 00:32:20.225
I'm waiting.

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:20.786
I'm waiting.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:25.369
When we wake up, we do some stretches.

00:32:25.969 --> 00:32:33.014
We have breakfast while, you know, watching some simple, happy, educational, maybe Japanese TV.

00:32:33.054 --> 00:32:34.335
Japanese TV stuff.

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:39.319
And then we get responding on some messages and working on homework while preparing.

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:42.522
For whatever stream we have coming up next, you know.

00:32:43.463 --> 00:32:45.885
No, not drinking shampoo, no.

00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:50.489
That's not part of the morning routine.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.133
But some days are a bit sleepier than others, you know.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:08.273
Yeah, somewhere in the day though, we also like to go for a nice walk too, but there's also other days that no matter how beautiful it is, we're just too busy and we can't get outside.

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:09.714
Is this a morning routine?

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:11.654
Oh, this is a full day routine.

00:33:11.714 --> 00:33:12.475
Is that okay?

00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:15.335
It's okay!

00:33:16.656 --> 00:33:18.116
Yeah.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:22.858
But yeah, yesterday was one of those days where we just couldn't get out either.

00:33:23.358 --> 00:33:24.158
But, uh,

00:33:24.637 --> 00:33:34.740
After we finish our evening session or bedtime, we like to both take baths to calm down and then also we can kind of respond to messages too.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.081
Do more stretches, that's a nice start.

00:33:38.101 --> 00:33:39.802
Try to sleep.

00:33:39.842 --> 00:33:40.902
Get to sleep from there.

00:33:42.558 --> 00:33:44.799
I feel like we're very lucky that it's rather simple.

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:45.359
Simple.

00:33:46.579 --> 00:33:50.560
Some Ruffians have a much more busy daily routine going on.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.161
But as for shampoo though, it's an extremely important question, right?

00:33:57.181 --> 00:34:01.742
We recently changed to a different demon- a guard dog shampoo.

00:34:01.982 --> 00:34:03.502
Yeah, it was recommended.

00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:04.023
It was.

00:34:04.123 --> 00:34:10.404
But it's a bit expensive, so... You know, I thought about it for a long time and then I decided.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:11.790
No.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.870
No.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.992
But as for the scent, it just smells nice.

00:34:30.012 --> 00:34:30.212
Yeah.

00:34:30.232 --> 00:34:31.753
I don't know what it smells like.

00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:32.894
It smells nice though.

00:34:33.014 --> 00:34:33.734
It smells nice.

00:34:34.354 --> 00:34:34.935
Nice scent.

00:34:34.975 --> 00:34:36.196
Wait, dog, no!

00:34:36.336 --> 00:34:36.956
It's nice scent.

00:34:36.976 --> 00:34:37.156
Yeah.

00:34:37.236 --> 00:34:37.536
BAU BAU!

00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:39.057
Thank you for the question!

00:34:45.121 --> 00:34:47.863
I love it when things are sent in nicely.

00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:54.967
FUWAMOCO-chan, let's take a look at our next team before the time runs out here.

00:34:55.407 --> 00:34:59.770
Our next team is... De-den!

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.110
It's a busy day.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.812
We're streaming twice more after this.

00:35:03.832 --> 00:35:04.352
Today.

00:35:04.913 --> 00:35:06.133
Today.

00:35:06.193 --> 00:35:10.496
We'll be collabing with some of our EN Senpai and element members in a game called

00:35:11.052 --> 00:35:13.033
Party animals.

00:35:13.073 --> 00:35:13.473
That's us.

00:35:13.513 --> 00:35:14.634
Yeah, that's us.

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:24.139
We'll have to run and punch and grab and try to stay top dog amongst all the other animals.

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:29.002
Moco-chan, let's make sure that we show our senpai all the respect that they deserve, okay?

00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:30.343
With punches.

00:35:34.142 --> 00:35:36.943
We have punches!

00:35:36.963 --> 00:35:37.663
Respect!

00:35:37.984 --> 00:35:45.786
And after that, we're gonna be beginning our journey in Resident Evil 4 Remake!

00:35:46.586 --> 00:35:50.488
It looks really, really scary, but we'll do our best.

00:35:50.508 --> 00:35:51.728
We have weapons, right?

00:35:51.788 --> 00:35:53.649
And make sure you're logged into...

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:10.933
So it is maybe any younger Ruffians that maybe you can just join us for Party Animals and we'll see you next time right for Suica Game!

00:36:11.233 --> 00:36:18.395
But Ruffians that are old enough, make sure you're logged in, okay?

00:36:18.755 --> 00:36:19.415
It's a warning.

00:36:19.855 --> 00:36:20.597
Oh, a warning.

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:21.299
A warning.

00:36:21.419 --> 00:36:23.665
What's gonna happen if the Ruffians are voted?

00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:24.948
Can't watch.

00:36:26.533 --> 00:36:27.114
That's true.

00:36:27.134 --> 00:36:28.237
That sounds pretty bad.

00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:31.463
BAU BAU!

00:36:51.986 --> 00:36:55.047
We're going to sing whatever songs we feel like!

00:36:56.187 --> 00:36:57.807
Whatever songs we can sing.

00:36:58.187 --> 00:36:59.228
Not an archive.

00:36:59.408 --> 00:36:59.948
Archive.

00:37:00.108 --> 00:37:07.229
FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party is always archived unless we say so.

00:37:08.689 --> 00:37:13.510
But this time we're gonna challenge ourselves to sing some new songs too, right Moco-chan?

00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:16.051
But also other songs too.

00:37:18.229 --> 00:37:21.516
You have to join us for lots more BAUing deshita!

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:24.676

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.301
Thank you!

00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:32.742
We shared some strategies.

00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:34.503
Now's the time!

00:37:34.983 --> 00:37:41.929
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
