04:58.357 --> 05:00.901
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:00.921 --> 05:05.309
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:05.769 --> 05:09.656
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:09.696 --> 05:10.056
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:13.251 --> 05:16.333
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:16.453 --> 05:17.513
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:17.573 --> 05:22.296
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:22.396 --> 05:26.879
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:27.259 --> 05:28.560
Thank you for joining us!

05:32.017 --> 05:36.040
Have you enjoyed the past two days... ...of Advent debuts.

05:37.721 --> 05:46.846
It's been a busy two days for hololive English -Advent- members like us, and Biboo, and Shiori, and Nerissa, but...

05:47.927 --> 05:48.848
Did you enjoy them?

05:48.888 --> 05:49.928
Did you watch them?

05:50.869 --> 05:53.550
Did you enjoy the two days of Advent debuts?

05:56.380 --> 05:57.161
How was it?

05:57.241 --> 05:57.821
How was it?

05:58.281 --> 05:59.042
How's it been?

05:59.342 --> 06:00.943
We hope you enjoyed them!

06:01.644 --> 06:03.885
Did you find a new oshi, maybe?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.967
It's always good to get new favorites.

06:07.047 --> 06:20.376
Well... Today is a very special day because this is the pilot episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:21.797 --> 06:23.138
Does it seem kind of mysterious?

06:23.318 --> 06:24.939
Is it mysterious?

06:25.359 --> 06:32.704
Well, maybe a happy mysterious, but... Yes, FUWAMOCO Morning is not that mysterious.

06:33.004 --> 06:38.307
It's our special live program held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:38.447 --> 06:39.668
FUWAMOCO.

06:39.988 --> 06:43.150
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:43.290 --> 06:44.751
Surprise!

06:44.871 --> 06:47.252
It's a short format morning show.

06:47.332 --> 06:49.814
I guess it might be a late night show.

06:50.274 --> 06:51.455
Which one is it for you?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.255
What time is it?

06:52.595 --> 06:53.476
Is it a morning show?

06:53.556 --> 06:54.897
Is it a late night show?

06:55.037 --> 06:56.458
Or is it a... Should we change the name?

06:57.658 --> 06:58.459
Yeah, which one?

07:00.200 --> 07:00.840
Morning?

07:01.521 --> 07:02.041
Morning?

07:02.401 --> 07:03.101
Afternoon?

07:03.121 --> 07:05.283
Late night, late night.

07:05.303 --> 07:06.844
FUWAMOCO Morning in your heart.

07:06.964 --> 07:12.927
But if it's like "FUWAMOCO Night Time", that's a different kind of show, no?

07:14.773 --> 07:15.874
FUWAMOCO in your heart.

07:16.554 --> 07:19.316
Morning in your heart, but also FUWAMOCO in your heart.

07:21.617 --> 07:31.043
FUWAMOCO Morning, what we aim to do is we aim to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:32.444 --> 07:37.847
You might have noticed with our schedule, but we're really hoping to start our day together with you.

07:39.028 --> 07:40.029
And together.

07:40.089 --> 07:43.290
You know, playing fun games and doing other different things.

07:43.390 --> 07:48.973
And that way we can all have a really happy, healthy life routine all together.

07:48.993 --> 07:49.873
Yeah, it's important.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.915
We need you Ruffians in good shape, okay?

07:52.975 --> 07:55.036
You gotta stay tip-top healthy.

07:55.096 --> 07:58.317
You have to be the hot dog of every day.

07:59.678 --> 08:00.298
Right?

08:00.618 --> 08:01.419
Is that okay?

08:03.103 --> 08:04.503
You're good with being healthy, right?

08:06.704 --> 08:09.365
Well, maybe it might happen whether you like it or not.

08:09.465 --> 08:15.547
Anyways, we'd be really honored if you could spend time with us like this.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.227
And Japanese too!

08:17.247 --> 08:18.088
Before we forget!

08:18.328 --> 08:19.528
FUWAMOCO Morning is...

08:23.396 --> 08:27.401
FUWAMOCO Morning is a regular morning variety show.

08:27.481 --> 08:33.628
I know it's a bit late for everyone in Japan, but our goal is to help you start your day off on the right paw.

08:44.505 --> 08:45.806
That's the goal.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.907
That's the goal!

08:46.967 --> 08:47.487
Healthy!

09:13.644 --> 09:23.109
But yeah, today's just the pilot episode, but we really hope that FUWAMOCO Morning can be a really warm, cozy show that we can all enjoy together.

09:23.189 --> 09:30.673
Maybe as you roll out of bed, or maybe on your way to work, or you're like, ahh, today's no good, damida.

09:30.854 --> 09:35.536
Then maybe we can put on FUWAMOCO Morning and be like, okay, I'll get out of bed.

09:35.656 --> 09:37.957
That would make us really happy.

09:39.738 --> 09:41.940
But yeah, since today's the pilot episode,

09:43.024 --> 09:43.784
It's a bit different.

09:43.864 --> 09:44.685
It's a bit different.

09:44.765 --> 09:45.565
It's episode 0, right?

09:45.585 --> 09:45.745
Right?

09:45.825 --> 09:46.685
Episode 0.

09:47.026 --> 09:51.967
Pilot episodes never really end up to be, like, the actual show, right?

09:52.928 --> 09:54.608
Well, we'll all have to find out!

09:54.648 --> 09:55.149
Yeah, right!

09:55.249 --> 09:56.669
It's gonna be a journey.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.590
What does FUWAMOCO Morning become?

09:58.710 --> 09:59.010
Right?

09:59.110 --> 10:00.671
It's still a mystery to us, too.

10:00.751 --> 10:01.011
Yeah.

10:01.411 --> 10:02.692
But... I think it's good like that.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:04.232 --> 10:07.874
But, first and foremost, we have one thing.

10:09.574 --> 10:11.375
We wanted to say...

10:12.199 --> 10:14.460
Big, big thank you!

10:14.480 --> 10:18.201
De-den!

10:18.761 --> 10:24.103
We've reached 300,000 ruffians!

10:24.163 --> 10:24.784
Can you believe it?

10:25.024 --> 10:27.425
We've reached 300,000 ruffians!

10:27.445 --> 10:28.885
It's all thanks to everyone!

10:28.905 --> 10:29.365
Thank you!

10:37.629 --> 10:39.650
I don't really, like, understand.

10:39.670 --> 10:45.492
We're absolutely blown away.

10:45.592 --> 10:49.934
It's actually kind of dizzying for me.

10:59.071 --> 11:00.453
Arigatou gozaimasu!

11:00.493 --> 11:03.096
Thank you so much for all your support!

11:03.156 --> 11:11.166
And of course we're really thankful to our senpai's hard work building up hololive to make it the amazing place that it is today.

11:11.426 --> 11:14.309
Even though today is... Does it still count?

11:14.430 --> 11:17.794
It's our first day as brand new members of hololive English.

11:18.514 --> 11:26.378
We would really like to do the same, you know, to make hololive an even more amazing and even more warm place for our future kouhai, too.

11:26.638 --> 11:29.020
Isn't it a bit early to be thinking that?

11:29.040 --> 11:33.802
It's a little bit early, but... It's important, you know?

11:33.842 --> 11:44.567
It's important, so... It'd make us really happy if you continue to let everyone know about all of us at Alvin, and if you could continue to spread your love of hololive everywhere you go.

11:46.799 --> 11:50.384
Maybe even FUWAMOCO could be included in that too, huh?

11:52.020 --> 11:52.661
Is that okay?

11:53.601 --> 11:55.223
Thank you for all the good ones!

11:55.243 --> 11:56.103
You know what?

11:56.123 --> 12:01.508
I saw on Twitter some Ruffians already have a wishy-washy mark.

12:01.568 --> 12:02.909
Yeah, I saw it too!

12:03.029 --> 12:04.770
I saw it too!

12:04.890 --> 12:06.311
Thank you so much!

12:06.351 --> 12:06.792
Thank you!

12:06.812 --> 12:08.693
We're very happy puppies right now.

12:09.734 --> 12:14.197
Once Twitter starts to be nice to us again, we'll be able to look at more stuff.

12:14.718 --> 12:18.241
So it's been a bit difficult for us, but we want to see lots of stuff.

12:20.302 --> 12:20.883
I noticed

12:21.383 --> 12:26.766
I made a spelling, a silly typo, and actually a couple tweets.

12:27.346 --> 12:32.528
And I wanted to retweet it, but then I got embarrassed.

12:32.548 --> 12:35.170
I haven't really been able to look at the tweet.

12:35.530 --> 12:36.310
Did you notice it?

12:36.630 --> 12:37.851
You didn't notice, right?

12:39.612 --> 12:40.332
Please don't notice.

12:40.352 --> 12:41.593
Please don't notice, okay?

12:41.653 --> 12:49.296
You know, I even asked Fuwawa to copy what she was gonna post, but Moco-chan looked at it and she said it's okay.

12:49.376 --> 12:50.217
I was sleepy.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.126
You didn't notice, okay.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.447
I'll do better.

12:55.527 --> 12:58.589
But you know, deleting tweets, that's no good.

12:58.609 --> 13:01.551
You can't delete it.

13:01.651 --> 13:02.652
Even if you have a typo.

13:02.672 --> 13:03.052
To us, what?

13:03.072 --> 13:05.594
We're gonna make another big mistake and then delete our tweets today.

13:06.215 --> 13:06.955
Just because we said it.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.764
Twitter, be nice to us.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.325
My fingers... Which typo?

13:21.365 --> 13:22.606
No, don't look, okay?

13:22.646 --> 13:24.427
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

13:24.447 --> 13:30.651
Now they're gonna be watching our tweets and be like... We just... No more typos, okay, Mococo-chan?

13:30.671 --> 13:31.432
We did it to ourselves.

13:32.272 --> 13:38.096
Well, the next thing... You might have noticed we had a bit of a surprise for you.

13:38.976 --> 13:39.216
De-den!

13:39.897 --> 13:41.118
Kaibutsu!

13:41.538 --> 13:42.038
Did you hear?

13:45.020 --> 13:45.742
Did you watch it?

13:45.802 --> 13:47.105
Our first cover song.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.568
You didn't miss it, right?

13:49.831 --> 13:51.615
It was released at the very end.

13:51.675 --> 13:53.239
We kind of forgot!

13:55.316 --> 13:55.676
Yeah.

13:55.896 --> 13:57.317
Kaibutsu by Yoasobi-san.

13:57.538 --> 14:00.120
Yeah, we covered Kaibutsu by Yoasobi-san.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.220
Moco-chan just said that.

14:01.481 --> 14:05.944
But, it's... It's... Really happy.

14:06.124 --> 14:06.804
What did you think of it?

14:06.824 --> 14:07.785
It's really good!

14:07.805 --> 14:08.966
You like it?

14:08.986 --> 14:09.947
Thank you!

14:09.987 --> 14:10.527
Thank you!

14:10.567 --> 14:12.108
Cover is fire!

14:12.128 --> 14:12.449
Thank you!

14:12.509 --> 14:12.869
It's...

14:20.354 --> 14:25.857
It made us really happy because, you know, it's our first cover song with FUWAMOCO.

14:26.558 --> 14:31.240
And, you know, we actually, we don't really have that much experience recording.

14:31.320 --> 14:31.720
No.

14:31.841 --> 14:33.061
We just like to howl.

14:33.101 --> 14:33.982
We just howl.

14:34.002 --> 14:35.282
And that's it.

14:35.743 --> 14:36.003
Yeah.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.844
You don't record the howling, you just howl, right?

14:38.904 --> 14:40.465
You just howl and then you're done.

14:41.126 --> 14:48.389
So, it's really special to us to have a recording that not only we can listen, but you can listen to too.

14:48.509 --> 14:50.190
And, you know, Kaibutsu.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.112
We chose it for a very special reason.

14:53.312 --> 14:55.033
Moco-chan, do you want to talk about it more?

14:55.133 --> 15:00.116
Well, I feel like recently I've had lots of just like, lightning.

15:00.276 --> 15:00.836
Hirameki.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.757
Hirameki, like, it just strikes me.

15:04.858 --> 15:06.060
That's what kaibutsu was.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.663
It was like, yoshi yaro!

15:07.803 --> 15:08.505
I'm gonna do it!

15:08.645 --> 15:10.127
Kaibutsu!

15:10.949 --> 15:12.271
At first I was like...

15:14.437 --> 15:20.799
But after reading the lyrics, it really really really resonated with us, you know?

15:21.319 --> 15:25.101
The meaning of the lyrics for songs is always really important to us.

15:25.121 --> 15:27.421
So we'd like you to check them out if you can.

15:27.901 --> 15:33.563
The reason why we covered Kaibutsu this time was because the lyrics really resonated with our hearts.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.764
That's right.

15:34.784 --> 15:35.324
That's the reason.

15:42.026 --> 15:42.546
Yarimashita.

15:42.707 --> 15:47.310
Utawasete itadakimashita.

15:47.390 --> 15:49.571
Atarashii challenge deshita.

15:49.631 --> 15:53.334
It was a new challenge according to- Yeah, there's so many harmonies.

15:53.454 --> 15:53.874
Right?

15:54.035 --> 15:58.298
Usually when we howl together it's just like, BAU BAU!

15:58.398 --> 16:00.819
And maybe like a little bit, BAU BAU!

16:00.899 --> 16:02.380
Moco-chan you'll do the BAU BAU.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.262
Right?

16:04.562 --> 16:05.262
That's accurate.

16:05.342 --> 16:05.643
Right?

16:06.043 --> 16:08.104
We're a bit nervous, but...

16:09.085 --> 16:15.589
Hamahiro-san did such a good job with the mix magic.

16:15.990 --> 16:18.891
And Hae-san with the illustration.

16:19.011 --> 16:22.113
Ohmika-san, beautiful video!

16:22.354 --> 16:23.334
You checked it out, right?

16:23.354 --> 16:26.056
Did you notice all the little things?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.097
All the cool things?

16:27.932 --> 16:28.513
Go find them.

16:29.715 --> 16:35.163
If you watched it once, maybe it's time to go watch it twice after FUWAMOCO Morning.

16:35.303 --> 16:35.584
Right?

16:36.105 --> 16:39.370
But it was a really, really fun experience.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.313
We're looking forward to hopefully doing more.

16:41.793 --> 16:41.994
Yeah.

16:43.696 --> 16:56.825
We know we talked about the lyrics being really important to us, but maybe if you don't understand Japanese, it might be difficult to understand the meaning, and that's why we did an English translation ourselves!

16:56.885 --> 16:57.585
FUWAMOCO!

16:57.645 --> 16:59.386
FUWAMOCO did the English translation.

16:59.406 --> 17:00.847
It's not quite ready yet, though.

17:00.967 --> 17:01.768
Not quite yet.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.370
So we're hoping that it'll be up soon, but we'll let you know, okay?

17:04.570 --> 17:06.111
Please look forward to it!

17:06.171 --> 17:08.813
But still watch it now, and then you can watch it once they're done, okay?

17:08.913 --> 17:10.694
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:10.854 --> 17:12.195
You can turn off all the lights,

17:12.855 --> 17:15.316
Make it fullscreen and watch it like you're in a movie theater.

17:15.336 --> 17:17.036
Really loud, right?

17:17.476 --> 17:19.036
Make the neighbors angry.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.057
That's the recommendation.

17:21.177 --> 17:22.857
Please watch it, okay?

17:24.897 --> 17:33.619
As for one thing... I thought maybe we should address... It's still our first day, but... This.

17:35.059 --> 17:37.059
There's a misunderstanding!

17:37.119 --> 17:38.020
BAU BAU BAU!

17:38.040 --> 17:38.160
This.

17:42.871 --> 17:44.132
I was framed!

17:44.152 --> 17:47.654
I was framed.

17:47.674 --> 17:48.714
During the collab.

18:05.391 --> 18:11.436
Both Calli-senpai and A-chan thought that Fuwawa said something that was wrong.

18:11.496 --> 18:11.556
No!

18:11.937 --> 18:13.898
I didn't say anything bad!

18:14.319 --> 18:18.162
I'm not the first avid member to say a bad word!

18:18.182 --> 18:19.843
No, no, no, no.

18:23.315 --> 18:27.479
Ruffians, you're not thinking that I really said that, right?

18:27.859 --> 18:30.121
You know I'm not that kind of person, right?

18:30.622 --> 18:31.963
We are.

18:32.323 --> 18:34.385
Us and Biboo are not that type of person.

18:34.546 --> 18:40.692
I don't know about Nurse and Shiori, but... Not us and Biboo.

18:40.992 --> 18:44.936
You know, it happened when I was explaining, you know, how...

18:45.476 --> 18:47.838
We got into the cell and everything.

18:48.498 --> 18:51.140
And I said, we got locked up!

18:52.301 --> 18:55.083
But they thought it was fluffed up.

18:55.123 --> 18:59.546
Moco-chan, you're gonna say it straight like that?

19:00.346 --> 19:01.687
But a bit different than that.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.288
A bit different than that!

19:04.329 --> 19:12.714
I think A-chan and Calli-senpai, maybe they need to get their ears adjusted.

19:12.754 --> 19:14.516
Their minds out of the clutter.

19:15.756 --> 19:16.817
Ruffians, you too!

19:17.177 --> 19:18.398
You too if you thought that.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.020
You have to believe us, okay?

19:21.520 --> 19:22.761
I believe them, thank you.

19:22.781 --> 19:23.441
Thank you.

19:24.142 --> 19:26.864
Thank you for believing.

19:26.884 --> 19:27.784
You understand that?

19:28.184 --> 19:31.327
I am not the first member of A.V.I.N.

19:31.607 --> 19:32.347
to say anything.

19:32.407 --> 19:38.071
And I will never be the last member to say anything.

19:38.391 --> 19:41.433
I will never be a member that says something bad like that.

19:42.154 --> 19:42.734
Got it?

19:42.894 --> 19:43.274
Understood?

19:43.354 --> 19:43.975
I'm not too sure.

19:48.588 --> 19:56.190
Now that we all understand that... We wanted to talk about the debut goods!

19:56.770 --> 19:57.871
The debut goods!

19:57.931 --> 19:58.911
Have you checked them out?

19:59.211 --> 20:06.213
Of course FUWAMOCO would want to talk about the debut goods, right?

20:06.633 --> 20:09.114
Somebody probably told them.

20:09.774 --> 20:10.374
Not that.

20:10.394 --> 20:12.815
We're really excited.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.816
Do you understand how amazing this is?

20:15.981 --> 20:16.882
Do you understand?

20:18.523 --> 20:22.286
You already bought them!

20:22.306 --> 20:24.088
Thank you!

20:24.448 --> 20:32.155
Well, the reason why we wanted to talk about them is... You know, FUWAMOCO, this is really big.

20:32.195 --> 20:33.316
This is really exciting!

20:33.336 --> 20:38.380
I think for a lot of people, they sort of think that goods are given and it's just gonna happen, right?

20:38.780 --> 20:39.561
But it's not!

20:39.741 --> 20:40.462
No, it's not!

20:41.894 --> 20:42.855
We're really, really excited.

20:42.915 --> 20:43.876
We hope you are too.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.578
We hope you check them out, you know.

20:45.858 --> 20:49.823
There's the acrylic stands, the acrylic panels.

20:49.883 --> 20:51.725
There's acrylic laminates.

20:52.045 --> 20:53.467
I am really excited about those.

20:53.567 --> 20:54.608
There's the stained glass.

20:55.129 --> 20:55.950
The strap!

20:56.010 --> 20:57.732
The stained glass strap!

20:57.972 --> 20:59.714
And of course the voices.

20:59.934 --> 21:00.795
The voice too.

21:00.855 --> 21:02.457
Yes, the pre-escape voices.

21:02.877 --> 21:05.478
Really, really fun to be able to record it.

21:05.678 --> 21:06.798
Ah, I forgot my Japanese.

21:06.818 --> 21:09.518
Did you guys check out our Advent merch?

21:09.538 --> 21:10.959
Our debut merch is on sale!

21:10.999 --> 21:11.339
It's on sale!

21:11.359 --> 21:12.739
I can't stop getting excited.

21:12.759 --> 21:17.940
The reason I wanted to talk about our merch today is because I think it's really important to us.

21:30.953 --> 21:31.173
Wow!

21:31.474 --> 21:32.175
Wow deshioi!

21:46.571 --> 21:51.093
Please check it out.

21:51.373 --> 21:54.255
Yeah, we didn't know.

21:55.255 --> 21:59.817
We haven't decided how many goods, how many merch sets we're supposed to buy.

21:59.837 --> 22:01.918
Yeah, because you're supposed to buy three.

22:02.038 --> 22:02.178
Three!

22:02.218 --> 22:03.739
That's the otaku rule, right?

22:03.879 --> 22:05.440
I can't remember, I just remember three.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.221
One to, like, love?

22:08.961 --> 22:09.822
One for saving.

22:09.842 --> 22:14.026
And what was the other one?

22:14.146 --> 22:16.528
To love again when the other one gets loved up?

22:16.988 --> 22:20.231
Maybe.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.473
But it's okay, you can buy more than three too.

22:22.854 --> 22:24.555
An army.

22:24.955 --> 22:26.477
An army of FUWAMOCO!

22:26.497 --> 22:27.638
That is fun though.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.111
I do have a little army too.

22:31.312 --> 22:36.276
It's good to have collections that make you happy, you know?

22:36.416 --> 22:39.018
Being surrounded by the ones you love most.

22:43.063 --> 22:45.064
I hope you check it out, especially the pre-escape voice.

22:45.804 --> 22:49.885
That was really... I wasn't sure if I was doing things right.

22:49.905 --> 22:51.945
It was fun, but it was a bit scary.

22:52.085 --> 22:52.386
Yeah.

22:53.626 --> 22:57.587
We're not gonna spoil anything, so you'll have to give it a listen.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.528
But let us know what you thought of it, okay?

23:01.068 --> 23:05.829
I'm sure your heart will be beating just as fast as ours were, so... You got it!

23:06.349 --> 23:07.190
Thank you!

23:07.210 --> 23:07.770
Please listen!

23:09.750 --> 23:13.331
Thank you!

23:14.111 --> 23:25.254
Well, we also, it wasn't just the pre-escape voice that we recorded, but we also did the starting voice!

23:25.694 --> 23:36.617
You might have seen them because all the other hololive members have been releasing them, but it's kind of nice because with the start of Advent, it's also the start of our starting voices.

23:37.910 --> 23:42.934
We all, all of the other members recorded in both English and Japanese.

23:43.014 --> 23:45.015
Both of them.

23:45.556 --> 23:51.260
And I know, for us, like... Not June.

23:51.620 --> 23:51.820
July.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.581
It's June.

23:52.841 --> 23:54.782
It's June, June, June, July!

23:54.822 --> 23:55.863
July, July!

23:55.983 --> 23:56.904
It's July.

23:57.965 --> 24:03.409
But you know, for Shiori, and for Bijou, and for Nerissa, it wasn't...

24:05.530 --> 24:06.630
It wasn't a walk in the park.

24:06.650 --> 24:09.911
No, it wasn't a walk in the park for them to record it in Japanese.

24:09.951 --> 24:12.672
So, you know, we all helped out each other.

24:13.092 --> 24:16.153
And we had a little bit of a listen.

24:17.033 --> 24:19.454
And it's really, really cute.

24:20.374 --> 24:22.674
We recommend it a lot.

24:23.575 --> 24:25.515
Please check them out as well, okay?

24:26.095 --> 24:28.116
There's a lot of different variations.

24:28.156 --> 24:30.916
Cute morning voices, sleepy voices, grumpy voices.

24:31.156 --> 24:32.857
Especially Moco-chan's grumpy voice.

24:34.349 --> 24:41.552
But you never know what it's going to quite be like, so... I can't wait to listen.

24:41.652 --> 24:42.652
Maybe like a week or so.

24:42.672 --> 24:44.773
Please listen to the starting voice.

24:44.853 --> 24:47.254
It's both in English and Japanese.

24:47.314 --> 24:49.715
All the Advent members did it, so please check it out.

24:49.775 --> 24:53.056
This is very important information for FUWAMOCO Morning.

25:03.373 --> 25:08.776
We wanted to let you know that starting next time, there will be a new corner for FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:08.796 --> 25:12.878
We'd like to introduce two new segments called Doggie of the Day.

25:13.338 --> 25:14.338
We'll start with the first one.

25:14.358 --> 25:18.460
The next FUWAMOCO Morning will have a new corner.

25:18.961 --> 25:21.522
The first one is called Doggie of the Day.

25:26.144 --> 25:34.047
There's a corner called Doggie of the Day, and we're hoping that you'll send us your best Puppers for us to introduce and brighten everyone's day.

25:34.607 --> 25:37.088
We've already seen some very bestest friends.

25:37.268 --> 25:38.189
They're so cute.

25:38.309 --> 25:43.591
They've been being sent in to help FUWAMOCO, and it's been very, very helpful.

25:43.631 --> 25:51.234
We're very happy to see it, but we'd also like to nominate them with the FUWAMOCO Morning, the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.375
Hashtag.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.897
Oh, you know, we can introduce them.

25:56.037 --> 25:57.118
On that topic.

25:57.618 --> 25:58.219
You tweeted.

25:58.239 --> 26:01.201
Hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

26:02.543 --> 26:04.004
Maybe they have you.

26:04.164 --> 26:04.705
Ruffians.

26:06.026 --> 26:06.506
Have you.

26:06.526 --> 26:10.169
It's okay if you don't know what to tweet, you know.

26:10.530 --> 26:12.711
There's always BAU BAU.

26:14.493 --> 26:14.653
So...

26:16.462 --> 26:16.902
Go and tweet.

26:17.162 --> 26:17.642
BAU BAU!

26:17.862 --> 26:19.363
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

26:19.563 --> 26:20.443
Or a good popper.

26:20.743 --> 26:21.443
Oh, good popper.

26:21.503 --> 26:22.403
Yeah, you know.

26:23.544 --> 26:28.705
But yes, we'll be waiting to see your furry and fuzzy dog friends.

26:28.945 --> 26:29.505
And fluffy.

26:30.325 --> 26:31.105
Furry and fluffy.

26:31.365 --> 26:32.686
Yeah.

26:32.746 --> 26:36.407
Ah, I forgot about fluffy.

26:36.447 --> 26:40.327
But not just that, we also have the Today I Went for a Walk set.

26:40.448 --> 26:41.108
Yeah!

26:41.328 --> 26:41.848
Now, um...

26:43.371 --> 26:44.552
It's not just today's doggy segment.

26:44.572 --> 26:45.993
It's like today's walk.

26:46.013 --> 26:47.054
It's not today's walk.

26:47.074 --> 26:48.355
Today we went for a walk.

26:48.435 --> 26:49.336
Ah, we're doing it right.

26:49.376 --> 26:50.277
We're doing it right.

26:50.317 --> 26:55.121
Yeah, there's a segment like that.

26:55.501 --> 26:57.342
Yes, so for today I went for a walk.

26:57.823 --> 27:00.905
We'd like to ask you to maybe submit a picture.

27:01.005 --> 27:01.506
If you want.

27:01.686 --> 27:02.326
Yeah, if you want.

27:02.407 --> 27:08.271
And a small report when you go out for a walk using the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

27:08.512 --> 27:09.532
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

27:11.977 --> 27:14.538
You know how much we like to go for walks, right?

27:14.558 --> 27:15.278
Walks are so good.

27:15.598 --> 27:22.080
So we thought that it would make us really happy if we could hear about all the wonderful little adventures that you'd be going on.

27:22.341 --> 27:22.481
Yeah.

27:22.501 --> 27:27.142
Usually we like to take little photos and stuff like that to remember like, oh this happened today and stuff.

27:27.562 --> 27:27.922
Right!

27:27.962 --> 27:30.403
So we thought that it would make you happy too if you did that.

27:30.483 --> 27:33.784
You know, like, today's flowers are really pretty!

27:33.824 --> 27:34.185
Right!

27:34.325 --> 27:36.805
Or you saw something like, haha that's silly!

27:36.825 --> 27:38.106
Those kind of things.

27:39.056 --> 27:40.817
But only if you're comfortable.

27:40.837 --> 27:40.917
Yeah.

27:40.937 --> 27:43.680
Yeah, you could, like, share a photo.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.601
Yeah, flowers, nature.

27:45.741 --> 27:46.462
Those kind of things.

27:46.522 --> 27:47.903
Anything that made you smile.

27:48.043 --> 27:48.123
Yeah.

27:48.163 --> 27:50.745
If it made you smile, then it'll definitely make us smile.

27:50.785 --> 27:51.085
Right!

27:51.566 --> 27:55.629
So please make sure you add the hashtag FUWAMOCOMORNING to your tweet.

27:55.789 --> 28:01.353
And if you could include a sentence or two just about how your walk was, maybe how it made you feel.

28:01.373 --> 28:02.674
Even if it's like a rainy day.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.838
Yeah, you know, just what made today's walk extra special.

28:06.958 --> 28:07.178
Right.

28:07.218 --> 28:07.358
Yeah.

28:08.916 --> 28:15.478
We'll be looking forward to your stories of getting outside, stretching the puppies, getting some fresh air.

28:15.538 --> 28:16.598
Those kind of things.

28:16.658 --> 28:19.459
Can you do that?

28:19.639 --> 28:21.199
We'll be waiting, okay?

28:21.919 --> 28:23.560
We'll be waiting, so make sure you do it.

28:23.960 --> 28:24.700
De-den.

28:25.320 --> 28:25.600
Den.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.168
We also need more help.

28:35.188 --> 28:36.029
We need more help.

28:36.690 --> 28:39.355
We're a little bit needy sometimes.

28:40.877 --> 28:42.179
Hopefully that's okay, but...

28:42.981 --> 28:43.181
Yes!

28:44.241 --> 28:45.702
On tomorrow!

28:46.242 --> 28:47.282
On tomorrow!

28:47.502 --> 28:51.023
On tomorrow at 6pm PT, 9pm ET, 1am GMT, and 10am JST.

28:51.323 --> 28:53.463
We have our first Q&A stream!

28:53.503 --> 28:55.283
We're gonna be doing it!

28:55.323 --> 28:56.044
Tomorrow!

28:56.084 --> 28:56.764
Yes, tomorrow!

29:08.306 --> 29:13.607
So we'd like you to ask, we've seen a lot of questions, a lot of really good questions so far.

29:13.687 --> 29:16.668
But I'm sure you probably have still lots of questions.

29:16.748 --> 29:21.709
So if you have any, please send them to us with the hashtag, helpfuwamoco.

29:22.169 --> 29:24.970
And we'll pick out as many as we can, okay?

29:25.050 --> 29:26.090
It's right there on the screen.

29:26.990 --> 29:29.571
Yeah, tomorrow, tomorrow!

29:29.791 --> 29:30.591
Is it that shocking?

29:31.551 --> 29:33.772
Well, you can think of a question before tomorrow, right?

29:33.792 --> 29:36.714
Yeah, there's a lot, a lot of questions I think you could think of.

29:36.734 --> 29:41.456
You know, like, what's it like being twin demon dog sisters?

29:42.697 --> 29:45.618
What's life like together?

29:45.658 --> 29:46.659
What's Pero like?

29:46.699 --> 29:48.379
You know, those kind of things, right?

29:48.860 --> 29:52.601
So, we're gonna be looking forward to your questions, okay?

29:52.621 --> 29:55.603
But is tomorrow a thing?

29:57.164 --> 29:57.704
I don't get it.

30:01.005 --> 30:05.148
I'm happy, you're happy about it.

30:05.689 --> 30:06.850
I see lots of good questions.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.752
There's a lot of good questions.

30:09.772 --> 30:11.934
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, helpfuwamoco.

30:11.954 --> 30:13.455
That's cute in Japanese.

30:13.475 --> 30:14.075
Helpfuwamoco.

30:14.355 --> 30:15.716
Helpfuwamoco, yeah!

30:15.756 --> 30:16.077
Help me!

30:25.538 --> 30:27.539
We need a lot of help.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.281
But maybe it's a bit more fun now, right?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.943
But that's not all!

30:34.604 --> 30:39.146
After FUWAMOCO Morning today, later in the evening we have VLOG!

30:39.346 --> 30:40.847
Tonight!

30:40.907 --> 30:42.068
Even better than tomorrow.

30:42.288 --> 30:45.450
Tonight at 6PM PT, 9PM ET, 1AM GMT, and 10AM JST.

30:50.751 --> 31:01.573
We'll be playing our first game, Fogs.

31:01.873 --> 31:04.974
We've become a cutie hot dog fog.

31:06.854 --> 31:11.955
We've never played it before, but it looks very cute and colorful, and we make cute noises.

31:11.975 --> 31:12.815
Yeah, it's tonight!

31:13.015 --> 31:13.655
Even closer.

31:19.758 --> 31:21.319
We're really looking forward to it.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.883
I feel like it's been such a long time since I played a game together with you, Moco-chan.

31:26.383 --> 31:27.704
It'll be very relaxing.

31:27.904 --> 31:28.204
I think.

31:28.685 --> 31:28.925
Really?

31:29.025 --> 31:29.365
I think.

31:29.746 --> 31:31.687
We're not gonna, like, fight or argue?

31:32.268 --> 31:32.988
I wanna go this way!

31:33.028 --> 31:33.829
I wanna go that way!

31:34.289 --> 31:37.271
If we wanna go one way later, we can just do that later.

31:37.291 --> 31:37.492
Yeah.

31:38.957 --> 31:39.798
It's not that hard.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.140
You'll have to come and check it out to see how things go, okay?

31:43.621 --> 31:43.761
Yeah.

31:44.041 --> 31:47.904
I think this is maybe the only cute game on our schedule this week.

31:48.485 --> 31:48.645
Yeah.

31:48.785 --> 31:51.047
All of them are sort of scary or tough.

31:51.107 --> 31:56.030
Yeah, but... It'll be okay because you'll be there with us, right, Ruffians?

31:56.491 --> 31:56.891
Right!

31:57.772 --> 31:58.632
You'll join us, right?

31:59.313 --> 31:59.473
Right?

32:00.234 --> 32:00.594
Right!

32:03.756 --> 32:05.618
Well... Before...

32:07.483 --> 32:12.005
Before we get going, we'd like to share our schedule and just have another little peek.

32:12.525 --> 32:13.225
One last time.

32:13.245 --> 32:18.367
It's a bit tiny, but if you'd like to see it a bit bigger, you can check out our Twitter as well.

32:19.067 --> 32:29.891
We have some very exciting things coming up and we'd really like you to make sure that you come and walk out at our FUWAMOCO Walk and War Party!

32:30.232 --> 32:31.412
On Saturday?

32:31.492 --> 32:31.832
Saturday?

32:32.472 --> 32:32.733
Yeah.

32:34.433 --> 32:37.074
On Sunday, we'll be doing our first ever karaoke stream.

32:37.134 --> 32:39.896
We'll be singing a song called Walkin' for a Party.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.377
It's kind of like Rock n' Rawr.

32:41.397 --> 32:42.717
It's got an interesting name.

32:55.185 --> 32:56.606
We're really excited.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.206
There's a lot of good music, a lot of songs.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.066
Good songs are good!

32:59.086 --> 33:00.067
Especially anime songs too.

33:00.127 --> 33:01.047
We hope you'll be there!

33:01.067 --> 33:02.348
We also have a very, very mysterious

33:19.923 --> 33:22.184
Twice stream on Sunday.

33:22.564 --> 33:24.624
So it's a question, question, question.

33:24.804 --> 33:25.484
What could it be?

33:25.504 --> 33:26.185
What could it be?

33:26.405 --> 33:26.905
We don't know.

33:26.945 --> 33:27.905
Question, question, question.

33:27.985 --> 33:29.905
And also we have Advent Club playing.

33:30.166 --> 33:30.326
Yes!

33:30.386 --> 33:30.946
Left 4 Dead 2.

33:31.006 --> 33:32.446
Left 4 Dead 2.

33:32.626 --> 33:34.106
We need your strength, so please.

33:34.427 --> 33:35.487
Please.

33:35.527 --> 33:36.267
Please, please.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.708
But I'm really looking forward to it though.

33:39.768 --> 33:48.170
Because even though it's kind of scary, you know, Shiori and Bijou and Ursa will be there, so it'll be okay, right?

33:49.545 --> 33:50.725
Right.

33:51.726 --> 34:03.629
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd actually like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

34:03.849 --> 34:04.489
Is that okay?

34:07.770 --> 34:08.311
Okay!

34:08.951 --> 34:10.591
Say BAU BAU now!

34:10.691 --> 34:11.231
BAU BAU!

34:11.251 --> 34:11.311
RUN!

34:12.252 --> 34:12.812
BAU BAU!

34:17.922 --> 34:18.222
Alex!

34:18.662 --> 34:20.243
BAU BAU!

34:20.343 --> 34:21.823
It's so fast I can't read it!

34:22.223 --> 34:22.963
Nisha!

34:23.363 --> 34:24.524
BAU BAU!

34:24.544 --> 34:25.444
Ryo-san!

34:25.604 --> 34:26.784
BAU BAU!

34:26.944 --> 34:27.545
Claw!

34:27.765 --> 34:30.145
BAU BAU!

34:30.185 --> 34:31.105
Mine!

34:31.125 --> 34:31.265
BAU BAU!

34:31.546 --> 34:36.787
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

34:37.147 --> 34:40.108
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:40.328 --> 34:42.148
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

34:42.168 --> 34:42.988
BAU BAU!
