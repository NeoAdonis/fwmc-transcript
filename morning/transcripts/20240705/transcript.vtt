05:06.000 --> 05:08.854
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:09.000 --> 05:13.500
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.500 --> 05:19.000
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo! BAU BAU!

05:19.227 --> 05:22.529
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.869 --> 05:26.331
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:26.711 --> 05:29.593
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.753 --> 05:31.554
BAU BAU!

05:31.574 --> 05:36.297
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:36.317 --> 05:38.518
BAU BAU!

05:39.018 --> 05:41.379
Good morning, Ruffians!

05:41.459 --> 05:44.601
We're at our 105th episode!

05:44.721 --> 05:46.682
I'm 105th episode!

05:46.762 --> 05:49.103
BAU BAU!

05:49.203 --> 05:49.923
I'm 100 and what?

05:49.943 --> 05:51.764
105th episode!

05:51.804 --> 05:52.164
Yes!

05:52.624 --> 05:59.047
BAU BAU!

05:59.107 --> 06:02.969
Before we go, Ruffians, we're already at the end of the week.

06:03.449 --> 06:04.110
Right!

06:04.410 --> 06:06.251
Where did this week go?

06:07.825 --> 06:08.826
I think I know where it went.

06:08.906 --> 06:10.066
I think I know too.

06:10.086 --> 06:15.950
I saw a bunch of maybe new viewers!

06:15.970 --> 06:20.093
Maybe this is your first time watching FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:20.213 --> 06:33.381
Well, to explain for some of those that are joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:33.501 --> 06:34.842
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:34.862 --> 06:36.483
And it's hosted by us!

06:37.103 --> 06:38.384
FUWAMOCO!

06:38.404 --> 06:44.406
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:45.126 --> 06:50.428
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:50.828 --> 06:54.669
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:54.689 --> 06:55.370
BAU BAU!

07:00.192 --> 07:04.435
And a brand new weekend just about to start!

07:04.555 --> 07:06.636
A weekend full of FUWAMOCO-fans!

07:07.317 --> 07:08.797
A first summer time weekend!

07:10.979 --> 07:16.362
Summer is officially starting!

07:16.762 --> 07:22.806
Well, only happy things, exciting things, good things happen in summer, right Moco-chan?

07:23.046 --> 07:24.447
That's what you probably wish!

07:25.686 --> 07:28.869
Let's see the Pero Sighting show.

07:51.697 --> 07:52.318
De-den!

07:54.039 --> 07:57.702
What is... Is this like a cryptic video?

08:00.964 --> 08:02.065
I don't really like this.

08:05.167 --> 08:05.708
What happened?

08:05.728 --> 08:08.570
This is the video that was found by those Ruffians.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.713
Ruffians!

08:12.253 --> 08:15.455
Do you not realize how dangerous these warehouses are?

08:16.498 --> 08:17.159
Yeah.

08:18.019 --> 08:21.862
Ruffians' peril's always lurking in places like these, you know.

08:22.282 --> 08:27.485
Warehouses, construction sites, bars.

08:27.665 --> 08:28.846
You have to be careful.

08:29.186 --> 08:31.668
Look at all the peril sightings we get from their hunt.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.749
We always get them from here.

08:33.949 --> 08:35.190
You're in his territory.

08:35.230 --> 08:36.491
You have to look out.

08:37.772 --> 08:39.253
He's trying to capture a meal.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.357
Warehouse is a perfect place for that.

08:43.697 --> 08:56.346
Ruffians, you know, if you're going to enter any warehouse or construction sites, you gotta make sure that you bring your pudding with you just in case, okay?

08:56.726 --> 08:59.608
Are you sure not the... the... what's it?

08:59.768 --> 09:00.728
Safety wearer.

09:01.629 --> 09:06.252
Safety wearer is good too, but nothing stops Pero like a pudding does.

09:06.912 --> 09:07.833
Safety wearer.

09:08.313 --> 09:09.414
Don't forget it, okay?

09:10.074 --> 09:10.615
And pudding.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.287
Okay, safety wear and pleading!

09:15.688 --> 09:19.251
BAU BAU!

09:19.792 --> 09:21.013
Most effective that way.

09:21.053 --> 09:26.777
Most effective, you know.

09:26.918 --> 09:30.701
Ruffians, summertime only starts with happy things.

09:31.541 --> 09:34.664
Except for maybe FUWAMOCO.

09:34.684 --> 09:37.246
Right, Moco-chan?

09:37.526 --> 09:37.927
Yeah.

09:39.210 --> 09:46.692
Ruffians, um, did you notice that maybe earlier this week we were a little bit quiet?

09:46.712 --> 09:49.032
You know?

09:49.092 --> 09:49.512
Yeah.

09:50.732 --> 09:56.114
Well, that's because we were down for three days because we got food poisoning.

09:56.334 --> 09:56.734
Yeah.

09:57.134 --> 09:58.554
BAU BAU.

09:58.994 --> 10:01.495
It's the first time that we've been seriously ill.

10:01.815 --> 10:05.035
You know, other than my barker and migraines every now and then.

10:05.476 --> 10:06.836
You know, since we debuted.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.136
Yeah.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.064
Couldn't come at a worse time.

10:10.084 --> 10:11.884
Yeah.

10:11.964 --> 10:15.626
Yeah, Fuwawa had it the roughest too.

10:16.126 --> 10:33.614
You know, we had some time before dance practice so you know we thought that we'd go to a nice reputable restaurant that we really wanted to visit ever since we got to Japan but we just couldn't because we're really busy and... and Ruffians.

10:35.222 --> 10:37.484
If you're in Japan, you're gonna go to a restaurant.

10:37.524 --> 10:39.586
What are you gonna have to eat?

10:40.227 --> 10:40.687
Yeah.

10:41.468 --> 10:42.229
It was that.

10:44.431 --> 10:44.992
Yeah.

10:46.173 --> 10:46.733
Yeah.

10:47.374 --> 10:52.099
So, uh, we're both really, really out of it for a while.

10:52.559 --> 10:52.859
Yeah.

10:55.203 --> 10:58.525
It took me until yesterday, yesterday night!

10:58.565 --> 11:00.066
A couple hours ago.

11:00.206 --> 11:01.587
Ah, yesterday night, but- No!

11:01.667 --> 11:03.128
I'm, I'm eating.

11:03.828 --> 11:05.129
I'm eating again!

11:05.189 --> 11:05.929
A bit again.

11:05.949 --> 11:09.792
Yummy peach.

11:09.932 --> 11:19.017
But, you know, now, it was really rough, but now, we're back feeling our souls are fluffy and fuzzy souls again, all for you!

11:19.057 --> 11:19.417
Yeah!

11:19.797 --> 11:20.558
And that's great!

11:20.578 --> 11:21.558
You know why?

11:22.659 --> 11:27.101
Cuz we have so much to do now!

11:27.641 --> 11:32.824
You know, it was supposed to be FUWAMOCO Ganbare Week, right?

11:32.844 --> 11:33.624
You know?

11:33.644 --> 11:39.126
And it was FUWAMOCO Ganbare Week because we had a bunch of homework that we had to do.

11:39.146 --> 11:45.829
We'd be juggling with everything else, but now it's gotten even crazier.

11:46.750 --> 11:47.270
Yeah.

11:48.382 --> 11:56.551
You know, we just wanted to spend time with you and get lots of homework done this week, but now... Things are worse.

11:59.161 --> 12:02.882
Please, Ruffians, please continue to cheer for us!

12:04.042 --> 12:15.045
And also, a big, big thank you to Mane-chan for rescheduling everything for us and trying to pick up all the pieces of everything that the sushi destroyed.

12:15.385 --> 12:17.866
It's like a puzzle exploded.

12:17.886 --> 12:17.966
Yeah.

12:18.966 --> 12:23.647
And then you have to rearrange it into a new proper piece.

12:24.147 --> 12:25.867
Yeah.

12:26.047 --> 12:26.788
It's like that.

12:27.508 --> 12:27.708
Yeah.

12:29.257 --> 12:30.298
Thank you!

12:30.398 --> 12:32.420
Thank you, Mane-chan!

12:32.880 --> 12:34.682
We're gonna do our best!

12:35.102 --> 12:40.247
I think you know, the rest of FUWAMOCO Ganbare Week is gonna be a fun one, right?

12:40.347 --> 12:43.109
BAU BAU!

12:44.070 --> 12:55.240
You know, speaking of fun things that happen... Yesterday, at Day 1 of Anime Expo FUWAMOCO, we had a

12:55.540 --> 12:59.943
Daishou Mini Rock n' Roar Party at the hololive booth!

13:00.283 --> 13:06.968
And we sung a bunch of songs together with so many Ruffians!

13:07.088 --> 13:07.868
Did you sing?

13:08.069 --> 13:09.069
Oh my goodness!

13:09.109 --> 13:10.730
So many Ruffians!

13:20.037 --> 13:24.538
Ah, FUWAMOCO, you know, we wanted to sing a bunch of songs!

13:24.978 --> 13:30.619
Ah, but we made sure to sing some classics, as well as fan-favorite like Crazy Frog!

13:30.879 --> 13:32.980
Ah, we really had so much fun!

13:33.000 --> 13:40.061
You know, it meant so much to us to be able to share that moment with you there and hear all your BAU BAUs!

13:40.601 --> 13:43.242
So many BAU BAUs, oh my, oh my goodness.

13:46.663 --> 13:48.945
You know, we actually heard Ruffians.

13:49.746 --> 13:56.912
There were some Ruffians that couldn't even hear us anymore because you were BAU BAUing so loudly!

13:57.632 --> 13:59.874
And that's exactly the spirit, Ruffians!

13:59.994 --> 14:02.997
There were so many Ruffians too.

14:05.225 --> 14:06.866
It got a bit silly as well.

14:06.886 --> 14:07.647
Yeah.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.449
Just a bit.

14:11.810 --> 14:20.956
Thank you, Ruffians, for trying to get to know each other very well and getting nice and close so that as many people as possible could watch.

14:22.077 --> 14:22.477
Yeah!

14:22.577 --> 14:25.439
It seems like it was pretty close to you.

14:25.519 --> 14:27.701
Even closer than we are right now, Moco-chan.

14:27.721 --> 14:27.801
Wow.

14:33.165 --> 14:40.250
You know, we really hope that we can do more Rock n' Rawr Parties like this all around the world one day.

14:40.270 --> 14:46.556
You know, maybe FUWAMOCO, we can have our own solo live.

14:46.576 --> 14:46.676
Maybe.

14:47.076 --> 14:47.857
Yeah!

14:48.157 --> 14:49.858
FUWAMOCO the concert!

14:50.319 --> 14:51.260
Not many Rock n' Rawr Parties.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.200
That doesn't sound great.

14:52.501 --> 14:53.922
FUWAMOCO the concert.

14:55.143 --> 14:55.743
I don't know.

14:55.863 --> 14:56.604
I don't know about that.

14:57.636 --> 14:58.237
I don't know.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.178
What do you think, Ruffians?

15:00.738 --> 15:02.219
FUWAMOCO the concert.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.302
FUWAMOCO the experience!

15:06.983 --> 15:09.604
What about song requests, Ruffians?

15:09.644 --> 15:13.087
That way you know we can get all prepared and advanced.

15:13.107 --> 15:15.808
Crazy frog.

15:16.409 --> 15:17.770
C-c-crazy frog.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.751
C-c-crazy frog.

15:19.771 --> 15:21.732
Crazy frog.

15:22.593 --> 15:23.514
Only crazy frog.

15:25.540 --> 15:25.720
No.

15:27.741 --> 15:29.122
No!

15:30.703 --> 15:31.904
No!

15:32.044 --> 15:35.166
But, uh... Ruffians!

15:36.667 --> 15:37.067
No!

15:37.087 --> 15:43.911
We actually have a secret!

15:44.451 --> 15:50.615
Well, you know, Ruffians... FUWAMOCO, we're always watching, right?

15:50.675 --> 15:51.916
Yeah!

15:51.936 --> 15:55.138
So, you know, sometimes we can get a good peek

15:55.783 --> 15:57.105
FUWAMOCO Morning!

16:01.380 --> 16:12.829
It was really nice being able to see Ruffians find all their friends.

16:12.849 --> 16:16.332
Maybe get some sun and hugs from reading.

16:16.352 --> 16:19.435
We are friendly together.

16:19.915 --> 16:22.938
Ruffians in a natural habitat.

16:23.578 --> 16:25.720
I thought the Ruffians could see us.

16:27.532 --> 16:28.392
Kazami!

16:28.412 --> 16:28.452
Hi!

16:29.353 --> 16:36.255
Thank you so much!

16:36.455 --> 16:40.156
It was so much fun at Anime Expo!

16:40.176 --> 16:49.119
And we hope you continue to have more fun because... Well, Anime Expo, you know, Day 1 just finished.

16:49.679 --> 16:54.481
But Day 2 and Day 3 and Day 4 are still upcoming!

16:54.501 --> 16:56.382
And I'm FUWAMOCO!

16:57.322 --> 17:02.847
Actually, we're special guests at Good Smile Company's panel!

17:02.867 --> 17:09.473
You know what, we're sure you've heard it already from us, but we're very excited about it!

17:09.573 --> 17:15.078
It's gonna be happening in the Peachy Hall on Saturday at 2PM.

17:15.238 --> 17:18.501
Please do not miss it, okay?

17:18.982 --> 17:22.505
But you know, we're so honored to be special guests

17:23.085 --> 17:34.379
And we'll be at the panel together with YAGOO-san himself and the founder of Good Smile Company, Takanori Aki!

17:34.399 --> 17:36.101
We're not nervous, right Moco-chan?

17:42.946 --> 17:44.968
Yeah, maybe just a bit nervous.

17:45.388 --> 17:51.273
But you know, we're gonna do our best to make sure that our love for figures comes out at least a bit.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.915
Hopefully in full force, but at least a bit.

17:56.897 --> 18:01.301
But, we're Ruffians attending Anime Expo in person!

18:01.862 --> 18:02.862
Peachy hole!

18:03.223 --> 18:07.226
It seems like it's Moc clearing seats in between panels this year!

18:08.627 --> 18:14.371
Please be advised that you might not get a seat even if you wait in line for the panel early on.

18:14.491 --> 18:18.094
I know it seems silly, but it's just like that, okay?

18:18.114 --> 18:27.081
So you know, if you really, really want to be there, then maybe the best method is to go and enjoy all the programming the room offers.

18:27.101 --> 18:30.863
You know, there's lots of good stuff starting straight from early in the morning.

18:30.923 --> 18:36.047
You know, if you really want to make sure that you have a chair so that you can be there to cheer us on.

18:36.227 --> 18:38.289
Yeah, cause we're gonna need your help.

18:39.970 --> 18:41.470
Not nervous!

18:41.490 --> 18:41.530
No!

18:42.111 --> 18:46.192
And also for Ruffians who maybe can't make it to LA.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.253
That's understandable.

18:47.433 --> 18:54.096
We've also heard that there will be an online livestream for the panel announced at a later date.

18:54.456 --> 18:59.918
So please stay tuned for more information about that and we'll share it with you as soon as we can!

19:00.058 --> 19:01.619
Okay!

19:01.679 --> 19:02.799
Yeah!

19:03.259 --> 19:03.440
Okay!

19:04.620 --> 19:08.982
So, uh, please give us lots of head pats and bow for us a bunch.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.802
Because we're gonna be very nervous.

19:11.202 --> 19:14.264
But we're gonna be strong, chihuahua dogs.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.724
We'll be nervous, but I'm not gonna show it.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.645
I'll guard the figures really well.

19:18.665 --> 19:21.046
We'll take a really good look at them.

19:21.066 --> 19:23.527
A really good look at them.

19:23.547 --> 19:24.928
Because we're guarding them, right?

19:24.988 --> 19:25.748
All the angles.

19:25.988 --> 19:26.968
All the angles.

19:27.608 --> 19:28.809
That's how it's enjoyed.

19:29.229 --> 19:29.549
Yeah.

19:29.789 --> 19:31.050
That's how you guard a figure.

19:31.170 --> 19:31.390
Yeah.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.584
Taking it out of the box and hearing the... You have to take it out of the box!

19:36.684 --> 19:37.305
Okay.

19:37.325 --> 19:38.466
The sound of the plastic.

19:38.567 --> 19:39.928
And the snouts.

19:40.269 --> 19:43.512
And then, you know, taking the figure out!

19:43.853 --> 19:50.961
And then removing the little piece of plastic, the plastic film from the skirt so that there isn't the smudges.

19:51.902 --> 19:55.384
It's like a, welcome home, you're my family!

19:55.424 --> 19:57.905
Yeah, but we're not doing that, we're just guiding them, right?

19:57.945 --> 19:58.566
We're guiding them.

19:58.586 --> 20:00.907
Yeah, no welcoming to the family yet, no, right?

20:03.942 --> 20:05.462
We really like figures.

20:05.743 --> 20:06.823
Can you smell it?

20:06.903 --> 20:08.063
I can smell it!

20:08.183 --> 20:09.844
I can smell the figures!

20:10.244 --> 20:11.544
What's the reason about it?

20:11.604 --> 20:13.024
You're not buying it deshita!

20:13.044 --> 20:14.325
You are buying it all!

20:14.425 --> 20:14.625
No!

20:14.665 --> 20:14.885
No!

20:14.925 --> 20:15.025
Love!

20:15.085 --> 20:15.585
Yeah!

20:16.145 --> 20:17.545
That is how you enjoy it.

20:17.585 --> 20:17.805
Yeah.

20:18.166 --> 20:18.526
Okay.

20:19.186 --> 20:20.486
Don't say it smells bad.

20:20.526 --> 20:21.726
It smells amazing.

20:22.086 --> 20:23.147
It smells beautiful.

20:23.307 --> 20:24.647
Okay.

20:24.807 --> 20:25.127
Yeah.

20:25.407 --> 20:28.088
Very important part of the figure experience.

20:29.691 --> 20:30.192
Got it!

20:30.734 --> 20:32.398
BAU BAU!

20:36.441 --> 20:37.221
On to different news.

20:37.421 --> 20:40.442
I wanna open some figures now, Moco-chan!

20:40.482 --> 20:43.844
Right, right, right!

20:44.564 --> 20:45.224
Wow.

20:46.464 --> 20:49.325
More exciting news though!

20:49.846 --> 20:51.546
Shiori!

20:51.666 --> 20:54.607
A very silly archiver of Advent.

20:55.047 --> 21:01.310
She's gonna be releasing a brand new cover song!

21:01.410 --> 21:03.070
I know she mentioned it a little bit.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.911
After our collaboration.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.012
ZERO TALKING by Harumaki Gohan

21:24.357 --> 21:25.038
Hi!

21:25.138 --> 21:26.419
She's been busy, huh?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.340
Are we okay?

21:27.400 --> 21:31.966
Is it okay to get spoiled this much, huh?

21:32.386 --> 21:36.411
Actually though, FUWAMOCO, we got a bit of a sneak peek.

21:37.332 --> 21:37.412
Hi!

21:39.219 --> 21:42.721
I think you'll love it just as much as we did!

21:42.741 --> 21:42.881
Yeah!

21:42.901 --> 21:45.063
It was very very Shiori!

21:45.083 --> 21:46.163
Very Shiori!

21:46.404 --> 21:48.785
I can tell why she wanted to sing this song.

21:48.925 --> 21:49.105
Yes!

21:49.726 --> 21:50.146
Yeah.

21:50.606 --> 21:51.607
Very Shiori.

21:51.747 --> 21:52.808
Very Shiori!

21:52.828 --> 21:55.589
So please make sure you check it out, okay?

21:55.990 --> 21:56.770
Alright!

21:56.870 --> 22:00.152
It'll be premiering at the end of our Fruv Game Club!

22:00.372 --> 22:00.933
Like we said.

22:01.393 --> 22:01.533
Yeah.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.391
Don't forget, okay?

22:04.112 --> 22:06.214
BAU BAU!

22:06.234 --> 22:13.321
With so many exciting things, so it's gonna be a really fun weekend, Ruffians!

22:14.121 --> 22:14.642
Yeah!

22:15.062 --> 22:21.228
But FUWAMOCO, we also have some little bit of news too from us!

22:21.588 --> 22:22.930
Not really news.

22:23.730 --> 22:24.310
Update!

22:24.410 --> 22:24.991
Update!

22:26.371 --> 22:30.854
You know that this week was, in many ways, FUWAMOCO Ganbare Week.

22:31.274 --> 22:33.315
A little bit more ganbare than I thought.

22:33.335 --> 22:35.216
Yeah, ganbare than other weeks.

22:36.176 --> 22:43.680
But next week, we're going to be taking off next week to be able to focus on homework and some recording.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.581
Just taking it off from streaming.

22:45.601 --> 22:46.642
You know, we feel...

22:49.387 --> 22:55.013
We've been really really going and going and going very hard behind the scenes recently.

22:55.073 --> 22:58.756
Yeah, you know, even today we woke up.

22:59.783 --> 23:01.644
I've been going since 4AM.

23:01.924 --> 23:12.148
You know what, the AX panel, and then the Advent Club, and then we had multiple engagements on our schedule right after that, straight up until prep for FUWAMOCO Morning just now!

23:12.708 --> 23:14.909
That's the usual.

23:14.929 --> 23:16.550
That's how it goes.

23:17.070 --> 23:25.654
But next week, you know, we need to take some time so that we can make sure that we get everything done.

23:27.038 --> 23:31.802
You know, and the flu poisoning that we had, it didn't affect this decision.

23:31.942 --> 23:40.630
We actually decided this a long time ago that, you know, we'd take this week off from streaming to be able to focus on some homework things.

23:40.710 --> 23:48.456
Yeah, by the way, okay, you know, we still have lots and lots of fun stuff planned up, you know, leading up to our one year anniversary!

23:48.656 --> 23:49.237
It's so soon!

23:49.317 --> 23:50.798
It's really, really soon!

23:51.419 --> 23:52.880
Oh my gosh, so soon already!

23:52.900 --> 23:54.101
Sooner than you know it, okay?

23:54.121 --> 23:54.221
Yeah.

23:55.842 --> 23:56.222
Hi?

23:56.522 --> 23:56.642
Hi?

24:15.652 --> 24:17.072
Thank you, Elizabeth!

24:17.592 --> 24:19.453
I still saw you!

24:20.753 --> 24:21.953
What do you mean, Moco-chan?

24:22.013 --> 24:24.854
Is Elizabeth not a special cool high?

24:24.874 --> 24:27.254
Elizabeth is special, but I don't know why it didn't work.

24:27.474 --> 24:28.755
That was Elizabeth!

24:28.815 --> 24:30.015
Why did it not work high?

24:30.575 --> 24:31.335
Oh my goodness.

24:31.875 --> 24:32.816
Have to fix that.

24:33.416 --> 24:36.116
BAU BAU!

24:36.156 --> 24:37.157
We can still see you.

24:37.257 --> 24:38.337
We see you always.

24:38.357 --> 24:39.317
We care about you.

24:39.697 --> 24:40.517
Nothing is fixed.

24:40.657 --> 24:41.677
Except for Nerissa.

24:43.418 --> 24:43.918
Nerissa!

24:50.698 --> 24:50.838
Hi!

24:50.978 --> 24:52.859
I hope you're all doing amazing!

24:52.939 --> 24:54.361
Yeah, thank you!

24:54.381 --> 24:58.584
The food poisoning is goodbye, so that's pretty amazing.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.086
Yeah.

25:00.266 --> 25:06.471
But we hope that, you know, you'll cheer for us and give us lots of power during the week that we're away from streaming.

25:06.571 --> 25:07.152
Yeah.

25:07.332 --> 25:09.194
But of course, Ruffians, you know us.

25:09.214 --> 25:14.758
We'll still update you on Twitter and the YouTube community page when we can, too.

25:14.819 --> 25:15.960
We're not gonna be away.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.761
We're still gonna be here.

25:17.781 --> 25:17.861
Okay.

25:18.201 --> 25:21.782
We're just gonna be chasing our tails a little bit.

25:22.342 --> 25:23.643
Going a bit boopy.

25:23.963 --> 25:25.724
Yeah.

25:25.844 --> 25:29.365
BAU BAU!

25:29.425 --> 25:31.066
Speaking of tails.

25:31.366 --> 25:34.707
Moco-chan, who's the Doggie of the Day today?

25:34.767 --> 25:38.049
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

25:40.029 --> 25:44.170
It's Duke!

25:44.190 --> 25:45.931
Look at Duke!

25:46.011 --> 25:49.291
Duke is such a sweetheart!

25:49.571 --> 25:51.252
That's a pile of puppies, huh?

25:51.872 --> 25:54.733
Yeah, and the best one is right in the center there.

25:54.873 --> 25:56.753
In the center with the big smile!

25:56.953 --> 25:57.793
Right!

25:59.374 --> 26:01.794
Duke, you're so cute!

26:01.834 --> 26:03.795
Very, very docile boy.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.575
I can't tell!

26:05.735 --> 26:08.516
I feel like I just pick up his ears and then go...

26:09.536 --> 26:10.517
Hello!

26:11.077 --> 26:12.378
BAU BAU!

26:12.898 --> 26:19.661
Into his ear and he'd be like... Howl took BAU BAU back.

26:20.462 --> 26:21.282
BAU BAU.

26:22.563 --> 26:23.403
Just like that.

26:23.724 --> 26:24.924
BAU BAU.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.986
That poor dog!

26:28.146 --> 26:28.946
Why?

26:29.046 --> 26:31.087
Can you not see how happy he is?

26:31.107 --> 26:32.068
Ruffians!

26:32.488 --> 26:37.391
Would you be upset if I went up to your ear and went... Hello!

26:39.492 --> 26:45.035
Au revoir!

26:45.415 --> 26:46.396
You would be upset?

26:49.197 --> 26:50.438
I'll remember that then.

26:50.858 --> 26:56.781
Well, I can see that dude loves plushies, but he doesn't.

26:58.221 --> 26:59.062
I think that...

27:00.706 --> 27:02.666
You know what's better than plushies?

27:03.207 --> 27:04.187
It's Duke himself.

27:04.587 --> 27:05.787
He is a big plushie.

27:05.967 --> 27:06.167
Yeah.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.028
And I wanna give him a big hug.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.709
BAU BAU!

27:12.849 --> 27:14.669
Very cute.

27:15.669 --> 27:16.609
So cute.

27:17.270 --> 27:17.830
Okay, well.

27:18.190 --> 27:21.330
Let's stop thinking about Duke and how cute he is.

27:21.711 --> 27:25.211
Let's see Ruffians where have you been going for a walk, huh?

27:26.011 --> 27:28.072
Today I went on a walk of the day.

27:29.998 --> 27:33.239
De-den!

27:33.439 --> 27:34.159
Is this sunset?

27:34.219 --> 27:35.579
Is this sunrise?

27:35.599 --> 27:37.640
That's a good question.

27:38.140 --> 27:39.840
They look different but similar.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.181
You can tell, right?

27:42.221 --> 27:48.822
You know when there's like a beautiful scene and you're like, oh, this is one of the scenes that I can keep to myself.

27:49.782 --> 27:51.203
This is one of those, right?

27:51.223 --> 27:52.723
So thank you for sharing.

27:52.783 --> 27:54.563
I'm glad that you didn't see Pero.

27:55.103 --> 27:56.864
But you saw lots of frogs and fish.

27:57.184 --> 27:57.804
That's nice.

27:59.319 --> 28:00.179
Did you go fishing?

28:00.299 --> 28:01.179
I wanna go fishing.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.500
I really wanna go fishing recently.

28:03.620 --> 28:04.900
I like catching frogs.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.001
Catching frogs?

28:06.121 --> 28:07.221
I wanna go fishing.

28:07.241 --> 28:07.661
Frogs are cute.

28:07.681 --> 28:11.262
And then I wanna cook the fish and not get food poisoning.

28:13.762 --> 28:17.163
Yeah, maybe I'll catch the fish and then Ruffians, you can cook the fish.

28:17.223 --> 28:18.284
Yeah, you can eat it.

28:18.324 --> 28:19.244
Cook it very well.

28:19.264 --> 28:19.844
Yeah.

28:21.025 --> 28:22.747
BAU BAU!

28:24.027 --> 28:26.129
And next we have a question.

28:26.149 --> 28:30.212
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

28:30.432 --> 28:32.653
Hiya, FUWAMOCO!

28:32.833 --> 28:44.101
With the English title that you're going to have with Guzmo soon, I thought this was a little relevant, but is there a character that each of you would love to see become a figure someday?

28:44.121 --> 28:46.103
Each of us is difficult.

28:46.503 --> 28:46.843
Yeah.

28:48.525 --> 28:51.372
Ah, if we say it together Moco-chan, it's not difficult.

28:54.049 --> 28:55.830
2, 1, Multi!

28:55.850 --> 28:57.191
Don't chew hard.

28:57.231 --> 28:59.092
It's a mix of multi.

28:59.232 --> 29:00.473
It's a mix of multi.

29:00.493 --> 29:00.753
Yeah!

29:00.773 --> 29:02.234
Our favorite male robot.

29:02.434 --> 29:08.618
And you know, recently there's been a lot more new figures coming out of like, older characters.

29:08.659 --> 29:22.448
You know, like Saiyan, Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Puppa Pupp

29:22.901 --> 29:23.922
Maybe I imagined it.

29:24.842 --> 29:26.964
It sounds like it's possible.

29:26.984 --> 29:31.087
Yeah, anything's possible, so multi!

29:31.107 --> 29:32.088
I'm waiting.

29:32.628 --> 29:33.229
I'm waiting.

29:33.329 --> 29:36.111
Multi seems like an obvious choice.

29:36.231 --> 29:36.671
Right.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.212
Yeah.

29:39.053 --> 29:39.493
Right.

29:40.154 --> 29:40.594
Yeah.

29:40.614 --> 29:43.176
Always waiting for multi.

29:43.376 --> 29:43.696
Yeah.

29:43.977 --> 29:46.338
And even, you know, two different Kaleidoscores.

29:46.419 --> 29:48.380
Yes, I saw, I saw.

29:48.400 --> 29:48.900
Yeah.

29:49.301 --> 29:52.043
But recently, recently has been within

29:53.343 --> 29:55.423
The last ten years may be.

29:56.204 --> 30:00.564
Well man, another character in 2Heart got a new figure come out.

30:00.844 --> 30:02.045
That's cool.

30:02.185 --> 30:02.485
Multi?

30:02.925 --> 30:03.705
Multi?

30:03.725 --> 30:04.925
What about multi?

30:05.245 --> 30:07.226
I was expecting multi and then multi.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.046
So... I'm waiting.

30:10.426 --> 30:13.067
Ten years is reason for 2Heart, okay?

30:15.127 --> 30:15.967
Multi anything?

30:17.168 --> 30:17.628
Please?

30:18.368 --> 30:19.228
Yeah.

30:20.535 --> 30:22.516
BAU BAU!

30:22.996 --> 30:25.156
Maid robots are good, okay?

30:25.456 --> 30:28.617
BAU BAU!

30:28.757 --> 30:33.499
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

30:34.319 --> 30:39.700
Duke was especially cute, but maybe, you know, I have a doggy of a day that's even cuter than Duke!

30:39.740 --> 30:45.642
Maybe you have a question that's been burning inside you since I even asked, but you weren't able to ask.

30:46.162 --> 30:49.244
You know, maybe you saw a lake that's even more beautiful.

30:49.364 --> 30:54.348
Please send us your submissions with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

30:54.488 --> 31:02.654
Especially if, you know, maybe you spot Pero, but, you know, you're able to stop something horrible happening with a pudding or something.

31:02.854 --> 31:03.595
I'd like to see that.

31:03.635 --> 31:04.575
That would be great.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.137
You know, your information.

31:06.177 --> 31:06.617
Yeah.

31:07.277 --> 31:08.358
We're always waiting!

31:08.458 --> 31:09.699
Okay!

31:09.759 --> 31:11.681
BAU BAU!

31:12.141 --> 31:14.122
And for our next stream,

31:15.023 --> 31:18.786
We have... De-den!

31:19.267 --> 31:21.229
Crab Game!

31:21.289 --> 31:28.094
We're gonna be playing Crab Game for the very first time all together with a bunch of our old I.N.

31:28.175 --> 31:31.057
Senpai and Kouha!

31:31.277 --> 31:32.678
Elizabeth will be there too!

31:34.680 --> 31:39.103
Down on GGS's YouTube!

31:39.143 --> 31:40.284
Can't see her, but she's there.

31:40.604 --> 31:42.125
I'm in the way.

31:43.346 --> 31:48.110
Yeah, I'm more excited to play a game all together with everybody.

31:50.071 --> 31:51.052
Two POVs!

31:51.192 --> 31:53.354
I didn't know you could do that, so probably not.

31:54.074 --> 31:59.598
But we're gonna have a bunch of fun getting to know everybody!

31:59.618 --> 32:00.979
Do we know what crowd game is?

32:01.820 --> 32:01.940
No.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.615
Are you a crab in it?

32:04.635 --> 32:09.117
I know that we're gonna have a bunch of fun.

32:09.137 --> 32:11.338
We're gonna have fun!

32:11.378 --> 32:11.599
Yeah.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.559
No crabs.

32:12.879 --> 32:13.900
Oh, too bad.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.401
That's a weird name then, huh?

32:16.421 --> 32:17.821
Yeah.

32:18.342 --> 32:21.363
Please join us, okay?

32:21.943 --> 32:23.504
Our first collab with our...

32:24.455 --> 32:25.896
Kouhai.

32:26.017 --> 32:27.097
And our senpai!

32:27.117 --> 32:28.499
Yeah, all together!

32:28.599 --> 32:30.481
And our advent buddies.

32:30.501 --> 32:31.622
Our doggy.

32:32.022 --> 32:34.965
BAU BAU!

32:35.105 --> 32:39.148
And let's take a peek at our schedule!

32:39.208 --> 32:40.409
Oh, this is the wrong schedule.

32:40.429 --> 32:40.890
Moco-chan.

32:40.910 --> 32:44.113
Wait a second, wait a second!

32:44.133 --> 32:46.014
That's not our schedule, Moco-chan.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.476
That's confused for a moment.

32:49.617 --> 32:50.097
Deshita!

32:50.958 --> 32:51.559
Deshita!

33:09.376 --> 33:12.898
After that, we're gonna be playing Minecraft!

33:12.978 --> 33:15.219
I love how FUWAMOCO's off to another homework day.

33:15.239 --> 33:17.900
I feel like after another homework day, after another homework day.

33:17.980 --> 33:19.781
Today, I am concerned.

33:19.801 --> 33:28.825
I feel like we're trying to improve at Minecraft, but maybe our progress is a bit slow.

33:30.105 --> 33:32.386
Let's hurry it up with the progress, okay, Moco-chan?

33:32.406 --> 33:33.227
Okay, Moco-chan!

33:33.267 --> 33:34.607
We're recording!

33:34.627 --> 33:35.207
Yeah!

33:35.348 --> 33:38.389
We're not forgetting it, I remember it.

33:39.674 --> 33:40.275
Redstone.

33:41.376 --> 33:42.016
Iron Ore.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.539
I couldn't do it, Ruffians, this time for sure!

33:45.700 --> 33:47.842
And if you don't, it's your fault.

33:48.122 --> 33:53.487
I even have a guide up on one of my screens and Biboo asked about it.

33:53.727 --> 33:54.287
Okay?

33:54.568 --> 33:55.709
I'm not forgetting stuff.

33:57.606 --> 33:59.267
We're ready to make progress.

33:59.307 --> 34:01.629
So please join us, okay?

34:02.109 --> 34:05.731
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:06.132 --> 34:13.316
And for Ruffians who are joining us today through the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO word for the comments.
