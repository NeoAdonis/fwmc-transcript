FUWAMOCO announced the debut of the new hololive EN generation, holoEN -Justice-. They expressed excitement and humorously reassured Ruffians of their innocence despite being pursued by the new generation. FUWAMOCO gave their first impressions about the members of -Justice-:

- Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame, the leader, has a commanding and melodic aura. FUWAMOCO found her proper but intimidating and humorously resolved to avoid her.
- Gigi Murin, described as a grumbler, needs to calm down. FUWAMOCO joked about her bad person smell and her fashion sense, specifically her silly hoodie.
- Cecilia Immergreen, an automaton, is admired for her violin skills but seen as a threat. FUWAMOCO humorously resolved not to be distracted by her beautiful music.
- Raora Panthera's tail is seen as a perfect snack by FUWAMOCO. Despite her strong feline presence, they joked about wanting to get a bite of her tail.

holoEN -Justice- will debut this weekend, with streams starting at 8 PM PT on Friday and Saturday, followed by a big collab on Saturday at 9:30 PM PT.
