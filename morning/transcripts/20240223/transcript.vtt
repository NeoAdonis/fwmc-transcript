05:55.699 --> 05:56.020
Ha!

05:56.320 --> 05:56.660
What?

05:56.740 --> 05:57.561
I write that!

05:59.101 --> 06:01.303
Thank you for being here, Ruffians.

06:02.003 --> 06:09.688
Wow, for Ruffians that are maybe joining us for the first time today, you're able to get up better maybe, you know.

06:09.708 --> 06:10.088
Good job.

06:11.669 --> 06:18.435
Well, to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:18.615 --> 06:19.136

06:49.381 --> 06:52.483
Well Moco-chan, it's a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:53.544 --> 06:55.125
What's today have in store for us?

06:56.086 --> 06:56.807
My trouble.

06:58.628 --> 06:59.649
Trouble?!

07:00.430 --> 07:01.631
My trouble!

07:04.813 --> 07:05.814
What kind of trouble?

07:06.735 --> 07:07.615
Pero trouble.

07:10.177 --> 07:11.879
There's been a Pero Sighting.

07:13.749 --> 07:14.069
Again.

07:14.089 --> 07:16.710
Okay, let's have a look then.

07:16.730 --> 07:21.791
Say then... Oh!

07:22.532 --> 07:22.752
Ah!

07:22.932 --> 07:23.172
Oh!

07:24.412 --> 07:24.852
Oh, look!

07:26.233 --> 07:27.793
Pero's just sitting there!

07:27.853 --> 07:31.254
Yeah, he found a good spot where he can sit comfortably and nicely.

07:31.294 --> 07:32.135
That's pretty nice.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.635
Cool, yeah.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.376
What do you think he's doing, the Ruffians?

07:40.025 --> 07:40.787
Nesting.

07:41.087 --> 07:41.708
Nesting.

07:41.868 --> 07:45.654
I don't know, maybe he beat some squirrels up and overtook their whole base.

07:46.816 --> 07:49.140
Maybe you just got a little too close to him!

07:49.761 --> 07:51.965
And that's why he's giving you the luckiest.

07:52.005 --> 07:52.886
Laying eggs?

07:59.005 --> 08:08.952
Well, you know, I was thinking with spring coming up and everything, I like to think that, you know, maybe he's going to sprout and become a new part to the tree!

08:09.012 --> 08:11.093
You know, like, new growth.

08:11.113 --> 08:11.774
That's nice.

08:11.894 --> 08:12.294
Yeah.

08:13.655 --> 08:16.837
Do you think he'd be beautiful or terrifying?

08:17.597 --> 08:22.801
Maybe he'd bear fruits or blossom with a bunch of pretty flowers?

08:23.281 --> 08:24.202
Ruffians!

08:25.544 --> 08:26.965
G-g-g-grafting?

08:27.185 --> 08:27.805
What?

08:27.885 --> 08:28.545
What?

08:30.006 --> 08:31.366
Beautiful tree!

08:32.666 --> 08:33.487
Terrifying.

08:34.347 --> 08:34.687
Yeah.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.688
This is terrifying.

08:37.868 --> 08:38.869
I guess, yeah.

08:39.209 --> 08:39.509
Yeah.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.990
I don't think Pero's gonna grow into a new part of the tree, huh?

08:43.830 --> 08:46.051
After all, he's Pero!

08:46.671 --> 08:48.132
A demon dog, you know?

08:48.152 --> 08:48.632
Yeah.

08:49.252 --> 08:50.933
I can't do stuff like that.

08:51.733 --> 08:54.734
If there's a Pero tree, then there's a FUWAMOCO tree.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.761
We're Demon Dogs!

08:58.461 --> 08:59.402
BAU BAU!

09:00.162 --> 09:01.623
I don't want to become a tree.

09:01.803 --> 09:02.623
Be careful, okay?

09:02.643 --> 09:05.125
You never know when some scary faces are on trees.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.186
I'm not a tree!

09:07.206 --> 09:08.927
I'm Fuwawa!

09:10.047 --> 09:11.468
I'm not a tree, I'm Mococo.

09:11.488 --> 09:11.848
BAU BAU!

09:11.868 --> 09:13.930
Mighty Fuwamo!

09:21.306 --> 09:23.167
I'm Fuwawa.

09:23.508 --> 09:24.688
What?

09:25.109 --> 09:26.469
Well, Ruffians!

09:27.050 --> 09:33.854
I know we like to say thank you lots, but is it okay if we say thank you more?

09:34.255 --> 09:36.556
Thank you, Ruffians!

09:36.576 --> 09:38.317
Thank you!

09:38.818 --> 09:47.443
Because you know, our newest song cover of Let Me Be With You from the Anime Children's has now over 200,000 views on YouTube!

09:50.365 --> 09:52.126
BAU BAU!

09:52.486 --> 09:52.766
Thank you!

09:52.826 --> 09:53.867
We're really happy!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.287
Thank you Ruffians!

09:55.327 --> 09:57.248
We love seeing all your comments too!

09:57.488 --> 09:58.709
I know!

09:59.169 --> 10:04.631
It seems like we're able to awaken a lot of hidden memories within you.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.593
Maybe remind you of a simpler time!

10:09.113 --> 10:12.055
Simpler time since we watched Chobits for the first time.

10:12.195 --> 10:12.575
Right!

10:14.411 --> 10:16.652
But it makes us really happy, you know?

10:17.773 --> 10:25.377
We hope that you'll continue to listen to our cover lots and lots and that maybe we can help soothe you during your busy days.

10:25.737 --> 10:26.277
You know?

10:26.798 --> 10:27.798
Nostalgic.

10:27.818 --> 10:28.819
Thank you!

10:31.380 --> 10:33.102
BAU BAU!

10:56.504 --> 10:57.864
Well, Ruffians.

10:58.365 --> 11:02.986
You know, all of a sudden, we're nearing the end of this month.

11:03.086 --> 11:04.326
We're here already, huh?

11:04.406 --> 11:05.326
Almost March!

11:05.967 --> 11:06.847
That's pretty weird.

11:06.867 --> 11:12.388
Do you remember what happened at the beginning of this month, Ruffians?

11:15.289 --> 11:16.630
I know I tried to remember.

11:16.650 --> 11:16.850
Right?

11:19.605 --> 11:20.325
That's right!

11:20.586 --> 11:22.787
Our birthdays!

11:22.867 --> 11:24.528
BAU BAU!

11:25.008 --> 11:31.052
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for being there for our big birthday celebration!

11:31.852 --> 11:40.177
As you might know, we also released special birthday merch!

11:40.197 --> 11:42.238
And it's currently on pre-orders!

11:42.298 --> 11:44.540
Yeah, still on pre-orders.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.522
Mococo-san!

11:46.702 --> 11:48.323
There's also Fuwawa-san!

11:48.343 --> 11:49.845
I don't know about them.

11:49.865 --> 11:50.866
They're separate!

11:52.387 --> 11:52.768
Not that.

11:52.908 --> 11:56.972
They're pretty matching too!

11:57.792 --> 11:58.893
Fuwawa-san.

11:59.154 --> 11:59.954
Yes, yes, yes!

11:59.974 --> 12:00.775
Fuwawa-san!

12:01.936 --> 12:06.217
The note that is also still on pre-order so you can get it right now.

12:07.558 --> 12:12.639
But, what we would like you to focus on is our birthday song.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.080
But, but, but, but.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.201
Look, can you find it?

12:18.081 --> 12:22.143
There's the super cute Ruffian questions too!

12:22.483 --> 12:28.925
So Ruffians, if you're interested in grabbing your own too, welcome to your home with Ruffians.

12:29.105 --> 12:38.049
I really recommend that you do so soon because the period window for our birthday merch is going to be ending on March 3rd PT.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.629
March 3rd, okay.

12:39.969 --> 12:43.611
Yeah, before you know it, you're not going to be able to get them.

12:45.501 --> 12:48.183
It's really, really soon.

12:48.223 --> 12:50.165
So please don't forget Ruffians, okay?

12:51.426 --> 12:56.570
We also need to remember to get a few more Ruffians for ourselves too, huh?

12:56.590 --> 12:58.071
Don't forget, Moco-chan.

12:58.851 --> 13:07.078
But also, a big, big thank you to all the Ruffians who have already ordered their birthday merch too.

13:07.358 --> 13:08.719
Thank you so much to Aizen.

13:09.239 --> 13:12.481
We really can't wait for you to receive them in the upcoming months too.

13:12.561 --> 13:16.003
We're looking forward to your photos, okay?

13:16.023 --> 13:18.445
Please take lots, okay?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.267
BAU BAU!

13:21.667 --> 13:24.689
I've been so happy because there's a lot of Ruffians receiving them.

13:25.249 --> 13:27.230
The debut is now!

13:27.571 --> 13:28.771
I'm so excited!

13:28.811 --> 13:30.753
Posting photos, okay!

13:31.473 --> 13:33.474
BAU BAU!

13:33.575 --> 13:39.718
Thank you, Ruffians!

13:39.859 --> 13:44.782
It's the morning!

13:44.802 --> 13:45.602
It's the morning!

13:45.722 --> 13:46.923
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:47.363 --> 13:48.664
Have you had breakfast yet?

13:50.045 --> 13:50.625
Have you?

13:51.026 --> 13:52.026
What are you eating?

13:52.046 --> 13:53.307
I want to know.

13:53.327 --> 13:54.348
This is a good question.

Why?

14:04.102 --> 14:04.182
Why?

14:04.202 --> 14:04.262
Why?

14:04.282 --> 14:04.342
Why?

14:04.362 --> 14:04.442
Why?

14:04.462 --> 14:04.523
Why?

14:04.543 --> 14:04.603
Why?

14:04.623 --> 14:04.683
Why?

14:04.703 --> 14:04.763
Why?

14:04.783 --> 14:04.843
Why?

14:04.863 --> 14:04.923
Why?

14:04.943 --> 14:05.023
Why?

14:05.043 --> 14:05.104
Why?

14:05.124 --> 14:05.184
Why?

14:05.204 --> 14:05.264
Why?

14:05.284 --> 14:05.344
Why

14:05.942 --> 14:07.563
Panola and milk, yum!

14:07.663 --> 14:09.003
Eggs and ham, nice.

14:09.243 --> 14:10.324
Overnight oats, good.

14:10.504 --> 14:11.684
Yum, sure.

14:11.944 --> 14:15.246
Brown sugar bagel, ooh, cute.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.246
Hashbrowns!

14:18.087 --> 14:21.588
Well, kind of on that topic yesterday, Ruffians.

14:21.948 --> 14:31.072
We had a wonderful morning spent having a brunch together, all together with Advent, the Advent Tracks.

14:32.712 --> 14:33.112
It was fun!

14:33.312 --> 14:35.514
It was really fun!

14:35.834 --> 14:39.196
You know... What did we talk about, Moco-chan?

14:39.736 --> 14:41.597
A bunch of silly things, you know?

14:41.617 --> 14:45.980
Like, what we would be if we were a food condiment?

14:46.040 --> 14:46.280
Yeah!

14:46.540 --> 14:53.664
I was surprised that everybody liked talking about that so much, because... I don't know, I thought that was only the topics that I like to think about.

14:54.624 --> 14:55.585
So, I was happy.

14:56.085 --> 14:59.586
You know how much we all really love hash browns.

14:59.606 --> 15:00.226
Hash browns!

15:00.286 --> 15:01.447
hololive hash browns.

15:03.107 --> 15:05.188
You know our dislike for cheese.

15:05.748 --> 15:07.929
Diamond Dogs dislike cheese.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.130
And pillows and our sleeping preferences.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.171
You know typical Advent stuff.

15:15.431 --> 15:15.831
Yeah!

15:15.851 --> 15:16.291
Right!

15:16.351 --> 15:19.852
It was very fun though.

15:20.153 --> 15:20.913
Yeah!

15:21.133 --> 15:22.333
Right, Ruffians?

15:23.754 --> 15:23.914
Huh?

15:24.594 --> 15:24.814
Huh?

15:27.451 --> 15:27.731
What?

15:27.811 --> 15:30.454
What do you mean, Ruffians?

15:32.036 --> 15:35.019
It was just good happy times.

15:35.079 --> 15:35.480
Yeah.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.602
No misunderstandings.

15:38.123 --> 15:38.363
No.

15:38.663 --> 15:39.604
Nothing weird.

15:39.664 --> 15:39.945
No.

15:40.706 --> 15:41.086
Yeah.

15:41.346 --> 15:42.227
It's a very fun talk.

15:42.327 --> 15:42.708
Thank you.

15:42.748 --> 15:44.129
Very fun talk, right?

15:46.232 --> 15:47.133
That was really fun.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.075
A good, a good chill vibe!

15:49.095 --> 15:50.116
Yeah!

15:51.677 --> 15:56.062
You know, but I really hope that we can share more meals all together in the future!

15:56.082 --> 15:56.963
Did you like it?

15:57.503 --> 15:59.645
Ruffians!

16:01.006 --> 16:04.470
I was a little embarrassed eating in front of everybody, but...

16:05.424 --> 16:13.908
But you know, instead of just sharing meals in the future, I'd really like if everyone could all cook our best dishes for each other and share them.

16:14.068 --> 16:14.368
Right?

16:14.508 --> 16:16.269
I wanna try Biboo's fried rice.

16:16.449 --> 16:16.969
Right?

16:16.989 --> 16:17.990
I actually really do too.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.090
I'm curious.

16:19.490 --> 16:19.931
Yeah.

16:22.232 --> 16:26.074
Biboo's Fried Rice sounds like a really, really good recipe, right?

16:26.295 --> 16:26.595
It does!

16:26.615 --> 16:27.835
It's a good name, huh?

16:27.916 --> 16:28.296
Right!

16:28.576 --> 16:30.377
Or a collab.

16:31.017 --> 16:32.518
Maybe one day, huh?

16:32.538 --> 16:35.580
Because we should call it Little Biboo's Fried Rice.

16:36.541 --> 16:37.862
Little Biboo!

16:38.482 --> 16:38.882
Why?

16:39.523 --> 16:43.145
I don't know, it has more of a I-gotta-have-this kind of feeling.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.487
The Little Biboo's Fried Rice.

16:46.407 --> 16:46.747
Right!

16:47.048 --> 16:47.248
Huh?

16:50.690 --> 16:51.370
One day, huh?

16:51.650 --> 16:52.250
One day!

16:52.270 --> 16:52.871
Biboo's karaage too?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.872
It's a full meal.

16:54.892 --> 16:55.012
Right.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.843
I don't know what I'm gonna make because it's all kind of average.

17:03.883 --> 17:07.285
Huh, Moco-chan?

17:07.685 --> 17:08.526
It's all good.

17:10.147 --> 17:12.328
BAU BAU!

17:13.869 --> 17:14.510
You want food?

17:14.530 --> 17:15.831
Well, it's time for breakfast!

17:15.851 --> 17:17.712
Go have food!

17:17.772 --> 17:19.393
If you feel hungry, go have food.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.374
Did I make you hungry?

17:20.394 --> 17:22.335
You better go eat then.

17:22.355 --> 17:24.496
That was our plan all along!

17:25.037 --> 17:26.638
BAU BAU!

17:33.162 --> 17:40.506
Ruffians.

17:43.008 --> 17:44.289
It's all my fault.

17:46.150 --> 17:53.154
Because, well, uh... Well, you know how Moco-chan and I, we worked so hard at everything.

17:53.594 --> 17:57.857
Because, well, you know, there was the... The update.

17:58.851 --> 18:08.096
You know when we were really really lucky to be able to play the new Suica game update with you the other day right after it just came out and everything.

18:08.116 --> 18:09.837
Yeah, we worked hard as we could.

18:10.377 --> 18:18.782
Well... When we were playing, I maybe got a bit carried away.

18:18.802 --> 18:18.862
And...

18:22.555 --> 18:24.377
It's not really my fault though.

18:24.778 --> 18:29.904
It's SuikaGames' fault for making the two-player DLC so intense.

18:32.881 --> 18:38.646
You know, we were able to play the new 2-player DLC together.

18:39.267 --> 18:42.530
And they had a bunch of fun new mods.

18:42.610 --> 18:43.090
It was fun.

18:43.510 --> 18:46.413
Not just like the original mod, that would be pretty great.

18:46.813 --> 18:50.837
But they also had the attack mod and the time-based mod too.

18:51.237 --> 18:51.978
They were good.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.639
They were good.

18:53.679 --> 18:54.901
They were all really fun.

18:56.596 --> 18:59.357
I might have gotten a bit serious about it too.

18:59.477 --> 19:02.358
After all, we are seriously silly.

19:03.158 --> 19:09.320
And, well, maybe I wasn't doing as great as I had hoped.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.521
And I kind of got pretty worked up.

19:14.642 --> 19:22.424
And I may have made a sound that sounded similar to a cat's hiss.

19:24.414 --> 19:24.614
But!

19:25.175 --> 19:25.415
But!

19:26.036 --> 19:27.638
It's not my fault, okay?

19:27.758 --> 19:30.722
It's the game's fault, and Moco-chan's fault!

19:31.162 --> 19:32.364
Why is it my fault?

19:33.986 --> 19:34.446
Huh?

19:35.588 --> 19:36.509
No, Moco-chan.

19:37.330 --> 19:42.256
But, well, I guess Ruffians, what I wanted to say...

19:44.699 --> 19:53.225
Is that I'm sorry that I got caught up and I made a sound that could be interpreted as a hiss.

19:55.046 --> 19:55.967
I'm a demon dog.

19:56.547 --> 19:57.388
I'm not a cat.

20:00.310 --> 20:01.371
You know this, right?

20:01.991 --> 20:02.311
Yeah.

20:02.531 --> 20:08.696
I'll make sure you know that I don't make any more mistakes like this in the future, okay, Ruffians?

20:08.936 --> 20:09.676
You promise?

20:11.578 --> 20:12.358
You promise?

20:15.862 --> 20:17.042
BAU BAU.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.004
Next time I'm gonna beat you.

20:20.024 --> 20:20.864
No you won't!

20:21.504 --> 20:24.766
Next time I'm gonna beat you.

20:24.786 --> 20:25.346
BAU BAU!

20:25.426 --> 20:28.347
Let's play more Suika games!

20:29.547 --> 20:30.628
BAU BAU!

20:30.728 --> 20:32.289
BAU BAU!

20:32.469 --> 20:35.450
I'll win again.

20:35.470 --> 20:35.630
Nope!

20:35.870 --> 20:37.291
BAU BAU!

20:44.145 --> 20:53.787
Actually, today, we have something a bit special today.

20:56.568 --> 20:58.088
Moco-chan.

20:58.669 --> 21:05.050
Well, it's not that day of the week, but... Is it okay?

21:05.330 --> 21:05.730
Is it?

21:07.451 --> 21:07.911
Is it?

21:08.971 --> 21:11.072
You know, we thought it might be nice, so...

21:13.973 --> 21:15.174
Yeah!

21:16.934 --> 21:20.376
Yeah!

21:20.436 --> 21:21.557
Yeah!

21:21.577 --> 21:23.397
Okay!

21:24.038 --> 21:25.438
Ruffians!

21:26.059 --> 21:28.820
Today is a special day!

21:30.261 --> 21:31.781
For the first time ever!

21:32.502 --> 21:37.524
Well, it's time for our FUWAMOCO Fun Talk!

21:38.104 --> 21:42.887
And you're going to hear it straight from us, FUWAMOCO!

21:45.703 --> 21:46.363
Ruffians!

21:48.224 --> 21:49.324
Hello!

21:49.644 --> 21:50.644
Hello!

21:50.964 --> 21:54.085
Good job with everything recently!

21:54.425 --> 21:55.425
Even working hard!

21:55.445 --> 21:56.526
And look!

21:56.886 --> 21:59.166
You know, we're almost through winter!

21:59.566 --> 22:02.347
Blossoms are beginning to bloom on the trees!

22:03.027 --> 22:06.868
You know, slowly but surely, it's getting a bit brighter outside!

22:07.388 --> 22:09.569
And you know what spring means!

22:11.255 --> 22:13.057
It means a new start!

22:13.217 --> 22:15.378
New challenges!

22:15.779 --> 22:19.142
Everything is fresh.

22:19.342 --> 22:23.125
At times, you know, it can be a bit scary.

22:23.765 --> 22:27.408
But change can be very exciting too.

22:27.448 --> 22:31.892
Change can mean that you get closer to the things you feel very passionate about.

22:32.292 --> 22:35.055
Closer to your burning dreams.

22:35.815 --> 22:40.937
It can also bring new scary mountains and some deep valleys as well.

22:41.738 --> 22:43.579
But... You're strong!

22:43.659 --> 22:44.099
Yeah!

22:44.159 --> 22:45.079
You're strong!

22:45.680 --> 22:50.822
You know, even if it takes you a little longer, you can overcome them all, okay?

22:50.902 --> 22:51.102
Yeah.

22:51.342 --> 22:53.083
You're resilient!

22:53.103 --> 22:56.004
So don't be scared of change and challenge yourself.

22:56.745 --> 23:03.568
And even if maybe things don't go exactly as you imagined, you'll end somewhere new and filled with possibilities.

23:04.068 --> 23:17.598
More importantly, please remember that when everything is overwhelming and you're not too sure how things are going to go, tell yourself that everything will work out in the end.

23:18.018 --> 23:18.859
It'll be okay!

23:19.299 --> 23:19.800
It will!

23:20.420 --> 23:21.541
I believe in you!

23:21.781 --> 23:23.402
I believe in you too!

23:23.963 --> 23:25.004
You can do this!

23:25.204 --> 23:26.084
We all can!

23:26.505 --> 23:27.686
We can do it!

23:28.246 --> 23:29.347
Ganbatte deshita!

23:30.507 --> 23:34.029
BAU BAU!

23:34.249 --> 23:37.811
We can do it, Ruffians!

23:39.191 --> 23:40.432
You can do it!

23:40.792 --> 23:49.236
Well, Ruffians, we also have something else we'd like to share today.

23:50.036 --> 23:51.417
Wow, you know that

23:52.363 --> 24:01.913
We gave you a heads up a few weeks ago, but this next upcoming week, we won't be putting out a streaming schedule.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.357
Yeah, you remember, right?

24:06.238 --> 24:07.279
It's a bit scary.

24:08.580 --> 24:12.565
The first time there hasn't been a schedule for us since debut, right?

24:15.919 --> 24:25.967
We wanted to let you know, Ruffians, that this also means that there will be a bit of a temporary break for FUWAMOCO Morning.

24:26.568 --> 24:27.989
We'll be right back to it, okay?

24:28.309 --> 24:31.591
But for now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be on a bit of a break.

24:31.712 --> 24:32.632
It just can't be helped.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.414
Can't be helped.

24:34.614 --> 24:40.399
But we hope that you'll be waiting with anticipation for FUWAMOCO Morning's return when it comes back though.

24:40.419 --> 24:41.159
Don't wait!

24:44.767 --> 24:46.168
No way, okay!

24:46.228 --> 24:50.870
Why is the first comment, I see, DOOM?

24:50.950 --> 24:51.651
Ruffians!

24:52.331 --> 24:53.392
You're being silly.

24:53.672 --> 24:57.254
We just want to keep you on a loop is all, too.

24:57.674 --> 25:00.435
You don't have to worry, you don't have to panic, okay?

25:00.455 --> 25:03.177
It's not that big of a deal, Ruffians.

25:04.117 --> 25:12.182
Like we mentioned, you know, Ruffians, we feel so incredibly lucky to be a part of your life, to be a part of your morning, you know?

25:13.206 --> 25:16.028
You know, three times a week with FUWAMOCO Morning.

25:16.608 --> 25:22.052
So we're really looking forward to more time, more mornings, more FUWAMOCO Mornings together.

25:22.132 --> 25:23.053
Okay.

25:23.353 --> 25:24.654
We don't want you to panic.

25:25.074 --> 25:27.696
We just, you know, it's your schedule too.

25:27.816 --> 25:28.537
Yeah.

25:28.937 --> 25:30.398
So we want to keep you in the loop.

25:30.578 --> 25:33.080
This doesn't mean that you can sleep in the whole office.

25:33.120 --> 25:33.920
No, it doesn't, okay?

25:33.980 --> 25:36.382
Yeah, no bad habits forming, okay?

25:36.462 --> 25:36.862
No, no.

25:37.262 --> 25:37.443
Okay.

25:38.263 --> 25:40.205
We just wanted to let you know.

25:41.447 --> 25:47.333
Because maybe there's some ruffians that didn't quite put everything together there.

25:47.353 --> 25:48.234
The no schedule.

25:48.394 --> 25:51.258
And then going to Gorilla Streams.

25:51.278 --> 25:53.881
So we just wanted to let you know, okay?

25:55.277 --> 25:56.037
BAU BAU!

25:56.057 --> 25:56.878
BAU BAU!

25:56.998 --> 25:57.358
BAU BAU!

25:57.418 --> 25:57.838
BAU BAU!

25:57.878 --> 25:58.338

26:22.286 --> 26:22.306
B

26:24.248 --> 26:29.973
You know, Omi is a happy older puppy who adores Coraline.

26:29.993 --> 26:30.694
I can tell!

26:30.734 --> 26:33.597
That is a very big smile.

26:34.517 --> 26:39.943
But actually, he doesn't know it yet, but he's on the way to the vet.

26:43.484 --> 26:43.644
Oops.

26:44.885 --> 26:45.766
BAU BAU.

26:45.806 --> 26:46.646
BAU BAU!

26:47.107 --> 26:47.547
Yeah.

26:47.867 --> 26:48.868
It'll be okay, Ruffians.

26:48.968 --> 26:49.968
It'll be okay.

26:50.028 --> 26:50.289
Yeah.

26:50.329 --> 26:51.409
He's having fun.

26:51.489 --> 26:51.890
Yeah.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.471
He doesn't know yet, but... He doesn't know.

26:55.492 --> 26:56.753
He's in for a surprise.

26:57.073 --> 26:57.373
Yeah.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.856
Well, how does only BAU BAU?

27:00.876 --> 27:02.117
Maybe sort of...

27:02.857 --> 27:03.618
BAU BAU!

27:04.058 --> 27:04.178
Oh!

27:05.119 --> 27:06.300
BAU BAU!

27:06.320 --> 27:07.901
BAU BAU!

27:08.562 --> 27:11.765
Maybe, you know, on the drive we get some Puppuccino.

27:12.105 --> 27:14.987
Always, always, I want a Puppuccino!

27:15.148 --> 27:15.908
BAU BAU!

27:16.369 --> 27:16.709
BAU BAU!

27:16.769 --> 27:18.911
BAU BAU PUPPUCCINO!

27:18.951 --> 27:19.291
BAU BAU!

27:23.331 --> 27:25.112
It's just like that.

27:25.213 --> 27:25.873
Exactly!

27:26.393 --> 27:27.214
Very exciting.

27:27.494 --> 27:28.155
Right?

27:28.555 --> 27:33.159
Well, you know, Omi is the best doggo you could ever wish for.

27:33.199 --> 27:41.765
You know, he's chill, he loves to go for rides with you, and Age won't stop his fashion sense.

27:41.986 --> 27:52.074
Yeah, so even if you're taking him to the vet, he'll just sit there and smile because that means that he gets to go for another ride together with you.

27:53.317 --> 27:54.819
Such a wonderful, wonderful day.

27:55.039 --> 27:57.422
Even if you know that means he's gonna end up with a bat.

27:57.822 --> 27:58.403
It's okay.

27:58.583 --> 27:59.143
Yeah.

27:59.163 --> 27:59.644
It's good.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.187
BAU BAU!

28:03.468 --> 28:03.889
Right?

28:04.049 --> 28:05.711
Omi's adorable.

28:05.731 --> 28:07.633
Thank you.

28:08.293 --> 28:10.536
And for today, I went on a walk.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.818
We have De-den!

28:15.154 --> 28:15.434
Ms.

28:16.155 --> 28:16.916
Donuts?

28:17.617 --> 28:18.077
Huh?

28:18.598 --> 28:18.858
Ms.

28:18.938 --> 28:19.539
Donuts?

28:20.520 --> 28:21.541
Mister Donuts?

28:21.621 --> 28:21.861
Ms.

28:21.881 --> 28:22.402
Donuts.

28:22.462 --> 28:22.682
Ms.

28:22.742 --> 28:23.203
Donuts.

28:23.443 --> 28:28.428
It's like Perroccino and Peroncina!

28:28.528 --> 28:30.090
I guess it could happen.

28:30.791 --> 28:33.434
Ruffians, this is shocking news!

28:34.924 --> 28:44.350
Miss Donut, it's too bad that they didn't sub on the rings, but we're glad that you still had a good walk during your month's break.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.511
Maybe you got a nice snack too.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.852
Thank you Miss Donut for the nice snack.

28:49.473 --> 28:49.773
BAU BAU!

28:50.813 --> 28:52.514
BAU BAU!

28:53.354 --> 28:58.196
And for the question of the day, we have the dance!

28:58.296 --> 29:00.417
Konnichiwa, FUWAMOCO-chan!

29:00.457 --> 29:02.217
Konnichiwa!

29:02.337 --> 29:06.899
I watched a video about how different it feels to talk in English and Japanese.

29:07.179 --> 29:12.361
Do you notice a difference in how you talk and feel when speaking in English or Japanese?

29:12.761 --> 29:18.804
Do you sometimes mix the language or talk in Japanese or English secretly to each other in public?

29:21.731 --> 29:29.193
I think, you know, it really is very different for us, you know, the differences between speaking English versus Japanese.

29:29.833 --> 29:37.914
I feel like this probably goes with each language, but you can express different sides of yourself with like different languages, you know.

29:38.334 --> 29:41.815
It's a little bit strange, but I think it's cool too.

29:41.975 --> 29:45.136
I think if you're bilingual, you'll probably understand a bit right.

29:47.316 --> 29:50.497
I feel like, you know, we have a lot to say in English.

29:50.517 --> 29:53.397
We also have a lot to say in Japanese, too!

29:53.778 --> 29:53.918
Yeah!

29:54.058 --> 29:56.598
Yeah, I think we can be pretty silly in Japanese.

29:58.018 --> 30:01.839
There's things that we can say in Japanese that we want to say, but we can't really say in English.

30:01.859 --> 30:02.119
Yeah.

30:02.399 --> 30:05.020
You know, it's just that each language has its own strength.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.761
Not that one is particularly right or wrong.

30:07.821 --> 30:09.221
It's different, you know, right?

30:09.241 --> 30:10.141
Yeah.

30:10.781 --> 30:11.041
Yeah.

30:11.301 --> 30:12.282
Have you noticed this?

30:12.822 --> 30:13.362
Maybe that...

30:14.369 --> 30:16.930
We have lots of fun in both languages.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.090
As for mixing them though...

30:37.381 --> 30:38.722
Moco-chan understands Japanese.

30:38.742 --> 30:40.224
Moco-chan understands English.

30:54.898 --> 30:57.539
So, does it really matter?

30:58.120 --> 30:59.901
We're always together, you know?

30:59.941 --> 31:04.163
So, even if it's a mix of everything, we can understand each other.

31:04.203 --> 31:06.304
So, you know, we don't have any issues there.

31:06.604 --> 31:07.325
It's sort of silly.

31:07.745 --> 31:12.367
Even if we don't use words, we still understand each other.

31:13.848 --> 31:16.269
Is that English even that important in the end?

31:23.641 --> 31:24.662
Understandable.

31:24.902 --> 31:33.505
Thank you so much, Moco, for all your submissions of FUWAMOCO Morning.

31:33.946 --> 31:36.567
We'll continue to look on out for that.

31:37.407 --> 31:42.630
So please make sure you keep on sending your walks, your doggy of the days, your questions!

31:43.091 --> 31:46.573
Okay, even while FUWAMOCO Morning's on, a little bit of a break.

31:47.113 --> 31:47.953
Even more so.

31:48.334 --> 31:49.855
Yeah, even more so, right?

31:50.355 --> 31:51.916
Okay, Ruffians!

31:52.156 --> 31:53.757
Don't forget now, okay?

31:54.257 --> 31:55.938
BAU BAU!

31:56.399 --> 32:00.461
Well, for our next team, we have... De-den!

32:00.541 --> 32:06.124
Tonight we're gonna be playing Suspicious Person Information.

32:07.918 --> 32:09.119
I don't know what to expect!

32:11.781 --> 32:14.483
I wonder who the suspicious person's gonna be, huh?

32:15.663 --> 32:16.384
Not us.

32:16.764 --> 32:17.545
Not us.

32:18.665 --> 32:18.986
Yeah.

32:19.526 --> 32:20.887
Fuwawa Chihokuzu!

32:21.087 --> 32:21.647
Fushi- Nope!

32:21.807 --> 32:21.988
Nope!

32:22.208 --> 32:22.408
Nope!

32:22.648 --> 32:22.848
Nope!

32:22.968 --> 32:23.509
Chigau yo!

32:23.649 --> 32:24.069
I'm not!

32:24.549 --> 32:25.750
No, that's somebody else.

32:26.431 --> 32:26.691
Yeah.

32:27.968 --> 32:31.614
BAU BAU!

32:32.315 --> 32:39.706
And if we take another look at our schedule, this weekend we have our big Rock n' Rawr party!

32:40.026 --> 32:41.308
Wait, that's tomorrow.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.611
Tomorrow Ruffians!

32:44.991 --> 32:48.255
We're gonna have so much fun!

32:48.396 --> 32:53.081
And then it's time for us to share our big announcement with you!

32:53.241 --> 32:55.184
We really hope that you'll join us.

32:55.745 --> 32:56.986
It's very exciting.

32:57.046 --> 32:57.787
Not today!

32:57.887 --> 32:59.189
Tomorrow!

33:01.952 --> 33:04.735
Please be there!

33:04.895 --> 33:07.677
It's gonna be a big party, okay?

33:08.838 --> 33:11.381
The rockin'est, rollin'est party!

33:11.401 --> 33:12.502
That's for sure!

33:12.522 --> 33:12.842
BAU BAU!

33:12.862 --> 33:19.128
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us!

33:19.688 --> 33:33.211
Today for FUWAMOCO Morning, as well as all the FUWAMOCO Mornings before today's episode, all of the previous ones, whether it was Episode 1, Episode 26, Episode 32, or today, Episode 84.

33:33.571 --> 33:37.953
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

33:38.333 --> 33:45.434
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

33:45.774 --> 33:46.755
Mostly safe!

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
