04:42.050 --> 04:45.140
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

04:45.380 --> 04:48.942
It's time for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

04:48.962 --> 04:53.024
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

04:53.084 --> 04:55.425
BAU BAU!

04:56.006 --> 04:58.647
I'm a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

04:58.807 --> 05:01.108
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:01.128 --> 05:03.709
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:03.750 --> 05:04.130
BAU BAU!

05:05.391 --> 05:09.134
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:10.395 --> 05:11.556
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:11.836 --> 05:16.380
Thank you for joining us for our 19th episode!

05:17.641 --> 05:18.542
Almost 20, Moco-chan!

05:22.840 --> 05:23.660
Ruffians!

05:24.480 --> 05:26.121
How are you doing today?

05:26.861 --> 05:28.841
It's the middle of the week!

05:29.221 --> 05:34.223
But I definitely saw some Ruffians that said it's their first time today for FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:34.263 --> 05:42.484
So, to explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

05:42.724 --> 05:43.284
A.K.A.

05:43.304 --> 05:44.105
FUWAMOCO!

05:44.465 --> 05:47.285
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

05:47.485 --> 05:47.805
Yes!

05:51.046 --> 05:56.372
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

05:56.632 --> 06:02.898
Ruffians, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:03.198 --> 06:06.942
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:07.162 --> 06:09.384
BAU BAU!

06:10.545 --> 06:14.470
Well, Moco-chan, do you think a Ruffian might have spotted Pero?

06:15.151 --> 06:15.731
I think so.

06:15.811 --> 06:20.016
There's been another Pero Sighting.

06:20.557 --> 06:22.359
Where has Pero seen this time?

06:25.681 --> 06:27.222
Pero is floating.

06:27.523 --> 06:29.265
Floating down a small stream.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.927
He looks very peaceful.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.650
He almost looks as peaceful as the water itself.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.953
Maybe he's just made of water.

06:38.254 --> 06:39.275
Water and bones.

06:39.575 --> 06:40.316
That's how it works.

06:40.376 --> 06:41.898
That's how it works.

06:41.918 --> 06:46.022
You know he just keeps on going and spitting and spitting.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.424
Maybe we can just let him be there.

06:48.624 --> 06:48.944
Maybe.

06:49.044 --> 06:50.085
Enjoy it.

06:50.165 --> 06:55.269
Sometimes it's kind of nice to just take a moment and let the world take control of your body, right?

06:56.029 --> 06:58.131
Yeah, he's just going.

06:58.471 --> 06:59.972
Maybe it's kind of like meditation.

07:00.272 --> 07:00.712
Right.

07:01.373 --> 07:03.294
He looks very round and fluffy.

07:03.414 --> 07:04.715
Fluffy, very fluffy.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.837
Maybe just a bit more plump than usual.

07:06.877 --> 07:10.519
Maybe he sucked up all the water or drank some.

07:11.059 --> 07:12.681
It's so good!

07:13.181 --> 07:15.983
Thank you for spotting him and just letting him be.

07:16.323 --> 07:18.945
I think this was a good decision this time.

07:19.045 --> 07:22.647
If you ever see Pero floating, just let him be.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.629
It's probably safest like that.

07:25.989 --> 07:27.750
BAU BAU!

07:27.850 --> 07:30.772
Please let us know if you see Pero again, okay Ruffians?

07:31.152 --> 07:36.855
Remember, you can use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

07:37.215 --> 07:41.218
BAU BAU!

07:41.858 --> 07:42.859
Ruffians, did you know?

07:44.355 --> 07:45.796
Today is an important day.

07:45.816 --> 07:56.921
It is an important day because today is the day three years ago that our senpai that missed debuted!

07:59.443 --> 08:01.744
I can't believe it's been three years.

08:01.784 --> 08:05.045
Thank you, Moco-chan, for the beautiful drawing of Rai.

08:05.586 --> 08:10.228
Rai-time has gone so fast, right, Ruffians?

08:10.308 --> 08:11.629
You didn't forget, of course.

08:13.377 --> 08:13.858
No!

08:14.319 --> 08:18.005
But you know, three years ago they debuted.

08:18.426 --> 08:19.969
Time has gone so fast.

08:20.009 --> 08:23.815
Now they're gonna be going on to their fourth year as members of hololive.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.438
Four years.

08:26.010 --> 08:27.712
Ina looks sleepy.

08:27.732 --> 08:30.495
She is very happy.

08:30.655 --> 08:32.657
It's the anniversary.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.459
Thumbs up.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.985
Within this period of time, look at all they've accomplished.

08:39.165 --> 08:43.369
All the happiness, the laughs, the entertainment that they've brought to everybody.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.233
We really admire that.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.243
Imagine what our third anniversary will be like, right Moco-chan?

08:50.483 --> 08:51.644
Ruffians, what do you think?

08:52.125 --> 08:53.106
Three years.

08:53.346 --> 08:54.927
What will we be like then?

08:55.007 --> 08:57.470
How many FUWAMOCO Mornings will that be?

08:57.490 --> 08:58.671
A lot.

09:01.192 --> 09:10.400
You know, we really hope that we can accomplish as much as our senpai have, and we're looking forward to seeing what they'll continue to be creating from here on out.

09:10.940 --> 09:13.062
Let's all celebrate lots today with them!

09:13.342 --> 09:17.005
You know, at the 3rd anniversary stream, I think it's starting at 2pm BT.

09:17.065 --> 09:17.545
5am GST.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.307
You'll be at 5... 6am, 6am.

09:25.332 --> 09:29.514
Good morning everyone!

09:29.554 --> 09:35.578
You're not gonna miss it too, right?

09:36.459 --> 09:38.640
Congratulations, miss!

09:38.700 --> 09:42.603
Ruffians, let's all make sure to say good congratulations to miss, okay?

09:43.163 --> 09:45.585
Third anniversary only happens once, you know?

09:45.745 --> 09:46.245
It's true.

09:46.405 --> 09:46.805
BAU BAU!

09:46.825 --> 09:46.885
Wow.

09:53.057 --> 09:57.940
Next up, we have something that we kinda need to confess.

09:59.961 --> 10:01.102
Is it a bad confess?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.182
Is it a good confess?

10:03.683 --> 10:06.064
I don't know, but we have to confess.

10:09.326 --> 10:12.488
Ruffians, how have you been feeling recently?

10:13.688 --> 10:16.070
Has your BAU BAU build been getting any better?

10:16.090 --> 10:18.131
Has it?

10:31.719 --> 10:35.141
I thought you were gonna say turtle.

10:35.522 --> 10:37.363
It's so bad, it became a turtle.

10:39.185 --> 10:43.649
For us FUWAMOCO, you know, we don't really have BAU BAU, you know?

10:43.669 --> 10:44.289
BAU BAU is life.

10:45.791 --> 10:46.091
Right?

10:46.131 --> 10:56.841
But we realize, you know, the less time we spend together with you, Ruffians, the more uneasy, the more uncomfortable we kind of get.

10:57.061 --> 11:01.886
We want to be able to spend as much time as possible with you, you know, all together.

11:02.526 --> 11:03.667
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

11:03.727 --> 11:05.908
You're right.

11:06.228 --> 11:10.189
You know, we're always thinking about what we can do to make you smile more.

11:10.249 --> 11:15.432
Maybe if we were to do this or that, or maybe something like that would be better.

11:15.472 --> 11:16.292
Those kind of things.

11:17.172 --> 11:19.594
We're doing our all to make things come true.

11:20.074 --> 11:23.775
You know, sometimes even if it's tricky or a bit scary.

11:23.835 --> 11:24.536
Scary.

11:25.256 --> 11:26.977
Yeah, we're gonna do our best.

11:27.799 --> 11:34.325
But we want you to know that your heartfelt messages and support and creations will really mean a lot to us right now.

11:34.405 --> 11:35.947
I really, really do.

11:36.567 --> 11:39.090
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

11:39.130 --> 11:43.194
Thank you for giving us the push, the power that we need, you know?

11:43.574 --> 11:48.499
If it's okay, can we continue to rely on you?

11:52.015 --> 11:53.857
Is that okay?

11:53.917 --> 11:55.920
I need to be strong for the Ruffians, right?

11:56.040 --> 11:56.580
I'm strong!

11:56.661 --> 11:57.802
I am strong!

11:58.443 --> 12:08.876
BAU BAU, thank you Ruffians!

12:10.484 --> 12:12.025
Bye!

12:12.105 --> 12:14.505
Let's try to be strong though, okay?

12:14.826 --> 12:17.186
Guard Dogs, we are tough.

12:17.767 --> 12:20.047
Wow, Ruffians.

12:20.648 --> 12:22.168
This is quite an embarrassing show.

12:22.308 --> 12:28.591
I don't know if this counts as a... As a... What does it count as?

12:29.391 --> 12:30.751
As a confession?

12:30.771 --> 12:31.071
Confession!

12:31.151 --> 12:31.752
Ruffians.

12:38.797 --> 12:40.638
I don't know how you're doing, you know.

12:41.398 --> 12:47.140
Recently, you know, FUWAMOCO, it's been a bit busy.

12:47.540 --> 12:51.742
Things have gotten a bit messy here and there.

12:52.262 --> 13:02.846
You know how you just kind of look down at the ground and sometimes you start to notice that, oh my gosh, there's a lot of fluff, there's a lot of fuzz gathered up in the corner there.

13:03.206 --> 13:04.407
You know, that sort of thing.

13:05.923 --> 13:08.165
How have you been doing, Ruffians?

13:08.685 --> 13:09.966
Is everything sparkling?

13:10.626 --> 13:12.627
You're taking care of everything, it's all good!

13:12.647 --> 13:13.868
No dirty dishes?

13:15.028 --> 13:22.553
There's no dirty dishes for us, you know, because I've been doing really well, but maybe things have been getting a little rough here and there.

13:22.873 --> 13:24.954
The fluff and the fuzz, the fluff and the fuzz!

13:25.034 --> 13:27.476
It just gets everywhere, okay?

13:27.516 --> 13:29.757
You've been keeping it clean, that's good!

13:31.338 --> 13:31.759
I don't know.

13:31.879 --> 13:43.590
When it gets to a level then it's just like... So we were thinking, if it's ok, we wanted to ask you for some assistance.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.391
Some help, you know?

13:47.693 --> 13:48.054
3 p.m.

13:48.114 --> 13:51.716
PT, we're thinking... Oh, that's 7 a.m.

13:51.736 --> 13:52.777
PT.

13:53.017 --> 14:01.263
We're thinking that maybe we would do our first Twitter Space and then that way we could tidy up all together!

14:01.303 --> 14:04.105
How does that sound, Ruffians?

14:07.563 --> 14:13.569
It's not very fun, but maybe if you're here with us, then it's not so bad, right?

14:13.589 --> 14:18.634
Yeah, you know, we have you, and then you have us, and then we can all clean up together, right?

14:18.694 --> 14:19.075
Right?

14:22.006 --> 14:26.528
It might get a little bit live with some scrubbing and some vacuuming in there.

14:26.548 --> 14:30.270
But if you don't mind it, then... Right!

14:30.890 --> 14:31.930
Can we post a picture?

14:32.130 --> 14:33.211
Oh, of course, of course!

14:33.331 --> 14:33.871
A picture?

14:33.891 --> 14:36.352
Like, afterwards, you know?

14:36.372 --> 14:37.312
Like, hashtag.

14:37.513 --> 14:38.073
Not before.

14:38.093 --> 14:40.034
Right, right, right!

14:40.354 --> 14:41.614
We'll see, we'll see!

14:41.634 --> 14:43.535
We'll see, we'll see!

14:43.615 --> 14:43.975
Yeah.

14:44.015 --> 14:45.456
Ruffians, you could, but...

14:47.253 --> 14:48.474
Maybe the after, you know?

14:48.514 --> 14:49.454
Show your hard work.

14:49.894 --> 14:51.935
And if it was clean beforehand then, you know?

14:51.975 --> 14:53.696
Not before and after, okay?

14:53.776 --> 14:56.137
No, not before.

14:56.197 --> 14:58.297
We'll see, we'll see.

14:58.558 --> 15:00.558
Moco-chan, it's a big we'll see.

15:01.239 --> 15:03.940
It's a big we'll see.

15:03.980 --> 15:07.981
We're gonna be looking forward to our first twitters with Ruffians!

15:08.241 --> 15:08.642
Asano.

15:09.182 --> 15:09.482
Sou.

15:10.022 --> 15:10.542
Asano.

15:10.963 --> 15:11.983
Shichiji desu.

15:12.263 --> 15:13.484
Clean up early in the morning.

15:15.004 --> 15:15.505
I think so.

15:15.605 --> 15:16.926
I don't know though.

15:33.815 --> 15:34.776
Thank you!

15:34.816 --> 15:36.898
Let's all get our cleaning supplies ready.

15:36.958 --> 15:41.262
Although, FUWAMOCO we don't really... It's not that bad.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.624
It's just uncomfortable.

15:43.644 --> 15:45.546
So don't misunderstand, okay?

15:45.686 --> 15:46.807
It's not horrible.

15:47.248 --> 15:49.770
It's just not nice anymore.

15:49.810 --> 15:53.234
You know it'd be nicer to do with the Ruffians, right?

15:53.334 --> 15:56.437
This way it'll be all fun together, okay?

15:56.577 --> 15:57.458
Spring cleaning.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.582
It's...summer is almost over.

16:02.622 --> 16:07.345
Fall cleaning!

16:07.905 --> 16:11.448
Let's do our best to get our hands BAU BAU!

16:13.420 --> 16:15.502
I'm excited for that fight, Moco-chan.

16:17.563 --> 16:19.084
You don't have anything else.

16:19.685 --> 16:21.166
Nothing else for today, right?

16:22.467 --> 16:24.168
Well, actually, Moco-chan.

16:25.629 --> 16:28.291
There's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

16:28.691 --> 16:29.312
I don't know!

16:29.332 --> 16:32.254
A bit of a misunderstanding.

16:33.435 --> 16:36.217
Something that I thought we should clear up, so...

16:37.375 --> 16:44.482
Yeah, I didn't really want to bring attention to it because I didn't want any Ruffians to misunderstand further.

16:44.502 --> 16:46.163
So maybe it's a bit late.

16:46.704 --> 16:50.207
Yeah, but I have a day doing Donkey Kong Country.

16:50.547 --> 16:53.250
You know, Ruffians, I asked... I asked, right?

16:53.270 --> 16:54.171
Yeah, I asked.

16:54.790 --> 16:57.733
You, who would protect your smile better?

16:57.753 --> 16:59.915
Us or Donkey Kong?

17:00.095 --> 17:02.317
And then, you said Donkey Kong.

17:02.557 --> 17:03.818
Yeah.

17:03.838 --> 17:08.422
So I got a bit muffled by this, and I kinda mixed up my words.

17:08.522 --> 17:13.127
And I said, unfortunately, you're stuck here with us!

17:14.386 --> 17:17.969
We're stuck here with you!

17:18.009 --> 17:21.592
You messed it up again!

17:21.972 --> 17:22.432
See?

17:22.753 --> 17:25.195
Because I'm not feeling ruffled right now.

17:25.575 --> 17:29.138
So I messed it up and I said, unfortunately we're stuck here with you!

17:29.238 --> 17:30.519
It's another misunderstanding!

17:33.060 --> 17:33.860
Got it!

17:34.000 --> 17:36.221
Like, I don't want to be here with you!

17:36.241 --> 17:37.661
This is horrible.

17:37.721 --> 17:38.782
That's what I said.

17:38.842 --> 17:39.642
What did you say?

17:39.662 --> 17:42.603
Clear the misunderstanding for good this time!

17:42.623 --> 17:44.823
I said that we're stuck here with you!

17:44.843 --> 17:44.924
Yeah.

17:45.324 --> 17:48.205
But what I meant is that you're stuck here with us.

17:48.485 --> 17:48.705
Yeah.

17:49.825 --> 17:52.286
It's so... That doesn't sound like me, right?

17:52.706 --> 17:56.487
It doesn't sound like me to say something so... so horrible, right?

17:56.507 --> 18:00.569
It's a misunderstanding in the misunderstanding corner!

18:00.689 --> 18:08.111
But you know... You know... Luckily... I fixed it right away, because... You know, I know that that sort of thing happens.

18:09.052 --> 18:10.952
It happens with me all the time, right?

18:11.212 --> 18:13.233
Just like it did just now.

18:13.933 --> 18:18.255
But, you know... Understand, Ruffians, I say silly things like that...

18:18.955 --> 18:19.795
All the time.

18:19.895 --> 18:23.256
And you know, we really don't mean it when that happens.

18:23.296 --> 18:34.779
So, if we ever say something that you think is sort of like, oh, that really doesn't sound like FUWAMOCO would say or mean, then do understand that we probably got all jumbled up.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.719
And that's why we said something weird, okay?

18:37.439 --> 18:38.480
We didn't mean to.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.460
No, no.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.600
Right?

18:40.660 --> 18:41.180
It happens.

18:41.340 --> 18:41.961
All the time.

18:42.801 --> 18:44.661
You're the silly puppy, both of us.

18:44.841 --> 18:45.401
Why?

18:45.861 --> 18:47.202
We're both silly puppies.

18:47.222 --> 18:47.342
Why?

18:49.184 --> 18:50.545
I'm not evil!

18:50.826 --> 18:51.306
What?!

18:51.726 --> 18:53.668
They're saying I'm evil, Moco-chan.

18:53.949 --> 18:54.749
You're just silly.

18:55.050 --> 18:55.890
I'm just silly.

18:56.451 --> 18:58.173
We're both silly.

18:58.193 --> 19:00.695
You don't ever have this, Ruffians!

19:00.715 --> 19:03.498
It doesn't happen to you at all!

19:03.518 --> 19:06.040
That's the proper answer.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.662
No, you don't have this problem at all!

19:15.350 --> 19:16.091
Really?

19:16.511 --> 19:18.272
Maybe you should be sillier then, okay?

19:18.312 --> 19:20.293
Maybe it's a demon dog thing, Moco-chan.

19:20.673 --> 19:21.014
Maybe.

19:21.114 --> 19:22.655
Maybe they just don't understand.

19:22.675 --> 19:24.976
Well, now you understand, right?

19:24.996 --> 19:26.817
Because we cleared up the misunderstanding.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.338
Cleared up the misunderstanding.

19:29.759 --> 19:30.379
It's good.

19:30.559 --> 19:30.920
Good.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.481
Good, good, good.

19:32.901 --> 19:33.121
Good.

19:33.241 --> 19:34.542
No more misunderstanding.

19:34.562 --> 19:35.743
All done.

19:37.324 --> 19:39.405
We can breathe a little bit now.

19:40.163 --> 19:40.744
Not clear.

19:41.905 --> 19:43.667
I think that's your problem.

19:43.707 --> 19:44.769
That's your problem.

19:45.169 --> 19:46.230
Anyways!

19:47.031 --> 19:52.017
I had something I wanted to say.

19:52.037 --> 19:54.020
If it's okay.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.763
Is it okay, Ruffians?

19:59.586 --> 20:00.167
Is it okay?

20:07.383 --> 20:08.063
Today!

20:08.964 --> 20:10.845
You know, it's Wednesday.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.147
You're almost done with the week!

20:14.667 --> 20:16.848
But it can be really rough sometimes, right?

20:18.029 --> 20:18.489
So!

20:20.110 --> 20:21.170
Today!

20:22.151 --> 20:24.772
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

20:26.913 --> 20:29.515
And this time, you're gonna hear from me!

20:30.055 --> 20:31.075
Mococo, okay?

20:32.756 --> 20:33.297
You!

20:34.357 --> 20:35.458
You Ruffian!

20:37.239 --> 20:37.939
You did it!

20:38.499 --> 20:39.840
You got this far already!

20:39.860 --> 20:45.582
It's been tough, but... You might not have noticed it.

20:46.602 --> 20:47.562
But you're doing it!

20:48.043 --> 20:49.883
You're making through the day!

20:51.264 --> 20:54.085
Slowly, but surely, you're getting through this week.

20:54.725 --> 20:58.406
And even though you may stumble here and there, you're not letting it take you out.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.507
And that's what's important.

21:00.907 --> 21:01.247
Okay?

21:02.964 --> 21:04.726
You're amazing!

21:05.387 --> 21:05.987
And you know it.

21:06.568 --> 21:08.730
We're always here to cheer you on no matter what.

21:09.231 --> 21:14.316
So take risks, make mistakes, because you'll get stronger from it.

21:15.838 --> 21:16.298
Okay.

21:17.339 --> 21:19.341
We can do it all together.

21:20.563 --> 21:25.087
So today, go out there and make your place a good...

21:26.041 --> 21:26.261
World.

21:26.822 --> 21:27.202
Okay!

21:28.823 --> 21:29.744
Just remember!

21:30.265 --> 21:31.386
I believe in you!

21:31.406 --> 21:33.287
Fuwawa believes in you!

21:34.008 --> 21:34.949
It'll be okay!

21:35.649 --> 21:37.191
Let's be strong together, okay?

21:38.111 --> 21:38.472
Okay?

21:40.494 --> 21:42.395
Ganbatte ne!

21:42.655 --> 21:43.977
BAU BAU!

21:51.028 --> 21:52.269
BAU BAU!

21:52.329 --> 21:53.250
Thank you, Moco-chan!

21:53.690 --> 21:58.094
I need a bit of strength to get through the week, right?

21:58.134 --> 22:00.016
That's what we all need sometimes.

22:00.476 --> 22:02.198
Doggie of the Day!

22:03.059 --> 22:05.982
Who's a Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

22:09.224 --> 22:12.685
She has a lovely apricot!

22:13.185 --> 22:14.526
Look at that wing.

22:15.947 --> 22:21.409
She's such a pro at charming us.

22:21.489 --> 22:22.229
What about me?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.631
Is it the same?

22:34.964 --> 22:36.906
I can't be as cool as everybody.

22:36.946 --> 22:42.871
Moco-chan's winking, Apricot's winking, and I just... I kinda did it.

22:42.891 --> 22:43.771
How did you do it?

22:47.580 --> 22:50.221
Well, you know, I really like Apricot.

22:50.261 --> 22:50.801
Look!

22:50.821 --> 22:52.221
She's like Apricot color, too.

22:52.241 --> 22:53.622
Like an Apricot cookie.

22:53.862 --> 22:54.182
Right?

22:55.002 --> 22:56.503
She's fuzzy just like one, too.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.443
Yeah!

22:57.703 --> 22:58.763
You guys good friends.

22:58.843 --> 22:59.523
We're friends.

22:59.543 --> 23:01.104
We're linking friends.

23:01.564 --> 23:03.324
And you're both fuzzy, too.

23:04.865 --> 23:05.525
Ah, you know.

23:05.545 --> 23:11.027
And I love that we get to see her delicate little curls in the cool beans, too.

23:11.087 --> 23:12.527
Very cute.

23:12.607 --> 23:15.608
So cute and dainty, like a little princess.

23:15.748 --> 23:16.348
That's right.

23:16.388 --> 23:19.170
We're good friends.

23:19.570 --> 23:20.790
How do you think she BAU BAU?

23:21.351 --> 23:24.412
I think she's super polite, you know?

23:24.772 --> 23:29.655
She knows not to startle anyone with a big BAU BAU like Moco-chan and you do sometimes.

23:29.675 --> 23:33.176
No, I feel like her BAU BAU is sort of sharp.

23:33.616 --> 23:33.977
Sharp?

23:34.197 --> 23:34.897
BAU BAU!

23:35.497 --> 23:36.218
BAU BAU!

23:36.638 --> 23:39.479
I think it's more reserved like a BAU BAU!

23:40.039 --> 23:40.900
BAU BAU!

23:41.320 --> 23:41.980
BAU BAU!

23:42.460 --> 23:43.141
Like that.

23:43.621 --> 23:44.501
Like a princess.

23:45.161 --> 23:45.501
Yeah!

23:45.622 --> 23:47.462
A princess.

23:48.102 --> 23:57.504
Well, you know, I think what we can tell is that Apricot, she turns everyone with her lovely demeanor, and I think she's just a gem to be around, right?

23:57.524 --> 23:59.045
She sounds sort of familiar, huh?

24:00.905 --> 24:02.446
Sort of familiar, right?

24:02.806 --> 24:03.886
Yeah, but you know,

24:04.486 --> 24:08.388
She's pretty dainty, so I think you need to treat her very well.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.628
Like a princess.

24:09.669 --> 24:11.910
Her own pillow, her own blanket.

24:11.970 --> 24:13.850
Give her lots of hugs, okay?

24:13.870 --> 24:17.052
Princesses need lots of hugs.

24:17.712 --> 24:20.734
BAU BAU!

24:21.214 --> 24:23.715
Let's see where the Ruffians have been walking recently.

24:23.735 --> 24:25.616
Today I went on a walk where?

24:28.554 --> 24:31.515
It's speechless.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.496
This is real!

24:32.516 --> 24:34.776
Did you actually go here?

24:34.796 --> 24:37.017
Look at the sky, the beach.

24:37.497 --> 24:38.437
Wait, this is a photo.

24:38.457 --> 24:41.158
It's too beautiful.

24:41.178 --> 24:42.679
Moco-chan is taking a photo.

24:45.039 --> 24:48.083
I meant a painting, not a photo!

24:48.223 --> 24:50.545
It is a photo, yes!

24:51.166 --> 24:54.409
Wow, this is what the beach near you looks like!

24:54.769 --> 24:56.952
You can just walk to here whenever you want to!

24:58.314 --> 25:04.079
I think if it was that pretty, then I would be there for sunrise and sunset every day.

25:04.099 --> 25:07.161
You should go every day, right?

25:07.181 --> 25:09.423
You know, it kind of looks like a screensaver.

25:09.863 --> 25:12.265
One of those motivational posters.

25:12.405 --> 25:12.606
Right!

25:13.346 --> 25:16.469
What do you think the motivational text would be on it, Moco-chan?

25:17.089 --> 25:19.111
Ganbatte.

25:19.511 --> 25:20.792
That doesn't really get me.

25:20.812 --> 25:21.773
It gets me in the bones.

25:25.202 --> 25:26.283
What do you think you should be?

25:26.303 --> 25:29.407
Ruffians, what do you think the motivational piece should say?

25:30.869 --> 25:32.351
BAU BAU I'm at the beach.

25:34.854 --> 25:36.115
That's motivational.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.879
I think that's good enough.

25:38.899 --> 25:39.980
We can do better than that.

25:43.564 --> 25:44.665
Fight the Tides, BAU BAU.

25:44.705 --> 25:45.426
That's pretty good.

25:45.446 --> 25:46.186
That's pretty good.

25:46.206 --> 25:46.967
I like that one.

25:47.267 --> 25:48.929
BAU BAU and at the beach.

25:49.309 --> 25:50.210
It sort of rhymes.

25:50.370 --> 25:50.811
I don't know.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.212
BAU BAU is life.

25:52.813 --> 25:53.593
Beach is life.

25:53.713 --> 25:55.435
BAU BAU is life.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.876
BAU BAU at the beach.

25:56.896 --> 25:59.299
BAU BAU and carry on.

25:59.379 --> 26:02.602
Oh, that's good to hear.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.886
I'm really glad that you can enjoy such a beautiful beach so far.

26:06.906 --> 26:09.348
I feel like the water wouldn't smell at all.

26:10.585 --> 26:11.586
Not smelly water.

26:11.706 --> 26:12.266
Exactly.

26:12.286 --> 26:13.447
No wet dog smell.

26:13.507 --> 26:15.028
Exactly.

26:15.669 --> 26:17.410
Thank you so much!

26:17.491 --> 26:18.672
BAU BAU!

26:19.492 --> 26:22.875
And next, we have our Question of the Day!

26:22.995 --> 26:24.116
What is it?

26:24.156 --> 26:24.617
Let's see.

26:26.237 --> 26:30.700
Try to answer at the same time to see if you both are in sync.

26:31.361 --> 26:35.283
If dog is BAU BAU, cat is MAO MAO.

26:35.964 --> 26:38.546
Dog is GUA GUA.

26:38.966 --> 26:40.547
Rabbit is FAO FAO.

26:40.907 --> 26:43.929
It wasn't the same at all.

26:44.249 --> 26:45.390
What did you say?

26:45.430 --> 26:47.552
As cat is MAO MAO, CAO CAO.

26:48.427 --> 26:50.007
Duck is GAU GAU.

26:50.267 --> 26:50.967
GAU GAU.

26:51.408 --> 26:52.068
GAU GAU.

26:52.668 --> 26:53.868
Rabbit is FOW FOW.

26:53.908 --> 26:58.329
It's tough to say it all.

26:58.689 --> 27:01.449
See, cat is MOU MOU because cats go MEOW, right?

27:01.909 --> 27:09.971
And duck is GAU GAU because I feel like ducks go... Ducks go QUACK.

27:11.211 --> 27:15.592
And then the rabbit is fluffy so you take the F from the fluffy and then go FOW FOW.

27:16.715 --> 27:17.156
That's why.

27:17.336 --> 27:21.982
I think yours sound better than mine, but... What's the reasoning behind yours, Moco-chan?

27:22.143 --> 27:30.594
Cat starts with a C. And D starts with a D. D starts with a D, Moco-chan!

27:30.674 --> 27:31.275
What?

27:37.402 --> 27:38.162
It does!

27:38.322 --> 27:39.163
It does!

27:39.263 --> 27:44.244
It also ends with a D, too.

27:45.144 --> 27:46.584
I'm still asleep, okay?

27:46.764 --> 27:49.144
That's no good, Moco-chan.

27:49.184 --> 27:50.385
That's not acceptable.

27:50.445 --> 27:51.765
No misunderstandings.

27:52.025 --> 27:53.205
I said what I meant.

27:53.725 --> 27:54.685
And what's the last one?

27:54.725 --> 27:55.366
The rabbit?

27:55.706 --> 27:56.126
Rabbit.

27:56.206 --> 27:58.706
It starts with an R. So it's ROW ROW.

27:58.886 --> 27:59.526
It does.

27:59.546 --> 28:00.106
It does, too.

28:00.767 --> 28:01.347
I don't know.

28:01.407 --> 28:02.787
I don't feel like that's the one, though.

28:03.871 --> 28:05.473
Thank you for the unique questions!

28:05.513 --> 28:07.216
BAU BAU!

28:15.791 --> 28:18.752
Moco-chan, what game do we have coming up next?

28:18.872 --> 28:21.133
We have... De-den!

28:21.433 --> 28:24.234
We're playing River City Girls!

28:24.354 --> 28:25.274
BAU BAU BAU!

28:25.294 --> 28:28.576
I'm really excited, you know?

28:28.896 --> 28:31.177
We get to go back to River City Girls!

28:31.237 --> 28:34.858
We're gonna beat up a bunch of troublemakers, you know?

28:35.198 --> 28:38.739
Last time we were able to take down not just one Ruff, but two of them!

28:38.779 --> 28:39.880
We're improving!

28:40.000 --> 28:42.441
Yeah, I think that definitely means we're improving.

28:43.761 --> 28:46.023
It's really fun to kind of bow beside each other.

28:46.083 --> 28:49.205
Even though maybe sometimes Moco-chan punches me and I kick her.

28:49.585 --> 28:52.427
But I really like being able to use different moves.

28:52.888 --> 28:55.369
So I'm excited to see what awaits us!

28:55.449 --> 28:56.750
Right!

28:56.870 --> 28:58.832
Hopefully the bosses don't get too much stronger.

28:58.852 --> 29:00.953
That'll be good.

29:00.993 --> 29:01.674
That was tricky.

29:01.694 --> 29:03.855
We'll get stronger, so it'll be okay.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.918
I like the last lady with the dampanku.

29:06.938 --> 29:08.319
That was cool, right?

29:08.579 --> 29:10.380
I thought we were done for, but we did it!

29:12.645 --> 29:15.586
Well, let's have another quick peek at our schedule.

29:15.646 --> 29:16.226
De-den!

29:16.546 --> 29:18.747
This is our schedule this week!

29:19.347 --> 29:25.568
And on Friday, this time with Abbot, we're playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe!

29:25.608 --> 29:30.449
You know, I talked about how I feel like I'm pretty strong at Mario Kart, and you know why?

29:30.489 --> 29:34.170
Because I've played Mario Kart on mobile for quite a while.

29:34.830 --> 29:36.791
So I'm confident that I have at least

29:37.191 --> 29:42.513
A little bit of an advantage, but I don't know if that really transfers too much to Mario Kart 8.

29:42.553 --> 29:44.634
Ruffians, have you played it on mobile?

29:44.994 --> 29:46.994
Mario Kart... Something.

29:47.355 --> 29:47.935
Something.

29:47.955 --> 29:49.115
Mario Kart Drift?

29:49.695 --> 29:50.796
Mario Kart Tour?

29:50.836 --> 29:51.156
Tour?

29:51.196 --> 29:51.456
Tour?

29:51.496 --> 29:51.596
Tour?

29:51.616 --> 29:52.316
Tour?

29:53.016 --> 29:53.817
Yeah.

29:54.117 --> 29:57.078
So I kind of know, but it's different, you know?

29:57.398 --> 29:58.238
They're not the same.

29:59.138 --> 30:00.759
But the stages are the same.

30:01.239 --> 30:03.520
So then you kind of know, right?

30:04.099 --> 30:07.802
I really want to get strong, you know?

30:07.842 --> 30:20.492
I feel a bit silly because I think Mario Kart's a lot of just luck, but I'll try to learn, I'll try to practice, get more tips, and at least hopefully by a collab I can master how to be able to drift and do the super drifts.

30:20.532 --> 30:25.556
I could do it no problem before, but it's a bit different with a controller, you know?

30:26.076 --> 30:28.378
But Moco-chan, you're just playing for fun, right?

30:28.398 --> 30:29.138
I want to get good.

30:29.319 --> 30:30.139
You want to get good?

30:30.179 --> 30:30.359
Yeah.

30:32.984 --> 30:36.688
Well, we'll see who's the strongest in Abyss, okay?

30:36.908 --> 30:41.253
It'd be nice to beat Biboo for once, but I think Biboo plays quite a bit too, right?

30:41.313 --> 30:42.654
We'll see.

30:43.095 --> 30:49.181
Well, thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us for today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:49.862 --> 30:53.365
We hope you're powered up and ready to get through the rest of the week.

30:54.628 --> 30:56.369
Oh, I have one last thing I'd like to say.

30:56.689 --> 31:07.132
Just remember, Ruffians, unfortunately we won't be able to see you this evening, so we hope you have a really good time celebrating our senpai's mid-anniversary.

31:07.732 --> 31:08.213
Okay!

31:08.973 --> 31:16.455
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

31:16.475 --> 31:16.535

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

31:55.470 --> 31:58.310
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:58.330 --> 32:00.290
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

32:00.650 --> 32:03.211
BAU BAU!
