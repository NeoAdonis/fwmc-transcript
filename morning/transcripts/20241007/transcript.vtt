05:11.181 --> 05:14.383
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.643 --> 05:20.988
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:21.768 --> 05:24.610
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:25.151 --> 05:27.852
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.093 --> 05:30.514
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:32.888 --> 05:37.832
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.372 --> 05:41.835
Thank you for joining us today for our 132nd episode!

05:41.995 --> 05:46.598
Why is the 3 in front of the 2 the single 1, 2, 3, huh?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.031
We were just there and now it's going high.

05:53.371 --> 05:54.231
Right.

05:54.851 --> 05:57.852
BAU BAU!

05:58.352 --> 06:00.273
Ruffians, are you awake?

06:00.293 --> 06:00.933
Yeah!

06:01.374 --> 06:03.394
It's the beginning of a new week, so wake up!

06:03.754 --> 06:05.655
Wake up!

06:08.196 --> 06:10.837
Well, hopefully for those that are awake,

06:11.617 --> 06:15.619
And maybe those that are awake and joining us for the first time today.

06:15.639 --> 06:22.061

BAU BAU!

06:46.891 --> 06:49.152
Ruffians!

06:49.212 --> 06:51.072
Did I say Ruffians?

06:51.172 --> 06:52.853
What if I don't want to wake up?

06:55.768 --> 06:59.710
Ruffians that are awake but I thought it was the ones that are still asleep.

07:01.031 --> 07:03.393
They don't want to wake up right now.

07:03.973 --> 07:06.655
So how are you watching FUWAMOCO Morning?

07:06.695 --> 07:08.736
In your dreams?

07:09.336 --> 07:10.857
You want to go back to sleep?

07:11.918 --> 07:14.199
I don't know who works like that, Moco-chan.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.661
Ruffians.

07:17.942 --> 07:20.683
This is Mococo.

07:21.684 --> 07:22.585
In your dreams.

07:23.590 --> 07:26.372
Speaking directly to you.

07:26.392 --> 07:30.634
What are you going to do speaking directly to us like that, Moco-chan?

07:31.255 --> 07:32.295
Huh?

07:32.395 --> 07:36.358
What am I going to do?

07:36.578 --> 07:36.878
Huh?

07:37.058 --> 07:39.079
I will tell you.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.761
Use the hashtag.

07:41.861 --> 07:46.684
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

07:46.904 --> 07:49.605
Look at all these Ruffians up there.

07:50.126 --> 07:51.447
Subscribe to FUWAMOCO.

07:52.833 --> 07:57.716
FUWAMOCO Is this supposed to be hypnosis or something, Moco-chan?

07:57.796 --> 07:59.056
No, this is a dream.

08:00.717 --> 08:01.278
That's all.

08:01.558 --> 08:03.719
But the howl of a wolf is gonna wake up.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.401
I'm not in charge of that.

08:06.421 --> 08:07.641
That's not my place, okay?

08:08.001 --> 08:08.342
WAKE UP!

08:08.362 --> 08:08.822
WAKE UP!

08:08.882 --> 08:11.603
FUWAMOCO!

08:11.703 --> 08:14.245
FUWAMOCO!

08:14.605 --> 08:18.787
Last night I'm lighting off on the right paw, Moco-chan.

08:18.987 --> 08:19.648
Right?

08:19.668 --> 08:20.788
Ibaru!

08:20.828 --> 08:21.249
Yeah!

08:21.309 --> 08:21.409
And...

08:23.658 --> 08:24.878
Ruin that right paw.

08:25.498 --> 08:28.459
We have bad news.

08:28.959 --> 08:31.519
Why does it have to start like this every time, Moco-chan?

08:31.559 --> 08:35.480
Can't we just, like, not have bad news?

08:37.220 --> 08:38.041
Bad news.

08:41.161 --> 08:44.222
There's been... Pero Sighting.

08:45.102 --> 08:48.102
What about, like, a Pon-de-ring Sighting?

08:48.162 --> 08:49.083
That would be good!

08:49.183 --> 08:49.883
Why?

08:50.023 --> 08:51.123
But that's not what we get.

08:52.474 --> 08:54.435
The Ruffians and their Pero Sighting.

08:54.895 --> 08:55.355
Yeah.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.476
So we need to report on them.

08:57.496 --> 09:03.019
Let's take a look then.

09:03.059 --> 09:04.159
Well!

09:04.660 --> 09:08.701
Our Pero Sighting is... De-den!

09:08.861 --> 09:09.522
Garbage!

09:10.482 --> 09:15.184
All I see is garbage!

09:15.765 --> 09:18.046
How did Pero end up here, huh?

09:19.218 --> 09:20.979
Well, maybe.

09:21.739 --> 09:24.440
The garbage smelled a lot like some pudding, huh?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.020
Yeah?

09:25.220 --> 09:28.342
I don't know, have you ever smelled any pudding that smells like garbage?

09:28.402 --> 09:29.862
Or garbage that smells like pudding?

09:29.922 --> 09:30.643
Ruffians.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.743
Pudding that smells like garbage!

09:33.524 --> 09:35.765
I've smelled strawberries that smell like garbage.

09:35.845 --> 09:37.785
I've smelled pudding that smells like garbage.

09:38.506 --> 09:38.846
Not yet.

09:39.386 --> 09:41.327
But garbage that smells like pudding.

09:42.067 --> 09:42.487
Maybe.

09:43.528 --> 09:43.808
No.

09:46.694 --> 09:53.078
I don't know, maybe Pero finally got the message and that's why he decided to join the garbage.

09:53.458 --> 09:54.059
Maybe.

09:54.559 --> 09:55.780
What do you think, Ruffians?

09:57.401 --> 10:05.946
They push the button and come back to it.

10:05.986 --> 10:07.407
Push the button.

10:08.227 --> 10:09.008
Push.

10:09.348 --> 10:10.288
Press the button.

10:10.869 --> 10:11.589
BAU BAU!

10:14.539 --> 10:15.219
She wants it.

10:15.780 --> 10:16.721
Let's push it!

10:19.163 --> 10:19.803
Yeah!

10:19.903 --> 10:20.984
Yeah!

10:21.325 --> 10:21.925
Yeah!

10:22.025 --> 10:24.387
Let's push it!

10:24.727 --> 10:25.048
Yeah!

10:25.448 --> 10:34.296
But, Ruffians... I guess a Ruffian's a woman, but... It's not gonna do much, you know?

10:34.376 --> 10:35.837
It's not gonna do anything.

10:36.337 --> 10:36.918
Yeah...

10:37.791 --> 10:40.293
You know, you saw our 3D debut, right?

10:40.373 --> 10:40.753
Right!

10:40.813 --> 10:41.133
Yeah!

10:41.193 --> 10:46.757
You know, Pero is squishy and stretchy, so, uh, compacted.

10:47.377 --> 10:48.938
You're not really gonna do much to him.

10:49.038 --> 10:54.161
No, at the most, it'll just make a silly sound, but, uh... Yeah.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.823
You know.

10:57.804 --> 10:58.164
Yeah.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.240
Oh, that's gonna happen.

11:01.320 --> 11:01.881
I know!

11:02.321 --> 11:04.401
It's disappointing.

11:04.421 --> 11:05.922
No!

11:05.942 --> 11:05.982
No!

11:06.522 --> 11:07.062
Yeah.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.423
That's all that's gonna happen.

11:09.443 --> 11:10.564
Yeah.

11:10.684 --> 11:11.604
I guess that's okay.

11:11.864 --> 11:15.485
You know, it's probably in there for a good reason, right?

11:15.946 --> 11:16.146
Right!

11:16.186 --> 11:16.466
Yeah.

11:17.906 --> 11:18.927
We'll get them next time.

11:19.007 --> 11:19.967
I believe that.

11:20.467 --> 11:25.169
You know, there's a good reason, but... BAU BAU!

11:28.746 --> 11:30.469
It's good to know where he is.

11:30.749 --> 11:32.692
Always good to keep an eye out, okay?

11:32.752 --> 11:34.034
No, I'm kinda curious.

11:34.054 --> 11:38.841
I wanna go smell that garbage.

11:39.042 --> 11:43.188
Why don't you just smell pudding that smells like garbage instead?

11:43.228 --> 11:44.470
Why don't you just smell pudding?

11:46.225 --> 11:47.867
BAU BAU!

11:47.887 --> 11:49.768
FUWAMOCO fans!

11:49.908 --> 11:54.231
A new week has started, but there's a bunch of exciting things going on!

11:54.291 --> 11:57.454
Let's get sharing them with you right now!

11:57.834 --> 12:10.604
Well, just earlier yesterday, Advent's very own gem of emotion, Koseki Bijou, or Biboo, she released the

12:10.964 --> 12:14.848
Special music video for her first original song.

12:15.188 --> 12:18.812
Prism Magic or Prism no Mahou!

12:18.872 --> 12:20.793
BAU BAU!

12:20.834 --> 12:24.457
Congratulations Biboo!

12:24.517 --> 12:25.898
Congratulations!

12:25.938 --> 12:26.079
BAU!

12:26.119 --> 12:26.259
BAU!

12:26.279 --> 12:27.100
Did you see Ruffians?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.181
Did you watch?

12:28.681 --> 12:31.223
You know all the music is done by you, yeah?

12:31.704 --> 12:32.505
Amazing.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.005
And then the video!

12:34.046 --> 12:39.208
The art and the animation was all done by Yunarin and Mio!

12:39.628 --> 12:41.328
It's so amazing!

12:41.389 --> 12:42.809
And you haven't watched it!

12:42.949 --> 12:45.510
Oh, you need to go and watch!

12:45.670 --> 12:54.974
It just came out so... You're still in time, but in it you know you get to see a prism of different magical girls!

12:55.114 --> 12:56.555
Beautiful!

12:56.695 --> 12:57.115
So cute!

12:57.175 --> 12:57.935
And bright!

12:58.035 --> 12:59.516
And maybe there's a...

13:00.757 --> 13:02.318
Oh, yes!

13:02.398 --> 13:14.120
But you know, I saw some people saying it was like watching a whole season of a magical girl anime just summarized up into one perfect original song here!

13:14.160 --> 13:14.541
Yeah!

13:15.021 --> 13:17.821
Oh, you really like the lily of the valley design too, yeah!

13:17.841 --> 13:18.662
It's so cute!

13:18.702 --> 13:25.403
There's so many beautiful things with the animation, the illustrations, it fits so well with Biboo's song too!

13:25.503 --> 13:27.084
Very relaxing.

13:27.204 --> 13:27.724
Right!

13:28.904 --> 13:32.326
Yeah, seven seasons in one night!

13:32.366 --> 13:34.647
So please, please go check it out!

13:34.907 --> 13:36.047
And listen to it once too!

13:36.107 --> 13:40.069
I believe it will be on streaming services very soon!

13:40.870 --> 13:42.530
Full animation live!

13:43.010 --> 13:43.691
Right!

13:43.911 --> 13:45.452
Please, please go check it out!

13:45.832 --> 13:48.093
Support Biboo and listen to it once!

13:48.473 --> 13:54.115
As you know, maybe you can put it in a playlist together with Born to be BAU too!

13:56.156 --> 13:56.956
Please listen to our song!

13:57.016 --> 13:57.436
BAU BAU!

13:57.556 --> 13:59.257
Yeah!

13:59.277 --> 14:04.598
I wonder what Prism no Mahou and Born to be Baudel mashup would sound like, huh?

14:04.618 --> 14:08.219
Now I'm thinking about... Say my name.

14:09.019 --> 14:11.320
Say my name in baudel!

14:15.681 --> 14:21.522
N-E-R-I-S-S FUWAMOCO!

14:24.003 --> 14:24.983
Took you that long.

14:26.696 --> 14:28.817
I think you're thinking really hard there, huh?

14:29.477 --> 14:29.978
Yeah.

14:30.458 --> 14:37.782
It's one of those times when you need to think really, really hard, okay?

14:37.962 --> 14:40.583
I don't know, maybe the ultimate mashup.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.084
Kumikyoku.

14:42.444 --> 14:44.105
Prism No Mama.

14:44.525 --> 14:45.385
Born to be BAU.

14:45.405 --> 14:47.306
Don't say my name, right?

14:48.007 --> 14:48.647
Yeah.

14:48.807 --> 14:52.529
I don't know, that's a lot of different songs all together.

14:52.549 --> 14:54.270
I think it could be good.

14:55.681 --> 15:00.867
Please check it out over there!

15:01.447 --> 15:01.768
BAU BAU!

15:01.788 --> 15:02.288
F.U.W.A.M.O.C.O.

15:02.328 --> 15:03.950
BAU BAU!

15:14.901 --> 15:15.121
Ow!

15:15.642 --> 15:20.225
Hi Ruffians!

15:20.586 --> 15:26.030
It's a new week so we shared a new schedule with you just a little while ago.

15:26.070 --> 15:35.917
But on it, this week we're having our very first off collab together with a very special person.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.299
The amazing Suwapato!

15:44.718 --> 15:45.900
FUWAMOCO Morning!

15:56.785 --> 16:03.532
She's also an amazing ASMRtist, singer, and super cute demon king!

16:03.652 --> 16:06.055
And very very good game choice too!

16:06.135 --> 16:08.577
Finally!

16:08.897 --> 16:10.479
Finally!

16:10.499 --> 16:14.984
I'm watching her live ASMR right now!

16:15.164 --> 16:16.525
This is FUWAMOCO Morning.

16:18.988 --> 16:19.448
Yeah!

16:19.828 --> 16:22.090
Hatora-onee-san's so amazing!

16:22.110 --> 16:30.736
We really really admire her and you know, finally we get to have our first collab all together and an all collab too!

16:30.756 --> 16:38.622
So we're gonna be answering some questions, some marshmallows all together and chatting about a bunch of different things!

16:38.762 --> 16:46.888
Yeah and if you're curious about marshmallows, it's a service where you can ask us questions but in the waiting room for this stream, there is a link

16:47.228 --> 16:48.208
To the marshmallow box.

16:48.328 --> 16:55.511
It's not open yet, but it will be soon, so please feel free to ask questions, okay?

16:55.831 --> 17:01.874
I'm so excited, but I'm a little nervous too, right?

17:01.954 --> 17:09.657
But on this, I'm so cute, so... I see a lot of questions about a certain topic.

17:10.877 --> 17:13.599
Questions are for later, Ruffians!

17:14.099 --> 17:15.300
Not right now!

17:15.320 --> 17:16.821
Ask any questions, okay?

17:16.841 --> 17:17.161
Yeah.

17:17.281 --> 17:21.004
Can I ask a good question?

17:21.024 --> 17:23.546
Yes, you can ask a good question.

17:23.566 --> 17:30.350
FUWAMOCO will do her best to translate you, so... Use the way, okay, Ruffians?

17:30.590 --> 17:33.112
It's part of the thread, sister!

17:34.453 --> 17:37.475
We have a lot of sisters, Ruffians.

17:37.595 --> 17:39.077
How many sisters do we have?

17:39.157 --> 17:42.299
I've lost track.

17:42.499 --> 17:43.140
Sisters.

17:44.080 --> 17:50.005
Even in Spanish, unfortunately we cannot translate from Spanish to English to Japanese.

17:50.045 --> 17:51.366
That's a little bit difficult.

17:51.406 --> 17:54.048
Especially when we don't understand Spanish.

17:54.168 --> 17:58.311
Understand Spanish.

17:58.971 --> 17:59.452
Yeah.

18:00.132 --> 18:02.214
Understand Spanish.

18:03.942 --> 18:05.043
I don't understand this.

18:05.443 --> 18:09.025
BAU BAU!

18:09.045 --> 18:12.587
I hope that you'll join us in FUWAMOCO!

18:12.687 --> 18:13.707
BAU BAU!

18:15.579 --> 18:19.700
We have a lot of different streams coming up this week.

18:19.740 --> 18:23.382
The most exciting one is 7 Days to Dawn.

18:35.466 --> 18:35.887
FUWAMOCO Hi!

18:35.907 --> 18:39.630
FUWAMOCO Now you know our off call with Patreon is such a... FUWAMOCO But!

18:39.670 --> 18:44.295
FUWAMOCO But when we shared our schedule with you regionally, FUWAMOCO There's a ?

18:45.436 --> 18:46.377
FUWAMOCO Channel!

18:46.417 --> 18:54.865
FUWAMOCO And well, that's a very good reason because... FUWAMOCO Now we can share with you Ruffians!

18:55.946 --> 19:10.042
This upcoming weekend, FUWAMOCO will be participating in a special organized stream all organized by Mia-senpai called Houshou Marine Brain Battle.

19:15.550 --> 19:16.350
Dream called dog.

19:16.410 --> 19:17.250
How you doing?

19:17.691 --> 19:18.471
What does dog mean?

19:18.611 --> 19:19.751
Brain battle?

19:19.831 --> 19:21.531
Brain battle.

19:21.912 --> 19:31.714
As participants, we have to pretend to be a part of Mighty Senpai's brain and battle it out together to solve some of her very deep worries and concerns.

19:31.814 --> 19:33.034
Sounds silly.

19:33.474 --> 19:35.155
No, this is very serious.

19:35.815 --> 19:37.736
It's solving for constraints.

19:37.836 --> 19:44.118
Yeah, you know, it's like multiple parts of our mind are all coming together to solve the problem kind of thing, you know?

19:44.158 --> 19:44.878
Like that!

19:44.898 --> 19:45.599
Good stuff!

19:45.799 --> 19:57.943
So, you know, FUWAMOCO, we have to make sure we do a convincing job of proving that we are actually minding the brain, otherwise we'll be found and voted out of the brain.

19:59.215 --> 20:10.364
Fubuki-senpai, Subaru-senpai, Miyu-senpai, Okayu-senpai, and others will also be participating!

20:10.384 --> 20:12.686
What do you think, Ruffians?

20:12.706 --> 20:20.372
Do you think we'll be able to do a good impersonation of Marine-senchou-senpai?

20:22.752 --> 20:24.272
I kinda hope we get it together.

20:24.292 --> 20:25.773
Kinda like Inside Out.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.553
I think that's kinda the idea.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.253
Although I don't really know what that movie is.

20:30.273 --> 20:30.313
No.

20:32.794 --> 20:34.414
Yeah, Fuwawa could do it!

20:34.854 --> 20:38.135
BAU BAU!

20:38.215 --> 20:41.455
I'm not gonna share my impersonation right now.

20:41.475 --> 20:43.216
Because that would be a little bit of a spoiler.

20:43.236 --> 20:45.796
And it's probably really, really bad right now.

20:45.816 --> 20:47.396
Right, Moco-chan?

20:47.416 --> 20:49.217
You don't understand Spanish?

20:49.257 --> 20:50.957
I don't understand Spanish.

20:53.658 --> 20:58.982
Miya-senpai said that it was about 2 or 3 years in the works.

21:01.105 --> 21:12.917
We're really really excited to be a part and you know, hopefully we can show just how fluffy and fuzzy that this part of Marine-senchou-senpai's brain is.

21:15.639 --> 21:22.386
We're gonna have a bunch of fun and we're also gonna do our best as the sole members of hololive English.

21:24.308 --> 21:26.509
We're gonna do our best!

21:26.549 --> 21:27.690
We're gonna do our best!

21:27.730 --> 21:28.010
BAU BAU!

21:45.913 --> 21:48.695
FUWAMOCO's impersonation will be legendary!

21:48.715 --> 21:53.538
BAU BAU!

21:54.098 --> 21:58.982
Mococo's voice sounds exactly like mine, Senchou-senpai!

21:59.022 --> 22:02.824
So happy that it seems like everybody's rooting for me!

22:03.464 --> 22:03.745
BAU BAU!

22:03.825 --> 22:08.948
I'm sure Moco-chan will do amazing!

22:09.803 --> 22:10.404
I'll do my best.

22:10.885 --> 22:12.387
I'll do my best too!

22:12.788 --> 22:14.590
BAU BAU!

22:15.091 --> 22:16.433
BAU BAU!

22:16.493 --> 22:17.114
Ruffians!

22:17.174 --> 22:20.299
Something surprising showed up in our mailbox.

22:20.539 --> 22:21.480
Summer is over.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.163
It's over.

22:23.664 --> 22:25.707
A really really big box.

22:28.545 --> 22:29.225
We opened it.

22:30.106 --> 22:36.730
It turned out it was our prizes from the Holosummer Bingo!

22:36.790 --> 22:37.291
Yeah!

22:37.311 --> 22:41.093
FUWAMOCO, we worked really hard at the Holosummer Bingo.

22:41.173 --> 22:46.676
We filled up both the regular bingo sheet and the infernal bingo sheet.

22:46.736 --> 22:49.898
Both each 100% clear.

22:50.959 --> 22:53.321
Thank you.

22:53.361 --> 22:53.921
Consolation.

22:56.941 --> 22:58.322
Yeah!

22:58.362 --> 23:01.064
Let's take a look at what we received!

23:03.045 --> 23:03.205
Oh!

23:03.286 --> 23:05.607
What is this?

23:05.647 --> 23:06.848
FUWAMOCO!

23:06.868 --> 23:11.311
A consolation prize with something actually really really nice!

23:11.691 --> 23:13.212
Some Megarhythm!

23:13.392 --> 23:16.874
A Megarhythm makes a lot of really nice relaxing products.

23:17.015 --> 23:18.155
Got earmuffs!

23:18.195 --> 23:20.717
We got some hot earmuffs to put on her.

23:20.948 --> 23:25.250
Tired eyes at the end of the day. And we really like using those usually!

23:25.470 --> 23:38.777
We actually just ordered a bunch more so it's a little bit interesting timing. But we also got some nice shoulder heating patches too. And some nice bath salts too!

23:39.097 --> 23:40.938
Lit cooling pads!

23:41.539 --> 23:44.900
And well, of the Megarithms, we have over 100 of each!

23:47.234 --> 23:48.256
We have a lot!

23:48.656 --> 23:50.259
We have a lot, a lot, a lot.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.022
A lot, a lot, a lot.

23:52.363 --> 23:55.749
Cuz it was one month for each of us.

23:56.660 --> 23:57.621
Fuwamon store.

23:58.101 --> 23:58.461
Wow.

23:59.522 --> 24:00.442
It's a lot.

24:00.462 --> 24:01.463
A big box!

24:01.723 --> 24:05.445
So, FUWAMOCO is going to be relaxing quite a bit.

24:05.905 --> 24:06.766
That would be nice.

24:06.826 --> 24:10.868
And there's so many nice baths we can have.

24:10.908 --> 24:16.811
We got a really huge thing of fancy bath salts times two.

24:16.871 --> 24:19.173
But what is the food there, huh?

24:19.653 --> 24:21.214
Yeah, wow.

24:21.534 --> 24:22.815
Also, we're surprised.

24:23.695 --> 24:30.957
So Kanata-senpai, she won a year's supply of big katsu, which is like a katsu snack.

24:30.977 --> 24:32.218
A little dagashi.

24:32.358 --> 24:34.359
Yeah, but a year's supply?

24:34.439 --> 24:35.439
A year's supply.

24:35.479 --> 24:36.279
That's a lot!

24:36.659 --> 24:39.760
So Kanata-senpai decided that she'd share!

24:39.820 --> 24:41.361
She's gonna share it!

24:41.401 --> 24:45.002
So we got a whole bunch of big katsu too!

24:45.562 --> 24:46.823
A whole bunch!

24:46.943 --> 24:47.563
Yeah!

24:47.583 --> 24:51.004
I don't know if we can... Can we eat the whole guy?

24:51.304 --> 24:51.644
Right.

24:51.844 --> 24:53.345
At first I thought they were fast.

24:54.539 --> 24:58.783
Big katsu.

24:58.883 --> 25:07.050
Big katsu is good too, but bad lettuce and big katsu are a bit different, you know?

25:07.470 --> 25:09.852
One fills my tummy, the other fills my heart.

25:09.872 --> 25:13.695
But now we have lots of goodies!

25:14.235 --> 25:19.620
And we can relax with our eye masks in the bathtub while eating big katsu!

25:19.800 --> 25:20.581
Exactly!

25:20.621 --> 25:22.082
Yeah, you know.

25:27.498 --> 25:29.940
FUWAMOCO Have you tried eating a foul-littered door?

25:30.060 --> 25:30.860
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:30.880 --> 25:31.881
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:31.901 --> 25:33.021
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:33.081 --> 25:33.522
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:33.682 --> 25:34.783
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:34.803 --> 25:35.163
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:35.183 --> 25:36.063
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:36.083 --> 25:36.724
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:36.744 --> 25:38.765
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.185
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:39.205 --> 25:40.186
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:40.286 --> 25:41.527
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:41.567 --> 25:42.567
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:42.587 --> 25:42.928
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:42.948 --> 25:43.868
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:43.888 --> 25:44.248
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:44.308 --> 25:45.549
Moco-chan sneezed on a few for sure.

25:45.569 --> 25:45.909
FUWAMOCO I didn't!

25:45.929 --> 25:46.770
Moco-chan sneezed on a

25:47.332 --> 25:51.374
Yeah, I don't know about eating a big katsu in the bathtub but maybe- KAKIGORI!

25:51.995 --> 25:52.295
Yes.

25:53.055 --> 25:57.158
Maybe you could eat the big katsu while like hanging out the outside of the bathtub!

26:03.093 --> 26:03.793
Nice baths.

26:04.234 --> 26:05.114
Relaxation.

26:05.374 --> 26:08.255
And big cuddles and waiters in the future.

26:08.936 --> 26:13.598
BAU BAU!

26:13.698 --> 26:16.499
We're so lucky huh?

26:16.579 --> 26:17.760
We're Ruffians.

26:18.420 --> 26:18.880
Actually.

26:20.401 --> 26:22.422
We thought we surprised you Ruffians.

26:22.882 --> 26:23.903
FUWAMOCO!

26:23.963 --> 26:26.624
We have a big announcement!

26:26.684 --> 26:28.185
BAU BAU!

26:30.537 --> 26:33.600
Oh, a big announcement in FUWAMOCO Morning!

26:33.960 --> 26:36.082
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

26:36.102 --> 26:37.663
Ruffians!

26:38.004 --> 26:39.825
It finally happened!

26:40.246 --> 26:44.369
Something that you've been looking forward to for a long time.

26:44.589 --> 26:48.373
Which Ruffians, you know what the thing you've been looking forward to for a long time is, huh?

26:48.533 --> 26:52.516
Mococo Hinata!

26:53.963 --> 26:55.125
Doggycon!

26:59.070 --> 26:59.751
Doggycon!

27:00.672 --> 27:04.536
That makes me happy though.

27:05.598 --> 27:05.798
Oh!

27:06.058 --> 27:06.959
New outfit!

27:08.922 --> 27:09.382
Balls!

27:09.703 --> 27:10.163
Balls!

27:10.604 --> 27:11.065
Balls!

27:16.253 --> 27:21.694
We got FUWAMOCO!

27:21.714 --> 27:24.555
We got FUWAMOCO!

27:24.675 --> 27:26.656
FUWAMOCO!

27:27.076 --> 27:29.677
It's taking us a little while, you know.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.578
Very busy demon doors.

27:31.598 --> 27:40.260
But we finally were able to find exactly the FUWAMOCO that we were searching for all day!

27:40.420 --> 27:42.001
You know, Ruffians do that.

27:42.441 --> 27:45.463
FUWAMOCO's having a little bit of a hard time finding bowls.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.464
We went to many different places.

27:47.484 --> 27:48.725
We asked, do you have bowls?

27:49.145 --> 27:50.706
And they'd be like, oh the bowls are this way.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.047
And they're little voice bowls.

27:52.127 --> 27:53.848
No, I don't want ocha one!

27:54.048 --> 27:54.328
No!

27:54.348 --> 27:59.812
We're looking for big bowls that can hold soup and vegetables and big things.

27:59.932 --> 28:00.312
Stuff.

28:00.652 --> 28:01.092
Yeah.

28:02.153 --> 28:04.574
I know they'd also take us to the balls section.

28:04.814 --> 28:06.674
No, I don't want a ball!

28:06.874 --> 28:09.295
I want a pool!

28:09.895 --> 28:12.955
But the balls we got, they're perfect!

28:13.536 --> 28:14.936
Good size!

28:14.956 --> 28:19.977
They're nice, they're kind of white, but not like hospital white.

28:20.017 --> 28:22.698
They're nice and they're cute.

28:22.738 --> 28:23.658
And simple.

28:23.858 --> 28:27.039
Most importantly, they can hold lots of soup!

28:29.813 --> 28:30.754
I think we're ready.

28:30.814 --> 28:31.715
We got two.

28:32.295 --> 28:32.736
We got two.

28:32.756 --> 28:33.436
Perfect amount.

28:33.696 --> 28:35.658
Moco-chan, you're not gonna drop yours, right?

28:36.418 --> 28:38.460
Actually, I was worried about dropping.

28:38.860 --> 28:39.521
Please do not.

28:39.581 --> 28:40.702
Please do not.

28:41.682 --> 28:45.125
I guess if you drop it though, we could just order another one.

28:45.145 --> 28:45.365
True.

28:45.946 --> 28:47.807
But thank you so much, Ruffians!

28:47.907 --> 28:49.568
Thank you!

28:49.588 --> 28:51.510
Now we can finally have soup!

28:52.050 --> 28:52.391
Yes!

28:53.411 --> 28:53.652
Soup!

28:56.800 --> 28:58.382
Oh my!

28:58.602 --> 29:03.385
And we also got a nice big pot to cook the soup in!

29:03.866 --> 29:06.668
We're now very excited!

29:06.688 --> 29:11.171
Especially with all the yummy ingredients there are!

29:11.231 --> 29:12.813
The four vegetables!

29:14.222 --> 29:15.144
BAU BAU!

29:15.284 --> 29:17.007
Yes, huge achievement!

29:17.107 --> 29:20.052
Very much a huge achievement!

29:20.152 --> 29:21.715
Did we surprise you, Ruffians?

29:23.679 --> 29:25.221
With our big announcement!

29:26.063 --> 29:27.385
I think head pats are in order.

29:27.806 --> 29:29.309
Yes, they are.

29:29.349 --> 29:29.990
BAU BAU!

29:30.090 --> 29:33.095
It's a good day!

29:33.396 --> 29:35.900
Yeah, a good way to start off the week.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.741
BAU BAU!

29:39.761 --> 29:42.803
Again, thank you Ruffians for the help!

29:43.024 --> 29:45.106
Let's not look at balls so much longer.

29:45.186 --> 29:47.608
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

29:48.769 --> 29:51.512
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

29:53.290 --> 29:54.951
Lady!

29:57.852 --> 30:01.934
Look how comfy we are!

30:01.954 --> 30:03.014
Look at that paw.

30:03.314 --> 30:06.916
Kinda looks like it's just about ready to fall off there, huh?

30:07.456 --> 30:08.337
It's dangling!

30:08.497 --> 30:11.918
Yeah, she's just so relaxed.

30:13.839 --> 30:18.621
I just wanna crawl up there with lady.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.381
FUWAMOCO-CHAN WE GOT IT!

30:26.801 --> 30:29.003
How does lady BAU BAU, huh?

30:29.564 --> 30:32.266
Maybe it's sort of... BAU BAU.

30:33.427 --> 30:34.448
BAU BAU.

30:36.009 --> 30:36.890
BAU BAU.

30:36.990 --> 30:40.112
I should not notice Moco-chan when you're having a good dream.

30:40.132 --> 30:42.794
Maybe.

30:42.814 --> 30:44.776
BAU BAU!

30:44.856 --> 30:46.457
BAU BAU!

30:46.718 --> 30:50.561
By the way, lady is super cute and also very neat.

30:52.135 --> 30:56.659
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

30:56.740 --> 30:57.801
Have a howl of a day!

30:57.841 --> 30:59.923
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

31:00.703 --> 31:02.005
Have a howl of a day!

31:13.498 --> 31:15.879
That doesn't sound like a problem to us, you know?

31:16.059 --> 31:16.599
And you know what?

31:16.619 --> 31:18.680
We're gonna give lady lots of pets too!

31:19.120 --> 31:20.460
So it sounds like a win-win!

31:20.520 --> 31:21.860
Win-win!

31:22.341 --> 31:25.701
BAU BAU!

31:25.721 --> 31:27.182
BAU BAU!

31:27.262 --> 31:28.822
Very cute lady.

31:28.842 --> 31:29.463
Wow!

31:29.523 --> 31:30.563
Ruffians!

31:30.843 --> 31:33.644
Let's see where you've been going for walks recently, huh?

31:34.977 --> 31:36.677
The day I went on a walk.

31:36.858 --> 31:39.398
We have De-den!

31:39.778 --> 31:42.559
What a nice morning!

31:42.839 --> 31:48.701
Yeah, a beautiful sunset at the end of what sounds like it was a super fun day.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.821
So nice!

31:51.281 --> 31:56.463
We're really glad you know that you had a good time and go out and about there.

31:58.048 --> 32:05.091
I feel like we're always so super lucky when we see a particularly beautiful sunrise or sunset.

32:05.251 --> 32:07.893
It makes us feel so thankful for every day.

32:08.573 --> 32:10.894
This is a really good one, huh?

32:12.275 --> 32:20.799
I hope Ruffians that maybe the right sunset or sunrise will be beautiful just like this for you too.

32:20.879 --> 32:22.600
Please take a moment for it, okay?

32:23.860 --> 32:26.502
BAU BAU!

32:26.522 --> 32:27.043
Thank you!

32:27.763 --> 32:31.006
And next we have our Question of the Day!

32:31.086 --> 32:34.409
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

32:34.669 --> 32:36.251
Hello FUWAMOCO!

32:36.311 --> 32:37.051
Hello!

32:37.191 --> 32:38.312
I have a question.

32:38.592 --> 32:41.455
Pero is, like we know, a bit nasty.

32:41.915 --> 32:44.257
But why did you decide to keep him as a pet?

32:44.758 --> 32:45.618
BAU BAU!

32:45.859 --> 32:46.899
BAU BAU!

32:46.919 --> 32:49.041
This is a good question!

32:49.281 --> 32:51.183
Ruffians, have you wondered this too?

32:52.688 --> 32:56.610
You know, Pero, he's a pain.

32:56.630 --> 32:59.351
He can say some nasty things, right?

32:59.472 --> 33:00.472
A lot, yeah.

33:00.552 --> 33:04.674
Yeah, and he can kinda be a bit scary towards the Ruffians, too.

33:04.694 --> 33:07.716
There's been some close calls, huh?

33:08.336 --> 33:10.437
Yeah, but, uh, you know!

33:10.917 --> 33:12.778
He's Papa Puppy's friend!

33:12.818 --> 33:18.401
Yeah, and, I mean, he didn't teach us a lot many dog years ago.

33:18.641 --> 33:19.122
Yeah.

33:20.582 --> 33:25.286
But you know, now he has no more new tricks to teach us.

33:25.306 --> 33:26.127
Yeah.

33:27.728 --> 33:30.890
He's just the old demon dog, you know?

33:31.331 --> 33:34.954
Yeah, but he still doesn't go away.

33:35.774 --> 33:40.378
So, just kind of make him our pet now, right?

33:40.418 --> 33:40.698
Yeah!

33:40.818 --> 33:42.920
And you know, sometimes he does help out.

33:43.441 --> 33:46.943
You know, like getting us wifi and cell and stuff.

33:46.963 --> 33:48.024
Yeah, that was day four.

33:49.549 --> 33:52.212
Most of the time deshita is nasty.

33:55.414 --> 33:57.657
BAU BAU!

33:57.677 --> 34:06.685
Thank you Ruffians for your questions, your books, for sending us your doggies, and also your Pero Sightings.

34:06.805 --> 34:15.393
Ruffians, we are always looking for more submissions so please, you know, we're so happy to have you here being a part of FUWAMOCO.

34:15.493 --> 34:16.113
FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:16.413 --> 34:20.374
But if you want to, it can be an even better part.

34:20.414 --> 34:21.695
Just use the hashtag.

34:22.015 --> 34:24.455
Hashtag FWMCMorning.

34:24.815 --> 34:30.057
And send us your Doggie of the Day, your questions, your looks, and your Pero Sightings.

34:30.097 --> 34:32.017
We're waiting, okay?

34:32.437 --> 34:34.638
BAU BAU!

34:35.138 --> 34:38.719
Well, we have another stream coming up relatively soon.

34:38.739 --> 34:40.760
Let's take a look at what it is.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.460
We have...

34:42.291 --> 34:43.672
Paratopic.

34:43.692 --> 34:48.055
It's a horror evening, we're gonna be playing Paratopic.

34:48.416 --> 34:52.419
It's a 3D retro horror game.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.060
It looks scary!

34:54.140 --> 34:55.481
Yeah, right!

34:55.501 --> 34:58.584
I don't know what it's about.

34:59.344 --> 34:59.684
Yeah.

35:00.525 --> 35:00.705
Ah!

35:00.765 --> 35:01.546
The pixels!

35:01.866 --> 35:02.266
No!

35:03.127 --> 35:03.287
Ah!

35:03.327 --> 35:04.428
The pixels!

35:05.189 --> 35:05.669
Pixels!

35:05.749 --> 35:08.371
It's kinda, yeah, it's quite a face.

35:08.471 --> 35:09.312
It's quite a face.

35:10.104 --> 35:11.364
Yeah.

35:11.644 --> 35:14.465
Does he look after a 12 hour shift?

35:15.505 --> 35:15.945
No.

35:16.446 --> 35:17.566
Be kind to yourself.

35:18.026 --> 35:21.967
He looks much, much, much, much more frightened.

35:23.307 --> 35:25.688
I don't know if he's a little frightened.

35:25.708 --> 35:28.148
Maybe after a 12 hour shift.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.829
Oh, that makes sense.

35:29.849 --> 35:30.249
Yeah.

35:31.449 --> 35:32.209
Anybody will be.

35:32.289 --> 35:32.430
Yeah.

35:34.978 --> 35:42.585
Let me get into bed, you know I'm tired!

35:42.705 --> 35:47.570
I'm a little bit scared but also excited because...

35:51.482 --> 35:53.084
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

35:53.124 --> 35:53.985
Have a howl of a day!

36:05.447 --> 36:06.547
BAU BAU!

36:06.787 --> 36:07.868
BAU BAU!

36:08.188 --> 36:09.728
It's my schedule!

36:09.788 --> 36:12.889
Well, Pero Talk, it might be one of the first horror games ever.

36:12.909 --> 36:13.789
But it's not the first!

36:14.169 --> 36:18.291
No, because we're continuing with 7 Days to Die!

36:18.311 --> 36:26.093
A big big project project game that we're all playing together with hololive English for this next 7 days.

36:26.753 --> 36:27.933
It says 7 days to die.

36:27.953 --> 36:33.095
Like you have 7 days within those days to die, but what about 7 days to survive?

36:33.355 --> 36:33.655
Huh?

36:34.315 --> 36:34.675
Right!

36:34.915 --> 36:35.476
We don't know.

36:36.656 --> 36:37.617
I'm looking forward to it.

36:37.657 --> 36:39.858
It's going to be our first time playing it!

36:40.239 --> 36:43.460
And more than anything, together with all our senpais!

36:43.641 --> 36:45.402
Our Iriankohai, too!

36:45.602 --> 36:47.563
It's going to be a lot of fun!

36:47.603 --> 36:51.445
Yeah, and you know, I'm sure we'll get to know each other very, very much.

36:51.465 --> 36:52.726
Nice and close.

36:53.326 --> 36:55.327
Especially since, you know, we're surviving together.

36:55.368 --> 36:57.249
Things might get a little bit rough.

36:57.289 --> 36:58.689
A little bit... gross.

36:59.910 --> 37:01.471
Don't be sorry.

37:01.591 --> 37:02.592
Why?

37:02.812 --> 37:02.952
Yeah.

37:03.643 --> 37:05.326
But we're gonna do our best!

37:05.586 --> 37:10.333
And then, you know we have our off collab together with Patraresa.

37:10.814 --> 37:15.341
And we also have Marin's brain...brain?

37:15.901 --> 37:16.442
Battle.

37:16.522 --> 37:17.844
Battle is right!

37:18.505 --> 37:21.910
And on Sunday too, we have a members only stream!

37:21.950 --> 37:25.234
We're gonna be playing Fall Guys together with the Doggy Pack!

37:25.474 --> 37:28.899
So if you haven't played before, please go and download Fall Guys!

37:29.259 --> 37:30.080
It is free!

37:30.120 --> 37:31.402
It's super fun!

37:31.762 --> 37:34.746
And we might be able to play all together too!

37:34.766 --> 37:36.689
I hope that's the week!

37:37.269 --> 37:38.990
I'm up next here.

37:39.530 --> 37:42.191
Thank you so much for joining us, Ruffians!

37:42.251 --> 37:45.513
We hope to have an even more fun week together!

37:45.893 --> 37:51.916
For Ruffians who are joining us through the archive today too, here is your FUWAMOCODEword!

37:52.436 --> 37:55.317

38:10.118 --> 38:14.421
Thank you for joining us today for this FUWAMOCO Morning!

38:14.961 --> 38:16.282
It's not starting, it's ending.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.863
It's over.

38:18.303 --> 38:25.788
But before we say bau bau for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

38:26.329 --> 38:27.249

38:27.569 --> 38:29.230

39:03.489 --> 39:11.493
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

39:11.513 --> 39:14.775
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
