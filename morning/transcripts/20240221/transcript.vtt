00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.635
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:10.582
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.125
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:22.168
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:25.070
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.092
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:29.934
BAU BAU!

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:35.758
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.359
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.822
It's the 83rd FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:46.385
Thank you for having us as a part of your morning.

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:49.126
Wow, we feel really lucky.

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:51.288
Especially so today.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.910
BAU BAU!

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:06.076
Wow, for any Ruffians joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:06.496
A.K.A.

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:07.937
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:11.960
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.423
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:18.643 --> 00:06:21.544
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:23.925
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:28.047
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:30.748
BAU BAU!

00:06:33.464 --> 00:06:38.205
Ruffians, I don't know if that's supposed to be the part where you get excited about.

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:40.945
BAU BAU.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.566
I'm happy to see you excited though.

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:43.746
Yeah!

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.866
It's good to be excited in the morning.

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:50.227
There's another amazing day waiting for us, Ruffians!

00:06:50.527 --> 00:06:52.487
So let's do our best today too.

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.928
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:58.188
What's been going on for FUWAMOCO?

00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:00.389
What do you have this FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:07:03.143 --> 00:07:05.724
Maybe this isn't as exciting.

00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:06.264
Huh?

00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:08.225
Exciting?

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:09.325
Not exciting?

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:10.385
Which one is it?

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:14.006
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:17.707
Well!

00:07:18.748 --> 00:07:20.328
Where's Pero this time, huh?

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:21.909
Let's see!

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:23.889
De-den!

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:25.530
Oh!

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.250
This is cute!

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:29.731
But... Pero...

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:36.714
You say he's making friends, but... Are you sure?

00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:39.715
Are you supervising them?

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:48.659
I don't know what... If you don't, things could get very ugly very quick.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.081
But, you know, your life is busy too.

00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:57.682
You don't have all day to watch over them and see that nothing weird happens.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:02.978
I have an idea.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:03.580
Well...

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.761
Some very cute plushies there.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:16.286
Why don't you make sure to add two Ruffian plushies to your household as well?

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:21.068
That way, they can help guard over and monitor the situation for you.

00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:22.369
Good idea!

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:22.969
Right?

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.834
You know, Ruffians, you can still add more Ruffian plushies to your army right now, so don't forget!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:31.654
Don't forget!

00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:33.927
We can't forget.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:34.927
We can't forget!

00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:37.328
If you want an army, now is the chance!

00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:39.449
Ruffian army.

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:40.809
Ima shika nai!

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:46.190
You know, I really like how they're peeking around the door at you.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.190
Even Pero?

00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:48.811
It's cute.

00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:50.131
Even Pero maybe.

00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:57.493
Well, I hope everything works out and you know, that you have fun with the company there too.

00:08:58.113 --> 00:08:59.273
BAU BAU!

00:09:01.514 --> 00:09:02.435
Yeah.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.777
Pero meets Takodachi.

00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:05.497
I know.

00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:07.519
Hopefully everything will be okay.

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.201
It'll be a nice meeting, huh?

00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:09.841
Yeah.

00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:10.662
For sure!

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:11.062
Yeah.

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:12.844
BAU BAU.

00:09:12.944 --> 00:09:13.404
BAU BAU!

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:16.247
Ruffians!

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:28.557
In just a few weeks, hololive Expo 2024 and FIFTH FES capture the moment will be happening in Tokyo at Makuhari Messe!

00:09:28.597 --> 00:09:29.077
BAU BAU!

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.043
We're very excited.

00:09:35.063 --> 00:09:47.634
There's even more exciting news coming out right now.

00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:51.658
You might know, but Expo is like a big party, right?

00:09:51.818 --> 00:09:52.618
Big party, yeah.

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:59.792
What's a party without some food and drinks?

00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:01.834
BAU BAU!

00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.816
Dance food!

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:07.999
And also, this year's theme, hololive Foods and Beverages, were just announced.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.201
And among that lineup is...

00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:18.030
I'm FUWAMOCO Drink!

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:19.051
BAU BAU!

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.752
I'm FUWAMOCO Drink, what do you think, Ruffians?

00:10:22.472 --> 00:10:28.415
To explain a little bit about it, it's a white soda based drink featuring us!

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:31.797
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:34.598
Mio-senpai did a taste test of...

00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:49.925
FUWAMOCO Milk!

00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:50.827
It's a white soda Ruffian.

00:10:50.847 --> 00:10:51.527
White soda!

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:14.131
Okay, but you know Mio-senpai also came up with a cat copy for it.

00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:20.334
And it was something like, you might drown in their fluffy and fuzzy cream.

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:27.076
It's so busy that you'll BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:30.378
I'm glad that Mio-senpai enjoyed it.

00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:32.659
You know, if you get it at Expo as well!

00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:39.354
It'll also come with a special themed coaster and printed signature from our snow!

00:11:39.774 --> 00:11:42.236
If you get tasty, we love it!

00:11:42.316 --> 00:11:45.077
If you wanna choose, our special FUWAMOCO drink!

00:11:45.297 --> 00:11:47.258
BAU BAU!

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:52.681
I don't know, I think this sounds a little bit better than the Fuwa Water.

00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:52.882
Why?

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.046
It's a white soda, Ruffians.

00:11:58.807 --> 00:11:59.488
Use your brain.

00:11:59.528 --> 00:12:01.069
Like a whipped cream on top.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.891
And the sprinkles, too.

00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:04.432
Right!

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:06.433
It's not complete without the sprinkles.

00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:12.498
And the coaster, too!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.080
I'm excited.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.282
Nomitai deshita!

00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:19.924
Liquid Pero-Pero's not included.

00:12:19.984 --> 00:12:20.205
No.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.887
It's the FUWAMOCO drink, not the Pero drink.

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.349
That would be terrifying.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.002
I did not think about that.

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:41.112
Ruffians, earlier this morning, FUWAMOCO, we were up early because we had a collab with Choco-senpai!

00:12:42.574 --> 00:12:45.676
Choco-senbin, Choco-sen.

00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:47.918
She took our measurements and I...

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:52.503
Asked us some very personal questions.

00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:53.824
It's okay though.

00:12:53.864 --> 00:12:54.384
It's okay.

00:12:54.424 --> 00:12:55.025
You know it.

00:12:55.445 --> 00:12:56.886
Because it's Toko-sen.

00:12:57.146 --> 00:12:59.908
You know she'll help us with any of our issues.

00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:02.750
As a trustworthy class nurse she is, you know.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.693
She even said she would rub my tummy and make it feel better when it hurts.

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:07.473
That's nice.

00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:08.194
Yeah.

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:14.077
We talked about a bunch of things and we laughed a lot!

00:13:14.137 --> 00:13:16.099
And had a bunch of fun too!

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:19.041
And Moco-chan, you even got to touch a horn, right?

00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:20.461
Yeah, I did!

00:13:21.442 --> 00:13:22.583
It felt nice, sorta.

00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:23.984
Sorta soft.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:25.245
Sorta hard.

00:13:29.787 --> 00:13:36.552
But, Ruffians... Only afterwards did I realize...

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:39.526
Do you know what we forgot?

00:13:41.608 --> 00:13:41.888
Wow.

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:47.132
We should have asked Choco-san about why Moco-chan sneezes so much.

00:13:47.692 --> 00:13:49.654
It would have been a good chance, huh?

00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:49.994
Right?

00:13:50.014 --> 00:13:51.776
We could have got that checked out.

00:13:51.796 --> 00:13:52.736
Right?

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:57.120
It was finally the chance to get checked out by a professional we totally forgot!

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.983
Ruffians.

00:14:02.164 --> 00:14:02.504
Why?

00:14:02.904 --> 00:14:05.386
Why didn't you remind us, huh?

00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:07.268
Huh, Ruffians?

00:14:09.335 --> 00:14:11.816
I guess we're all just having too much fun.

00:14:11.856 --> 00:14:12.197
Yeah.

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:14.198
Probably!

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:15.799
BAU BAU, yeah.

00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:17.700
Too much fun, right?

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.740
Right!

00:14:18.861 --> 00:14:20.461
You have work!

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:21.362
I guess that's a good excuse.

00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:26.274
I guess, you know, oh well.

00:14:26.594 --> 00:14:30.356
We'll just have to chat more with Tsukose sometime soon.

00:14:31.817 --> 00:14:33.098
That's only twice.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:37.160
Yup, and then you know, we can look forward to her professional opinion then.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:37.780
Right.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:38.440
Right.

00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:41.722
BAU BAU!

00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:43.643
Yeah, you missed something.

00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:46.905
A collab with Tsukose, maybe?

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.953
Check it out over on Soko-san's channel!

00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:52.333
Okay!

00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:55.216
BAU BAU!

00:14:55.977 --> 00:14:56.217
So.

00:14:57.698 --> 00:14:58.279
Ruffians.

00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:02.362
I wonder, do you have this sometimes?

00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:07.006
You know, when you're trying to go to sleep and you're sort of starting to drift off.

00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:12.531
You know, some crazy thoughts come to your head, sort of knocking you out of that sleepy state.

00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:14.392
Do you have that?

00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:15.053
No.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:15.854
No?

00:15:17.797 --> 00:15:19.277
Every time, yeah.

00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:21.578
I hope it's not every time.

00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:26.879
Well, you know, the other day, the thought came to me.

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:33.241
Does Pero have anyone special in his life?

00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:38.462
You know, is there, in fact, a so-called girly old friend of his?

00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:46.075
This is it!

00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:51.500
You know, he sure does seem to focus on cute girls sometimes.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.763
But truth be told, he's just our pet.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:16:00.486
So, we don't really know those details about his life.

00:16:01.887 --> 00:16:03.248
You know, we don't want to know.

00:16:03.789 --> 00:16:04.369
No.

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.151
You know, why would we ask about stuff like that?

00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:08.732
It's not important.

00:16:08.772 --> 00:16:09.413
No, no.

00:16:11.207 --> 00:16:13.788
I mean, does he have any family members?

00:16:14.748 --> 00:16:18.289
If he had a sister, do you think she'd look like this, Ruffians?

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:21.030
Would she be Pero Tina?

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.831
Lots of questions, huh?

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:25.571
I don't know.

00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.831
Maybe this is a bit of a disturbing thought.

00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:33.253
You see, you know, the ones that get you at that sleepy state are a bit strange, huh?

00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:33.793
Yeah.

00:16:34.613 --> 00:16:35.373
I don't know!

00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:37.174
Um, Moco-chan.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.993
It's kind of rude to think about these things, no?

00:16:41.353 --> 00:16:43.955
I can't control my sleep thoughts, okay?

00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:45.356
It just happens.

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:49.638
It just came to me, you know, and I couldn't help but think about it.

00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:51.479
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.761
I'm not being rude!

00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:56.002
I don't know.

00:16:56.322 --> 00:17:00.384
If there is a Perroccino, there could be a Perroccino, right?

00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:02.025
Don't misunderstand, okay, Ruffians?

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:03.866
You have nightmares from this one?

00:17:06.688 --> 00:17:07.408
Yeah, well...

00:17:08.086 --> 00:17:09.787
You'd rather not think about it.

00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:14.849
I don't know if there is, in fact, a Perroccino.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.730
Do we want that?

00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:19.392
I don't know.

00:17:19.592 --> 00:17:20.712
My gut says no.

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:24.374
I guess mine does too, huh?

00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:27.816
BAU BAU!

00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:29.597
It's too personal.

00:17:30.697 --> 00:17:31.958
You know what, Ruffians?

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:33.858
Just forget about this.

00:17:34.238 --> 00:17:34.579
Yeah.

00:17:35.219 --> 00:17:41.001
If we think about it for too long, it just gets upsetting, so... I think they agree.

00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:43.682
Yeah.

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.643
BAU BAU!

00:17:45.703 --> 00:17:46.083
BAU BAU.

00:17:46.624 --> 00:17:49.245
You don't wanna... I don't wanna go by the Perroccino.

00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:50.665
My Perroccino.

00:17:50.685 --> 00:17:55.607
BAU BAU.

00:17:56.948 --> 00:17:58.208
BAU BAU!

00:17:59.529 --> 00:17:59.929
Goodbye.

00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:03.444
Do we have anything happier, Moco-chan?

00:18:03.464 --> 00:18:04.745
Yeah!

00:18:04.805 --> 00:18:05.385
We do!

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:07.947
That's good.

00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:10.568
I need something happier.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:11.909
Ruffians!

00:18:13.229 --> 00:18:14.750
You remember this, right?

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:19.413
The Legendary Game Series.

00:18:20.202 --> 00:18:21.942
Toho!

00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:22.683
Right?

00:18:22.863 --> 00:18:29.324
Because recently we played a game from, well, the Legendary Bullet Hell series here and there.

00:18:30.044 --> 00:18:32.465
And Moco-chan was surprisingly good at it, right?

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:33.065
Right!

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:33.905
You know.

00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:34.406
Yeah.

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.346
I even impressed myself a bit.

00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:40.087
You know, I really didn't think I'd get as far as I did, huh?

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:41.747
Yeah, you were surprised!

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:42.447
Right!

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:43.388
Surprisingly, yes.

00:18:45.097 --> 00:18:45.557
Thank you.

00:18:45.577 --> 00:18:52.639
You know, the other day, Marine Senchou-senpai, she was playing Touhou Kanjuuden.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.440
The Legacy of the Lunatic Kingdom.

00:18:57.201 --> 00:19:01.482
And apparently, this is one of the most difficult Touhou games.

00:19:01.902 --> 00:19:05.903
And well, Senchou-senpai, she was still playing online.

00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:06.703
And not easy!

00:19:06.763 --> 00:19:07.264
Yeah!

00:19:07.344 --> 00:19:08.384
Even though it's so tough.

00:19:08.444 --> 00:19:11.725
And you know she was doing so well, but it got stuck.

00:19:12.405 --> 00:19:16.747
But then, you know, she would keep on trying until she cleared the area and continued.

00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:16.867
Right?

00:19:18.268 --> 00:19:19.648
Right, right!

00:19:19.668 --> 00:19:20.629
It was so amazing!

00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:28.072
I couldn't help but, you know, clap and be so noisy even though it's super early in the morning, right?

00:19:28.092 --> 00:19:28.432
Right!

00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:36.316
I don't know, we're always so amazed watching her play and, you know, she asked us to try to play Conjugate as well!

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:38.717
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:47.976
Should we maybe practice some other, maybe easier titles before taking on Kanji Den?

00:19:48.356 --> 00:19:51.257
Should we have to sit with Senpai's challenge?

00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.157
Yeah.

00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:54.698
Give it a go!

00:19:54.718 --> 00:19:55.238
Try it!

00:19:55.258 --> 00:19:58.458
It does sound like fun, that is true.

00:19:58.479 --> 00:19:59.699
It is, but you know what?

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:01.099
Maybe get some coaching!

00:20:01.139 --> 00:20:01.479
Why?

00:20:01.499 --> 00:20:05.420
I really do enjoy playing Touhou, you know?

00:20:06.568 --> 00:20:09.972
I would like to get good at it too, like Senchou-senpai!

00:20:10.132 --> 00:20:13.316
She was saying, oh you really think I'm good, huh?

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:14.777
Of course!

00:20:15.518 --> 00:20:20.785
It's a little spooky sometimes, right, Senchou-senpai?

00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:22.547
She's just so good at it!

00:20:24.164 --> 00:20:25.205
I don't know.

00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:28.287
Moco-chan, do your best, okay?

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:30.669
BAU BAU!

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:36.113
If you haven't tried it before, Ruffians, go check it out on Steam, okay?

00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:49.355
Well, in other news, actually, today we received a FUWAMOCO Scoop from a Ruffian!

00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:50.576
BAU BAU!

00:20:50.676 --> 00:20:55.938
Thank you so much, Vistaia, for the impeccable journalism!

00:20:56.358 --> 00:20:58.419
BAU BAU!

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:07.284
Well, Ruffians, it seems like Hayada-senpai and Biboo tried their hands at the Keep Talking, No One Explodes game the other day.

00:21:08.044 --> 00:21:08.284
Right.

00:21:08.464 --> 00:21:12.106
It's always really fun and intense to remember when we played it, right Moco-chan?

00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:13.767
I definitely remember that!

00:21:13.967 --> 00:21:14.187
Right?

00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:20.971
We had so much fun diffusing the balls together and... We did so fast and coordinated.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:21.191
Yes.

00:21:21.951 --> 00:21:22.151
Yeah.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:24.682
Wow!

00:21:25.143 --> 00:21:36.811
It seems like when Biboo was trying to communicate some of the symbols to Kaede-senpai, I don't know if you can see it there, but there's kind of maybe a letter?

00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:37.671
A letter?

00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:38.452
A symbol?

00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:41.294
That reminded Biboo of something.

00:21:41.314 --> 00:21:47.498
Biboo, well, she started to imitate Moco-chan's accent.

00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:51.040
She was like, It's Mococo!

00:21:52.281 --> 00:21:53.022
Moco-chan.

00:21:53.988 --> 00:21:55.228
What do you think of this?

00:21:56.989 --> 00:21:58.129
I don't know what she means.

00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:00.749
What do people mean by this?

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.730
No.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.270
Ruffians!

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:10.591
If you're not familiar... I mean, it's been seven months or so, but if you're not familiar!

00:22:11.712 --> 00:22:13.732
My name is Mococo.

00:22:13.752 --> 00:22:14.132
M-O-C-O-C-O.

00:22:14.172 --> 00:22:14.332
Yep.

00:22:15.393 --> 00:22:17.413
That's how it's spelled.

00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:26.307
It's no E. No E. Yeah.

00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:30.730
So, did Kaela-senpai understand what Biboo meant by that?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.532
Biboo just being silly.

00:22:33.832 --> 00:22:35.834
Making Kaela-senpai confused.

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:37.595
That won't make sense.

00:22:37.835 --> 00:22:38.156
Yeah.

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:38.976
I don't know.

00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:43.360
I don't think her clue makes too much sense, so... Yeah.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.564
I don't think Kaela-senpai would've got it, but... She did.

00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:50.525
She understood.

00:22:50.565 --> 00:22:50.885
What?

00:22:53.404 --> 00:22:54.425
Immediately!

00:22:54.445 --> 00:23:03.433
Understood completely!

00:23:04.814 --> 00:23:07.476
I guess I'm glad that I could help.

00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:14.142
I'm glad you like it, for whatever reason.

00:23:14.162 --> 00:23:16.303
BAU BAU!

00:23:19.944 --> 00:23:20.864
I'm glad for you!

00:23:21.464 --> 00:23:31.148
You know, as long as Biboo's smiling, Haruna-senpai's smiling, and Ruffians... You're smiling!

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:31.969
Then we're good.

00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:36.231
Yeah, but I don't know, maybe it's been a little rough recently.

00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.152
You know, we're getting to the end of the month.

00:23:39.832 --> 00:23:43.534
Maybe the weather's not as good, you know?

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:48.569
Wow, Moco-chan!

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:54.698
Do you have something that maybe you could share with us today?

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:57.142
Do you want that?

00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:00.589
The weather's a lot better?

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:01.589
Oh, that's good then!

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:02.690
You don't need it then!

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.991
The weather is good!

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.752
Doggie of the Day, Doggie of the Day.

00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:08.654
I think the Doggie of the Day today is more cute, maybe.

00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:11.056
The weather is good, the weather is okay.

00:24:11.176 --> 00:24:14.438
Yeah, you have more than enough energy and support than mine.

00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:16.140
Wait, please!

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.861
Please, Mococo!

00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:19.362
Well then!

00:24:22.284 --> 00:24:23.445
Ruffians!

00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:26.066
It's today!

00:24:26.847 --> 00:24:27.828
Today again!

00:24:29.224 --> 00:24:31.125
It's that day of the week!

00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:35.406
It's the day of the week for our Mococo Pup Talk!

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:38.027
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

00:24:38.047 --> 00:24:38.627
Mococo!

00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:39.407
Ruffians!

00:24:41.007 --> 00:24:45.369
Good morning!

00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:49.250
Good morning!

00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:53.531
Are you still sleepy there?

00:24:55.832 --> 00:24:55.932
Uh...

00:24:57.443 --> 00:25:00.145
I can still see the sleep in your eyes a bit, huh?

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.950
Has it been a bit rough recently?

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.873
Have you been working especially hard?

00:25:10.054 --> 00:25:10.494
I don't know.

00:25:10.915 --> 00:25:12.136
It sure looks that way to me.

00:25:13.177 --> 00:25:13.777
Don't worry!

00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:17.741
You're doing amazing!

00:25:19.862 --> 00:25:20.703
Here's a head pat.

00:25:21.184 --> 00:25:22.345
For all the good work!

00:25:23.666 --> 00:25:24.767
Nare nare nare nare!

00:25:26.638 --> 00:25:27.358
I know, I know.

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:33.822
With the lack of sleep and the worries of everything on your shoulders, it can be a bit tough.

00:25:34.522 --> 00:25:41.246
Sometimes you can't help but feel overwhelmed and maybe even a bit teary sometimes.

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:44.087
But it's okay!

00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:46.008
Because you know what?

00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:47.389
I'm here for you.

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:49.050
Fuwawa is here for you.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.131
We know you're doing your best.

00:25:53.277 --> 00:25:58.020
Just keep on going, and eventually, you'll be so much stronger from all of it.

00:25:58.901 --> 00:26:03.624
You know, it may be rough right now, but it's not always gonna be that way.

00:26:04.485 --> 00:26:05.666
No matter what it feels like.

00:26:07.147 --> 00:26:08.187
Everything will work out!

00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:09.548
I know it!

00:26:10.249 --> 00:26:11.229
GANBATTE DE!

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:12.831
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.399
It'll be good.

00:26:18.499 --> 00:26:20.501
You can do it, Ruffians!

00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:21.321
It'll be good, okay!

00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:23.482
BAU BAU, it will work out.

00:26:23.902 --> 00:26:24.363
Well then!

00:26:24.403 --> 00:26:31.346
Today, our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:26:32.327 --> 00:26:34.708
Aspen!

00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:35.849
Aspen!

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:39.951
I don't know, that looks like a puppy who's about to cry really hard.

00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:41.512
Those ears!

00:26:41.612 --> 00:26:43.553
Right, look at those silly ears!

00:26:43.913 --> 00:26:45.394
The paws, too.

00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:46.635
He looks so happy!

00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:50.517
Just a happy puppy.

00:26:50.997 --> 00:27:01.663
Aspen is only three months old and apparently it's very difficult to take this picture of him because he's just go go go going everywhere.

00:27:02.624 --> 00:27:03.505
He's so fine!

00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:04.505
That's a puppy for you.

00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:06.426
That's a puppy, yeah.

00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:10.409
How do you think Aspen BAU BAUs?

00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:20.283
Just like that.

00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:27.688
I can see his little, his big feet moving around.

00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:28.889
Like what?

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:29.710
Like that.

00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:43.541
Well, you know, Aspen is an absolutely adorable puppy!

00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:46.682
I think he's excited a hundred hours a day!

00:27:47.382 --> 00:27:48.163
Probably!

00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:53.885
But if you're not careful, that puppy dog tail might just wag on off.

00:27:54.765 --> 00:27:57.826
You have to make sure you keep an eye on him, okay?

00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.426
He wants to watch over her.

00:27:59.446 --> 00:28:01.107
It might be a little hard, though.

00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:05.469
I think, for now though, he's definitely the one that's taking you on walks so hard.

00:28:06.929 --> 00:28:08.270
BAU BAU!

00:28:09.591 --> 00:28:11.893
Asuka looks so fluffy too!

00:28:11.913 --> 00:28:13.214
Very fuzzy.

00:28:13.895 --> 00:28:14.756
Fuzzy ears.

00:28:15.376 --> 00:28:16.317
So cute!

00:28:17.038 --> 00:28:19.500
BAU BAU!

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.581
Well done!

00:28:21.161 --> 00:28:26.446
Next we have... Today I went on a walk.

00:28:27.603 --> 00:28:33.689
Today's walk is... DE-DEN!

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:41.236
A walk under the SAKURAN with pon-de-ring together with us!

00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:43.118
So nice!

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:43.678
BAU BAU!

00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:48.883
We're so happy to be able to go for a walk together with you!

00:28:49.984 --> 00:28:50.765
Ohanami!

00:28:50.825 --> 00:28:53.548
We have Ohanami so much!

00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:56.410
Our first Hanami together too!

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.072
It's beautiful!

00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:06.360
We're so happy that you're able to get out and enjoy all the blossoms, the colors, and the sun!

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.402
And for the Question of the Day, we have De-den!

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.269
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:32.889
Good morning!

00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:36.830
It tends to be a lot of limited time only food in Japan.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:37.410
Yeah.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:43.851
It's a limited item that you've had once, but no matter how much you tried, you could never find it again.

00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:46.112
That's a sad story there.

00:29:46.632 --> 00:29:48.292
But FUWAMOCO!

00:29:48.512 --> 00:29:50.013
I make sure that never happens.

00:29:50.373 --> 00:29:55.194
Because I'm so weak to limited time items.

00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:55.934
It's really bad.

00:29:57.595 --> 00:30:00.417
I've never had this flavor before.

00:30:00.517 --> 00:30:07.161
So, you know, if it's limited time, then that's my time to enjoy it lots and lots.

00:30:07.602 --> 00:30:15.887
You know, it's hard because they're always so, like, cool and delicious looking, and I feel like I need to get it now, otherwise, you know, I'll never get another chance.

00:30:16.067 --> 00:30:16.247
Right?

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:16.927
Like, it's fate.

00:30:17.408 --> 00:30:19.929
Our paths crossed in this supermarket.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:20.750
Right?

00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:23.932
But, uh...

00:30:24.628 --> 00:30:25.889
I can't think of anything, but...

00:30:43.905 --> 00:30:54.388
Well, there was, however, a really yummy grape-flavored black iced tea that the supermarket would always sell with a claim of limited time.

00:30:54.469 --> 00:30:56.989
Yeah, it was just a limited time only item.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.651
And you know, it was so good, I was really dreading the day that was one day.

00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:06.614
I couldn't get my paws on it again, so I made sure to get it pretty often.

00:31:06.674 --> 00:31:08.675
Moco-chan, you- I liked it!

00:31:08.715 --> 00:31:09.715
It wasn't very sweet.

00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:10.436
No complaints.

00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:11.196
Right?

00:31:11.276 --> 00:31:14.278
It was really, really refreshing and pretty addictive, too.

00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:22.163
But, you know, before we knew it, months and months and months and months went by.

00:31:22.183 --> 00:31:24.004
And it was still there.

00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.331
It's so hot.

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:26.411
Why?

00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:27.332
I don't know.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:28.772
Was it really limited?

00:31:29.692 --> 00:31:32.313
Was it just maybe like a week or two that it wasn't there?

00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:34.134
Like on a stock level?

00:31:34.174 --> 00:31:37.335
When you think about it, everything is limited.

00:31:37.575 --> 00:31:37.995
Yeah.

00:31:38.675 --> 00:31:40.036
Happy for the morning hot.

00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:40.576
Yeah.

00:31:41.436 --> 00:31:46.418
But you know, the happy end to the story is, you know, we never had to say goodbye to it, you know?

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.011
Just a little bit of a confused FUWAMOCO.

00:31:50.071 --> 00:31:51.112
Yeah, but happy.

00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:57.775
But I think otherwise, maybe we should do the Matcha Flavor Pon-de-ring.

00:31:57.795 --> 00:32:00.376
Those are always a nice surprise, right?

00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:03.457
They're sort of a surprise.

00:32:03.877 --> 00:32:05.098
But original.

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:08.359
BAU BAU!

00:32:08.419 --> 00:32:15.723
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your questions, your doggies, your walks, your Pero Sightings.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.894
We're really, really lucky to have you here with us and be a part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:20.914 --> 00:32:22.556
Thank you so much!

00:32:22.716 --> 00:32:30.804

00:32:34.708 --> 00:32:37.411
Well, for our next stream coming up...

00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:43.549
We have, uh, uh, we have brunch with Advent over on the Risu Channel.

00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:46.912
So make sure you have brunch with us too, okay?

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:52.538
But, uh, after that we also have FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:54.459 --> 00:32:56.642
You can always depend on it.

00:32:57.182 --> 00:33:00.105
And we're picking another gladiator schedule here.

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:09.354
You can see we have a very big Rock n' Roar party coming up on Saturday, Ruffians!

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:14.800
There's been a lot of really, really memorable Rock n' Roar parties.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.902
I'm sure there will also be another one.

00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:26.805
We have a big announcement, so we hope, Ruffians, that you'll be able to be there and cheer a bunch for us.

00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:31.236
Big, big announcement.

00:33:31.816 --> 00:33:36.597
We're looking forward to it!

00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:46.059
Once again, we just want you to know how thankful we are to be a part of your morning.

00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:48.440
Three times a week?

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:48.560
Right!

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.261
There's nothing to sneeze at.

00:33:51.581 --> 00:33:53.741
