05:04.710 --> 05:07.106
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:07.426 --> 05:11.008
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:11.028 --> 05:14.591
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:14.651 --> 05:16.833
BAU BAU!

05:17.433 --> 05:20.055
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:20.075 --> 05:23.137
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:23.297 --> 05:26.639
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:26.700 --> 05:28.081
BAU BAU!

05:28.541 --> 05:32.664
And today, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:33.264 --> 05:34.325
Thank you, Ruffians,

05:35.080 --> 05:40.946
Join us for coming here to join us for your final weekday of the week!

05:42.948 --> 05:43.068
What?

05:43.088 --> 05:44.209
Why are you laughing?

05:44.770 --> 05:45.871
I got confused.

05:45.991 --> 05:51.156
I thought you were saying for your final FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:51.757 --> 05:52.177
No!

05:52.638 --> 05:53.558
Not the final.

05:53.618 --> 05:55.360
Today is the 29th episode.

05:57.662 --> 06:05.829
Whenever you say the final episode of the week, it always scares me and I think the ruffians are the same.

06:05.929 --> 06:07.590
You're just trying to jumpstart the morning.

06:07.610 --> 06:07.870
BAU BAU!

06:15.765 --> 06:25.652
Well, for some first-time ruffians who thought they were here for their first FUWAMOCO Morning, but turned out to be their final and final one, I'll explain that.

06:25.672 --> 06:33.698
FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show and it's held every Friday today, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:33.778 --> 06:35.039
Yeah, FUWAMOCO.

06:35.239 --> 06:38.521
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:38.962 --> 06:44.446
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:45.967 --> 06:51.091
Okay, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:51.572 --> 06:54.514
Hashtag, FUWAMOCO.

06:54.574 --> 06:55.275
FWMCMORNING.

06:55.375 --> 06:55.775
Okay.

06:55.795 --> 06:57.637
Got it.

06:59.078 --> 07:02.801
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:02.821 --> 07:05.503
BAU BAU!

07:06.304 --> 07:09.347
Now first off, we already have

07:10.310 --> 07:13.631
Another Pero Sighting!

07:14.311 --> 07:14.671
De-den.

07:15.472 --> 07:18.452
See the DVD?

07:19.293 --> 07:25.554
It looks like a ruffian was doing some cleaning at work and found Pero between the DVDs.

07:25.895 --> 07:29.516
Do you see ruffians on the left there?

07:32.558 --> 07:34.520
Is he digital now?

07:34.860 --> 07:36.661
But it's a DVD.

07:36.681 --> 07:37.762
Not a CD, a DVD.

07:37.922 --> 07:40.164
Okay, DVD Peron.

07:40.244 --> 07:48.190
No matter how much we like all the physical media and having DVDs around, even now, we know that the times are for YouTube, right?

07:48.330 --> 07:50.792
Yeah, DVD's time is over.

07:51.132 --> 07:52.794
I don't know what Peron's thinking.

07:52.914 --> 07:53.974
Sweet Peron.

07:54.155 --> 07:57.757
And he's asking the ruffians to bring pudding.

07:58.898 --> 08:00.618
No, Pero, you know!

08:00.919 --> 08:01.699
YouTube!

08:01.779 --> 08:03.219
No, it's YouTube!

08:03.279 --> 08:08.380
Yeah, the title is not Bring Me Pudding, it's Please Like and Subscribe and all that, you know.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.961
Hit the bell for notifications or something like that, right?

08:13.021 --> 08:15.002
You've done that all, right, Ruffians?

08:15.782 --> 08:16.262
Right?

08:16.282 --> 08:18.902
Maybe the DVD times was Bring Me Pudding.

08:19.162 --> 08:21.083
Maybe, maybe that was the thing then, but...

08:22.003 --> 08:23.065
Yeah, I don't know.

08:23.085 --> 08:27.970
He's trying in his own kind of way, but maybe it's a few decades late.

08:29.332 --> 08:30.894
Am I too late?

08:30.974 --> 08:34.678
I can't help but wonder what does happen if you bring him pudding though.

08:36.354 --> 08:40.996
Well, Ruffian, you'll have to see and give it a shot for us, right?

08:41.716 --> 08:42.737
See what happens.

08:43.877 --> 08:46.758
But please prepare for the worst, too.

08:46.778 --> 08:54.682
You know, it can be sort of rough sometimes seeing him try to eat the whole pudding on his own as fast as he can before he can grab it away from him.

08:55.322 --> 08:56.963
We can be pretty desperate.

08:57.043 --> 08:59.745
BAU BAU!

08:59.765 --> 09:01.707
Ruffians, thank you!

09:01.767 --> 09:02.367
Thank you!

09:02.788 --> 09:05.570
This is pretty cool though, DVD.

09:05.910 --> 09:08.632
Please let us know if you see Pero around again!

09:08.672 --> 09:10.433
Maybe next time it'll be a Blu-ray.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.154
Oh, maybe.

09:11.454 --> 09:13.656
That'll be the next best step up, right?

09:13.756 --> 09:14.456
Next step up.

09:14.736 --> 09:15.277
BAU BAU!

09:15.337 --> 09:17.719
Wow, Ruffians, this weekend

09:22.398 --> 09:22.998
Sighting!

09:23.598 --> 09:25.379
In case you didn't know!

09:26.839 --> 09:28.740
De-den!

09:29.280 --> 09:30.620
On Sunday!

09:31.801 --> 09:44.404
On Sunday at 8pm PT, 12pm JST, I, Senpai Iris, and all of FUWAMOCO will be having a special 3D showcase all together!

09:44.624 --> 09:50.086
We're really excited to see everyone having fun in their 3D bodies all together this time!

09:50.766 --> 10:04.337
You know, just like you ruffians, we're not too sure what to expect, but we sure will be able to see their strong bond all together in action, and hopefully, maybe, some singing and dancing.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.960
Let's all go end it with a BIG BANG!

10:36.418 --> 10:37.919
You'll get it if you miss it, okay?

10:38.559 --> 10:39.020
Got it!

10:39.960 --> 10:40.320
Got it!

10:40.361 --> 10:42.402
You'll be there, right?

10:44.303 --> 10:48.145
BAU BAU!

10:48.525 --> 10:51.927
Wow, we've also had some exciting things going on.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.029
I saw the ruffians.

10:54.169 --> 10:59.052
I don't know if any ruffians noticed though, because... You have to count.

10:59.892 --> 11:00.893
Math is difficult.

11:01.033 --> 11:01.393
It is.

11:02.173 --> 11:02.974
We did for you.

11:03.414 --> 11:04.155
Yeah, we did.

11:05.805 --> 11:06.946
You know ruffians?

11:08.246 --> 11:10.388
Are there some math ruffians out there?

11:11.869 --> 11:13.730
Math ruffians?

11:14.130 --> 11:16.571
It didn't work.

11:19.233 --> 11:22.675
I see one ruffian that's called a math ruffian.

11:24.476 --> 11:24.776
You know?

11:27.040 --> 11:31.765
We have happy news because we've hit over 100 livestreams on YouTube!

11:31.825 --> 11:50.624
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

11:53.371 --> 11:59.416
You know, considering it's been only two months and a bit or so, I think that's worth celebrating, you know?

12:00.237 --> 12:04.901
But hopefully our math added up because it does sound kind of suspicious, too.

12:05.101 --> 12:05.642
It does.

12:05.922 --> 12:06.162
It does.

12:06.262 --> 12:09.105
I did check multiple times because I thought that can't be right.

12:11.153 --> 12:16.418
Anyways, it's been a very happy and fun filled 100 days with you, Ruffians.

12:16.979 --> 12:24.606
Of course, we hope there's gonna be many many many many many many many more continuing on for a long long long long long long time.

12:24.626 --> 12:31.233
Long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long time!

12:31.253 --> 12:31.313
Bye!

12:31.873 --> 12:36.397
You know, there's so many things we want to do, and lots of games we want to play with you, you know?

12:37.378 --> 12:42.522
So no matter how tricky or rough things can be sometimes, we'll keep on trying and doing our best, okay?

12:42.782 --> 12:43.563
You know?

12:44.163 --> 12:44.764
We're stubborn.

12:45.304 --> 12:46.065
Very hungry.

12:46.085 --> 12:49.187
And we're puppies.

12:49.227 --> 12:53.070
We're excited for everything still coming up.

12:53.531 --> 12:57.454
Thank you for always being by our side and supporting us here, ruffians.

12:57.494 --> 12:58.034
Thank you!

12:58.054 --> 12:59.015
BAU BAU!

12:59.075 --> 12:59.856
BAU BAU!

13:02.488 --> 13:04.249
Happy, happy day.

13:04.889 --> 13:06.550
Happy FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:07.010 --> 13:07.730
Time to end it.

13:10.171 --> 13:10.891
And not a happy note.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.752
I wish it didn't have to be this way.

13:12.812 --> 13:13.952
And not a happy note, right?

13:15.793 --> 13:22.236
But I think we need to clear up this misunderstanding, right Moco-chan?

13:23.616 --> 13:24.036
Yeah.

13:24.776 --> 13:25.537
It's important.

13:26.932 --> 13:33.477
Ruffians, you know, the other day we spent a while playing Resident Evil 4 Remake together, right?

13:33.977 --> 13:34.317
Right.

13:34.738 --> 13:38.701
And there were a lot of grandmas and grandpas everywhere we went.

13:39.121 --> 13:39.461
Right.

13:39.481 --> 13:41.523
Like that.

13:42.873 --> 13:45.895
You know, we were thinking that...

14:02.113 --> 14:11.182
There probably are some ruffians who might think that us, the FUWAMOCO, think that violence towards the elderly is okay.

14:11.562 --> 14:12.022
It's not.

14:12.162 --> 14:12.683
It's not!

14:13.464 --> 14:15.706
Absolutely not!

14:15.886 --> 14:17.467
Never ever ever ever!

14:19.469 --> 14:23.613
We have to show our respect for them and help them when they need help too.

14:24.950 --> 14:34.294
You know when they have scary eyes and are rotting and throwing axes and then bombs and then knives and are trying to bite us, you know?

14:35.454 --> 14:38.436
Extreme measures might have to be taken, you know?

14:38.796 --> 14:39.276
Yeah.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.197
Extreme violence.

14:42.437 --> 14:43.578
Extreme violence!

14:44.937 --> 14:45.877
Extreme violence!

14:46.698 --> 14:53.760
But otherwise, ruffians, let's make sure to be nice to the... the happy grandmas, the happy grandpas.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.620
Happy grandma and grandpas, okay?

14:55.640 --> 14:59.401
The ones without the scary eyes throwing knives and bombs and trying to fight us.

14:59.961 --> 15:02.602
Yeah, make sure you don't get lost in their eyes, okay?

15:03.022 --> 15:05.623
Understood?

15:06.263 --> 15:08.384
Understood, ruffians?

15:09.044 --> 15:10.464
Only in the game.

15:10.484 --> 15:11.304
Only in the game.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.365
Only in the game.

15:14.500 --> 15:14.900
Got it.

15:15.821 --> 15:16.341
Understood?

15:16.441 --> 15:16.741
Okay.

15:17.021 --> 15:18.641
BAU BAU!

15:19.442 --> 15:22.823
It would be bad if the ruffians misunderstood that one, right?

15:26.964 --> 15:27.204
What?

15:27.384 --> 15:28.885
Was it yesterday?

15:29.545 --> 15:39.909
Well, you know, I think it was during Resident Evil 4 too, but we also kinda shared with you the other day about how hard it can get in a studio human world.

15:41.368 --> 15:43.973
It can get really really really hot.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.256
It's a bit of a secret.

15:45.276 --> 15:47.039
A bit of a secret, yeah.

15:48.571 --> 15:54.034
I think doing Resident Evil 4, it got up to 32 degrees.

15:54.535 --> 15:55.535
Very humid.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.277
Very sticky.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.579
Yeah, so that's why we can get pretty sweaty doing scary games.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.400
Especially scary games.

16:04.841 --> 16:08.263
Yeah, we're screaming and panicking, you know?

16:08.643 --> 16:08.823
Yeah.

16:09.123 --> 16:10.304
Moco-chan.

16:11.124 --> 16:12.365
Moco-chan here.

16:12.465 --> 16:16.687
Moco-chan has a secret that she's been keeping from you ruffians.

16:18.466 --> 16:22.649
I haven't been keeping it from you, I just... I don't know.

16:22.669 --> 16:23.370
Really?

16:24.510 --> 16:25.711
Does it have to get shared?

16:25.731 --> 16:29.514
I mentioned it yesterday.

16:31.015 --> 16:33.897
Then you have to!

16:35.618 --> 16:38.440
So... I don't know why, but...

16:44.924 --> 16:46.210
It's FUWAMOCO-chan.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.106
You can't keep the secret from the ruffians any longer.

16:51.095 --> 16:52.096
Don't think about it, okay?

16:52.116 --> 16:53.296
Don't use your brain, okay?

16:54.417 --> 16:54.937
It's hot.

16:55.417 --> 17:02.841
It's hot in the studio, but... For some reason, my toes are almost always really, really cold, okay?

17:03.081 --> 17:04.482
Like, like ice cube cold.

17:05.682 --> 17:07.644
So it can be pretty uncomfy.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.565
So then... Don't say here it comes, okay?

17:10.965 --> 17:16.848
So even if I'm really, really hot in general, then, you know, my toes are really cold.

17:17.629 --> 17:19.850
So then... You know...

17:21.138 --> 17:22.378
I have a special solution.

17:23.679 --> 17:24.339
It's just for me.

17:24.439 --> 17:25.899
Just for Mococo.

17:25.939 --> 17:29.440
You know, I have a special foot warmer.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.340
Underneath.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.341
So that you know, I can keep my paws warm.

17:36.421 --> 17:39.282
This way I'm comfy, I can focus, I'm all good.

17:39.362 --> 17:39.742
You know.

17:40.622 --> 17:45.743
It probably makes me a bit hotter, especially during games when I'm focusing on guard dog training, but

17:47.148 --> 17:50.170
Maybe that just makes the training better and more effective.

17:52.652 --> 17:57.096
But you know, sometimes I make a mistake.

17:58.577 --> 18:06.183
And I turn up the heat too much by accident and then I have to remove my feet so that they don't start burning, you know?

18:07.645 --> 18:10.507
Not a Fuwawa warmer, okay?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.209
But you'll never know if that happens, okay?

18:13.229 --> 18:13.789
Yeah.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.935
My feet are burning!

18:18.216 --> 18:19.438
No, no, no.

18:19.718 --> 18:20.960
It's my secret, okay?

18:22.813 --> 18:28.538
You know, I'm just hoping that the foot warmer doesn't break soon because I've been using it a lot!

18:28.918 --> 18:30.139
But, it should be good.

18:30.399 --> 18:32.141
It's kind of scary though, Moco-chan.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.543
Sometimes you leave it on for so long.

18:35.283 --> 18:37.325
Until you turn it off and you don't.

18:37.365 --> 18:40.007
The only time I get sort of angry is when it goes off.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.009
Because it's just on a timer.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.211
It's an eight hour timer, no?

18:44.311 --> 18:47.253
Yeah, and sometimes it goes off and then I get sad.

18:47.273 --> 18:51.437
I don't know, I think it's a hazard, ruffians.

18:53.109 --> 18:53.489
It's good.

18:55.071 --> 19:00.977
At least you know when you use the foot warmer then Moco-chan will accidentally touch me with her cold toes.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.680
True.

19:03.940 --> 19:04.821
That's the happy part.

19:04.841 --> 19:06.002
Just wear socks!

19:07.423 --> 19:07.644
No.

19:08.725 --> 19:11.668
BAU BAU!

19:11.728 --> 19:12.709
That was my secret.

19:13.830 --> 19:14.511
Do you feel better?

19:16.494 --> 19:21.056
Ruffians, do you feel better now that Moco-chan finally told you her secret?

19:21.096 --> 19:21.516
You better.

19:21.996 --> 19:25.198
What are slippers, Moco-chan?

19:25.218 --> 19:27.119
They make me frustrated.

19:27.139 --> 19:28.499
She leaves them everywhere.

19:28.519 --> 19:31.401
I have slippers!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.782
I just forget them everywhere, okay?

19:33.802 --> 19:34.662
Let's continue.

19:39.355 --> 19:40.115
Ruffians!

19:40.415 --> 19:44.477
We have... It's been two months since our debut, right?

19:44.677 --> 19:50.420
And today's our 101st... First... Livestream.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.961
But the day is finally here!

19:53.981 --> 19:55.582
Ruffians!

19:57.003 --> 20:04.666
We have... Our very first... Gumi Livestream!

20:04.746 --> 20:05.606
Is this how it's done?

20:05.946 --> 20:06.887
Is this how it's done?

20:08.871 --> 20:10.791
Ruffians, this is how we're gonna do it.

20:11.311 --> 20:18.153
You know we told you yesterday, we didn't really feel like we got quite enough of a Suica game, right?

20:18.793 --> 20:25.834
We're gonna play more Suica game!

20:25.914 --> 20:29.195
Watermelon!

20:29.535 --> 20:35.776
We're gonna be doing it shortly after Rock n' Rawr Party tomorrow at 1AM PST.

20:37.556 --> 20:38.837
5AM JST.

20:39.237 --> 20:43.120
I'm sorry, 5PM JST.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.583
We really didn't feel like we were able to show off all our skills yesterday.

20:47.863 --> 20:54.967
So hopefully, you know, this time we can get a new high score and be the top dogs of Suica Game and Holo EN.

20:55.668 --> 20:56.929
Ruffians, you think we can do it?

20:58.783 --> 21:02.064
The score only counts if it's on stream, right?

21:03.004 --> 21:08.446
And I think it's much more fun playing together with you, ruffians, than off stream.

21:08.806 --> 21:09.787
There's not much of a point.

21:12.528 --> 21:17.729
But we also do know that the time might be a bit difficult for some ruffians to join us.

21:17.969 --> 21:21.631
But don't worry because they'll be in the archive there waiting for you too.

21:21.971 --> 21:24.252
It'll be okay, okay?

21:24.352 --> 21:27.153
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, okay?

21:28.593 --> 21:32.957
But I'm just looking forward to being able to satisfy our watermelon baby.

21:32.977 --> 21:35.019
Yeah, we need to see the watermelon more.

21:35.099 --> 21:37.561
Right, we didn't even see him for a second.

21:37.581 --> 21:39.362
He was there but then gone.

21:42.685 --> 21:43.686
This time for sure.

21:43.786 --> 21:45.328
BAU BAU!

21:45.468 --> 21:48.070
We hope that you'll be there if you can.

21:48.110 --> 21:49.651
But don't force yourself, okay?

21:49.812 --> 21:50.432
BAU BAU!

21:55.069 --> 21:57.690
I think it's time for us to move to a regular corner today.

21:57.810 --> 21:58.810
We have our Doggie of the Day.

21:58.830 --> 22:01.871
And it is... This is the Doggie of the Day!

22:01.891 --> 22:02.932
A cute girl.

22:03.032 --> 22:23.439
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

22:23.439 --> 22:23.699
Ruffians!

22:39.409 --> 22:44.451
I wonder, you know, how did she get her nose so glowing and lustrous?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.572
It's like shiny.

22:46.772 --> 22:50.193
Like something you put on a tree for Christmas.

22:50.474 --> 22:52.274
We didn't get her name, though.

22:52.754 --> 22:53.495
What should it be?

22:53.515 --> 22:55.115
Do we name her now?

22:57.932 --> 22:59.332
Ruffians, do you have a name?

22:59.392 --> 23:00.172
Omega Fluff.

23:00.192 --> 23:03.573
I feel like something like Florence would work well.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.214
Florence, is that a girl name?

23:07.234 --> 23:08.134
It sounds fluffy.

23:09.294 --> 23:09.935
Florence.

23:11.135 --> 23:12.475
Fluffington.

23:12.995 --> 23:13.675
Flora.

23:14.155 --> 23:14.876
Flora.

23:16.716 --> 23:17.556
Florenza.

23:18.456 --> 23:19.557
Flufferina?

23:19.577 --> 23:21.717
I kinda like that.

23:22.097 --> 23:22.897
Florenza.

23:23.597 --> 23:24.698
Florenza it is.

23:24.718 --> 23:25.718
Florenza.

23:26.749 --> 23:27.549
Florenza.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.310
Fluffy.

23:28.470 --> 23:29.671
Oh, I like the spelling.

23:30.371 --> 23:31.812
Florenza is decided.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.313
All the ruffians like it.

23:33.373 --> 23:33.913
Fuwa!

23:34.153 --> 23:34.433
Fuwa!

23:34.954 --> 23:35.734
What?

23:36.254 --> 23:37.095
Fuwa!

23:37.115 --> 23:38.556
I like it.

23:38.916 --> 23:39.756
Fuwa.

23:39.776 --> 23:40.957
F-O-O-F-A.

23:41.197 --> 23:42.698
Is that like a Moomin?

23:43.058 --> 23:44.739
No, it's a Fuwa.

23:45.139 --> 23:46.240
She's Fuwa.

23:46.740 --> 23:48.461
BAU BAU Fuwa!

23:48.601 --> 23:49.162
Decided.

23:49.542 --> 23:50.122
Decided.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.914
Well, how did Fuwa BAU BAU do?

23:54.934 --> 23:57.021
We got distracted, huh?

23:57.041 --> 23:58.305
I think it'd be like...

24:02.826 --> 24:04.607
I guess that makes sense.

24:04.627 --> 24:09.470
You know, she probably doesn't want to BAU BAU that often because, you know... She just wants to smile.

24:09.530 --> 24:20.517
I'm well-mannered, so... Maybe a bit quieter, maybe like... BAU BAU!

24:20.597 --> 24:23.279
I think she's a beauty and a best friend.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.380
I'm a little envious.

24:25.500 --> 24:30.544
Do you think we'll ever even get close to her level, Moco-chan?

24:30.765 --> 24:32.186
I don't know.

24:32.206 --> 24:33.487
We have to work hard.

24:34.227 --> 24:35.428
But she's cute!

24:35.869 --> 24:37.010
She's beautiful!

24:37.370 --> 24:37.950
Advent.

24:38.531 --> 24:42.334
And we should be both making each other smile a lot tonight.

24:43.035 --> 24:43.895
BAU BAU!

24:43.915 --> 24:45.537
Thank you!

24:46.578 --> 24:48.019
BAU BAU!

24:48.039 --> 24:51.341
Did a ruffian go out for a little journey for a walk?

24:51.361 --> 24:51.802
I hope so.

24:53.365 --> 24:54.190
Let's take a look.

24:55.396 --> 24:55.919
De-den!

24:59.549 --> 25:00.550
What type of walk is this?

25:00.950 --> 25:07.133
This is both the scariest and bravest walk I've ever seen a ruffian go on.

25:09.354 --> 25:10.034
Please be safe.

25:11.635 --> 25:19.978
Yeah, you know, taking shortcuts late at night is sort of strange, but you know, at least haunted.

25:19.998 --> 25:21.939
That brings me a bit concerned, you know?

25:21.979 --> 25:22.859
What's with that?

25:23.540 --> 25:24.080
BAU BAU.

25:25.521 --> 25:31.985
It is fun to go out for late-night walks, but you know, Moco-chan and I, we're both too scaredy for that.

25:32.025 --> 25:33.406
It's dark there.

25:33.466 --> 25:36.188
You also have to make sure to stay safe, guys.

25:36.248 --> 25:37.449
Safety, safety.

25:37.509 --> 25:43.193
Yeah, make sure others know where you are and that you wear reflective clothing during the night time.

25:43.374 --> 25:46.736
You know, maybe a bear whistle or something too might be good.

25:46.756 --> 25:47.216
Right?

25:48.217 --> 25:54.663
Yeah, but it'll be really hard for others to see you, so let's make sure that we're keeping ourselves safe, okay?

25:54.744 --> 25:54.944
Right!

25:55.304 --> 25:55.664
Alright.

25:55.965 --> 25:57.346
Safety is important, okay?

25:57.366 --> 26:00.689
We wouldn't want anything to happen to you, okay, ruffians?

26:01.370 --> 26:02.331
BAU BAU.

26:02.711 --> 26:07.476
I guess it's good for not letting the spooky things get to you and stop you from going on a- Get to you?

26:07.496 --> 26:08.878
Spooky things get to you?

26:09.558 --> 26:10.900
Well, like, you know, like your heart.

26:11.160 --> 26:11.560
Your heart.

26:12.481 --> 26:12.701
BAU BAU!

26:30.481 --> 26:33.242
We got a question from a ruffian, Moco-chan.

26:33.762 --> 26:34.943
Let's take a peek at it.

26:35.303 --> 26:36.863
De-den!

26:37.384 --> 26:41.345
I remember you doggos expressing your love for cute scale figures.

26:41.405 --> 26:46.046
Would it be possible for you to discuss or share your collection?

26:46.447 --> 26:53.149
I got into figure collecting from being a long time lover of anime, so I'd definitely be interested in hearing more about it.

26:53.169 --> 26:54.269
Thank you!

26:54.469 --> 26:56.010
Thank you for the question.

26:56.550 --> 26:59.553
We love scale figures too!

26:59.573 --> 27:03.836
But you know, we haven't bought anything for a long time.

27:04.157 --> 27:13.424
You know, they used to be pretty affordable and obtainable with the same kind of quality as the ones we produce now, but you know, they used to be around maybe 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 yen.

27:13.845 --> 27:16.287
We bought them used though, right?

27:23.134 --> 27:30.159
But now the ones now, they have like a crazy long pre-order to production to release window.

27:30.519 --> 27:33.061
Like a year and a half, right?

27:33.981 --> 27:38.044
But you know, we're sure that's because the ones are much smaller.

27:38.304 --> 27:40.546
Things have probably improved greatly since then too.

27:40.586 --> 27:43.708
You know if you don't pre-order it, sometimes you just can't get it.

27:44.848 --> 27:47.130
We're not ready, we're not ready for that.

27:48.642 --> 27:50.183
I can't think that far ahead.

27:53.123 --> 27:55.884
But you know, we really like the large scale figures.

27:56.184 --> 27:58.565
Like 1 sixth or bigger.

27:58.585 --> 28:02.946
1 eighth is nice, but 1 seventh is like the sweet spot.

28:03.506 --> 28:07.947
But anything bigger is like, I'm excited for this one.

28:07.967 --> 28:16.329
But you know with figures, it's really nice because you're able to have your favorite character in 3D, in your living space.

28:16.589 --> 28:17.249
It's really happy.

28:17.469 --> 28:18.349
It was really fun.

28:43.335 --> 28:48.418
You know, we are able to see everyone's garage kits that they put so much love and passion into.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.779
Garage kits are like the, just the parts.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.780
The parts that you can make yourself.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.941
You use resin.

28:53.961 --> 28:54.801
Resin.

28:54.861 --> 28:55.081
Yeah.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.283
And then you paint them with airbrushes and stuff.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.704
Put them together, pin them, all that stuff.

28:59.784 --> 29:00.424
Sanding.

29:00.444 --> 29:02.625
Very, very cool.

29:02.705 --> 29:03.246
Glue.

29:03.686 --> 29:06.908
And make sure that you're wearing the goggles and that you have ventilation.

29:06.968 --> 29:07.768
All that stuff.

29:08.128 --> 29:08.748
Very cool.

29:08.929 --> 29:10.629
You know, we'd like to build them someday too.

29:12.431 --> 29:17.859
Especially with Fuwawa and the humidifier, I feel like it might be dangerous.

29:19.838 --> 29:21.379
It's important to have good lungs.

29:24.121 --> 29:27.863
But we actually own a few very special garage kits.

29:28.203 --> 29:34.207
But we first want to ask someone who knows what they're doing to build them and paint them for us, I think.

29:34.868 --> 29:36.909
We never trust ourselves to do a good job.

29:37.369 --> 29:40.631
Especially, you know, if they're special and old.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.592
You can't get those anymore.

29:42.612 --> 29:43.653
They've been gone forever.

29:45.554 --> 29:51.757
We have it on our big goal list too, but we hope that one day we can become figures too!

29:52.337 --> 30:00.040
And that way, you know, you can feel as happy as us seeing us in your room as we do the characters we love.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.001
But besides scale figures, we have Nendoroids.

30:04.461 --> 30:06.202
They're really cute too.

30:06.242 --> 30:06.822
You know what?

30:08.023 --> 30:09.864
I... Wait...

30:11.348 --> 30:14.849
Demon guard dogs, not puppies, but you know, we were actually remembering.

30:15.269 --> 30:19.890
Thinking about trying to collect all Nendoroids when they started coming out too.

30:20.130 --> 30:24.572
But it's for the best, we didn't try that.

30:25.152 --> 30:28.513
But there are so many cute ones, and we have more than that.

30:28.553 --> 30:30.333
We do have a lot.

30:30.613 --> 30:31.753
But it would have been a journey.

30:31.854 --> 30:35.394
Especially our Senpai Nendoroids too.

30:38.137 --> 30:38.537
BAU BAU!

30:38.557 --> 30:38.918
Thank you!

30:38.998 --> 30:41.101
It's always a good question.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.343
Thank you for all your submissions today, ruffians!

31:00.283 --> 31:01.204
Remember.

31:01.284 --> 31:01.684
Remember.

31:01.824 --> 31:02.265
Remember.

31:02.465 --> 31:02.985
Remember what?

31:03.005 --> 31:03.826
You don't remember.

31:03.866 --> 31:04.426
I don't remember.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.247
I want to remind the ruffians.

31:06.708 --> 31:09.850
FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make all together.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.292
So, we want to say thank you always for your submissions.

31:13.312 --> 31:18.436
And we want to remind you too that we're looking forward to seeing more of your Doggie of the Day.

31:18.736 --> 31:20.797
To seeing the walks that you're going on.

31:20.817 --> 31:21.658
Even if they're spooky.

31:21.918 --> 31:22.198
Right?

31:22.238 --> 31:23.819
Receiving your burning questions.

31:23.859 --> 31:24.400
Exactly.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.631
Maybe getting more Pero sightings too.

31:27.691 --> 31:30.512
Hopefully Pero stays out of your hair.

31:30.913 --> 31:32.433
And don't forget to use the hashtag!

31:32.453 --> 31:33.354
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

31:33.554 --> 31:34.094
BAU BAU!

31:34.154 --> 31:34.694
Our next theme!

31:34.714 --> 31:35.175
We have...

31:43.610 --> 31:44.592
De-den!

31:44.612 --> 31:46.996
We're teaming up again with Advent!

31:47.638 --> 31:51.525
And we're gonna be doing some more Left 4 Dead 2 today.

31:52.847 --> 31:55.673
Hopefully this time we don't get Left 4 Dead.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.076
Last time was rough huh?

31:59.096 --> 31:59.596
It was rough.

31:59.916 --> 32:00.877
I'll never forget it.

32:02.018 --> 32:05.620
I think we caught a hang of the melee combat.

32:05.700 --> 32:06.401
I think I did!

32:06.421 --> 32:11.604
Do you think we're ready to use the katana to cut through more zombies?

32:12.104 --> 32:13.045
BAU BAU!

32:13.065 --> 32:15.507
Is that a war cry?

32:15.727 --> 32:16.787
BAU BAU!

32:17.088 --> 32:18.128
BAU BAU!

32:19.409 --> 32:22.910
Well, let's take a look at our schedule!

32:22.930 --> 32:24.450
We have our schedule!

32:24.610 --> 32:30.612
And tomorrow we'll be having another rock n' rawr party together with you!

32:30.712 --> 32:36.133
We've got kind of a better idea of what we want to sing this time now.

32:36.293 --> 32:38.813
I think it's going to be a mix of everything!

32:41.474 --> 32:49.231
More than anything we just want to have a lot of fun all together so we picked a bunch of our karaoke favorites and also some newer songs too.

32:52.219 --> 32:53.380
Please join us, okay?

32:53.420 --> 32:55.601
Get ready to howl a lot!

32:56.181 --> 32:58.542
Don't forget our Suika game after that too, okay?

32:58.562 --> 32:59.863
It's not on there because it's gorilla.

33:00.043 --> 33:01.664
Yeah, gorilla.

33:01.704 --> 33:04.205
Gorilla, but no bananas, just watermelons.

33:04.245 --> 33:04.905
Just watermelons.

33:04.925 --> 33:05.866
Oh, that's true.

33:06.206 --> 33:09.167
We got our banana gorillas and our watermelon gorillas.

33:09.427 --> 33:10.208
All the gorillas.

33:10.228 --> 33:11.208
We're dogs.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.730
BAU BAU!

33:15.531 --> 33:23.175
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning and the last FUWAMOCO Morning of this week.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.517
Thank you!

33:26.537 --> 33:33.121
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special Ruffians today!

33:35.772 --> 33:39.315
I'm using my eyes, but... Miraizou!

33:39.395 --> 33:40.576

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
