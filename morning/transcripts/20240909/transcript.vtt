05:11.513 --> 05:15.416
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:15.436 --> 05:18.419
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.539 --> 05:23.663
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.364 --> 05:27.366
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.706 --> 05:29.688
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:35.062 --> 05:39.366
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:40.207 --> 05:41.368
It's a Monday!

05:41.408 --> 05:42.169
Wake up!

05:42.429 --> 05:42.870
Wake up!

05:43.050 --> 05:44.251
Wake up!

05:45.392 --> 05:46.953
Thank you for waking up.

05:47.294 --> 05:50.657
And joining us today for our 124th episode, BAU BAU!

05:57.433 --> 05:58.214
How are you doing?

05:58.234 --> 05:59.356
Is that bad?

05:59.597 --> 06:00.578
I see that.

06:00.739 --> 06:01.480
You are awake!

06:01.680 --> 06:03.664
Let me just fluff that on out.

06:04.245 --> 06:04.886
Sleepy.

06:06.793 --> 06:08.554
It's okay!

06:08.614 --> 06:08.854
No!

06:08.974 --> 06:12.116
FUWAMOCO Morning is now, no more 5 more minutes!

06:13.117 --> 06:15.478
BAU BAU!

06:15.558 --> 06:25.083
Well, for those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:25.343 --> 06:25.884
A.K.A.

06:25.944 --> 06:26.844

06:26.984 --> 06:27.905
Hosted by us,

06:28.525 --> 06:29.046

Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:41.357 --> 06:45.041

06:49.445 --> 06:50.226
BAU BAU!

06:52.808 --> 06:55.209
Ruffians, do you have it memorized yet?

06:55.609 --> 06:58.170
Are you awake?

06:58.750 --> 07:00.811
You have breakfast!

07:02.212 --> 07:04.613
Don't eat the hashtags for breakfast, okay?

07:04.913 --> 07:07.474
They look like cereal, FUWAMOCO-chan.

07:08.555 --> 07:09.615
Hashtag cereal.

07:10.356 --> 07:13.057
Hashtag breakfast cereal idea.

07:13.900 --> 07:14.320
What?!

07:14.501 --> 07:19.945
It's gonna be extra trendy, Moco-chan!

07:20.405 --> 07:22.887
Don't need to aim it, name it, name it anything!

07:22.907 --> 07:24.428
Just you know, on the box.

07:24.769 --> 07:25.149
It's trendy.

07:25.689 --> 07:28.532
At HelloVenica, hashtag trending.

07:36.452 --> 07:43.237
Good twins in class.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.598
BAU BAU!

07:45.919 --> 07:48.220
There's more disappointing stuff for today.

07:49.701 --> 07:50.482
What is it?

07:50.522 --> 07:53.164
The LT thing.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.325
Yeah.

07:55.165 --> 07:58.087
Well... Obvious.

07:58.187 --> 08:01.469
You know.

08:01.830 --> 08:01.970
What?

08:02.670 --> 08:02.911
What?

08:03.751 --> 08:04.792
There's been another...

08:06.054 --> 08:06.855
Pero Sighting.

08:07.135 --> 08:09.116
BAU BAU!

08:09.997 --> 08:12.858
Moco-chan, where was he seen this time?

08:13.119 --> 08:14.780
Well, let's take a look.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.481
De-den!

08:18.242 --> 08:19.123
BAU BAU!

08:19.803 --> 08:20.964
That's beautiful.

08:22.604 --> 08:25.585
Nasty but beautiful!

08:25.785 --> 08:27.145
A beautiful cloud!

08:27.385 --> 08:29.506
Was it just about to get stormy there?

08:30.206 --> 08:32.667
You know, sometimes it sort of gets like that.

08:32.707 --> 08:38.869
Yeah, before it got stormy, you know, it started with a nice weather, then it just turned into a horrible rain.

08:39.449 --> 08:42.710
Hopefully it got blown away really fast, you know.

08:45.444 --> 08:46.905
Get in the way of your plans.

09:03.446 --> 09:04.687
Yeah.

09:04.907 --> 09:05.488
All your words.

09:05.929 --> 09:09.032
BAU BAU!

09:09.052 --> 09:09.392
BAU BAU!

09:09.412 --> 09:11.194
Sometimes Pero can do that, huh?

09:11.514 --> 09:12.795
Get in the way of your words!

09:12.815 --> 09:13.676
Yeah.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.418

09:16.159 --> 09:17.120

09:17.420 --> 09:18.381

09:18.401 --> 09:20.763
Oh, it's some good news!

09:20.863 --> 09:22.025
Ruffians!

09:22.745 --> 09:30.050
While our lovely demon of sound of hololive English -Advent-, Nerissa Ravencroft just released an MV for her original song, In My Feelings!

09:46.202 --> 09:47.083
It's the beginning of August!

09:47.103 --> 09:48.384
You might have already heard it!

09:48.824 --> 09:49.184
What?

09:49.624 --> 09:51.626
This is the perfect chance to go listen again!

09:51.646 --> 09:51.946
Yeah!

09:51.986 --> 09:56.188
Now we have a beautiful music video!

09:56.229 --> 09:58.710
The video is something else!

09:58.750 --> 10:00.171
It uses, you know, 3D.

10:00.211 --> 10:02.092
3D like real life!

10:02.132 --> 10:06.135
But you know, it just makes a better chance to really focus in on the lyrics.

10:06.275 --> 10:06.435
Yeah!

10:06.475 --> 10:09.757
To have a lot of feelings that Nerissa wrote herself!

10:09.777 --> 10:11.298
Nerissa wrote herself!

10:11.398 --> 10:15.701
You know, maybe it was written towards

10:18.053 --> 10:18.533
I don't know.

10:19.254 --> 10:20.675
Jailbreak?

10:20.695 --> 10:22.597
Kind of a sad song though, Nerissa.

10:22.677 --> 10:24.279
It's so sad though.

10:24.679 --> 10:26.701
You have to take a look and think about it!

10:27.662 --> 10:28.903
Yeah, take a listen too.

10:30.331 --> 10:32.492
And then, think about your feelings.

10:33.252 --> 10:37.934
And then maybe you'll be in your feelings together with Nerissa-chan.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.755
What's the art?

10:39.855 --> 10:43.738
The art of the video is done by the wonderful Yomousaka-sensei!

10:43.858 --> 10:49.621
Please take a look, there's some very cute illustrations of Nerissa.

10:49.661 --> 10:51.982
She has a cute outfit, you know?

10:52.002 --> 10:54.883
Blue white shirt and black skirt.

10:54.963 --> 10:57.405
And you can see her wings so nicely!

10:58.365 --> 11:00.587
Fuzzy Wings.

11:00.788 --> 11:04.731
Let's go take a whistle, okay?

11:04.751 --> 11:07.774
You know, supporting original music.

11:07.974 --> 11:08.435
Advent.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.777
All the music releases, you know.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.719
Releasing original music.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.501
It's very difficult.

11:15.561 --> 11:16.923
It's not a given, okay?

11:17.063 --> 11:19.145
And we put so much of ourselves into it.

11:19.165 --> 11:20.226
It's very personal.

11:20.406 --> 11:22.869
So please go have a listen, okay?

11:23.369 --> 11:24.290
You always do.

11:24.571 --> 11:30.777
BAU BAU, thank you!

11:30.797 --> 11:33.580
Speaking of original music...

11:34.981 --> 11:36.642
FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:36.662 --> 11:38.404
FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:53.474 --> 11:56.776
Welcome to the anime Isekai Suicide Squad!

11:56.796 --> 12:01.298
And you know, this music video, it's fully animated by Rit Studio!

12:01.378 --> 12:01.758
Yeah!

12:01.819 --> 12:03.139
Just like the anime!

12:03.399 --> 12:03.860
It's amazing!

12:03.900 --> 12:05.320
Look at Calli-senpai!

12:05.380 --> 12:05.500
Yes!

12:05.521 --> 12:06.621
Okay, Moco-chan.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.303
You know they're perfectly positioned here.

12:09.323 --> 12:12.344
Harley Quinn or Calli-senpai.

12:12.424 --> 12:13.525
Who is the waifu?

12:15.342 --> 12:16.922
You couldn't make me say that.

12:16.942 --> 12:20.143
What do you think, Ruffians?

12:20.183 --> 12:21.924
Who's the waifu?

12:22.084 --> 12:22.504
Huh?

12:23.024 --> 12:23.624
Huh?

12:25.865 --> 12:26.025
Huh?

12:27.726 --> 12:28.466
Oof!

12:29.146 --> 12:29.626
Oof!

12:29.666 --> 12:30.807
Hi!

12:31.427 --> 12:33.928
I have oof for singing the morning!

12:35.208 --> 12:36.528
Calli, it's the dog!

12:36.548 --> 12:39.109
That is true, but dog could be a waifu too!

12:39.169 --> 12:41.810
Can dog be a waifu?

12:48.609 --> 12:52.853
I don't see many answers.

12:53.253 --> 12:55.095
Ruffians, you're not gonna help out Moco-chan!

12:55.115 --> 12:58.077
I think YouTube is so many answers!

12:58.718 --> 12:59.739
Cali is the Hialeah!

12:59.959 --> 13:00.799
That's the answer!

13:00.819 --> 13:02.641
Cali is the Hialeah!

13:02.661 --> 13:02.821
Yes!

13:06.404 --> 13:07.144
BAU BAU!

13:07.204 --> 13:18.008
But in this music video, you can see both Harley Quinn and Calliope by dancing together in two different universes.

13:18.569 --> 13:22.430
I think wild things would happen if the worlds accidentally collided.

13:22.490 --> 13:25.131
It's probably best like that!

13:27.592 --> 13:30.395
Ruffians, the video is so amazing!

13:30.415 --> 13:37.421
That even just after a few hours, it's already at over 1 million views!

13:37.441 --> 13:39.583
1 million!

13:40.003 --> 13:44.588
Congratulations, everyone!

13:44.628 --> 13:47.130
That's so so happy for me!

13:47.190 --> 13:49.232
That's amazing!

13:49.312 --> 13:50.193
Go getters!

13:50.293 --> 13:52.255
Go getting the million viewers!

13:53.155 --> 13:56.356
Yeah, we're so happy for her!

13:56.396 --> 14:07.719
Yeah, you know, I'm sure it's so many hololive members' dream to sing an anime song and I can't cheer for Kelly-san, but it is such an amazing song and amazing music video too.

14:07.839 --> 14:08.059
Right?

14:08.099 --> 14:14.561
Yeah, she has a music video where she's moving together almost in the same world all together with everyone.

14:14.601 --> 14:15.281
Yeah, anime girl!

14:15.921 --> 14:19.786
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.883
Do listen, do not listen!

14:40.243 --> 14:41.725
Which one is it, Moco-chan?

14:41.745 --> 14:42.105
Do listen!

14:42.566 --> 14:44.948
Make sure you do listen!

14:45.128 --> 14:46.309
Dad or waifu?

14:46.710 --> 14:47.510
Which one, Moco-chan?

14:47.530 --> 14:49.492
Listen, don't listen!

14:49.853 --> 14:50.714
No more oof!

14:51.174 --> 14:52.235
No more oof!

14:52.295 --> 14:53.056
No more oof!

14:53.857 --> 14:55.178
Go listen, okay?

14:55.979 --> 14:56.679
Go listen.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.680
Go get the listen.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.994
BAU BAU!

15:03.414 --> 15:05.357
I'm not waking up, okay Ruffians?

15:05.477 --> 15:06.078
I'm not.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.179
Yeah.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.541
Got it?

15:08.621 --> 15:08.821
No.

15:09.261 --> 15:10.823
You're the one who's waking up.

15:11.204 --> 15:12.005
Good morning!

15:12.205 --> 15:12.806
Waking up?

15:12.846 --> 15:13.166
Waking up.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.390
BAU BAU!

15:17.770 --> 15:20.831
I hope you like music, Ruffians!

15:21.112 --> 15:23.033
Because!

15:23.153 --> 15:28.155
You know we talked about Nerissa, I generally talked about Kai-senpai and Senpai.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.716
Next, we get to talk about our kohai, Lauda!

15:35.078 --> 15:40.600
hololive English -Justice- just released their second cover song!

15:40.660 --> 15:41.500
BAU BAU!

15:41.940 --> 15:42.840
ECHO!

15:42.980 --> 15:44.961
It's a Vocaloid Goonies song!

15:44.981 --> 15:46.661
It's a classic!

15:46.681 --> 15:47.502
Did you listen?

15:47.622 --> 15:50.202
It's just came out fresh!

15:52.743 --> 15:57.145
Iyana did such an amazing job!

15:57.325 --> 16:00.467
You might have to thank someone special.

16:00.607 --> 16:07.770
Iyana didn't just do the singing, she also did the art too!

16:08.410 --> 16:09.410
Too amazing!

16:09.450 --> 16:11.371
She's too talented!

16:11.611 --> 16:11.731
Right!

16:16.523 --> 16:24.989
That means, Ruffians, that means you need to go and give our Koukai's brand new cover song a good listen, okay?

16:25.529 --> 16:28.992
She worked so hard on it!

16:29.472 --> 16:31.293
I'm just so proud of her!

16:31.734 --> 16:33.014
Koukai's down!

16:33.054 --> 16:34.115
BAU BAU!

16:34.415 --> 16:37.678
What do you think, Ruffians?

16:38.258 --> 16:42.201
Should we release a cover song with us doing the illustrations?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.533
What song would that be, Moco-chan?

16:47.553 --> 16:49.474
I don't know.

16:49.554 --> 16:55.976
Kaeru no uta ga kikoete kuru yo.

16:56.437 --> 16:56.757
BAU!

16:57.217 --> 16:57.557
BAU!

16:58.057 --> 16:58.377
BAU!

16:58.878 --> 16:59.218
BAU!

16:59.658 --> 17:00.878
Your frog is a good baller.

17:01.899 --> 17:02.119
Yes.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.060
Bye bye!

17:04.160 --> 17:07.441
Bye bye!

17:07.461 --> 17:08.141
You watch it.

17:09.402 --> 17:11.262
I think I could draw a picture of a frog.

17:11.282 --> 17:12.443
I think.

17:13.797 --> 17:16.580
That's a lot of confidence you got there.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.803
BAU BAU!

17:20.123 --> 17:22.165
BAU NEXT, RuffianS!

17:22.646 --> 17:23.506
It's the time!

17:23.567 --> 17:25.829
We're all excited!

17:26.149 --> 17:28.131
The regular quarter!

17:28.491 --> 17:30.313
Do you know what quarter that is, Ruffians?

17:30.333 --> 17:32.335
Do you know what the new regular quarter is?

17:32.675 --> 17:34.497
New regular quarter?

17:36.615 --> 17:39.177
The Mondays used to be, you know, challenge yourself.

17:39.197 --> 17:39.797
They used to be that.

17:39.837 --> 17:41.178
Misunderstanding.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.220
No, it's a new regular corner, Ruffians.

17:45.001 --> 17:45.441
Yes!

17:45.982 --> 17:50.425
The new FUWAMOCO merch corner!

17:50.445 --> 17:52.606
BAU BAU!

17:52.766 --> 17:56.509
BAU BAU!

17:56.749 --> 18:00.412
Ruffians, you are feeling a little tired, aren't you?

18:00.592 --> 18:01.713
Maybe just a bit.

18:02.213 --> 18:03.734
Tired!

18:04.014 --> 18:04.214
Yeah.

18:04.234 --> 18:04.835
We get it.

18:04.855 --> 18:05.355
We get it.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.583
Just in case you wanted to know!

18:09.603 --> 18:14.367
You know we covered last time, you know we have a 3-day showcase celebration, right?

18:14.387 --> 18:18.490
You know, it's also a live record, so we talked about it quickly.

18:18.991 --> 18:23.515
But, now, there is new FUWAMOCO merch!

18:24.095 --> 18:24.976
Yeah!

18:25.316 --> 18:26.757
Right now, Ruffians!

18:27.057 --> 18:28.257
Let's take a look at it!

18:29.018 --> 18:29.998
Right now!

18:30.439 --> 18:33.020
It's hololive's 7th anniversary!

18:33.480 --> 18:40.004
And here at FUWAMOCO, we're here all together in our special party performance to celebrate!

18:40.024 --> 18:40.504
Yes!

18:40.684 --> 18:41.465
Yeah!

18:41.765 --> 18:47.768
And you can find us all together with everybody at anime store locations all across Japan!

18:47.808 --> 18:50.790
But you know, there are actually special displays!

18:51.130 --> 18:52.711
One-size-for-Moco panels,

18:53.091 --> 18:58.354
So that you can find the Ikebukuro anime on the 7th floor for the 7th anniversary.

18:58.474 --> 18:59.835
I'm sure they planned that.

18:59.915 --> 19:04.118
I'm sure, I'm sure.

19:04.198 --> 19:09.101
So if you have the time, please go take a photo with us, okay?

19:09.361 --> 19:10.662
They're party girls, aren't they?

19:10.702 --> 19:11.322
Wedding dresses.

19:11.383 --> 19:12.163
Party, party.

19:12.223 --> 19:13.384
It's like a wedding dress.

19:16.785 --> 19:29.650
During the 7th Anniversary Special, you can get Merchandise Account Badges, Acrylic Stamps, Keychains, Lucky 5 Accords, and much much more!

19:29.730 --> 19:36.092
So if you want to get your paws on them, please head over to animeokawawuffins!

19:36.952 --> 19:37.273
Yes.

19:37.773 --> 19:37.913
And.

19:38.314 --> 19:38.574
But.

19:39.255 --> 19:39.355
Uh.

19:40.116 --> 19:41.458
It doesn't just stop there!

19:41.478 --> 19:42.640
It doesn't stop there!

19:43.080 --> 19:50.270
Also brand new, newly available on the official hololive shop, we have fan name keychains!

19:50.490 --> 19:51.832
Ruffian keychains!

19:52.052 --> 19:53.072
Yes, more!

19:53.132 --> 19:57.854
Yeah, you can now grind yourself as a Ruffian wherever you go!

19:58.375 --> 20:01.276
Yeah, wherever you go you're a Ruffian.

20:01.316 --> 20:04.297
But now this keychain will remind you just in case.

20:04.317 --> 20:05.597
Just in case you forget!

20:05.637 --> 20:08.338
Yeah, and it reminds just like our logo!

20:08.479 --> 20:12.020
And I think it will look great on any itabag too!

20:12.040 --> 20:14.461
Okay, Ruffians.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.328
There's a lot of words.

20:18.528 --> 20:19.429
A lot of words!

20:19.529 --> 20:20.491
We understand.

20:21.252 --> 20:21.573
Yeah.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.115
We're surprised too, right?

20:23.135 --> 20:24.016
Yeah.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.979
It isn't a bit much right now.

20:28.115 --> 20:31.397
We won't let you forget, okay?

20:31.537 --> 20:35.880
If there's really, really, really something exciting

20:57.113 --> 20:58.494
Yeah, priority list.

20:59.175 --> 21:03.958
The thing is, I feel like there's too much for a priority list.

21:03.978 --> 21:06.880
There's a lot Ruffians.

21:07.781 --> 21:09.302
Yeah, but Ruffians!

21:10.137 --> 21:19.362
Please remember, you know, you choose what you think you're most excited for and what you want to put into your collection, okay?

21:19.843 --> 21:24.985
No, no, no, please make sure that you do not break the bank, okay?

21:25.246 --> 21:29.168
We really don't want you to feel stressed or anything like that, you know?

21:29.488 --> 21:32.590
We understand that it's been a lot recently, okay?

21:33.010 --> 21:34.951
This is supposed to be fun!

21:35.031 --> 21:36.652
You need to eat!

21:36.672 --> 21:37.813
You need to eat!

21:38.513 --> 21:44.517
It's supposed to be fun!

21:44.637 --> 21:45.378
Okay!

21:45.918 --> 21:46.538
Okay!

21:47.219 --> 21:48.499
Ruffians!

21:48.960 --> 21:50.060
We understand.

21:50.541 --> 21:51.902
We know what you're feeling.

21:51.922 --> 21:52.982
Okay.

21:53.322 --> 21:54.023
Food sandwich!

21:54.203 --> 21:55.924
Eat the food, Ruffians!

21:56.604 --> 21:57.605
Eat the food!

21:57.685 --> 21:59.566
Yeah, okay.

21:59.706 --> 22:00.667
We understand.

22:05.282 --> 22:10.066
We don't want you to be stressed, that's not what we want at all, okay?

22:10.407 --> 22:11.368
FUWAMOCO!

22:11.428 --> 22:15.211
We both have four letters, but... Both are important.

22:15.291 --> 22:15.551
BAU BAU!

22:15.571 --> 22:16.432
Can you eat acrylic?

22:16.572 --> 22:16.973
Uh, no.

22:17.453 --> 22:19.635
There's no nutrients in acrylic, okay?

22:20.056 --> 22:20.756
Remember that.

22:21.357 --> 22:21.657
Food.

22:22.077 --> 22:22.618
Acrylics.

22:23.370 --> 22:25.592
One has nutrients, one does not now.

22:25.832 --> 22:26.172
Okay?

22:27.073 --> 22:29.655
BAU BAU!

22:30.075 --> 22:33.818
Just know that we understand, okay Ruffians?

22:34.479 --> 22:35.560
It's a crazy pace.

22:35.900 --> 22:36.961
BAU BAU!

22:37.843 --> 22:39.944
FUWAMOCO Morning!

23:08.130 --> 23:13.815
Bye bye!

23:14.555 --> 23:21.401
You know, just like fan art, it's kind of another way that we can all have fun together and make something amazing!

23:21.761 --> 23:29.347
But one thing we noticed is that for FUWAMOCO, assets are pretty rare for some reason.

23:31.293 --> 23:33.774
But we like to use them if you like to make them fun.

23:33.794 --> 23:34.934
Okay, Ruffians?

23:35.274 --> 23:40.255
I'm not sure if you remember, there's a lot of Ruffians over there for our debut.

23:40.455 --> 23:48.037
But our hashtag #helpFWMC, is actually made just for these two, you know?

23:48.137 --> 23:52.398
You know the hashtag is for anything you think that could help us, including us.

23:52.578 --> 23:58.079
Yeah, you know, like, oh this could be helpful, oh this could be interesting, oh whatever.

23:58.639 --> 24:00.420
Do we have anything in mind?

24:29.455 --> 24:32.056
I wanna see lots of Ruffians thinking we'll be fun.

24:32.376 --> 24:34.957
What do you think would be fun?

24:35.737 --> 24:35.897
Okay.

24:36.317 --> 24:38.637
Sometimes there's technical limitations.

24:38.657 --> 24:40.278
But it should be okay.

24:40.298 --> 24:40.678
BAU BAU!

24:40.718 --> 24:40.958
Ruffians!

24:51.410 --> 24:54.513
You really wanna see a swimsuit on top of a jacket?

24:54.573 --> 24:55.053
On top of a jacket?

24:55.093 --> 24:55.874
On top of a jacket!

24:55.914 --> 24:57.275
Kinda doesn't really work, huh?

24:57.295 --> 24:57.635
Yeah?

24:57.675 --> 24:57.775
Yes!

25:09.011 --> 25:09.212
Yes!

25:11.354 --> 25:11.995
Hi!

25:12.616 --> 25:14.158
I don't know about the Ruffians.

25:14.218 --> 25:15.660
Ruffians are silly, huh?

25:15.940 --> 25:17.101
Something never change.

25:17.502 --> 25:17.963
Yeah.

25:18.203 --> 25:20.225
BAU BAU!

25:20.285 --> 25:22.929
We are Ruffians!

25:23.389 --> 25:24.391
FUWAMOCO!

25:24.471 --> 25:25.071
It's Monday!

25:26.453 --> 25:32.617
And, you know, we've been go go go going all day long.

25:33.237 --> 25:34.258
It's been a super busy day.

25:34.318 --> 25:36.579
We've been very good puppies.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.501
We've been so much.

25:38.821 --> 25:41.723
Hard at work all day.

25:41.863 --> 25:43.303
All day long.

25:43.564 --> 25:46.846
You know, even Mine and Channel have proud of us for being such role models.

25:46.966 --> 25:48.106
Yes, yes.

25:49.527 --> 25:52.769
And so you know, Ruffians, now here we are!

25:53.129 --> 26:01.454
Here to give you a big high five and pass that hardworking baton to you so that you can do your best today, okay?

26:01.574 --> 26:03.615
You can do your absolute best!

26:03.675 --> 26:05.436
You can get all those things done, okay?

26:05.456 --> 26:06.497
This is not a pup talk.

26:07.037 --> 26:08.838
But the day's just started, you know?

26:08.858 --> 26:10.399
Give it your all, okay?

26:12.540 --> 26:13.222
You can do it!

26:13.362 --> 26:16.489
All the possibilities, they're all within you!

26:16.609 --> 26:18.052
And you know, we know it's Monday.

26:18.072 --> 26:19.495
It's Ruffians.

26:20.923 --> 26:23.204
But we know, Ruffians, you can do it!

26:23.264 --> 26:24.944
You'll make us proud, okay?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.644
Here you are!

26:26.844 --> 26:28.245
Big high five!

26:28.725 --> 26:30.485
BAU BAU!

26:30.505 --> 26:32.446
Do your best, okay?

26:32.606 --> 26:36.187
BAU BAU!

26:36.227 --> 26:37.307
You can do it!

26:37.327 --> 26:38.827
You motivated!

26:39.607 --> 26:41.268
Your morning hasn't been very good?

26:41.648 --> 26:41.908
Wow.

26:42.748 --> 26:44.209
Here is the high five.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.550
So that is gonna be better, okay?

26:45.751 --> 26:47.952
It's gonna be better, okay, Ruffians?

26:48.873 --> 26:51.876
We blew the nasty Pero clouds out of the sky.

26:51.916 --> 26:53.897
Yeah, I'm too soft.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.519
It's still way down on our mouth.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.500
BAU BAU!

26:57.620 --> 26:59.822
BAU BAU!

26:59.862 --> 27:04.026
Let's take a look at some of our regular corners that aren't the merch corner.

27:04.947 --> 27:06.348
It's not a corner, Ruffians.

27:06.748 --> 27:08.209
It's not a corner, we're not joking.

27:09.290 --> 27:13.754
Let's take a look at what the Doggie of the Day is today!

27:16.075 --> 27:22.601
Today... Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

27:22.621 --> 27:27.845
This is our Doggie of the Day!

27:29.386 --> 27:30.226
I like this dog.

27:30.427 --> 27:30.567
But...

27:33.450 --> 27:34.514
He has no name!

27:34.594 --> 27:35.698
Yeah!

27:36.421 --> 27:37.364
Ruffians!

27:37.666 --> 27:39.171
We give him a name!

27:39.191 --> 27:39.492
Huh?

27:43.452 --> 27:45.013
I just saw Maya and his doggy.

27:45.074 --> 27:46.355
Very fluffy doggy.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.956
Very beautiful eyes.

27:48.076 --> 27:49.617
Yeah, those blue eyes.

27:49.678 --> 27:50.398
Yeah!

27:50.498 --> 27:52.880
Sort of like a certain someone, huh?

27:52.900 --> 27:53.161
Fluffy!

27:53.281 --> 27:53.681
Yeah!

27:53.701 --> 27:57.544
I feel like I have some white friends.

27:57.564 --> 27:59.446
This is a doggy I didn't know!

27:59.566 --> 28:00.107
Marvin!

28:00.367 --> 28:00.747
Marvin!

28:00.807 --> 28:01.027
Marvin!

28:01.047 --> 28:01.508
I like that.

28:02.128 --> 28:02.609
Marvin!

28:02.909 --> 28:03.209
Marvin!

28:03.269 --> 28:03.790
Marvin!

28:03.930 --> 28:04.270
Marvin!

28:04.310 --> 28:06.612
Today's Doggie of the Day is Marvin!

28:08.013 --> 28:09.854
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:34.038 --> 28:35.218
That's a Marvin.

28:35.919 --> 28:38.280
Marvin kind of sounds like a koto, no?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.900
A koto?

28:40.021 --> 28:41.721
A koto, right?

28:42.462 --> 28:47.344
Is that what a koto sounds like?

28:47.884 --> 28:54.127
A koto is a Japanese instrument.

28:54.347 --> 28:56.348
Marvin's kind of silly, huh?

28:57.745 --> 29:01.747
That's a unique doggy.

29:02.208 --> 29:13.673
Well, you know, Marvin is the Doggie of the Day that I like to just look at really nice and close to and just stick my head into all that fluff.

29:13.873 --> 29:16.355
It sure looks like there's enough of it for both of us.

29:17.635 --> 29:22.378
I think we can all agree this is a very good looking doggy.

29:24.150 --> 29:27.433
Maybe even yummy too.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.475
Maybe a bit.

29:29.155 --> 29:31.057
BAU BAU!

29:31.157 --> 29:32.659
Thank you, Moribun!

29:32.839 --> 29:34.141
BAU BAU!

29:34.361 --> 29:36.183
And for today, I went on a walk.

29:36.223 --> 29:37.144
What kind of go on a walk?

29:37.204 --> 29:38.565
Where did we go, Ruffians?

29:38.585 --> 29:39.907
We have de-den!

29:40.147 --> 29:41.388
Beautiful!

29:45.837 --> 29:47.577
It's a house hidden in plants.

29:47.757 --> 29:49.398
I love houses like this!

29:49.498 --> 29:54.659
You know, sometimes in the Northwest, passagees come across them, too!

29:56.159 --> 30:00.300
Don't you always wonder what it'd be like living in there?

30:00.820 --> 30:04.481
I wanna be behind the window and just covering all the plants!

30:04.501 --> 30:08.222
Yeah, I feel like it'd almost be like you're being protected by them, right?

30:08.302 --> 30:09.282
Like a big hug!

30:09.602 --> 30:12.443
Yeah, it'd be kind of magical, wouldn't it?

30:12.463 --> 30:12.763
Allergies?

30:12.783 --> 30:13.563
Allergies!

30:13.963 --> 30:16.510
If you have allergies, that's not the place to be, huh?

30:16.871 --> 30:17.633
Is this Fauna Mart?

30:17.673 --> 30:17.934
Wow.

30:21.463 --> 30:22.686
We have life Fauna Mart.

30:23.638 --> 30:24.818
BAU BAU!

30:24.898 --> 30:28.659
Thank you for sharing this dumb show of your life with us!

30:28.879 --> 30:30.619
BAU BAU!

30:31.519 --> 30:35.040
And next, we have our Question of the Day.

30:35.180 --> 30:37.660
We have De-den!

30:38.061 --> 30:41.381
I enjoyed the new extreme love voice part!

30:41.401 --> 30:42.141
Thank you!

30:42.461 --> 30:46.302
I was wondering how it was decided that you would both be on it.

30:46.622 --> 30:50.343
I've always thought of Moco-chan as more of a tsundere character.

30:50.543 --> 30:52.383
Maybe you need to check yourself, huh?

30:53.577 --> 30:54.618
I don't know.

30:55.278 --> 31:03.983
Ruffians, isn't everyone a little yandere sometimes?

31:04.144 --> 31:05.364
Moco-chan!

31:05.745 --> 31:08.566
Moco-chan's pretty tsund tsund, actually.

31:09.407 --> 31:10.027
And me!

31:10.047 --> 31:12.489
I think I'm pretty dere dere, right?

31:16.775 --> 31:20.158
I don't know, is it that interesting that we just kind of stayed the same?

31:20.178 --> 31:23.621
Yeah, we have to be different, right?

31:23.661 --> 31:27.604
I was thinking that we could just become good at it.

31:27.644 --> 31:29.566
That's kind of hard though, you know.

31:29.586 --> 31:34.711
We just kind of get too excited when we're with you.

31:34.751 --> 31:35.992
We get too excited, huh?

31:36.372 --> 31:38.054
Do you want to play a game today?

31:38.722 --> 31:43.090
This sounds more frightening like a horror game.

31:43.631 --> 31:46.096
I'm here to protect your smile.

31:47.701 --> 31:49.221
I thought it was Yandere!

31:49.301 --> 31:50.402
No, it's not!

31:50.462 --> 31:52.522
That's my best clue, dere.

31:52.602 --> 31:57.363
Maybe it's... Maybe it's message of Yandere heart.

31:58.164 --> 31:59.244
Maybe.

32:00.204 --> 32:03.265
Yeah, I just wanted to give you an easier choice.

32:03.845 --> 32:04.725
BAU BAU!

32:05.386 --> 32:07.426
Maybe that's why.

32:07.486 --> 32:08.786
Well, there's your answer.

32:08.986 --> 32:09.407
Yeah.

32:09.887 --> 32:10.647
I'm Mofin.

32:11.447 --> 32:13.028
Better watch out, okay?

32:13.409 --> 32:16.291
Check out my new voice pack!

32:16.411 --> 32:19.213
And watch out because Halloween is approaching, too!

32:19.273 --> 32:20.854
It is approaching, huh?

32:21.074 --> 32:21.234
Yeah.

32:21.715 --> 32:22.415
Sooner than later!

32:22.475 --> 32:23.376
Sooner than later!

32:23.416 --> 32:24.737
BAU BAU!

32:25.237 --> 32:29.600
And Ruffians, thank you so much for all your submissions!

32:30.221 --> 32:34.664
Please, you know, we love to have you part of this journey!

32:34.684 --> 32:36.765
Moco-chan, you're breaking the camera!

32:37.346 --> 32:39.047
It's just temporary pause.

32:41.189 --> 32:44.151
So, please send us your Doggie of the Day!

32:44.411 --> 32:48.073
You know, send us a little snapshot into your daily life, Ruffians!

32:48.113 --> 32:49.234
Show us your walks!

32:49.975 --> 32:51.956
Send us your questions!

32:52.476 --> 32:56.759
And if you happen to see Pero, send us the misfortune of the sighting.

32:56.779 --> 32:57.840
Okay?

32:57.860 --> 33:01.222
Please let us know with the hashtag!

33:01.523 --> 33:02.123
Hashtag!

33:02.663 --> 33:05.025
FWMCMORNING!

33:05.045 --> 33:08.828
Ruffians, you know, we haven't forgotten about the hashtag.

33:09.468 --> 33:11.249
FWMCScoop2.

33:11.409 --> 33:19.552
You know, if you have any new interesting news, hololive hololive tips, please let us know, okay?

33:19.612 --> 33:21.113
BAU BAU!

33:21.313 --> 33:22.674
Thank you, Mofurians!

33:23.174 --> 33:28.036
And for our next stream, we have... De-den!

33:28.056 --> 33:29.456
Donkey Kong 2!

33:29.496 --> 33:38.240
Today we're gonna take a little bit of a break from... Well... I have to... Oh my god.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.152
A lot of work.

33:41.192 --> 33:42.533
Yeah.

33:42.713 --> 33:44.595
According to practice.

33:45.235 --> 33:48.257
But we might get a little bit of a rest.

33:48.517 --> 33:49.257
Yeah.

33:49.518 --> 33:49.858
Yeah.

33:50.018 --> 33:50.278
Yeah.

33:50.638 --> 33:53.220
Get our homework done so we can go to sleep early!

33:53.380 --> 33:53.900
Yeah!

33:54.141 --> 33:54.881
Alright!

33:55.441 --> 33:58.603
And then we'll have even more fun playing Donkey Kong Country 2 together!

33:58.643 --> 33:58.803
Yes!

33:58.924 --> 34:00.104
Okay, we'll see!

34:00.204 --> 34:00.845
Okay!

34:01.545 --> 34:03.586
Has this nest been able to get some sleep?

34:03.947 --> 34:04.127
No.

34:05.107 --> 34:05.908
Why didn't it?

34:07.977 --> 34:08.938
BAU BAU!

34:09.498 --> 34:10.479
BAU BAU!

34:10.519 --> 34:12.321
Let's take a peek at our schedule.

34:12.401 --> 34:13.682
Our schedule!

34:13.882 --> 34:14.082
Yes!

34:14.863 --> 34:18.466
Well, this week, you know, we're up to a bunch of different things.

34:18.626 --> 34:21.668
A lot of recreating, a lot of practice, a lot of stuff.

34:22.489 --> 34:27.834
But on Wednesday, we'll have FUWAMOCO Morning, so we'll be able to see you bright and early once more.

34:28.234 --> 34:33.078
And on Thursday, we're playing the brand new game from Hulu, Indie, Elite Exorcist

34:33.198 --> 34:35.039
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

34:35.059 --> 34:38.442
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

34:38.502 --> 34:41.284
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

34:41.304 --> 34:43.305
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

34:43.525 --> 34:45.507
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

34:45.547 --> 34:47.748
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.399
I do know summer's coming to a close.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.100
I feel like there's still a lot of summer.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.401
I feel like there's still a lot of energy.

35:09.421 --> 35:12.063
Let's hold out summer together, okay, love feelings?

35:12.423 --> 35:15.804
And then, Sunday, we're gonna go to the bathhouse.

35:15.864 --> 35:16.965
Our store bathhouse.

35:17.505 --> 35:18.666
B-bathhouse.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.046
B-bathhouse.

35:20.166 --> 35:20.967
B-bath.

35:21.387 --> 35:21.767
Yeah.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.668
Maybe some BAU BAU here and there, too.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.069
Yeah.

35:25.089 --> 35:25.909
Nice!

35:26.029 --> 35:26.689
Oh, and Zen!

35:27.050 --> 35:27.370
Yeah.

35:27.590 --> 35:28.090
No go.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.951
Nothing's gonna surprise us, no.

35:31.824 --> 35:34.305
Announce this week's schedule!

35:34.746 --> 35:37.507
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

35:37.567 --> 35:40.908
For Ruffians joining us through the archive today too!

35:41.329 --> 35:43.369
Here is your FUWAMOCO word!

35:43.710 --> 35:45.030
It's BAU BAU!

35:45.130 --> 35:46.311
BAUTIFUL MERCH!

35:47.171 --> 35:48.872
BAU BAU!

35:49.953 --> 35:56.317
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:56.697 --> 35:58.799
Do your best to sleep well today!

35:58.819 --> 36:00.060
You can do it!

36:00.540 --> 36:07.365
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

36:07.925 --> 36:08.986
