05:03.890 --> 05:06.400
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:06.503 --> 05:10.204
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:10.224 --> 05:12.684
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:13.424 --> 05:17.826
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:17.926 --> 05:19.906
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:27.768 --> 05:33.412
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:33.432 --> 05:38.716
Thank you for joining us today for our 16th episode!

05:42.841 --> 05:44.701
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

05:45.742 --> 05:55.026
For Ruffians that are maybe tuning in for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

05:55.246 --> 05:55.826
A.K.A.

05:55.906 --> 05:56.606
FUWAMOCO!

05:56.966 --> 06:00.548
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:00.868 --> 06:02.849
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

06:03.209 --> 06:05.930
and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:06.330 --> 06:12.711
Ruffians, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:12.992 --> 06:15.512
Never quite get it, huh?

06:16.112 --> 06:19.373
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new morning!

06:19.393 --> 06:20.753
What type of morning?

06:20.773 --> 06:23.994
A brand new... FUWAMOCO morning.

06:24.154 --> 06:24.734
Yes!

06:24.915 --> 06:30.376
A brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

06:31.789 --> 06:32.990
Well, Ruffians.

06:34.370 --> 06:34.871
Guess what?

06:35.891 --> 06:39.333
There's another Ruffian who's seen Pero.

06:40.194 --> 06:43.475
Yeah, this time... Where?

06:44.436 --> 06:44.976
Where, Moco-chan?

06:45.016 --> 06:48.818
He's in the kitchen!

06:48.878 --> 06:49.799
The kitchen?

06:51.039 --> 06:55.262
It looks like this Ruffian was putting lots of love into making ponderings.

06:55.342 --> 06:59.224
At least, attempting a very good attempt at making ponderings.

07:01.775 --> 07:06.101
I feel like this must be one of the bravest, the most brave Ruffians ever.

07:06.142 --> 07:07.724
The bravest, the most brave.

07:08.485 --> 07:10.868
In case you didn't understand bravest.

07:11.389 --> 07:15.635
Ruffians, you know, it's probably best...

07:16.736 --> 07:22.781
It may be a bit tempting, but you know, don't try to make ponderings at home, okay?

07:23.181 --> 07:27.804
Not unless you have some very strong fire resistance magic.

07:27.904 --> 07:30.206
Yeah, it can be a bit perilous.

07:30.226 --> 07:33.788
This is why Mister Donut is obviously the best.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.211
Because you don't need to make them if you can buy them.

07:38.552 --> 07:42.174
Ponderings, you know, they seem easy to make in theory,

07:43.155 --> 07:50.147
Actually, they're really tricky and a bit dangerous to try to make.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.611
Please don't burn down your house trying to make them.

07:53.673 --> 07:57.339
But I guess you know, maybe if you see Pero there, then it's okay.

08:01.079 --> 08:08.686
We don't dislike Pero that much.

08:09.206 --> 08:12.449
I don't know if we can say that we like him, but we don't dislike him that much.

08:12.469 --> 08:14.231
Yeah, we wouldn't want him to burn to death.

08:14.551 --> 08:17.633
Yeah, we definitely know it speaking from experience.

08:17.653 --> 08:18.334
Yeah, yeah.

08:32.884 --> 08:34.705
Yeah, hopefully you enjoyed them.

08:34.725 --> 08:40.047
And maybe without Pero swallowing any between blanks or something.

08:40.127 --> 08:41.088
And no fire.

08:41.608 --> 08:42.328
No danger.

08:42.368 --> 08:43.589
No danger, no burns.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.350
BAU BAU!

08:46.410 --> 08:47.630
Thank you!

08:47.650 --> 08:51.552
Please, Ruffians, let us know if you see Pero around, okay?

08:51.632 --> 08:55.494
Remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING if you see her.

08:56.414 --> 08:56.854
BAU BAU!

08:56.874 --> 08:57.855
Thank you!

08:58.355 --> 08:59.355
Enjoy the yummies.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.937
Ah, pondering sounds good right now, right?

09:03.957 --> 09:04.317
Ah, right!

09:04.337 --> 09:05.917
A good way to start the morning, right?

09:05.957 --> 09:07.097
Yeah!

09:07.117 --> 09:10.478
Is it?

09:11.098 --> 09:11.398
Is it?

09:12.378 --> 09:12.879
What's wrong?

09:13.199 --> 09:14.719
Is it that kind of time, Moco-chan?

09:15.039 --> 09:15.639
Time for what?

09:16.099 --> 09:17.600
I think it's time for that.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.580
Ruffians!

09:20.700 --> 09:22.901
There's been a misunderstanding.

09:22.961 --> 09:27.082
Something you know that Moco-chan needs to kind of clear up, I think.

09:27.222 --> 09:27.302
Me?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.222
Yeah, you, Moco-chan.

09:30.128 --> 09:36.572
You know... There's something on my mind.

09:36.592 --> 09:38.433
On Moco-chan's mind.

09:38.473 --> 09:39.874
It should be on your mind too, Moco-chan.

09:39.894 --> 09:40.854
Is it on my mind?

09:40.874 --> 09:41.455
Yeah.

09:41.775 --> 09:42.775
What is in my mind?

09:42.996 --> 09:45.957
About, you know, a dear album member.

09:45.977 --> 09:46.017
So...

09:49.042 --> 09:57.787
I saw that there were some ruffians were concerned about how Moco-chan talked to Nerissa during a recent collab in Pico Park.

09:58.727 --> 10:03.210
Yeah, Moco-chan, you said that you were going to clean Nerissa up because she was dirty.

10:03.230 --> 10:09.073
Moco-chan, what do you have to say about this?

10:15.296 --> 10:16.237
No reaction?

10:17.430 --> 10:18.031
I don't know.

10:19.112 --> 10:19.872
Was I wrong?

10:19.892 --> 10:22.694
It's not wrong.

10:23.615 --> 10:25.336
Is it really a misunderstanding?

10:27.298 --> 10:28.399
Ruffians, what do you think?

10:28.639 --> 10:29.079
It's bad.

10:29.259 --> 10:29.880
It's not good.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.601
I did nothing wrong, right?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.444
The whistle... The whistle's not dirty.

10:36.545 --> 10:36.825
What?

10:37.226 --> 10:40.368
You don't... You don't actually think the whistle's dirty, do you, Ruffians?

10:40.388 --> 10:40.989
Mococo is right!

10:41.309 --> 10:42.250
Mococo is right!

10:42.270 --> 10:43.270
Yeah.

10:49.281 --> 10:49.681
No!

10:50.022 --> 10:51.723
No, Moco-chan, you... No.

10:52.784 --> 10:53.304
I'm correct.

10:53.644 --> 10:54.005
No.

10:54.205 --> 10:54.425
Yeah.

10:54.845 --> 10:55.065
No!

10:55.125 --> 10:57.267
I'm gonna purify her!

10:57.607 --> 11:01.030
Purify the demon of sound!

11:01.830 --> 11:05.313
Get rid of the nasty demon that's inside of her!

11:05.333 --> 11:07.835
Moco-chan, you know what demons do?

11:10.116 --> 11:12.798
I think Mococo could cure her of her dirtiness!

11:12.938 --> 11:13.239
Yeah!

11:13.779 --> 11:15.180
I'm here to help you, Nerissa!

11:15.260 --> 11:16.941
Morning deshita.

11:18.790 --> 11:22.273
Now Moco-chan, you're referring to yourself as Mococo.

11:22.593 --> 11:23.414
Third person.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.696
If I'm gonna clean her, then yes.

11:27.697 --> 11:29.199
Watch out, Nerissa.

11:29.219 --> 11:31.240
Moco-chan took your duty.

11:31.260 --> 11:32.501
You're welcome!

11:33.602 --> 11:35.083
Was that an apology at all, Moco-chan?

11:35.183 --> 11:37.025
If it wasn't a misunderstanding.

11:39.166 --> 11:39.507
Was it?

11:39.767 --> 11:40.688
Sorry, Nerissa.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.491
Wow!

11:43.871 --> 11:47.054
There's actually been something else on our minds.

11:47.634 --> 11:49.856
Maybe something we wanted to confess a bit.

11:51.397 --> 11:52.077
Ruffians.

11:53.558 --> 12:00.363
You know, this time, we have something we'd like to confess about a senpai in particular.

12:00.383 --> 12:05.487
We all know she's very, very cool.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.336
We have a lot of very cool senpai.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.516
We do, we do.

12:12.876 --> 12:20.038
But recently when we think of this senpai, we even get a bit teary because she's just that cool!

12:20.098 --> 12:21.098
Oh, maybe it's just you.

12:21.938 --> 12:23.119
I would never get teary.

12:23.139 --> 12:25.339
Mococo-chan's just saying that.

12:25.359 --> 12:26.660
Ruffians, can you guess?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.000
Can you guess?

12:30.558 --> 12:34.823
I think she's definitely gonna think we're weird for this.

12:35.483 --> 12:35.624
Oh!

12:36.144 --> 12:36.284
Oh!

12:36.765 --> 12:36.905
Oh!

12:37.005 --> 12:37.486
I see it!

12:38.407 --> 12:39.608
There's a lot of Senpai.

12:39.868 --> 12:40.709
There's a lot of Senpai.

12:43.587 --> 12:46.310
It's Calli-senpai!

12:46.390 --> 12:48.391
Moco-chan, thank you for the drawing.

12:48.451 --> 12:49.292
You're welcome.

12:49.772 --> 12:50.573
It's very good.

12:51.334 --> 12:52.275
Exactly the same.

12:52.315 --> 12:56.238
Yeah, you know, Calli-senpai's super busy, right?

12:56.258 --> 13:05.046
You know, she has her new EP, Jigoku 6, that just came out, and has been on a bunch of TV shows and music TV shows recently.

13:05.086 --> 13:09.409
But despite her busy schedule, she still makes time for us and Abyss.

13:10.290 --> 13:10.570
BAU BAU!

13:10.590 --> 13:10.970
BAU BAU!

13:10.990 --> 13:11.290
BAU BAU!

13:11.350 --> 13:11.690
BAU BAU!

13:11.750 --> 13:11.931
BAU BAU!

13:40.239 --> 13:49.545
To be completely honest, it's not like we've been talking a bunch together through DMs because FUWAMOCO, you know, we have a hard time getting the courage from it, right?

13:49.785 --> 13:52.407
But this is still how we feel inside.

13:52.627 --> 13:53.728
It's tough, you know?

13:54.348 --> 13:56.070
And you know what too?

13:56.090 --> 14:00.633
With FUWAMOCO, we were having a bit of a rough day the other day.

14:00.653 --> 14:04.835
Calli-senpai, she said that she lent us a copy of

14:05.956 --> 14:09.437
Her game that we were having a really hard time getting.

14:09.477 --> 14:11.878
Well, not her game, but our game, she has.

14:12.018 --> 14:12.758
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:13.098 --> 14:15.599
You know, and that meant so much to us.

14:15.719 --> 14:18.700
It's just, it's just maybe like a little thing.

14:18.740 --> 14:19.880
Yeah, she didn't need to.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.281
Right?

14:21.321 --> 14:22.381
But it was very nice.

14:22.581 --> 14:23.021
Right?

14:23.281 --> 14:28.243
You know, we're kind of thinking that, Ruffians, do you know the rules of Versailles?

14:28.263 --> 14:31.344
Do you know the legendary rules of Versailles?

14:32.156 --> 14:35.057
I feel like Calli-senpai is a bit like Oscar.

14:35.257 --> 14:35.477
Yeah.

14:35.857 --> 14:36.377
You know?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.157
That's our thought.

14:37.277 --> 14:37.917
Yeah.

14:38.057 --> 14:41.338
She looks pretty similar the way I do her.

14:41.918 --> 14:43.878
But you know Calli-senpai's very cool.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.278
Very, very cool.

14:45.558 --> 14:49.399
Wanting to put herself in danger to protect those important.

14:49.499 --> 14:50.679
You know?

14:51.039 --> 14:52.259
Just like Oscar!

14:53.080 --> 14:53.840
In danger.

14:53.940 --> 14:54.680
Yeah.

14:55.340 --> 14:56.400
That's our senpai.

14:57.420 --> 14:57.900
Danger.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.121
Dangerous.

14:59.821 --> 15:01.361
Like, giving a game.

15:01.881 --> 15:02.802
Very dangerous.

15:05.783 --> 15:06.864
BAU BAU!

15:06.944 --> 15:09.385
That's what we wanted to confess.

15:10.025 --> 15:13.927
Well, Ruffians.

15:14.187 --> 15:18.370
We also heard that it's a new time of year.

15:18.630 --> 15:19.970
It's that time of year.

15:20.511 --> 15:22.932
It's back to school!

15:23.172 --> 15:24.553
Back to school season.

15:26.167 --> 15:33.536
We really wanted to give a big BAU BAU to any Ruffians who are returning back to school to continue their studies.

15:33.656 --> 15:35.619
We're sure it's really rough on it.

15:35.699 --> 15:44.349
New class, new faces, new strict teachers, and worst of all, mountains of homework and texts to read.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.466
But Ruffians, you can do it!

15:47.666 --> 15:47.966
Yeah!

15:48.046 --> 15:48.767
Hang in there!

15:48.787 --> 15:48.907
Yeah!

15:49.107 --> 15:53.808
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've done a lot of training as Demon Guard Dogs.

15:54.048 --> 15:56.388
And you know, it was really rough.

15:56.808 --> 15:57.808
Really rough.

15:58.409 --> 16:09.751
Yeah, we still always have more training to do, but... You know, Ruffians, we take you on, but we found something more important to protect right now.

16:09.891 --> 16:10.531
Right!

16:10.591 --> 16:10.891
Right.

16:10.931 --> 16:12.212
Protect you.

16:12.312 --> 16:12.692
Yeah.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.152
I think we've done enough training.

16:15.285 --> 16:18.569
You may be a little bit surprised.

16:35.147 --> 16:36.168
We are pretty good at it.

16:36.268 --> 16:37.748
Yeah, we did learn that stuff.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.089
Yeah, very studious.

16:39.149 --> 16:44.291
You know, we never made any excuses like, teacher the dog ate our homework!

16:44.351 --> 16:45.211
Yeah, yeah.

16:45.311 --> 16:50.773
And we never, you know, Moco-chan never switched spots and did my test or something.

16:50.833 --> 16:51.354
You know?

16:51.374 --> 16:54.075
Yeah, we're good students.

16:54.255 --> 16:54.795
Even math.

16:55.495 --> 16:55.835
Even math.

16:58.034 --> 17:01.898
I cried a lot while I was doing math.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.380
But yeah, math.

17:05.001 --> 17:07.804
And even though it was really hard, it wasn't good.

17:07.824 --> 17:11.047
It felt, you know, kind of just like prison.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.189
Just like we were in the cell.

17:16.344 --> 17:18.125
It makes us feel a bit sick.

17:18.285 --> 17:19.325
Just thinking about it.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.706
Not great.

17:21.806 --> 17:31.450
So, we really wanted to give a big support of BAU BAU to all the Ruffians doing their best to improve themselves and learn as much as they can!

17:31.550 --> 17:32.111
Ruffians!

17:32.391 --> 17:33.451
You can do it!

17:33.591 --> 17:34.532
BAU BAU!

17:34.612 --> 17:37.473
Get on the school bus!

17:37.833 --> 17:39.314
Up to the school bus!

17:39.394 --> 17:41.795
It's time to go to school!

17:42.675 --> 17:43.355
BAU BAU!

17:43.395 --> 17:44.996
Good luck!

17:45.578 --> 17:46.519
Good luck!

17:48.161 --> 17:48.962
Going to school!

17:49.662 --> 17:50.263
Going to school!

17:50.283 --> 17:51.204
They're on the bus now.

17:52.085 --> 17:52.846
They're going.

17:52.866 --> 17:54.948
Ruffians, you know what?

17:55.028 --> 17:55.288
I think

18:08.260 --> 18:16.054
It's another special FUWAMOCO Morning because we have some very special FUWAMOCO Morning Jingles!

18:20.365 --> 18:22.465
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

18:22.966 --> 18:35.190
A week ago, we asked Ruffians to come up with their very best jingles so we could all have a special jingle that we can love lots and lots for FUWAMOCO Morning!

18:36.291 --> 18:43.574
Once again, we really want to say a big thank you to every Ruffian for the jingles that they made just for FUWAMOCO Morning.

18:43.974 --> 18:48.416
Each and every one has filled us with so much passion and individuality.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.378
Moco-chan, shall we take a listen?

18:51.478 --> 18:52.118
Is it okay?

19:12.367 --> 19:12.607
Okay.

19:13.087 --> 19:15.549
But Ruffians, remember you have to be like this, okay?

19:15.569 --> 19:17.409
You have to really get into it.

19:17.449 --> 19:17.890
Got it?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.771
Listen very closely, okay?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.672
Get ready to dance a bit.

19:22.932 --> 19:23.252
Yeah.

19:23.392 --> 19:24.973
Okay.

19:25.673 --> 19:27.154
Let's see.

19:27.974 --> 19:29.675
Who's this first jingle from?

19:30.816 --> 19:37.599
This one is a jingle from... Bo... Ed!

19:37.739 --> 19:38.359
Let's listen!

19:39.100 --> 19:39.460
De-den!

19:46.944 --> 19:48.384
It's so cute!

19:48.404 --> 19:50.665
They said they used an instrument called a Kuika.

19:51.886 --> 19:52.686
I've never heard of it.

19:52.766 --> 19:53.667
I know, right?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.448
It's so cute and mysterious.

19:57.088 --> 19:59.869
It has a puppy vibe to it, right?

19:59.969 --> 20:04.071
Yeah, I feel like it has a puppy sort of feel.

20:04.131 --> 20:05.812
Not Donkey Kong.

20:05.892 --> 20:06.832
Donkey Kong?

20:07.252 --> 20:07.753
I don't know.

20:09.054 --> 20:11.296
FUWAMOCO's gonna come and get you!

20:11.336 --> 20:13.858
We're gonna put a smile on your face!

20:14.198 --> 20:14.658
I like it.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.281
You know, we're definitely up to something again this morning.

20:18.361 --> 20:20.844
It's silly.

20:21.324 --> 20:21.984
Thank you!

20:22.985 --> 20:24.567
BAU BAU!

20:25.407 --> 20:29.531
And next, we have a jingle from Ugokubo.

20:29.551 --> 20:30.431
Ugokubo-san.

20:30.732 --> 20:31.632
Let's listen!

20:41.969 --> 20:44.891
It has a bit of a futuristic feel to it.

20:45.311 --> 20:49.354
But it's really cute and it has a refreshing feel.

20:49.394 --> 20:53.136
It feels like carbonated water.

20:53.176 --> 21:06.865
For me, I feel like it reminds me a bit of when you just finish installing and starting up a visual novel for the first time and you take a look at the game menu.

21:06.925 --> 21:09.787
You see all the heroines and there's the bright blue sky.

21:10.888 --> 21:12.830
Next, we have a jingle from Tiana!

21:12.850 --> 21:13.391
Let's listen!

21:39.813 --> 21:46.639
Moco-chan, apparently this jingle is done in a genuine PC-98 format!

21:46.979 --> 21:49.182
I like it!

21:49.342 --> 21:49.922
I like it!

21:49.942 --> 21:50.483
Amazing!

21:50.643 --> 21:51.384
Impressive!

21:53.528 --> 21:55.050
I get too many good feelings.

21:55.511 --> 21:59.074
It hits you in the bones.

21:59.114 --> 22:03.539
A blanket that I've had for many, many, many thousands of years.

22:04.580 --> 22:10.947
I don't think we talked about this before, but FUWAMOCO, we really, really love the PC-98.

22:12.609 --> 22:20.170
It's one of our dreams to actually have a working PC-90 and be able to play classic visual novels on it.

22:20.250 --> 22:20.691
Someday!

22:20.731 --> 22:21.391
Someday.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.311
It's a bone blanket, yes.

22:23.591 --> 22:26.552
Right, the vibe is so good.

22:26.972 --> 22:27.652
Thank you!

22:27.672 --> 22:28.432
BAU BAU!

22:28.532 --> 22:32.233
BAU BAU!

22:32.333 --> 22:33.513
That was really cool.

22:33.973 --> 22:37.814
Well, this next submission is from Genji!

22:38.074 --> 22:39.034
Let's take a listen.

22:53.046 --> 22:55.828
This is a jingle played on the shamisen.

22:55.888 --> 22:58.870
Ruffians, do you know what the shamisen is?

23:01.352 --> 23:01.853
I wonder.

23:01.873 --> 23:05.675
It might be a lot of Ruffians' first time with a shamisen.

23:05.916 --> 23:10.579
A shamisen is a Japanese lute that's played by plucking three different strings with a...

23:12.295 --> 23:12.595
A thing.

23:12.915 --> 23:14.676
A thing called a bachi.

23:14.696 --> 23:17.237
Yeah, it's really really cool.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.098
They're so good at it too.

23:20.418 --> 23:24.559
I think it must be really difficult to learn how to play the shamisen.

23:25.019 --> 23:28.540
Especially if you're a ruffian that's outside of Japan maybe.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.141
A lot of ruffians know about it.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.862
They wrote a paper on it.

23:33.262 --> 23:35.323
Wow, this is really impressive too.

23:37.563 --> 23:42.886
I like the really like, there's like a happy, a happy like traditional feeling from it.

23:43.166 --> 23:46.448
It's funny because it feels also healing but different from the bone blanket.

23:46.488 --> 23:50.630
Yeah, I want to put on a kimono now after listening to it.

23:51.150 --> 23:53.691
Thank you Genji-mama!

23:54.412 --> 23:57.754
And our last single for today.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.395
This one is from Kendo!

24:00.435 --> 24:00.955
Kendo!

24:01.335 --> 24:03.757
Let's take a quick, a quick listen.

24:15.467 --> 24:15.767
Hi!

24:15.827 --> 24:17.148
You're so cute!

24:17.628 --> 24:18.749
You're happiness!

24:18.769 --> 24:19.409
BAU BAU!

24:20.169 --> 24:22.030
It reminds me kinda like a...

24:23.954 --> 24:30.336
When you just start a really colorful co-op game, you know maybe it has like pixel graphics?

24:30.376 --> 24:33.098
Sort of similar but different from Cookie and Cream.

24:33.318 --> 24:34.378
So cute!

24:35.799 --> 24:45.062
And I really like the use of our voices and the little ting at the end too.

24:45.082 --> 24:46.042
And the bonflowers!

24:48.197 --> 24:48.657
Thank you!

24:48.717 --> 24:52.319
Thank you for the BAU BAU!

24:52.859 --> 24:53.880
BAU BAU!

24:53.900 --> 24:54.840
Thank you!

24:55.421 --> 24:56.962
BAU BAU!

24:57.002 --> 24:57.542
BAU BAU!

24:58.082 --> 25:01.724
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your jingles.

25:01.784 --> 25:05.286
And thank you for letting us share them today with you!

25:05.426 --> 25:09.628
We hope you enjoyed these few ones that we were able to showcase today.

25:09.828 --> 25:14.250
And we hope that you look forward to the big reveal that's waiting for us on Friday.

25:14.350 --> 25:16.972
It's only two sleeps away, right, Moco-chan?

25:18.561 --> 25:18.781
Yes.

25:19.221 --> 25:19.521
Yes.

25:21.342 --> 25:24.103
Thank you, Ruffians!

25:24.123 --> 25:25.043
They're so good.

25:27.344 --> 25:29.705
Ruffians are just very, very impressive.

25:29.765 --> 25:31.365
What can I say?

25:31.385 --> 25:33.166
Are you surprised, Moco-chan?

25:33.546 --> 25:36.167
No, I'm not surprised, but I'm just very impressed.

25:38.448 --> 25:47.071
But, Ruffians, on the topic of being impressed, I wanted to say something!

25:48.106 --> 25:49.466
Is it okay if I say something?

25:51.287 --> 25:53.587
It doesn't matter because I'm gonna say it anyways!

25:54.247 --> 25:58.168
You know, today, it's the middle of the week!

25:59.048 --> 26:02.789
And you know, recently, it's been sort of rough.

26:03.429 --> 26:10.151
So, it's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

26:10.951 --> 26:14.732
And that means you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo.

26:17.225 --> 26:17.625
Yo!

26:18.626 --> 26:19.386
Ruffian!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.407
It's Wednesday!

26:21.888 --> 26:23.609
And maybe even Thursday!

26:24.229 --> 26:26.370
Congratulations!

26:27.231 --> 26:29.432
You thought the other day would take you down, didn't you?

26:29.452 --> 26:29.912
Huh?

26:31.113 --> 26:32.093
But guess what?

26:32.514 --> 26:33.054
It didn't!

26:33.914 --> 26:36.696
And that's because you're super duper strong!

26:37.316 --> 26:38.417
You're amazing!

26:38.657 --> 26:39.858
You're doing it!

26:40.598 --> 26:42.579
Rain or shine, you continue to go.

26:43.219 --> 26:45.141
And that is something that you need to recognize.

26:45.241 --> 26:45.641
Got it?

26:47.028 --> 26:47.548
Got it!

26:48.329 --> 26:49.169
You can do it!

26:49.710 --> 26:51.331
We can all do it together!

26:52.312 --> 26:59.477
And after this FUWAMOCO Morning, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna show the world just how awesome you are!

27:00.357 --> 27:05.541
Let's take all the silly things in stride and continue to be in control of our own world, okay?

27:06.581 --> 27:07.122
Got it?

27:08.283 --> 27:11.425
Cuz remember, I believe in you!

27:11.905 --> 27:12.966
You can do it!

27:13.526 --> 27:14.507
Ganbatte ne!

27:22.585 --> 27:25.227
That was a good Pup Talk, Moco-chan.

27:29.050 --> 27:31.372
You got this, Ruffians!

27:31.412 --> 27:35.535
You can do it!

27:35.855 --> 27:38.778
Moco-chan, shall we go to our regular corners?

27:38.958 --> 27:40.599
Doggie of the Day deshita.

27:40.679 --> 27:43.522
Okay, but who's our Doggie of the Day today?

27:45.712 --> 27:48.335
It's Juju!

27:48.715 --> 27:52.940
Look at this BAU-tiful smile!

27:52.960 --> 27:57.284
Actually, I feel like this is very impressive.

27:57.745 --> 27:59.627
Can you see those, Moco-chan?

27:59.907 --> 28:02.209
All those healthy white teeth there.

28:04.431 --> 28:05.312
Just like Moco-chan.

28:05.472 --> 28:07.713
Just like Moco-chan.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.275
Dogs' teeth are really important to their health, right?

28:11.315 --> 28:12.936
Just like Ruffians.

28:15.078 --> 28:16.879
You brush your teeth, right, Ruffians?

28:17.319 --> 28:18.660
It's already FUWAMOCO Morning.

28:18.680 --> 28:19.980
You brush your teeth, right?

28:20.441 --> 28:20.661
Go!

28:20.861 --> 28:22.042
Grab your tooth brush!

28:22.182 --> 28:23.623
You brush your teeth, right!

28:23.823 --> 28:26.845
You know what you can do while FUWAMOCO Morning is on, too?

28:27.950 --> 28:28.130
Juju.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.032
Juju's a German Shepherd.

28:30.072 --> 28:30.593
Kind of like, uh...

28:48.510 --> 28:50.771
You know, German Shepherds kinda similar.

28:50.871 --> 28:52.532
I don't think we have as much whiskers.

28:53.152 --> 28:53.592
Ah, no.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.253
Juju has wonderful whiskers.

28:55.733 --> 29:00.134
But, I think German Shepherds, they like guarding and protecting things, right?

29:01.335 --> 29:05.096
I'm sure Juju's really good at protecting smiles, you know?

29:05.116 --> 29:06.897
So cute.

29:07.737 --> 29:10.438
We're glad that Juju's still lovely.

29:10.478 --> 29:12.079
A happy friend.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.259
Do we have whiskers?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.060
Just use your eyes.

29:15.260 --> 29:16.141
Use your brain.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.726
How does Juju bau bau?

29:21.366 --> 29:27.829
I feel like through the teeth, you know, like... Yeah, you know, I think Juju...

29:37.170 --> 29:40.572
Has a very good sense of humor.

29:40.672 --> 29:47.795
You can see through the sparkly smile, sparkly eyes, a bit shadowy there, but I'm sure they're sparkly.

29:47.915 --> 29:49.916
Strong gommas, yeah.

29:50.076 --> 29:52.177
And you do have some very cute ears.

29:52.217 --> 29:55.018
You can't quite see here, but gravity.

29:55.618 --> 29:56.118
Ravity.

29:56.238 --> 29:59.460
No, no, gravity!

29:59.500 --> 30:00.720
No gravity!

30:00.780 --> 30:01.461
Gravity!

30:01.741 --> 30:02.921
They're very cute.

30:03.522 --> 30:04.442
Oh, Juju!

30:04.902 --> 30:08.284
Keep doing your best to protect your ruffian smile, okay?

30:09.324 --> 30:12.265
That's all the memory to smile just as big as Juju!

30:18.428 --> 30:29.692
And next, for today, I went on a walk with a Ruffian.

30:30.073 --> 30:31.693
Oh, this Ruffian is active!

30:31.713 --> 30:32.454
Very active.

30:32.474 --> 30:33.854
They went for a hike.

30:33.894 --> 30:34.494
Dangerous.

30:34.735 --> 30:38.316
And what's even better, I think Moco-chan

30:39.397 --> 30:44.058
They made a friend along the way, too!

30:44.118 --> 30:45.519
Is it a squirrel?

30:46.399 --> 30:46.999
A chipmunk?

30:47.679 --> 30:48.600
A tiny friend?

30:49.500 --> 30:50.020
A rodent?

30:50.540 --> 30:53.681
Whatever it is, I want to point.

30:53.961 --> 30:57.402
You know, it kind of looks like one of the rodents in the cartoons.

30:57.422 --> 30:57.982
Risu-senpai?

30:58.082 --> 31:00.763
I don't think Risu-senpai is quite that small.

31:00.783 --> 31:02.403
She's much cuter, she's much cuter.

31:05.242 --> 31:09.125
But you know, I think they probably got really close to you, right?

31:09.805 --> 31:11.606
Either that or you're really good at photography.

31:11.646 --> 31:12.447
Really good friends.

31:12.467 --> 31:15.889
National Geographic.

31:16.229 --> 31:24.095
But yes, you know Ruffians, it's very important not to feed the wildlife, you know, no matter how much we might want to.

31:24.535 --> 31:25.296
And look for it.

31:25.576 --> 31:26.136
Look for it!

31:28.818 --> 31:29.599
Look for it to.

31:30.970 --> 31:32.351
We can't have snacks.

31:32.812 --> 31:34.253
It's for their sake.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.474
We eat our snacks.

31:37.657 --> 31:39.658
They eat their snacks.

31:57.220 --> 32:03.663
It could be fun, you have to dodge them.

32:03.683 --> 32:06.265
I mean, get ready to dodge.

32:06.285 --> 32:09.987
I prefer that in my video games, not in real life.

32:10.547 --> 32:12.708
It's the fun part of hiking, okay?

32:13.108 --> 32:14.629
You never know what's gonna happen.

32:14.989 --> 32:17.551
Make some friends, dodge some rocks.

32:17.651 --> 32:18.231
Exactly!

32:18.671 --> 32:21.112
Ruffians make sure you go on lots of walks, okay?

32:22.486 --> 32:23.188
Falling rocks.

32:23.268 --> 32:23.849
Rocks and rocks.

32:24.290 --> 32:24.451
BAU BAU!

32:30.040 --> 32:33.722
Next we have our Question of the Day.

32:36.703 --> 32:39.244
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

32:39.544 --> 32:42.805
It's already September, and it's the season for School Trip!

32:42.845 --> 32:49.428
Whenever it comes to this time, I always recall the days of school trips back in my high school.

32:49.828 --> 32:52.109
Do you have similar experiences when you were students?

32:52.489 --> 32:53.670
I'd like to hear from you.

32:53.690 --> 32:56.011
Thank you for your question!

32:56.711 --> 33:02.496
Ah, well, FUWAMOCO, we have never really been on a shugaku-ryoku like they do in Japan, you know?

33:02.656 --> 33:04.057
It sounds fun.

33:04.578 --> 33:04.918
Right?

33:04.958 --> 33:11.704
Sometimes there'd be like little trips to like a museum where we'd learn about the great Demon Guard Dogs of the past.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.466
But... I don't know.

33:14.986 --> 33:17.448
It's nice being out, but it's not really that fun.

33:17.509 --> 33:18.409
It wasn't that fun.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.751
You know, they make you do homework after that.

33:20.771 --> 33:21.512
It's blaaaah.

33:23.214 --> 33:25.596
It'd be fun if I just learned and didn't have to do work.

33:25.976 --> 33:26.717
Right?

33:27.057 --> 33:30.039
But, you know, it looks really fun in anime.

33:30.059 --> 33:32.922
You know, they go to Hokkaido for sugaku ryoko.

33:33.002 --> 33:33.682
Yeah!

33:33.722 --> 33:37.765
They have a bunch of yummy food, and fun, and great sights.

33:37.825 --> 33:43.810
And at the end of the busy day, everyone all sleeps in the same room together.

33:43.830 --> 33:45.752
Like a sleepover party, right?

33:46.713 --> 33:49.455
Is that really a trip or is it just a vacation?

33:49.475 --> 33:50.937
I feel like it's kind of a vacation.

33:50.997 --> 33:51.757
A vacation?

33:52.018 --> 33:54.440
I don't know, I kind of feel... A vacation with friends.

33:54.460 --> 34:01.005
I feel a little bit envious, you know, when we see Shugaku Ryokan anime.

34:01.165 --> 34:03.327
You know, it's like, it's a multiple

34:03.467 --> 34:05.448
Day trip without parents, right?

34:05.568 --> 34:06.828
Yeah, it'd be fun.

34:06.908 --> 34:17.292
I mean, museums are fun, but I like it when we have to... We can just enjoy and learn like that instead of have to be focused on the homework and getting information for that.

34:17.492 --> 34:18.472
No, no pressure.

34:18.512 --> 34:19.513
Just learning is good.

34:19.633 --> 34:23.934
But considering, you know, shugaku ryoko usually doesn't... The teachers come along, right?

34:23.954 --> 34:24.935
But there's no parents.

34:25.355 --> 34:30.116
I feel like that would've been something we would've never been allowed to do, right?

34:31.257 --> 34:31.357
Aww.

34:34.647 --> 34:43.215
But, you know, even though our youth spent in the classroom may be over now, I think your youth only ends when you decide it has.

34:43.295 --> 34:49.240
So, you know, Ruffians, let's all continue our burning youth all together!

34:58.149 --> 35:04.296
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today.

35:04.336 --> 35:08.241
Remember though, we're still looking constantly, every day.

35:08.581 --> 35:14.664
For more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day, for your walks, and of course more questions too!

35:15.485 --> 35:22.409
We wanted to say, you know, we are always keeping an eye on the hashtag, but if you want to retweet your submissions, tweet them again.

35:22.929 --> 35:29.173
Because you think maybe they might have been missed or it's been a little while and you still haven't been on FUWAMOCO Morning.

35:29.273 --> 35:31.014
Please, please do, okay?

35:31.954 --> 35:38.818
Also, you know, I think maybe some Ruffians, they only have one doggy of a day.

35:38.838 --> 35:42.300
I would hope that their doggy is a doggy of every day.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.202
Yeah, but you know you're not gonna be switching out your dogs.

35:45.222 --> 35:48.324
So, I was gonna say...

35:49.620 --> 35:53.785
And for our next stream, what do we have up next?

35:53.825 --> 35:54.365
We have...

36:11.099 --> 36:12.079
Our album!

36:12.559 --> 36:13.040
Album!

36:13.400 --> 36:13.720
Album!

36:13.740 --> 36:18.021
We're gonna be making our debut in the hololive Minecraft server.

36:18.061 --> 36:21.722
And for us, it's Minecraft debut.

36:21.982 --> 36:23.042
Yeah.

36:23.362 --> 36:24.622
We're really, really nervous.

36:24.662 --> 36:24.842
Yes.

36:26.343 --> 36:26.803
Yeah.

36:27.123 --> 36:29.083
We've never played Minecraft.

36:29.123 --> 36:31.964
We've watched Minecraft, but I don't know what's going on.

36:32.024 --> 36:32.504
Yeah.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.445
We're just like, oh, this is cool, but I'm lost.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.205
They're not lost.

36:37.645 --> 36:38.766
I don't know what they're doing.

36:38.786 --> 36:40.286
There's a lot of sounds, but yeah.

36:40.746 --> 36:43.567
And you know we were having a bunch of issues today.

36:43.587 --> 36:53.192
So we tried to test it before FUWAMOCO Morning did it, but... We ran into Mikocchi-senpai, and Okayu-senpai, and Aki-senpai!

36:54.293 --> 36:55.353
And you know what?

36:56.013 --> 36:59.135
I didn't even know how to type or move around or anything.

36:59.235 --> 37:01.296
So we just sort of panicked a bit.

37:01.736 --> 37:04.618
Googling how to type in Minecraft!

37:04.678 --> 37:06.158
How to jump in Minecraft!

37:06.238 --> 37:06.879
We didn't get that far.

37:06.919 --> 37:09.140
How do we bow in Minecraft?

37:10.100 --> 37:11.942
But it was fun though!

37:12.082 --> 37:13.263
But very overwhelming.

37:14.944 --> 37:19.027
Thank you Mikochi-senpai for all the takoyaki!

37:19.067 --> 37:20.848
Moco-chan shared one with me.

37:20.868 --> 37:22.729
I promised to share.

37:22.950 --> 37:23.430
Just one.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.871
More.

37:24.911 --> 37:30.495
But you know, because of it, I think we're looking forward to Minecraft even more now, right?

37:30.555 --> 37:33.697
It was fun, wasn't it?

37:34.037 --> 37:37.099
But the debut is just about to start today.

37:37.320 --> 37:37.860
Tonight.

37:39.361 --> 37:42.404
Please look forward to as much as we are, Ruffians!

37:42.905 --> 37:44.306
BAU BAU!

37:45.507 --> 37:45.667
And!

37:45.928 --> 37:47.149
Our schedule!

37:47.169 --> 37:48.690
Look at the schedule.

37:49.231 --> 37:52.634
Wow, we still have a lot of exciting things happening this week.

37:53.115 --> 37:53.395
But!

37:54.276 --> 37:59.982
On Friday, we have a Japanese lesson with all of Abyss going right on up.

38:00.422 --> 38:01.063
Teacher!

38:01.123 --> 38:02.844
FUWAMOCO Teacher!

38:03.345 --> 38:11.733
We're going to be teaching from the very basics up until having a regular conversation with all of you in Japanese.

38:12.033 --> 38:14.035
We're really looking forward to it.

38:14.055 --> 38:18.119
We've never spoken in Japanese and had a conversation with all of you before.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.841
Ruffians!

38:21.001 --> 38:25.566
We wanted to ask though, is there anything in particular that you want us to teach them?

38:25.586 --> 38:27.948
Do you have any ideas, Ruffians?

38:37.901 --> 38:38.702
Bad words.

38:39.563 --> 38:43.968
We have to use good words with our senpai, okay?

38:44.608 --> 38:47.792
But Ruffians, you don't have to try to think right now.

38:48.152 --> 38:52.236
Let us know with the hashtag, this time, hashtag helpFUWAMOCO.

38:55.019 --> 38:57.181
F-W-M-O-C-O.

38:57.281 --> 39:02.785
And that way, you know, we might be able to include it in our lesson plan, right?

39:03.005 --> 39:06.127
Because we're teachers, we need to have a lesson plan.

39:06.408 --> 39:07.228
Preparation.

39:07.268 --> 39:08.209
Yeah, it's good.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.031
You can't think right on the spot, right?

39:11.051 --> 39:12.392
That's okay.

39:12.432 --> 39:17.636
But the sooner you can think of it and tweet about it, that would be appreciated.

39:18.476 --> 39:20.518
Lesson plan has to get written pretty quickly.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.341
BAU BAU!

39:24.642 --> 39:31.489
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for another episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

39:32.050 --> 39:39.197
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

40:17.999 --> 40:21.201
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

40:21.221 --> 40:22.441
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

40:22.521 --> 40:23.101
