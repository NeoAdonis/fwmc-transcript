05:09.735 --> 05:12.147
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:12.628 --> 05:16.233
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.253 --> 05:18.536
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.576 --> 05:20.339
BAU BAU!

05:20.379 --> 05:24.645
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:28.160 --> 05:31.143
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:31.243 --> 05:34.005
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:34.065 --> 05:35.766
BAU BAU BAU!

05:36.147 --> 05:39.810
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.830 --> 05:39.890
Yes.

05:40.370 --> 05:44.934
Thank you, Ruffians, for being here with us for our 38th episode!

05:45.194 --> 05:47.416
How did that happen?

05:48.717 --> 05:47.416
38?

05:49.118 --> 05:49.678
That's almost 40.

05:49.798 --> 05:52.100
Honestly, it's almost 50.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.181
We're almost there.

05:53.221 --> 05:54.382
Before you know it, it'll be 50.

05:55.543 --> 05:58.784
BAU BAU!

05:59.604 --> 06:05.606
Well, for some Ruffians, you know, even though it's the 38th episode, it might be their first episode today.

06:05.686 --> 06:06.346
Very happy.

06:06.406 --> 06:12.868
To explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:13.108 --> 06:14.529
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:14.949 --> 06:17.810
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:18.650 --> 06:23.672
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:24.512 --> 06:31.995
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:32.456 --> 06:36.257
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:36.677 --> 06:39.038
BAU BAU!

06:39.838 --> 06:43.100
Well, it's the first FUWAMOCO Morning of this month.

06:45.086 --> 06:47.387
Has there been a Pero Sighting?

06:47.727 --> 06:49.427
Has a Ruffian seen one?

06:49.447 --> 06:50.288
There has been.

06:50.588 --> 06:55.089
It's been sort of a spooky Pero Sighting, but... How will this one be?

06:56.350 --> 06:56.690
De-den.

06:57.610 --> 07:05.473
A Ruffian spotted Pero working on doing some weight training at the gym.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.333
Good for you for getting to the gym!

07:07.353 --> 07:08.714
It takes a lot of effort, right?

07:10.990 --> 07:16.553
I don't know, I don't think that, uh, Halo's source of motivation is the nicest.

07:17.454 --> 07:23.097
But, I mean, being motivated is good, but positive sources are the best, you know?

07:23.117 --> 07:25.618
Positive, yeah, that's true.

07:25.638 --> 07:28.400
But, uh, you know, it's a new month.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.581
And you know, it's not just any new month.

07:31.082 --> 07:34.223
It's November, the second to last month of the year.

07:34.243 --> 07:34.904
Second to last.

07:36.525 --> 07:37.345
You know, that means that 2023,

07:39.957 --> 07:40.698
It's almost over.

07:42.039 --> 07:45.363
And maybe you had some goals you wanted to accomplish at the start of the year.

07:45.383 --> 07:48.367
Like going to the gym.

07:49.548 --> 07:50.169
But you know what?

07:51.109 --> 07:54.652
You can still do that right now!

07:54.932 --> 07:55.212
Yeah!

07:55.272 --> 08:02.158
You know, if you go and work out hard at the gym, maybe you can grow strong and help protect those foam pedals.

08:02.298 --> 08:02.518
Yeah.

08:02.959 --> 08:07.823
You know, I think FUWAMOCO, we're pretty good at protecting your smile, maybe?

08:07.843 --> 08:08.283
Maybe.

08:08.503 --> 08:12.106
Yeah, we're rather agile, but not so much muscle.

08:12.206 --> 08:13.247
Oh, are you sure?

08:13.267 --> 08:16.290
Moco-chan, you think you're cool for this?

08:16.490 --> 08:18.732
I'm pretty muscular, you just can't see it.

08:20.532 --> 08:23.195
Maybe we should go to the gym too, Moco-chan.

08:24.255 --> 08:24.476
Yeah.

08:24.956 --> 08:25.597
Gym month!

08:26.137 --> 08:26.758
November.

08:26.838 --> 08:27.178
Yeah.

08:27.338 --> 08:28.840
Let's do it.

08:29.340 --> 08:30.761
BAU BAU!

08:30.982 --> 08:33.284
Good luck and don't overdo it.

08:33.324 --> 08:34.084
Don't overdo it.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.447
I'm not talking to Pero, I'm talking to you.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.348
Pero, he can throw his back out.

08:38.428 --> 08:38.909
It's okay.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.010
Yeah.

08:40.050 --> 08:40.490
It's all good.

08:41.211 --> 08:42.973
BAU BAU!

08:43.813 --> 08:44.874
Well...

08:46.385 --> 08:49.726
It's been a very exciting time recently.

08:50.226 --> 08:56.969
And Ruffians, you know, it's been very spooky and a busy past Halloween week.

08:57.829 --> 09:07.492
And within all the hustle and bustle and toil and jumble, you know, FUWAMOCO, we released our second cover song, CUTE!

09:07.552 --> 09:08.352
YAKANOJO!

09:08.372 --> 09:10.153
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

09:11.250 --> 09:15.754
If you haven't listened to it, please go and do so.

09:16.615 --> 09:19.597
And if you already have, do it again!

09:21.479 --> 09:23.100
Yeah, your ears can take it, right?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.982
Right!

09:25.242 --> 09:33.088
It's a bit of a spooky song, you know, where more of like a FUWAMOCO's possessive yamere saikara comes out.

09:33.969 --> 09:36.751
You say it like we have a younger side or something.

09:37.632 --> 09:37.952
No.

09:38.572 --> 09:39.233
We don't, right?

09:39.473 --> 09:40.033
Ruffians.

09:40.214 --> 09:40.314
No.

09:40.334 --> 09:40.934
No such thing.

09:40.994 --> 09:41.234
No.

09:43.256 --> 09:46.298
This is, you know... This is a different FUWAMOCO, right?

09:46.338 --> 09:46.718
Different.

09:46.798 --> 09:48.139
It's Halloween.

09:48.399 --> 09:49.700
It's Halloween, okay?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.722
Halloween means you dress up.

09:55.284 --> 09:57.746
Why are you making those faces, Ruffians?

09:59.295 --> 10:01.382
It's just, just, that's it, right?

10:03.288 --> 10:05.315
Don't misunderstand our characters.

10:06.030 --> 10:10.513
We'd be really happy if you could listen to our songs and share it with your friends too!

10:11.033 --> 10:11.153
And!

10:11.574 --> 10:11.694
And!

10:12.174 --> 10:12.394
And!

10:12.875 --> 10:14.075
Because of you!

10:15.036 --> 10:19.099
It's already at 100,000 views!

10:19.119 --> 10:19.839
BAU BAU!

10:19.879 --> 10:20.400
Thank you!

10:20.680 --> 10:21.841
Thank you!

10:21.921 --> 10:31.267
But, you know, us and all the other creators and staff worked really hard to make it happen, so it'd mean a lot to us if you could love it lots too.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.409
We want to continue to do lots of music and cool things, so...

10:36.290 --> 10:36.550
BAU BAU!

10:36.590 --> 10:37.511
BAU BAU!

10:37.551 --> 10:38.292
More happy things!

10:57.386 --> 11:02.147
Ruffians, you know that we wake up early to be able to produce FUWAMOCO Morning.

11:02.187 --> 11:02.768
Get ready.

11:02.888 --> 11:12.311
But today, we woke up even a bit earlier to be able to see a very special senpai's return!

11:12.691 --> 11:13.231
Yeah!

11:13.291 --> 11:13.831
Jumon-senpai!

11:13.851 --> 11:15.952
Yes, my Jumon-senpai!

11:15.992 --> 11:17.692
BAU BAU!

11:17.792 --> 11:18.152
BAU BAU!

11:18.192 --> 11:23.454
She made her return today after being away for over half of a year.

11:23.694 --> 11:25.775
We're so happy!

11:26.915 --> 11:36.759
Actually, when the starting screen began and Red Heart started playing, Moco-chan started crying really hard.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.080
I was like, huh?

11:39.100 --> 11:39.800
Moco-chan?

11:39.820 --> 11:42.801
I was trying to be quiet.

11:42.881 --> 11:44.782
Wait, it's just be quiet!

11:45.142 --> 11:49.984
I was thinking about how happy and relieved the Heart-tubers be to have Heart-tubers senpai back!

11:58.697 --> 12:16.632
As some Ruffians might know from our holotalk with Kiara-senpai, you know, Hajime-senpai was how we originally first learned about hololive.

12:17.372 --> 12:17.612
Yeah.

12:19.033 --> 12:28.000
You know, I saw a picture of Haachama-senpai on Twitter and I thought she was a really cute heroine from like a newly released Bishoujo game, like a visual novel.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.463
And I wanted to play her because she looked really cute.

12:32.383 --> 12:36.605
But then, I found out that she was a VTuber from a place called hololive!

12:38.226 --> 12:48.231
Actually, to be completely honest, I was a little disappointed because I thought, you know, my brief dream would've been able to come true.

12:48.251 --> 12:48.811
Like, it was just over.

12:48.931 --> 12:50.752
Over, right there and then.

12:50.812 --> 12:51.693
But, maybe!

12:52.648 --> 12:53.228
Maybe!

12:53.829 --> 12:57.491
Now it can come true!

12:58.271 --> 12:58.552
I guess.

12:58.792 --> 13:02.874
We're really happy that Haachama-senpai is back.

13:02.934 --> 13:09.998
And we're glad to be able to see her newly premiered video for her original song that, you know, she wrote all herself.

13:10.158 --> 13:14.901
It's nice to see the video after seeing her performance at 4th Fest too.

13:14.981 --> 13:16.982
BAU BAU!

13:17.223 --> 13:19.804
Welcome back Haachama-senpai!

13:21.505 --> 13:22.526
Can I have a tissue?

13:23.026 --> 13:23.207
No.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.008
It's your fault for crying.

13:25.428 --> 13:26.429
I'm dead.

13:26.990 --> 13:27.810
I'm sorry!

13:28.891 --> 13:30.493
Tears are all over my cheeks.

13:32.434 --> 13:33.215
It's happy, right?

13:33.235 --> 13:35.857
Welcome back, Haachama-san!

13:35.917 --> 13:38.019
Welcome back!

13:38.199 --> 13:39.480
And there's more happy news!

13:39.580 --> 13:40.961
More happy news!

13:43.303 --> 13:44.264
Ruffia!

13:44.825 --> 13:44.965
Yeah.

13:45.805 --> 13:46.606
Lots of happy.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.586
Extra happy.

13:47.926 --> 13:53.550
It's extra happy day today because it's DOG DAY!

13:53.730 --> 13:55.812
Inu no hi!

13:55.932 --> 13:57.393
BAU BAU!

13:57.473 --> 13:58.053
BAU BAI!

13:58.314 --> 14:01.376
Doesn't that just make your tail start wagging, Moco-chan?

14:01.456 --> 14:01.776
It does.

14:02.016 --> 14:03.897
It makes me proud to be a Demon Guard dog.

14:03.937 --> 14:05.939
You know, it's our day today.

14:06.039 --> 14:07.400
It's our day!

14:07.700 --> 14:13.464
Ruffians, we hope that today inspires you to share your love about your favorite dogs in your life.

14:13.964 --> 14:14.545
That's right.

14:15.765 --> 14:24.649
And maybe if you go on a walk and you pass by a dog, you'll ask the owner if it's okay if you give it a few extra hugs.

14:25.009 --> 14:26.629
That makes us really happy.

14:27.850 --> 14:32.352
We're really happy to be the demon guard dog sisters of hololive.

14:32.492 --> 14:33.092
Yeah!

14:33.152 --> 14:34.613
We're really proud!

14:34.693 --> 14:40.135
We hope that you'll also share this special day with some of our other doggie senpai too.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.015
Like, Bailey us!

14:45.148 --> 14:53.711
Because it's dog day today, Ruffians, let's all BAU BAU together for dog day.

14:54.211 --> 14:54.751
Okay?

14:54.771 --> 14:56.152
Are you ready?

14:56.372 --> 14:58.452
BAU BAU!

14:58.532 --> 15:00.973
BAU BAU!

15:01.053 --> 15:02.794
BAU BAU!

15:11.584 --> 15:14.425
Happy doggy!

15:17.065 --> 15:18.286
Are you awake now?

15:18.486 --> 15:22.487
That felt good.

15:23.307 --> 15:26.908
We also have a bit of something we want to say.

15:27.148 --> 15:28.389
Are we guilty about this?

15:28.609 --> 15:31.309
No, but I wanted to check in on the Ruffians.

15:31.549 --> 15:33.150
How are you feeling today?

15:33.650 --> 15:36.651
You know, after a very busy Halloween and everything.

15:37.605 --> 15:38.666
Did you wake up alright?

15:39.046 --> 15:39.787
Are you good?

15:39.927 --> 15:40.868
Are you awake now?

15:41.168 --> 15:43.550
You don't feel a little lethargic or anything?

15:43.570 --> 15:44.411
Sleepy.

15:44.451 --> 15:46.513
The posture is a little tired.

15:46.533 --> 15:50.256
Did you maybe eat too much candy?

15:50.276 --> 15:52.978
Too many sweets?

15:54.279 --> 15:56.061
Maybe even a few ponderings?

15:56.301 --> 15:57.382
Too much candy.

15:57.842 --> 16:03.667
We hope you feel better soon if that's the case, but FUWAMOCO!

16:03.687 --> 16:05.089
We have a bit of a confession.

16:06.937 --> 16:08.480
Wow, FUWAMOCO!

16:10.665 --> 16:13.530
You know, I confession.

16:15.686 --> 16:18.909
We didn't have any candy!

16:19.069 --> 16:19.689
No sweets.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.212
We avoided all the howling tummy pains.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.694
Ruffian great.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.315
BAU BAU!

16:26.935 --> 16:29.077
But it's really tempting though.

16:29.137 --> 16:29.398
It is.

16:29.618 --> 16:33.801
You know, especially now that the candy might be on sale.

16:33.941 --> 16:34.322
Right?

16:34.722 --> 16:37.965
It's nice because you can get a lot of variety, right?

16:38.405 --> 16:40.726
That really only comes up this time of the year.

16:40.766 --> 16:50.349
But you know, it's important to be careful with the sales because the leftover sale candies, they're probably the types that will make you hurt the most after eating too many.

16:50.369 --> 16:51.410
Yeah.

16:51.830 --> 16:55.791
So it's best to be nice to yourself and to your tummy too.

16:55.811 --> 16:56.151
Yeah.

16:56.372 --> 16:57.272
Right, right, Moco-chan?

16:57.292 --> 16:58.712
Yeah, yeah, tummy.

16:58.732 --> 17:02.614
Yeah, and if you end up eating only candy, no,

17:04.454 --> 17:06.378
Ruffians, it's not good for you.

17:06.438 --> 17:08.002
You know what the cure is, right?

17:10.347 --> 17:10.728
Water.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.634
But that helps, but... Vegetables.

17:14.095 --> 17:14.877
That helps too.

17:18.246 --> 17:25.890
The cure for a candy tummy is NATTO!

17:26.370 --> 17:27.671
So watch out, Ruffians.

17:28.351 --> 17:28.771
No.

17:29.531 --> 17:30.692
Watch out, Moco-chan.

17:30.752 --> 17:32.553
I'll have water, thank you.

17:33.613 --> 17:34.074
BAU BAU!

17:34.794 --> 17:38.556
BAU BAU!

17:38.816 --> 17:42.698
Well, today is truly a day filled with only happy things.

17:42.778 --> 17:44.339
Because Ruffians!

17:47.588 --> 17:50.089
You know what?

17:50.109 --> 17:55.171
Well, with it being the first day of the month and everything... You know what?

17:56.772 --> 17:57.532
We did it!

17:58.193 --> 18:05.956
We started this month on the right paw because... There's no miss on this channel!

18:05.996 --> 18:08.357
No miss on this channel!

18:08.397 --> 18:10.378
BAU BAU BAU!

18:10.398 --> 18:10.878
Ruffians.

18:11.522 --> 18:14.684
You think we can make this the month of no misunderstandings?

18:14.744 --> 18:16.926
No, no misunderstandings of November.

18:16.966 --> 18:19.587
Wouldn't that be great?

18:19.627 --> 18:21.709
It would be great, right, Ruffians?

18:22.669 --> 18:23.190
Right!

18:24.912 --> 18:25.132
Eh!

18:25.713 --> 18:26.013
Eh!

18:26.113 --> 18:26.353
No!

18:26.514 --> 18:26.714
No!

18:26.934 --> 18:28.295
Eh ya de.

18:28.496 --> 18:29.116
Eh ya de.

18:29.617 --> 18:31.118
Eh ya de.

18:31.579 --> 18:37.344
I'd be really happy if we could turn a new leaf just as the leaves are falling from the trees too.

18:37.405 --> 18:40.327
You know we can still make this the end of the year right.

18:40.528 --> 18:42.710
We won't miss understanding.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.571
It's our chance.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.560
BAU BAU!

18:49.141 --> 18:51.242
There's more exciting things happening!

18:51.262 --> 18:52.062
More good things!

18:52.283 --> 18:53.783
It's not just good things!

18:54.364 --> 18:58.346
Today is just good things!

18:58.987 --> 19:00.467
And a smile for you!

19:00.528 --> 19:02.249
And for Moco-chan!

19:02.589 --> 19:03.990
Happy things!

19:04.930 --> 19:06.791
The best way to start off the month.

19:08.432 --> 19:20.980
Well, Ruffians, you know, like I've mentioned over and over again, the end of October is a little busier than usual, so maybe some plans got a little bit changed here and there.

19:21.220 --> 19:30.065
But, like usual, we wanted to do our end of the month BAU response to you on Twitter!

19:31.366 --> 19:32.187
Hi!

19:32.427 --> 19:33.247
Hi!

19:33.748 --> 19:38.291
Yes, so today, we'll be doing another voting response.

19:38.631 --> 19:42.954
Yes, if you are not sure what a voting response is, it's simple.

19:43.134 --> 19:43.534
Don't worry.

19:43.634 --> 19:43.975
Simple.

19:44.535 --> 19:49.818
For a certain amount of time, we will be doing our all to respond to your tweets.

19:49.858 --> 19:51.319
Yeah, to your tweets.

19:51.359 --> 19:54.442
We can't respond to every Ruffian's tweets, but we'll do our best.

19:54.722 --> 19:58.044
We'll do our everything so we can respond to the most we can.

19:58.644 --> 20:01.066
And how it goes, we'll put out a tweet

20:01.266 --> 20:01.867
BAU BAU!

20:06.345 --> 20:07.826
FUWAMOCO underscore EN.

20:07.946 --> 20:09.466
You can see it right up there.

20:09.486 --> 20:10.426
I forgot it.

20:10.766 --> 20:11.767
Oh, it's right there, right.

20:11.887 --> 20:12.547
I forgot it.

20:12.647 --> 20:13.727
I was panicking a bit.

20:15.008 --> 20:16.008
What was it again?

20:17.509 --> 20:21.910
And if you respond to that tweet using the hashtag, hashtag FUWAMOCO.

20:22.070 --> 20:23.211
F-U-W-A-M-O-C-O.

20:23.251 --> 20:25.091
In case you don't know how to spell.

20:25.431 --> 20:27.152
Yeah, use that in your tweet.

20:27.412 --> 20:29.073
We'll do our best to respond.

20:29.973 --> 20:35.835
You know, which Ruffians we respond to is always completely random, but we do hope that you'll be able to

20:37.236 --> 20:40.238
Send us a tweet and now we can send you a tweet back!

20:40.278 --> 20:40.579
Yeah!

20:40.879 --> 20:46.824
You know, the Rawr response is something that we really look forward to at the end of every month.

20:46.884 --> 20:51.628
So we hope that you'll decide to pipe up from the pack and give us a tweet!

20:51.748 --> 20:52.308
Yeah!

20:52.629 --> 20:57.613
And the Rawr response, it starts at 8pm PT tonight.

20:57.653 --> 20:59.975
And it will go for an hour and a half as usual.

21:00.615 --> 21:02.715
Until 9.30pm PT.

21:03.076 --> 21:04.496
So we hope that you'll tweet at us!

21:04.836 --> 21:07.256
And we hope that we can tweet back at you too!

21:07.796 --> 21:09.597
BAU BAU!

21:09.637 --> 21:12.937
Don't forget Ruffians, you can set an alarm right now.

21:12.977 --> 21:16.598
We might not have a stream tonight, but we have the alarm response.

21:16.638 --> 21:18.319
We do, yeah.

21:18.979 --> 21:21.039
So you know, we're never too far apart.

21:21.059 --> 21:22.439
BAU BAU!

21:26.758 --> 21:28.680
I guess it's the start of a new month, right?

21:29.040 --> 21:29.460
It is.

21:29.540 --> 21:29.881
A new leaf.

21:29.961 --> 21:30.521
A new leaf?

21:30.902 --> 21:35.586
The leaves are kind of old because they're falling.

21:35.626 --> 21:36.567
We can... A pretty leaf.

21:36.947 --> 21:37.748
Maybe not the newest.

21:37.768 --> 21:39.409
Turn a new leaf and then fall.

21:41.191 --> 21:43.513
But just in case some Ruffians needed it!

21:44.814 --> 21:47.156
I... I wanted to say something.

21:47.476 --> 21:47.956
Okay.

21:53.381 --> 21:54.142
Ruffians!

21:56.041 --> 21:57.202
Ruffians!

21:58.903 --> 22:00.104
Good morning!

22:00.984 --> 22:02.345
It's November!

22:04.467 --> 22:08.689
And I'm not November, I'm Mococo!

22:08.709 --> 22:18.076
I think maybe you have an idea of what time of day and week it is hopefully, but in case you don't,

22:19.272 --> 22:19.732
Yes!

22:20.532 --> 22:24.113
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

22:24.693 --> 22:28.534
And that means this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

22:28.554 --> 22:32.415
Halloween is over!

22:32.435 --> 22:34.875
The spooky month is gone!

22:35.935 --> 22:43.037
But... Unfortunately... I have one more scary thing to say.

22:46.892 --> 22:51.014
The year is almost over!

22:51.054 --> 22:52.875
Goodbye to 2023!

22:53.155 --> 22:53.475
Soon.

22:55.176 --> 22:58.158
You know, has it been a good year for you?

22:58.178 --> 23:02.900
If it hasn't, you know what?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.941
You can still make it good!

23:07.062 --> 23:09.383
Even if things aren't going how you like them to.

23:10.104 --> 23:14.546
Try to think, well, what can I do to make the situation better for me?

23:15.799 --> 23:17.479
How can I learn from my experiences?

23:17.940 --> 23:18.600
From these bumps?

23:19.960 --> 23:24.982
You know, I know sometimes in the moment, it can be sort of hard.

23:25.822 --> 23:26.902
It can be frustrating.

23:27.822 --> 23:29.283
And it's okay to feel like that!

23:30.443 --> 23:35.745
But, let's try to think on how I deal with these same kind of bumps next time they show up, okay?

23:36.225 --> 23:38.946
Because, you know, they definitely will.

23:39.926 --> 23:40.106
But!

23:41.070 --> 23:43.631
Then, you'll be ready!

23:43.971 --> 23:45.212
You'll be ready for them!

23:45.492 --> 23:47.092
Because you're stronger.

23:47.112 --> 23:48.853
I know you can do it.

23:49.553 --> 23:53.055
Let's try to grow from every mistake and not let them take us down.

23:54.155 --> 23:57.636
But, also, it's very important.

23:58.417 --> 24:02.398
You have to make sure to give yourself some time to rest up, okay?

24:04.099 --> 24:05.279
I know you can do it!

24:05.999 --> 24:07.700
Let's do it all together, okay?

24:07.720 --> 24:09.101
Ganbatte ne!

24:11.091 --> 24:14.833
BAU BAU!

24:14.933 --> 24:15.634
BAU BAU!

24:16.174 --> 24:18.475
Oh, we're a bit close.

24:18.515 --> 24:19.556
Let's take a step back.

24:19.996 --> 24:27.020
Ruffians, do you feel ready to go for a run?

24:27.100 --> 24:28.660
BAU BAU!

24:28.681 --> 24:35.144
Well, Moco-chan, let's have a look at some of our special submissions from our Ruffians.

24:35.824 --> 24:36.745
Today is...

24:37.577 --> 24:38.598
Another Doggie of the Day.

24:38.638 --> 24:39.338
Doggie of the Day!

24:39.378 --> 24:40.118
On dog day!

24:40.298 --> 24:40.859
Right!

24:41.079 --> 24:41.819
On dog day.

24:41.839 --> 24:42.600
Let's see who we have!

24:42.660 --> 24:43.960
Doggie of the Day today is... De-den!

24:43.980 --> 24:45.721
I love the cute raw tummy hair.

24:45.981 --> 24:48.963
Yeah, this is the dog of the day on dog day!

24:48.983 --> 25:02.770
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I

25:04.330 --> 25:15.617
I'm not really the kind to expose my tummy like this.

25:15.677 --> 25:16.797
That's Moco-chan.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.278
I would never do that.

25:19.399 --> 25:20.099
Never, ever.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.281
Ruffians!

25:22.741 --> 25:24.082
I would never, ever do that.

25:24.722 --> 25:29.965
Moco-chan would never show her tummy to you and give you some big puppy dog eyes and be like...

25:31.497 --> 25:31.957
Tommy-kun.

25:55.430 --> 25:55.750
I guess.

25:57.231 --> 25:59.773
And how does Tomi-kun say BAU BAU?

25:59.873 --> 26:02.495
I feel like it's a very sunny day.

26:02.515 --> 26:04.916
Well, you have to first imagine you're on your back.

26:04.936 --> 26:09.699
Is that maybe BAU BAU from the back?

26:16.518 --> 26:21.320
Well, you know, this is our Doggie of the Day on Dog Day!

26:21.420 --> 26:21.680
Yes.

26:22.420 --> 26:22.680
Wow.

26:23.721 --> 26:25.261
Look at their guarding skills.

26:25.581 --> 26:26.442
Very efficient.

26:26.902 --> 26:30.363
They're working hard all because they love you.

26:31.303 --> 26:32.924
No matter how hard it might get.

26:33.744 --> 26:38.006
When they, you know, they think of your smile and what you mean to them.

26:38.626 --> 26:41.907
And that's what powers them to BAU BAU for another day.

26:42.247 --> 26:43.128
And continue guarding.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.188
Beautiful.

26:44.918 --> 26:48.823
BAU BAU!

26:48.983 --> 26:53.248
It's getting colder right now, but Ruffians, you're still going for walks, right?

26:53.809 --> 26:55.531
Let's take a look where you at this time.

26:55.551 --> 26:56.212
De-den!

26:56.232 --> 26:58.515
A golden carpet!

27:03.553 --> 27:05.613
Those trees sure had a lot of leaves, huh?

27:05.633 --> 27:06.033
Right.

27:06.774 --> 27:11.194
But this makes me want to go to New York City and join you on this walk!

27:11.695 --> 27:12.695
It's so pretty.

27:13.175 --> 27:16.876
We did go to 1920s New York the other day, right?

27:16.956 --> 27:17.516
Does that count?

27:17.536 --> 27:18.056
That's different.

27:18.096 --> 27:18.756
Does that count?

27:18.796 --> 27:19.256
Doesn't count.

27:19.316 --> 27:20.276
We did go to the park.

27:20.736 --> 27:21.036
True.

27:21.196 --> 27:21.937
Battery Park.

27:22.777 --> 27:28.598
But we hope that you'll be able to still go out and go on more pretty autumn walks like this for a few more weeks!

27:28.618 --> 27:29.538
Yeah!

27:30.198 --> 27:32.640
You need to walk down those golden carpets while you still can.

27:32.740 --> 27:33.441
Right?

27:33.521 --> 27:35.142
They've only been around for so long.

27:35.162 --> 27:35.303
BAU BAU!

27:40.598 --> 27:42.819
We got a question from a Ruffian.

27:42.839 --> 27:46.341
The Question of the Day is... De-den!

27:47.101 --> 27:52.684
Have you ever changed your outlook on life or attitude about something because of a story you experienced?

27:53.004 --> 27:58.987
Your determination is so strong, it makes me very curious what kind of story has shaped who you are today.

27:59.047 --> 28:01.708
Thank you for being so inspiring to us too!

28:01.728 --> 28:02.309
BAU BAU!

28:07.355 --> 28:09.495
This is a bit of a tricky question.

28:09.535 --> 28:21.700
Well, there have been a lot of visual novels and anime that have influenced our outlook on life and maybe, you know, what we feel is important to us.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.761
But I think it's kind of hard to pinpoint it, right?

28:26.962 --> 28:30.903
But there are also lots of creators and other creators and anime and games

28:31.343 --> 28:35.064
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

28:56.790 --> 29:03.878
And also, the type of things that Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy sort of instilled on us from a young age are really important.

29:04.458 --> 29:13.988
You know, the stuff like treat others as you'd like to be treated, and thinking of things from others' perspectives, being kind, understanding manners, all that stuff, etc.

29:14.008 --> 29:14.328
You know?

29:14.689 --> 29:15.570
Lots of things like that.

29:15.590 --> 29:16.190
For us.

29:17.992 --> 29:27.999
Those sort of things are just normal and the baseline of life, so it can be a bit difficult for us when something or someone sort of challenges those normals, you know?

29:28.159 --> 29:35.324
It can make us a bit sad that those might not be normal for someone else, but you know, we don't have control over that, you know?

29:35.804 --> 29:38.926
We're FUWAMOCO, we only have control over ourselves.

29:40.683 --> 29:44.207
Continue to be stubborn for what we believe is right.

29:44.307 --> 29:45.828
That's just the FUWAMOCO way, you know?

29:47.230 --> 29:48.872
Did that answer your question at all?

29:50.353 --> 29:50.834
Maybe.

29:51.595 --> 29:52.255
Maybe not.

29:53.477 --> 29:56.460
I don't know, maybe the answer is yes and no.

29:59.226 --> 30:02.308
BAU BAU!

30:02.368 --> 30:05.551
That was a good question, but a bit tricky, right?

30:06.191 --> 30:07.952
FUWAMOCO, we are smart.

30:08.253 --> 30:10.835
BAU BAU!

30:10.915 --> 30:17.299
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions, all your support, all your tweets.

30:17.559 --> 30:21.182
Please remember, you know, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together.

30:22.583 --> 30:25.785
We always are looking for more Doggie of the Days!

30:26.105 --> 30:29.687
For seeing the kind of walks that you're going on, even though it's getting colder!

30:29.707 --> 30:31.368
You know, getting questions!

30:31.428 --> 30:33.589
Make sure you're warm when you go outside, okay?

30:34.009 --> 30:34.129
Yeah.

30:34.189 --> 30:35.730
Good time for questions, too!

30:35.990 --> 30:37.891
Pero Sightings, if you happen to see Pero!

30:38.031 --> 30:39.372
Please, don't forget, please...

30:41.753 --> 30:42.454
Please don't forget.

30:42.494 --> 30:44.175
Yeah, I almost said please forget.

30:44.395 --> 30:45.696
Please forget!

30:46.397 --> 30:48.318
Don't forget to use the hashtag.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.541
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

30:51.721 --> 30:53.903
BAU BAU!

30:55.560 --> 30:57.441
And for our next dream.

30:57.721 --> 31:04.004
We're gonna be taking the afternoon off a bit here while we work on some more homework.

31:04.044 --> 31:06.405
But we still have the Rock n' Rawr Party, so don't forget.

31:06.505 --> 31:07.425
Oh, not Rock n' Rawr Party.

31:07.445 --> 31:08.546
Rawr in response.

31:08.566 --> 31:09.926
Close Rawr in response.

31:09.986 --> 31:10.946
Not Rock n' Rawr Party.

31:10.986 --> 31:13.347
Rawr in response.

31:13.447 --> 31:16.249
Don't get the Ruffians too excited, Moco-chan.

31:16.349 --> 31:19.190
But our next dream is...

31:19.910 --> 31:21.392
Super Mario Bros.

31:21.472 --> 31:23.835
Wonder!

31:24.315 --> 31:25.677
I'm really looking forward to it.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.740
It's our first Mario game together with you, Ruffians!

31:28.941 --> 31:32.264
Don't you love the beautiful thumbnail?

31:32.284 --> 31:33.426
Yes, very beautiful.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.629
At least we're Mario Bros Wonder.

31:37.649 --> 31:40.331
Super Mario Bros Wonder, Moco-chan.

31:40.492 --> 31:42.653
I apologize, I made a grave error.

31:43.114 --> 31:44.975
Super Mario Bros Wonder!

31:45.455 --> 31:51.600
We don't really have that much expectations, but we're just looking forward to having some pure Mario fun, you know?

31:52.081 --> 31:55.243
We hope that you'll join us as we both play it together!

31:55.703 --> 31:57.845
Both Moco-chan and I have a controller.

31:57.865 --> 31:59.306
Moco-chan has a controller.

32:00.527 --> 32:01.849
BAU BAU!

32:15.725 --> 32:16.446
No, not tonight.

32:16.466 --> 32:17.026
This weekend.

32:17.547 --> 32:21.330
But for the sports festival, we're on the Red Team!

32:21.510 --> 32:22.871
Akagumi!

32:22.911 --> 32:30.477
We had a lot of fun practicing with our senpai the other day, so even though it's a serious competition, we can't wait to have more fun together.

32:30.597 --> 32:31.177
You know it!

32:31.217 --> 32:36.041
Towa-senpai was really, really cool and so sweet too.

32:36.161 --> 32:38.623
We'd really like to be able to talk to him more.

32:40.826 --> 32:46.516
Moco-chan, do you think your shoulders are ready to carry Calli-senpai during the shoulder voice competition?

32:46.536 --> 32:47.137
I think we can do it.

32:47.177 --> 32:47.858
There's two of us.

32:47.959 --> 32:48.520
It'll be good.

32:48.540 --> 32:52.887
Yeah, the toll of death is heavy.

32:53.944 --> 32:55.626
Well, we'll give it our all!

32:55.646 --> 32:58.228
And we'll have lots of fun with it!

32:58.388 --> 33:03.612
I don't know, I feel like it's very appropriate for demon guard dogs to be carrying, you know?

33:03.732 --> 33:06.354
Yeah, true, true, true.

33:06.534 --> 33:07.735
We'll have to do our best!

33:08.155 --> 33:11.678
And then after that, we vaaaaa!

33:11.898 --> 33:12.639
BAU BAU!

33:12.679 --> 33:13.039
BAU BAU!

33:18.443 --> 33:24.849
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for the very first FUWAMOCO Morning of November!

33:25.289 --> 33:31.814
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

33:31.894 --> 33:33.696
Extra Special Ruffians!

33:33.976 --> 33:35.077
Passcode Events!

33:35.257 --> 33:36.698

33:36.778 --> 33:37.259

33:37.559 --> 33:39.261

33:40.041 --> 33:40.762

33:40.962 --> 33:42.483
BAU BAU!

33:43.904 --> 33:52.171
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

33:52.271 --> 33:55.673
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:56.054 --> 33:58.736
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

33:59.036 --> 34:00.077
BAU BAU!

34:13.387 --> 34:14.098
It's time for FUWAMOCO
