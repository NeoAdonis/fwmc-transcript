05:05.420 --> 05:07.842
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:08.262 --> 05:11.824
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:11.844 --> 05:16.086
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:16.146 --> 05:18.508
BAU BAU!

05:19.148 --> 05:21.869
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.250 --> 05:25.031
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:25.231 --> 05:27.973
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:28.013 --> 05:28.473
BAU BAU!

05:30.209 --> 05:35.033
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:35.193 --> 05:38.837
Thank you for waking up right early for us.

05:38.857 --> 05:39.958
Are you awake?

05:40.558 --> 05:41.259
I'm awake.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.121
For our 31st episode!

05:43.461 --> 05:47.605
BAU BAU BAU!

05:47.625 --> 05:49.547
Ruffians, you're awake, right?

05:49.947 --> 05:50.828
Okiteru?

05:51.088 --> 05:52.510
Is your brain moving?

05:53.863 --> 05:58.045
If you shake your head around enough, your brain will... It will start moving, okay?

05:58.085 --> 06:00.966
Just shake your head a bit!

06:01.827 --> 06:13.152
Well, for the Ruffians that are maybe joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:13.252 --> 06:13.833
A.K.A.

06:13.893 --> 06:14.813
FUWAMOCO!

06:15.033 --> 06:18.215
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:18.915 --> 06:20.056
I think it was good, huh?

06:21.316 --> 06:27.759
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:28.159 --> 06:33.362
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:33.522 --> 06:39.265
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:39.605 --> 06:42.026
BAU BAU!

06:42.086 --> 06:47.289
Well, to start our morning off, we have... Oh, you're pretty confident about this one, Moco-chan.

06:47.629 --> 06:49.229
Another... Pero Sighting.

06:51.401 --> 06:54.343
Where is Pero now this time?

06:54.383 --> 06:57.845
She's pretty free spirited, I think, nowadays.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.566
Where is he?

07:01.147 --> 07:02.808
De-den!

07:05.970 --> 07:11.813
It looks like a Ruffian was out in the yard the other day doing some work and mowing the lawn, but...

07:13.455 --> 07:19.806
They might have spotted Pero, but because what they found kind of looks like his broken bones.

07:27.546 --> 07:30.288
Happy Halloween!

07:30.308 --> 07:30.848
Spooky.

07:30.868 --> 07:31.849
Spooky.

07:31.869 --> 07:36.032
That's a funny joke to get us into the Halloween spirit, right?

07:36.272 --> 07:36.612
Right?

07:36.752 --> 07:37.173
Spooky.

07:37.193 --> 07:37.593
Spooky.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.175
Pero's weird, isn't he?

07:40.235 --> 07:41.976
Unfortunately, yeah.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.917
We're sure he's around somewhere.

07:44.057 --> 07:48.120
We just have to keep our eyes open for him.

07:48.180 --> 07:48.440
Yeah.

07:48.860 --> 07:56.225
No matter how much we punch and kick and stomp and throw him around, you know, he never seems to really take that much damage.

07:56.425 --> 07:56.626
No.

07:57.847 --> 08:07.383
You know, in the first place, are you really sure that this is Pero and not a bunny?

08:07.583 --> 08:11.390
That would be sad, but...

08:12.270 --> 08:19.594
You know, it's kind of blurry, but... But bunnies don't usually have purple on them, so it's okay.

08:19.894 --> 08:23.236
I'm sure it's just like a spooky Halloween joke, you know?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:24.676 --> 08:27.598
Thanks for the season's greetings, Ruffians!

08:29.059 --> 08:33.161
Please let us know if you think maybe you'll see Pero around again sometime soon.

08:33.521 --> 08:36.002
It's okay if maybe it was just a bunny in the end.

08:36.422 --> 08:37.263
It's okay, Chiyo.

08:37.303 --> 08:38.904
BAU BAU!

08:38.964 --> 08:40.345
BAU BAU!

08:42.746 --> 08:45.047
Must have been a bit of a bump, right?

08:45.267 --> 08:46.327
A little bit of a bump.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.408
He's a bit big, so maybe a big bump.

08:49.408 --> 08:50.528
Unless it was a bunny.

08:51.268 --> 08:52.269
BAU BAU!

08:52.689 --> 08:55.569
FUWAMOCO-chan, what kind of good news do we have today?

08:58.710 --> 09:02.131
We have... a confession.

09:02.891 --> 09:03.211
Yeah.

09:04.572 --> 09:04.812
Yeah.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.192
Well, Ruffians!

09:06.952 --> 09:08.053
Did you get much rest?

09:09.912 --> 09:10.332
Did you?

09:11.153 --> 09:12.053
Hopefully you did!

09:12.633 --> 09:14.854
And hopefully it was a very good one!

09:14.954 --> 09:26.539
Because, uh, yesterday... Yesterday, something unexpected happened that we have to confess about.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.781
Yesterday, we were playing Adventures of Cookie and Cream, right?

09:32.001 --> 09:32.262
Right!

09:33.763 --> 09:37.725
And it was our final stream, right?

09:38.006 --> 09:40.647
We just planned to finish off the last little bit of it.

09:40.707 --> 09:41.928
Yeah, just the last little bit.

09:41.968 --> 09:44.089
Yeah, because last time we got really far.

09:44.169 --> 09:47.451
We tried to complete it, but didn't quite finish it.

09:47.471 --> 09:50.453
So it shouldn't have been that bad, right?

09:51.554 --> 09:55.516
You know, we expected to play maybe two hours or so.

09:55.576 --> 09:55.996
Yeah.

09:56.737 --> 09:58.858
But how long did we play?

10:00.720 --> 10:01.501
Not two hours.

10:02.182 --> 10:02.482
No.

10:03.023 --> 10:03.884
Not three hours.

10:04.224 --> 10:04.785
No.

10:05.165 --> 10:05.485
Not four.

10:05.506 --> 10:05.746
Uh-uh.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.328
Not five.

10:07.488 --> 10:08.349
Not even five?

10:09.130 --> 10:12.353
Yesterday, we streamed for six and a half hours.

10:12.373 --> 10:13.495
Yeah.

10:13.975 --> 10:15.116
And it wasn't that simple.

10:16.032 --> 10:21.356
You know, you know, Ruffians, we had a duel with the crazy small hippos.

10:21.396 --> 10:24.999
We had the moon boss that had no attack pattern.

10:25.339 --> 10:29.262
But then, after we actually finished the game.

10:29.322 --> 10:31.384
We had already beat the game, you know it.

10:31.924 --> 10:36.447
We realized that we had unlocked something very fearsome.

10:37.668 --> 10:39.190
An extra bonus world.

10:41.155 --> 10:43.878
You know, we all thought, why not?

10:44.199 --> 10:45.801
We have to clear the morning's world.

10:46.201 --> 10:46.482
Right?

10:46.642 --> 10:47.403
It won't be bad.

10:47.423 --> 10:49.185
That was a mistake.

10:49.425 --> 10:49.605
Yep.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.690
Because it had the puzzle level.

10:54.672 --> 10:56.514
That awful, awful puzzle level.

10:58.376 --> 10:59.397
And it took us forever.

11:01.103 --> 11:08.169
You know, we really thought about stopping there and calling it quits because, you know, we already beat the game.

11:08.729 --> 11:10.411
It was just the extra bonus level.

11:11.152 --> 11:12.453
We hadn't had any dinner.

11:12.813 --> 11:13.033
No.

11:14.495 --> 11:14.915
Or lunch.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.019
My tummy.

11:21.040 --> 11:24.984
Yeah, Moco-chan's tummy was making a lot of sounds, Ruffians.

11:25.004 --> 11:26.125
I know.

11:28.086 --> 11:30.367
We needed to get to sleep too, you know it.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.768
But instead, we continued!

11:34.709 --> 11:36.510
And you saw, right Ruffians?

11:37.470 --> 11:42.652
You know, we tried getting hints and working all together on it on Twitter.

11:43.313 --> 11:47.414
But even then, it was tough.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.115
So you know it.

11:49.395 --> 11:51.196
Then we called in all of Advent.

11:51.756 --> 11:53.457
And we worked on it all together!

11:54.557 --> 11:55.658
And, guess what?

11:57.250 --> 11:57.990
Guess what?

12:00.112 --> 12:04.835
At the last second, we completed it!

12:04.875 --> 12:05.235
We did it!

12:05.275 --> 12:12.499
And thanks to you, we were able to clear all the stages of the bonus world and completely 100% clear the game!

12:12.560 --> 12:15.481
Yeah!

12:15.641 --> 12:17.863
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:18.183 --> 12:19.504
You're proud of us, right?

12:20.865 --> 12:21.105
Right.

12:25.983 --> 12:32.866
Because of all of this, we knew that there was also a sacrifice involved too.

12:35.087 --> 12:42.050
We knew the trade-off to persisting and trying to clear the game also meant that FUWAMOCO would definitely not get sleep.

12:43.211 --> 12:49.334
You know, homework still needs to be done, so sleep eluded us for a little bit longer.

12:51.220 --> 12:59.644
I didn't want to give up, you know, but we also weren't expecting to be fighting for so long against the bonus world.

13:02.205 --> 13:04.166
You weren't expecting that either, right?

13:04.986 --> 13:06.407
We're in it together, you know.

13:06.467 --> 13:12.270
I think for FUWAMOCO, for us, we aren't really like some of our senpai.

13:12.310 --> 13:15.711
Regular sleep is very important for us to function properly.

13:15.731 --> 13:18.713
And for the last few weeks,

13:20.143 --> 13:22.605
We've been kind of lucky to get four hours or so.

13:22.665 --> 13:27.087
So, I'm starting to feel it maybe a bit.

13:27.107 --> 13:27.908
Just a bit.

13:27.948 --> 13:29.909
Sometimes.

13:30.269 --> 13:35.412
So, for today, Ruffians, please give us lots of strength, okay?

13:35.993 --> 13:36.493
Okay.

13:37.313 --> 13:38.094
Ruffians!

13:38.734 --> 13:40.315
Power, please!

13:40.696 --> 13:41.936
Power!

13:43.197 --> 13:44.998
BAU BAU!

13:45.018 --> 13:46.139
You give us power, right?

13:47.017 --> 13:48.497
But it was worth it.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.318
It was really fun.

13:50.858 --> 13:52.358
Just unexpected fun.

13:54.539 --> 13:58.639
Well, surely you know, it's a new FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:58.659 --> 14:00.620
There'll be some good news, alright?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.040
Especially last time, there's so much good news!

14:04.120 --> 14:06.421
Well this time, we have this!

14:08.501 --> 14:09.582
Bad news.

14:13.402 --> 14:14.423
Bad news.

14:14.483 --> 14:15.163
Bad news.

14:19.636 --> 14:31.641
Our bad news is that the other day we were recording and no matter what, Fuwawa just couldn't stop biting her tongue.

14:32.601 --> 14:36.423
We had three different recordings of her saying, maybe we should have

14:37.554 --> 14:39.675
With an audible bite down on her tongue.

14:40.115 --> 14:41.235
It really hurt, Ruffians!

14:41.375 --> 14:49.398
Every single time she tried to retake it, it was like... I just couldn't stop crying.

14:49.838 --> 14:53.459
It's the first time that something like that happened to me, Ruffians!

14:53.479 --> 14:56.120
It was so frustrating!

14:56.140 --> 14:59.120
It was frustrating for me too!

14:59.180 --> 15:01.041
Take it again!

15:01.061 --> 15:03.922
Do you ever have times like that, Ruffians?

15:06.224 --> 15:15.634
I hope that I can get less tongue-tied like our senpai, you know, with years of experience and hopefully just have the words roll out of me with eloquence one day.

15:15.654 --> 15:17.896
Ah, eloquence and grace and style.

15:18.217 --> 15:26.346
Hopefully then the Ruffians will think, when they think eloquence and grace and style, they think of FUWAMOCO.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.161
Or maybe not for now.

15:30.382 --> 15:31.282
Did it taste good?

15:31.342 --> 15:33.544
Does your own tongue taste good?

15:34.304 --> 15:35.866
No, it's not like yutan.

15:36.306 --> 15:36.606
No.

15:38.528 --> 15:40.029
How does your tongue feel now though?

15:40.229 --> 15:40.909
It hurts.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.711
Is it still damaged?

15:43.171 --> 15:51.337
If I drink water, the tip of my tongue is like... Let's make sure our tongue doesn't go...

15:53.484 --> 15:53.964
Okay.

15:54.924 --> 15:56.125
Let's do better, okay?

15:56.145 --> 15:59.705
BAU BAU.

16:01.006 --> 16:02.906
Tongue is troublesome sometimes.

16:06.987 --> 16:08.607
You know what they say.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.768
That bad news comes in threes.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.989
Ruffians.

16:17.469 --> 16:21.150
At the very least, today comes in twos.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.250
You see, today...

16:23.402 --> 16:26.785
Another lightbulb has burnt out in the FUWAMOCO den.

16:28.587 --> 16:36.235
And this time, it's a rather crucial light that lets us see what we eat and brightens our workspace.

16:36.395 --> 16:40.879
So now we live in darkness with only three lights brightening up our space.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.564
Maybe it's finally time for us to try and change them back.

16:46.991 --> 16:56.675
Ruffians, can you help us change them without falling off the ladder or getting electrocuted or dropping the lightbulb and having it go everywhere?

16:57.595 --> 17:03.618
You know, it's now the time of the year where it's much more dark out too, so it's a bit of a downer, you know?

17:04.338 --> 17:07.039
I hope that somehow they get fixed soon.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.060
Yeah, somehow.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.742
I don't like ghosts, but if they fix the lightbulb then maybe.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.763
That would be permissible.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.070
Maybe hope is what changes lightbulbs.

17:18.490 --> 17:18.811
Right.

17:19.531 --> 17:20.512
We just have to hope.

17:21.052 --> 17:21.333
Hope.

17:21.513 --> 17:22.053
Not do it.

17:22.474 --> 17:22.914
Just hope.

17:24.215 --> 17:25.136
Just hope.

17:25.316 --> 17:26.657
Don't do, just hope.

17:27.538 --> 17:29.260
Is that how the lightbulb gets changed?

17:30.000 --> 17:30.280
Hope.

17:31.181 --> 17:32.703
Hope brightens up our day.

17:33.223 --> 17:36.005
Hope will change the lightbulbs and brighten up our room.

17:36.025 --> 17:36.326
Okay.

17:36.806 --> 17:37.186
Okay.

17:37.206 --> 17:37.467
Yeah.

17:38.087 --> 17:38.928
Makes sense, I guess.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.270
Solved!

17:41.570 --> 17:41.890
Solved!

17:44.841 --> 17:45.822
Somehow.

18:04.523 --> 18:10.569
And this time, it's truly, actually, really not our fault.

18:11.149 --> 18:12.090
It really isn't.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.372
You believe us, right, Ruffians?

18:16.974 --> 18:17.275
Right.

18:20.177 --> 18:23.601
You know, sometimes after a stream,

18:25.311 --> 18:29.373
What did Fuwawa say last stream that was so weird?

18:29.493 --> 18:30.454
I don't remember anything.

18:30.474 --> 18:32.235
And I'll watch and think, well...

18:49.639 --> 18:56.201
I guess if you take it out of context, maybe that could sound a little strange to some Ruffians.

18:57.941 --> 19:02.603
But recently, I've been seeing a bunch of videos!

19:03.843 --> 19:10.385
Especially from our last Sakura Wars 5 stream, where Taiga answers the phone with no clothes on.

19:10.405 --> 19:14.606
You know, for some reason,

19:16.030 --> 19:26.975
Multiple videos imply that Fuwawa wants to be in a state of undress rather than wear clothes.

19:27.515 --> 19:29.856
When she didn't say anything like that at all!

19:29.916 --> 19:31.097
I didn't say anything.

19:31.177 --> 19:33.498
I didn't say anything like that, Ruffians.

19:33.518 --> 19:33.638
No!

19:33.758 --> 19:35.579
Are your ears okay?

19:38.971 --> 19:45.336
You know, it was in the moment we were just both very taken aback by Taiga answering the phone with no clothes on.

19:45.376 --> 19:47.598
That's unthinkable.

19:47.738 --> 19:48.298
And you know what?

19:48.679 --> 19:57.986
Fuwawa is more confused by him saying that he needs to change his clothes, which then further implies that he wasn't wearing any, you know, to begin with.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.442
You know, we were just confused by the situation.

20:02.762 --> 20:04.344
It's not a normal situation.

20:04.364 --> 20:10.829
And you know, Fuwawa never said anything about enjoying being cool or not.

20:12.571 --> 20:19.296
I think Ruffians, I think Moco-chan would've realized a long time ago if I didn't wear clothes regularly, you know?

20:19.316 --> 20:20.417
Of course!

20:20.898 --> 20:22.699
I like my fluffy pajamas!

20:22.759 --> 20:23.520
They're cute!

20:25.261 --> 20:27.663
You know, Fuwawa says many silly things.

20:28.283 --> 20:31.065
And sometimes I say silly things.

20:31.926 --> 20:38.470
And sometimes, maybe sometimes, they can be misunderstood.

20:39.171 --> 20:39.331
But...

20:40.137 --> 20:42.839
This is a time where we're not at fault, truly.

20:42.859 --> 20:47.041
So please don't go making up misunderstandings, okay?

20:47.101 --> 20:47.601
Yeah.

20:47.781 --> 20:48.642
I think that's enough.

20:49.002 --> 20:55.245
We say enough silly things and we never mean for it to come out like how you might sometimes want to talk with them.

20:55.265 --> 20:57.046
Okay, Ruffians.

20:58.207 --> 21:00.528
Maybe Ruffians are just a bit silly, huh?

21:00.608 --> 21:02.069
Silly Ruffians.

21:03.210 --> 21:04.611
You understand though, right?

21:05.631 --> 21:06.412
Understood.

21:07.972 --> 21:08.633
Understood.

21:11.326 --> 21:12.167
I got it right.

21:14.268 --> 21:15.909
Dogenzan!

21:16.869 --> 21:18.150
It's not Iphone!

21:18.330 --> 21:19.391
I understood!

21:19.731 --> 21:26.214
Maybe you need like a mimikaki ASMR or something and then maybe you'll hear it a little bit better after that.

21:27.035 --> 21:27.395
Right.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.535
That's not up to us.

21:28.735 --> 21:29.416
Understood!

21:30.556 --> 21:31.177
Understood!

21:31.197 --> 21:32.658
Good.

21:32.698 --> 21:34.819
Good, good, good.

21:35.459 --> 21:35.999
I'm happy.

21:39.608 --> 21:41.381
BAU BAU!

21:43.477 --> 21:50.518
There are things that can get us quite worked up too.

22:12.543 --> 22:13.964
Grumpy FUWAMOCO.

22:16.107 --> 22:26.557
You know, for example, one thing that makes us exceedingly grumpy, you know, is this.

22:29.239 --> 22:30.360
People who budge in line.

22:31.894 --> 22:35.775
You know, we have a pretty strong sense of justice as demon guard dogs.

22:36.215 --> 22:39.056
You know, sometimes a bit to a fault.

22:39.936 --> 22:44.217
But we don't like being too aggressive unless it's really necessary.

22:44.657 --> 22:51.599
So especially if in line we see somebody budge in front of another person, not necessarily us.

22:52.557 --> 22:53.838
We get pretty grumpy.

22:53.978 --> 22:57.520
I think it's the worst if it's not us, if it's a different person.

22:57.540 --> 22:57.761
Right!

22:57.781 --> 23:01.483
I get angry on their behalf!

23:01.643 --> 23:06.406
But we do try to give the person that, like, what's the benefit of it, you know?

23:06.426 --> 23:08.848
And I think maybe like, oh, they're just confused.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.969
Maybe they just...

23:10.749 --> 23:13.912
It's just entirely clueless about the world around them.

23:13.952 --> 23:15.694
It's okay, sometimes it's like that.

23:15.914 --> 23:21.120
But even then it can still make us feel pretty hot sometimes.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.921
So RuffianS!

23:23.122 --> 23:29.668
Please try to be aware about the world around you so that you don't accidentally budge a line, okay?

23:30.689 --> 23:32.611
You wouldn't want to make us grumpy, right?

23:32.631 --> 23:35.874
But I feel like if someone says, Oh, excuse me.

23:35.894 --> 23:36.875
I'm in a rush.

23:36.935 --> 23:38.557
Is it okay if I go in front of you?

23:38.617 --> 23:39.278
Please go ahead.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.238
That's totally fine.

23:40.278 --> 23:40.859
You asked.

23:41.199 --> 23:42.481
You gave a reason.

23:42.541 --> 23:43.321
That's fine.

23:44.102 --> 23:45.243
I'd be happy to.

23:45.283 --> 23:45.584
Yes.

23:46.004 --> 23:46.224
But...

23:47.185 --> 23:48.625
You have to communicate.

23:50.526 --> 23:51.226
Use manner.

23:51.646 --> 23:59.088
Otherwise, we're gonna be grumpy and you know, we wouldn't want to have to BAU BAU you back into your proper sport and life, right?

23:59.128 --> 24:00.448
You wouldn't want that, huh?

24:00.628 --> 24:01.029
Right?

24:01.709 --> 24:02.489
Okay, right.

24:02.709 --> 24:06.370
It's really important to pay attention and be kind to others, okay?

24:06.390 --> 24:06.470
Yeah.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.010
Be understanding.

24:08.650 --> 24:10.431
But, it makes us grumpy.

24:10.751 --> 24:11.331
Grumpy.

24:11.971 --> 24:14.532
Grumpy FUWAMOCO and people budget line!

24:19.156 --> 24:20.677
Not many things make us grumpy.

24:20.837 --> 24:22.278
But that's one of them.

24:22.818 --> 24:25.119
Maybe you'll find out the other ones.

24:27.961 --> 24:30.223
Well, it's Wednesday.

24:31.003 --> 24:31.424
It is.

24:32.164 --> 24:36.227
And I think the Ruffians have been trying hard.

24:36.947 --> 24:39.449
So I wanted to say something!

24:39.549 --> 24:39.869
Hi.

24:47.177 --> 24:48.057
Good morning!

24:48.077 --> 24:52.839
Good morning!

24:53.600 --> 24:54.940
You know who I am.

24:56.901 --> 24:59.582
It's me, Mococo!

25:00.402 --> 25:01.923
And you know what I'm about to say.

25:01.943 --> 25:02.023
Yeah!

25:06.645 --> 25:09.766
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

25:10.807 --> 25:13.187
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

25:14.963 --> 25:17.708
You know, I know the days are getting shorter.

25:18.530 --> 25:22.478
The sun comes up later, it leaves our side earlier.

25:23.279 --> 25:26.866
You know, it can be hard to keep your eyes open sometimes.

25:28.123 --> 25:28.463
BAU!

25:29.425 --> 25:31.347
I'll be your ice-cold shower!

25:31.987 --> 25:32.288
BAU!

25:32.868 --> 25:34.590
Your nice warm shower!

25:35.091 --> 25:36.332
Whichever you need, okay?

25:37.233 --> 25:41.158
And you know, despite all the changes around us, you're still continuing on!

25:41.638 --> 25:43.480
Continuing BAU BAU-ing!

25:44.121 --> 25:46.644
Because it's business as usual.

25:47.144 --> 25:47.345
Right?

25:49.031 --> 25:50.012
You can do it!

25:50.452 --> 25:51.393
I know you can!

25:52.133 --> 25:59.317
Even if things get tough, and it takes more time, and you feel like you aren't as efficient as usual, don't worry!

25:59.818 --> 26:04.060
You're doing your best, and that's leagues better than not doing anything.

26:05.281 --> 26:11.865
You know, one step a day is seven steps a week, and within no time, you'll be somewhere new.

26:12.566 --> 26:15.587
So don't worry, and just continue on!

26:16.588 --> 26:18.249
I believe you'll be all okay!

26:18.269 --> 26:19.950
Let's do it together, okay?

26:20.591 --> 26:22.052
Stay strong!

26:23.352 --> 26:29.036
But first, let's take a deep breath and BAU BAU together, okay?

26:29.897 --> 26:30.257
You good?

26:31.478 --> 26:35.480
Okay, here we go.

26:36.681 --> 26:40.764
3... 2... 1... BAU BAU!

26:40.784 --> 26:41.904
See ya!

26:42.465 --> 26:43.986
We believe in you!

26:44.446 --> 26:45.367
Ganbatte ne!

26:48.831 --> 26:49.272
BAU BAU!

26:59.352 --> 27:04.214
Well, maybe we should check out our regular coordinates for the day, Moco-chan!

27:04.614 --> 27:06.995
This is the Doggie of the Day!

27:07.075 --> 27:09.215
Who is our doggy today?

27:10.556 --> 27:13.177
It's Reggie!

27:14.537 --> 27:21.859
Reggie is a sleepy little chub who puts a priority on getting a good night and a day's rest.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.180
I respect that.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.300
I appreciate that.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.361
Look, Reggie's giving me a look like,

27:26.681 --> 27:27.462
I'm sleeping here.

27:27.482 --> 27:30.003
Why are you taking a photo of me?

27:30.864 --> 27:33.766
It's good to get lots of sleep.

27:38.009 --> 27:42.432
I think it would be hard getting out of bed when your dog bed looks as comfy as that one too.

27:45.354 --> 27:48.377
Reggie look very cute and very comfy.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.060
How do you think Reggie BAU BAU is?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.741
Is he sleepy head?

27:54.041 --> 27:57.364
He only lets out a little bark to let you know he's around?

27:57.404 --> 27:58.405
Like don't step on me.

28:04.336 --> 28:18.367
You know, Regi, he might be off in dreamland often, but I think that's just because he's trying to set a good example for you.

28:18.528 --> 28:19.608
Exactly.

28:19.628 --> 28:20.950
Good example, Regi.

28:21.450 --> 28:25.974
He thinks maybe that you work a bit too hard and that you need to stop

28:26.414 --> 28:29.616
Need to curl up for a good rest together, you know?

28:29.636 --> 28:31.357
Together with him!

28:31.417 --> 28:31.697
Right?

28:32.017 --> 28:34.599
So, Ruffian, what are you waiting for?

28:35.319 --> 28:41.043
Go curl up with Regi and have sweet tea!

28:41.263 --> 28:42.144
Extra rest for.

28:42.544 --> 28:42.884
Right?

28:42.964 --> 28:45.946
BAU BAU!

28:46.126 --> 28:49.148
Today, I went for a walk.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.452
Where did this Ruffian go for a walk?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.934
De-den!

28:57.075 --> 28:58.757
Look at the dragonfly!

28:58.817 --> 29:01.199
It's so beautiful!

29:01.419 --> 29:03.380
It's kinda chunky like Regi too, huh?

29:04.421 --> 29:05.322
I guess kind of.

29:05.442 --> 29:09.665
Usually dragonflies are a bit more, like, I don't know, graceful.

29:09.986 --> 29:10.586
Graceful!

29:15.832 --> 29:18.896
I think that's pretty graceful.

29:18.936 --> 29:20.439
He's like a sun dragonfly.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.242
I guess, I guess.

29:22.462 --> 29:25.447
But you know dragonflies, they're pretty cool but...

29:27.268 --> 29:34.717
I'm kind of scared of them, Mococchan and I. You know, they're big and they fly around and around eye-high.

29:34.857 --> 29:38.322
And then, you know, they never seem to know where they're going either.

29:38.342 --> 29:40.765
They're just... Right.

29:41.105 --> 29:43.047
I don't want them to bash into us.

29:43.608 --> 29:44.309
You know it.

29:44.970 --> 29:46.151
They can bite hard too.

29:47.768 --> 29:49.509
I still remember.

29:50.729 --> 29:51.810
I keep my distance.

29:52.770 --> 29:56.772
But it looks like you were safe because he's blinded and not moving around.

29:57.072 --> 30:00.374
He's alive though, right?

30:00.414 --> 30:04.135
We're glad that you spotted a really cool giant right there!

30:04.175 --> 30:06.156
Just keep your distance.

30:06.536 --> 30:11.279
But you really never know what kind of cool things you'll stumble across when you go out for a walk, right?

30:11.339 --> 30:11.659
Right!

30:12.950 --> 30:17.771
You know, the other day, I was sitting like this Ruffian, and I saw a worm.

30:18.232 --> 30:19.272
I was pretty excited.

30:20.112 --> 30:20.632
A worm?

30:20.732 --> 30:21.012
Yeah.

30:21.533 --> 30:23.373
I thought that it's a pretty big worm.

30:23.873 --> 30:24.554
I was impressed.

30:26.854 --> 30:28.095
Worms can be impressive.

30:28.115 --> 30:28.835
They can be.

30:28.915 --> 30:32.456
Worms are doing their thing.

30:32.976 --> 30:34.757
BAU BAU!

30:36.957 --> 30:38.738
And for our Question of the Day!

30:39.963 --> 30:42.985
We have... De-den!

30:43.365 --> 30:46.066
I, FUWAMOCO, have reached 100,000 videos on the channel!

30:46.106 --> 30:46.546
Thank you!

30:46.586 --> 30:48.047
Thank you!

30:48.107 --> 30:53.570
I wonder which stream was the most challenging to prepare for so far, other than debut, of course.

30:53.870 --> 30:55.391
And which was the most rewarding?

30:55.431 --> 30:56.051
BAU BAU!

30:56.191 --> 30:57.832
BAU BAU!

30:57.852 --> 30:59.693
Ah, this is a good question.

31:00.834 --> 31:08.518
Obviously, there's a lot of preparation going on in the back for a lot of things that you might not notice, Ruffians, but- You're not supposed to.

31:08.638 --> 31:10.179
You're not supposed to, that's okay.

31:10.619 --> 31:14.841
But, by far, FUWAMOCO Morning is the most demanding!

31:15.022 --> 31:16.082
Yeah.

31:17.823 --> 31:18.383
Surprised?

31:19.884 --> 31:28.208
You may think it's just 30 minutes, but it actually takes much, much more time than that to prepare!

31:28.729 --> 31:29.069
Yeah.

31:30.393 --> 31:36.718
You know, we wake up three hours before every FUWAMOCO Morning to continue preparing everything.

31:36.738 --> 31:40.560
And then we separate the tasks amongst ourselves too, you know.

31:40.780 --> 31:48.226
It takes a lot of work and preparation to be able to meet you early like this almost every other day of the week.

31:48.306 --> 31:52.188
But I think it's worth it to make your day a little brighter.

31:52.969 --> 31:56.812
You know, especially before you have all those rough parts each day.

31:57.052 --> 31:59.814
Yeah, so it means a lot when

32:00.314 --> 32:02.536
We hear that FUWAMOCO means a lot to you too.

32:02.576 --> 32:03.496
FUWAMOCO Morning!

32:04.117 --> 32:06.138
Ah, yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

32:06.178 --> 32:08.960
But also FUWAMOCO means a lot to you too.

32:09.640 --> 32:09.820
Yeah.

32:10.341 --> 32:19.286
But otherwise, we maybe like to have some more prep-heavy streams that involve more homework that we'd like to do in the future.

32:20.027 --> 32:25.831
But, again, it takes a lot of work so it's hard to balance with everything else we have going on too.

32:26.894 --> 32:27.174
What?

32:29.456 --> 32:29.856
Balance.

32:30.757 --> 32:31.937
It's tricky, you know?

32:32.038 --> 32:35.700
But we'll continue working hard!

32:36.200 --> 32:37.942
BAU BAU!

32:38.002 --> 32:41.604
Thank you for all your submissions today too!

32:42.044 --> 32:44.506
We're always looking forward to all your updates.

32:44.766 --> 32:47.768
For more questions, questions, questions, questions.

32:47.828 --> 32:48.609
For more vlogs.

32:49.850 --> 32:51.330
Thank you.

32:51.370 --> 32:57.632
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make all together, Ruffians, so don't forget that, okay?

32:57.652 --> 32:59.832
BAU BAU!

32:59.852 --> 33:03.053
Why don't we take a peek at our next stream?

33:03.233 --> 33:12.275
Our next stream is, if you know today, the day of the week, it is time for Resident Evil 4 Wednesday!

33:13.535 --> 33:16.196
We're back to Resident Evil 4.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.759
Yeah, we're playing the remake.

33:19.879 --> 33:24.507
We just made it back to the village and are going to head inside the church.

33:25.008 --> 33:30.336
You know, the church where all the grandmas and grandpas headed in, so they're so, so hurried.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.899
I don't know why.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.891
Then we're gonna hurt us really badly and then it's like, no!

33:36.732 --> 33:37.392
It's great.

33:37.912 --> 33:38.653
Don't question.

33:38.673 --> 33:41.514
But hopefully things don't get too much scarier.

33:41.974 --> 33:44.256
And also hopefully Moco-chan gets better at shooting.

33:46.076 --> 33:53.180
But also, make sure that you're logged in and are all enough Ruffians to watch, okay?

33:53.240 --> 34:00.263
It can be a little scary at times, so... But if you can't watch, what else do we have?

34:00.323 --> 34:01.084
Well...

34:02.024 --> 34:02.424
That's all.

34:02.604 --> 34:03.005
That's all.

34:29.375 --> 34:29.895
BAU BAU!

34:29.955 --> 34:31.836
BAU BAU!

34:32.957 --> 34:34.277
Wow, Ruffians.

34:34.297 --> 34:40.200
That brings our 31st FUWAMOCO Morning to an end.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.302
Thank you so much for joining us today this morning!

34:44.342 --> 34:51.465
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

34:51.826 --> 34:53.206
Baby Tortilla!

34:53.546 --> 34:55.567

34:55.687 --> 34:56.488

35:19.432 --> 35:28.558
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

35:28.578 --> 35:32.321
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:32.501 --> 35:34.022
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

35:34.102 --> 35:35.303
