00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.750
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.928
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:09.948 --> 00:05:12.972
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimari yo!

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.882
Ruffians, what did you think of our new jingle?

00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:21.863
Thank you so much, Aina!

00:05:21.943 --> 00:05:23.183
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:27.406
For introductions, I'm Nanachihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:29.907
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.628
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:34.150
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.092
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:43.135
Thank you for joining us today for our 18th episode!

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:45.255
BAU BAU BAU BAU.

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:47.456
18 episodes.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:48.456
18.

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:55.338
Well, Ruffians, you know, I saw a couple Ruffians that maybe this was their first time for FUWAMOCO Morning today.

00:05:55.718 --> 00:06:01.439
So to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it is a short format morning show.

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.600
And it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.180
A.k.a.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.900
FUWAMOCO.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.441
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:14.505
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:18.608
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag "hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning".

00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:20.169
FWMCMorning.

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:25.012
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:25.032 --> 00:06:28.375
BAU BAU!

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:35.160
So first, we have another Pero Sighting.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.986
Another Ruffian found Pero.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.148
This is good.

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:42.912
This is good, but let's see.

00:06:44.748 --> 00:06:45.248
Oh!

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:45.788
Oh!

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.289
Cute!

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.770
Pero was spotted in a UFO catcher!

00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:53.791
That's pretty fun.

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.172
Don't bother fishing it out!

00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:00.773
You know, look, there's the cute blue monster in the front.

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:03.034
There's so many better things than him in real life.

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:06.495
Yeah, like the white alien with the pretty pink toes.

00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:08.236
Maybe grab those instead.

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:09.216
The pink toes.

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:10.537
Yeah, you know.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.998
Actually, Ruffians, here's a gift.

00:07:13.338 --> 00:07:14.159
Windows for us.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.801
Not Pero.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:17.561
Not Pero.

00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.102
The other ones.

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:19.303
The other ones, the cute ones.

00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:21.424
You know, the ones that actually have value to them.

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:23.646
Those ones, you know.

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:28.509
Although, you know, we're actually pretty strong when it comes to UFO catchers, okay?

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:33.132
Yeah, we really, really, really like UFO catchers.

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:36.096
Have you done that before, Ruffians?

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.950
We haven't.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.570
No.

00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:50.391
We've never.

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:51.731
We'd like to try though.

00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:53.552
Right, we'd like to try it together with you.

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:55.273
It just seems dangerous.

00:07:55.373 --> 00:08:00.335
Yeah, you know we've never done it because we always feel like we might get a bit hooked.

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:07.158
But I think when it comes to UFO catches, we really like to win the cute plushies the most, you know?

00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:15.803
Sometimes, you know, we try to watch some videos on YouTube to learn all the tricks from special YouTubers who do that sort of stuff.

00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:19.646
But I think the kind of trick is you have to use your brain.

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:22.067
You have to think of interesting ways to win a bet.

00:08:22.207 --> 00:08:24.729
Yeah, you have to look at all the corners and stuff, right?

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.210
That's what makes it really fun.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:32.153
And then sometimes, when you win, you can make new cute friends.

00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:34.855
That's why they're the best, you know?

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:39.778
I hope that we can enjoy UFO Catches all together sometime.

00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:41.619
But, yeah, Pero.

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:42.499
Pero, right?

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.720
He's important.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.921
He's in this photo, right?

00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:48.083
He can just kinda stay there, right?

00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:49.003
Yeah, he can hang out.

00:08:49.103 --> 00:08:49.664
It'll be good.

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:51.605
Oh, he makes a good pushy.

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:54.907
Maybe, you know, he'll find a layout soon.

00:08:55.507 --> 00:08:59.929
Maybe some poor kid comes along and fishes him out?

00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:00.950
That's too bad for them.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.131
I think any other prize would be better.

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:05.232
Maybe no prize might be better.

00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:07.853
Ruffians!

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:12.375
Please let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

00:09:12.775 --> 00:09:17.377
Remember to use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:20.599
BAU BAU!

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:23.220
And today we actually have some

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.902
HAPPY NEWS!

00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:28.243
Yeah, happy news.

00:09:28.323 --> 00:09:37.730
You know, yesterday, after our Donkey Kong Country stream, we happened to pop into Mumei's stream to tell her she was joining us and all of Abyss!

00:09:38.051 --> 00:09:39.071
Ruffians, did you see?

00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.592
Did you see?

00:09:39.852 --> 00:09:44.795
We kind of redirected into Mumei's stream, but still... But we didn't expect that.

00:09:45.516 --> 00:09:45.856
Right?

00:09:46.257 --> 00:09:46.497
Right?

00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:51.480
We were really so, so, so, so happy to be able to do that, you know?

00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:55.643
Mumei-senpai's drawings are really amazing.

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:02.026
Actually, kinda really scare us too.

00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:03.306
They scare me!

00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:08.649
Do you remember how Mumei-senpai's special scare does?

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:11.410
A boy in holo-cure.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.472
It was really really really scary.

00:10:16.692 --> 00:10:19.574
Maybe Moco-chan, let's see how the illustrations are going.

00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:24.633
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:10:24.673 --> 00:10:25.193
Nightmares!

00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:41.069
Oh well, Mumei-senpai said you know that they have like a strong soccer dog mom feeling to them, right?

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:53.923
I don't know what to think about that, but... Maybe, you know, one day this is what Moco-chan will look like when she has a team full of puppies and I have my own team of puppies and we could, you know, battle them out.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.384
Against each other in a game of soccer.

00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:57.505
Right.

00:10:57.885 --> 00:10:59.866
He's gonna sound like Pokemon.

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:02.768
Really?

00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:03.749
I don't know.

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:06.750
Maybe it's a bit more like a nightmare?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.391
Or a strange dream?

00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:09.672
A strange dream at least.

00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:10.913
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:11:10.953 --> 00:11:11.453
Which one?

00:11:11.473 --> 00:11:16.736
Is she violent?

00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:17.677
Well, you know.

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.018
Might get that really good.

00:11:20.038 --> 00:11:20.158
Huh?

00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:25.269
It'd be good if this stayed a dream.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.092
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:30.695
Ruffians are okay with it though.

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:33.417
I don't want to have a team of puppies.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.861
No team of puppies?

00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:38.522
No reality, not like this.

00:11:38.742 --> 00:11:41.485
How many puppies would you need to fill a soccer team?

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:45.789
How many members are on a soccer team?

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.930
Ten or more.

00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:50.722
Eleven.

00:11:50.962 --> 00:11:52.943
Why is it not an even number?

00:11:53.663 --> 00:11:55.404
I don't like that.

00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:58.025
Yeah, this doesn't need to be reality.

00:12:00.527 --> 00:12:01.227
BAU BAU!

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:02.928
Thank you Mumei-senpai!

00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:06.230
We're looking forward to it.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.892
BAU BAU!

00:12:09.952 --> 00:12:12.553
And that was our happy news.

00:12:12.573 --> 00:12:14.734
Good to start the day with some happy news.

00:12:14.754 --> 00:12:16.315
What comes with happy news?

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.456
More happy news, right?

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:18.671
Sad news.

00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:31.531
Ruffians.

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:35.214
So also, yesterday.

00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:38.176
The good news happened and the bad news happened both yesterday.

00:12:38.296 --> 00:12:41.418
There was a casualty!

00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:42.278
A death!

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.300
I know we talked about no casualties, but there was.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.481
There was, yeah.

00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:48.402
Moco-chan's chair.

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:52.165
It was a sacrifice to Donkey Kong.

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:57.940
I died that one time and then I became one with the floor.

00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:14.322
I got back up, but then I broke the arm of my chair off.

00:13:15.883 --> 00:13:24.885
You know, all the screws just fell out and I tried fixing it today because it's really bugging me, but I don't have the screwdriver that works for it.

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:28.467
The screws.

00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:31.269
That's what a screwdriver does.

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:34.831
So they just keep on falling out after I try to screw them in with my hands.

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:38.574
I'm doing my best but it's not working.

00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:47.479
And you know, to be honest, the other arm, the arm that I still have, it's only held in by one screw too.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.543
So, I might end up with no arms very soon.

00:13:54.886 --> 00:13:57.491
It's just a seat at that point, right?

00:13:57.511 --> 00:13:58.132
It's just a seat.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:01.578
Hopefully I'm still left with a seat.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.104
But hopefully I can fix it soon.

00:14:07.298 --> 00:14:11.620
You know, it's important to have a good, proper chair for your health, Ruffians.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.141
Yeah, at least have a good seat with a back.

00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:20.542
Yeah, let's focus on the half because it still has the bottom part of the seat.

00:14:20.582 --> 00:14:22.663
Yeah, and I still have my arms.

00:14:22.923 --> 00:14:28.025
My chair might not have much arms left, but I still have my arms.

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:31.359
I didn't try to break it.

00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:33.400
He gave up.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.640
He fell apart.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.440
It's Donkey Kong's fault, right?

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.981
He was... He was... Yeah, that's it.

00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:41.601
Good luck, chair!

00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:44.161
Good luck, chair!

00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:45.662
Good luck, me!

00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:50.623
BAU BAU!

00:14:50.643 --> 00:14:56.584
Actually, the sad news doesn't just stop there.

00:14:57.784 --> 00:14:58.804
There's been

00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:03.104
Another misunderstanding.

00:15:04.846 --> 00:15:07.068
And this one is pretty big.

00:15:07.248 --> 00:15:11.592
Yeah, you know, it's a very serious misunderstanding.

00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:18.238
Something, you know, something we absolutely, at all costs, must clear up with you Ruffians, okay?

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:24.004
It's something that's been happening here on every single FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:15:24.264 --> 00:15:24.865
Something bad.

00:15:25.552 --> 00:15:26.893
Almost every episode.

00:15:26.953 --> 00:15:28.073
You didn't even notice.

00:15:28.153 --> 00:15:30.774
Yeah, we just kinda kept it hidden from you, you know?

00:15:31.595 --> 00:15:36.937
Yeah, so... Today... We're going to FINALLY clear it up!

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:38.418
Is that okay?

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:40.078
You didn't know.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.020
But we're gonna break it to you.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.921
Don't be too shocked, okay?

00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:48.042
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:15:49.409 --> 00:15:54.772
It's only supposed to be 20 minutes!

00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:57.013
20 minutes, but only 20 minutes long.

00:15:57.033 --> 00:16:00.335
Most often it's more like 40 minutes, right?

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:06.538
You know, our shortest one was 32 minutes!

00:16:06.578 --> 00:16:08.259
It's supposed to be 20!

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.500
But it's kinda close to the goal, you know?

00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:11.321
Is it?

00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:18.350
But recently it's been getting longer and longer and longer and longer.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.512
You know, I think last time was 48 minutes.

00:16:21.652 --> 00:16:23.453
Yeah, that's almost 50 minutes.

00:16:23.493 --> 00:16:27.536
That's like two episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning in one, right?

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:27.976
Right.

00:16:29.577 --> 00:16:30.858
It's only 20 minutes.

00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:31.398
Yeah.

00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:34.180
So, Ruffians, we want you to understand.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.482
FUWAMOCO Morning is supposed to be only 20 minutes long.

00:16:40.864 --> 00:16:42.385
Whether we'll actually get there though,

00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:44.557
That's the next question.

00:16:44.577 --> 00:16:45.738
That's up to us, right?

00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:47.839
It's up to FUWAMOCO!

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:50.800
We'll do our best.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.461
But... I don't know how good we can do.

00:16:57.202 --> 00:16:59.883
Thank you Ruffians for believing in us, right?

00:16:59.923 --> 00:17:01.383
You believe in us, right?

00:17:01.744 --> 00:17:02.504
We can do it!

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:10.609
Let's continue!

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:11.149
Okay!

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.671
Okay!

00:17:14.152 --> 00:17:17.114
Well, next we have something new.

00:17:17.134 --> 00:17:18.855
We have a challenge.

00:17:19.195 --> 00:17:27.642
Today's challenge is not just trying to get FUWAMOCO Morning to be 20 minutes, but today we're going to start our day with this.

00:17:27.802 --> 00:17:28.642
Something new.

00:17:29.563 --> 00:17:30.223
You know, because

00:17:31.164 --> 00:17:33.788
It's good to challenge ourselves to something new every day.

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:36.793
Particularly this challenge is for Moco-chan, you know?

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:43.122
Ruffians, you know, I told you before that I really, really like to eat.

00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:45.502
Natto in the morning.

00:17:45.562 --> 00:17:46.763
I have it every day.

00:17:46.783 --> 00:17:51.346
And if you don't know what natto is, it's fermented soybeans.

00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:55.048
And you know, it's really, really, really healthy for you.

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:58.791
It's like a superfood among superfoods.

00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:01.432
Maybe it's a little bit slimy.

00:18:01.973 --> 00:18:05.135
Maybe it's a little bit... It has a bit of a scent to it.

00:18:05.996 --> 00:18:06.776
A scent.

00:18:06.996 --> 00:18:09.418
Yeah, maybe some people might say it's a bit... Pungency.

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:12.010
It has a scent to it, you know?

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.412
It's not the worst part.

00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:14.973
It's full of vitamin K2!

00:18:15.473 --> 00:18:17.455
And it's really good for you.

00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:20.438
You know, Moco-chan, you don't really like it, right?

00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:22.560
I like it!

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.922
I want to like it, but I can't.

00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:28.666
But Ruffians, Moco-chan's tummy is really important, right?

00:18:30.101 --> 00:18:31.582
Your tummy is important too.

00:18:32.702 --> 00:18:35.843
My tummy is good because I eat natto every day.

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:41.105
But you know, it's been hurting with all the screaming and the scary stuff.

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:43.986
And playing a lot of intense games, right?

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:49.348
So today, I thought that this would be the day that Moco-chan eats natto.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.669
Conquer the natto, right?

00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:52.089
I have to conquer it today.

00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:55.391
I thought it would be like a, let's try, let's get there.

00:18:55.491 --> 00:18:56.151
Today's the day.

00:18:56.571 --> 00:18:57.353
Today's the day.

00:18:57.493 --> 00:18:58.795
I'm gonna slowly, okay?

00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:00.377
I'm gonna do my best, okay?

00:19:00.397 --> 00:19:02.360
I'm not gonna... I can't do it all.

00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:05.085
So we have one pack here with us today.

00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:06.948
I gotta do the thing, I gotta do the thing.

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:15.861
Moco-chan's gonna do her best to eat all 50 grams of it.

00:19:16.282 --> 00:19:18.163
It's from Tochigi Prefecture.

00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:19.944
Tochigi, thank you.

00:19:19.984 --> 00:19:21.165
Thank you, Tochigi.

00:19:21.886 --> 00:19:24.788
But if Moco-chan doesn't eat it all, I will!

00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:26.289
Okay, Moco-chan, here we go!

00:19:29.574 --> 00:19:31.294
Okay.

00:19:31.374 --> 00:19:31.995
Eat some more.

00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:36.416
And we're gonna eat it without any tare, no sauce.

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.056
No mustard.

00:19:37.076 --> 00:19:38.216
I have a tissue.

00:19:38.896 --> 00:19:42.297
I'm prepared.

00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:46.158
It looks delicious.

00:19:46.178 --> 00:19:47.938
Okay.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:51.699
Moco-chan!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.940
You have to do the stuff, okay?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.841
Ruffians, should I stir it up lots for Moco-chan?

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:55.822
No, no, I don't want it to be fluffy!

00:19:55.842 --> 00:19:56.942
You get more vitamins!

00:19:57.022 --> 00:19:58.043
No, I don't want it fluffy!

00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:58.963
It was fluffy with vitamins!

00:19:59.003 --> 00:20:01.245
Let me have it not fluffy first, okay?

00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:03.786
Okay, Moco-chan, do you need me to feed it to you?

00:20:04.647 --> 00:20:04.927
No.

00:20:05.307 --> 00:20:05.587
No?

00:20:05.847 --> 00:20:06.508
You're gonna do it?

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:07.568
I'm gonna try.

00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:09.189
I can't say if I'm gonna do it or not.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:10.510
Maybe I'll make it a bit easier.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.991
I'll take this side off for you, okay?

00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:12.271
Okay.

00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:25.385
Because the natto is really slimy and sticky and there's kind of like strings.

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:27.047
Like magical strings that are made.

00:20:27.107 --> 00:20:28.027
Magical strings.

00:20:28.107 --> 00:20:28.468
Yeah.

00:20:28.908 --> 00:20:32.491
And see if it touches your lips or like the chest or anything.

00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:33.052
I hate it!

00:20:33.092 --> 00:20:34.733
Don't say that that's rude, Moco-chan!

00:20:34.753 --> 00:20:35.854
Thank you, Tochigi!

00:20:38.116 --> 00:20:39.237
And it's really good.

00:20:39.717 --> 00:20:42.479
It's when it's still on my lips after eating it.

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:45.846
What does it smell like, Moco-chan?

00:20:46.026 --> 00:20:47.186
I can't smell anything.

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.827
My nose is broken, so this is good.

00:20:49.847 --> 00:20:51.287
Oh, this should be easy, then.

00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:59.791
I think it smells kind of like... The whole studio should be just smelling like natto, but I don't smell anything, so this is good.

00:21:00.231 --> 00:21:00.991
I'm hungry.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:02.311
Can you eat it, Moco-chan?

00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:03.432
You just have one bean!

00:21:03.452 --> 00:21:04.492
I have one bean!

00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:05.653
Okay, I have one bean.

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:06.253
I'm prepared.

00:21:06.313 --> 00:21:07.573
Are you scared of one bean?

00:21:07.713 --> 00:21:08.934
I'm preparing my heart!

00:21:09.014 --> 00:21:09.454
Okay!

00:21:09.474 --> 00:21:10.374
Okay.

00:21:10.734 --> 00:21:11.215
Ruffians.

00:21:12.455 --> 00:21:13.735
You're gonna cheer for me, right?

00:21:13.755 --> 00:21:17.156
Moco-chan's gonna eat the one single natto bean.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.737
This will be a good improvement.

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:19.217
Okay.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:20.237
It's not even fluffy.

00:21:20.517 --> 00:21:21.398
It's not fluffy yet.

00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:22.198
Okay.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:23.538
I'm gonna try it.

00:21:23.798 --> 00:21:25.539
Can you get my tissue ready just in case?

00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:27.139
I'm worried, okay?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.360
It's a tissue, not a bucket.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.700
Okay.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.602
Should I put it on my tongue, or just... Ah, you should eat it.

00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:34.882
That's the way.

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:37.243
Eat it, and then we'll eat more.

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:40.305
No, just eat it.

00:21:40.505 --> 00:21:40.685
Ah.

00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:41.765
You can't just swallow it.

00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:43.846
You have to make sure you savor it.

00:21:45.947 --> 00:21:46.407
Okay!

00:21:47.148 --> 00:21:47.888
Here we go!

00:21:48.168 --> 00:21:50.929
I'm gonna put it on the very back of my mouth.

00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:52.230
You need to taste it.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.011
No, this is getting ready.

00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:56.152
It's a small step, okay?

00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:57.292
Okay.

00:21:57.712 --> 00:21:58.773
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:01.247
Oh, now I can smell it.

00:22:01.267 --> 00:22:02.948
But I feel like I'm a bit more used to it.

00:22:02.968 --> 00:22:04.128
Because I smell it so often.

00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:04.948
So it's not that bad.

00:22:05.108 --> 00:22:05.388
Okay.

00:22:05.828 --> 00:22:06.208
Three!

00:22:06.308 --> 00:22:07.029
I'm not psyched!

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:08.949
Three!

00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:09.729
Two!

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:11.590
No, no, no, I want... From ten.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.730
From ten?

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.231
Okay, Ruffians, let's all do it together, okay?

00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:16.131
From ten.

00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:17.031
Ten!

00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:18.171
Nine!

00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:19.212
Eight!

00:22:19.852 --> 00:22:20.392
Seven!

00:22:20.932 --> 00:22:21.252
Six!

00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:22.512
Five!

00:22:23.053 --> 00:22:23.573
Four!

00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:24.613
Three!

00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:25.513
Two!

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:26.673
One!

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:28.054
I'm out!

00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:35.544
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:22:47.062 --> 00:22:48.923
That's so mean, Ruffian-chan.

00:22:49.403 --> 00:22:51.144
It's healthy, it's good for you.

00:22:51.184 --> 00:22:52.485
You're gonna scare the Ruffians!

00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:53.866
I wanna eat it, okay?

00:22:54.146 --> 00:22:54.947
Another attempt.

00:22:55.587 --> 00:22:56.688
You have to do it again.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:57.888
That was so bad.

00:22:57.908 --> 00:22:58.769
I have tears.

00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:00.990
That was so bad.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.332
Can I have tea?

00:23:04.692 --> 00:23:06.033
No tea, you gotta eat it.

00:23:06.053 --> 00:23:06.874
I want tea!

00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:16.659
I don't know if the issue was that I put it on the back of my tongue, but then it went to the front of my tongue and then I don't know which was worse.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.681
I got it in my mouth though.

00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:21.502
That's good, you got it in your mouth.

00:23:21.982 --> 00:23:23.343
Eat it with rice like a normal person.

00:23:23.423 --> 00:23:24.644
I don't eat it with rice.

00:23:25.264 --> 00:23:26.805
Natto soup is good too.

00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:27.946
I'm trying.

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:30.728
Moco-chan has to be as strong as me, so... I'm trying.

00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:31.569
I want to!

00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:32.429
I want to!

00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:33.330
Just do it again.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.491
No countdown this time.

00:23:35.151 --> 00:23:37.712
I feel like it's hurting my tummy.

00:23:38.372 --> 00:23:40.053
It's supposed to help my tummy.

00:23:40.073 --> 00:23:42.513
That's your emotions hurting your tummy, you know?

00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:44.274
I'll pick up another one.

00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:45.234
Another one?

00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:46.915
How about pick up three beans?

00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:48.355
No, it's so sticky.

00:23:48.435 --> 00:23:50.196
Yeah, because it's natto, you know?

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:51.657
It's so sticky.

00:23:51.697 --> 00:23:52.377
It's natto.

00:23:52.877 --> 00:23:54.417
I don't want any other stickiness.

00:23:54.758 --> 00:23:55.558
There, it's gone.

00:24:00.353 --> 00:24:01.013
Three!

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:01.593
Two!

00:24:01.653 --> 00:24:02.053
One!

00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:05.895
Wait, where should I put all my tongue?

00:24:06.335 --> 00:24:07.015
In your mouth.

00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:09.095
Should I chew it?

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:10.536
You should chew it.

00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:13.737
Yeah, that way the Ruffians can know how it truly tastes.

00:24:14.317 --> 00:24:15.577
Okay, I need you to hold this then.

00:24:15.677 --> 00:24:17.618
I need to have my tissue just in case.

00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:20.259
You don't trust me with the tissue anymore?

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:20.939
I don't know.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:21.399
Okay.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:24.460
Because when I chew it, it's going to get sticky in my mouth, right?

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.841
I don't know.

00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:27.821
The stickiness is just on the outside, I think.

00:24:28.682 --> 00:24:29.102
I don't know.

00:24:29.242 --> 00:24:30.102
It's like bean on the inside.

00:24:30.182 --> 00:24:32.963
Once the bean is in my mouth, then my mouth will be sticky too.

00:24:33.023 --> 00:24:33.543
It will be.

00:24:33.923 --> 00:24:34.324
Okay!

00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:35.404
Three!

00:24:35.784 --> 00:24:36.524
Okay, I'm going to do it.

00:24:36.564 --> 00:24:37.825
I'm going to do it.

00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:38.825
Two!

00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:39.125
One!

00:24:39.365 --> 00:24:39.885
In it goes!

00:24:40.466 --> 00:24:40.846
It's in there.

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:42.126
It's on the tip of the tongue.

00:24:45.007 --> 00:24:46.008
Moco-chan!

00:24:46.028 --> 00:24:48.330
Eat properly!

00:24:48.971 --> 00:24:50.071
It got on my lips!

00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:52.974
What happened to your food?

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:53.714
No, no!

00:24:53.774 --> 00:24:56.056
It was in my mouth but it was still on my lips!

00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:57.718
This is such a sad attempt.

00:24:57.738 --> 00:24:59.980
Can you even call this an attempt?

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.361
I want tea!

00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:02.181
No tea!

00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:04.103
Not until you eat the whole 50 grams!

00:25:04.123 --> 00:25:04.183
No!

00:25:04.243 --> 00:25:04.824
Okay, you eat it.

00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:05.284
I give up.

00:25:05.464 --> 00:25:06.945
We'll challenge this again, okay?

00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:08.206
Hey!

00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:08.707
Hey!

00:25:08.927 --> 00:25:09.087
Okay!

00:25:09.487 --> 00:25:10.608
This was a success.

00:25:10.648 --> 00:25:14.652
This was a successful challenge because it was in my mouth, okay?

00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:15.593
It was in your mouth?

00:25:15.713 --> 00:25:15.973
Yeah.

00:25:16.894 --> 00:25:20.898
Next time, I'll properly eat one piece, okay?

00:25:21.178 --> 00:25:22.219
One piece?

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:25.462
You gotta eat it all, Moco-chan.

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.403
It was successful.

00:25:26.423 --> 00:25:27.604
Can I have tea?

00:25:27.904 --> 00:25:28.104
No.

00:25:28.865 --> 00:25:30.767
Not until you're fully successful.

00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:35.143
Challenge failed.

00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:35.223
No!

00:25:35.243 --> 00:25:37.626
This was successful.

00:25:37.646 --> 00:25:38.908
This was successful.

00:25:38.928 --> 00:25:39.909
It was.

00:25:43.243 --> 00:25:48.927
Thank you, Tochigi Farmers, for making delicious natto that I will be enjoying very much.

00:25:48.967 --> 00:25:50.108
Yeah, it's not a waste.

00:25:50.368 --> 00:25:51.268
Just the two pieces.

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.269
BAU BAU!

00:25:52.309 --> 00:25:54.471
That was sad.

00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:55.331
That was sad.

00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:56.192
It wasn't.

00:25:56.612 --> 00:26:00.134
Welcome to our regular corner for today.

00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:04.257
Next, we have our Doggie of the Day!

00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:06.439
Which doggy is it today, Moco-chan?

00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:08.365
Den!

00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:12.187
It's Den!

00:26:12.247 --> 00:26:12.567
Ruffy!

00:26:12.607 --> 00:26:13.527
Ruffy, right!

00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:14.128
Den!

00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:15.588
Look at you!

00:26:15.988 --> 00:26:18.209
You too are fluffy!

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:21.030
So fluffy, you almost rival me!

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:21.611
Really?

00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:22.471
I think you're beat.

00:26:23.802 --> 00:26:24.023
What?

00:26:24.283 --> 00:26:24.603
No!

00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:28.146
I'm more fluffy than Ren, right?

00:26:28.166 --> 00:26:29.287
I think you're kidding yourself.

00:26:29.307 --> 00:26:30.328
Right, Ruffians?

00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:31.649
Right.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.232
But, you know, this is Ren right here.

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:37.254
Just as she's waking up from a nap on the sofa.

00:26:37.314 --> 00:26:38.415
Very cute.

00:26:38.495 --> 00:26:40.057
I like good naps.

00:26:40.077 --> 00:26:40.677
Right?

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:44.741
Just looking at this photo makes me want to curl up with her right there, right?

00:26:44.781 --> 00:26:45.061
Right!

00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:46.162
Good nap!

00:26:46.622 --> 00:26:47.423
All together!

00:26:47.483 --> 00:26:49.065
Right, the warm sunlight.

00:26:50.365 --> 00:26:58.832
Ben is a doggie made for taking midday naps with, you know?

00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:03.116
Silly, sleepy, smiley face.

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:05.338
How do you think she BAU BAUs?

00:27:05.358 --> 00:27:09.302
I think it'd be sort of soft, like a blanket.

00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:12.985
Oh, like a very well-mannered BAU BAU like me?

00:27:13.045 --> 00:27:13.886
Like a fluffy one?

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.128
Like, BAU BAU.

00:27:16.188 --> 00:27:16.368
Really?

00:27:16.408 --> 00:27:18.009
Like a... BAU BAU!

00:27:18.229 --> 00:27:18.430
No.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.950
No.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:19.871
BAU BAU.

00:27:20.411 --> 00:27:21.853
A bit, a bit warm sounding.

00:27:21.893 --> 00:27:22.853
Oh, a bit warm.

00:27:22.893 --> 00:27:23.154
Oh, indeed.

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:24.995
Yeah.

00:27:25.436 --> 00:27:35.644
Well, I think, you know, then... If you're trying to avoid taking warm, comfy naps in the sun, then... Then maybe it'll get a bit tricky for you, but...

00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:42.968
Also, with Ren being by your side, I think every day will be filled with really good times.

00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:46.170
I suggest falling asleep together in the sun.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.312
BAU BAU!

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:54.374
And next, let's see where our Ruffians went for a walk.

00:27:56.027 --> 00:27:59.690
De-den!

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.072
Look at those blue skies!

00:28:02.192 --> 00:28:02.932
So high up!

00:28:03.052 --> 00:28:04.794
And all the green too!

00:28:05.534 --> 00:28:07.316
It's beautiful!

00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:12.720
We're glad you took a moment out of your day to head over to the park maybe too!

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:19.085
Even if it's just like a close-by park, you can always... It changes your mood so much, you know?

00:28:19.425 --> 00:28:22.688
I wonder though, do you think they have like a swing set or something there?

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:28.789
I think that going on the swings while overlooking the scenery would be really, really fun.

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:31.390
Although sometimes the swings can be super scary, right?

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.190
It makes my tummy drop when I go too high.

00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:40.132
But you know, this is what good days are made of.

00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:44.432
It's hard not to be in a really good mood when the world around you is all like this, right?

00:28:44.612 --> 00:28:46.833
It feels like it looks sort of nostalgic.

00:28:48.635 --> 00:28:49.717
That's the feel I get.

00:28:49.857 --> 00:28:51.440
BAU BAU!

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.422
Thank you!

00:28:52.442 --> 00:28:56.509
And next, we have our Question of the Day.

00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:57.211
What do we have?

00:28:58.482 --> 00:28:58.602
Oh!

00:28:59.363 --> 00:29:04.968
You've played Zelda on an N64, and will play a couple of games on PS2.

00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:10.373
What consoles do FUWAMOCO have access to, and would you like to play on stream if possible?

00:29:10.873 --> 00:29:13.335
Any consoles or portables you wish you had?

00:29:14.997 --> 00:29:23.685
Our consoles, well, we worked really hard to save up for a lot of them, but either we have our SNES, you know that,

00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:26.170
Bored with, right?

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.910
But the one we have right now, I think?

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:28.691
I think?

00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:30.511
It's not the original one.

00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:32.172
It's the second in line.

00:29:32.252 --> 00:29:34.213
Yeah, the first one is still old.

00:29:34.453 --> 00:29:39.375
Yeah, the first one kind of didn't make it away, luckily, you know?

00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:40.055
But that's okay.

00:29:40.075 --> 00:29:41.596
We have a good second one now.

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:44.577
And our original N64 we still have.

00:29:44.877 --> 00:29:47.758
And we have a thick US PS2.

00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:49.299
Yeah, very thick.

00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:50.379
Chubby one.

00:29:50.639 --> 00:29:54.361
And then we have a thin white Japanese PS2 as well.

00:29:55.621 --> 00:29:59.322
We have a Wii somewhere.

00:29:59.342 --> 00:30:00.223
I don't know where that is.

00:30:00.323 --> 00:30:03.824
I guess Mama Puppy has a Wii U so maybe that kind of counts.

00:30:04.744 --> 00:30:05.104
Right?

00:30:05.204 --> 00:30:09.066
And then we also have a PS3 and a PS4.

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:13.147
Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy got that as part of a deal and then they just kind of...

00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:18.330
Gave that to us right before we went into the cell, so really we haven't used that.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.410
We're not very touched.

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:22.232
And then we have a slate!

00:30:22.252 --> 00:30:29.536
As for handhelds, I guess... We had a Game Boy Color, and DS Lite, and...

00:30:31.007 --> 00:30:35.691
Maybe you've heard of it, maybe not, but we had an Atari Lynx.

00:30:35.811 --> 00:30:37.192
Yeah!

00:30:37.272 --> 00:30:42.496
But it was kind of hard to play with, and it took a lot of batteries, it was really heavy.

00:30:42.556 --> 00:30:43.837
Really big, yeah.

00:30:43.937 --> 00:30:45.478
You need muscle for it.

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:48.261
You know, we didn't really understand the game that we had.

00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.443
I think it was something like Gauntlet?

00:30:51.803 --> 00:30:52.504
Only one game.

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:53.385
Yeah, so...

00:30:54.218 --> 00:30:55.419
We don't have it anymore.

00:30:56.739 --> 00:30:58.100
It was really, really big.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.561
But I think if we could have any console that we don't have.

00:31:03.742 --> 00:31:04.342
Console?

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:04.962
I don't know.

00:31:05.082 --> 00:31:09.264
Not really a console, but we'd really like to have a PC-98.

00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:09.464
PC-98.

00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:14.686
You know, if we could play PC-98 games together with Ruffians, that would be really fun.

00:31:15.287 --> 00:31:17.167
I don't think that's gonna happen ever.

00:31:17.187 --> 00:31:18.388
I don't even...

00:31:19.568 --> 00:31:28.711
I think in general we really do like games, but maybe we're not the greatest at them.

00:31:28.891 --> 00:31:30.051
We're not very good at them.

00:31:30.991 --> 00:31:32.232
But fun is fun!

00:31:32.372 --> 00:31:34.012
We have lots of respect and love.

00:31:38.133 --> 00:31:38.474
BAU BAU!

00:31:38.514 --> 00:31:38.954
Thank you!

00:31:38.974 --> 00:31:40.676
Thank you for the question!

00:31:58.414 --> 00:32:04.921
Ruffians, as you know, we're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, Doggie of the Day, your walks.

00:32:05.622 --> 00:32:07.804
Please, please keep on asking, okay?

00:32:08.084 --> 00:32:10.046
Keep on sending your stuff, okay?

00:32:10.126 --> 00:32:11.468
Asking the questions, you know?

00:32:12.168 --> 00:32:13.630
BAU BAU!

00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:18.275
And for our next team, Moco-chan, what do we have coming up here?

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:18.435
We have...

00:32:20.598 --> 00:32:24.220
Minecraft!

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.900
Revenge.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.801
Revenge is nothing scary.

00:32:29.302 --> 00:32:32.523
Last time, things didn't quite go as planned.

00:32:32.563 --> 00:32:36.485
There were a couple bumps that prevented us from doing what we set out to do.

00:32:36.885 --> 00:32:39.746
But this time, there won't be any issues, right?

00:32:40.507 --> 00:32:40.707
Right.

00:32:41.508 --> 00:32:41.769
Right!

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:49.664
We're gonna do lots of exploring with as much excitement, you know, just like the day we broke out of the cell, right?

00:32:50.285 --> 00:32:51.307
That much excitement.

00:32:51.347 --> 00:32:52.429
Where's Nerissa?

00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:54.052
I don't know.

00:32:55.219 --> 00:32:57.882
Yeah, let's take a look at what I said by the beginning.

00:32:58.022 --> 00:32:58.503
Okay.

00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:00.986
And hopefully we won't touch anything.

00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:04.530
Well, for Minecraft, it's revenge.

00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.174
But, I haven't forgotten.

00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:10.598
I forgot what?

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:12.200
Did you forget?

00:33:14.443 --> 00:33:15.424
I haven't forgotten.

00:33:15.444 --> 00:33:17.425
But you know what?

00:33:17.886 --> 00:33:20.768
I'm gonna wait until she forgets.

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:25.872
And then, when she's not expecting it.

00:33:26.973 --> 00:33:27.594
Someday.

00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:29.715
I'll make her pay.

00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:31.136
What do they say?

00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:34.319
Revenge is a dish best served cold?

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:35.880
What?

00:33:36.961 --> 00:33:37.381
Slow.

00:33:37.962 --> 00:33:38.282
Slow.

00:33:38.682 --> 00:33:39.663
Yeah.

00:33:39.723 --> 00:33:40.644
Slow and cold.

00:33:41.024 --> 00:33:41.164
Yeah.

00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:45.428
Let's take a look at our schedule too.

00:33:45.488 --> 00:33:47.129
It's a new schedule.

00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:47.969
Yeah!

00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:52.271
This week we're going to be playing a bunch of games and a bunch of new games too.

00:33:52.571 --> 00:33:54.772
We have the Cruising Shift.

00:33:54.792 --> 00:33:56.033
We're going to become baristas.

00:33:56.053 --> 00:33:56.173
Yeah!

00:33:56.413 --> 00:33:58.194
I want to do latte art.

00:33:58.454 --> 00:34:00.134
Before we could do like a heart.

00:34:00.234 --> 00:34:01.615
Here's your latte.

00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:03.717
I do it just for you!

00:34:03.797 --> 00:34:06.219
You just gonna drink it like that?

00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.320
You're not gonna take a photo?

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.622
What is wrong with you?

00:34:09.782 --> 00:34:14.446
We'll also be doing our best on the weekend because we're gonna be studying a bunch of kanji.

00:34:14.526 --> 00:34:17.209
Hopefully we're gonna be learning some new words.

00:34:17.229 --> 00:34:24.015
There's still a lot that we don't know so hopefully this can be kind of a first step towards passing our

00:34:24.575 --> 00:34:26.316
JLPT N1, you know?

00:34:26.596 --> 00:34:27.816
Good study session.

00:34:28.056 --> 00:34:29.677
It's gonna be really hard though.

00:34:30.037 --> 00:34:32.298
A lot of our senpai have been playing it.

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:38.180
It's not that easy, so... We're gonna do our best, but we're gonna learn a lot too, I think.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.920

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.301

00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:04.035
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:08.159
Oh, that was fast!

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.741
