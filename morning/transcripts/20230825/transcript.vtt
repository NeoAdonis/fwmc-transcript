04:37.492 --> 04:38.580
I mean...

04:39.215 --> 04:40.993
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

04:41.613 --> 04:44.293
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

04:44.313 --> 04:48.394
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

04:48.414 --> 04:51.455
Heather, how you doing?

04:59.076 --> 05:00.376
Did you forget about me?

05:01.056 --> 05:04.457
It's I, the Great Perroccino, aka Pero!

05:05.456 --> 05:08.999
And I'm here to take over today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:09.860 --> 05:10.861
Surprise see me?

05:12.622 --> 05:15.465
Thank you for joining for the 11th episode.

05:15.945 --> 05:16.306
I guess.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.932
You know, I'm tired.

05:24.113 --> 05:26.014
I'm tired of being an afterthought.

05:26.755 --> 05:32.300
So, I turned off FUWAMOCO's alarms and made sure they slept in past FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:34.494 --> 05:37.797
I figured you Ruffians would be happy to see me anyways, huh?

05:38.998 --> 05:41.780
And no one, I can tell.

05:44.742 --> 05:45.743
Who am I?

05:46.443 --> 05:48.144
I'm Perroccino the Great!

05:50.106 --> 05:52.067
You can't hide anything from me, okay?

05:53.409 --> 05:55.070
I can see you're all ecstatic.

06:02.156 --> 06:08.198
Maybe some of you Ruffians are a bit confused, but I need to cement my position as their mentor.

06:08.658 --> 06:12.479
Not just some silly forgotten furball and tailor joke, you know?

06:13.559 --> 06:14.700
I'm powerful!

06:15.500 --> 06:16.720
I need respect!

06:17.561 --> 06:20.321
So, today, I'm shaking things up.

06:20.922 --> 06:25.323
You better enjoy FUWAMOCO Morning without FUWAMOCO from now on, okay?

06:25.343 --> 06:27.784
Because I'm your host, Perroccino.

06:28.164 --> 06:28.644
Got it?

06:31.531 --> 06:32.131
Respect!

06:32.571 --> 06:33.652
Yes, respect!

06:34.632 --> 06:35.633
Perroccino!

06:37.814 --> 06:38.074
Okay.

06:39.034 --> 06:40.695
Here we go.

06:40.755 --> 06:41.755
What do I have to do here?

06:41.835 --> 06:42.555
Oh yeah, okay.

06:44.536 --> 06:53.520
Yeah, so yesterday, FUWAMOCO, they went to the back rooms to try to find me, right?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.381
They did a terrible, terrible job.

06:58.055 --> 07:02.517
Now, which one of you Ruffians told them I was there, huh?

07:03.637 --> 07:07.039
The Great Perroccino never stays in one spot too long.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.199
I can go wherever I please.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.980
I ain't no one's pet.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.842
Did you find it funny, dog?

07:16.282 --> 07:18.463
It did make for some good training for them, huh?

07:19.944 --> 07:20.724
It was you!

07:21.104 --> 07:24.926
It was you that said, maybe you need to go to the bathrooms too, huh?

07:27.312 --> 07:36.495
Well, as their mentor and their trainer, maybe it wasn't a bad idea for them to ruff it out, but... Do you think I should try to get them to overcome it?

07:37.815 --> 07:39.476
Should I go back to the back rooms?

07:40.696 --> 07:42.197
Tell them I'm still there, huh?

07:44.957 --> 07:45.838
Punish you?

07:46.958 --> 07:48.839
I'm not here to punish the Ruffians.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.000
Yeah?

07:55.061 --> 07:56.381
You think they need more training?

07:58.936 --> 08:00.157
Okay.

08:00.257 --> 08:03.178
Let's make sure they get well-trained, okay Ruffians?

08:06.800 --> 08:07.820
Better be careful though.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.542
Because if you're not careful, I'll send you to the back rooms, okay?

08:12.162 --> 08:12.842
Respect!

08:16.384 --> 08:16.964
Next up.

08:17.824 --> 08:19.645
It's something very important to me.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.106
The Great Perroccino.

08:23.387 --> 08:23.767
Next!

08:24.948 --> 08:27.709
We have... Holosummer.

08:29.099 --> 08:31.081
Ruffians, you know a howl of summer, right?

08:33.183 --> 08:34.104
Howl of summer.

08:35.065 --> 08:37.268
Have you been enjoying it as much as I have?

08:37.909 --> 08:45.577
Yeah, I've been enjoying it.

08:49.127 --> 08:50.767
Bathing suit girl of yours.

08:51.668 --> 08:52.548
Dancing.

08:53.288 --> 08:54.048
Singing.

08:54.948 --> 08:55.729
Jumping.

09:01.050 --> 09:09.872
And the climax of it all is this weekend with hololive Summer 2023 3D Live Splash Party!

09:10.952 --> 09:12.313
You got your tickets right.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.273
Right!

09:16.494 --> 09:17.954
It's my swimsuit!

09:19.625 --> 09:20.586
I'm already wearing it.

09:24.088 --> 09:31.091
Well, FUWAMOCO and the Abyssgardios will be doing a watch-along for both days this weekend, you know it!

09:31.632 --> 09:35.574
At ungodly hours, which makes it even more fun!

09:36.975 --> 09:42.258
Ruffians, you're looking forward to the sunshine performance or the night performance?

09:42.318 --> 09:42.858
Which one?

09:44.059 --> 09:46.080
There's sunshine and night.

09:48.012 --> 09:48.792
You know me.

09:49.252 --> 09:50.193
Perroccino.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.073
I'm looking towards night.

09:53.613 --> 09:54.494
Paws down.

09:54.514 --> 09:54.594
Yeah.

09:55.534 --> 09:57.474
You know what?

09:57.974 --> 10:00.395
I wanted to join Advent for the watchalong.

10:00.755 --> 10:01.315
And you know what?

10:01.875 --> 10:02.595
I asked.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.476
But management wouldn't let me.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.357
Can you believe it?

10:10.157 --> 10:10.937
I wonder why.

10:10.957 --> 10:13.398
The nerve of them whore!

10:15.378 --> 10:17.239
I guess I'll just have to

10:18.729 --> 10:19.310
Savor it.

10:20.090 --> 10:20.510
Later.

10:21.251 --> 10:22.192
At my own leisure.

10:26.715 --> 10:29.477
But make sure you join the avid girlios, okay?

10:31.919 --> 10:33.000
I'm not squishy!

10:33.781 --> 10:34.301
Got it?

10:38.625 --> 10:46.691
Now, you might have a couple questions about just who exactly I am, because I'm a bit mysterious, huh?

10:48.513 --> 10:53.875
Just FUWAMOCO to me, right?

10:55.576 --> 10:57.957
Well, I have a bit of a treat for you today.

10:59.898 --> 11:03.319
First up, I have Fuwawa here.

11:05.180 --> 11:10.782
Now, you might have heard a bit from them, but I'm not their pet.

11:11.082 --> 11:12.143
Don't misunderstand.

11:13.203 --> 11:17.385
I'm their mentor, their trainer, their master!

11:20.308 --> 11:20.709
Jealous.

11:22.791 --> 11:26.054
I've known the two of them since they were just little pupperonis.

11:26.915 --> 11:32.501
They've maybe gotten a bit stronger since then, but they still have a far way to go.

11:32.521 --> 11:35.044
Especially after yesterday.

11:35.124 --> 11:35.784
Don't got it.

11:36.866 --> 11:37.907
Now, Fuwawa.

11:37.987 --> 11:39.248
Yeah, back to Fuwawa.

11:39.808 --> 11:41.969
She's very fluffy.

11:45.332 --> 11:46.172
Fluffy, yeah.

11:46.712 --> 11:48.033
She's the older sister.

11:48.794 --> 11:51.956
I wish she let me warm up to her a bit more, you know it!

11:52.876 --> 11:53.717
You got me!

11:54.157 --> 11:55.318
Understand me!

11:56.319 --> 11:58.060
But, she doesn't like me.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.681
She thinks I'm just nasty.

11:59.701 --> 12:04.264
She says I should learn more manners.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.932
Demon Dogs, we don't need no manners.

12:08.252 --> 12:09.813
We just need respect.

12:11.975 --> 12:17.198
At the very least though, she usually gives me the better leftovers for food compared to Mococo.

12:18.559 --> 12:22.162
Mococos, they're always sorta half-chewed up.

12:22.882 --> 12:23.763
Not the best.

12:26.825 --> 12:28.987
Now, on to Mococo.

12:30.888 --> 12:31.468
Mococo!

12:32.956 --> 12:35.058
As the runt, she gets me a bit more.

12:35.198 --> 12:36.679
That's not that I'm the runt.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.983
I am the strong master, but she gets me a bit more, you know?

12:41.543 --> 12:43.085
She likes to have fun.

12:44.146 --> 12:50.131
So if I have some sort of scheme, as long as I convince her that it'll be fun, she'll listen.

12:50.331 --> 12:51.832
She'll go along with it, you know?

12:51.852 --> 12:53.874
It's pretty great sometimes.

12:54.795 --> 12:57.497
But she's not like her older sister at all, no.

12:58.217 --> 12:59.078
Not fluffy.

13:00.159 --> 13:01.020
Only fuzzy.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.091
I gotta be honest.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.612
I prefer the fluffy type, you know?

13:06.632 --> 13:08.613
More to cuddle up to.

13:11.255 --> 13:11.675
Yeah.

13:12.636 --> 13:13.076
Yeah.

13:14.577 --> 13:15.738
How do you feel about it?

13:17.519 --> 13:18.219
Be honest.

13:18.779 --> 13:19.260
Go on.

13:21.841 --> 13:22.362
Pet?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.363
You can't pet me.

13:24.763 --> 13:25.844
I'm the Great Perroccino.

13:30.271 --> 13:30.811
Same.

13:31.732 --> 13:32.252
Got me.

13:32.913 --> 13:37.856
Maybe the Ruffians, maybe you and I are a bit closer than you thought, huh?

13:40.997 --> 13:50.063
But you know, Fuwawa and Mococo, together, I think they have the potential to be pretty strong.

13:51.664 --> 13:56.086
But they get so scared so easily.

13:56.106 --> 13:58.588
You know, even by their own shadows.

13:59.864 --> 14:00.905
Just embarrassing.

14:04.047 --> 14:07.289
So, I have a lot of training I need to get them to do.

14:08.729 --> 14:13.632
But, I guess, for you Ruffians, I have to give you a bit of credit.

14:13.652 --> 14:18.295
I have to say, thank you for giving them a job for now.

14:19.256 --> 14:25.580
I guess, protecting your smiles is something, but it's nothing compared to protecting the gates to the Makai.

14:26.644 --> 14:33.747
Gotta whip them into shape so that one day they can make us all proud and protect the gates of the Makai, okay?

14:35.228 --> 14:36.889
Your smile is just a placeholder.

14:38.189 --> 14:38.650
Got it.

14:38.670 --> 14:46.413
I don't love them.

14:48.174 --> 14:49.955
I'm just here to train them, okay?

14:50.775 --> 14:51.796
They gotta be tough.

14:53.746 --> 14:55.907
Oh, and that's right.

14:56.908 --> 14:57.869
I heard some things.

15:00.350 --> 15:04.633
I heard a few things about what you lot have been saying about me.

15:04.653 --> 15:11.097
That you want to replace me?

15:11.117 --> 15:11.158
Ha!

15:11.178 --> 15:11.218
Ha!

15:15.751 --> 15:17.691
You think you can just take my place?

15:18.231 --> 15:19.072
A human?

15:20.032 --> 15:21.412
I'm a Demon Dog.

15:22.432 --> 15:25.473
I've given them the best training you can receive.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.873
The best training in the whole Makai.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.674
And you just wanna switch?

15:30.934 --> 15:32.574
You wanna replace me?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.995
You're gonna have to be strong.

15:38.255 --> 15:40.975
And then, you're gonna have to fight me.

15:42.796 --> 15:43.756
You ready for that?

15:45.666 --> 15:46.506
I don't think so.

15:49.688 --> 15:56.031
You may speak big words, Ruffians, but I'm all muscle.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.834
Think before you speak.

16:02.014 --> 16:03.335
Respect, okay?

16:05.196 --> 16:13.820
Now, I also heard that FUWAMOCO, they shared my x-rays with you, so I'll just show you once again here.

16:14.557 --> 16:15.417
My x-rays.

16:17.178 --> 16:24.821
No, I may only have two bones in my body, but like I said, the rest is pure muscle.

16:27.662 --> 16:33.585
No matter how fluffy or fuzzy or squishy or wiggly I look, it's all muscle.

16:35.445 --> 16:37.366
So, I'll ask you again.

16:37.386 --> 16:41.228
Do you really think you can handle me, huh?

16:45.106 --> 16:46.047
I don't think you can.

16:46.067 --> 16:48.709
Uh-uh.

16:49.570 --> 16:50.050
Uh-uh.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.054
Plus, I'm an old dog.

16:55.794 --> 17:03.360
I may not have new tricks, but I have some surprises up my paws that will put you in your place!

17:04.721 --> 17:06.423
You wouldn't want to deal with that, huh?

17:09.085 --> 17:10.146
I'm not squishy!

17:14.813 --> 17:16.394
You better hold your mouth.

17:21.198 --> 17:25.501
You know, I can just imagine your faces now, Ruffians.

17:26.142 --> 17:28.203
Your face all beat up.

17:33.447 --> 17:34.808
You better watch out.

17:34.828 --> 17:39.072
Because without respect, you're done for.

17:39.852 --> 17:43.255
You could never replace me, the Great Perroccino.

17:45.390 --> 17:48.652
Get some more muscle before you come and attack me, huh?

17:54.055 --> 17:54.295
Now.

17:56.116 --> 17:59.018
I do have some more important stuff to talk about here.

18:00.539 --> 18:05.181
That probably FUWAMOCO would want me to talk about, okay?

18:05.902 --> 18:06.602
So first!

18:08.083 --> 18:11.565
We have the FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

18:12.565 --> 18:14.987
Now, I think I talked about it a bit last time.

18:16.223 --> 18:19.065
But... They asked you, right?

18:19.385 --> 18:20.846
They asked you, Ruffians!

18:21.427 --> 18:25.730
Try your luck at making a jingle to start off FUWAMOCO Morning with, right?

18:26.591 --> 18:27.591
You remember, right?

18:29.032 --> 18:29.353
Yeah.

18:29.953 --> 18:30.233
Yeah.

18:31.374 --> 18:35.637
Have you been listening to some of the entries the Ruffians posted on Twitter?

18:35.657 --> 18:38.379
Yeah?

18:39.840 --> 18:41.762
Yeah, some of them are pretty cool, huh?

18:42.242 --> 18:43.243
Pretty jazzy.

18:44.295 --> 18:46.796
Pretty Pero-esque, right?

18:47.616 --> 18:47.956
Yeah.

18:49.237 --> 18:49.997
But you know what?

18:51.137 --> 18:55.359
The most important thing is... I don't know if some of you got it!

18:55.379 --> 19:01.781
You know... We don't want your jingle if you're not a Ruffian.

19:02.898 --> 19:07.842
This is something for you Ruffians to do to get closer with FUWAMOCO and vice versa.

19:08.382 --> 19:10.004
It's about passion.

19:10.844 --> 19:15.728
So, don't worry if you've never made something or don't have a musical bone in your booty.

19:18.951 --> 19:20.712
A musical bone in your body!

19:23.074 --> 19:25.536
It's about trying something new, you know it!

19:26.697 --> 19:27.578
Now, remember.

19:29.724 --> 19:34.106
The submission deadline is September 3rd, okay?

19:36.267 --> 19:36.788
Got it!

19:39.769 --> 19:42.591
Make sure to use the hashtag FUWAMOCOJINGLE.

19:43.271 --> 19:44.912
All the rules are right up there, you see?

19:45.312 --> 19:48.354
So, make sure you take a look and go over on Twitter.

19:49.194 --> 19:51.776
Now, remember the most important thing.

19:52.596 --> 19:54.977
You have to be a Ruffian to enter.

19:55.638 --> 19:56.078
Got it?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.179
Got it, Ruffrians?

20:00.154 --> 20:01.075
Yeah, okay.

20:03.737 --> 20:04.098
I see.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.260
You're very understanding people.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.120
I get it.

20:07.441 --> 20:08.121
I like that.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.525
Okay, next thing we have here.

20:12.385 --> 20:12.846
What was it?

20:17.790 --> 20:18.651
Oh yeah, okay.

20:19.932 --> 20:22.795
They have this important thing this weekend, you might have heard of it!

20:22.815 --> 20:25.598
FUWAMOCO, yeah.

20:26.818 --> 20:32.582
They're hosting a very special 500,000 Ruffians celebration this weekend.

20:32.902 --> 20:34.043
But not only that!

20:34.963 --> 20:37.905
They also have their memberships opening up.

20:38.506 --> 20:38.806
Yeah.

20:39.106 --> 20:40.367
You excited, Ruffians?

20:40.747 --> 20:41.088
Yeah?

20:42.048 --> 20:42.408
Yeah?

20:43.449 --> 20:44.089
Excited?

20:44.110 --> 20:46.631
Excited for members content?

20:49.127 --> 20:51.608
What sort of special stuff should they do, huh?

20:52.008 --> 20:54.269
Any sort of special training you think they should do?

20:55.010 --> 20:55.790
Huh, Ruffians?

20:55.810 --> 21:01.572
Huh?

21:02.072 --> 21:03.093
Am I a member?

21:03.173 --> 21:04.533
Why would I have to member?

21:04.954 --> 21:06.654
I'm the Great Pero, got it?

21:08.175 --> 21:12.617
Of course you'll be there to sign up and spend this important day with them, right?

21:12.817 --> 21:13.657
Right, Ruffians?

21:16.502 --> 21:22.628
I'm sure they'll have lots to talk to you about, along with the crazy karaoke stream later that day, huh?

21:23.489 --> 21:26.412
Now it's unarchived, so you have to be there, okay?

21:28.113 --> 21:32.177
No matter what they do, they always have your smiles in mind, Ruffians.

21:33.238 --> 21:35.921
You guys, you're the lucky ones, huh?

21:37.703 --> 21:37.843
Now...

21:39.653 --> 21:46.397
Before we get back to the normal FUWAMOCO Morning stuff, I have one thing I wanted to talk about.

21:50.659 --> 21:58.323
Now, I know that FUWAMOCO, sometimes they have these silly things called dreams that they see while they sleep.

21:58.883 --> 22:04.206
I don't know, I've never really had one, but I do have one dream in particular.

22:06.828 --> 22:07.228
One day,

22:08.906 --> 22:14.068
I want to eat something called PUDDING!

22:15.588 --> 22:16.848
Now you see this here.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.049
It's very very flubby.

22:20.429 --> 22:21.170
Very yellow.

22:22.270 --> 22:23.430
It looks pretty good.

22:24.030 --> 22:25.431
It smells pretty nice.

22:26.651 --> 22:29.132
But I only get the leftovers, right?

22:29.792 --> 22:35.494
And whenever FUWAMOCO gets PUDDING, do you think they have leftovers for me?

22:35.514 --> 22:35.634
Nuh-uh.

22:37.702 --> 22:38.723
No leftovers.

22:39.264 --> 22:39.985
Of course not.

22:41.146 --> 22:44.971
Now, I go and I buy my own food.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.813
But I have no hands.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.179
So, I need to rely on these silly pooches, huh?

22:53.129 --> 22:55.070
I can imagine this Purin.

22:55.811 --> 22:57.372
It's so sweet.

22:57.752 --> 22:58.813
So soft.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.434
But, you know, a bit mature.

23:01.934 --> 23:02.775
A bit bitter.

23:03.596 --> 23:05.337
Very, very Pero-esque.

23:05.797 --> 23:12.621
Very appropriate for a demon dog of my stature, of my level of respect.

23:14.702 --> 23:16.323
What do you think, Ruffians?

23:17.984 --> 23:18.945
It's just like me.

23:19.585 --> 23:20.866
It's very appropriate.

23:21.647 --> 23:21.867
Yeah.

23:22.543 --> 23:23.384
That's what I thought.

23:24.144 --> 23:28.828
So, until I can have some pudding, I cannot rest.

23:30.189 --> 23:32.551
You know, I just wanna suck it up in one big bite!

23:34.052 --> 23:34.792
Have you had it?

23:35.833 --> 23:36.434
Ruffians?

23:39.216 --> 23:44.140
I am 100% Russell, but if I eat something, it turns to Russell.

23:46.702 --> 23:49.464
I hope that my dreams can come true one day too.

23:49.484 --> 23:50.665
Yeah.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.407
Let's work hard for our dreams, okay Ruffians?

23:58.730 --> 24:06.315
Now, I guess there's these silly little corners that FUWAMOCO like to do.

24:06.716 --> 24:10.759
So, I guess I better do them too, right Ruffians?

24:14.161 --> 24:17.384
So the first one we have here is the Doggie of the Day.

24:18.346 --> 24:22.307
And the Doggie of the Day for today is... is this one.

24:23.627 --> 24:23.907
Yeah.

24:24.687 --> 24:27.688
This here... This here is Yui!

24:28.468 --> 24:30.189
Now look at Yui's rolls!

24:31.189 --> 24:33.249
This is quite the fluffy puffer.

24:33.729 --> 24:38.110
If I do say myself, nothing like me, but pretty good.

24:41.711 --> 24:43.671
It'd be nice to get a bit closer, huh?

24:44.392 --> 24:45.732
Enjoy some of the rolls!

24:47.159 --> 24:51.060
And if she gets a treat, if she gets on the show today, huh?

24:52.440 --> 24:53.240
What about me?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.000
Do I get a treat?

24:57.161 --> 24:58.381
A big treat for Pero?

24:58.401 --> 25:02.182
That's what I thought.

25:02.522 --> 25:05.662
I think I should get one, but... No!

25:06.342 --> 25:07.062
No!

25:09.543 --> 25:10.743
I'm not on a diet!

25:14.244 --> 25:15.664
I don't know what you're thinking.

25:17.759 --> 25:20.120
Ruffians, I expected better.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.361
I should get a treat too.

25:23.562 --> 25:28.324
Yui is definitely getting a treat, but I should not be excluded.

25:29.684 --> 25:30.204
Unfair.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.027
I guess that's all for the Doggie of the Day.

25:37.728 --> 25:38.168
Good luck.

25:38.708 --> 25:39.488
Good luck, Yui.

25:41.389 --> 25:43.530
Now for the Today I Went On A Walk.

25:45.111 --> 25:45.431
Is this.

25:48.200 --> 25:48.900
Very pink.

25:50.521 --> 25:51.781
Oh, it's a fair.

25:51.801 --> 25:56.663
Ah, it's those places with the yummy treats and the rides and fluffin', right?

25:57.243 --> 25:57.783
Yeah.

25:58.844 --> 26:01.865
That looks pretty fun right there, yeah?

26:03.065 --> 26:07.407
I always wanted to try to eat those candy apple things, right?

26:07.987 --> 26:08.827
But you know what?

26:10.448 --> 26:11.128
Mococon.

26:11.588 --> 26:17.290
She says that if I have a candy apple, I won't be able to fly anymore if I do, you know?

26:19.565 --> 26:20.205
What do you think?

26:21.286 --> 26:23.948
Should I show her that she's wrong one day?

26:23.968 --> 26:31.794
I can't fly.

26:31.854 --> 26:32.835
What do you think I'm doing?

26:32.915 --> 26:33.675
I'm flying!

26:33.695 --> 26:38.179
Do you think I just sat here?

26:39.319 --> 26:40.300
No, I fly.

26:41.381 --> 26:46.024
And you know, at the fair they also have those shooting games where you can win prizes to a high.

26:48.840 --> 26:59.906
It looks pretty fun, but I'm a bit worried I could get shot at if you give Fuwawa the gun, so maybe just leave the shooting to others.

27:00.666 --> 27:02.507
I won't recommend Mococo either.

27:02.527 --> 27:04.228
Yeah.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.069
I hope you have fun.

27:06.649 --> 27:08.670
Have one of the candy apples for me.

27:08.690 --> 27:13.473
It's not on my dime, but I would like you to have a candy apple.

27:13.493 --> 27:17.115
I'm happy you have fun.

27:18.911 --> 27:20.953
Now for the Question of the Day.

27:21.914 --> 27:22.735
Question of the Day.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.656
What do we have here?

27:26.098 --> 27:27.359
Okay, Question of the Day.

27:27.940 --> 27:36.208
First of all, this is for FUWAMOCO, so I can't answer for them, but I'll do my best to answer.

27:36.228 --> 27:40.913
Okay, so I'm gonna read this, but it's for FUWAMOCO.

27:40.953 --> 27:42.434
Don't misunderstand, okay?

27:44.076 --> 27:48.958
First of all, belated congratulations on your debut and 500k subscribers.

27:49.938 --> 27:59.402
My question is, you always talk about protecting our smiles, but how do we, Ruffians, protect your smiles?

28:00.943 --> 28:02.904
This is a question.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.365
I don't know if it's good, but it's a question.

28:07.166 --> 28:07.746
First of all,

28:08.925 --> 28:11.526
Does FUWAMOCO even need congratulating?

28:12.047 --> 28:13.728
They're fluff-ups, you know it!

28:14.468 --> 28:18.871
They still have lots to learn, so don't let it go to their heads, okay?

28:20.151 --> 28:27.055
As for you Ruffians, for protecting their smiles, why would you want to do that?

28:27.075 --> 28:35.960
They need to train to become better Demon Guard Dogs because, you know, right now, they're not doing so hot.

28:37.321 --> 28:37.681
Yeah.

28:38.922 --> 28:40.943
They're not very hot dogs!

28:42.303 --> 28:46.065
So, just let them do their own tasks for now, okay?

28:46.145 --> 28:46.545
Yeah?

28:48.346 --> 28:48.726
Chill?

28:49.326 --> 28:51.047
I'm always chill, got it?

28:53.068 --> 28:54.408
Yeah, they're just fluff bugs.

28:57.309 --> 29:04.092
Now, for protecting your smile, and that sort of fluff, yeah, bad thing, yeah.

29:05.523 --> 29:09.426
So the best thing you could do is to make others smile.

29:10.206 --> 29:23.296
You know, Fuwawa, Fuwawa, she would probably say something like, Make sure to say please and thank you to greet the people with energetic hello and make those around you nice.

29:23.756 --> 29:25.478
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

29:26.786 --> 29:31.871
But I'd appreciate it if you could get them to do more of their guard dog training.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.593
Don't worry about them.

29:33.713 --> 29:35.434
Just training, okay?

29:35.955 --> 29:37.356
They have a lot to learn.

29:39.919 --> 29:42.461
There's your question is now answered.

29:43.062 --> 29:43.762
You're welcome.

29:46.425 --> 29:50.229
Now, I think I've covered all these silly corners now, huh?

29:51.874 --> 29:55.797
Why would FUWAMOCO ever want to include you, Ruffians?

29:56.477 --> 29:57.197
I don't get it.

29:57.818 --> 29:58.979
I'll never understand.

29:59.639 --> 30:08.425
You know, spending a bit more time with you today, I think you're just a boring and smelly lot.

30:10.106 --> 30:15.429
Why they're so nice to you, but so rough to me, I don't get it.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.732
But I guess this is just how things are, huh?

30:22.256 --> 30:23.957
So, for their next dream!

30:25.337 --> 30:26.638
Their next dream is this.

30:27.838 --> 30:29.319
It's Phasmophobia.

30:30.219 --> 30:34.861
I think they're going to be going ghost hunting with all the avagurlios, huh?

30:36.081 --> 30:37.382
More intense training!

30:38.722 --> 30:46.005
Now, Ruffians, you all know that it wasn't that good in the bathrooms the other day, huh?

30:49.847 --> 30:50.887
That was all your fault.

30:52.771 --> 30:57.755
Now you better lend them a very strong paw so they actually learn something.

30:58.096 --> 31:02.079
And don't just cower in fear and depend on your avid members, okay?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.902
Make sure you push them a bit, okay?

31:06.563 --> 31:07.784
Yes, it's your fault.

31:08.304 --> 31:08.664
Yes.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.367
It's their fault, but it's also your fault.

31:11.387 --> 31:12.988
You need to push them a bit more.

31:13.568 --> 31:14.009
Got it?

31:16.841 --> 31:25.151
And for the next stuff, like I said, there's the Splash Party, but there's also the Celebration!

31:26.232 --> 31:28.034
Okay, you can't miss it!

31:28.114 --> 31:32.319
The 500,000 Ruffians Celebration on YouTube!

31:33.260 --> 31:38.624
And you know, they'll be singing some American wild songs too.

31:39.204 --> 31:41.026
You know, Papa Puppy!

31:41.446 --> 31:46.930
Papa Puppy and I, we go back quite a while.

31:47.671 --> 31:53.375
So I wonder if they'll be howling any of those songs that we used to party together with.

31:55.788 --> 31:56.788
Yeah, party!

31:57.849 --> 31:59.190
I remember those times.

31:59.910 --> 32:02.591
It'll be interesting, that's for sure.

32:04.752 --> 32:05.172
Got it.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.073
You're gonna be there for them, right?

32:07.393 --> 32:10.034
Cause they're just there to protect your smile.

32:10.415 --> 32:12.556
But you need new Ruffians.

32:12.596 --> 32:15.197
You need to make sure to train them properly, okay?

32:16.317 --> 32:17.558
I'm gonna be off a bit.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.519
So I'm depending on you, okay?

32:21.840 --> 32:22.280
Got it?

32:27.526 --> 32:30.107
Now, I have to give you credit.

32:31.207 --> 32:39.369
Thank you for joining me for the last episode of FUWAMOCO Morning for this week.

32:39.389 --> 32:45.591
I guess this is a bit embarrassing, but I should probably do this too, huh?

32:47.951 --> 32:49.231
Would you like it?

32:50.672 --> 32:53.973
Now don't be too happy if I read out your name or anything, okay?

32:54.713 --> 32:55.033
Okay?

32:57.580 --> 32:57.900
You.

32:59.821 --> 33:00.661
Good job today.

33:02.262 --> 33:02.762
The Lamb.

33:03.362 --> 33:03.702
Hi.

33:04.683 --> 33:05.583
I see you.

33:07.364 --> 33:07.944
Marcy.

33:09.385 --> 33:10.105
Have a good day.

33:11.906 --> 33:12.646
Next car.

33:13.586 --> 33:14.087
You too.

33:14.647 --> 33:15.367
Take easy.

33:16.368 --> 33:16.848
Fino?

33:17.428 --> 33:18.408
That's a pretty good name.

33:18.468 --> 33:19.789
It's sort of similar to Pero.

33:20.409 --> 33:21.209
Have a good day.

33:22.390 --> 33:22.770
Ria.

33:23.270 --> 33:23.690
You too.

33:24.151 --> 33:24.791
Take easy.

33:26.323 --> 33:30.906
And to every other Ruffian out there, have a good day.

33:31.447 --> 33:34.128
Maybe not a howl of a day, but a good day.

33:35.049 --> 33:38.411
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:39.272 --> 33:39.872
With Pero.

33:42.514 --> 33:43.955
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

33:44.675 --> 33:45.756
Later, Ruffians!

33:46.217 --> 33:46.657
Later.
