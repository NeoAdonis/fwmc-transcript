05:10.100 --> 05:12.550
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:12.921 --> 05:16.264
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.284 --> 05:20.266
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:20.326 --> 05:22.428
BAU BAU!

05:23.108 --> 05:29.212
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:29.232 --> 05:33.695
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:33.755 --> 05:34.236
BAU BAU!

05:45.847 --> 05:47.087
Are you unsure today?

05:47.107 --> 05:47.147
No!

05:47.588 --> 05:54.391
Not like it's our FUWAMOCO birthday today, right?

05:54.732 --> 05:57.033
BAU BAU!

05:57.693 --> 06:00.955
And today, it's our birthday!

06:01.595 --> 06:04.457
And we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:04.537 --> 06:05.537
BAU BAU!

06:06.578 --> 06:08.999
BAU BAU!

06:09.019 --> 06:11.700
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:12.261 --> 06:20.485
Thank you for joining us today for our 76th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning and on our birthday!

06:20.905 --> 06:21.485
BAU BAU!

06:24.047 --> 06:27.869
To be exact, Moco-chan, your birthday, right?

06:27.889 --> 06:29.370
My birthday.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.491
Your birthday.

06:30.951 --> 06:34.354
Happy birthday, Moco-chan.

06:34.614 --> 06:35.514
Thank you!

06:35.534 --> 06:41.539
It's an extra special episode of FUWAMOCO Morning today.

06:42.439 --> 06:44.120
But, Ruffians!

06:44.160 --> 06:48.362
There might be a couple of Ruffians who've stumbled in today, you know what I mean?

06:48.602 --> 06:52.403
Oh, it's a little bit of a extra special FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:53.044 --> 06:53.764
Wow.

06:54.144 --> 06:56.645
It's not every day, it's our birthday.

06:56.705 --> 06:57.166
BAU!

06:57.206 --> 06:57.806
It's just once a year.

06:59.494 --> 07:06.116
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:06.336 --> 07:07.896
AKA FUWAMOCO!

07:08.376 --> 07:10.937
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

07:11.717 --> 07:17.939
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:18.279 --> 07:22.240
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.421
FWMC Morning!

07:24.582 --> 07:28.685
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:28.705 --> 07:31.146
BAU BAU!

07:32.367 --> 07:33.288
Ruffians!

07:33.348 --> 07:36.390
You don't need to celebrate the hashtag, hashtag.

07:36.751 --> 07:41.494
It's not what you're supposed to be celebrating today.

07:41.514 --> 07:41.554
No!

07:41.894 --> 07:44.676
What are they supposed to be celebrating, huh, Moco-chan?

07:45.057 --> 07:50.641
Why are all these streamers and the balloons and presents?

07:52.716 --> 07:55.077
BAU BAU!

07:55.137 --> 07:58.599
Thank you, Ruffians!

07:59.039 --> 08:01.880
It's an extra, extra special day today.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.640
I wonder what it could be hard.

08:04.861 --> 08:05.601
Just a thought.

08:06.722 --> 08:14.004
Isn't it so wonderful to get to wake up and spend a birthday morning together with the Ruffians?

08:14.024 --> 08:14.685
BAU BAU.

08:14.765 --> 08:17.365
No words can get better than BAU.

08:17.826 --> 08:18.246
Wow.

08:20.047 --> 08:24.150
Well... It's about to get worse, Ruffians.

08:25.030 --> 08:30.975
Because... There's been... Another Pero Sighting.

08:31.815 --> 08:39.641
On our birthday... We already had Pero leave us that nasty birthday message, right?

08:43.043 --> 08:43.563
What now?

08:43.684 --> 08:44.184
Well...

08:46.647 --> 08:54.852
Let's see what the Ruffians saw, huh?

08:55.092 --> 08:56.313
What's this?

08:57.013 --> 09:03.897
A birthday party for... Pero?

09:04.238 --> 09:05.839
You did all this for him?

09:08.920 --> 09:13.403
That's nice that you prepared this wonderful birthday party for him.

09:13.663 --> 09:14.364
All for him!

09:14.384 --> 09:15.825
Fine.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.883
All the pink decorations!

09:20.324 --> 09:21.084
And you know it!

09:21.104 --> 09:24.445
It being my birthday today too!

09:25.205 --> 09:31.626
No, I definitely didn't think that maybe this was prepared for my birthday.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.567
It's all for Pero's birthday, huh?

09:37.788 --> 09:37.968
Now...

09:38.752 --> 09:41.614
Pero's deciding to take over my birthday too.

09:42.475 --> 09:44.816
No, I already had to share it with Fuwawa.

09:44.836 --> 09:52.061
And now finally when I get to celebrate my birthday, just my own birthday this year, with the Ruffians now.

09:56.584 --> 09:56.945
No.

09:58.406 --> 10:00.447
Pero is truly nasty.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.881
Don't worry, Moco-chan.

10:08.222 --> 10:11.124
It'll be a wonderful birthday for you today.

10:12.245 --> 10:19.712
It's really nice that you decided to organize this big birthday party all for Pero.

10:19.992 --> 10:21.273
I guess it's a nice effort.

10:21.453 --> 10:21.673
Right?

10:21.934 --> 10:22.954
Look at Pero!

10:22.974 --> 10:23.975
Do you see?

10:23.995 --> 10:26.197
I guess he's so happy.

10:26.297 --> 10:27.939
I should be happy for him.

10:30.180 --> 10:34.242
Just don't forget that it's my birthday too, okay?

10:34.322 --> 10:35.822
What is Pero's birthday?

10:36.923 --> 10:37.843
He's too nasty.

10:37.863 --> 10:39.244
He doesn't get a birthday.

10:39.964 --> 10:43.405
Well, then... I guess I'm happy for him.

10:43.465 --> 10:49.407
If he doesn't get a birthday ever, then... I guess I'm happy.

10:51.868 --> 10:55.770
Let's all make sure that we celebrate Moco-chan's birthday today.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.491
And, uh... Well, Pero, you know...

10:59.747 --> 11:02.089
Maybe he can come a little later.

11:03.109 --> 11:03.550
Right?

11:05.371 --> 11:05.791
Maybe.

11:05.811 --> 11:09.354
BAU BAU!

11:09.434 --> 11:11.555
He does look really happy though.

11:12.276 --> 11:12.796
Right?

11:12.876 --> 11:17.580
You can just feel the happiness radiating from his lumpy body.

11:18.783 --> 11:22.584
I just... BAU BAU!

11:22.605 --> 11:25.446
Ruffians!

11:26.206 --> 11:36.910
I want to say thank you so much for celebrating my birthday yesterday!

11:36.930 --> 11:42.252
Yesterday, my 48 hours FUWAMOCO birthday officially started.

11:42.272 --> 11:47.134
As you know, we counted down the very first moments to it all together.

11:49.109 --> 11:53.134
In the evening yesterday, it was my birthday party!

11:53.174 --> 11:53.574
Yeah!

11:53.614 --> 11:55.256
Your first birthday party!

11:55.537 --> 11:58.220
First one ever!

11:58.280 --> 12:03.487
You know, I love the barns and I sang my favorite songs for you.

12:04.912 --> 12:09.396
Thank you Ruffians for having so much fun together with me!

12:09.976 --> 12:13.900
I'll never ever forget it!

12:13.920 --> 12:19.044
We also received some birthday messages and gifts from Advent.

12:19.484 --> 12:25.429
I also got a really sweet letter from you, Moco-chan!

12:28.592 --> 12:30.874
What was it that you called me, Moco-chan?

12:34.574 --> 12:36.299
Nothing!

12:42.799 --> 12:44.760
I was so happy!

12:45.480 --> 12:52.142
Thank you, Ruffians, for making me the happiest and fluffiest demon dog in the world!

12:52.362 --> 12:54.723
BAU BAU!

12:54.963 --> 12:55.423
But!

12:56.143 --> 12:57.404
Today!

12:58.064 --> 13:01.845
Today is Moco-chan's birthday!

13:01.885 --> 13:03.806
Your big day!

13:04.206 --> 13:05.866
Happy birthday, Moco-chan.

13:05.966 --> 13:08.207
BAU BAU!

13:08.567 --> 13:10.868
The birthday celebration never would stop.

13:12.149 --> 13:18.873
Make sure you don't forget about my birthday too, okay?

13:19.073 --> 13:24.637
The 48-hour FUWAMOCO Birthday continues, Ruffians!

13:25.218 --> 13:27.479
BAU BAU!

13:29.501 --> 13:31.082
I can't believe it, you know.

13:31.542 --> 13:34.204
We get to have such a special FUWAMOCO Morning.

13:34.264 --> 13:35.925
A birthday FUWAMOCO Morning.

13:36.025 --> 13:36.385
Why?

13:37.666 --> 13:43.427
You know, Mama Puppy would always celebrate our birthday morning very specially, BAU.

13:43.988 --> 13:48.089
Well, this is just about right up there, huh?

13:48.909 --> 13:50.409
BAU BAU!

13:51.049 --> 13:52.310
Wow, Ruffians!

13:52.810 --> 13:59.211
Not only was it my birthday, but I also had a little surprise for you.

13:59.652 --> 14:04.373
I announced my first birthday merch!

14:04.413 --> 14:04.813
BAU BAU!

14:06.545 --> 14:14.672
I feel so excited and happy to be able to share this with you, Ruffians!

14:15.733 --> 14:16.554
Do you see?

14:18.016 --> 14:24.342
My birthday merch has such a beautiful illustration by Miwami Sakura-sensei!

14:24.702 --> 14:25.323
You know?

14:26.023 --> 14:28.646
And, well, you can see it right here, nice and big.

14:28.666 --> 14:30.328
Do you want to take a closer look?

14:31.028 --> 14:45.692
But, while here's my birthday mindset, if you really want to be able to enjoy the illustration even more, well, I have a dual-lid acrylic pa- acrylic!

14:46.012 --> 14:47.052
What did you say?

14:47.192 --> 14:48.653
Acrylic paddle!

14:49.033 --> 14:54.454
As well as also a bonus postcard with my signature printed in gold on it.

14:54.554 --> 14:55.115
Right.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.956
It's not very often that you get to see my signature, huh, Ruffians?

14:59.196 --> 14:59.596
But!

15:01.617 --> 15:02.037
Hi!

15:02.738 --> 15:12.425
I think, you know, this is maybe what I'm looking for the very, very most, I'm most excited for this!

15:12.785 --> 15:13.666
The Ruffian!

15:13.746 --> 15:14.327
Ruffian!

15:14.587 --> 15:15.287
Ruffian!

15:15.367 --> 15:16.628
BAU BAU!

15:16.688 --> 15:18.270
Look at him!

15:18.810 --> 15:20.631
He's so cute!

15:20.692 --> 15:23.033
With the little glasses there!

15:23.694 --> 15:24.554
Little legs!

15:24.775 --> 15:25.996
Ruffians!

15:26.816 --> 15:29.278
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:29.298 --> 15:29.598
BAU BAU!

15:29.638 --> 15:31.899
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:31.919 --> 15:32.600
BAU BAU!

15:32.620 --> 15:37.063
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

15:53.939 --> 16:00.063
You know, I hope that you'll decide to give lots of hugs, lots of head pats, too.

16:00.884 --> 16:02.985
I'm definitely looking forward to it, too.

16:03.866 --> 16:04.566
BAU BAU!

16:04.846 --> 16:08.829
And we have my Fuwawa motif t-shirt!

16:09.329 --> 16:12.291
Now, you might think, oh, it's just a white t-shirt.

16:12.431 --> 16:13.232
It is not!

16:13.512 --> 16:14.453
Don't you dare!

16:14.813 --> 16:20.337
Look, it has my little flames just like on my cool jacket here.

16:20.737 --> 16:23.519
And our Advent branding label there.

16:24.139 --> 16:29.342
And on the background, we have some very cute Fuwawa pondering.

16:29.382 --> 16:31.743
With my name right there.

16:32.103 --> 16:34.945
You know it's nice because, well, it's not like...

16:36.109 --> 16:45.355
If you had my face big and printed on it, maybe it might be hard to like, where if you're gonna go, maybe see your parents, you know?

16:46.796 --> 16:49.558
But this way, you can still be like, yes!

16:50.599 --> 16:51.419
Yeah!

16:51.679 --> 16:53.220
Way to work, okay!

16:53.801 --> 16:56.403
It's very work appropriate.

16:56.643 --> 16:59.405
You know they have the, what's the word?

17:00.025 --> 17:01.346
The Fridays.

17:01.446 --> 17:02.887
You know the casual Fridays?

17:02.967 --> 17:05.228
Casual Fridays!

17:06.691 --> 17:08.797
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

17:16.712 --> 17:21.835
But not just that, we also have my FUWAMOCO keychain!

17:22.575 --> 17:24.996
Look, my fluffy tail's there!

17:25.177 --> 17:29.819
But, well, unlike the actual thing, this time it's made out of rubber.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.700
My tail is not rubber.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.022
It's not that fluffy, huh?

17:35.383 --> 17:37.584
In reality, it's very fluffy.

17:37.744 --> 17:41.926
But we also have an acrylic pattern with my name there!

17:42.387 --> 17:44.108
That way you know you can-

17:46.562 --> 17:47.703
Bless you.

17:47.823 --> 17:49.244
Happy birthday bless you.

17:49.744 --> 17:52.326
Birthday sneeze!

17:52.386 --> 17:57.028
But this way there's no way you can get confused and think, oh this is Moco-chan's tail.

17:57.528 --> 17:59.029
No, it's mine.

18:00.130 --> 18:00.970
Exactly!

18:01.771 --> 18:02.971
BAU BAU!

18:03.972 --> 18:09.075
And well, we also have an extra special birthday voice part.

18:10.354 --> 18:12.421
Special situation boys and all.

18:12.763 --> 18:15.854
You know how FUWAMOCO really like going on walks?

18:17.031 --> 18:21.614
Well, I wanted to go on a little bit of a forest adventure with you.

18:21.654 --> 18:23.795
So, I hope that you'll listen to it.

18:23.835 --> 18:26.517
It's recorded in Japanese and English.

18:27.037 --> 18:33.642
So, please listen to it and maybe you can see, oh, a lot of different sides of Fuwawa, too.

18:34.422 --> 18:37.204
BAU BAU!

18:37.304 --> 18:39.806
And we have the complete set.

18:40.166 --> 18:43.208
If you purchase it, you get a little bit of a bonus.

18:43.648 --> 18:44.489
It comes with a

18:45.009 --> 18:48.597
Appreciation voice also in Japanese and English.

18:48.998 --> 18:54.690
You know, because I really, really want to be able to say a big thank you to you.

18:56.173 --> 19:00.154
And well, I know there was a limited edition set.

19:00.694 --> 19:05.915
Thank you, Ruffians, so much for getting your paws on them.

19:06.035 --> 19:09.496
I think it sold out in a few seconds.

19:09.556 --> 19:10.776
Very, very fast.

19:10.856 --> 19:11.736
Very fast.

19:12.197 --> 19:18.098
But the limited edition, it came with my very own handwritten autograph.

19:18.138 --> 19:19.058
But don't worry about that.

19:19.669 --> 19:40.976
Cause there's also the complete set and like I mentioned there's a postcard with Miwabe Sakura-sensei's illustration on it and also with my signature printed gold on it too. So I really hope that you'll pick up the complete set because there's so many exciting goodies in it, you know, and well...

19:42.757 --> 19:51.680
I just feel so lucky and so happy to be able to have this opportunity to be able to release merch as a member of hololive.

19:52.440 --> 19:59.722
I really hope that Ruffians are as excited as me and that you'll check them out, okay?

20:00.322 --> 20:04.123
Everything which will only be on sale until the beginning of March.

20:04.463 --> 20:06.544
So don't miss out, okay Ruffians?

20:06.724 --> 20:08.985
Not that long of a window, huh?

20:09.425 --> 20:09.865
Oh, wait.

20:11.182 --> 20:16.115
I'm also Ruffians.

20:19.088 --> 20:19.989
BAU BAU!

20:21.149 --> 20:24.831
Thank you!

20:27.432 --> 20:29.614
Nothing funny, nothing silly.

20:30.334 --> 20:32.295
BAU BAU!

20:32.495 --> 20:36.197
Thank you, Ruffians!

20:36.857 --> 20:41.540
Now you know it's just the exciting part until we can get our paws on them.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.521
BAU BAU!

20:44.521 --> 20:47.282
Well, the excitement doesn't end.

20:47.302 --> 20:48.562
It does not end!

20:48.842 --> 20:53.724
This week it's been a bit of a rollercoaster that's just going up, up, up, up!

20:54.164 --> 20:55.924
You know, it happens six more times a week.

20:55.944 --> 20:57.685
That makes it sound like it's gonna go down.

20:57.705 --> 21:00.985
Uh, when it goes down... No!

21:02.366 --> 21:06.387
But when the rollercoaster goes down, that's when generally the fun happens, right?

21:09.292 --> 21:10.113
It's just going up.

21:11.814 --> 21:18.358
But it's been, Advent 6 month anniversary and now our birthday too!

21:18.819 --> 21:27.745
But you know, there's also been something very exciting coming around the corner too.

21:29.806 --> 21:32.408
A certain pink and

21:33.527 --> 21:36.309
Red holiday perhaps?

21:37.170 --> 21:37.770
Yeah!

21:38.351 --> 21:40.772
Valentine's Day!

21:40.892 --> 21:41.853
BAU BAU!

21:42.093 --> 21:49.819
And to celebrate it, hololive has released a collection of Valentine's voice packs for 2024!

21:49.919 --> 21:52.801
BAU BAU!

21:53.441 --> 21:59.806
And while at FUWAMOCO, we're participating in it along with Advent too!

21:59.926 --> 22:00.867
Look, Shiori!

22:02.728 --> 22:05.510
Of course the Watame-senpai.

22:05.530 --> 22:11.895
I don't want to lose out to Watame-senpai's fluffiness.

22:13.336 --> 22:23.664
But, well, Ruffians, you know, doing this voice pack, it was my first time doing something like this and we were really nervous.

22:26.630 --> 22:37.640
Even with all the excitement that birthday's going on, we really hope that you'll check them out, listen to them, and maybe accept our feelings too.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.782
I know.

22:39.862 --> 22:42.905
It was... embarrassing, but...

22:46.756 --> 22:48.197
I did my best, okay?

22:48.217 --> 22:49.197
I know!

22:49.358 --> 22:52.419
We have Japanese and English versions!

22:52.820 --> 23:01.204
Please definitely look... Look at them!

23:01.604 --> 23:02.425
Listen to them!

23:02.485 --> 23:04.126
Look at them with your ears open!

23:04.146 --> 23:06.887
Look at them with your ears, okay?

23:07.188 --> 23:09.609
Did we write the scripts?

23:11.330 --> 23:12.831
Well... I know!

23:14.827 --> 23:20.332
There's a lot of birthday excitement too right now.

23:36.795 --> 23:43.078
I think we'd really like to be able to hear your response to our Valentine voices too!

23:43.278 --> 23:43.558
But!

23:43.898 --> 23:46.319
They'll be available until the beginning of April.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.660
So don't worry, okay?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.361
We'll make sure you don't miss it!

23:50.501 --> 23:51.301
BAU BAU!

23:51.361 --> 23:52.662
Thank you, I love you!

23:52.702 --> 23:53.442
Don't forget though.

23:53.842 --> 23:54.563
It's my birthday.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.865
It is my birthday.

23:57.025 --> 23:58.728
Valentine still has to wake up.

23:58.928 --> 23:59.889
Wait a few weeks.

24:00.069 --> 24:01.191
It dies, okay?

24:01.691 --> 24:04.315
So, Mococo's birthday!

24:04.895 --> 24:05.196
BAU BAU!

24:05.236 --> 24:08.039
Ruffians!

24:12.645 --> 24:18.468
It seems like we've received an important FUWAMOCO scoop from our Ruffians!

24:19.088 --> 24:23.570
Thank you so much, Soyoneko, for the impeccable journalism!

24:23.630 --> 24:24.150
BAU BAU!

24:24.190 --> 24:38.517
Wow, like I mentioned, you know, this week wasn't just filled with special milestones and anniversaries, but we also had some amazing new outfits from our DP-senpai!

24:38.677 --> 24:39.557
Look!

24:41.958 --> 24:46.121
La+-senpai revealed her first new outfit!

24:46.481 --> 24:48.182
An outfit that she designed herself!

24:48.282 --> 24:49.503
You know it!

24:50.203 --> 24:51.404
Very very cool!

24:51.524 --> 24:53.405
Very fitting!

24:53.425 --> 24:57.147
And you know the fire design even moves around!

24:58.368 --> 24:59.208
Crazy.

24:59.588 --> 25:00.609
Well, I don't know.

25:01.009 --> 25:03.309
She looks a little grown up now.

25:03.329 --> 25:03.930
Does she?

25:05.890 --> 25:07.051
Oh, uh, wait.

25:07.491 --> 25:11.532
Maybe Mofu is- Is that a bit rude to say to a senpai?

25:13.392 --> 25:14.933
Alright!

25:15.653 --> 25:19.194
And you can see her tummy now, too.

25:19.474 --> 25:20.875
Just a bit.

25:21.975 --> 25:24.076
Don't get tummy empty, okay, Moco-chan?

25:28.587 --> 25:36.810
Also, Okayu-senpai showed off her special new trial model that she'll be using during her ASMR membership stream!

25:36.910 --> 25:39.010
It's so cute!

25:39.430 --> 25:48.033
And you know, I, I, I, feel, feel the ears if she's feeling a little bit warm.

25:49.554 --> 25:52.875
She can, uh, zip down the jacket too.

25:53.415 --> 25:57.616
So, uh, zip reveals some, uh, cute, uh,

26:00.266 --> 26:01.926
Under pajamas!

26:03.307 --> 26:04.067
Pajamas!

26:04.167 --> 26:04.888
Pajamas!

26:06.248 --> 26:07.069
Under pajamas.

26:07.409 --> 26:08.649
Pajamas!

26:09.530 --> 26:10.670
Oh my gosh.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.611
BAU BAU!

26:15.652 --> 26:18.473
Wow, they're both super cute!

26:18.873 --> 26:21.114
Congratulations on the new outfit!

26:21.214 --> 26:23.174
A new model of Senpai!

26:23.534 --> 26:25.595
Okayu Senpai!

26:25.675 --> 26:28.796
BAU BAU!

26:28.836 --> 26:29.416
Pajamas!

26:33.134 --> 26:39.459
Sometimes I feel a bit warm too, but... BAU BAU!

26:39.859 --> 26:53.109
Well, Ruffians, you know, with it being our birthday and everything, obviously Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy have been really excited and wish us a big happy birthday too!

26:57.964 --> 27:05.810
Actually, Mama Puppy came by quickly with some handmade cakes just like she used to make us!

27:05.890 --> 27:07.411
BAU BAU!

27:08.071 --> 27:10.033
What do you think, Ruffians?

27:12.094 --> 27:14.016
They're super cute, right?

27:14.296 --> 27:15.598
You know what?

27:15.698 --> 27:22.324
Mama puppy was actually sulking a little bit because she said that they didn't turn out as well as she'd hoped.

27:22.644 --> 27:26.288
They look great, right?

27:26.308 --> 27:31.373
You know, they sort of look like cupcakes, but they're actually around the size of two cupcakes.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.573
Right!

27:32.713 --> 27:41.975
Yeah, so we shared my cake together yesterday, and we'll be sharing Moco-chan's cake together later today, right?

27:42.095 --> 27:42.795
Yeah!

27:42.855 --> 27:44.816
It was really delicious, though!

27:45.196 --> 27:50.497
The frosting, it wasn't too sweet, and the cake, it was light and fluffy!

27:50.897 --> 27:54.898
Because, you know, it's my FUWAMOCAKE!

27:54.978 --> 27:59.299
I hope that, you know, mine's not fuzzy on the inside.

27:59.879 --> 28:00.639
We'll have to see.

28:01.880 --> 28:13.927
We feel really really lucky to have such a loving mama puppy and papa puppy on top of having you here by our side, Ruffians!

28:14.528 --> 28:17.350
We're the luckiest puppies ever, huh, Moco-chan?

28:18.971 --> 28:20.231
BAU BAU!

28:23.193 --> 28:27.158
Next we have for you, the Doggie of the Day!

28:27.198 --> 28:31.523
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

28:32.945 --> 28:33.826
Aria!

28:34.287 --> 28:36.229
Can you believe it, Ruffians?

28:36.850 --> 28:39.753
It's Aria's birthday today too!

28:39.793 --> 28:42.456
Moco-chan has the same birthday.

28:43.457 --> 28:44.618
Happy birthday, Oryo!

28:44.678 --> 28:46.419
Happy birthday!

28:46.779 --> 28:49.560
Congrats on your sixth birthday!

28:49.600 --> 28:51.381
You're just a puppy that's high.

28:52.122 --> 28:53.162
High.

28:53.422 --> 28:54.643
I guess, yeah.

28:54.703 --> 29:00.026
But, you know, she loves napping, so hopefully she won't sleep through it.

29:00.086 --> 29:00.506
I know.

29:00.966 --> 29:01.667
Definitely not.

29:01.727 --> 29:03.128
How does Oryo BAU BAU?

Oryo's birthday!

29:37.910 --> 29:41.932
And you know, she's been with you for so many birthdays.

29:41.952 --> 29:43.172
But she's still a puppy.

29:43.633 --> 29:48.695
Yeah, there'll be many more birthdays, many more wonderful memories together.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.797
And I think I can tell she's looking forward to lots more tweets.

29:53.957 --> 29:55.317
That's what the face says, huh?

29:55.717 --> 29:58.498
Yeah, especially those birthday tweets today.

29:59.038 --> 30:02.079
And also even more cuddles from you two.

30:02.159 --> 30:02.819

30:14.023 --> 30:16.064
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

This world really is hot.

30:50.454 --> 30:55.115
Next, for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

30:55.615 --> 30:56.536
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

30:57.376 --> 30:57.596
Hello!

30:58.036 --> 31:03.838
I was wondering, was there a specific moment that made you want to join hololive yourselves?

31:03.858 --> 31:13.460
Or was it something you wanted from the moment you figured out that Akai Hato was not, in fact, a visual novel heroine?

31:13.980 --> 31:16.121
That's such a good question.

31:17.785 --> 31:18.225
Wow.

31:18.505 --> 31:39.392
Well, you know, Haachama-senpai, she helped introduce us into what hololive was, but what really made us want to be a part of the hololive family was just all our talented senpai from all over the world with so many different experiences, talents, and personalities.

31:39.512 --> 31:45.334
You know, seeing their strength, growth, them working hard all together for their dreams.

31:46.917 --> 31:49.078
It really resonated with us, you know?

31:49.338 --> 31:50.798
You know, especially with us.

31:50.818 --> 31:54.839
We're such hungry puppies too.

31:55.960 --> 31:59.261
Plus, you know, we really, we haven't found our duty yet.

31:59.661 --> 32:02.422
We haven't found really our place, so...

32:03.662 --> 32:06.225
We're really, really happy to be here now.

32:06.485 --> 32:08.868
And now we can protect your smiles!

32:09.288 --> 32:11.210
BAU BAU!

32:11.230 --> 32:12.472
Thank you!

32:12.532 --> 32:17.217
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today.

32:17.557 --> 32:20.620
Thank you for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.361
BAU BAU!

32:22.502 --> 32:23.223
Don't forget!

32:24.384 --> 32:30.107
Use the hashtag "hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning" and "hashtag FUWAMOCO Scoop" for your scoops!

32:30.367 --> 32:31.328
BAU BAU!

32:31.868 --> 32:37.571
And for our next stream, what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?

32:37.591 --> 32:40.312
It couldn't be a big party or anything, right?

32:40.692 --> 32:48.116
Today, it's Moco-chan's birthday!

32:48.376 --> 32:50.277
You haven't forgotten, right, Ruffians?

32:51.320 --> 32:54.161
Now, we didn't mention it a bazillion times, huh?

32:54.441 --> 32:56.562
It's my birthday party today!

32:56.602 --> 33:00.503
So you know, I'm gonna have a solo karaoke concert as well!

33:01.003 --> 33:06.305
We're gonna have lots of fun together, cuz that's what I want!

33:06.565 --> 33:07.165
Okay.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.625
You're very ready!

33:08.645 --> 33:10.926
Thank you!

33:11.006 --> 33:12.186
Let's all chill out!

33:12.206 --> 33:13.547
I'm not nervous.

33:13.567 --> 33:16.548
I'm not nervous!

33:25.612 --> 33:30.496
I also need you to be there to hold my paw a little bit.

33:30.796 --> 33:33.498
We'll be cheering really loud for you, Moco-chan.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.700
BAU BAUing from the audience, okay?

33:36.060 --> 33:37.321
Me and the Ruffians.

33:43.846 --> 33:45.628
That's what you're gonna do from the audience.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.870
Yeah, I'm getting all prepared.

33:48.450 --> 33:49.050
Practiced.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.231
BAU BAU!

33:52.491 --> 33:55.792
Let me take a quick peek at our schedule!

33:56.192 --> 34:00.994
Well, after all our birthday excitement, after Moco-chan's birthday is over,

34:01.874 --> 34:07.757
You know, we clean up the decorations and we finally say goodbye to our FUWAMOCO birthday.

34:07.777 --> 34:08.317
48 hours!

34:08.598 --> 34:10.799
48 hours!

34:11.539 --> 34:16.422
We'll be continuing our saga in Metal Gear Solid 2!

34:17.402 --> 34:20.704
But this time, can we actually save the president?

34:21.084 --> 34:22.785
You know, the people may be like, save the president!

34:22.805 --> 34:24.086
Oh wait, no, first this.

34:24.626 --> 34:24.966
Right.

34:25.247 --> 34:25.947
We'll see!

34:26.147 --> 34:26.707
We'll see.

34:28.188 --> 34:29.809
