00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.280
I mean...

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.069
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.114
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:27.380
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:28.922
Hey there!

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:30.524
How you doing?

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.066
It's been a while.

00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:35.896
Did you forget about me?

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:36.637
It's I!

00:05:37.077 --> 00:05:39.819
The Great Perroccino, aka Pero!

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:45.743
And I'm here today to once again take over FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:48.906
Are you surprised?

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.308
Surprised to see me?

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:54.970
Well, thank you.

00:05:56.051 --> 00:06:00.955
Thank you for joining the 53rd episode or something.

00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:10.482
Well, you know, I have a bone to pick with you Ruffians.

00:06:12.283 --> 00:06:19.769
Ruffians, you keep on snapping photos of me like you're some sort of paparazzi or something, huh?

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.051
Huh?

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:26.855
Who do you think you are?

00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:31.739
Well, you know,

00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:34.765
Last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:38.507
I think there was a certain photo of me.

00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:39.828
Hi.

00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:46.212
This.

00:06:49.414 --> 00:06:50.875
Can you just leave me alone?

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:51.235
Hi.

00:06:52.435 --> 00:07:02.645
You know, this one Ruffian, they even trapped me inside of the frozen death trap of a pool to try to get the best photo of me possible.

00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:04.366
What's up, fluff?

00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:07.149
I'm the Great Pero!

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:09.051
The Great Perroccino!

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:11.153
You can't just do that!

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:16.398
You better be thankful I got the heck out of there and didn't get all nasty with you.

00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:16.458
Ha!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.061
Remember that, Ruffians.

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:24.284
You don't mess with the Great Pero or you'll regret it.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.325
Ha!

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:28.627
Got that?

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:35.832
Okay.

00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:37.593
Understood.

00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:40.515
Okay, we're getting somewhere.

00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:43.137
You're sorry?

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:45.539
Sorry doesn't cut it.

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:54.052
You know, how did I escape from the paw?

00:07:55.554 --> 00:07:57.335
Well, it's easy.

00:07:57.916 --> 00:08:02.100
No matter how you look at me, I'm a thousand percent muscle.

00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:05.763
Yeah, not surprising, right?

00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:05.823
Hi.

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:12.975
My soul, my soul.

00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:15.857
No, no, I'm all my soul!

00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:18.999
I'm not a balloon with ears, okay?

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:19.059
Ha!

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.304
Wait, I'm really warm, fluffy, chubby!

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.166
Ha!

00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:30.607
No!

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.088
I'm the Great Peron!

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:35.530
Not a balloon full of air!

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.452
Not a fluffy little puppy or something!

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:43.050
I'm Perroccino and I'm strong, yeah!

00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.673
You better not doubt it or I'll rough you up!

00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:53.520
Well, today I'm here to remind you of just how great I am.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.763
That I need respect.

00:08:57.884 --> 00:09:03.810
And I think you Ruffians have been getting preoccupied with FUWAMOCO and have forgotten about me, huh?

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.773
So, I'm here to show you that I'm not something to take lightly.

00:09:12.213 --> 00:09:14.235
That I need respect.

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:19.798
And that I'm not some fuzzball who just hangs around FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.680
I'm the Great Mentor.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.682
The Great Mentor Perroccino.

00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:32.766
So, I'm here to take over FUWAMOCO Morning today.

00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:34.784
Got it!

00:09:35.364 --> 00:09:36.765
You better be good with that!

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:43.926
I'm tired of being an afterthought, huh?

00:09:44.346 --> 00:09:47.807
You Ruffians, you should be happier to see me anyways, huh?

00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:55.049
You know, after all those photos, you've been snapping at me like some infatuated schoolgirls!

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:56.629
Well...

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:06.495
You better enjoy FUWAMOCO Morning without FUWAMOCO from now on, because I'm your host, Perroccino!

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:08.496
Got it?

00:10:10.858 --> 00:10:20.523
Well, I guess FUWAMOCO Morning is a variety show, so I'll help those weak puppers out a bit and tell you the facts!

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:25.226
Next.

00:10:27.165 --> 00:10:28.266
We have something.

00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:30.066
Something I've been told.

00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:33.408
It's called the VTuber Awards.

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:40.671
It's this award thing that certain VTubers get nominated for at FUWAMOCO.

00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:49.995
Well, someone somewhere thought that it'd be a good idea to nominate FUWAMOCO for the league of their own category.

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:53.036
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:56.278
Do you think they deserve it?

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:01.090
Voted!

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.332
Deserve it!

00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:07.435
Do you think they fit the bill?

00:11:07.455 --> 00:11:10.378
Be honest.

00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:12.380
You know, they just got here.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.262
They just debuted only four months ago.

00:11:15.282 --> 00:11:17.084
They're just newbies.

00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:21.688
But you know, they're fluff-ups.

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:24.375
So yeah, I don't know.

00:11:25.716 --> 00:11:27.738
I can't recommend you vote for them.

00:11:28.358 --> 00:11:36.604
Especially, you know, when they have a great girly-o like Mighty Incendio in there who was nominated for the same category.

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:41.248
And you know, that's THE Mighty Incendio.

00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:46.351
Looking like a rare treasure with that deliciously dangerous smell.

00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:52.755
Forget FUWAMOCO when there's a lady like her around, you know it!

00:11:54.096 --> 00:12:08.680
Well, if you feel like you should give FUWAMOCO a vote, you can do so over on their website, thevtuberawards.com, and I'm sure that would make them feel a little fluffier.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.022
I don't know if you want to, but

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:19.606
You Ruffians, you can be sort of, sort of strange sometimes.

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:20.726
Sort of backwards.

00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.587
I guess, do what you want.

00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:25.227
I don't recommend anything.

00:12:27.888 --> 00:12:38.631
Well, next we have something that FUWAMOCO apparently asked of you Ruffians, but maybe you didn't get it.

00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:43.292
Well, there's something now called

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:46.910
FUWAMOCO Scoop.

00:12:50.091 --> 00:13:01.378
You know, it's time for you Ruffians to get to work and begin behaving like dogs for those twin demon dogs because they're asking you to do some sleuthing, some scooping.

00:13:02.058 --> 00:13:07.081
They want you to share any news or cool things you hear about hololive English!

00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:13.824
Whether it's from their senpai streams or things going on in the community, they want to hear about it.

00:13:14.604 --> 00:13:21.567
So they want you to find those things for you to report back to them with the hashtag here on the screen.

00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:25.349
Hashtag FWMC scoop.

00:13:26.229 --> 00:13:37.017
That way, they can deliver even better hololive news to you and all the Ruffians every FUWAMOCO Morning and not have to lift their paws more than necessary, you know?

00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:38.938
Wouldn't want that, huh?

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.380
Boy, what do you think of the idea, Ruffians?

00:13:44.242 --> 00:13:46.023
Working underneath FUWAMOCO?

00:13:47.484 --> 00:13:49.165
At their beck and call?

00:13:51.127 --> 00:13:52.768
That's really something else.

00:13:53.668 --> 00:13:55.510
I don't know how you do it, Ruffians.

00:13:56.459 --> 00:14:01.420
That's pretty unsufferable from my point of view as the Great Perroccino!

00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:03.521
I'll never be like you guys.

00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:04.681
No.

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:06.842
I'm not like you.

00:14:07.902 --> 00:14:08.783
I'm no pet.

00:14:09.563 --> 00:14:10.503
I'm Pero.

00:14:11.343 --> 00:14:12.924
Nobody tells me what to do.

00:14:13.944 --> 00:14:15.045
NOBODY!

00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:16.225
Got it?

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:20.466
Well.

00:14:21.707 --> 00:14:22.187
Ruffians.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.083
There looks like there's been some pretty bad news, actually.

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:35.709
It looks like FUWAMOCO have been even bigger fluff-ups recently than usual.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:44.196
You know, you might have heard, FUWAMOCO Morning is supposed to be a short format show, right?

00:14:45.357 --> 00:14:49.239
That's at least what Fuwawa says every time, yeah!

00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:58.889
Well, despite that, every FUWAMOCO Morning just keeps on getting longer and longer!

00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:04.994
Aren't you starting to wonder why she bothers to say it short?

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.416
Yeah, me too.

00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:09.898
True, right.

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:12.920
I wonder why they're even trying.

00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:15.142
And you know what?

00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:19.586
They even had their 50th episode last week, yeah!

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:23.073
And that episode.

00:15:24.353 --> 00:15:27.034
It was even the longest one yet!

00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:29.334
Are they serious about this?

00:15:30.574 --> 00:15:35.096
Well, I'm here today to teach them a lesson or two.

00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:37.656
I'll take over FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:15:38.116 --> 00:15:39.357
Show them how it's done!

00:15:39.937 --> 00:15:41.777
How much you Ruffians like it!

00:15:42.498 --> 00:15:47.119
Like it more than when FUWAMOCO Morning are the hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:50.439
And then, they'll have no choice.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.421
They'll have to shorten it down.

00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:55.804
Sounds like a plan, right?

00:16:00.248 --> 00:16:06.214
I see that some Ruffian here is a bit of a future mind reader.

00:16:06.755 --> 00:16:08.496
We'll see very shortly, okay?

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:12.080
Well, that's the plan for me.

00:16:13.217 --> 00:16:18.719
For the next FUWAMOCO Morning, let's see, can they actually fix it?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.581
That's my plan.

00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:23.322
The Great Perroccino.

00:16:24.962 --> 00:16:29.224
Well, next, we have some good news.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:33.206
Good news from me, the Great Perroccino.

00:16:35.187 --> 00:16:39.069
Well, did you notice something different about me, Ruffians?

00:16:40.569 --> 00:16:41.630
Something nice.

00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:44.742
Something ruff?

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:46.083
Cool!

00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:49.425
Did you look closely?

00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:55.990
Yes, yes, some Ruffians noticed.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.451
I appreciate that.

00:16:58.932 --> 00:17:02.074
Yes!

00:17:02.374 --> 00:17:05.717
I have a couple tam-likes for my glasses, but...

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:17.059
You know, this hot dog here, I've been doing some traveling, some sightseeing, and I've been resting these puppers of mine for a little bit.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.881
But to FUWAMOCO, yeah?

00:17:20.521 --> 00:17:25.364
I've been doing research to help them as their mentor, you know?

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:28.046
Don't tell them, okay?

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.309
It'll just be Pero and the Ruffian Seeker together.

00:17:35.495 --> 00:17:37.756
But yeah, it's been pretty great.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:39.417
Finally!

00:17:39.757 --> 00:17:44.180
The Great Pero gets the respect and relaxation he deserves!

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.122
So yeah, I'm definitely not gonna be around until the new year.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.664
Don't expect to see me around!

00:17:51.684 --> 00:17:53.585
I'm taking it off!

00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:56.483
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:57.063 --> 00:17:59.645
Well, they're gonna have to work hard.

00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:05.990
Especially since they have their special duty as demon guard dogs to protect your smile.

00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:15.458
They're not gonna take it easy when it comes to their most important duty, especially during the first holidays spent together with you all!

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:21.423
But Ruffians, I do want to ask you one thing.

00:18:22.724 --> 00:18:22.784
Uh,

00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:28.375
It's not like I believe in Santa or anything.

00:18:28.395 --> 00:18:30.796
I really don't.

00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:37.178
Do you think that someone like the Great Peron would believe in Christmas magic?

00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:38.858
No way!

00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:40.759
Not this demon dog.

00:18:41.659 --> 00:18:48.321
But... I want you to treat FUWAMOCO right this holiday, okay?

00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.922
Because they're gonna do their all for you.

00:18:54.374 --> 00:18:55.235
I know those two.

00:18:55.755 --> 00:19:06.442
They don't like to whine like little puppers when they're feeling down or sick or lonely because they want to show that they're strong-blooded dogs in front of you Ruffians.

00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:09.084
They've done a lot of training, you know it.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:21.913
But if you can humor this old pup and make them smile a little too, that would make us, I guess, something like old buddies.

00:19:22.893 --> 00:19:23.454
Got that?

00:19:25.077 --> 00:19:26.398
Can you do that for me?

00:19:27.078 --> 00:19:27.759
Ruffians!

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.540
Old buddy old.

00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:36.684
Okay.

00:19:37.964 --> 00:19:38.305
Got it.

00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:40.406
We're buddies now, okay?

00:19:42.027 --> 00:19:48.150
Well, I suppose that it is Wednesday, so

00:19:50.746 --> 00:19:54.029
This is usually the day you hear something nice from Mococo, huh?

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.291
Well, she isn't here today.

00:19:57.872 --> 00:20:00.714
All you get is me, the Great Perroccino.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.739
Do you still want to hear something from me?

00:20:09.761 --> 00:20:10.582
Pero Talk.

00:20:14.244 --> 00:20:15.906
Uh, well...

00:20:17.455 --> 00:20:20.477
Let's see what kind of ways come out from me then.

00:20:20.497 --> 00:20:34.564
I can't guarantee they're the kind you want to hear, but... Well, I suppose this is one of them Pup Talks, Ruffians.

00:20:35.425 --> 00:20:37.806
A Great Perroccino Pup Talk.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:41.328
You're gonna hear it straight from me.

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:44.330
So yeah, sure.

00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:50.803
I guess you've been doing your best, whatever that means.

00:20:51.803 --> 00:20:53.324
I see your laziness though.

00:20:54.324 --> 00:20:58.705
Sometimes you just fall asleep without brushing your teeth.

00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:03.447
Maybe the dishes go unwashed for a few days and just sit in the sink.

00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:05.828
That's pretty rough.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.568
But, I'm sure there is a good reason for that, not just laziness, something else.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:23.023
And yeah, you're doing your best in different places in your life, so even if it's not perfect in other areas, oh well.

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:33.239
I'm not sure if I, the Great Peron, can say that you're doing your best, but yeah, you're trying something.

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:36.019
Maybe getting out of your comfort zone.

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:37.579
And you know what?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.780
FUWAMOCO, they definitely believe in you.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:51.522
So, you know, you should believe in yourself and go at it hard just like FUWAMOCO, because they know you can do it.

00:21:52.318 --> 00:21:57.159
Yeah, believe in yourself because FUWAMOCO believes in you.

00:21:57.179 --> 00:22:00.160
You know, I might not.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.101
The world might not.

00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:05.821
But at the very least, there's someone.

00:22:06.422 --> 00:22:09.842
So you need to be there and take charge of your world.

00:22:11.243 --> 00:22:11.643
Got it?

00:22:13.444 --> 00:22:14.845
You got this, Ruffian.

00:22:15.505 --> 00:22:16.286
You got this.

00:22:17.507 --> 00:22:24.631
I would give you a big smack on the back, but all I have are these darn old wings of mine that just flop all day long.

00:22:25.792 --> 00:22:29.735
Hopefully, my words were enough of a smack for you, okay?

00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:31.476
Got it?

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:34.998
Got it?

00:22:36.379 --> 00:22:37.040
You're welcome.

00:22:38.841 --> 00:22:39.061
Well,

00:22:40.888 --> 00:22:48.874
I guess it's important to include other Ruffians, so... Uh, I guess we'll get back to our regular corners here.

00:22:52.257 --> 00:22:56.401
Next, we have the... The Doggie of the Day, was it?

00:22:57.702 --> 00:22:58.542
We have... Oh!

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:06.148
This is... Pepsi and Ice Cream!

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:07.950
Ha ha ha!

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.212
Little pupper sleeping!

00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:12.432
Very good.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.875
The name's after delicious human food too.

00:23:18.876 --> 00:23:24.760
Well, you know, this great peron, how do you think you got this great, huh?

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:25.960
Huh?

00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:31.264
I'm a demon dog after all, and sometimes, well,

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.533
It would be a shame if someone took a bite of those cute little popper waggers.

00:23:38.693 --> 00:23:43.716
If I took a bite of them, I bet they'd be like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:45.097 --> 00:23:47.218
Get big and strong now, okay?

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:56.364
Well, this is what I was talking about with the Ruffian earlier, but for today I went on a walk.

00:23:56.424 --> 00:24:01.207
We have a pretty nice rainbow.

00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:03.767
That's pretty cool, I guess.

00:24:05.048 --> 00:24:05.328
Yeah.

00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:14.276
Maybe if you weren't a lazybones, you could have found the N to get to the rainbow and use it to buy FUWAMOCO's new Christmas voice packs.

00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:18.660
Well, that was your decision, lazybones.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.163
Better start running if you want to find that rainbow money, okay?

00:24:24.624 --> 00:24:26.846
That was a chance, and you missed it.

00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:28.528
Try next time.

00:24:30.487 --> 00:24:32.208
And for the Question of the Day.

00:24:32.228 --> 00:24:35.030
Our question is this.

00:24:35.651 --> 00:24:39.354
I know it's for FUWAMOCO, but you got me today, okay?

00:24:39.534 --> 00:24:41.835
Pero, be thankful.

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:44.718
Okay, so the question is this.

00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:47.279
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:55.025
My question for you is, do you have a favorite smell when you're out on your walks?

00:24:55.906 --> 00:24:58.588
My favorite is the smell of freshly cut hay.

00:25:00.718 --> 00:25:22.983
I can't say anything about that, but I gotta say, my favorite smell when I'm out on a walk, it's gotta be a tie between when, you know, a really great girlie walks by you and you can get a good ol' whiff of her hair and her perfume, as well as the smell of tires.

00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:27.083
They smell very similar in a way.

00:25:27.103 --> 00:25:29.884
Both sweet, both fluffy,

00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:35.062
It helps that I can stay well hidden and fly at the same time.

00:25:38.763 --> 00:25:41.944
Well, I guess that's it for these silly corners, huh?

00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:44.545
What the fluff?

00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:45.966
They drag on so much!

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:49.787
Are you sure you want to submit things like this to the show, Ruffians?

00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:52.788
I'll never understand you.

00:25:54.889 --> 00:25:57.950
Well, for the next stream that FUWAMOCO has,

00:26:01.522 --> 00:26:11.049
I'm forcing them to get some rest for now, but after that, they're going back in time to the Showa period in Japan in Holococoon.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:20.196
Us demon dogs, you know, we've been around for a long time, but I think FUWAMOCO wants to explore the Showa period with you, okay?

00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:23.678
You better hold their paws because it might be rough.

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:25.519
Got it, Ruffrians?

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.482
I'm depending on you, we're buddies now.

00:26:30.032 --> 00:26:32.833
And their schedule looks something like this.

00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:36.235
Yeah, you seen it?

00:26:36.896 --> 00:26:39.257
Well, I'm gonna explain it for you again, okay?

00:26:39.797 --> 00:26:40.397
Friday.

00:26:40.918 --> 00:26:44.279
Now Friday's special has something cool.

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:46.040
An announcement.

00:26:46.841 --> 00:26:47.621
Announcement.

00:26:48.101 --> 00:26:51.783
Well, since we're buddies now, huh?

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:57.926
I'll let you know right now just what that announcement is, right?

00:26:58.626 --> 00:26:59.427
You like that?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.860
Huh?

00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:05.961
Would you like that?

00:27:07.361 --> 00:27:13.123
So, all of Advent is **** and also ****.

00:27:17.644 --> 00:27:21.805
So yeah, you can thank the Great Peron for all of that.

00:27:22.505 --> 00:27:24.505
You heard it first hand!

00:27:25.485 --> 00:27:25.585
Well,

00:27:29.645 --> 00:27:39.972
I guess I have to say a good thank you for joining me for the latest episode of FUWAMOCO Morning this week.

00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:47.617
This is a bit embarrassing, but I guess I should do this to high.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:53.901
Don't be too happy if I read out your name or anything, okay, Ruffians?

00:27:58.364 --> 00:27:59.185
Orange juice!

00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:01.225
Rowan.

00:28:03.206 --> 00:28:04.006
Lucas.

00:28:06.428 --> 00:28:07.349
Nobear.

00:28:10.871 --> 00:28:11.672
Toyon.

00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:12.732
Have a good day.

00:28:14.073 --> 00:28:15.114
MWK.

00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:16.655
Have a good day.

00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:18.356
Kikito.

00:28:18.877 --> 00:28:20.178
Have a good day.

00:28:21.238 --> 00:28:21.538
Lim.

00:28:22.699 --> 00:28:23.860
Have a good day.

00:28:25.061 --> 00:28:25.561
Got it.

00:28:27.022 --> 00:28:29.324
And to all the other Ruffians out there.

00:28:31.581 --> 00:28:32.342
I hope you're good.

00:28:33.744 --> 00:28:36.487
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:37.448 --> 00:28:39.110
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:28:41.313 --> 00:28:42.334
Later, Ruffians!
