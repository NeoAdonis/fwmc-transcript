05:31.066 --> 05:33.710
Where was I supposed to say that again, FUWAMOCO-chan?

05:33.730 --> 05:37.294
We're your hosts, all FUWAMOCO related!

05:37.314 --> 05:37.855

I love hibernation!

06:05.490 --> 06:05.650
BAU BAU!

06:06.552 --> 06:12.904
How many Ruffians is this your first FUWAMOCO Morning?

06:12.924 --> 06:14.588
Moco-chan's glasses now!

06:14.788 --> 06:18.996
Better to bring the morning one, right?

06:18.976 --> 06:22.641
I see an important question, but what is FUWAMOCO Morning?

06:23.402 --> 06:30.592
I'm glad you asked because I was just about to explain it for those that are joining us for the first time!

06:30.652 --> 06:32.875
Yeah, today we just want to cheer you on.

06:33.315 --> 06:40.024
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:40.044 --> 06:40.705
A.K.A.

06:40.725 --> 06:40.905
FUWAMOCO!

06:40.926 --> 06:42.047
It's hosted by us,

06:42.027 --> 06:43.630
FUWAMOCO!

06:44.231 --> 06:49.499
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:49.519 --> 06:49.679
Yes.

06:50.300 --> 06:56.490
Now, let's please tweet your thoughts, maybe right now, with the hashtag.

06:57.051 --> 06:57.432
Hashtag.

06:57.632 --> 06:58.353
FWMCMORNING!

06:58.794 --> 07:02.881
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

07:03.321 --> 07:04.423
BAU BAU!

07:05.062 --> 07:07.946
BAU BAU!

07:08.006 --> 07:14.274
Thank you Abyss for joining us!

07:14.435 --> 07:15.196
We're back!

07:15.236 --> 07:17.379
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

07:17.399 --> 07:20.002
Let's make this the best week you know!

07:20.443 --> 07:22.445
BAU BAU!

07:23.667 --> 07:26.751
Well Moco-chan, you know a lot's been going on.

07:28.193 --> 07:31.137
What do we have first today?

07:33.023 --> 07:36.388
Did you want the good news or the bad news, Ruffians?

07:37.189 --> 07:38.391
The good news, you know!

07:38.671 --> 07:39.252
Bass!

07:39.272 --> 07:40.013
X-Bowl!

07:40.033 --> 07:45.742
Big announcement!

07:45.762 --> 07:47.484
Bad news!

07:47.645 --> 07:48.426
Good news!

07:49.267 --> 07:49.888
Bad news!

07:49.928 --> 07:51.230
Bad news first!

07:51.250 --> 07:56.538
You're getting the bad news first.

07:57.379 --> 07:59.382
That's what I'm asking for, Moco-chan.

07:59.502 --> 08:00.664
I saw good news.

08:00.724 --> 08:02.727
You're getting the bad news.

08:03.618 --> 08:04.859
Well, Moco-chan.

08:07.942 --> 08:08.943
It's been a while.

08:08.963 --> 08:10.745
We had a good run.

08:10.765 --> 08:16.290
But... There's been another Pero sighting.

08:16.310 --> 08:20.795
BAU BAU!

08:20.815 --> 08:22.396
Ruffians, are you okay?

08:22.416 --> 08:23.718
Did you have a bad sleep?

08:23.738 --> 08:26.020
Was the pillow really hard or something?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.341
The hibernation wasn't so great.

08:27.862 --> 08:29.503
It's a waste of a hibernation.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.287
Well, Moco-chan, let's see where Pero was spotted.

08:34.111 --> 08:38.719
Well, we have... De-den!

08:40.702 --> 08:41.704
Wait, what?

08:42.705 --> 08:45.149
What?

08:45.229 --> 08:48.815
Pero's looking... Eggs are fluffy now.

08:49.036 --> 08:52.662
Maybe the hibernation, you know, kicked in and sort of bundled up.

08:52.682 --> 09:00.034
Yeah, I'm not so tooty, but... It seems like he was pretty nasty to you there, hey?

09:00.689 --> 09:05.852
You know, if he's nasty, we nasty him back!

09:06.294 --> 09:07.600
Got it?

09:07.721 --> 09:10.513
Maybe the color of the scarf on him?

09:10.983 --> 09:13.488
It does sort of look pretty nice.

09:13.508 --> 09:13.748
It does.

09:13.768 --> 09:16.093
Especially with the leaves, you know, they sort of blend together.

09:16.253 --> 09:19.360
Yeah, but... But you know, it's such a nice scarf, you know?

09:19.380 --> 09:20.903
Maybe... Stylish, nasty, yeah.

09:20.943 --> 09:27.215
Maybe you could wear it instead, or... You know, we would love to wear that scarf, right, Moco-chan?

09:27.235 --> 09:27.335
Yeah!

09:27.355 --> 09:27.576
Oh, right.

09:27.936 --> 09:31.303
I think we'd appreciate it more than him.

09:31.283 --> 09:32.565
Oh, you think you know?

09:32.585 --> 09:35.791
Oh, the scarf is gonna make him fly better if you kick him!

09:37.033 --> 09:37.274
Maybe.

09:37.294 --> 09:41.562
I don't know if aerodynamics works that way, but you can always give it a try, Ruffian!

09:41.782 --> 09:43.705
It's sort of frightful though, you know?

09:44.607 --> 09:44.908
Before.

09:44.928 --> 09:47.352
2D now.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.931
That's what hibernation does to Pero, huh?

09:53.132 --> 09:56.295
Got really sort of big.

09:56.776 --> 10:04.165
Ruffians even though I know we're talking about aerodynamics and everything, but it's good that you're so kind and gentle, right?

10:04.185 --> 10:06.488
Giving Pero a scarf when he really doesn't need it.

10:06.508 --> 10:08.310
You should just take it for yourself and rip it off.

10:08.330 --> 10:11.854
BAU BAU!

10:11.834 --> 10:14.777
Ruffians!

10:14.797 --> 10:19.341
You know, it's been a little while since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

10:20.061 --> 10:24.125
But now, we're back!

10:24.145 --> 10:24.645
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

10:24.786 --> 10:25.246
Official!

10:25.766 --> 10:28.129
FUWAMOCO, we didn't go anywhere, you know.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.111
And maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, huh?

10:31.131 --> 10:31.211
Huh?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.372
What's this hibernation?

10:32.432 --> 10:33.253
I didn't hear about this.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.836
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning back in the end of... The beginning?

10:36.896 --> 10:37.877
The beginning of October?

10:37.897 --> 10:39.799
The end of October, two weeks ago.

10:39.779 --> 10:41.141
Yeah.

10:41.661 --> 10:51.974
It went on hibernation so that FUWAMOCO, you know, that we could focus on, you know, all the exciting things that we've done within the past few months!

10:51.994 --> 10:55.678
And we realized maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, I missed it.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.020
Oh, well, I was kind of busy.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.943
I had some hibernation duties for myself.

10:59.983 --> 11:01.485
Yeah.

11:01.745 --> 11:08.273
We thought we'd bring you up to speed what's been going on in the world of FUWAMOCO and a little bit of hololive as well.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.735
This is what we remember right now.

11:10.576 --> 11:12.238
It might be incomplete.

11:12.258 --> 11:15.581
It'll be filled up.

11:15.601 --> 11:17.343
Let us know what we're missing, FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

11:17.824 --> 11:20.386
Since the last FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:20.566 --> 11:22.869
FUWAMOCO Morning episode 140!

11:24.911 --> 11:28.635
Well, to start off the series of good news, there's some really horrible news.

11:29.796 --> 11:35.742
FUWAMOCO's favorite place in the world, Akihabara Misuto, closed after 52 years.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.444
Yeah.

11:38.335 --> 11:44.286
Happy Flashback Day!

11:44.587 --> 11:45.148
Bye!

11:48.073 --> 11:49.395
Wow!

11:49.416 --> 11:54.505
You know, now it's not just hololive device.

11:54.685 --> 11:59.955
There's also new kouhai device, Flow Glow!

11:59.935 --> 12:05.281
You know, we got some new kouhai and they're ready to do some rapping.

12:06.923 --> 12:08.164
Stylish rap.

12:08.484 --> 12:13.450
And then FUWAMOCO, you know, Ruffians!

12:13.470 --> 12:19.997
Thanks to you, FUWAMOCO somehow, we are named VTuber of the Year for 2024.

12:20.378 --> 12:25.183
BAU BAU!

12:25.163 --> 12:45.067
And then, FUWAMOCO, we also got a 3D Christmas event along with the other numbers of our English.

12:45.187 --> 12:46.749
Reindeer.

12:46.769 --> 12:46.930
Snowman.

12:47.170 --> 12:47.290
Santa.

12:47.270 --> 12:56.305
Um, there was also a little bit of a bittersweet departure saying goodbye to Fauna-senpai.

12:58.789 --> 13:00.111
But we report all the news.

13:00.933 --> 13:02.856
Report all the news, yeah.

13:03.557 --> 13:09.447
But, uh, well, I did.

13:10.169 --> 13:14.593
I was crowned the king of Janken in hololive.

13:14.613 --> 13:14.913
Yes!

13:15.294 --> 13:16.995
So that's pretty impressive, okay?

13:17.015 --> 13:17.896
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky!

13:17.916 --> 13:20.238
You feel like the luck is still following you?

13:20.839 --> 13:21.620
I do, actually.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.140
I really do.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.863
There was a time recently that I was like, this is because I'm super lucky this year.

13:25.883 --> 13:27.785
It hasn't ended, Ruffians.

13:28.366 --> 13:37.394
That's why, oh... That's how the keys flew off the keyboard, because we were lucky.

13:37.414 --> 13:37.514
Yeah.

13:37.534 --> 13:38.455
It comes and goes.

13:38.857 --> 13:46.469
I'm the strongest of Rock, Paper, Scissors and all of us!

13:46.830 --> 13:47.430
Advent!

13:48.031 --> 13:50.676
We got brand new outfits!

13:50.896 --> 13:52.318
Casual outfits!

13:52.338 --> 13:53.059
Out in a boat!

13:53.180 --> 13:54.562
Out in a boat!

13:54.582 --> 13:56.144
That's us!

13:56.164 --> 14:01.152
You know, so today, you know, I really want to put my casual dress down for the Ruffians.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.565
Do you know that that's the official name of these outfits for us?

14:04.907 --> 14:05.890
For FUWAMOCO.

14:06.533 --> 14:08.300
It's our out in a boat outfit.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.669
Yeah, out in a boat outfit.

14:10.953 --> 14:15.539
You know that FUWAMOCO fans didn't know.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.482
FUWAMOCO fashion fans.

14:20.545 --> 14:23.348
And also big news!

14:23.368 --> 14:28.734
We had our very first birthday live!

14:28.754 --> 14:30.897
Our first mini birthday concert!

14:30.917 --> 14:33.400
We worked so so hard!

14:33.380 --> 14:35.823
We know we sung with our senpai!

14:36.023 --> 14:38.566
We danced together with Advent too!

14:38.586 --> 14:45.594
So if you haven't checked out our birthday concert... It's not a request, it's a need.

14:45.614 --> 14:50.840
And if you already checked it out, then you gotta check it out again.

14:50.861 --> 14:51.822
More news!

14:52.122 --> 14:53.003
FUWAMOCO!

14:53.444 --> 14:57.048
We sent Biboo to the Shadow Realm in Yu-Gi-Oh!

14:57.068 --> 15:01.513
Possibly the most important news out of all of us.

15:01.493 --> 15:03.155
You know what?

15:03.175 --> 15:05.637
When we did an official tournament!

15:05.657 --> 15:06.138
Yeah!

15:06.178 --> 15:07.379
Yu-Gi-Oh Masters!

15:07.519 --> 15:09.321
And we sent Biboo to the Shadow Realm somehow.

15:09.641 --> 15:10.442
I'm not too sure.

15:10.722 --> 15:10.983
Yeah.

15:11.003 --> 15:12.544
Thanks to the Ruffians.

15:13.625 --> 15:13.786
Yeah.

15:13.886 --> 15:14.867
And the Heart of the Cards.

15:15.327 --> 15:17.089
And the Heart of the Cards, yeah.

15:18.030 --> 15:22.514
And then most recently, as in, well, yesterday?

15:22.534 --> 15:24.016
Two days ago?

15:24.036 --> 15:25.778
Depends on your time zone.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.720
Wow!

15:27.740 --> 15:29.241
hololive Expo!

15:29.261 --> 15:29.982
hololive...

15:30.670 --> 15:31.912
That's it.

15:31.952 --> 15:33.735
That's it.

15:33.755 --> 15:33.955
That's it.

15:33.975 --> 15:34.777
That's it.

15:34.797 --> 15:35.798
That's it.

15:35.818 --> 15:36.399
That's it.

15:36.419 --> 15:37.461
That's it.

15:37.481 --> 15:37.741
That's it.

15:37.762 --> 15:37.982
That's it.

15:38.002 --> 15:38.202
That's it.

15:38.763 --> 15:39.044
That's it.

15:39.064 --> 15:39.444
That's it.

15:39.464 --> 15:40.025
That's it.

15:40.045 --> 15:40.246
That's it.

15:40.266 --> 15:40.466
That's it.

15:40.486 --> 15:40.686
That's it.

15:40.706 --> 15:41.648
That's it.

15:41.668 --> 15:41.868
That's it.

15:41.888 --> 15:42.449
That's it.

15:42.469 --> 15:42.670
That's it.

15:42.870 --> 15:43.932
That's it.

15:43.952 --> 15:44.833
That's it.

15:44.993 --> 15:45.294
That's it.

15:45.314 --> 15:45.614
That's it.

15:45.634 --> 15:46.215
That's it.

15:46.295 --> 15:47.517
That's it.

15:47.537 --> 15:47.838
That's it.

15:47.858 --> 15:48.259
That's it.

15:48.299 --> 15:48.559
That's it.

15:48.579 --> 15:48.840
That's it.

15:48.860 --> 15:49.060
That's it.

15:49.080 --> 15:49.501
That's it.

15:49.521 --> 15:49.781
That's it.

15:49.801 --> 15:50.262
That's it.

15:50.322 --> 15:50.522
That's it.

15:50.542 --> 15:50.743
That's it.

15:50.763 --> 15:51.304
That's it.

15:51.324 --> 15:51.524
That's it.

15:51.544 --> 15:51.804
That's it.

15:51.905 --> 15:52.225
That's it.

15:52.245 --> 15:52.646
That's it.

15:52.706 --> 15:52.966
That's it.

15:52.986 --> 15:53.247
That's it.

15:53.267 --> 15:53.507
That's it.

15:53.527 --> 15:53.727
That's it.

15:53.748 --> 15:54.028
That's it.

15:54.048 --> 15:54.248
That's it.

15:54.268 --> 15:54.709
That's it.

15:54.729 --> 15:54.970
That's it.

15:54.990 --> 15:55.190
That's it.

15:55.210 --> 15:55.430
That's it.

15:55.450 --> 15:55.731
That's it.

15:55.751 --> 15:56.472
That's it.

15:56.492 --> 15:56.692
That's it.

15:56.712 --> 15:56.913
That's it.

15:56.933 --> 15:57.133
That's it.

15:57.113 --> 15:58.636
That was a pretty good rundown.

15:58.676 --> 16:00.560
Pretty good.

16:00.600 --> 16:00.781
I'm glad.

16:00.801 --> 16:01.161
Very late.

16:02.564 --> 16:03.045
Yeah.

16:03.146 --> 16:05.009
Of course there's a lot of other things.

16:05.029 --> 16:06.693
Valentine's, Christmas, of course!

16:07.575 --> 16:10.180
There's a new hololive minecraft server.

16:10.340 --> 16:10.421
Yes!

16:10.441 --> 16:13.226
New hololive minecraft server also is out as well!

16:14.289 --> 16:16.694
Very important one.

16:16.794 --> 16:16.894
Yeah.

16:17.313 --> 16:36.233
FUWAMOCO Morning will have more amazing things to share soon with you!

16:37.580 --> 16:48.480
So we hope that you join us for FUWAMOCO Morning on Fridays, Wednesdays and Mondays right here on L2!

16:48.500 --> 16:48.961
BAU BAU!

16:48.981 --> 16:52.027
And for more exciting updates!

16:52.047 --> 16:54.572
Oh wow!

16:54.592 --> 16:55.774
Ruffians!

16:56.142 --> 17:07.742
Like we mentioned, it was actually the 5th, 6th, 5th weekend!

17:07.762 --> 17:08.182
6th Fest at FUWAMOCO!

17:08.202 --> 17:09.024
We had our first ever Fest Appearance!

17:09.044 --> 17:09.404
Color Rise Harmony!

17:10.045 --> 17:13.692
At FUWAMOCO we appeared on Day 1 Stage 1!

17:13.712 --> 17:19.021
Our debut stage together with all of Advent!

17:19.041 --> 17:19.281
At FUWAMOCO!

17:19.261 --> 17:25.369
Of course we performed our original song Born to be BAUDOL!

17:25.389 --> 17:28.353
And Ruffians shook the entire venue!

17:28.373 --> 17:33.620
All of Makuhari-mensei with your big bau bau's and your cola's.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.182
You can feel it in your body, in your bones.

17:35.202 --> 17:36.844
It's just reverberating.

17:36.864 --> 17:39.327
Yeah, I'm a heck yeah.

17:39.347 --> 17:39.728
Heck yeah!

17:41.190 --> 17:41.370
Yattaiga!

17:41.350 --> 17:45.134
But not just BAU, we also have a song!

17:45.515 --> 17:47.337
Yakko no Hugo!

17:47.697 --> 17:50.861
It's an anime song from the anime Super U!

17:50.941 --> 17:54.846
It's a really really special song to us, a song that we've always struggled with singing.

17:54.866 --> 18:00.692
There's lots of harmonies, cool choreography, and the lyrics really really resonate with us too!

18:00.712 --> 18:03.055
Yeah, and maybe there's a high kick.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.005
That was much higher than it was ever supposed to be.

18:06.025 --> 18:08.150
Very much fueled by adrenaline.

18:09.332 --> 18:14.042
And very sore the next day.

18:14.143 --> 18:15.185
But!

18:15.546 --> 18:18.552
We also got all together with all of Advent.

18:19.334 --> 18:20.917
And I think we started a fire.

18:21.539 --> 18:24.064
Because we saw rebellion.

18:25.917 --> 18:30.745
FUWAMOCO Morning!

18:30.765 --> 18:37.976
Ruffians, if you haven't been able to catch up on all the exciting things that happen at SixFest, please head over to SBW and Spawn.

18:38.236 --> 18:40.320
You can get your streaming tickets right now.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.526
There's an archive and it'll be available for one month.

18:44.546 --> 18:46.048
So please check it out while you can.

18:46.389 --> 18:49.774
A very, very special debut stage at best.

18:49.975 --> 18:52.178
And of course, we're also part of the

18:52.158 --> 18:53.019
What is it?

18:53.039 --> 18:53.679
Rensai-kyoku?

18:53.719 --> 18:55.862
Yeah, the group songs as well.

18:55.882 --> 19:00.266
And then, on day two, we are part of the creator stage.

19:00.286 --> 19:03.789
We performed together with Nenechi, her song.

19:04.069 --> 19:07.573
Girafa Nenechi's Giragira Family.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.674
Girafa!

19:08.894 --> 19:13.158
It's a very cute, very silly song, very jumpy song.

19:13.759 --> 19:18.503
So we hope that you'll also check that out as well if you haven't.

19:18.483 --> 19:19.765
It was a lot of fun!

19:20.606 --> 19:30.521
Being able to hear your BAU BAUs, see your panelists, see your smiles, and maybe a few tears here and there, Ruffians!

19:31.022 --> 19:33.005
It meant the world to us!

19:33.105 --> 19:34.347
Thank you so much!

19:34.367 --> 19:38.753
We also had a very silly and maybe too energetic MV with Koyori-senpai!

19:38.733 --> 19:40.956
So please don't miss it!

19:40.976 --> 19:52.270
You know, if you're curious about FES, you've never seen FES, but you don't really know, there is a free sneak peek as well on the official hololive JP channel, so please check it out!

19:52.290 --> 19:56.936
You need to check it out, there's some amazing performances there!

19:56.956 --> 20:01.601
Yeah, but if you want to see FUWAMOCO, we definitely recommend Stage 1!

20:01.782 --> 20:04.205
Get your stream ticket or camera free!

20:04.886 --> 20:06.107
BAU BAU!

20:06.087 --> 20:09.397
Comment in a box?

20:09.577 --> 20:18.443
That's a sight to be seen.

20:18.862 --> 20:22.107
BAU BAU!

20:22.127 --> 20:26.794
And not only was it Fes, but it was also Expo!

20:27.636 --> 20:29.178
The big hololive Expo!

20:29.258 --> 20:30.159
Super Expo!

20:30.380 --> 20:32.163
Expo is a little bit different from Fes.

20:32.183 --> 20:35.989
Fes is where, you know, you go on singing, the dancing, the concert.

20:36.089 --> 20:40.836
Expo is the convention part where you have a bunch of fun things to do.

20:40.816 --> 20:51.554
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.428
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:00.408 --> 21:03.252
We were not expecting that at all.

21:03.933 --> 21:04.514
We were not expecting them!

21:05.175 --> 21:06.117
Yeah!

21:06.137 --> 21:09.041
You know we got the first flip set, FUWAMOCO Arnando words, which are in production right now!

21:09.061 --> 21:09.642
They're cute!

21:09.662 --> 21:10.002
Aren't they cute?

21:10.022 --> 21:10.363
Aren't they cute?

21:10.383 --> 21:10.783
Aren't they cute?

21:10.984 --> 21:11.665
Aren't they cute?

21:11.725 --> 21:12.186
Aren't they cute?

21:12.206 --> 21:12.626
Aren't they cute?

21:12.646 --> 21:13.167
Aren't they cute?

21:13.187 --> 21:13.788
Aren't they cute?

21:13.808 --> 21:14.149
Aren't they cute?

21:14.169 --> 21:14.509
Aren't they cute?

21:14.529 --> 21:14.870
Aren't they cute?

21:14.890 --> 21:15.230
Aren't they cute?

21:15.250 --> 21:15.591
Aren't they cute?

21:15.611 --> 21:15.951
Aren't they cute?

21:15.971 --> 21:16.312
Aren't they cute?

21:16.332 --> 21:16.672
Aren't they cute?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.033
Aren't they cute?

21:17.053 --> 21:18.175
Aren't they cute?

21:18.195 --> 21:18.535
Aren't they cute?

21:18.555 --> 21:18.976
Aren't they cute?

21:18.996 --> 21:19.376
Aren't they cute?

21:19.396 --> 21:19.737
Aren't they cute?

21:19.837 --> 21:20.177
Aren't they cute?

21:20.198 --> 21:20.738
Aren't they cute?

21:20.758 --> 21:21.419
Aren't they cute?

21:21.439 --> 21:21.960
Aren't they cute?

21:22.020 --> 21:22.361
Aren't they cute?

21:22.381 --> 21:22.942
Aren't they cute?

21:22.962 --> 21:23.462
Aren't they cute?

21:23.502 --> 21:24.003
Aren't they cute?

21:24.023 --> 21:24.384
Aren't they cute?

21:24.404 --> 21:24.905
Aren't they cute?

21:24.925 --> 21:25.285
Aren't they cute?

21:25.305 --> 21:25.646
Aren't they cute?

21:25.666 --> 21:26.467
Aren't they cute?

21:26.487 --> 21:26.567
Aren

21:26.547 --> 21:28.812
Ruffians!

21:28.973 --> 21:32.601
I made it brighter for you.

21:33.262 --> 21:35.688
It's a production.

21:35.888 --> 21:41.260
Moco-chan took the photo, so don't blame me.

21:41.902 --> 21:43.746
It was a group effort.

21:44.232 --> 21:48.158
Yeah, just like everything else.

21:48.178 --> 21:48.279
Yeah!

21:48.299 --> 21:49.821
You adopted us!

21:49.841 --> 21:49.941
Yeah!

21:49.961 --> 21:50.182
BAU BAU!

21:50.202 --> 21:53.407
And not only was our nendor is there, but also!

21:55.350 --> 21:55.510
De-den!

21:55.611 --> 21:59.196
BAU BAU PUPPY!

21:59.216 --> 21:59.317
Yeah!

21:59.337 --> 21:59.537
It's over!

21:59.557 --> 21:59.717
BAU BAU!

21:59.737 --> 22:01.901
These aren't finished either, there's no color rule.

22:02.322 --> 22:02.943
But!

22:03.303 --> 22:04.505
They're in production.

22:04.665 --> 22:06.408
Look at Moco-chan's tummy!

22:06.649 --> 22:07.490
Oh my gosh.

22:07.911 --> 22:08.772
I guess.

22:08.752 --> 22:17.152
Moco-chan, you realize once I get my paws on these, I'm gonna have to touch this Moco-chan's tummy and then touch the real tummy.

22:17.593 --> 22:23.628
I'm just saying it is a figure so I can't look pretty closely, huh?

22:23.648 --> 22:25.292
But you can't touch, right Moco-chan?

22:26.065 --> 22:28.289
How else are you going to pick up the figures?

22:28.309 --> 22:29.832
I'm from the base, you know.

22:30.653 --> 22:31.575
Don't touch the lights.

22:32.156 --> 22:35.242
When you pick up a figure, you grab it by the leg and go, what?

22:35.402 --> 22:37.786
What kind of way are you picking up figures, Moco-chan?

22:38.828 --> 22:38.908
Huh?

22:38.928 --> 22:43.436
Normal way.

22:43.456 --> 22:45.660
But please look forward to the dolphins just like the nendoroids.

22:45.701 --> 22:47.043
They are in production.

22:47.063 --> 22:49.828
You cannot adopt them yet, but prepare to adopt them.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.784
Maybe some.

22:52.285 --> 22:52.947
BAU BAU.

22:53.268 --> 22:58.560
But you know, I think Ruffians, I think from your reactions, you kind of like figures, right?

22:58.741 --> 22:59.222
Right.

22:59.242 --> 23:00.465
Well, we have good news.

23:00.485 --> 23:08.644
We have good news because hololive English -Advent-, we're having a pop-up shop!

23:08.624 --> 23:14.191
It's gonna be starting from April 25th at the Shibuya Tsutaya.

23:14.532 --> 23:16.374
It's right at Shibuya Scramble.

23:16.394 --> 23:22.923
Right at the famous Shibuya Scramble, we're gonna be having a very special pop-up shop just for Advent.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.687
And it was also announced FUWAMOCO.

23:25.707 --> 23:32.837
There's gonna be brand new FUWAMOCO figures one size and scale with an original, a brand original outfit.

23:32.857 --> 23:36.201
There's a catch, something's a little bit different.

23:37.109 --> 23:40.914
What kind of outfits is the brand original?

23:41.074 --> 23:41.855
What brand is this?

23:41.995 --> 23:43.538
I don't... Have you seen?

23:43.638 --> 23:46.662
Maybe you can check it out.

23:46.682 --> 23:47.503
What kind of outfit could it be?

23:47.523 --> 23:48.104
Bead outfits?

23:48.124 --> 23:51.168
I know there's bathing suits, bikinis.

23:51.268 --> 23:53.711
Bathing suits before.

23:53.731 --> 23:56.314
You know it is in Shibuya, right?

23:56.334 --> 23:56.715
I know.

23:56.915 --> 23:58.437
Shibuya fashion.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.162
Goodbye wallet.

24:04.685 --> 24:05.867
Hi Ruffians.

24:06.708 --> 24:10.617
Maybe, you know, maybe you'll find a new wallet at this pop-up shop, right?

24:10.858 --> 24:12.662
Maybe, who knows what they could have!

24:12.802 --> 24:19.277
I have a feeling that wallet might be pretty empty and it might do a good job at even emptying your existing wallet.

24:19.297 --> 24:19.979
I'm sorry!

24:19.999 --> 24:20.199
BAU BAU!

24:20.219 --> 24:24.970
This is how things work, though.

24:24.950 --> 24:33.664
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

24:34.565 --> 24:42.959
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

24:45.142 --> 24:51.733
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

24:52.642 --> 24:59.210
Enjoy hololive songs in THE FIRST OFFICIAL MOBILE GAME!

24:59.250 --> 25:00.091
That's exactly what it says.

25:00.111 --> 25:06.579
It has to be here with that project called DREAMS!

25:06.599 --> 25:08.762
Just like that movie!

25:08.982 --> 25:12.807
And look, it's gonna be a simultaneous worldwide release!

25:13.568 --> 25:17.232
It's available in some regions.

25:17.667 --> 25:18.868
That's what it says!

25:18.888 --> 25:20.070
What kind of game is it?

25:20.090 --> 25:20.650
A mobile game?

25:20.670 --> 25:21.892
That's what we do know.

25:21.912 --> 25:23.333
We do not know much about it.

25:23.393 --> 25:26.036
Enjoy hololive songs in official mobile games.

25:26.837 --> 25:27.518
That's what we know.

25:27.538 --> 25:28.258
That's what we know.

25:28.939 --> 25:32.143
But FUWAMOCO we know a little bit more.

25:32.163 --> 25:33.284
Moco-chan!

25:33.724 --> 25:35.626
You had some fun playing.

25:35.646 --> 25:35.967
I did.

25:35.987 --> 25:36.287
I did.

25:36.307 --> 25:38.810
I did have a little bit of fun.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.251
And I thought it was very fun.

25:40.271 --> 25:42.474
And you're laughing pretty hard too, huh?

25:44.436 --> 25:46.598
Laughing pretty hard!

25:46.618 --> 25:47.539
Apparently I'm pretty good at it.

25:47.924 --> 25:49.466
Yeah, you got praised, huh?

25:49.606 --> 25:49.966
I did.

25:51.788 --> 25:57.794
So please look forward to it, Ruffians!

25:58.355 --> 26:04.061
It's gonna be so much fun!

26:04.782 --> 26:05.843
So much excitement!

26:06.043 --> 26:08.085
It's a game, and it's pretty fun.

26:08.626 --> 26:12.970
Enjoy the hololive songs in a mobile game.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.565
BAU BAU!

26:15.585 --> 26:17.087
This game is gonna go big!

26:17.107 --> 26:18.610
It's exciting!

26:18.690 --> 26:19.591
It's exciting!

26:20.293 --> 26:22.877
Let's have a lot of fun with the mofians!

26:22.897 --> 26:23.618
You played it!

26:23.638 --> 26:27.284
I thought you didn't.

26:28.506 --> 26:33.675
But you know, at FUWAMOCO we are hololive and it's a hololive game.

26:34.516 --> 26:36.200
Mobile game to be more accurate.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.169
Official mobile game to be most accurate!

26:40.189 --> 26:42.915
Can you say the title again?

26:42.955 --> 26:45.741
Project Code 3.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.141
That's how it goes.

26:49.902 --> 26:52.966
I want to know if that's the title, but... Right!

26:53.086 --> 26:53.506
Right!

26:55.148 --> 26:56.550
For now, that's what we're gonna call it.

26:57.031 --> 27:06.282
But please look forward to it, Ruffians, and make sure that you have lots of fun playing it once it comes out to PVDs.

27:06.302 --> 27:08.645
BAU BAU!

27:10.347 --> 27:12.690
Ruffians, you know it.

27:13.143 --> 27:17.610
Do we have a picture for this?

27:17.630 --> 27:18.331
For what?

27:18.351 --> 27:25.080
Well, FUWAMOCO, you know, X-Bowl, everybody had a bunch of fun around the venue.

27:26.242 --> 27:30.849
FUWAMOCO, we got to go to X-Bowl a little bit early.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.653
We are unleashed with some pens.

27:34.074 --> 27:36.377
And we got to climb all over the place.

27:36.397 --> 27:39.201
The floor, the walls, almost anything and everything.

27:39.181 --> 27:55.789
Fuwawa also did something a little bit embarrassing.

27:56.461 --> 28:07.134
Uh, you know, um, FUWAMOCO, sometimes things happen, and, um, Moco-chan, kind of, you went on ahead without me.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.196
Why do you make it sound like I did something wrong?

28:09.717 --> 28:09.897
You did!

28:09.917 --> 28:11.499
You went on ahead without me!

28:12.060 --> 28:13.842
And then I couldn't find Moco-chan!

28:14.923 --> 28:19.769
So I was running around looking for Moco-chan, when MOCO-CHAAAAN!

28:20.650 --> 28:23.093
I'm reverberating around the hall.

28:24.423 --> 28:31.232
And... Well, I don't realize it until it's too late, but... I ran past YAGOO-san!

28:32.834 --> 28:37.240
And... You know, YAGOO-san sure was gonna be like, Oh!

28:37.881 --> 28:39.964
Oh, it's nice to see you, Fuwawa!

28:39.984 --> 28:42.227
But you left.

28:42.247 --> 28:43.008
But I didn't see him.

28:43.028 --> 28:43.489
I snubbed him.

28:43.509 --> 28:44.390
I snubbed YAGOO-san.

28:45.091 --> 28:45.772
Yeah.

28:45.812 --> 28:47.194
But I found Moco-chan!

28:47.935 --> 28:48.315
Yeah.

28:48.976 --> 28:51.780
I should've just made her go back on her own.

28:52.351 --> 28:55.076
I was dying!

28:55.096 --> 28:56.599
Did you say good morning?

28:56.619 --> 28:58.744
Say hi to YAGOOo-san!

28:59.625 --> 29:01.349
I ran back with her.

29:02.451 --> 29:08.603
We apologized and said OHAYO GOZAIMASU!

29:08.623 --> 29:09.685
And then we ran off.

29:11.268 --> 29:24.648
But YAGOOo-san was nice and we also got YAGOOo-san to sign our FUWAMOCO edible posters too!

29:26.311 --> 29:28.454
We should maybe post a photo, right?

29:28.574 --> 29:30.998
We have a lot of photos to post.

29:30.978 --> 29:35.847
FUWAMOCO Signature, yes!

29:36.669 --> 29:41.157
I guarantee you there's probably no other FUWAMOCO because it's signed by YAGOO-san.

29:41.458 --> 29:45.104
Only one's in existence!

29:46.908 --> 29:47.108
FUWAMOCO!

29:47.128 --> 29:47.709
Thank you YAGOO-san!

29:47.830 --> 29:49.172
I'm sure YAGOO-san wasn't gone.

29:49.692 --> 29:51.755
I'm FUWAMOCO Shiori.

29:53.217 --> 29:56.302
BAU BAU!

29:59.326 --> 30:00.107
Ruffians!

30:00.668 --> 30:01.489
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:01.509 --> 30:05.115
We're back with lots of exciting things!

30:05.135 --> 30:08.379
What's FUWAMOCO-chan?

30:08.399 --> 30:11.063
You made a sound that was kind of voice on there.

30:13.807 --> 30:16.932
You know...

30:20.168 --> 30:21.911
Ruffians!

30:25.295 --> 30:37.553
It happened again for the first time in forever, but it happened again!

30:38.512 --> 30:40.534
There's a misunderstanding, Ruffians.

30:40.595 --> 30:48.124
I don't know how I'm going to tell this to you, but... You know, FUWAMOCO Morning is back after the hibernation period.

30:48.144 --> 30:48.925
Yeah!

30:48.945 --> 30:51.248
And well... I think you're mistaken.

30:51.288 --> 30:52.429
You're misunderstood.

30:52.469 --> 30:56.854
Because FUWAMOCO Morning... We have not been gone for six months.

31:00.659 --> 31:00.759
Yeah.

31:00.779 --> 31:01.921
You know how long it's been?

31:03.823 --> 31:06.506
When was the last episode?

31:06.526 --> 31:07.928
It's been just a little bit.

31:08.836 --> 31:10.979
Four months, exactly.

31:11.079 --> 31:11.980
Four months.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.761
Four months!

31:13.462 --> 31:14.724
It's not six months!

31:14.744 --> 31:15.905
It's not seven months!

31:15.925 --> 31:17.588
It's not 84 years!

31:17.608 --> 31:18.409
Not ten months!

31:18.769 --> 31:20.672
It's only one third of the year!

31:20.692 --> 31:23.856
It hasn't been a half.

31:23.876 --> 31:24.216
Yeah.

31:25.498 --> 31:25.678
Right.

31:26.239 --> 31:26.399
Right.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.342
It feels like it's been an eternity.

31:28.362 --> 31:28.522
Right.

31:28.642 --> 31:29.403
I know.

31:29.423 --> 31:29.624
Right.

31:29.724 --> 31:32.127
When we said it was going on hibernation...

31:33.203 --> 31:42.319
Hibernation over then.

31:43.767 --> 31:54.100
And here we are again!

31:55.181 --> 32:08.678
Ready to start...

32:08.658 --> 32:18.192
Day off on the right paw three times a week.

32:18.212 --> 32:18.553
FUWAMOCO is back!

32:18.573 --> 32:19.014
We didn't go anywhere!

32:19.034 --> 32:19.615
We didn't go anywhere!

32:19.635 --> 32:25.584
We're just here now in the mornings together with your love fans.

32:25.604 --> 32:26.966
Not in this time zone.

32:28.067 --> 32:30.531
We're around in every time zone.

32:31.793 --> 32:35.558
If you stay up late or wake up early enough.

32:35.678 --> 32:35.838
Exactly!

32:35.858 --> 32:37.981
BAU BAU!

32:38.001 --> 32:39.142
No misunderstandings, okay?

32:39.162 --> 32:41.485
It hasn't been that long.

32:41.505 --> 32:43.508
What a good tears, Ruffians!

32:45.050 --> 32:45.931
We're back now.

32:46.211 --> 32:47.253
No more time for tears.

32:47.413 --> 32:50.637
BAU BAU!

32:50.877 --> 32:51.218
FUWAMOCO!

32:51.558 --> 32:55.523
Let's check out some of our regular corners!

32:55.503 --> 32:58.387
Starting with our Doggie of the Day.

32:58.407 --> 33:02.634
Let's check out see who our Doggie of the Day today is.

33:02.694 --> 33:11.427
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

33:11.447 --> 33:12.128
Today's Doggie of the Day is Cream!

33:12.149 --> 33:13.390
Cream, what a baby!

33:13.410 --> 33:14.652
Those ears!

33:14.672 --> 33:17.697
So cute, it's like a plush.

33:17.677 --> 33:26.145
Cream is a new addition to the family and is going to become the best buddy for the other doggy, Coffee!

33:26.305 --> 33:26.965
Coffee!

33:26.985 --> 33:28.206
Coffee and Cream!

33:28.287 --> 33:28.627
Coffee and Cream!

33:28.647 --> 33:30.529
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:30.549 --> 33:33.311
I need another addition to the family now.

33:33.331 --> 33:33.711
Who?

33:34.372 --> 33:34.913
Cookie.

33:35.493 --> 33:36.434
Cookie.

33:36.534 --> 33:37.795
What about Sugar?

33:37.815 --> 33:38.916
Coffee, Cream and Cookie!

33:38.936 --> 33:40.418
What about Sugar, Moco-chan?

33:40.558 --> 33:41.979
You may also need another one.

33:41.999 --> 33:42.299
Tea?

33:42.619 --> 33:42.960
Sugar?

33:42.980 --> 33:45.422
No, no tea or you have coffee!

33:46.972 --> 33:52.620
So in case you wanted more dogs, here's more names we've got.

33:53.321 --> 33:55.364
Next is Cookie, and then Sugar.

33:55.604 --> 33:57.607
What about Biscuit?

33:57.627 --> 33:58.609
No, you've got Cookie!

34:00.191 --> 34:03.336
Unless you like biscuits more than I do.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.200
Either or.

34:06.220 --> 34:13.350
But you know, Cream is still a little bit of a little tiny puppy here, but I'm still a coffee and cream dog.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.868
Perfect together in real time.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.990
Yeah, perfect pair.

34:18.911 --> 34:28.703
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Cream bow-bow?

34:29.504 --> 34:33.169
I think so, I think that's exactly it.

34:33.249 --> 34:35.452
I can hear Cream speaking to me.

34:37.114 --> 34:40.738
Yeah, that's exactly how Cream sounds, FUWAMOCO-chan.

34:41.950 --> 34:48.001
Yeah, well, you know, I think we can see here Cream, Cream still isn't quite sure of things, you know.

34:48.021 --> 34:48.602
That makes sense.

34:48.622 --> 34:55.174
A lot of new things going on, but that's okay because Cream's a cute baby.

34:55.194 --> 34:58.139
I will grow big and strong soon.

34:58.159 --> 35:00.263
You know what you do as a baby.

35:00.850 --> 35:03.232
Put on bright red lipstick.

35:03.252 --> 35:29.760
And then you go MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA MWA

35:29.740 --> 35:32.843
Let's take a look!

35:32.863 --> 35:34.684
Where did we go last?

35:34.825 --> 35:40.189
We have... De-den!

35:40.650 --> 35:43.793
Cherry blossoms!

35:43.813 --> 35:45.434
Pink like Moco-chan!

35:45.454 --> 35:46.595
She's such a bright pink!

35:47.136 --> 35:48.137
Am I blooming?

35:48.277 --> 35:49.618
The blue sky!

35:49.798 --> 35:53.181
Very FUWAMOCO season!

35:53.201 --> 35:53.642
FUWAMOCO season!

35:54.142 --> 35:55.463
Are you blooming Moco-chan?

35:55.483 --> 35:57.205
Am I blooming?

35:57.225 --> 35:59.747
Ruffians, what do you think?

35:59.727 --> 36:02.319
I'm always blooming!

36:02.801 --> 36:03.303
Yes!

36:03.946 --> 36:06.497
BAU BAU!

36:08.148 --> 36:13.334
But you know, spring is here, and so is FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:13.374 --> 36:15.697
Out of hibernation now.

36:16.418 --> 36:19.582
Forget about the snow after stage 2.

36:19.602 --> 36:27.491
But you know, everything's starting to warm up, so I think it's just about the perfect time for some more walks, right Ruffians?

36:28.232 --> 36:29.614
Time to go on a walk soon!

36:29.634 --> 36:35.421
Make sure you go and check out just what has changed during this hibernation period, you know?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.105
BAU BAU!

36:38.125 --> 36:39.887
Thank you for sharing your world with us!

36:40.388 --> 36:41.990
BAU BAU!

36:42.010 --> 36:44.534
And for the Question of the Day!

36:44.654 --> 36:48.740
Today's Question of the Day is... Dango!

36:49.060 --> 36:49.881
Oh simple.

36:49.901 --> 36:51.664
Simple like dango.

36:51.824 --> 36:52.385
Dango.

36:52.405 --> 36:53.126
BAU BAU.

36:53.146 --> 36:53.747
BAU BAU.

36:53.767 --> 36:54.508
What is dango?

36:54.528 --> 36:55.589
What is dango?

36:55.609 --> 36:58.253
Dango is a type of Japanese perfection.

36:58.233 --> 36:59.214
Sweet!

36:59.554 --> 37:04.540
Usually dango is like a sweet rice ball.

37:05.041 --> 37:08.124
But, you know, a dango, that's mochi, right?

37:08.224 --> 37:10.346
No, dango and mochi are different.

37:10.767 --> 37:16.373
You know, you make dango with shiratamako and mochiko.

37:16.613 --> 37:28.206
But it's mainly not mochiko, so it's more like a thicker, more ball-like consistency.

37:28.658 --> 37:30.060
Firmness to it.

37:30.701 --> 37:30.901
Made firm.

37:30.921 --> 37:32.444
And there's different type of dango.

37:32.464 --> 37:37.331
There's mitarashi dango, which is like a sweet soy sauce sauce you put on top.

37:37.591 --> 37:41.918
And then there's sanshoku dango, which is the emoji that you can see right now!

37:42.118 --> 37:42.940
Yeah, the hanami dango!

37:42.960 --> 37:44.462
There's three colors.

37:44.562 --> 37:47.466
You know, they all taste the same.

37:47.486 --> 37:52.494
The pink, the white, and the green.

37:52.514 --> 37:53.355
Lots of different types.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.858
But the question, Moco-chan!

37:54.878 --> 37:55.959
The question, Moco-chan!

37:55.979 --> 37:56.580
Do you like them?

37:57.321 --> 37:57.421
Yeah.

37:57.441 --> 37:57.822
Simple.

38:00.552 --> 38:07.962
And you know it's almost the time for lots of dango eating because it's springtime.

38:07.982 --> 38:09.104
Saishoku dango is good.

38:10.646 --> 38:13.910
Kusa dango.

38:14.511 --> 38:17.816
Definitely kusa dango!

38:17.936 --> 38:21.801
What's your favorite dango?

38:22.608 --> 38:24.411
I think I really like mitarashi dango.

38:24.431 --> 38:24.851
I think so too.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.816
I like sanshoku dango, but I like mitarashi dango.

38:29.538 --> 38:33.644
The sweet soy sauce is just, it's so salty but also very sweet.

38:33.885 --> 38:35.547
Yeah, it's yummy.

38:36.228 --> 38:40.074
And then you know, Fuwawa, I'm actually pretty good at making dango.

38:40.374 --> 38:40.735
So nice.

38:40.715 --> 38:41.476
Sometimes.

38:41.516 --> 38:43.018
Sometimes it's a big mistake.

38:43.038 --> 38:45.360
Sometimes it's just horrible.

38:45.401 --> 38:47.623
But you know that one time I was really good.

38:47.643 --> 38:47.964
One time?

38:48.024 --> 38:49.525
Which means I'm pretty good at it.

38:49.545 --> 38:49.646
Yeah.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.247
That one time.

38:51.267 --> 38:53.230
And you know, speaking of that!

38:53.710 --> 38:58.236
Just, you know, the other day Gura-senpai did a dance!

38:58.756 --> 39:02.841
She sang the song Daam Go Daai Kajoku from Twonaga!

39:02.821 --> 39:06.604
BAU BAU!

39:06.644 --> 39:32.828
Thank you for all of your submissions!

39:32.808 --> 39:42.999
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

39:43.059 --> 39:56.014
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.377
That's okay, use the hashtag.

39:58.437 --> 40:03.024
But you know, send us your vlogs, your burning questions!

40:03.304 --> 40:04.285
Answer them, you know!

40:04.325 --> 40:06.729
We don't really have too many of them often, right?

40:06.749 --> 40:08.751
And also don't forget as well!

40:08.812 --> 40:14.459
We have FUWAMOCO scoop, so if you think there's something you would like to see us cover, please let us know!

40:14.940 --> 40:19.386
But Ruffian, also if you happen to see Pero, maybe it's best if you let us know.

40:19.366 --> 40:21.191
That was Pero Sighting.

40:21.211 --> 40:25.503
And then we can inform all the other Ruffians too.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.689
But most importantly, use the hashtag.

40:27.950 --> 40:31.560
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

40:32.122 --> 40:34.388
BAU BAU!

40:34.368 --> 40:40.258
I'm so happy to have FUWAMOCO waiting back now!

40:40.278 --> 40:44.324
It doesn't feel like any time has gone by.

40:44.404 --> 40:46.047
Ruffians, let's get our next stream!

40:46.127 --> 40:50.875
Another stream coming up!

40:51.631 --> 40:53.854
On a schedule!

40:53.874 --> 41:01.465
On Tuesday the 11th, we're gonna be having an extra special HoloEN 6 Fest After Party Karaoke!

41:03.028 --> 41:04.910
All for FUWAMC BAU BAU!

41:04.930 --> 41:06.973
It's gonna be here on our channel!

41:06.993 --> 41:09.437
I don't know if a lot of Ruffians really noticed it.

41:09.890 --> 41:27.696
FUWAMOCO Morning you can count on one hand.

41:27.676 --> 41:34.106
Please join us!

41:34.888 --> 41:39.375
Will it be archived?

41:39.395 --> 41:41.899
It will be archived!

41:42.520 --> 41:49.752
Please join us for FWF!

41:49.732 --> 41:51.054
I'm super excited.

41:51.074 --> 41:55.440
And on the rest of our schedule, we have more FUWAMOCO Mornings!

41:55.460 --> 42:02.951
And on Friday, which is technically White Day, we're gonna be releasing a very special song cover!

42:02.971 --> 42:09.119
It's been quite a while since our last song cover release, so we hope that you'll be there to listen to it.

42:09.139 --> 42:11.082
I'm really nervous about this one.

42:11.062 --> 42:14.045
We're really nervous so please join us for it, okay?

42:14.305 --> 42:17.828
And then after that we'll be having a release after party.

42:17.848 --> 42:22.092
We'll be talking about why we chose it, the process, etc.

42:22.732 --> 42:27.617
And then on the 16th as well, on the Sunday, we're gonna be having a mini horror game festival.

42:28.097 --> 42:31.520
Playing a bunch of horror games that look kind of spooky and different.

42:31.821 --> 42:33.182
Maybe a little bit silly.

42:33.622 --> 42:36.265
So we hope you'll join that for us, Ruffians!

42:36.285 --> 42:39.988
Who knows how long it will be in enduring.

42:39.968 --> 42:43.732
BAU BAU!

42:43.752 --> 42:44.153
Thank you!

42:44.233 --> 42:47.537

42:50.320 --> 42:53.564
