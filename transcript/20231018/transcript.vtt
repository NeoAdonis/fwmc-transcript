05:06.986 --> 05:09.569
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:09.969 --> 05:13.433
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.513 --> 05:17.437
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:17.677 --> 05:19.499
BAU BAU!

05:20.100 --> 05:25.866
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:25.906 --> 05:28.048
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:28.528 --> 05:30.589
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:31.009 --> 05:34.971
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:35.631 --> 05:41.494
Thank you for joining us today for our 33rd episode!

05:41.514 --> 05:41.534
3-3.

05:42.214 --> 05:48.337
It feels like it was just the other day that was a 2-2.

05:48.437 --> 05:49.797
Moco-chan!

05:49.817 --> 05:51.978
Aren't you a bit energetic?

05:53.079 --> 05:53.199
Yeah.

05:57.406 --> 06:02.211
I saw some first-time ruffians joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning today.

06:02.392 --> 06:05.995
So just so you know, don't get confused.

06:06.176 --> 06:06.977
No confusion.

06:07.197 --> 06:08.218
No misunderstanding.

06:08.238 --> 06:16.066
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:16.086 --> 06:16.747
No Thursdays.

06:18.188 --> 06:19.208
Why is that, Moco-chan?

06:19.988 --> 06:22.389
Because it's not FUWAMOCO.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.009
Yeah!

06:24.130 --> 06:28.011
And the show is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:28.291 --> 06:34.752
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:35.173 --> 06:40.854
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:41.494 --> 06:45.495
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:45.575 --> 06:47.196
BAU BAU!

06:48.216 --> 06:48.776
BAU BAU!

06:49.637 --> 06:50.277
BAU BAU!

06:51.517 --> 06:52.117
BAU BAU!

06:52.417 --> 06:52.978
BAU BAU!

06:53.258 --> 06:53.858
BAU BAU!

06:54.138 --> 06:54.698
BAU BAU!

06:55.178 --> 06:55.798
BAU BAU!

06:56.139 --> 06:56.699
BAU BAU!

06:57.319 --> 06:58.939
This is an interesting discovery.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.820
A bit yappy today, huh?

07:02.340 --> 07:07.462
A little bit yappy today.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.883
Ruffians, have you seen Pero around recently?

07:10.963 --> 07:11.643
I think they have.

07:11.663 --> 07:15.184
Because we have another Pero sighting!

07:16.085 --> 07:17.165
Where is he this time?

07:20.893 --> 07:28.417
It looks like maybe this ruffian was a bit rudely disturbed when they were trying to clean up all the leaves.

07:28.457 --> 07:31.399
Was the ruffian disturbed or was Pero disturbed?

07:32.100 --> 07:32.680
Good question.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.063
Well, you know, ruffians, we talked about this a little bit before.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.885
Moco-chan, you like the leaves, right?

07:41.185 --> 07:44.687
Pero, Pero enjoys a good pile of all leaves too.

07:45.908 --> 07:49.310
He doesn't have to worry about bugs or dirt as much, though.

07:49.410 --> 07:50.491
Yeah, he's lucky.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.432
Yeah, he's round.

07:51.692 --> 07:53.773
He's not too fluffy, not too fuzzy.

07:53.793 --> 07:56.175
And he's pretty easy to watch, too.

07:56.335 --> 07:57.516
Yeah, he can clean well.

07:57.816 --> 07:58.357
Yeah.

07:58.897 --> 08:04.241
Although, you know, Pero does have to worry about grass stains sometimes.

08:04.281 --> 08:06.042
He does stain pretty easily, you know.

08:06.062 --> 08:09.364
But... Yeah... Ruffians.

08:09.624 --> 08:11.586
I'll be honest.

08:12.346 --> 08:14.808
You know, I've always sort of thought

08:16.434 --> 08:18.135
I wanna see a tie-dye perro.

08:19.255 --> 08:21.476
You know, it's sort of off-season.

08:21.796 --> 08:24.237
But he sort of look like an easter egg, right?

08:26.938 --> 08:27.378
It'd be fun.

08:29.528 --> 08:30.809
I don't know if you'd like that though.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.129
I don't care!

08:32.549 --> 08:36.991
But anyways, you know the fall leaves are super da fun.

08:37.771 --> 08:39.172
Right, Ruffians?

08:39.392 --> 08:45.814
And if you look, look really closely, some of the leaves in this pile kind of look like Pero's wings too.

08:46.654 --> 08:48.195
They're spiky and kind of like a...

08:48.775 --> 08:52.558
Maybe not quite a pale purple, but a pretty deep purple too.

08:54.119 --> 08:58.382
You know maybe that's what attracted him to the pile in particular to begin with.

08:59.323 --> 09:02.525
We're glad that he disappeared before you had to use violence though.

09:02.946 --> 09:03.746
Went once that.

09:04.847 --> 09:06.668
You know that might not have ended up well for you.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.384
BAU BAU!

09:12.444 --> 09:15.205
Good job getting up there and cleaning up those leaves.

09:15.345 --> 09:18.347
It must be cold, but you did it.

09:18.727 --> 09:20.728
BAU BAU!

09:21.488 --> 09:22.548
I love you.

09:23.149 --> 09:25.410
There's some exciting news coming up!

09:25.550 --> 09:27.150
Our senpai...

09:29.713 --> 09:34.399
Kaira-senpai is gonna be having her 3D showcase!

09:34.439 --> 09:42.650
Kaira-senpai's hololive ID is gonna be having her 3D showcase this Friday at 6am PT.

09:44.753 --> 09:47.037
FUWAMOCO Morning!

10:01.613 --> 10:04.376
Any ideas, ruffians?

10:04.396 --> 10:08.500
Real life Minecraft!

10:08.520 --> 10:11.382
That'd be pretty cool, too.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.906
I was kind of thinking that could be possible, too.

10:15.326 --> 10:16.868
I'm really curious.

10:17.709 --> 10:23.094
You know, seeing Zetta-senpai have such an eye-opening experience, too.

10:24.850 --> 10:28.673
We're really looking forward to seeing Kaira-senpai's showcase as well!

10:28.713 --> 10:29.773
Just what will she have?

10:29.793 --> 10:30.374
You know it!

10:30.394 --> 10:31.615
Super duper curious!

10:31.635 --> 10:33.096
Good luck, Kaira-senpai!

10:33.216 --> 10:33.716
BAU BAU!

10:33.756 --> 10:39.520
Make sure you watch Ruffians, okay?

10:39.540 --> 10:46.505
You know, it's just a couple hours before FUWAMOCO Morning, so... That's pretty easy to fit in the schedule, right?

10:46.525 --> 10:47.645
Just wake up a little bit.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.027
A little bit early.

10:50.147 --> 10:52.829
You know it's Kaira-senpai's special day, right?

10:52.849 --> 10:53.229
12 hours 3D!

10:56.132 --> 10:57.393
The happiness doesn't end!

11:06.584 --> 11:07.505
Another senpai.

11:07.525 --> 11:08.526
Another senpai.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.327
Another senpai.

11:09.828 --> 11:12.050
Hakui Koyori senpai!

11:12.070 --> 11:18.999
She just had her 150th episode of Asa Koyo yesterday!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.521
Bye-bye!

11:21.822 --> 11:24.845
Ruffians, you've seen Asa Koyo, right?

11:25.706 --> 11:25.967
Yeah.

11:27.843 --> 11:29.565
We're so happy for you!

11:29.605 --> 11:34.568
You know, we're sure it's a lot of work, but it's a show that's so well-loved by everyone.

11:34.788 --> 11:42.654
We hope that FUWAMOCO Morning can continue for a long time, just like Asahiyo, and become just as well-loved too.

11:43.375 --> 11:54.142
And Ruffians, it just wasn't the 115th episode, but Advent and even FUWAMOCO Morning from last Friday was featured on the episode too!

11:55.980 --> 11:58.062
I'm the 50th.

11:58.522 --> 12:00.184
We're really happy.

12:00.224 --> 12:05.008
Thank you so much for your support by Holodog.

12:05.148 --> 12:05.849
BAU BAU!

12:05.909 --> 12:08.691
BAU BAU!

12:08.971 --> 12:09.271
BAU BAU!

12:09.331 --> 12:14.696
And you might have caught it the other day.

12:19.121 --> 12:21.242
There's been some news.

12:21.762 --> 12:27.985
While this week, Advent, we're having a special Halloween party that we're putting on.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.406
But, not just that.

12:31.966 --> 12:33.047
There's been...

12:34.161 --> 12:39.283
Very special Halloween voice drama that was released!

12:39.403 --> 12:40.163
BAU BAU!

12:40.263 --> 12:41.464
Have you listened?

12:41.804 --> 12:42.204
Have you?

12:42.424 --> 12:42.984
Have you?

12:43.024 --> 12:43.324
I don't know.

12:43.564 --> 12:50.347
There might be some ruffians that still don't know, but this voice drama went on sale and it's called The Manor.

12:50.447 --> 12:57.370
It's very different from the usual voice parts because this time we became different roles and acted out a spooky mystery.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.911
It was a really fun experience, building on characters.

13:01.716 --> 13:02.617
I'm Maria.

13:02.737 --> 13:03.457
I'm Moco-chan.

13:03.557 --> 13:04.438
I'm Aria.

13:04.638 --> 13:07.440
I'm acting out the story and everything, too!

13:07.600 --> 13:08.181
It was good!

13:08.261 --> 13:08.781
You liked it?

13:08.801 --> 13:09.321

13:30.076 --> 13:30.176
You

13:30.536 --> 13:31.356
And Advent too!

13:31.376 --> 13:32.817
You know we did our best!

13:33.117 --> 13:37.257
It was really fun, so we hope that we can do more stuff like that in the future.

13:37.317 --> 13:42.138
It would be nice to be able to get more opportunities like this to grow ourselves and try new things.

13:42.238 --> 13:47.039
And ruffians, if you check it out, then that means you'll be able to hear FUWAMOCO's first attempt.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.420
Why are you laughing?

13:50.460 --> 13:51.380
First attempt!

13:51.480 --> 13:53.021
It was our first attempt.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.641
BAU BAU!

13:57.022 --> 13:59.982
Thank you!

14:00.022 --> 14:02.142
Look, Biboo's crying!

14:03.103 --> 14:05.203
You wanna hear why Biboo's crying?

14:05.343 --> 14:05.643
Why?

14:05.983 --> 14:07.263
You have to check it out!

14:07.363 --> 14:13.445
There's definitely a lot of different emotions, so... BAU BAU!

14:13.585 --> 14:13.965
Ruffians!

14:21.989 --> 14:23.530
End of the happy news for today.

14:24.670 --> 14:25.210
I don't know.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.371
This is a bit of a complicated feeling.

14:27.411 --> 14:28.532
Is it complicated?

14:30.172 --> 14:30.652
Yeah.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.514
Ruffians, we have an apology to make.

14:34.694 --> 14:35.874
But it's not to you.

14:35.894 --> 14:36.515
It's not to you.

14:36.535 --> 14:37.595
Why would we apologize?

14:39.096 --> 14:41.477
Did you see our Twitter this morning, Ruffians?

14:41.937 --> 14:46.399
Did you?

14:47.779 --> 14:49.660
Well, our neighbors

14:50.802 --> 14:53.023
My poor, poor neighbors.

14:56.984 --> 15:04.046
Actually, we might have been a little bit loud last night, but it wasn't our fault!

15:04.706 --> 15:09.367
You know, actually, we were up all night recording a song.

15:10.208 --> 15:14.289
Even though we're supposed to be quiet at night time so that everyone can sleep.

15:17.955 --> 15:19.836
Just this once we needed to do this.

15:19.856 --> 15:20.556
Just this once, okay?

15:20.576 --> 15:21.117
Just this once.

15:21.137 --> 15:25.419
We're very quiet almost all of the time otherwise.

15:25.519 --> 15:26.980
No BAU BAUing either.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.261
No.

15:28.361 --> 15:32.644
You know we have a strict rule of no streaming horror games during night because of this.

15:32.804 --> 15:33.244
Yeah.

15:33.264 --> 15:36.306
Because you know, we just can't control ourselves.

15:37.066 --> 15:41.069
Yeah, but we thought that maybe just this once would be okay.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.351
But, you know what?

15:45.023 --> 15:50.025
Our neighbors though, they're really really noisy most of the time.

15:50.305 --> 15:52.245
Even past midnight too.

15:52.445 --> 15:56.306
Now we can hear shouting and hammering and chopping.

15:56.486 --> 16:00.488
Even the songs that they're listening to on TV at all times of day and night.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.308
It doesn't stop.

16:03.248 --> 16:07.070
Once we even sung along with the lyrics of a song that they were playing.

16:09.315 --> 16:11.596
But you know, we never ever complain.

16:11.716 --> 16:12.217
It's okay.

16:12.397 --> 16:17.119
You know, instead we like to think of it as like a nice sign that we're not alone.

16:17.180 --> 16:17.420
Yeah.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.562
Yeah, so we hope that our singing maybe didn't keep them up.

16:21.922 --> 16:23.763
Maybe they could look at it positively.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.405
Yeah, maybe it was like a lullaby.

16:26.565 --> 16:30.087
Yeah, but if it wasn't, sorry neighbors.

16:30.107 --> 16:30.587
BAU BAU.

16:31.488 --> 16:32.028
BAU BAU.

16:34.667 --> 16:39.069
Ruffians, would you be okay with a lullaby through your walls?

16:43.190 --> 16:43.630
Bite them.

16:44.190 --> 16:44.770
Early access!

16:44.790 --> 16:46.091
I don't know if I want to bite them.

16:46.431 --> 16:46.971
Bite them?

16:47.391 --> 16:48.291
Why would I bite them?

16:49.132 --> 16:50.972
It would not be that tasty.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.473
Early access, right!

16:53.493 --> 16:54.834
Early access!

16:56.812 --> 16:58.093
BAU BAU!

16:58.133 --> 16:58.453
BAU BAU!

16:58.513 --> 16:58.893
BAU BAU!

17:17.503 --> 17:20.085
There's a misunderstanding, ruffians.

17:20.585 --> 17:22.086
That we kind of need to clear up.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.108
It's very important.

17:24.408 --> 17:27.450
There's been a lot of misunderstandings this week, Moco-chan.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.451
I thought we were doing better.

17:29.471 --> 17:30.712
I thought so too.

17:31.633 --> 17:35.535
Well... This is something we need you to understand, okay?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.858
Because you're the one who's misunderstanding this.

17:38.878 --> 17:39.058
Okay?

17:39.178 --> 17:40.038
It's not our fault.

17:40.138 --> 17:42.220
We saw that there are a number of ruffians.

17:43.424 --> 17:46.326
You seem to have an improper understanding of this.

17:46.866 --> 17:47.887
Yeah.

17:48.107 --> 17:56.834
Yeah, you seem to think that we always somehow have to mention or like include the fact that we're sweaty during every one of our streams.

17:58.335 --> 17:59.055
It's not the case.

17:59.235 --> 17:59.636
It's not.

17:59.996 --> 18:00.336
It's not.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.077
It's not the case.

18:01.097 --> 18:01.697
Not at all!

18:01.857 --> 18:02.718
Not at all!

18:02.738 --> 18:03.038
Ruffians!

18:06.200 --> 18:06.761
Ruffians.

18:08.222 --> 18:09.102
What the heck?! !

18:11.198 --> 18:11.978
What the heck?

18:12.539 --> 18:13.079
You know it.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.900
We don't enjoy it.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.360
But it's hot!

18:16.880 --> 18:18.641
It's really, really hot!

18:18.981 --> 18:23.443
You know, especially when we're focused on gaming or playing something scary.

18:23.963 --> 18:24.524
You know it.

18:25.944 --> 18:30.826
Especially when we're cramped close together in a room for a really long time.

18:30.906 --> 18:34.388
You know, the heat makes scary games even more intense for us.

18:35.028 --> 18:37.049
We're fighting for our lives.

18:38.564 --> 18:38.964
Okay?

18:39.765 --> 18:41.946
It's important that we let you know, ruffians.

18:43.227 --> 18:44.347
We are sweating!

18:44.947 --> 18:49.810
And that is how hard we are in that world and the reality of the game, okay?

18:50.470 --> 18:52.692
Real gamers, you got that?

18:52.952 --> 18:54.993
It's not that we want to, it just happens.

18:56.314 --> 19:07.540
And so, you know, if my hand slips and then I make a mistake in the game, or if Fuwawa's hand slips and she makes a mistake in the game, it's probably just because we're sweaty.

19:09.425 --> 19:17.868
But Ruffians, we told you before though, you know, sometimes it even gets to 32 or 33 degrees Celsius in our room.

19:17.888 --> 19:18.888
It's hot.

19:19.029 --> 19:20.809
It's not even summer anymore either.

19:20.849 --> 19:22.150
It's not summer, it's just hot.

19:22.190 --> 19:22.690
Yeah.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.131
You know, you would be sweating too, okay?

19:25.171 --> 19:25.531
Yeah.

19:25.991 --> 19:28.172
So don't misunderstand, okay?

19:28.492 --> 19:31.533
It's not like we want to share this info with you, okay?

19:32.133 --> 19:36.775
Yeah, but it's just, it's important info to add to our commentary, you know?

19:38.078 --> 19:38.799
Understood.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.060
True gaming.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.461
Okay, true gaming.

19:42.581 --> 19:42.941
Okay.

19:43.622 --> 19:44.863
Run the AC.

19:45.163 --> 19:46.844
We can't, the ruffians.

19:47.945 --> 19:48.746
You'd hear it.

19:49.246 --> 19:57.111
And it'd be like... No.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.453
That would be bad because then you'd get confused.

19:59.493 --> 20:01.615
Is that the AC or is that Moco-chan speaking?

20:02.455 --> 20:03.276
You wouldn't know.

20:03.616 --> 20:03.816
Pain!

20:05.836 --> 20:08.498
Please don't misunderstand, okay?

20:08.578 --> 20:10.239
It's important information.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.803
Okay, got it.

20:15.564 --> 20:17.585
You don't want to hear the AC, okay?

20:21.328 --> 20:23.129
BAU BAU.

20:23.209 --> 20:26.532
But my toes will stay warm, no matter how hot it is.

20:29.215 --> 20:29.875
Understood.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.356
Understandable.

20:31.476 --> 20:32.556
Understandable.

20:32.736 --> 20:33.036
Okay.

20:33.616 --> 20:34.317
Understandable.

20:34.357 --> 20:34.977
BAU BAU!

20:35.017 --> 20:38.498
BAU BAU!

20:38.858 --> 20:44.620
Now that the ruffians understand that, maybe we'll let them understand something extra nice.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.641
We'll let them understand!

20:48.721 --> 20:49.601
We will!

20:50.081 --> 20:50.561
We will!

20:50.581 --> 20:51.922
Ruffians.

20:52.002 --> 20:52.662
We know you're tired.

20:52.682 --> 20:55.483
We've been streaming a lot recently, right?

20:55.503 --> 20:56.023
We know.

20:56.553 --> 20:58.294
Listen to us stream.

20:59.314 --> 21:03.056
And we play Cookies and Cream for almost 7 hours!

21:03.757 --> 21:04.217
Right!

21:04.937 --> 21:06.558
It's been a bit busy, huh?

21:06.618 --> 21:10.820
So we thought, you know, we'd try to take things a bit easier this week.

21:11.641 --> 21:12.181
But...

21:13.206 --> 21:18.228
De-den!

21:18.408 --> 21:18.748
No!

21:18.888 --> 21:23.630
We decided to do a bonus stream on Thursday!

21:23.670 --> 21:33.533
Now on Thursday at 7am PT, 14 o'clock GMT, and 11pm JST, we'll be playing Holo no Suikai!

21:33.933 --> 21:37.794
A family game similar to other games you may know of.

21:39.741 --> 21:43.602
Yeah, we've been seeing a lot of our senpai playing it, so we're curious.

21:44.523 --> 21:47.244
Ruffians, have you seen senpai playing it yet?

21:47.724 --> 21:51.686
Are there hololive playing it?

21:51.706 --> 21:55.707
Yes, yes, yes!

21:59.212 --> 22:02.793
Hopefully, you decide to check it out with us too!

22:03.113 --> 22:07.775
You know, the fruit and... and... fruit are cute too.

22:07.835 --> 22:12.257
But, our senpai are... are even cuter, right ruffians?

22:13.757 --> 22:14.137
Right?

22:14.518 --> 22:14.978
Of course.

22:15.658 --> 22:16.738
You know the right answer.

22:17.239 --> 22:19.159
Of course, of course, of course.

22:19.179 --> 22:19.479
Fruit!

22:19.599 --> 22:20.440
Or Horoman.

22:23.522 --> 22:24.823
Right, right, right!

22:25.123 --> 22:28.545
It'll definitely be lots of fun for sure, okay?

22:28.585 --> 22:30.566
Let's all do our best to get a high score!

22:30.706 --> 22:40.252
Yeah, and it's at 7am, so it's a little bit earlier than FUWAMOCO Morning is usually, but maybe... Maybe it's sort of like a FUWAMOCO Morning on Thursday.

22:40.412 --> 22:41.612
On Thursday.

22:41.632 --> 22:44.894
So... Maybe I was being silly earlier, huh?

22:44.954 --> 22:47.936
Please, we hope to see you there!

22:47.996 --> 22:49.297
BAU BAU!

22:54.580 --> 22:55.721
Happy!

22:56.121 --> 22:58.343
That's all they need for the happy for today.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.565
You don't need any other happy for today, huh?

23:04.086 --> 23:08.489
Well, I guess the ruffians did understand now.

23:08.529 --> 23:10.170
They don't misunderstand anymore.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.552
No misunderstandings anymore.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.912
Maybe!

23:14.753 --> 23:15.573
I'll say something.

23:16.514 --> 23:16.774
Really?

23:24.252 --> 23:27.813
Ruffians!

23:29.874 --> 23:33.975
Ruffians!

23:35.295 --> 23:35.756
Hello!

23:37.616 --> 23:39.877
It's me, Mococo!

23:41.197 --> 23:42.738
And it's time!

23:43.678 --> 23:44.238
Yeah!

23:45.699 --> 23:46.439
Yeah!

23:47.219 --> 23:50.000
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

23:51.275 --> 23:55.498
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

23:57.000 --> 23:58.981
Are your eyes feeling a bit sleepy?

24:00.842 --> 24:03.044
Is your body feeling a bit slow?

24:03.064 --> 24:07.307
Well then, I have a secret to fix it.

24:09.709 --> 24:15.013
But, only if you promise to follow along with me, okay?

24:16.234 --> 24:16.895
You promise?

24:20.097 --> 24:20.698
You promise?

24:22.583 --> 24:23.904
Okay, you promise?

24:25.244 --> 24:25.604
Okay.

24:28.025 --> 24:31.186
First, let's stretch a bit to the left.

24:35.488 --> 24:36.128
Okay, good.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.990
Now, let's stretch a bit to the right!

24:42.951 --> 24:46.012
And now, let's spin ourselves around!

24:46.453 --> 24:47.693
Spin, spin!

24:50.994 --> 24:52.215
Okay, and next,

24:53.257 --> 24:55.578
Let's close our eyes really really tight.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.101
And open!

25:02.522 --> 25:04.723
Last step, okay.

25:05.423 --> 25:08.005
Let's let out a hearty BAU BAU.

25:08.505 --> 25:10.046
On the count of three.

25:11.346 --> 25:11.807
Okay!

25:12.447 --> 25:12.967
Three!

25:13.368 --> 25:13.688
Two!

25:13.808 --> 25:13.928
One!

25:14.348 --> 25:18.610
BAU BAU!

25:19.631 --> 25:19.851
There.

25:21.425 --> 25:23.887
Do you feel a bit more ready to take on today?

25:25.167 --> 25:26.088
You should!

25:26.949 --> 25:30.611
You're doing great even if sometimes your body doesn't want to keep up with you, okay?

25:31.512 --> 25:35.374
But make sure you do give yourself some good rest time, okay?

25:36.555 --> 25:39.777
I believe in you and your continued hard work every day.

25:41.078 --> 25:42.239
I know you're doing your best.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.462
Even if sometimes no one else notices it.

25:47.182 --> 25:50.726
What's important is that you recognize all your hard work.

25:51.307 --> 25:54.830
Because, you know, you know yourself best of all.

25:55.411 --> 25:56.232
You can do it!

25:56.252 --> 25:58.234
We believe in you!

25:58.775 --> 25:59.716
Ganbatte ne!

25:59.756 --> 26:01.017
BAU BAU!

26:01.057 --> 26:01.377
BAU BAU!

26:08.570 --> 26:09.692
Wow, I feel ready.

26:09.972 --> 26:11.153
I feel ready too, Moco-chan.

26:11.193 --> 26:14.297
Are you all good for taking today on the right paw?

26:14.317 --> 26:15.058
I am.

26:15.078 --> 26:18.202
Hopefully the ruffians are too.

26:18.222 --> 26:23.949
Now on to our Doggie of the Day!

26:24.090 --> 26:25.992
Who's our Doggie of the Day today?

26:26.052 --> 26:26.573
We have...

26:28.074 --> 26:30.035
It's Steven!

26:30.115 --> 26:32.477
Steven is the Doggie of the Day today!

26:32.497 --> 26:38.840
Steven loves science, so you know he was checking out the solar eclipse with his ruffian.

26:39.381 --> 26:40.061
You know what?

26:41.822 --> 26:45.384
When I first saw this, I was a bit shocked.

26:46.025 --> 26:46.305
What?

26:46.465 --> 26:47.465
I was a bit scared.

26:49.227 --> 26:49.967
Oh no, right?

26:50.087 --> 26:50.847
Oh no, right?

26:51.428 --> 26:53.289
I thought he had a cleaver through his head.

26:53.589 --> 26:55.670
You know, like a Halloween costume?

26:55.690 --> 26:56.111
No, no.

26:58.114 --> 27:01.076
Steven's just trying to check out the eclipse safely.

27:01.096 --> 27:01.637
That's it!

27:02.337 --> 27:02.758
That's it!

27:03.478 --> 27:04.239
Same!

27:04.619 --> 27:06.461
Ruffians thought the same, right?

27:07.081 --> 27:07.822
What?

27:08.382 --> 27:09.323
I don't know.

27:09.443 --> 27:11.625
Ruffians are silly, but you know what?

27:12.025 --> 27:15.388
I saw a bunch of Ruffians go out to see the eclipse.

27:16.809 --> 27:17.630
That's pretty cool.

27:17.650 --> 27:18.170
That's nice.

27:18.831 --> 27:21.233
Yeah, we hope you enjoyed it, Ruffians!

27:22.013 --> 27:23.715
We didn't even realize it happened.

27:25.350 --> 27:35.158
If you had told us, we could have gone and seen it too so that we could have watched it all together, but... Well... That's okay, that's okay.

27:35.178 --> 27:35.959
It was cool?

27:36.099 --> 27:37.160
I'm glad for you.

27:37.580 --> 27:38.561
I'm really glad.

27:38.581 --> 27:40.142
BAU BAU!

27:40.182 --> 27:44.966
My god, Steven enjoyed it too!

27:45.126 --> 27:46.928
At least Steven enjoyed it in our place.

27:47.928 --> 27:50.791
Well, how does Steven BAU BAU?

27:50.931 --> 27:52.912
Maybe like a raspy BAU BAU?

27:52.932 --> 27:54.554
I think he does it with a lot of teeth, like...

27:55.350 --> 27:56.773
I don't know.

27:56.813 --> 28:00.339
Don't you think it's maybe loud enough to reach the moon?

28:05.492 --> 28:07.273
Nothing stops Steven from knowledge!

28:32.930 --> 28:33.870
Science dog.

28:34.030 --> 28:37.391
Or also maybe hugs from his beloved ruffian.

28:37.731 --> 28:38.671
Science and hugs.

28:38.971 --> 28:39.731
That's what he likes.

28:40.672 --> 28:41.272
BAU BAU!

28:41.312 --> 28:43.112
BAU BAU!

28:43.132 --> 28:43.932
Thank you!

28:43.952 --> 28:49.413
Next we have... Today I went on a walk!

28:50.294 --> 28:52.214
Where did this ruffian go today?

28:52.234 --> 28:52.714
De-den!

28:53.514 --> 28:55.535
Pretty!

28:56.395 --> 28:57.015
This ruffian...

28:58.086 --> 29:00.667
They made a haiku when they went on a walk too.

29:00.687 --> 29:00.927
That's nice.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.808
A haiku about the changing seasons.

29:03.969 --> 29:04.369
Fall.

29:04.950 --> 29:05.810
A leaf falls.

29:06.130 --> 29:06.710
Austere.

29:07.431 --> 29:08.131
Trees fall.

29:08.551 --> 29:09.092
Unnoticed.

29:09.492 --> 29:09.992
Silent.

29:10.853 --> 29:13.474
Breathe floats, yet falls still.

29:13.694 --> 29:14.955
Beautiful.

29:17.955 --> 29:26.081
It looks like it was a really peaceful walk when you went, and maybe that you were able to reflect on the changing seasons and the world around you!

29:26.101 --> 29:26.862
So nice!

29:27.322 --> 29:32.386
You know, and despite it maybe not being the greatest weather, you still went and you did it!

29:32.686 --> 29:33.507
That's great!

29:34.707 --> 29:38.030
We hope you continue to write lots of haikus too!

29:38.470 --> 29:39.071
BAU BAU!

29:42.161 --> 29:43.101
I like the reflection.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.402
Right is very pretty.

29:44.422 --> 29:46.223
Very relaxing.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.263
Good for poetry.

29:47.703 --> 29:51.044
Well, we also received a question of the day, too.

29:51.404 --> 29:52.245
Let's see.

29:52.265 --> 29:53.245
De-den!

29:54.425 --> 29:56.106
Question for FUWAMOCO!

29:56.346 --> 30:00.567
Do you two have any advice on how to make a tough decision?

30:00.867 --> 30:08.050
There may be some ruffians who feel like they are at a crossroads and can't decide which direction to go.

30:08.190 --> 30:10.091
Very interesting hearing from my oshis.

30:10.391 --> 30:10.951
BAU BAU!

30:13.232 --> 30:15.733
It's a good question.

30:16.893 --> 30:21.315
You know, we've had to make some very tough decisions in the past too.

30:21.855 --> 30:28.698
And actually, one thing that has never failed us when we're really stuck and not sure what to do.

30:30.754 --> 30:35.496
It's a bit simple, so you won't laugh, right, Ruffians?

30:36.116 --> 30:37.096
Don't laugh, okay?

30:38.397 --> 30:38.997
Don't laugh.

30:41.278 --> 30:45.560
It's actually a pros and cons list!

30:45.640 --> 30:47.801
You'd be surprised!

30:47.821 --> 30:48.901
Don't laugh!

30:48.961 --> 30:50.141
Don't laugh, okay?

30:50.622 --> 30:56.104
There was actually one time where we both had to make a super important decision and we thought

30:56.884 --> 30:58.606
It's silly how it's just something simple, right?

31:16.516 --> 31:20.297
But you know, in the end, it was the right decision that was it.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.278
So we don't regret it at all.

31:22.878 --> 31:32.881
So, our advice to you ruffians is that if you ever have to make a tough decision, get a notebook and make your pros and cons columns and then start thinking really hard.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.262
Eventually you'll find the answer that you're searching for.

31:36.282 --> 31:37.562
I think so.

31:37.783 --> 31:38.883
That's our advice.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.884
As long as you're happy with it.

31:41.944 --> 31:48.867
It's important to think about all the things, all the situations, what you think is best for you.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.969
We're good at thinking about lots of stuff, huh?

31:55.461 --> 31:57.362
Sometimes maybe a bit too good, huh?

31:57.562 --> 31:57.962
Maybe.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.943
BAU BAU!

32:01.163 --> 32:03.344
Thank you for the really good questions!

32:03.564 --> 32:06.686
And thank you, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

32:06.706 --> 32:10.407
We're always looking for more Doggies of the Days.

32:11.488 --> 32:12.568
Doggies of the Days.

32:12.608 --> 32:13.569
Doggies of the Days.

32:14.129 --> 32:15.830
See the walks you're going on.

32:15.870 --> 32:18.151
Questions, questions, questions, questions.

32:18.171 --> 32:20.432
And Pero Sightings too.

32:20.552 --> 32:20.852
Please.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.933
Please send your submissions in a foot!

32:22.973 --> 32:24.514
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show we make together.

32:24.554 --> 32:26.255
Yeah, but don't forget the hashtag.

32:26.276 --> 32:30.278
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

32:31.239 --> 32:32.700
BAU BAU!

32:32.760 --> 32:35.442
BAU BAU!

32:35.542 --> 32:39.485
For our next stream, we have... In case you didn't know, today is...

32:40.751 --> 32:41.791
De-den!

32:41.811 --> 32:43.232
Resident Evil Wednesday!

32:43.512 --> 32:44.292
Yeah!

32:44.612 --> 32:47.454
Tonight is a part of Advent Halloween Party.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.974
We'll be playing a game that's pretty spooky.

32:50.595 --> 32:53.076
Resident Evil 4 Remake.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.296
But as Moco-chan, you kind of said there.

32:55.376 --> 32:55.797
I don't know.

32:55.817 --> 32:57.837
Do the ruffians hear it?

32:58.278 --> 32:59.338
But today is Wednesday!

32:59.618 --> 33:08.661
Which means, by rule of FUWAMOCO, we have to play Resident Evil 4 because it's Resident Evil Wednesday this month!

33:08.681 --> 33:09.982
Resident Evil Wednesday.

33:12.621 --> 33:14.302
Resident Evil Wednesday.

33:14.322 --> 33:18.125
Moco-chan, you got it all wrong.

33:19.026 --> 33:20.327
Can you say it properly?

33:20.347 --> 33:22.949
Resident Evil... No!

33:23.150 --> 33:23.690
Start again.

33:24.110 --> 33:25.472
Resident... No!

33:25.772 --> 33:26.412
I can hear it.

33:27.575 --> 33:29.996
Why is it an evil Wednesday?

33:30.016 --> 33:30.796
Yeah.

33:32.717 --> 33:40.301
But I don't know if it's getting any easier for us because now that the zombies are infected with the weird ham virus.

33:40.741 --> 33:42.722
I don't want to spend that much ammo on them.

33:43.762 --> 33:45.803
Please help us, okay, Ruffians?

33:46.043 --> 33:47.664
It's getting scarier, I think.

33:49.099 --> 33:49.960
BAU BAU!

33:50.660 --> 33:51.701
BAU BAU!

33:51.721 --> 33:55.104
Well, let's take a peek at our schedule for this week!

33:55.144 --> 33:57.125
Our schedule!

33:57.185 --> 34:06.993
We have lots of spooky streams coming up, but we keep on mentioning it because we're really looking forward to our FUWAMOCO Valkenborn Party!

34:10.427 --> 34:18.337
We're really excited because, you know, we're gonna be singing a few songs that we didn't think we'd be able to sing, but they're some of our favorites.

34:18.818 --> 34:21.882
We didn't think we'd be ever able to sing them.

34:21.962 --> 34:22.282
No.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.725
We worked really hard so that we can sing them.

34:25.627 --> 34:27.429
Just for you, okay?

34:27.930 --> 34:29.331
Lots of special surprises.

34:30.307 --> 34:34.052
But you might not be too familiar with some of the songs.

34:34.733 --> 34:37.536
But we'd like it if you could still come and take a listen.

34:37.777 --> 34:43.885
Or maybe you can enjoy them while munching on some spooky snacks and howling along with us too.

34:44.025 --> 34:45.487
Does that sound good, Ruffians?

34:47.079 --> 34:47.560
BAU BAU!

35:02.045 --> 35:09.271
Thank you, ruffians, for joining us today for our very special FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:09.311 --> 35:10.452
Thank you!

35:10.632 --> 35:17.718
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special ruffians today!

35:17.738 --> 35:18.319

35:19.740 --> 35:20.060

35:41.780 --> 35:47.641
And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

35:47.901 --> 35:50.802
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:50.822 --> 35:51.903
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

35:52.083 --> 35:52.703
BAU BAU!
