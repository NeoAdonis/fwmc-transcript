## 🙊 Confession ([11:37](https://youtu.be/A844xQnE97A?t=11m37s))

Some Ruffians might have found that FUWAMOCO liked a [peculiar drawing of Choco-sensei (made by Guchico-sensei)](https://twitter.com/Guchico77/status/1706617389419553218) on Twitter. It seems that, while Fuwawa bookmarked the tweet to ask Mococo if they should give it a like, it was Mococo who impulsively liked the tweet in the end in appreciation of the cuteness reflected in the picture.

[LordBrocolli](https://twitter.com/KnightofFate/status/1707524643832422772) asks FUWAMOCO for their favorite fall activities. The twins seem to like the air and smell of fall, and going for a walk. As for specific activities, they love helping Mama puppy and Papa puppy to clean the leaves, which Mococo uses as an opportunity to jump on the leaves despite the bugs and dirt.
