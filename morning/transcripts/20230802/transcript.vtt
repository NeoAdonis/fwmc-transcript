It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:44.365
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.451
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:58.232
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.033
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:03.454

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:14.458
On the first official episode, right?

00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:15.958

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.443
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand
new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:49.964
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:53.067
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:59.051
Well, maybe we'll jump right into things.

00:06:00.052 --> 00:06:01.893
What's this? What's this? What's this?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:08.818
We just reached 700,000
views on our cover of Kaibutsu!

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:09.950
Thank you!

00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:11.611
BAU BAU!

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.233
I'm really really happy that you
have been enjoying it so much.

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:19.916
Do you have any favorite parts?

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:23.859
Moco-chan, do you have a favorite part?

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.275
- I like the beginning too.
- The beginning?

00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:29.772
There's a part in the very very
beginning, Moco-chan, that you sing,

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:32.686
that your voice gets all like...

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:34.771
- I like that part.
- What part is that?

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:36.998
<i>Subarashiki sekai e...</i>

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.501
I'm not too sure.

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:43.082
You have to listen closely, Ruffians.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.323
It'll be in the first couple seconds.

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:49.504
We've seen in the comments that a lot
of listeners seem to hear Marine-senpai.

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:57.067
Marine-senpai... Last time I checked,
she's... She's not part of FUWAMOCO.

00:06:57.287 --> 00:06:59.747
Unfortunately, she's not.

00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:03.295
But it makes us happy that you
would compliment us that way because

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.350
we very much love Marine-senpai
and Marine-senpai's voice.

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:10.124
Big compliment.

00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:11.265
She wants to apply!

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:13.387
What would her name be?

00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:18.092
I don't know if Lui-senpai
would be okay with that.

00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:31.033
But would you like to hear more songs?

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:32.474
More cover songs from us?

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:34.457
What would you like to hear?

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:37.995
There's a lot of really good
songs so it's hard to decide.

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:42.147
Actually, it did take us quite a while
to decide which song we wanted

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:43.977
- to pick for our very first cover.
- It's difficult, y'know?

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.097
There's so many good songs.

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:46.317
Right, you know?

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:50.298
And they can show all different
types of you, so, you know?

00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.439
There's those kind
of ways to enjoy it too.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:56.534
300! 300 of them. Ohh!

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.137
Idol by YOASOBI-san.

00:07:59.971 --> 00:08:02.575
Are we gonna be stuck
just to YOASOBI songs?

00:08:03.496 --> 00:08:04.644
That's not too bad though...

00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:06.504
Ah, Tuning Love?

00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:09.325
Tuning Love's cute too.

00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:11.529
Lots of good suggestions.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.134
Kagamine Twins.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:18.960
We definitely didn't
have that thought too.

00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.483
But thank you so much for listening to it.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:24.467
We hope that you continue to
enjoy it more and more and more.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.410
We can hit 1 million?

00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.492
That would be a big team.

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:32.373
Big, big, big team.

00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:35.388
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- No, no, not yet. No.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.737
Maybe we can in the future.

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.217
Thank you!

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:46.122
But next, there's been
another misunderstanding.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.421
Misunderstanding.

00:08:55.483 --> 00:09:02.207
I wanted to say, so last FUWAMOCO
Morning, everyone was discussing tomorrow.

00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:03.588
And you know it.

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:05.469
I got confused.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.612
Yeah, because there's a lot
of things I don't understand.

00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:12.714
But I feel like tomorrow isn't one of them.

00:09:13.434 --> 00:09:17.776
I just thought that, you know,
there's two popular movies right now.

00:09:18.337 --> 00:09:20.815
So then I thought maybe
it was something from that

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.834
because there's like a
lot of things I don't know.

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:26.842
And the senpai members have been
sending us a lot of things I don't know.

00:09:27.342 --> 00:09:32.845
So I thought, but maybe it's from the
movies or maybe it was from Die Hard.

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:35.286
Since I've never seen that
movie and people like it.

00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:37.600
It seems sort of like something
that would be in Die Hard.

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:42.029
But no, Moco-chan, you're just like

00:09:42.054 --> 00:09:46.435
"I don't know," lots of things,
so it's probably not that, right?

00:09:46.682 --> 00:09:47.774
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:51.068
Obviously, we really like hololive, but

00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:53.640
It's very hard to know
everything about hololive.

00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.843
But yeah, this was one of them.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:02.908
Actually, actually, we took the
official hololive quiz, the <i>hololive Kentei</i>.

00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:06.177
I'm not sure if you did it.

00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:08.776
Unfortunately, you can't take it anymore.

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.399
The testing period is over.

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:13.285
But we wanted to share our
scores with you, you know?

00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:20.651
<i>hololive ID Kentei</i>,
<i>hololive English Kentei</i>,

00:10:20.675 --> 00:10:24.576
And then <i>hololive JP Kentei</i>.
Even the JP one in Japanese too.

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:26.678
We passed!

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.160
The official test.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.722
Official test, you know.

00:10:31.302 --> 00:10:35.747
We were really nervous about
it because they're really hard.

00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:36.772
Really, really hard.

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:40.392
You know, we study up a lot.

00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:44.777
Maybe we studied a bit too much.

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.581
But we figured, you know, this
would be the least we could do.

00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:52.526
And obviously, by no means does
it mean that we know everything.

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:53.587
We don't know everything.

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.249
We don't know nothing.

00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:02.280
We'd like to know more
too, but we're also

00:11:02.305 --> 00:11:05.978
We're also very forgetful puppies
when we're under pressure.

00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:11.199
So like, if you were to ask me,
Fuwawa, what are you streaming next?

00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:12.840
I'd be like, I don't know!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.880
Right, right.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.721
So we have to make notes sometimes.

00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:21.322
Alright, so more puppies, thank you!

00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:23.862
We're pleased,
Moco-chan, we're pleased.

00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:27.403
It was very fun though, but...

00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:32.760
It reminded me of being back
at Guard Dog Training, right?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.140
Right.

00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:35.541
- It was tricky.
- It was tricky.

00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:36.574
Tricky, tricky.

00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:40.423
Definitely recommend if they do
<i>hololive Kentei</i> the official quiz again.

00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:42.477
- Right?
- You get your certification.

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:44.301
- Certification.
- Yeah.

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:50.647
But also, there's been
another misunderstanding.

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.748
This time it wasn't Mococo.

00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:56.310
It was me.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:02.639
During our Question and Answer
stream, I picked up a comment about

00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:08.716
Takenoko vs Kinoko, which is Takenoko's
bamboo shoots and Kinoko's mushrooms.

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:16.941
I thought, you know, the yummiest ones are
<i>actual</i> mushrooms and <i>actual</i> bamboo shoots.

00:12:17.624 --> 00:12:20.144
And not the chocolate snacks, you know,

00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:23.484
The <i>Kinoko no Yama</i> and <i>Takenoko no Sato</i>.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:28.850
- She though <i>actual</i> ones.
- So I don't want you to misunderstand that

00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:32.235
Our decision when it comes
to the chocolate snacks.

00:12:32.937 --> 00:12:36.537
When it comes to the
actual vegetables, you know?

00:12:37.754 --> 00:12:39.376
All mushrooms are good!

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.157
- We're not like Nerissa or Biboo.
- No!

00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:44.662
- All mushrooms are delicious.
- Mushrooms are very very yummy.

00:12:44.687 --> 00:12:46.012
But what about Nameko?

00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:48.116
Nameko!

00:12:48.338 --> 00:12:51.510
- It might be a bit tricky.
- Maybe it's still a bit tricky.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.213
I like it, but it's a bit
difficult to eat a lot of them.

00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:59.406
But to set the score right, when it comes
to the chocolate snack, we like...

00:13:03.556 --> 00:13:04.690
Neither!

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.741
Yeah, you know it's chocolate.

00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:10.362
The actual veggie is yummy.

00:13:10.862 --> 00:13:12.922
I prefer to have the actual vegetables.

00:13:13.262 --> 00:13:14.682
No chocolate. No snacks.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840
Got it?

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:19.184
- Understood?
- Understood.

00:13:19.624 --> 00:13:24.066
That is the end of the
Takenoko vs Kinoko debate.

00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:25.326
The misunderstanding.

00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:28.047
It's all cleared.

00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:31.408
We can start our day
knowing that it's all good now.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:40.645
Well, today we wanted to introduce
our first thoughts about Advent.

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:42.466
What was it like meeting Advent?

00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:46.730
Moco-chan prepared
something very special.

00:13:47.848 --> 00:13:48.848
I hope you like it.

00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:50.813
I did my best, okay?

00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:54.776
First up, we have Shiori!

00:13:57.728 --> 00:14:00.610
Our first thoughts of Shiori.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.911
The first thing she said, I
remember it very clearly.

00:14:02.931 --> 00:14:04.212
She went, Shiori!

00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:06.933
It was really cute.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:10.675
So cute that I kind of
thought like, is she joking?

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.917
It was that big of a gap!

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:16.138
- It's very good.
- Oh, right?

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:21.293
And then she was like really, really
stoic and kind of like a bit of a

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:27.343
hard to read ear to her, so it was a very
interesting first impression, I think.

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:28.924
Very like <i>kakkoike</i>.

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.303
Yeah.

00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:34.215
I think to be completely honest,
we were a bit scared of her at first,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.868
you know, especially with her
really strong piercing bird-like eyes.

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:41.650
But I feel like, you know,

00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:46.113
It was a bit of a funny
feeling at first, you know?

00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:50.695
We felt a bit troubled actually
because we wanted to get

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.539
to know Shiori better, but
we just felt like we couldn't.

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:58.361
Like, really like, we're like, uh, FUWAMOCO
what are we doing wrong, you know?

00:14:59.722 --> 00:15:02.451
We would kind of think
of strategies, you know.

00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:05.303
Things to get her
to maybe warm up to us.

00:15:05.543 --> 00:15:07.436
- Or us to warm up to her.
- Right?

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:09.309
You know?

00:15:09.496 --> 00:15:13.745
She was a really tough book to crack,
but all of a sudden, that just changed.

00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:16.366
And we don't feel that
way anymore, you know?

00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.806
Shiori's really, really sweet.

00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:22.587
I think she definitely tries to put
on a strong face, like, I'm so cool.

00:15:22.927 --> 00:15:24.607
But she's actually really, really sweet.

00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:27.648
And even I feel like a
bit shy sometimes, too.

00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:30.909
- She's really dependable.
- Dependable!

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:34.829
And she has so, so, so
much knowledge in that.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:36.730
We wish we could
Google search her brain.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.070
Right? She has a lot
going on in her noggin.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.291
So, it'd be nice to search
it, but... You can't do that.

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:46.681
Yeah, we don't really want
to overburden her with

00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:50.192
All our FUWAMOCO questions
and requests and stuff like that.

00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:54.585
Yeah. And that's the other thing,
you know, if the other Advent members,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.094
If they let us be needy,
right, we're gonna be needy.

00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:01.296
It's not good. They need to not spoil us.

00:16:01.817 --> 00:16:03.678
We love Shiori!

00:16:03.778 --> 00:16:07.501
We love you Shiori!

00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:09.783
We hope you like
Moco-chan's illustration.

00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:12.905
I did my best. I really captured your eyes.

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:14.586
I think so, I think so.

00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:15.947
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:18.730
Does it look just like her?

00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:20.249
It does, right?

00:16:20.674 --> 00:16:21.729
"Adorable?"

00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:24.993
"It's cute?" Thank you! Thank you!

00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:26.960
OK, well...

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:31.325
Next Advent member is Biboo!

00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:36.706
I think one of the first things
she said was "I'm really shy."

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:39.787
But that lasted really
for about 30 minutes.

00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:43.989
I don't think she's that shy.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:46.569
Maybe she's shy like us.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.870
Maybe.

00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:50.187
Do you think we're shy?
I think we're shy.

00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:52.433
Maybe we're the same kind of shy.

00:16:52.733 --> 00:16:56.336
But she's very cute and a
very sharp rock, you know?

00:16:57.176 --> 00:16:59.309
I think she kind of
downplays her powers.

00:16:59.402 --> 00:17:00.402
Yeah.

00:17:00.557 --> 00:17:02.197
You know, that makes her a bit cuter too.

00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:04.342
But we can see through that.

00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:07.384
And I think she's really
a master of her craft.

00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:09.826
Yeah. I mean, she's had
years and years and years

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:12.532
- Right?
- To become a beautiful gem, so,

00:17:12.987 --> 00:17:14.310
Very very sharp.

00:17:15.753 --> 00:17:17.794
At first we were really
surprised to hear that

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.830
She likes to play games for a long
time and that's normal for her, but

00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:24.078
We were also really happy
because we know that

00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:27.665
FUWAMOCO, we're not
quite like that, too, so y'know

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.144
Sometimes it can be a bit tough.

00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:33.190
It's good to have lots of different
flavors within Advent, you know?

00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:35.895
I'm just happy that she likes it
and that she's not pushing herself.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.854
She's definitely the gamer.

00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:42.457
I think there was one time where

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:45.763
there was a reference that she wasn't
a gamer, and Biboo got

00:17:46.063 --> 00:17:47.691
- Kinda grumpy.
- It's like "excuse me?!"

00:17:47.716 --> 00:17:48.716
Right. Right?

00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:54.780
She's super sweet and super
cute and. you know, she just

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.179
We get this really,
really strong feeling that

00:17:57.204 --> 00:18:00.250
We <i>really</i> need to protect her extra hard.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.410
Even though she's always
smiling, she's strong.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.171
She's probably fine.

00:18:05.231 --> 00:18:10.154
We worry about her, so we want
to make sure she's smiling too.

00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:12.576
We feel very protectable.

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:15.498
We're protecting her smile too, sorry.

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:21.461
I was thinking though, you know...
Biboo has her little flaps, right?

00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.963
They look kind of like ears, but...
And like, Biboo can fly too, right?

00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:29.373
So I was thinking that... I don't
know if Biboo can do this, but

00:18:29.398 --> 00:18:32.146
It'd be nice to kind of fly
together with Biboo's flaps.

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:37.869
And then like, our twin
tails could go like... Yeah.

00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:40.090
We can fly as a group together.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.051
I guess with Nerissa too.

00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:44.612
Shiori can just ride on the back.

00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:46.479
Oh really? I was gonna
say we'll make her walk.

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:55.673
And then Biboo's song cover, it
actually makes us really, really emotional.

00:18:56.795 --> 00:18:58.038
I was listening to it for...

00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:01.024
Another countless times.

00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:03.905
And actually eating some
chicken at the same time.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.500
And I started to get teary while I
was eating it so it was like extra salty.

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:13.471
If you haven't listened to it, you
need to go and listen to it, OK?

00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:14.496
It's perfect.

00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:18.430
- And that's Biboo.
- Biboo.

00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:23.478
- Next is...
- Fuwawa doesn't mince words.

00:19:23.503 --> 00:19:24.583
What did she say wrong?

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:25.839
What, what, what, what, what?

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:27.586
Did I say something wrong again?

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:30.739
Are we gonna have to have
another misunderstanding corner

00:19:30.764 --> 00:19:32.311
for the next FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:19:32.474 --> 00:19:34.333
It's just gonna be a regular corner.

00:19:34.353 --> 00:19:36.095
It's gonna be a regular, right?

00:19:36.715 --> 00:19:37.715
Oh well.

00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:41.020
And last but not least...

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:43.565
Nerissa!

00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:46.549
Nerissa, you know, she's...

00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:49.171
Out of Advent, she's
definitely the lady that's

00:19:49.196 --> 00:19:51.599
Not afraid to share what
she's passionate about.

00:19:56.976 --> 00:19:59.581
I did a good job capturing
your likeness, right?

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.959
- She has lady lips, right?
- Yeah.

00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:06.021
Now I'm kinda sad.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.272
But you know, Nerissa, she also
has a bit of a baby-ness to her.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:11.393
Yeah, she's a lady baby.

00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:12.553
Lady baby.

00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:16.555
But of course, she has
an amazing singing voice.

00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:19.056
You know, sometimes she'll...
Sometimes? All the time!

00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:23.578
She says, like, I'm not very good,
you know, because of my horn issue.

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:25.499
Her horn's hurt. It makes sense, I guess.

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:28.422
Yeah, you know, and she
causes damage to your mind

00:20:28.447 --> 00:20:30.509
when she starts singing and stuff, but...

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:34.794
Imagine if she didn't have her horn
broken, then we'd all be done for.

00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.040
- We'd be done.
- Yeah

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.476
She has her horn damaged and
yet we're all still, still like, smitten.

00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:42.299
Addicted. Yeah.

00:20:42.635 --> 00:20:44.597
I don't know about you, Ruffians, but...

00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.793
Have you been able to get Love
Me Love Me out of your head?

00:20:48.273 --> 00:20:54.556
Because I know that... I woke up
and it was just the... Give me your love!

00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:56.304
That's all that's in my head! So,

00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:58.018
- It's no good!
- It's no good.

00:20:58.043 --> 00:21:00.340
Lifetime Showtime is competing.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.981
It's competing.

00:21:02.181 --> 00:21:03.221
Oh, they're rivals.

00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:08.083
Yeah, it must be Nerissa's
demonic powers, right?

00:21:09.624 --> 00:21:12.266
The other thing that comes to
mind, I think, the first,

00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:14.386
- The first impression.
- The first impression?

00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:18.428
Nerissa really likes to be physical
with us and the other element members.

00:21:18.514 --> 00:21:24.935
I remember when we first saw her, it kind
of looked like she had made Biboo her toy.

00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:28.392
- Tiny toy.
- Tiny toy.

00:21:28.925 --> 00:21:30.230
They were like stuck together.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.813
Probably against Biboo's
will, but Biboo was just smiling.

00:21:35.913 --> 00:21:39.635
And then, there was one
time, suddenly I think...

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.143
Just suddenly, out of nowhere,
Nerissa just Kabedon'd me!

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.845
Very casually.

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:52.771
My first kabedon, I tried really
hard to have a straight face,

00:21:52.796 --> 00:21:55.049
But inside I was panicking.

00:21:55.074 --> 00:21:56.176
It was too casual.

00:21:56.391 --> 00:21:59.093
It was too casual, just all of a
sudden she's just like, heh heh.

00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:02.496
Yeah, I was surprised.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.638
Have you ever been
Kabedon'd, Ruffians?

00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:08.031
Maybe? Maybe we'll have the

00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:10.189
- opportunity to introduce you.
- Nerissa says she's sorry.

00:22:10.214 --> 00:22:12.007
- She's sorry?
- Are you sure?

00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:16.509
I was trying to be strong, but inside I was
like... You liked it though, didn't you?

00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:19.270
No, no, no. Nerissa! Nerissa!

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.811
Me? Me?!

00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:23.029
- No, no, no. Nerissa.
- Nerissa?

00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:26.939
I wonder what was going
through Nerissa's head.

00:22:27.104 --> 00:22:28.157
What was her motive?

00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:30.101
Maybe she wanted to
just make you flustered.

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:31.691
Maybe. And,

00:22:31.716 --> 00:22:34.866
Then I did the perfect thing.
I just had a straight face.

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:35.966
No reaction.

00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:37.560
She did enjoy it, huh?

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:40.659
- But the other thing...
- I'm safe.

00:22:40.684 --> 00:22:43.073
The other thing about Nerissa.

00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:45.495
Her legs are very pretty.

00:22:45.835 --> 00:22:47.336
Especially when she crosses them.

00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:49.876
It was hard not to stare.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:53.617
But I made sure you know,
I made sure to compliment.

00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:58.820
Because I thought, maybe
that might make Nerissa happy.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.681
She seems the type.

00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:01.909
What? The type?

00:23:01.934 --> 00:23:02.942
What does that mean?

00:23:03.162 --> 00:23:05.063
The type to like those
kind of compliments.

00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:06.283
It's a nice compliment.

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:09.965
If it's a nice compliment,
you say the compliment.

00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:14.187
But yeah, she always is really helpful.

00:23:14.207 --> 00:23:16.688
And you know, thinking about
all the other avid members.

00:23:17.068 --> 00:23:21.013
I was really kind and it's like a big
bird that you can count on always.

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:23.696
- A big bird.
- A big bird you can count on.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:26.118
It's important to have a
big bird you can count on, so...

00:23:28.012 --> 00:23:29.693
And that's... Nerissa!

00:23:32.124 --> 00:23:33.531
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:23:33.807 --> 00:23:36.578
I wonder, Ruffians, if
your first impressions

00:23:36.602 --> 00:23:39.045
of the other Advent
members are similar to us.

00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:44.036
Let us know with the hashtag
#FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:47.612
- Now for today's new corner!
- The start of a new corner! New corner!

00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.641
It's Doggie of the Day!

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:53.084
Today we have... De-den!

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.114
We have this cutie!

00:23:56.154 --> 00:23:57.754
He's the Doggie of the Day!

00:23:57.814 --> 00:23:59.695
BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:01.576
You know, he's very strong.

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.257
Guard dog goals, I would say.

00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.678
Look at his nose, it looks so good.

00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:11.239
It looks like the PlayStation controller.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.780
The PlayStation 2 controller!

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.861
I wanna touch it.

00:24:16.181 --> 00:24:17.422
What is his name though?

00:24:17.502 --> 00:24:19.223
Should we give him a name?

00:24:19.243 --> 00:24:20.343
Let's give him a name then.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.948
He looks like a fluffy to me.

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.090
But he looks fuzzy though, like his nose.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.371
Give me a fuzzy. A fuzzy?

00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:29.612
- Fuzzies.
- A fuzzy.

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:32.697
- That's his name now. Fuzzy.
- Wait, should his name be Fluffy or Fuzzy?

00:24:33.214 --> 00:24:34.755
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:24:35.195 --> 00:24:37.136
Is he more fluffy or more fuzzy?

00:24:37.577 --> 00:24:39.638
- Fluffy or fuzzy?
- What a dog, right?

00:24:39.705 --> 00:24:41.239
- Right?
- Dog goes!

00:24:41.687 --> 00:24:42.687
Very beautiful.

00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:45.321
Fluffy? Fuzzy?

00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:47.022
Fluffy PlayStation?

00:24:47.042 --> 00:24:49.584
This is a dog, not a PlayStation.

00:24:51.937 --> 00:24:53.197
Wow, buzzy.

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:54.858
We'll call it buzzy for now.

00:24:55.038 --> 00:24:56.678
But I wonder what his bark sounds like.

00:24:56.698 --> 00:24:59.078
You know, he looks very royal.

00:24:59.216 --> 00:25:00.979
So, you think it'd be more like a roar?

00:25:01.468 --> 00:25:03.579
BAU! BAU! BAU!

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.004
- Like a BAUer?
- BAUer.

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:06.069
- A BAUer.
- Yeah.

00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:10.260
I kind of feel like it'd be maybe
a bit more like... BAU! BAU!

00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:13.481
Like a kind of like a husky softness?

00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:16.901
Oh, like a deep, a deep bork sound?

00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:18.962
A deep bork? Maybe. Maybe.

00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:20.283
Yeah.

00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:27.057
Do we give this <i>fluzzy</i> royal guard dog,

00:25:27.082 --> 00:25:29.281
Do we give them a rating?

00:25:30.474 --> 00:25:37.053
I think his rating is he's a very
good boy who loves you a lot.

00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:39.394
We have competition, Moco-chan!

00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:43.502
- Gotta do our best.
- Do our best!

00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:46.203
Thank you for the Doggie of the Day!

00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:50.724
Remember, we're always taking more
doggies of the day, so please send us some!

00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:52.385
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:56.406
And our next beginning
of another new segment.

00:25:57.367 --> 00:26:00.268
Today, I Went For a Walk.

00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:01.408
I Went <i>On</i> a Walk.

00:26:02.115 --> 00:26:03.129
On a walk.

00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:06.290
On a walk. I Went On a Walk.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.511
Well, let's see what was this walk like.

00:26:09.397 --> 00:26:11.378
Here's today's submission!

00:26:11.898 --> 00:26:14.400
This looks like a very beautiful walk.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.943
You know, all the clouds,
they look so fluffy, but

00:26:16.968 --> 00:26:21.303
The blue skies, the grass is
green, the trees are lush.

00:26:21.384 --> 00:26:23.184
Very peaceful for your heart.

00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:25.664
I hope it wasn't too hot, but you know,

00:26:25.689 --> 00:26:28.256
I think the cold tea probably
helped a lot too, right?

00:26:28.527 --> 00:26:31.749
You know, sometimes when we go
on walks, we get really, really thirsty.

00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:35.131
So sometimes as sort of
treat, we'll get one to share.

00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:37.092
Right! You know, tea is a treat.

00:26:38.232 --> 00:26:39.593
But it really is a treat.

00:26:39.693 --> 00:26:41.454
It's a treat. It's <i>tea</i>!

00:26:43.856 --> 00:26:48.478
But it's good to stay hydrated so make sure
you always drink lots and lots of water.

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:50.319
And sunscreen too!

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.580
Be like with Koicha as well.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.081
Yeah, Koicha's good!

00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:57.103
But yeah, sunscreen, and
watch out for cars, okay?

00:26:57.163 --> 00:26:58.524
Cars, yeah.

00:26:58.564 --> 00:26:59.564
Safety always.

00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:04.927
Make sure you're always making sure
that you're safe in your environment, okay?

00:27:06.628 --> 00:27:08.029
Thank you!

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.673
And next, a sudden
addition of a news segment.

00:27:12.893 --> 00:27:16.488
We have... Question of the Day!

00:27:17.907 --> 00:27:18.907
Quite a good question!

00:27:20.256 --> 00:27:27.179
Question! "Is there anything you two
would like to try when you go to Japan?"

00:27:27.898 --> 00:27:30.668
Is there anything you would
like to try when you visit Japan?

00:27:31.721 --> 00:27:34.191
- There's a lot of things.
- There's a lot of stuff, but...

00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:37.374
I think the first thing that
comes to mind though is...

00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:38.988
Wanko soba.

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:42.132
- Wanko soba!
- Do you know what wanko soba is?

00:27:42.363 --> 00:27:45.284
OK well, first, soba is buckwheat noodles.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.156
Wanko soba is like a dish
from Iwate Prefecture, but

00:27:50.181 --> 00:27:54.130
It's really just small servings
of soba noodles in your bowl,

00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:57.407
And so you eat that, and
then there's a soba keeper

00:27:57.431 --> 00:28:00.537
that will give you a new
bowl, and then you repeat.

00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:02.098
It's kind of like a bit of a race.

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:03.939
Yeah, they're smiling, right?

00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:07.231
Yeah, and Wanko soba is kind of like
a feeling, you know, it's like...

00:28:08.035 --> 00:28:10.199
You're a dog and you're
really hungry, you know,

00:28:10.224 --> 00:28:12.744
So you gotta eat fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast!

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:14.085
- Eat!
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:17.480
We've never tried wanko soba before.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.724
I guess we don't really like being watched
while eating because we get nervous.

00:28:22.924 --> 00:28:24.725
But we'll do our best to eat lots.

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:26.686
Like good puppies, okay?

00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:30.290
And then afterwards, you know, you
can count how many bowls that you eat.

00:28:30.315 --> 00:28:32.635
Yeah, you can do it with
your friends too, right?

00:28:32.866 --> 00:28:34.666
How many bowls do you
think he's eaten though?

00:28:35.974 --> 00:28:37.893
Oh, uncountable.

00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:41.275
But Ruffians, have you had soba before?

00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:43.556
Do you like udon or soba?

00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:44.717
Yeah, udon or soba.

00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:50.143
We're talking about wanko
soba, so I feel bad if I don't say

00:28:50.168 --> 00:28:52.456
- that I like soba the best, but...
- You can eat 70?

00:28:56.177 --> 00:28:57.603
- Soba?
- Soba?

00:28:57.628 --> 00:28:58.761
- Udon?
- Udon?

00:28:59.914 --> 00:29:02.567
Moco-chan, let's both say
it at the same time, okay?

00:29:05.507 --> 00:29:06.667
- Udon!
- Soba!

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.333
It's different.

00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:13.687
But I only like, I like udon
when it's really nice and chewy.

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:14.868
I like that udon too.

00:29:15.148 --> 00:29:20.271
Sometimes there's like a thin udon and then
I'm like... It's not what I was thinking.

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.571
But it's good too!

00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:23.072
Soba's good too though.

00:29:23.652 --> 00:29:25.133
Soba's one of my favorite in Japan.

00:29:25.153 --> 00:29:29.916
There's some really really
good soba places too.

00:29:30.616 --> 00:29:33.479
I like to be able to have like
fresh udon too, you know?

00:29:34.558 --> 00:29:35.820
There's lots of yummy things.

00:29:36.562 --> 00:29:37.562
But, but, but!

00:29:39.536 --> 00:29:40.794
Next! Next!

00:29:41.136 --> 00:29:44.390
Our next stream, we will be playing...

00:29:45.749 --> 00:29:48.974
Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

00:29:52.572 --> 00:29:54.493
We thought it really looked cute.

00:29:54.553 --> 00:29:56.414
It's like a cute scary, right?

00:29:56.434 --> 00:29:58.254
Yeah, we were preparing.

00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:00.715
It's a jumpscare mansion,
but you know... It's cute.

00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:04.596
That's just one kind
of form of horror, right?

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:10.378
So we opened it up and
it already jumpscared us.

00:30:10.738 --> 00:30:13.679
We had to both look away
from the screen and then...

00:30:14.239 --> 00:30:18.821
But Moco-chan was like "ahh, maybe
not now, maybe I can't do this anymore."

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:24.283
I didn't want to close off the game 'cause
I thought it was gonna jump scare me again.

00:30:24.303 --> 00:30:25.783
Yeah.

00:30:25.863 --> 00:30:27.284
When do the jump scares happen?

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.525
When do they stop?

00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:30.985
I guess that's the point
of a jump scare, right?

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:35.347
I hope it's more cute than
what I've experienced so far.

00:30:35.407 --> 00:30:39.188
Yeah. So, we'll definitely need your help.

00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:42.610
We need your help.
You better hold our paws, okay?

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.959
But even though you know it's a scary
game, we're really looking forward to it

00:30:47.984 --> 00:30:51.273
Because we want to play
a game with you so bad!

00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:52.593
We want to play a game!

00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:57.335
We've been really happy to be able
to chat lots and lots, but I feel like...

00:30:59.686 --> 00:31:03.292
We should play a game
sometime soon too, you know?

00:31:04.924 --> 00:31:08.468
We'll be playing that later today,
so we hope you'll be there, okay?

00:31:08.493 --> 00:31:09.416
Today!

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.530
- Today!
- Not tomorrow!

00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:12.774
TODAY!

00:31:13.111 --> 00:31:14.602
TODAY!

00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:16.186
Actually, Moco-chan...

00:31:17.428 --> 00:31:19.344
Can you, as a punishment,

00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:23.994
Can you say "tomorrow" in your
best Ina-senpai impersonation?

00:31:25.896 --> 00:31:26.896
Tomorrow!

00:31:28.634 --> 00:31:30.006
Tomorrow!

00:31:30.234 --> 00:31:31.975
I give it a B+.

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:33.555
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:35.716
Rate Moco-chan's "tomorrow."

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.426
But remember: Spooky's Jump
Scare Mansion is today today.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.633
- "10 out of 10!" Ooh!
- 10 out of 10!

00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:44.662
C minus?!

00:31:45.264 --> 00:31:46.308
C minus.

00:31:46.453 --> 00:31:47.960
It's good to be honest.

00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:52.642
And before we end today, let's
have another peek at our schedule.

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:53.667
How about it?

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.455
De-den! Our schedule!

00:31:57.495 --> 00:32:00.036
Don't forget, our first
Advent collab is coming up.

00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:01.776
Our first game collab.

00:32:02.376 --> 00:32:03.576
I'm really excited about it.

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:08.797
I can't wait to be able to be there
with Shiori and Bijou and Risu again.

00:32:08.837 --> 00:32:11.398
I feel like it's been too long.

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:12.978
I really miss them.

00:32:13.138 --> 00:32:15.418
We're gonna do our best
to protect all of Advent.

00:32:17.379 --> 00:32:19.839
It's gonna be a bit scary,
but we'll do our best!

00:32:20.476 --> 00:32:23.543
Actually, recently,
I've been feeling a bit...

00:32:24.382 --> 00:32:27.274
Maybe sad, maybe like... ennui?

00:32:27.638 --> 00:32:29.082
- Ennui?
- Ennui.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.969
Now that we've debuted all we...

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.056
kind of have to share the Advent
members with everyone else.

00:32:36.093 --> 00:32:38.981
And... somehow I feel
pretty complicated about this.

00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.801
I'm not really that happy about it.

00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:43.169
I don't want to share them!
I don't want to share them!

00:32:44.513 --> 00:32:45.716
It's a funny feeling.

00:32:46.017 --> 00:32:50.324
Maybe it's not the most positive
feeling, but... We have to share them now.

00:32:50.785 --> 00:32:53.510
Yeah, we're not gonna
keep them away from you.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.548
They're free.

00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:56.435
- That's okay.
- We're free.

00:32:58.448 --> 00:33:04.455
And also, we have our first karaoke
stream at FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:33:04.495 --> 00:33:06.377
It's coming up on Saturday.

00:33:06.577 --> 00:33:09.520
Are you excited with us?

00:33:09.545 --> 00:33:10.545
We're very excited.

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:11.893
I don't know if you're excited.

00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:14.606
Is there anything you
want to hear us sing?

00:33:16.075 --> 00:33:17.476
I'm always curious, you know.

00:33:17.937 --> 00:33:22.581
It's our first first Welcome Party,
so I want to make sure that it's good.

00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:25.864
Good set list.

00:33:26.168 --> 00:33:29.767
And finally, do you
notice the "???" mark?

00:33:30.469 --> 00:33:31.469
What is it?

00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:34.792
- It's a good mystery.
- It's a mystery.

00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:38.695
But you have to be there to find
out, so make sure you're there, okay?

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.233
Before we say BAU BAU for now...

00:33:44.861 --> 00:33:48.351
We'd like to shout out to some of
our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.040
Ruffians, are you ready?

00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:56.157
Kiyo Kiyo!

00:33:56.416 --> 00:33:59.198
Do your best tomorrow! BAU BAU!

00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:01.229
KSHMR!

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.311
BAU BAU!

00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:08.112
Zokko! BAU BAU!

00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:10.473
Tomshi! BAU BAU!

00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:12.974
Nino! BAU BAU!

00:34:13.276 --> 00:34:15.132
And to every other Ruffian out there,

00:34:15.348 --> 00:34:17.818
We hope you have a howl of a day!
