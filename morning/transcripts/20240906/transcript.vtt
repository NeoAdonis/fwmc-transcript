00:06:11.634 --> 00:06:12.696

Thank you so much FUWAMOCO for joining us for our 1, 2, 3 episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:31.708
BAU BAU!

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:43.594
I'm about to explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning for those of us

00:06:54.797 --> 00:07:03.080
For those that are joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.740
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.262
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:13.923
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:13.963 --> 00:07:14.324
Yeah!

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:19.525
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:24.007
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.629
BAU BAU!

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.092
Ruffians, every time there's so much hashtag, hashtag!

00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:35.573
What are you doing, Hai?

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:36.013
BAU BAU!

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:39.975
I guess it's okay, maybe.

00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:40.776
Maybe.

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:47.408
BAU BAU!

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.208
End of the week.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:50.629
End of the week?

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:52.429
Something special?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.550
Ruffians, I have a question!

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.491
What do you like to do at the end of a busy week?

00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:00.052
Wait before going into the weekend!

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:06.354
You like to curl up underneath a blanket?

00:08:06.374 --> 00:08:09.074
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:10.655
Aside from sleep.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.407
Sleep unconsciously.

00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:28.283
You like to work out?

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:29.883
That's good too!

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:30.444
Cry.

00:08:30.484 --> 00:08:30.824
Cry?

00:08:31.304 --> 00:08:32.345
That's good I guess.

00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:34.946
Sometimes it's important to cry.

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:36.427
Watch FUWAMOCO!

00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:38.668
BAU BAU!

00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:41.489
We're going into another fun weekend!

00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:42.890
BAU!

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.511
We have some bad news.

00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:47.532
I said it was gonna be a fun weekend.

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:49.473
Why does it have to stop at bad?

00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:50.674
Bad news first.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:52.535
BAU BAU.

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:56.557
There was another Pero Sighting.

00:09:03.592 --> 00:09:05.575
Okay, let's just get it over with, Moco-chan.

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:11.203
Well... Here he is.

00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:11.884
De-den!

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:21.429
He looks especially nasty here.

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:28.854
Did you eat all the ice cream you've been stockpiling through the summer and left nothing for Pero to enjoy?

00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:32.457
Is that why he looks extra nasty?

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:33.298
I think so.

00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:34.759
That's what you did, huh?

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:36.700
I guess that makes sense.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:45.327
You know, summer is how you want to eat the ice cream, but... Pero... Pero gets really nasty over sweets, okay?

00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:59.548
Maybe throw... You could throw maybe something in there for him to enjoy and then conveniently just kind of decide that now's a good time to clean out the refrigerator.

00:09:59.588 --> 00:09:59.929
Yeah!

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:01.230
Right!

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.632
Yeah, maybe throw in a pretty...

00:10:04.466 --> 00:10:05.447
And then pull the plug.

00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:13.453
It is really important to make sure that the refrigerator is all clean.

00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:17.036
That you're able to enjoy nice and fresh ice cream.

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:21.519
Even during the winter.

00:10:21.619 --> 00:10:24.762
I get kind of nasty when the ice doesn't taste very good either.

00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:31.494
A lot more nasty than Pero, yeah.

00:10:31.934 --> 00:10:32.654
Do your best.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:37.077
Make sure it's nice and clean and then you can only enjoy some good ice cream in the winter.

00:10:37.097 --> 00:10:37.597
Yeah!

00:10:38.077 --> 00:10:42.199
Good ice is important.

00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:45.261
BAU BAU!

00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:49.003
It's not quite winter, yeah.

00:10:49.864 --> 00:10:50.884
Ruffians!

00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:56.535
You know that FUWAMOCO, we've been a little busy here.

00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:57.476
But!

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:03.301
Within all of that, there's been some more voice packs released!

00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:06.263
BAU BAU!

00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:10.927
First, we have our back to school voice pack!

00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:20.895
Our back to school voice pack here, Ruffians!

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:25.100
How many Ruffians are just back to school, huh?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.741
It's kind of a rough time of year, you know?

00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:30.802
Summertime was so much fun!

00:11:30.822 --> 00:11:35.604
We did so many things, and then... Back to the books.

00:11:36.084 --> 00:11:37.644
To a new place, you know?

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:39.625
Gakusei sanshou.

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:43.907
Don't cry!

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:47.203
The training was rough too.

00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:48.264
Right!

00:11:48.304 --> 00:11:52.627
You know, if you want to go back to school, together with FUWAMOCO!

00:11:52.887 --> 00:11:53.888
This is for you!

00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:54.889
Yeah!

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:57.531
You know... You graduated already?

00:11:58.231 --> 00:11:58.672
Well!

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:01.253
If you want to experience it again.

00:12:01.274 --> 00:12:03.395
Back to school brings back!

00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:06.257
You know, maybe you could help out FUWAMOCO here!

00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:11.081
As I try to do some studying for my math, you know...

00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:12.946
Yeah.

00:12:13.506 --> 00:12:15.949
Help FUWAMOCO this school a little bit.

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:21.273
If it's with FUWAMOCO then... Why?

00:12:21.814 --> 00:12:23.095
You're just starting.

00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:24.236
Good luck!

00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:27.379
Please check it out.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:32.164
Hopefully maybe it has this alternate effect that it makes you want to even study harder.

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:32.724
Yeah.

00:12:32.844 --> 00:12:34.706
Although I'm sure you're already studying hard.

00:12:34.786 --> 00:12:35.306
I'm sure.

00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:35.727
Yeah.

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:38.098
Don't overdo it, okay?

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.678
BAU BAU!

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:49.141
And just freshly released today, we have the four types of extreme love.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:54.523
Okay, off the top of your head right now, what are the four types of love, Hoshi?

00:12:54.923 --> 00:12:55.463
What is it?

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:57.404
Tell me, explain, okay?

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:02.966
And you can't answer Koyori-senpai, Kaede-senpai, Shiori Ayame-senpai, okay?

00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:04.306
There's a lot of types of love.

00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:05.167
At least FUWAMOCO-

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:11.642
FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO Is this really the taste of love?

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:15.751
Oh!

00:13:17.312 --> 00:13:17.352
Oh!

00:13:17.653 --> 00:13:20.714
I see a lot!

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:28.959
I think you might be right!

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:34.782
BAU BAU!

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:37.003
What's your best answer then, Moco-chan?

00:13:37.443 --> 00:13:38.564
Romantic love.

00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:40.305
Familiar love.

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:41.866
Friendship love.

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:49.553
That's such a pretty action!

00:13:49.653 --> 00:13:50.314
Yeah!

00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:51.837
She is good, right!

00:13:52.138 --> 00:13:56.867
I thought about like the, what about, you know, the love that you feel towards like, your waifu.

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:00.938
Is this regular love?

00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:02.759
Does it fall into the pet love category?

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:03.739
I don't know.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.099
I think so, yes.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.680
Sounds legit, yeah!

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.360
That falls into the category.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.881
But this is extreme love.

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.501
Extreme love!

00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:18.882
What do you think FUWAMOCO could be, huh?

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:34.349
Extreme love.

00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:34.429
Wow!

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:37.770
The answer is... Yandere.

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:50.168
Here you can listen too!

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:53.310
Yandere FUWAMOCO you know.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.353
And we did our best to listen to Ruffians!

00:14:57.373 --> 00:15:03.077
Because you know your eyes, your ears, they're only FUWAMOCO's you know!

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:05.159
Please take a listen, okay?

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.961
I want to listen to ASMR.

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:09.402
No!

00:15:09.622 --> 00:15:10.743
This is Yandere!

00:15:15.927 --> 00:15:16.868
Yeah.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.630
Oh, the voice acting was really good!

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.311
Yeah, we did well!

00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:26.614
We always work really, really hard on the voice parts, so please give them a shot.

00:15:26.674 --> 00:15:37.440
I know some of our fans are surprised, but we've actually participated in every single voice part since we debuted, so... We're always doing our best!

00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:38.901
Please check it out!

00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:42.183
Fuwawa's scary, Mococo's super cute!

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:43.964
Fuwamoco's scary!

00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:46.446
FUWAMOCO is scary.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:53.148
You know them all, Bijou!

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:56.229
We're always doing our best, you know.

00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:01.331
And hopefully we can grow into even bigger grown dogs, alright?

00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:04.372
But here's some more voice parts.

00:16:04.412 --> 00:16:05.692
No, not what you want!

00:16:05.872 --> 00:16:08.353
We're talking about back to school!

00:16:08.413 --> 00:16:09.954
The yandere voice.

00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:22.821
Yeah, please give it a try someday!

00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:23.862
What is scary?

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:28.066
Why are you super cute?

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:31.850
Actually, Moco-chan's yandere is pretty rare, right?

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.331
I don't think so.

00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:34.112
No!

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.841
Yandere isn't really keeping the smile safe, but I get it!

00:16:40.982 --> 00:16:41.402
Really?

00:16:41.462 --> 00:16:42.683
It's keeping the smile safe.

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:46.484
BAU BAU!

00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:48.665
BAU BAU!

00:16:49.765 --> 00:16:53.587
Please listen, you can find it on the official hololive shop!

00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:55.448
Okay, maybe there's some Ruffians out there.

00:16:55.528 --> 00:16:57.189
Okay, but where do I go now?

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:02.591
Speaking of the hololive official shop, Ruffians!

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:04.932
Thank you so much just recently!

00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:08.234
Our first anniversary merchandise!

00:17:08.354 --> 00:17:10.316
Thank you for all your pre-orders!

00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:14.699
Pre-orders have now officially closed since then, but thank you so much!

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:18.282
I know there's a lot of Ruffians saying like, I got extra glasses!

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.604
I got extra voice keychains!

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:21.585
Thank you!

00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:25.688
I'm so excited for you to get your paws on them soon, Ruffians!

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.189
Please look forward to them!

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.052
But also right now, Ruffians!

00:17:32.453 --> 00:17:39.839
I think I've been seeing on Twitter there's some Ruffians that they've been getting their FUWAMOCO birthday merch finally!

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:41.720
Thank you for waiting a long time!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.943
I think this means that all the Ruffians everywhere have received their birthday merch!

00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:47.664
Hopefully!

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:48.965
Except no issues.

00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:56.961
But the first and most important thing is that you get your paws on the Ruffians!

00:17:57.582 --> 00:17:58.402
In a few days!

00:17:58.422 --> 00:17:59.583
Soon!

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:03.065
I'm looking forward to it!

00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:04.506
You have yours!

00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:05.647
No issues!

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.028
That was great!

00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:08.048
I'm glad, thank you!

00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:18.184
More important that it's in your paw.

00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:18.725
Yes!

00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:19.705
Yes!

00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:20.605
You have 10 Ruffians!

00:18:20.645 --> 00:18:21.945
That's a lot of Ruffians.

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:22.645
Oh my gosh.

00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:25.346
But right now Ruffians!

00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:28.926
You know there's been a lot of merchandise coming out.

00:18:29.126 --> 00:18:32.987
But right now still for pre-order is our 3D debut!

00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:34.647
3D showcase!

00:18:34.768 --> 00:18:35.468
Yeah!

00:18:35.888 --> 00:18:40.149
You know there's so many exciting things that you might have forgotten about them.

00:18:40.449 --> 00:18:42.369
They are currently still on pre-order.

00:18:42.929 --> 00:18:45.430
I'm free until September 24th.

00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:49.912
So, a few weeks from now, but please don't forget about them.

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:53.394
Especially if you want Mococo's tail keychain!

00:18:53.794 --> 00:18:57.195
It says a fluffy fabric, but I think that also means fuzzy, right?

00:18:57.315 --> 00:18:58.136
It's fuzzy, okay?

00:18:58.216 --> 00:18:59.816
It's not fluffy.

00:18:59.836 --> 00:19:00.357
Got it.

00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:04.138
Please don't miss it, Ruffians!

00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:09.661
Especially, you know, if you're working on that masterpiece FUWAMOCO Itanbei!

00:19:09.741 --> 00:19:11.322
Yeah, they'll be super duper cute!

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:12.002
And you know,

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:19.328
This is actually FUWAMOCO's brains.

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:24.152
We wanted to make this because we thought it would be cute.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.085
And then this way too, I think you know in 3D when we're here like this sometimes it's kind of hard to see our tails.

00:19:34.805 --> 00:19:42.890
But I think it kind of shows just how surprising the difference of our tails is a lot.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.634
So if you want to be reminded, maybe if you want to be able to

00:19:51.489 --> 00:19:54.291
I think I forgot to order Pokey.

00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:29.125
And if you're back at school, actually Pokey might be very good.

00:20:29.465 --> 00:20:33.988
Because Pokey is made of a pillow you can put your arms on and rest on the desk.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.531
Very, very handy.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.493
Just lock him in your locker like the cell.

00:20:41.972 --> 00:20:42.993
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:01.546
I know it's a little bit overwhelming, huh?

00:21:01.566 --> 00:21:02.146
Very overwhelming.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.901
That's right, you know.

00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:33.251
We try to share what's still available and what's maybe going away soon.

00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:35.334
We need our FUWAMOCO moichikai right!

00:21:40.202 --> 00:21:42.084
Good luck Ruffians, you know.

00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:45.386
And thank you always too.

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:46.767
Wow!

00:21:47.588 --> 00:21:49.670
For more exciting news!

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:59.498
Maybe not so related to the hololive official shop, but still exciting if you like, well, cute things.

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:00.939
Maybe singing?

00:22:02.528 --> 00:22:06.834
Bowling and video games!

00:22:07.314 --> 00:22:08.816
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:13.142
We're gonna be at FUWAMOCO Round1!

00:22:13.222 --> 00:22:14.644
BAU BAU!

00:22:17.988 --> 00:22:22.072
All Round1 locations around the USA and Japan!

00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:22.933
Yeah!

00:22:22.993 --> 00:22:25.475
That's over 50 locations in the US and over 100 in Japan!

00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:25.655
Yeah!

00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:34.444
And look right there with Ayu-senpai, Ina-senpai, Fubuki-senpai, Okayu-senpai, and Gura-senpai!

00:22:34.504 --> 00:22:35.104
Look at us!

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:37.106
We're all so cute!

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:38.227
Yeah!

00:22:39.728 --> 00:22:41.949
And this event will be starting very soon!

00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:45.551
Starting in October and running into January so... Right!

00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:46.531
It's pretty long!

00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:47.451
Right!

00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:50.793
That means that you can go all the way to Round1!

00:22:51.093 --> 00:22:51.593
Three months!

00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:53.414
FUWAMOCO Hi!

00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:57.197
Super duper cute stuff.

00:23:16.593 --> 00:23:19.315
I think your loader has around one foot.

00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:21.396
So please go and check it out.

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.698
Have FUWAMOCO done bowling before?

00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:26.119
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:27.420
Do you think we are pros?

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.961
What do you think?

00:23:29.902 --> 00:23:31.483
How do you think we do our bowling?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:38.110
Nope.

00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:38.831
Nope.

00:23:39.332 --> 00:23:45.560
I think we did a little bit better than when we played with Wasame-senpai.

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:47.662
Wasame-senpai.

00:23:47.922 --> 00:23:48.864
That was rough.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:52.468
I also almost tossed the controller at the screen.

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:55.632
But I think we did a little bit better than that.

00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:08.976
Well, if you want to challenge us at bowling, maybe Round1 might be a good place to do that, huh?

00:24:09.376 --> 00:24:15.657
Well, when it comes to singing, you know, we'd be a little bit more passionate and more confident, huh?

00:24:15.677 --> 00:24:19.258
Considering we're idols and not boys.

00:24:19.938 --> 00:24:23.219
Oh, and I think I saw a comment asking what Round1 is.

00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:28.848
Entertainment Station.

00:24:29.268 --> 00:24:30.148
Velvet Boy.

00:24:30.348 --> 00:24:31.189
Arcade Games.

00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:32.049
Howl Gear.

00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:34.210
Super duper fun!

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.552
So please go ahead and head over to the nearest Round1 to check it out.

00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:39.973
Starting October 11th!

00:24:40.053 --> 00:24:41.453
Yeah, not too early.

00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:43.154
Don't get too excited quite yet.

00:24:43.574 --> 00:24:48.637
Please look forward to more FUWAMOCO!

00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:49.717
BAU BAU!

00:24:53.496 --> 00:24:57.038
Well, you know, now it's officially September.

00:24:57.718 --> 00:25:00.820
And well, summer is sort of starting to end.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.420
Yeah.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.062
Obviously had a bunch of things going on, you know.

00:25:05.082 --> 00:25:09.385
Our first anniversary, our 3D debuts, Breaking Dementia!

00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:09.925
But also!

00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:15.412
Also, there was the whole summer bingo!

00:25:15.792 --> 00:25:18.837
Bingo!

00:25:19.337 --> 00:25:20.018
Yeah!

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:22.401
You know, Ruffians!

00:25:22.502 --> 00:25:25.846
There was maybe a FUWAMOCO Morning and that was a little bit funny.

00:25:26.987 --> 00:25:30.570
Uh, a bunch of different things, you know, but... She's a bit flirty!

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.550
We did our best!

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.693
We participated in the holosummer bingo for the very first time!

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:38.014
We filled out the normal bingo sheet.

00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:40.095
We did the infernal bingo!

00:25:40.316 --> 00:25:41.596
We did everything!

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:43.157
We completed it all!

00:25:43.177 --> 00:25:43.317
Yes!

00:25:43.337 --> 00:25:44.738
We played a prank on Biboo!

00:25:44.758 --> 00:25:45.018
Yup!

00:25:45.319 --> 00:25:45.539
Yup!

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:46.339
We ate bugs.

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:47.580
We made her eat bugs.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.541
There's a lot of bugs.

00:25:48.641 --> 00:25:49.962
We had a FUWAMOCO maid cafe!

00:25:50.002 --> 00:25:51.202
We caught bugs!

00:25:51.242 --> 00:25:51.903
Yeah!

00:25:51.923 --> 00:25:54.905
Uh, you know we did everything and anything!

00:25:55.828 --> 00:25:58.791
We had very good luck.

00:25:58.811 --> 00:26:03.275
More than anything, Ruffians, we hope you had a fun time together with us.

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:16.257
On the left paw.

00:26:16.697 --> 00:26:17.337
Wow.

00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:18.918
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:19.278 --> 00:26:24.501
We happen to be the only hololive members that completed all their bingos.

00:26:24.602 --> 00:26:25.302
Both bingos.

00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:26.923
The Inferno bingo too.

00:26:28.144 --> 00:26:32.046
And didn't win a single prize.

00:26:32.146 --> 00:26:33.066
Not even close.

00:26:33.106 --> 00:26:36.188
Not many members completed everything.

00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:39.010
So I think we should have... What's the word?

00:26:40.817 --> 00:26:41.298
No.

00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:41.798
Pity?

00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:41.858
No.

00:26:42.379 --> 00:26:44.541
We've definitely been pity.

00:26:45.902 --> 00:26:47.604
We should hold our heads high!

00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:48.645
We did it all!

00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:49.305
Yeah!

00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:50.547
You know!

00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:55.091
Just in for FUWAMOCO's consolation prize!

00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:55.171
Wow!

00:26:55.492 --> 00:27:02.659
We will definitely be enjoying our bunch of eye-warmers, face masks, bath salts!

00:27:03.139 --> 00:27:03.680
Yeah!

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.861
But more than that, you know, Ruffians, it's not about winning prizes.

00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:10.002
We weren't doing it to win prizes.

00:27:10.022 --> 00:27:11.882
We weren't doing it to have fun.

00:27:12.142 --> 00:27:13.343
You know?

00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:22.045
So, I think you know, I know, Marine-senpai, Senpai, Poruru-oneechan, they're like, how FUWAMOCO I feel so bad for them!

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:24.586
But, that's not why we are doing it.

00:27:24.626 --> 00:27:27.127
We're doing it for the memories, the journey.

00:27:27.367 --> 00:27:28.587
You know?

00:27:28.707 --> 00:27:30.668
So... We wanted to do it together.

00:27:30.828 --> 00:27:31.128
Yeah.

00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:35.010
And I think we're able to do just that, Ruffians!

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:41.413
So we're gonna enjoy the consolation prizes that I think are very amazing.

00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:45.996
You know, Brighton used the eye masks all the time too!

00:27:46.056 --> 00:27:47.117
Bath salts too!

00:27:47.137 --> 00:27:48.497
Special ones!

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.211
You know we're gonna enjoy those!

00:27:52.572 --> 00:27:54.533
Enjoy the memories we made all together!

00:27:54.674 --> 00:27:58.157
And we're gonna do our best next year too!

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:00.359
Next year's hololive summer big!

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:02.701
Maybe we didn't have luck this time.

00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:07.225
But maybe that just means the luck is waiting for us in other ways.

00:28:07.765 --> 00:28:10.908
So in case stuff like this happens, it's okay.

00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:12.610
It'll come around.

00:28:14.231 --> 00:28:16.794
BAU BAU!

00:28:17.174 --> 00:28:18.776
Yeah, we're just charging up the luck.

00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:20.958
Exactly.

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.441
BAU BAU!

00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:29.307
Another really happy day happened, Ruffians!

00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:35.491
You know how we just released our original song, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★, right?

00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:36.612
Right, right, right.

00:28:36.832 --> 00:28:38.454
You listened to it, right?

00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:39.835
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:28:39.915 --> 00:28:44.058
It just recently got over 500,000 listens on YouTube here.

00:28:44.398 --> 00:28:46.139
If you haven't checked it out, please check it out.

00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:47.240
And it's very cute.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.601
It's also on Spotify.

00:28:48.941 --> 00:28:49.141
But!

00:28:50.322 --> 00:28:57.771
Now, you can also sing Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★ at Karaoke!

00:28:57.932 --> 00:29:01.175
"BAU"DOL is now in Joysound Karaoke!

00:29:01.396 --> 00:29:03.438
And also there, oh I see something else.

00:29:03.478 --> 00:29:04.540
hololive English -Advent-.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.183
Sirens as well!

00:29:08.624 --> 00:29:11.646
As well as Mikocchi-san.

00:29:12.147 --> 00:29:15.850
But you know, we always really wanted to have a song at Karaoke!

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:22.736
And now this means that Ruffians, when you go to Karaoke, or maybe when you come to Japan, you're like, I'm gonna go to Karaoke!

00:29:23.336 --> 00:29:26.158
You can go at the same point, and we bottle up!

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.801
Yeah, heck yeah!

00:29:30.821 --> 00:29:32.381
Heck yeah!

00:29:32.942 --> 00:29:35.662
Make sure though that you request Joy-san.

00:29:36.063 --> 00:29:41.805
Some places have multiple systems, so make sure if you're going to karaoke that it's Joy-san.

00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:42.685
Joy-san!

00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:46.206
Don't wait for sure, you can BAU BAU lots of those.

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:47.126
Yes!

00:29:47.246 --> 00:29:47.646
Yeah.

00:29:50.027 --> 00:29:51.268
I love going to karaoke.

00:29:51.348 --> 00:29:53.049
It's so much fun!

00:29:53.409 --> 00:29:57.351
It's been a little while, but the last time we went was pretty memorable.

00:29:58.351 --> 00:30:01.013
We went with some hololive English members.

00:30:06.175 --> 00:30:08.096
Yeah, you can be a FUWAMOCO at karaoke!

00:30:08.216 --> 00:30:09.056
Exactly!

00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:10.117
Exactly!

00:30:10.317 --> 00:30:11.497
Too embarrassing!

00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.718
Okay, you sing Mococo's part, okay?

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:14.958
Not too embarrassing!

00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:17.779
Too much fun, okay?

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:21.221
Don't let embarrassment keep you from having fun, okay?

00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:23.281
It's important.

00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:23.681
Yeah.

00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:25.142
I don't know, that's...

00:30:26.465 --> 00:30:29.007
That's not how I want to live my life, you know?

00:30:30.608 --> 00:30:33.190
Let's live the best life we can, FUWAMOCO.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.331
Without regrets, okay?

00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:35.472
No regrets.

00:30:36.312 --> 00:30:36.792
BAU BAU!

00:30:38.458 --> 00:30:48.948
You can sing it all yourself, so... That might be kind of tricky, but... You can do it!

00:30:49.469 --> 00:30:50.730
The FUWAMOCO Challenge.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.091
Mama!

00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:52.972
Mama!

00:30:53.032 --> 00:30:53.412
Wow!

00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:56.355
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today!

00:30:56.455 --> 00:30:59.638
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:02.579
It's Enzo!

00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:07.562
He's so cute and happy puppy!

00:31:08.282 --> 00:31:15.086
Enzo reminds me of me because he's so fluffy and active and happy!

00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:16.346
BAU BAU!

00:31:16.406 --> 00:31:16.967
I'm honored!

00:31:22.069 --> 00:31:26.251
I hope Enzo stays fluffy and happy forever and ever.

00:31:26.271 --> 00:31:27.812
She looks a bit fuzzy though, huh?

00:31:28.372 --> 00:31:30.633
Moco-chan, you feel a little bit left out?

00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:33.694
Look, it's his team expression.

00:31:35.855 --> 00:31:36.916
Let's see.

00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:43.019
Wow!

00:31:43.179 --> 00:31:43.879
I'm Enzo!

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:44.819
Yeah!

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.621
How does Enzo BAU BAU?

00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:50.522
It looks sort of like...

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:52.961
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:32:05.293 --> 00:32:07.796
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:32:07.976 --> 00:32:11.078
I think we can all tell, but Enzo!

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:15.102
Enzo's the best puppy you could ever wish for.

00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:18.005
I know, you can see here he's always happy.

00:32:18.025 --> 00:32:20.807
He loves to make you happy too.

00:32:20.827 --> 00:32:24.531
I think life is really exciting for him.

00:32:26.552 --> 00:32:27.653
Look!

00:32:27.773 --> 00:32:29.094
He's like, yes!

00:32:29.274 --> 00:32:30.515
Today is exciting!

00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:32.436
Today is Friday!

00:32:32.556 --> 00:32:32.936
Yes!

00:32:33.497 --> 00:32:34.857
Tomorrow is Saturday.

00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:35.798
Yes!

00:32:36.078 --> 00:32:38.400
And we're gonna go for walks every day.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.480
Yes!

00:32:39.881 --> 00:32:40.221
Yeah.

00:32:40.721 --> 00:32:47.005
But more than anything, Enzo just can't wait to spend every day together with you.

00:32:48.126 --> 00:32:52.348
And also, very important, Enzo's very fluffy.

00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:53.249
Super fluffy.

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:54.950
And I think that's super great.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.251
BAU BAU!

00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:01.051
He does look like he just heard some good news.

00:33:01.151 --> 00:33:02.212
Why?

00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.612
That's Enzo every day, all the time.

00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:08.293
The good news is that he sees you in front of him.

00:33:09.314 --> 00:33:12.014
BAU BAU!

00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:14.415
For today, I went on a walk.

00:33:14.455 --> 00:33:16.015
We have... De-den!

00:33:20.217 --> 00:33:23.441
That's a perfect FUWAMOCO sky.

00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:26.944
Yeah, with the Ruffians too!

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:33.030
We're so happy to hear that you got up for a good walk nice and early in the day.

00:33:33.271 --> 00:33:37.755
Exercise right after you wake up is always really good for you.

00:33:37.996 --> 00:33:40.778
The Ruffians along with you.

00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:42.260
It's good to have company.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.041
It has been so much fun.

00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:48.943
I can just smell the cool air.

00:33:49.043 --> 00:33:50.923
I can feel it on my skin.

00:33:51.483 --> 00:33:53.184
I hope you had a wonderful time!

00:33:53.224 --> 00:33:55.445
Thank you for sharing!

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:56.545
Thank you!

00:33:56.585 --> 00:33:58.426
BAU BAU!

00:33:58.826 --> 00:34:02.748
And next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:34:03.828 --> 00:34:03.968
Oh!

00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:06.309
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:34:06.749 --> 00:34:12.450
After you open pre-chat, what are you usually doing during that time before stream?

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.271
Getting more homework done?

00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:15.851
Taking a quick nap?

00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:18.472
Watching pre-chat shenanigans?

00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:20.873
Or maybe something else?

00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:25.054
We are go-go-going still.

00:34:25.074 --> 00:34:28.755
Yeah, you know, getting everything prepared.

00:34:29.155 --> 00:34:30.475
Our Barker's getting

00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:31.575
Wake up!

00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:35.576
Grabbing tea and responding to anything from Morning Chat.

00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:37.677
Every single moment is accounted for.

00:34:38.137 --> 00:34:38.838
Every minute.

00:34:39.598 --> 00:34:40.758
Definitely no naps!

00:34:40.898 --> 00:34:41.778
No time for that!

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:42.339
No!

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:47.020
It takes a lot of time to prepare for things.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.922
I think, you know Ruffians, it's kinda hard to understand unless you do it yourself.

00:34:55.023 --> 00:34:58.524
But we're always doing our best and that does take time.

00:35:00.472 --> 00:35:06.956
So for us, the last hour before stream, it's never ever just relaxed free time.

00:35:07.596 --> 00:35:07.817
No.

00:35:08.077 --> 00:35:08.357
No.

00:35:08.637 --> 00:35:09.017
Yeah.

00:35:09.438 --> 00:35:13.360
It'll be nice, but... No, at that point we are mad dashing.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.321
Yeah.

00:35:16.662 --> 00:35:19.084
Every last moment, every last second.

00:35:19.104 --> 00:35:21.205
We know by what minute what needs to be done.

00:35:22.846 --> 00:35:23.086
Yeah.

00:35:24.007 --> 00:35:25.868
And if not... Yeah.

00:35:29.507 --> 00:35:34.148
No Ruffians, thank you for always being here!

00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:36.929
We're happy to be able to share your mornings with you!

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:38.709
BAU BAU!

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:42.010
I'm Ruffians!

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:47.551
I want to say another big thank you so much for all your submissions!

00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:55.172
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING right at the top there to send us your questions!

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:57.373
Your Pero Sightings if you see him.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.802
Being nasty or grumpy.

00:35:59.822 --> 00:36:01.563
Finish your walks.

00:36:02.184 --> 00:36:05.266
And you know, you're Doggie of the Day too!

00:36:05.467 --> 00:36:07.128
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:07.228 --> 00:36:08.730
BAU BAU!

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.633
And for our next theme, we have... De-den!

00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:13.414
Day 7!

00:36:13.454 --> 00:36:13.614
Day 7!

00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:14.455
Of Earth 6?

00:36:17.547 --> 00:36:23.093
Seven Numbers of ENigmatic Recollection!

00:36:23.193 --> 00:36:28.059
We're reaching, you know, the end of ENigmatic Recollection.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.642
The grand finale is within sight!

00:36:31.242 --> 00:36:34.986
And I think there's even more crazy things going on!

00:36:35.006 --> 00:36:37.209
Maybe like you were saying, shonan again.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:41.932
We'll see just what's going on next in ENigmatic Recollection!

00:36:41.952 --> 00:36:42.692
BAU BAU!

00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:46.054
Time for our schedule!

00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:48.555
The big finale is on Saturday!

00:36:48.575 --> 00:36:51.377
Saturday at 7pm PT.

00:36:51.417 --> 00:36:59.481
But after that, on Sunday, we're gonna go take a look and watch all day 1 and day 2 of Breaking the Mansions!

00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:00.682
So Ruffians!

00:37:01.242 --> 00:37:02.803
Maybe get some popcorn!

00:37:03.123 --> 00:37:04.684
Maybe some ice cream!

00:37:04.704 --> 00:37:05.845
Penlight!

00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:08.326
Apple because it's at the Big Apple!

00:37:08.346 --> 00:37:10.708
And also your streaming ticket!

00:37:11.148 --> 00:37:12.909
And let's re-enjoy!

00:37:13.209 --> 00:37:13.750
Re-break!

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.691
The dimensions!

00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.532
And let's break the dimensions all together!

00:37:18.552 --> 00:37:23.595
We'll have lots of secrets!

00:37:24.156 --> 00:37:25.296
We have a lot to say!

00:37:25.316 --> 00:37:27.518
A lot to talk about!

00:37:27.538 --> 00:37:29.079
And we might get a little emotional.

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:34.705
BAU BAU!

00:37:35.005 --> 00:37:38.369
Fuwawafians are joining us today through the Archive!

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.152
Here is your FUWAMOCO list!

00:37:41.713 --> 00:37:44.116
It's BAU BAU yagere!

00:37:44.296 --> 00:37:46.518
BAU BAU!

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.380
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.022
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:54.342 --> 00:38:01.264
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:38:01.624 --> 00:38:02.805
Dear BAU BAU!

00:38:03.725 --> 00:38:06.807
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

00:38:24.237 --> 00:38:32.200
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.121
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
