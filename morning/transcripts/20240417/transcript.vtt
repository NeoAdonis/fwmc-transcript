00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.640
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:13.775
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.440
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.900
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.419
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.281
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.162
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:30.783
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:31.384 --> 00:05:35.946
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.488
Take care, Ruffians!

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:39.568
You're awake?

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.150
You're awake today!

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.170
Maybe not before.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.931
Just barely.

00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:43.992
But you're awake!

00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:49.215
Thank you for joining us today for our 86th episode!

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:51.177
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:53.418
You did it, Mofu!

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:54.719
You're sleepy.

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:55.500
Barely awake.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.401
Well, FUWAMOCO!

00:05:57.762 --> 00:05:58.882
FUWAMOCO report!

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:04.727
FUWAMOCO is not sleepy, but we're at the point where we're extra silly.

00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:10.945
So this is what FUWAMOCO Morning is gonna be from now on, right?

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:11.766
Yeah.

00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:14.789
That's the time of day.

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:27.840
You know, with FUWAMOCO Morning being back, I see a lot of new Ruffians, new face Ruffians.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.761
So!

00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:34.411
Old face Ruffians.

00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:36.753
Yeah, the old face Ruffians too.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:49.425
For those that are joining us maybe for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:50.185
A.K.A.

00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:50.686
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:52.668
And it's hosted by us.

00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:55.209
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.214
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.858
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:10.259
Not FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.782
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:17.304
BAU BAU!

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:26.449
BAU BAU!

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.590
Take care of you.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.391
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:35.871
It's the Wednesday episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:36.552 --> 00:07:38.352
And that means... What?

00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:44.634
There's been... Another Pero Sighting!

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:51.935
I don't... I don't know how to feel because... Ruffians!

00:07:52.256 --> 00:07:55.238
Ruffians are happy when Pero's around.

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:57.259
Doesn't look like it today.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:00.822
I'm happy when... Ruffians are happy.

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:01.302
Well...

00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:05.129
Maybe not today, but!

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:06.250
Where was he spotted?

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.531
De-den!

00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:08.532
Oh!

00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:09.332
Oh!

00:08:09.352 --> 00:08:15.337
This was during an eclipse that happened a little while ago.

00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:17.439
Did you get to see a Ruffian?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.421
Yeah.

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.984
FUWAMOCO.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:24.725
We didn't.

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:29.209
But, you know, that's okay because we don't really know too much about them.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:30.169
Yeah.

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:35.573
Going by this sighting, Pero is what causes them.

00:08:37.894 --> 00:08:45.277
Well, if he's the one that's in charge of them, then, you know, it's nice that he returns the world back to normal.

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:46.238
Mine's true.

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:59.563
Actually, you know, I wasn't so sure about eclipses, so I searched it up, and apparently it's the total or partial obscuring of one celestial body by another.

00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:03.521
Ruffians.

00:09:04.662 --> 00:09:07.463
Does that mean that Pero is a celestial body?

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:14.266
He is round and moonish, right?

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:20.929
Pero is celestial!

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:23.650
Pero has a celestial body!

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:34.333
Well, we're glad to be able to enjoy the especially unique eclipse.

00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:35.413
Yeah.

00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:36.733
Yeah.

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:39.154
BAU BAU!

00:09:39.174 --> 00:09:40.034
Well, Mofi.

00:09:40.074 --> 00:09:42.814
You might have saw.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:46.115
You might have been asleep too.

00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:47.135
You might have been asleep.

00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:47.995
That's the problem.

00:09:48.015 --> 00:09:48.996
You shouldn't have seen.

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.716
No, I should have been close.

00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:51.876
No, no, yes.

00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:54.437
But it was just announced.

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:55.917
FUWAMOCO.

00:09:57.017 --> 00:10:05.504
We're gonna be guests on the official hololive channel with Nodoka-san for this special Houno Kyuujitsu show!

00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:10.267
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:12.289
I'm super duper excited for it!

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:14.170
Right now, Ruffians!

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.731
Actually, we're taking suggestions and ideas for the show through the whole plus app!

00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:28.414
So if you have anything cool that you think we could do or maybe Nodoka-san could ask us, please don't hesitate!

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:33.836
Unfortunately though, we can't access the app from outside of Japan right now.

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:34.716
But!

00:10:35.196 --> 00:10:35.396
But!

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:41.258
There may be a few JP Ruffians who are willing to help out and we know you can submit

00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:44.899
We can submit your ideas for you!

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:47.281
Teamwork!

00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.841
Teamwork, right!

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:54.964
It's just a big plan to bring the Ruffians all together.

00:10:56.545 --> 00:11:00.506
Thank you for being so kind to each other!

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:07.049
And you know, FUWAMOCO, we're really looking forward to having a bunch of fun on the official channel!

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.751
Chat lots with Nodoka-san for the first time too!

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.112
Oh, you requested!

00:11:15.312 --> 00:11:17.273
BAU BAU!

00:11:17.393 --> 00:11:18.633
TQ!

00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:22.435
Ruffians, fly to Japan to make suggestions!

00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:26.082
Really?

00:11:26.782 --> 00:11:27.963
You're being silly, okay?

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:30.784
Just half the weight, maybe.

00:11:30.884 --> 00:11:31.764
Yeah.

00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:32.245
Oh!

00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:34.345
Good things take a little bit of time, right?

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:35.346
Right.

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:37.927
BAU BAU!

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:39.868
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.129
We hope that you can watch too!

00:11:42.249 --> 00:11:43.570
What exciting stuff!

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.951
And, well, Ruffians.

00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:47.771
Okay.

00:11:48.712 --> 00:11:50.212
Do you remember that

00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:53.937
February!

00:11:53.957 --> 00:11:57.802
There was a big collab that we had!

00:11:58.743 --> 00:12:02.428
February is so long ago now, right Moco-chan?

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:04.351
It feels like it.

00:12:06.714 --> 00:12:07.876
Oh, you do, you do!

00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:11.114
What was it though?

00:12:11.434 --> 00:12:13.395
Yeah!

00:12:13.475 --> 00:12:14.455
That's right!

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:23.860
We had a karaoke collab with hololive's Chloe-sama and we released a cover of BABYMETAL's Gimme Choco!

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.920
Gimme Choco!

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.921
Gimme Choco BAU!

00:12:27.001 --> 00:12:29.242
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:36.666
Yeah, it was a lot of fun being able to sing a bunch of songs together with her.

00:12:37.226 --> 00:12:37.546
Yeah.

00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.227
I know.

00:12:39.447 --> 00:12:44.090
The cover song is over on Chloe-senpai's channel, so you might have missed it.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:44.550
Yeah.

00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:47.951
Maybe not!

00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:51.153
Because it just hit 1 million views!

00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:51.713
BAU BAU!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:55.375
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:12:55.395 --> 00:12:58.657
1 million views!

00:12:59.257 --> 00:13:00.818
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:01.858
BAU BAU!

00:13:01.878 --> 00:13:10.883
It's kind of crazy to think, you know, we've only been debut for 8 months, but in that time we've already covered 2 BABYMETAL songs!

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:12.832
BAU BAU!

00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:13.832
Thank you!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.377
Lots of exciting things happening!

00:13:46.837 --> 00:13:48.738
And, well, Ruffians!

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:55.943
Maybe, you know, we haven't been talking about it a lot or anything, right?

00:13:56.984 --> 00:13:58.925
It's okay if you don't know, though.

00:13:58.985 --> 00:13:59.786
Don't feel bad.

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:06.350
Well, you might know, but FUWAMOCO are now officially in our new doghouse in Japan here!

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.754
We got two amazing computer monitors from HyperX!

00:14:10.794 --> 00:14:11.194
BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:11.234 --> 00:14:12.255
Thank you!

00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:28.691
That's one for each of us Ruffians!

00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:33.734
So now our studio looks very professional, very sleek.

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:37.596
And they're so beautiful!

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.937
It's almost like a mirror.

00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:41.378
A black mirror.

00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:43.860
Yeah, when you turn it off you can see yourself!

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.122
My ears look nice too.

00:14:48.362 --> 00:14:51.304
I look extra fluffy.

00:14:51.684 --> 00:14:55.707
But you know, even though I have my own monitor,

00:14:56.877 --> 00:14:57.738
It's my own mod.

00:14:58.078 --> 00:14:58.458
It is.

00:14:58.858 --> 00:15:05.202
That just means I can poke and point and make all the fingerprints I want on it, right?

00:15:05.662 --> 00:15:06.783
Right, Ruffians?

00:15:07.804 --> 00:15:08.684
Not touchscreen.

00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:11.146
But I put the touch in touchscreen.

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:14.828
Yeah.

00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:16.569
Yeah.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.590
If you touch it enough, it's touchscreen.

00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:19.131
Yeah.

00:15:20.396 --> 00:15:21.858
I can't disagree with that.

00:15:23.319 --> 00:15:26.022
I don't know, I think... Don't touch!

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:26.842
Use gloves!

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:33.929
I think we should keep these ones nice and... And maybe... Fingerprint free even.

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:36.972
Moco-chan, I have a good strategy for that.

00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:39.715
You know the best way to keep things fingerprint clean?

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:40.876
What?

00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:41.877
Fingerprint free!

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.879
You know, is it to clean them?

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:47.800
No.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.241
It's for you to clean them.

00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:53.943
BAU BAU!

00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:56.425
BAU BAU!

00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:58.806
Thank you so much!

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:00.127
Thank you!

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:04.289
We might not have beds or a table yet, but we'll be okay.

00:16:04.789 --> 00:16:06.891
Cause we have these awesome monitors!

00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:07.891
BAU BAU!

00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:09.672
BAU BAU!

00:16:11.273 --> 00:16:12.594
No, Fuwawa, you clean!

00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:14.977
How about you clean something, huh?

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:17.539
BAU BAU!

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:23.304
Thank you!

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:29.169
You know, there's been a lot of milestones recently.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.011
And today, Ruffians,

00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:33.381
Another thing!

00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:35.502
Another great thing happened!

00:16:35.542 --> 00:16:37.183
I think this counts as a milestone.

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:38.183
It's a milestone.

00:16:38.343 --> 00:16:39.624
It definitely is.

00:16:39.664 --> 00:16:40.084
Yeah.

00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:45.586
You know, it's actually a milestone that you've been asking about quite a bit.

00:16:45.746 --> 00:16:46.246
A what?

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:47.507
Yeah, right.

00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:48.227
Huh.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:49.607
Oh?

00:16:49.928 --> 00:16:50.748
Wow!

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:53.509
Oh?

00:16:54.557 --> 00:16:58.420
We met our first JP-senpai at the studio!

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.582
BAU BAU!

00:17:00.682 --> 00:17:01.483
Yeah!

00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:05.146
Yeah, and it was just purely coincidence.

00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:11.692
But, can you guess who we ran into?

00:17:13.193 --> 00:17:17.757
Who was JP-senpai?

00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:22.707
I saw it!

00:17:22.727 --> 00:17:23.367
Ruffians!

00:17:23.468 --> 00:17:24.549
It was Fubuki-senpai!

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:24.789
BAU BAU!

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.012
Fubuki-senpai!

00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:40.126
Amazing, huh?

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:43.508
We were so so so happy to see her.

00:17:43.528 --> 00:17:46.490
She was so cute and fluffy looking.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:53.814
She was so cute and she just popped out from the corner of the door frame and was like, FUWAMOCO-CHAN!

00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:59.237
You know, and Fubuki-senpai was also the first JP-senpai we collaborated with.

00:17:59.777 --> 00:18:02.879
And she's always so nice and kind to us, so...

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.100
We are just so happy.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.101
Yeah, a lot of FUWAMOCO's first time with Fubuki-senpai.

00:18:11.342 --> 00:18:19.184
We really hope that we can learn even more from Fubuki-senpai because we really admire her.

00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.364
Amazing!

00:18:20.404 --> 00:18:27.206
We feel really lucky to play with our canine family.

00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:28.507
Can you touch me?

00:18:29.407 --> 00:18:29.967
You can.

00:18:30.548 --> 00:18:31.608
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:18:38.927 --> 00:18:42.229
BAU BAU!

00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:44.891
I know Fubuki-senpai!

00:18:44.931 --> 00:18:48.192
She's been playing lots of Lethal Company recently.

00:18:48.673 --> 00:18:49.753
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:57.257
It was so much fun playing all together with Koyori-senpai playing Lethal Company!

00:18:58.918 --> 00:19:00.419
Yo, she's addicted y'all.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.360
That's okay, we understand too.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:27.050
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:37.869
You know, I'd like to think that, you know, FUWAMOCO, we're pretty straightforward and easy to understand.

00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:52.041
But... I guess with how many times we've had this corner, that wouldn't be too hard.

00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:53.162
Yeah.

00:19:53.863 --> 00:19:55.084
Ruffians!

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:02.563
There's been another misunderstanding.

00:20:02.923 --> 00:20:08.845
You know how we talked about the Cheesecake Scam last FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:09.866
Right!

00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:18.950
Well, it looks like quite a lot of JP Ruffians are worried and apologetic about the whole situation.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.931
There's quite a lot of comments!

00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:33.023
Yeah, uh, in case you didn't hear, Moco-chan fell prey to the clutches of a good sales lady pushing her fancy and expensive cheesecakes.

00:20:33.363 --> 00:20:42.367
What I wanted was really, I just, I just wanted a place to hide in the rain while we waited for Mighty-chan and, you know, a cheesecake to share while we waited even if it was a bit expensive.

00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:46.089
It didn't sound too bad, you know, but we ended up with two

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:46.609
BAU BAU!

00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:11.608
She was just really excited.

00:21:11.628 --> 00:21:15.454
And she just wanted to promote the cafe's takeout menu.

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.897
I don't think people knew about it.

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:19.419
She's passionate about it.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:25.673
There wasn't many people around and she was probably just happy to have us stop right beside her.

00:21:25.733 --> 00:21:26.193
You know what?

00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:28.013
Ruffians!

00:21:28.794 --> 00:21:29.734
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:34.815
We don't just go around with our ears and tails in plain sight, okay?

00:21:35.115 --> 00:21:38.575
So she wasn't picking on us or taking advantage of us, okay?

00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:40.296
She meant well, I'm sure of it.

00:21:40.616 --> 00:21:42.856
She was just very excited and pushy.

00:21:43.496 --> 00:21:44.756
And we were pushover pups.

00:21:45.477 --> 00:21:46.997
Moco-chan was a pushover pup.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:48.191
Wee.

00:21:48.651 --> 00:22:01.358
Anyways, Abyss, do you really think though, out of all discounts, someone would choose to pull that a cheesecake one would be a good idea?

00:22:01.378 --> 00:22:01.438
Huh?

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:07.500
We can think of better options, right?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:15.004
Like if you want to discount people out of money, I don't think you would start up a fancy cafe selling cheesecake, right?

00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:16.585
You'd do something a lot more

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:20.947
Scary.

00:22:21.828 --> 00:22:23.550
Scary!

00:22:23.871 --> 00:22:26.174
It went through the eyes!

00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:35.526
You can't think of anything better, huh?

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:38.187
The ring scam.

00:22:38.908 --> 00:22:44.329
Oh, like the one where you give it to FUWAMOCO, and then FUWAMOCO eats it, and they're happy.

00:22:44.389 --> 00:22:44.870
That one?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.610
That's the scam.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.630
Yeah.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.090
Huh?

00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:56.533
Actually, Moco-chan, I'm happy because I asked the Ruffians, can you come up with a better option?

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.832
That means that the Ruffians have never thought of such a thing.

00:23:03.152 --> 00:23:07.415
Which is good because we were trying to think of other puns.

00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:11.138
But we couldn't think of anything.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.521
No.

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:16.161
That's good.

00:23:16.502 --> 00:23:18.263
It's good, yeah.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:22.266
We've fallen for much worse than a cheesecake scam before anyways, so.

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:23.046
BAU BAU!

00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:37.302
Moco-chan!

00:23:37.763 --> 00:23:39.184
It's the middle of the week.

00:23:39.784 --> 00:23:40.965
It's Wednesday.

00:23:41.225 --> 00:23:43.106
I don't like Wednesdays.

00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:44.668
Really?

00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:45.848
Yeah, and you know what?

00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:54.655
Wednesday starts with a W. And also, I think the Ruffians, they might have been waiting.

00:23:58.647 --> 00:23:59.247
What for?

00:24:01.128 --> 00:24:01.848
It's Wednesday.

00:24:02.468 --> 00:24:03.909
It's okay, I'm just joking.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.410
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:09.490
Hi!

00:24:09.671 --> 00:24:14.232
Can you give us a little bit more pop to get through the week?

00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:20.354
Ruffians!

00:24:21.774 --> 00:24:24.635
It's been a while, hi!

00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:24.755
Hi.

00:24:25.556 --> 00:24:26.516
How've you been good?

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.020
Huh?

00:24:29.021 --> 00:24:31.063
I know things have been rough, you know.

00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:36.827
No FUWAMOCO Morning, no Pup Talks, no regular streams.

00:24:37.808 --> 00:24:39.169
It's been strange, right?

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.692
Maybe the BAU BAU of y'all slayed up a bit.

00:24:44.713 --> 00:24:44.913
Hm?

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.221
But you know what?

00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:50.223
Despite it all, you powered through!

00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:52.925
You're stronger than you think you are, okay?

00:24:54.186 --> 00:24:55.507
I know, change is rough.

00:24:56.067 --> 00:25:00.731
But sometimes, the momentary discomfort of change is worth the outcome.

00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:01.231
Boom.

00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:04.373
And now, things are already better, right?

00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:05.834
Even if just a bit.

00:25:05.874 --> 00:25:05.934
And!

00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:12.129
You can do it again!

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.253
You can overcome anything else in your way, even if it's a bit scary, okay?

00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:26.661
Just like before, it might be rough, it might be uncomfy, but eventually, it'll be over and as good as before!

00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:30.344
Even better, okay?

00:25:31.004 --> 00:25:32.906
And this time, you'll be stronger.

00:25:35.037 --> 00:25:43.704
I mean, you're already super strong, but I'm looking forward to seeing the super duper strong you that's just waiting around the corner.

00:25:44.484 --> 00:25:46.626
And I'll work on getting stronger too, okay?

00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:48.207
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:48.988 --> 00:25:50.108
Let's do it together!

00:25:50.128 --> 00:25:51.369
Ganbatte de!

00:25:51.429 --> 00:25:52.590
BAU BAU!

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:59.739
BAU BAU!

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.125
It's the middle of the week, but the week has also just started.

00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:07.469
So, let's all do our best!

00:26:07.569 --> 00:26:09.151
BAU BAU!

00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:10.933
Well, next, Moco-chan!

00:26:11.894 --> 00:26:14.698
Let's take a look at who the Doggie of the Day is today.

00:26:14.718 --> 00:26:20.265
Our Doggie of the Day is... That is Bud!

00:26:20.486 --> 00:26:22.308
BAU BAU!

00:26:22.408 --> 00:26:27.835
I'm silly Bud just turned 8 a little while ago.

00:26:28.576 --> 00:26:34.223
Yeah, you know the first photo here is just three months old.

00:26:34.403 --> 00:26:37.366
And the others are not that long ago.

00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:38.007
Right!

00:26:38.748 --> 00:26:41.531
I guess you're a full-grown puppy too, ohai.

00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:46.076
Just like us.

00:26:46.877 --> 00:26:48.959
How do you think BAU BAU is?

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.061
I think it's a cute BAU BAU.

00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:53.002
BAU BAU!

00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:54.143
BAU BAU!

00:26:54.743 --> 00:26:55.524
BAU BAU!

00:26:55.604 --> 00:26:56.405
BAU BAU!

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:57.906
Just like that.

00:26:57.966 --> 00:26:58.867
BAU BAU!

00:26:59.147 --> 00:26:59.887
BAU BAU BAU BAU.

00:27:00.448 --> 00:27:01.749
Yeah, that's one.

00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:03.710
Maybe Bun wants something.

00:27:04.431 --> 00:27:05.252
I know that.

00:27:05.832 --> 00:27:07.534
Is Ruffian just about to eat?

00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:08.774
BAU BAU?

00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.056
No, Bun, no.

00:27:10.456 --> 00:27:11.537
BAU BAU?

00:27:12.903 --> 00:27:19.629
Well, Bud just turned 8 and technically he's no longer a small puppy.

00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:20.469
Who says?

00:27:22.631 --> 00:27:25.393
Ruffians, do you think Bud's no longer a small puppy?

00:27:25.413 --> 00:27:33.920
Poor grown puppy.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.081
Yes, he is.

00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:45.952
Well, that's okay because deep down, he's just as silly and playful as he was back then.

00:27:46.032 --> 00:27:47.173
I can see it in your eyes.

00:27:47.293 --> 00:27:48.653
He wants to play.

00:27:48.813 --> 00:27:49.753
I want to play.

00:27:49.913 --> 00:27:50.533
Play!

00:27:52.614 --> 00:27:55.614
You know, all of us full-grown puppies, we want to play.

00:27:55.654 --> 00:27:55.814
Yeah!

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:58.435
And happy birthday, bud!

00:27:58.555 --> 00:28:02.255
Happy birthday!

00:28:02.595 --> 00:28:02.895
BAU BAU!

00:28:02.935 --> 00:28:03.395
BAU BAU!

00:28:03.856 --> 00:28:04.196
Yeah.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.336
Not a small puppy, but still a baby.

00:28:09.202 --> 00:28:12.543
BAU BAU!

00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:16.124
And today, I went on a walk.

00:28:16.344 --> 00:28:17.404
Is that the corner's title?

00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:18.905
Is that the title?

00:28:18.925 --> 00:28:21.165
I don't think so.

00:28:21.205 --> 00:28:27.307
We didn't go for a walk today!

00:28:28.967 --> 00:28:29.287
Dance!

00:28:29.347 --> 00:28:29.727
Dance!

00:28:31.208 --> 00:28:33.748
It's a beautiful beach sunrise!

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:46.253
Oh, it does look like a boss fight's about to start there, but we're really glad that you're able to go out and go for a nice reflective walk.

00:28:46.533 --> 00:28:50.954
You know, it's kind of a little bit of a rough period, you know?

00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:52.314
It's okay.

00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:56.395
It's always hard, you know, when you come across a big decision in your life.

00:28:56.856 --> 00:28:58.056
But, don't worry.

00:28:58.564 --> 00:28:59.084
Don't worry, okay?

00:28:59.144 --> 00:28:59.965
It'll be fine.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:11.750
Yeah, you know... I think, you know, even if you decide what you're going to do and what path you're going to go down... Actually, things don't always go as you planned.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.610
Yeah.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.651
But it all works out in the end.

00:29:15.111 --> 00:29:21.154
So don't really stress out much about it and just enjoy the journey with all its ups and downs.

00:29:21.534 --> 00:29:22.915
That was positive, right?

00:29:23.475 --> 00:29:24.135
It's positive.

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:24.956
It all works out.

00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:27.657
But it's probably not gonna go how you imagined.

00:29:31.122 --> 00:29:32.784
Hopefully that makes you feel better.

00:29:33.265 --> 00:29:35.227
I hope.

00:29:35.247 --> 00:29:38.771
BAU BAU!

00:29:39.251 --> 00:29:41.914
Yeah, it'll all be good eventually.

00:29:42.474 --> 00:29:43.696
I don't know about eventually.

00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:45.542
It all works out!

00:29:46.082 --> 00:29:47.023
It'll be good!

00:29:47.323 --> 00:29:48.063
BAU BAU!

00:29:48.863 --> 00:29:57.105
And today for a Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:29:57.685 --> 00:30:01.866
Did y'all store your bunk beds in a unit or at the puppy parent's house?

00:30:02.286 --> 00:30:03.646
Or did y'all sell it?

00:30:03.666 --> 00:30:07.867
I think we would be very sad if it was gone forever!

00:30:08.207 --> 00:30:08.927
Ruffians!

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:11.588
What would you do if we told you we sold it?

00:30:15.762 --> 00:30:20.506
Somebody out there might have bought FUWAMOCO's used bunk bed.

00:30:29.843 --> 00:30:32.745
Yo, search for it!

00:30:33.205 --> 00:30:38.008
Well, Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy have our bunk beds.

00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:38.909
Yeah.

00:30:39.609 --> 00:30:41.130
This is FUWAMOCO!

00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:43.832
Actually, they have all our stuff.

00:30:43.852 --> 00:30:44.833
All our stuff.

00:30:44.873 --> 00:30:46.654
Yeah, but it's not that much.

00:30:46.974 --> 00:30:47.374
No.

00:30:47.715 --> 00:30:48.455
Yeah, right.

00:30:48.615 --> 00:30:52.718
You know, but it's very hard to get bunk beds for full-blown puppies.

00:30:53.158 --> 00:30:56.440
So, we won't let them go that easily.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:56.801
No.

00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:57.181
Yeah.

00:30:58.248 --> 00:31:05.033
But if you're wondering, as for sending you to Japan, that's definitely not happening.

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:05.493
No.

00:31:05.894 --> 00:31:06.074
No.

00:31:06.674 --> 00:31:09.656
When it's built, it stays there.

00:31:09.936 --> 00:31:11.037
It stays.

00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:12.218
Yeah.

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:13.839
BAU BAU!

00:31:13.879 --> 00:31:14.179
BAU BAU!

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.621
You can't sell it.

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:19.463
You sold it to a parrot, no?

00:31:19.563 --> 00:31:19.923
No.

00:31:19.943 --> 00:31:23.886
We ask, can you please keep this?

00:31:25.177 --> 00:31:25.817
BAU BAU!

00:31:25.857 --> 00:31:38.662
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning, and for your submissions!

00:31:38.742 --> 00:31:40.023
Maybe you have a doggy!

00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:42.704
It hasn't been the day yet.

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:47.688
You could use the hashtag... Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:31:48.168 --> 00:31:49.650
I'm sure you're talking with us.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.413
Or maybe you go on a really good walk, or you have some kind of question.

00:31:53.753 --> 00:31:57.175
Or even better, maybe you have... A FUWAMOCO scoop.

00:31:57.416 --> 00:31:59.717
You could use the hashtag FWMC... Scoop?

00:32:01.439 --> 00:32:01.819
What?

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:06.543
Maybe you didn't mean to go on a walk, but then you ended up going on a walk.

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:13.305
Thank you, Ruffians, for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning with us!

00:32:13.405 --> 00:32:15.387
BAU BAU!

00:32:16.148 --> 00:32:19.031
As for our next theme, we have...

00:32:20.703 --> 00:32:21.924
Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:32:22.024 --> 00:32:25.087
BAU BAU BAU!

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:27.610
We beat Donkey Kong Country 1!

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.751
We did.

00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:29.632
Somehow.

00:32:29.672 --> 00:32:30.152
Somehow.

00:32:30.192 --> 00:32:31.133
Took us a while.

00:32:31.173 --> 00:32:35.277
Took us a lot of screams, a lot of laughter, and a lot of fun.

00:32:35.317 --> 00:32:36.198
Broken chair.

00:32:36.478 --> 00:32:38.480
Yup, a broken chair.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.062
We're going on to Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:44.265
So we hope you join us, Ruffians!

00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:45.547
There's gonna be a lot of

00:32:46.067 --> 00:32:47.769

00:33:05.071 --> 00:33:11.193
Tomorrow, on Tuesday, we're gonna be doing our regular Advent collab.

00:33:11.473 --> 00:33:14.795
This time, tomorrow, oh yes, tomorrow.

00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:15.955
I'm so confused.

00:33:16.275 --> 00:33:19.617
We're playing FUWAMOCO Morning for the first time.

00:33:19.717 --> 00:33:22.838
I think Biboo's already beaten us.

00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:24.639
She's already played it.

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:25.499
That's okay.

00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:27.034
You permitted it.

00:33:27.554 --> 00:33:28.735
You permitted it.

00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:30.055
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:33:30.576 --> 00:33:34.057
So we're gonna be doing our best to go viral!

00:33:34.277 --> 00:33:35.397
Viral with them!

00:33:36.198 --> 00:33:36.578
Yeah?

00:33:36.898 --> 00:33:37.218
Yeah.

00:33:37.418 --> 00:33:38.999
I'm an all-star now!

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.459
Viral, viral, let's go viral!

00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:41.740
Viral, viral, let's go!

00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:46.177
Hajimaru Sighting!

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:49.021
It's another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:50.323
It's an evening!

00:33:50.683 --> 00:33:58.053
We're gonna be playing Ollie-senpai's brand new visual novel, Days with Ollie, with Ollie-senpai!

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:01.486
We're looking forward to it.

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:04.007
It's going to be our first collab with all these FUWAMOCO.

00:34:05.588 --> 00:34:07.288
BAU BAU!

00:34:07.308 --> 00:34:08.589
And then Saturday!

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:11.731
It's a FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:18.134
It feels like such a long time since we've been able to really just let loose.

00:34:18.194 --> 00:34:19.034
BAU BAU!

00:34:19.094 --> 00:34:24.837
So we're really looking forward to seeing you lots with your Ruffians!

00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:28.799
And then on Sunday for our Doggy Pack.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.624
We have a battle plan that needs to be planned.

00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:42.979
So we hope that you'll join us as we kind of think about a bunch of different things, brainstorm, and figure out the best battle plan possible.

00:34:44.443 --> 00:34:46.424
BAU BAU!

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.744

Thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:55.926 --> 00:34:57.007

00:34:57.607 --> 00:35:04.709
