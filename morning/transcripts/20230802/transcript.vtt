00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:40.318
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.262
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:44.365
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.451
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:58.232
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.033
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:03.454
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:07.235
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:10.717
Thank you for joining us on our first episode.

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:14.458
On the first official episode, right?

00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:15.958
Thank you for the BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:25.754
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:26.995
AKA FUWAMOCO.

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.295
And hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:35.937

Please make sure to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.100
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.840
Right above us.

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.443
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:49.964
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:53.067
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:59.051
Well, maybe we'll jump right into things.

00:06:00.052 --> 00:06:00.472
What's this?

00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:01.213
What's this?

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:01.893
What's this?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:08.818
We just reached 700,000 views on our cover of Kaibutsu!

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:09.439
Thank you!

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:10.159
BAU BAU!

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.233
I'm really really happy that you have been enjoying it so much.

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:19.916
Do you have any favorite parts?

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:23.859
Moco-chan, do you have a favorite part?

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.380
I like the beginning too.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.201
The beginning?

00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:32.686
There's a part in the very very beginning, Moco-chan, that you sing, that your voice gets all like... I like that part.

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:33.407
What part is that?

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:34.328
Subarashiki Sekai.

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:40.501
I'm not too sure.

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:43.082
You have to listen closely, Ruffians.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.323
It'll be in the first couple seconds.

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:49.504
We've seen in the comments that a lot of listeners seem to hear Marine-senpai.

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:57.067
Marine-senpai... Last time I checked, she's... She's not part of FUWAMOCO.

00:06:57.287 --> 00:06:59.747
Unfortunately, she's not.

00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:07.350
But it makes us happy that you would compliment us that way because we very much love Marine-senpai and Marine-senpai's voice.

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:10.124
Big compliment.

00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:11.265
She wants to apply!

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:13.387
What would her name be?

00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:18.092
I don't know if Rui-senpai would be okay with that.

00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:31.033
But would you like to hear more songs?

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:32.474
More cover songs from us?

00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:34.354
What would you like to hear?

00:07:34.374 --> 00:07:37.995
There's a lot of really good songs so it's hard to decide.

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:43.076
Actually, it did take us quite a while to decide which song we wanted to pick for our very first cover.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:43.977
It's difficult, you know?

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.097
There's so many good songs.

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:46.317
Right, you know?

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:50.298
And they can show all different types of you, so, you know?

00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.439
There's those kind of ways to enjoy it too.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.200
300 of them.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.022
Aero by YOASOBI-san.

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:02.423
Are we gonna be stuck just to YOASOBI-san?

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.245
That's not too bad though, Aero.

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:06.485
Ah, Tuning Love.

00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:08.646
Tuning Love's cute too.

00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:11.529
Lots of good suggestions.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.134
Kagamine Twins.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:18.960
We definitely didn't have that thought too.

00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.483
But thank you so much for listening to it.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:24.467
We hope that you continue to enjoy it more and more and more.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.410
We can hit 1 million?

00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.492
That would be a big team.

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:32.373
Big, big, big team.

00:08:32.393 --> 00:08:34.394
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:34.915
No, no, not yet.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.737
Maybe we can in the future.

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.198
Thank you!

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:46.122
But next, there's been another misunderstanding.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.421
Misunderstanding.

00:08:55.483 --> 00:09:02.207
I wanted to say, so last FUWAMOCO Morning, everyone was discussing tomorrow.

00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:03.588
And you know it.

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:05.469
I got confused.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.612
Yeah, because there's a lot of things I don't understand.

00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:12.714
But I feel like tomorrow isn't one of them.

00:09:13.434 --> 00:09:17.776
I just thought that, you know, there's two popular movies right now.

00:09:18.337 --> 00:09:22.799
So then I thought maybe it was something from that because there's like a lot of things I don't know.

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:26.842
And the senpai members have been sending us a lot of things I don't know.

00:09:27.342 --> 00:09:32.845
So I thought, but maybe it's from the movies or maybe it was from Die Hard.

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:35.286
Since I've never seen that movie and people like it.

00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:37.468
It seems sort of like something that would be in Die Hard.

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:46.435
But no, Moco-chan, you're just like, I don't know lots of things, so it's probably not that, right?

00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:47.035
Right.

00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:53.640
Obviously, we really like hololive, but it's very hard to know everything about hololive.

00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.843
But yeah, this was one of them.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:02.908
Actually, actually, we took the official hololive quiz, the hololive kente.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:06.110
I'm not sure if you did it.

00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:08.776
Unfortunately, you can't take it anymore.

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.399
The testing period is over.

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:13.285
But we wanted to share our scores with you, you know?

00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:24.576
hololive ID Kenten, hololive English Kenten, hololive GP Kenten, even the GP one in Japanese too.

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:26.678
We passed!

00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:29.160
The official test.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.722
Official test, you know.

00:10:31.302 --> 00:10:35.747
We were really nervous about it because they're really hard.

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:36.708
Really, really hard.

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:40.392
You know, we study up a lot.

00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:44.777
Maybe we studied a bit too much.

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.581
But we figured, you know, this would be the least we could do.

00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:52.526
And obviously, by no means does it mean that we know everything.

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:53.587
We don't know everything.

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.249
We don't know nothing.

00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:05.978
We'd like to know more too, but we're also very forgetful puppies when we're under pressure.

00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:11.199
So like, if you were to ask me, Fuwawa, what are you streaming next?

00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:12.840
I'd be like, I don't know!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.880
Right, right.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.721
So we have to make notes sometimes.

00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:21.322
Alright, so more puppies, thank you!

00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:23.862
We're pleased, Moco-chan, we're pleased.

00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:27.403
It was very fun though, but...

00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:32.760
It reminded me of being back at Guard Dog Training, right?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.140
Right.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.861
It was tricky.

00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:35.541
It was tricky.

00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:36.401
Tricky, tricky.

00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:40.423
Definitely recommend if they do hololive Kensei the official quiz again.

00:11:40.743 --> 00:11:41.083
Right!

00:11:41.123 --> 00:11:42.484
You get your certification.

00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:43.324
Certification.

00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:45.345
Yeah.

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:50.647
But also, there's been another misunderstanding.

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.748
This time it wasn't Mococo.

00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:56.310
It was me.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:08.716
During our question and answer stream, I picked up a comment about Takenoko vs Kinoko, which is Takenoko's bamboo shoots and Kinoko's mushrooms.

00:12:09.977 --> 00:12:16.941
I thought, you know, the yummiest ones are actual mushrooms and actual bamboo shoots.

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:20.174
Mushrooms are very very yummy.

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:20.754
But what about Nameko?

00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:47.948
Nameko!

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:51.510
Maybe it's still a bit tricky.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.213
I like it, but it's a bit difficult to eat a lot of them.

00:12:55.273 --> 00:13:00.657
But to set the score right, when it comes to the chocolate snack, we like... Neither.

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.741
Yeah, you know it's chocolate.

00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:10.362
The actual veggie is yummy.

00:13:10.862 --> 00:13:12.922
I prefer to have the actual vegetables.

00:13:13.262 --> 00:13:13.883
No chocolate.

00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:14.583
No snacks.

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.224
Got it!

00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:19.184
Understood.

00:13:19.624 --> 00:13:24.066
That is the end of the BAKENOKO vs KINOKO debate.

00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:25.326
The misunderstanding.

00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:28.047
It's all cleared.

00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:31.408
We can start our day knowing that it's all good now.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:40.645
Well, today we wanted to introduce our first thoughts about Advent.

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:42.466
What was it like meeting Advent?

00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:46.730
Moco-chan prepared something very special.

00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:48.791
I hope you like it.

00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:50.813
I did my best, okay?

00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:54.776
First up, we have Shiori!

00:13:57.728 --> 00:14:00.610
Our first thoughts of Shiori.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.911
The first thing she said, I remember it very clearly.

00:14:02.931 --> 00:14:04.212
She went, Shiori!

00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:06.933
It was really cute.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:10.675
So cute that I kind of thought like, is she joking?

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.917
It was that big of a gap!

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:15.658
It's very good.

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:16.138
Oh, right?

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:27.343
And then she was like really, really stoic and kind of like a bit of a hard to read ear to her, so it was a very interesting first impression, I think.

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:28.924
Very, very kakkoike.

00:14:29.504 --> 00:14:30.304
Yeah.

00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:38.868
I think to be completely honest, we were a bit scared of her at first, you know, especially with her really strong piercing bird-like eyes.

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:41.650
But I feel like, you know,

00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:46.113
It was a bit of a funny feeling at first, you know?

00:14:46.373 --> 00:14:54.539
We felt a bit troubled actually because we wanted to get to know Shiori better, but we just felt like we couldn't.

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:58.361
Like, really like, we're like, uh, FUWAMOCO what are we doing wrong, you know?

00:14:59.722 --> 00:15:05.303
We would kind of think of strategies, you know, things to get her to maybe warm up to us.

00:15:05.543 --> 00:15:07.004
Or us to warm up to her.

00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:07.384
Right?

00:15:08.464 --> 00:15:13.745
You know, she was a really tough book to crack, but all of a sudden, that just changed.

00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:16.366
And we don't feel that way anymore, you know?

00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.806
Shiori's really, really sweet.

00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:22.587
I think she definitely tries to put on a strong face, like, I'm so cool.

00:15:22.927 --> 00:15:24.607
But she's actually really, really sweet.

00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:27.648
And even I feel like a bit shy sometimes, too.

00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:30.148
She's really dependable.

00:15:30.168 --> 00:15:30.909
Dependable!

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:34.829
And she has so, so, so much knowledge in that.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:36.730
We wish we could Google search her brain.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.370
Right?

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.070
She has a lot going on in her noggin.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.291
So, it'd be nice to search it, but... You can't do that.

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:50.192
Yeah, we don't really want to overburden her with all our FUWAMOCO questions and requests and stuff like that.

00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:50.673
Yeah.

00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:58.094
Ah, and that's the other thing, you know, if the other Abyss members, if they let us be needy, right, we're gonna be needy.

00:15:59.035 --> 00:15:59.635
It's not good.

00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:01.296
They need to not spoil us.

00:16:01.817 --> 00:16:03.678
We love Shiori!

00:16:03.778 --> 00:16:07.501
We love you Shiori!

00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:09.783
We hope you make Moco-chan jealous.

00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:10.744
I did my best.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.905
I really captured your eyes.

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:14.586
I think so, I think so.

00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:16.108
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:16:16.148 --> 00:16:18.730
Does it look just like her?

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.151
It does, right?

00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:21.472
Adorable?

00:16:23.562 --> 00:16:27.644
Thank you!

00:16:27.704 --> 00:16:31.325
Next album member is Biboo!

00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:36.706
I think one of the first things she said was, I'm really shy.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:39.787
But that lasted really for about 30 minutes.

00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:43.989
I don't think she's that shy.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:46.569
Maybe she's shy like us.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:47.770
Maybe.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.311
Do you think we're shy?

00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:50.171
I think we're shy.

00:16:50.431 --> 00:16:50.732
Yeah.

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:52.433
Maybe we're the same kind of shy.

00:16:52.733 --> 00:16:56.336
But she's very cute and a very sharp rock, you know?

00:16:57.176 --> 00:16:59.258
I think she kind of downplays her powers.

00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:00.119
Yeah.

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:02.000
You know, that makes her a bit cuter too.

00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:04.342
But we can see through that.

00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:07.384
And I think she's really a master of her craft.

00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:07.784
Yeah.

00:17:07.844 --> 00:17:09.826
I mean, she's had years and years and years

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:10.346
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:11.527
She's definitely the gamer.

00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:46.658
I think there was one time where there was a reference that she wasn't a gamer and Biboo got kinda grumpy.

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:50.361
She's super sweet and super cute and you know, she just...

00:17:55.385 --> 00:18:00.768
We get this really, really strong feeling that we really need to protect her extra hard.

00:18:01.069 --> 00:18:03.410
Even though she's always smiling, she's strong.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.171
She's probably fine.

00:18:05.231 --> 00:18:10.154
We worry about her, so we want to make sure she's smiling too.

00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:12.576
We feel very protectable.

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:15.498
We're protecting her smile too, sorry.

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:21.461
I was thinking though, you know... Biboo has her little flaps, right?

00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.963
They look kind of like ears, but... And like, Biboo can fly too, right?

00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:32.146
So I was thinking that... I don't know if Biboo can do this, but... It'd be nice to kind of fly together with Biboo's flaps.

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:37.869
And then like, our twin tails could go like... Yeah.

00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:40.090
We can fly as a group together.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.051
I guess with Nerissa too.

00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:44.612
Shiori can just ride on the back.

00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:45.032
Oh really?

00:18:45.052 --> 00:18:46.313
I was gonna say we'll make her walk.

00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:55.673
And then Biboo's song cover, it actually makes us really, really emotional.

00:18:56.795 --> 00:18:58.038
I was listening to it for...

00:18:59.622 --> 00:18:59.922
That's Biboo.

00:18:59.942 --> 00:19:00.082
Biboo.

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:23.502
Next is... Fuwawa doesn't mince words.

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:24.583
What did she say wrong?

00:19:24.683 --> 00:19:25.824
What, what, what, what, what?

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:27.586
Did I say something wrong again?

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:32.311
Are we gonna have to have another misunderstanding corner for the next FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.333
It's just gonna be a regular corner.

00:19:34.353 --> 00:19:36.095
It's gonna be a regular, right?

00:19:36.715 --> 00:19:37.496
Oh well.

00:19:38.858 --> 00:19:41.020
And last but not least...

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:43.565
Nurrisa!

00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:47.128
Nurrisa, you know, she's out of heaven.

00:19:47.148 --> 00:19:56.618
She's definitely the lady that's not afraid to share what she's passionate about.

00:19:57.158 --> 00:19:59.581
I did a good job capturing your likeness, right?

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.343
She has lady lips, right?

00:20:02.188 --> 00:20:04.609
Yeah.

00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:05.830
Now I'm kinda shy.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.272
But you know, Nerissa, she also has a bit of a baby-ness to her.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:11.393
Yeah, she's a lady baby.

00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:12.553
Lady baby.

00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:16.555
But of course, she has an amazing singing voice.

00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:18.416
You know, sometimes she'll... Sometimes?

00:20:18.556 --> 00:20:19.056
All the time!

00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:23.578
She says, like, I'm not very good, you know, because of my horn issue.

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:24.299
Her horn's horny.

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:25.499
It makes sense, I guess.

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:30.422
Yeah, you know, and she causes damage to your mind when she starts singing and stuff, but...

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:35.990
Imagine if she didn't have her horn broken, then we'd all be done for.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.476
She has her horn damaged and yet we're all still smitten.

00:20:40.777 --> 00:20:42.299
Addicted.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.482
I don't know about you, Ruffians, but...

00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.793
Have you been able to get Love Me Love Me out of your head?

00:20:48.273 --> 00:20:54.556
Because I know that... I woke up and it was just the... Give me your love!

00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:57.098
That's all that's in my head!

00:20:57.118 --> 00:20:58.058
So, it's no good.

00:20:58.098 --> 00:21:00.340
Lifetime Showtime is competing.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.981
It's competing.

00:21:02.181 --> 00:21:03.221
Oh, they're rivals.

00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:08.083
Yeah, it must be Nerissa's demonic powers, right?

00:21:09.624 --> 00:21:18.428
The other thing that comes to mind, I think, the first impression, Nerissa really likes to be physical with us and the other element members.

00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:24.771
I remember when we first saw her, it kind of looked like she had made Biboo her toy.

00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:27.249
Tiny toy.

00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:30.230
They were like stuck together.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.813
Probably against Biboo's will, but Biboo was just smiling.

00:21:35.913 --> 00:21:39.635
And then, there was one time, suddenly I think...

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.143
Just suddenly, out of nowhere, Nerissa just Kabedon'd me!

00:21:47.024 --> 00:21:47.845
Very casually.

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:55.070
My first Kabedon, I tried really hard to have a straight face, but inside I was panicking.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.091
It was too casual.

00:21:56.391 --> 00:21:59.093
It was too casual, just all of a sudden she's just like, heh heh.

00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:02.496
Yeah, I was surprised.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.638
Have you ever been Kabedon'd, Ruffians?

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:10.066
Maybe...maybe we'll have the opportunity to introduce you.

00:22:10.146 --> 00:22:10.866
I'm sorry.

00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:12.007
Are you sure?

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:16.509
I was trying to be strong, but inside I was like... You liked it though, didn't you?

00:22:17.229 --> 00:22:17.769
No, no, no.

00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:18.430
Nerissa!

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.270
Nerissa!

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.210
Me!

00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:20.811
Me!

00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:21.811
No, no, no.

00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:22.431
Nerissa.

00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:26.939
I wonder what was going through Nerissa's head.

00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:28.140
What was her motive?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.101
Maybe she wanted to just make you flustered.

00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:30.882
Maybe.

00:22:31.182 --> 00:22:33.424
And then I did the perfect thing.

00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:34.866
I just had a straight face.

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:35.866
No reaction.

00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:39.970
She did enjoy it, fine.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.470
I'm safe.

00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.073
The other thing about Nerissa.

00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:45.495
Her legs are very pretty.

00:22:45.835 --> 00:22:47.336
Especially when she crosses them.

00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:49.876
It was hard not to stare.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:53.617
But I made sure you know, I made sure to compliment.

00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:58.820
Because I thought, maybe that might make Nerissa happy.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.681
She seems the type.

00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:00.841
What?

00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:01.521
The type?

00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:02.942
What does that mean?

00:23:03.162 --> 00:23:05.063
The type to like those kind of compliments.

00:23:05.203 --> 00:23:06.283
It's a nice compliment.

00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:09.965
If it's a nice compliment, you say the compliment.

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:10.245
Right.

00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:14.187
But yeah, she always is really helpful.

00:23:14.207 --> 00:23:16.688
And you know, thinking about all the other avid members.

00:23:17.068 --> 00:23:21.013
I was really kind and it's like a big bird that you can count on always.

00:23:21.473 --> 00:23:22.134
A big bird.

00:23:22.274 --> 00:23:23.696
A big bird you can count on.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:26.118
It's important to have a big bird you can count on.

00:23:26.158 --> 00:23:26.959
I'm not nervous.

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:33.787
Thank you!

00:23:33.807 --> 00:23:39.372
I wonder, Ruffians, if your first impressions of the other Abbot members are similar to us.

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:44.036
Let us know with the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

00:23:44.336 --> 00:23:47.619
Now for today's new corner!

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:50.641
It's Doggie of the Day!

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:53.084
Today we have... De-den!

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.114
We have this cutie!

00:23:56.154 --> 00:23:57.754
He's the Doggie of the Day!

00:23:57.814 --> 00:23:59.695
BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:01.576
You know, he's very strong.

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:04.257
Guard dog goals, I would say.

00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.678
Look at his nose, it looks so good.

00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:11.239
It looks like the PlayStation controller.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.780
The PlayStation 2 controller!

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.861
I wanna touch it.

00:24:16.181 --> 00:24:17.422
What is his name though?

00:24:17.502 --> 00:24:19.223
Should we give him a name?

00:24:19.243 --> 00:24:20.283
Let's give him a name then.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.948
He looks like a fluffy to me.

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.090
But he looks fuzzy though, like his nose.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.551
Give me a fuzzy.

00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:28.371
A fuzzy?

00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:29.092
Fuzzies.

00:24:29.152 --> 00:24:29.612
A fuzzy.

00:24:30.012 --> 00:24:30.913
That's his name now.

00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:32.394
Should his name be fluffy or fuzzy?

00:24:33.214 --> 00:24:34.755
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:24:35.195 --> 00:24:37.136
Is he more fluffy or more fuzzy?

00:24:37.577 --> 00:24:38.377
Fluffy or fuzzy.

00:24:38.437 --> 00:24:39.638
What a dog, right?

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:40.098
Right!

00:24:40.138 --> 00:24:41.239
Dog goes!

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:42.620
Very beautiful.

00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:44.381
Fluffy.

00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:45.321
Fuzzy.

00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:47.022
Fluffy PlayStation.

00:24:47.042 --> 00:24:49.584
This is a dog, not a PlayStation.

00:24:51.937 --> 00:24:53.197
Wow, buzzy.

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:54.858
We'll call it buzzy for now.

00:24:55.038 --> 00:24:56.678
But I wonder what his bark sounds like.

00:24:56.698 --> 00:24:59.078
You know, he looks very royal.

00:24:59.218 --> 00:24:59.598
Yeah.

00:24:59.618 --> 00:25:00.979
So, you think it'd be more like a roar?

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:01.839
BAU!

00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:02.719
BAU!

00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:03.579
BAU!

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:04.339
Like a bower?

00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:05.019
BAU.

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:05.599
A bower.

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:06.059
Yeah.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.420
I kind of feel like it'd be maybe a bit more like... BAU!

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.260
BAU!

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.481
Like a kind of like a husky softness?

00:25:13.981 --> 00:25:14.241
BAU!

00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:16.901
Oh, like a deep, a deep bork sound?

00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:17.441
Deep bork?

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:18.202
Maybe.

00:25:18.562 --> 00:25:18.962
Maybe.

00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:19.902
Yeah.

00:25:21.323 --> 00:25:29.148
Do we give this fuzzy royal guard dog, do we give them a rating?

00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:37.053
I think his rating is he's a very good boy who loves you a lot.

00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:39.394
We have competition, Moco-chan!

00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:42.721
Gotta do our best.

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.502
Do our best!

00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:46.203
Thank you for the Doggie of the Day!

00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:50.724
Remember, we're always taking more doggies of the day, so please send us some!

00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:51.345
Thank you!

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:52.385
Thank you!

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:56.406
And our next beginning of another new segment.

00:25:57.367 --> 00:26:00.268
Today, I went for a walk.

00:26:00.488 --> 00:26:01.408
I went on a walk.

00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:03.129
On a walk.

00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:04.810
On a walk.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.290
I went on a walk.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.511
Well, let's see what was this walk like.

00:26:09.397 --> 00:26:11.378
Here's today's submission!

00:26:11.898 --> 00:26:14.400
This looks like a very beautiful walk.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:21.303
You know, all the clouds look so fluffy, but the blue skies, the grass is green, the trees are lush.

00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:23.184
Very peaceful for your heart.

00:26:23.525 --> 00:26:28.247
I hope it wasn't too hot, but you know, I think the cold tea probably helped a lot too, right?

00:26:28.527 --> 00:26:31.749
You know, sometimes when we go on walks, we get really, really thirsty.

00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:35.131
So sometimes as sort of treat, we'll get one to share.

00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:35.751
Right!

00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:37.092
You know, tea is a treat.

00:26:38.232 --> 00:26:39.593
But it really is a treat.

00:26:39.693 --> 00:26:40.294
It's a treat.

00:26:40.514 --> 00:26:41.454
It's tea!

00:26:43.856 --> 00:26:48.478
But it's good to stay hydrated, so make sure you always drink lots and lots of water.

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:50.319
And sunscreen too!

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.580
Be like with Koicha as well.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.081
Yeah, Koicha's good!

00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:57.103
But yeah, sunscreen, and watch out for cars, okay?

00:26:57.163 --> 00:26:58.524
Cars, yeah.

00:26:58.564 --> 00:26:59.504
Safety always.

00:26:59.524 --> 00:27:04.927
Make sure you're always making sure that you're safe in your environment, okay?

00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:05.407
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:06.628 --> 00:27:08.029
Thank you!

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.673
And next, a sudden addition of a news segment.

00:27:12.893 --> 00:27:16.396
We have Question of the Day!

00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:17.116
De-den!

00:27:18.117 --> 00:27:18.738
Quite a good question.

00:27:18.778 --> 00:27:23.041
Is there anything you would like to try when you visit Japan?

00:27:31.465 --> 00:27:32.005
Wanko Soba.

00:27:32.045 --> 00:27:33.006
Soba is buckwheat noodle.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:28:00.537
Wanko Soba is like a dish from Iwate Prefecture, but it's really just small servings of soba noodles in your bowl, and so you eat that, and then there's a soba keeper that will give you a new bowl, and then you repeat.

00:28:00.738 --> 00:28:02.098
It's kind of like a bit of a race.

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:03.939
Yeah, they're smiling, right?

00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:12.744
Yeah, and Wanko Soba is kind of like a feeling, you know, it's like you're a dog and you're really hungry, you know, so you gotta eat fast, fast, fast, fast, fast!

00:28:12.844 --> 00:28:13.044
Eat!

00:28:13.084 --> 00:28:14.085
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:17.480
We've never tried Ranko Soba before.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.724
I guess we don't really like being watched while eating because we get nervous.

00:28:22.924 --> 00:28:24.725
But we'll do our best to eat lots.

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:26.686
Like good puppies, okay?

00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:30.728
And then afterwards, you know, you can count how many bowls that you eat.

00:28:30.748 --> 00:28:32.569
Yeah, you can do it with your friends too, right?

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.571
How many bowls do you think he's eaten though?

00:28:36.032 --> 00:28:37.893
Oh, uncountable.

00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:41.275
But Ruffians, have you had Soba before?

00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:41.655
Yeah!

00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:43.556
Do you like Udon or Soba?

00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:44.717
Yeah, Udon or Soba.

00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:52.456
We're talking about wanko soba, so I feel bad if I don't say that I like soba the best, but... You can eat 70?

00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:52.816
Soba.

00:28:52.837 --> 00:28:53.477
Udon.

00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:58.422
Moco-chan, let's both say it at the same time, okay?

00:28:58.442 --> 00:28:58.582
Udon!

00:28:58.602 --> 00:29:00.404
It's different.

00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:13.687
But I only like, I like udon when it's really nice and chewy.

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:14.868
I like that udon too.

00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:15.108
Right?

00:29:15.148 --> 00:29:20.271
Sometimes there's like a thin udon and then I'm like... It's not what I was thinking.

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.571
But it's good too!

00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:23.072
Soba's good too though.

00:29:23.652 --> 00:29:25.133
Soba's one of my favorite in Japan.

00:29:25.153 --> 00:29:29.916
There's some really really good soba places too.

00:29:30.616 --> 00:29:33.037
I like to be able to have like fresh udon too, you know?

00:29:33.077 --> 00:29:33.638
Yeah!

00:29:34.558 --> 00:29:35.820
There's lots of yummy things.

00:29:36.562 --> 00:29:38.164
But, but, but!

00:29:39.627 --> 00:29:39.907
Next!

00:29:40.448 --> 00:29:40.728
Next!

00:29:41.229 --> 00:29:47.519
Our next stream, we will be playing Boki's Jump Scare.

00:29:52.572 --> 00:29:54.493
We thought it really looked cute.

00:29:54.553 --> 00:29:56.414
It's like a cute scary, right?

00:29:56.434 --> 00:29:58.254
Yeah, we were preparing.

00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:00.715
It's a jumpscare mansion, but you know... It's cute.

00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:04.596
That's just one kind of form of horror, right?

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:10.378
So we opened it up and it already jumpscared us.

00:30:10.738 --> 00:30:13.679
We had to both look away from the screen and then...

00:30:14.239 --> 00:30:18.821
FUWAMOCO-chan was like, ahh, maybe not now, maybe I can't do this anymore.

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:24.283
I didn't want to close off the game because I thought it was going to jump scare me again.

00:30:24.303 --> 00:30:25.783
Yeah.

00:30:25.863 --> 00:30:27.284
When do the jump scares happen?

00:30:27.744 --> 00:30:28.484
When do they stop?

00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:30.985
I guess that's the point of a jump scare, right?

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:35.347
I hope it's more cute than what I've experienced so far.

00:30:35.407 --> 00:30:35.887
Yeah.

00:30:36.287 --> 00:30:39.188
So, we'll definitely need your help.

00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:40.829
We need your help.

00:30:40.889 --> 00:30:42.610
You better hold our paws, okay?

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:42.850
Yeah.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:51.273
But even though you know it's a scary game, we're really looking forward to it because we want to play a game with you so bad!

00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:52.593
We want to play a game!

00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:57.335
We've been really happy to be able to chat lots and lots, but I feel like...

00:30:58.522 --> 00:31:03.186
We should play a game sometime soon too, you know?

00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:08.590
We'll be playing that later today, so we hope you'll be there, okay?

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.290
Today!

00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:10.271
Today!

00:31:10.371 --> 00:31:14.975
Not tomorrow!

00:31:14.995 --> 00:31:15.435
Today!

00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:16.416
Today!

00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:23.842
Can you, as a punishment, can you say somewhere in your best Ina-senpai impersonation?

00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:26.773
Tomorrow!

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:29.794
Tomorrow!

00:31:30.234 --> 00:31:31.975
I give it a B+.

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:33.555
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:35.716
Rate Moco-chan's tomorrow.

00:31:35.736 --> 00:31:44.659
But remember, Spooky Jumpscare Mansion is today today.

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:45.619
10 out of 10!

00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:45.979
C-!

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:46.440
C-.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.960
It's good to be honest.

00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:53.002
And before we end today, let's have another peek at our schedule.

00:31:53.042 --> 00:31:53.582
How about it?

00:31:55.535 --> 00:31:57.455
Let's begin our schedule!

00:31:57.495 --> 00:32:00.036
Don't forget, our first Advent collab is coming up.

00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:01.776
Our first game collab.

00:32:02.376 --> 00:32:03.576
I'm really excited about it.

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:08.797
I can't wait to be able to be there with Shiori and Bijou and Risu again.

00:32:08.837 --> 00:32:11.398
I feel like it's been too long.

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:12.978
I really miss them.

00:32:13.138 --> 00:32:15.418
We're gonna do our best to protect all of Advent.

00:32:17.379 --> 00:32:19.839
It's gonna be a bit scary, but we'll do our best!

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:23.480
Actually, recently, I've been feeling a bit...

00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:26.343
I don't want to share them!

00:32:44.594 --> 00:32:45.716
It's a funny feeling.

00:32:46.017 --> 00:32:50.324
Maybe it's not the most positive feeling, but... We have to share them now.

00:32:50.785 --> 00:32:53.510
Yeah, we're not gonna keep them away from you.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.511
They're free.

00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:55.693
That's okay.

00:32:55.713 --> 00:32:56.435
We're free.

00:32:58.448 --> 00:33:04.455
And also, we have our first karaoke stream at FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:33:04.495 --> 00:33:06.377
It's coming up on Saturday.

00:33:06.577 --> 00:33:09.520
Are you excited with us?

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.521
We're very excited.

00:33:10.742 --> 00:33:12.323
I don't know if you're excited.

00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:14.606
Is there anything you want to hear us sing?

00:33:16.075 --> 00:33:17.476
I'm always curious, you know.

00:33:17.937 --> 00:33:22.581
It's our first first Welcome Party, so I want to make sure that it's good.

00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:25.864
Good set list.

00:33:26.464 --> 00:33:29.767
And finally, do you notice the question question question mic?

00:33:30.648 --> 00:33:31.068
What is it?

00:33:31.088 --> 00:33:33.871
It's a good mystery.

00:33:33.991 --> 00:33:34.792
It's a mystery.

00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:38.695
But you have to be there to find out, so make sure you're there, okay?

00:33:38.715 --> 00:33:38.915
Yeah.

00:33:39.876 --> 00:33:40.096
Well...

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:48.351
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:51.876
Ruffians, are you ready?

00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:56.088
Kiyo Kiyo!

00:33:56.528 --> 00:33:57.368
Ashita Ganbatte!

00:33:57.388 --> 00:33:59.089
BAU BAU!

00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:01.229
KSHMR!

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.311
BAU BAU!

00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:06.391
Zokko!

00:34:06.552 --> 00:34:08.112
BAU BAU!

00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:09.133
Tomshi!

00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:10.473
BAU BAU!

00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:11.193
Nino!

00:34:11.473 --> 00:34:12.974
BAU BAU!

00:34:13.334 --> 00:34:15.075
And to every other Ruffian out there,

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:17.818
I hope you have a howl of a day!

00:34:18.259 --> 00:34:21.603
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
