## ❓ Question Of The Day ([27:40](https://youtu.be/X4Anzun9bKk?t=27m40s))

[A Ruffian](https://twitter.com/yurimiyanae/status/1716191380580839841) asks FUWAMOCO if there's ever been a story that made them change their outlook on life. The twin sister shared that they were influenced by many of the Visual Novels they've read, as well as by the stories and interviews from other creators. It seems that Mama puppy and Papa puppy have also been a big influence in their way of being.
