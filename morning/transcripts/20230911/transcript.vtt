05:02.970 --> 05:05.750
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:06.264 --> 05:09.928
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:09.948 --> 05:12.972
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimari yo!

05:15.299 --> 05:19.882
Ruffians, what did you think of our new jingle?

05:19.962 --> 05:21.863
Thank you so much, Aina!

05:21.943 --> 05:23.183
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:23.203 --> 05:27.406
For introductions, I'm Nanachihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:27.766 --> 05:29.907
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:29.927 --> 05:31.628
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:31.668 --> 05:34.150
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:34.490 --> 05:38.092
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.112 --> 05:43.135
Thank you for joining us today for our 18th episode!

05:43.875 --> 05:45.255
BAU BAU BAU BAU.

05:45.775 --> 05:47.456
18 episodes.

05:48.276 --> 05:47.456
18.

05:49.036 --> 05:55.338
Well, Ruffians, you know, I saw a couple Ruffians that maybe this was their first time for FUWAMOCO Morning today.

05:55.718 --> 06:01.439
So to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it is a short format morning show.

06:01.719 --> 06:04.600
And it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.180
A.k.a.

06:05.300 --> 06:05.900
FUWAMOCO.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.441
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:09.441 --> 06:14.505
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.608
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:19.008 --> 06:20.169
FWMC Morning.

06:20.769 --> 06:25.012
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:25.032 --> 06:28.375
BAU BAU!

06:28.875 --> 06:35.160
So first, we have another Pero Sighting.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.986
Another Ruffian found Pero.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.148
This is good.

06:40.168 --> 06:42.912
This is good, but let's see.

06:44.748 --> 06:45.248
Oh!

06:45.588 --> 06:45.788
Oh!

06:46.489 --> 06:47.289
Cute!

06:47.789 --> 06:50.770
Pero was spotted in a UFO catcher!

06:52.751 --> 06:53.791
That's pretty fun.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.172
Don't bother fishing it out!

06:57.752 --> 07:00.773
You know, look, there's the cute blue monster in the front.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.034
There's so many better things than him in real life.

07:03.054 --> 07:06.495
Yeah, like the white alien with the pretty pink toes.

07:06.515 --> 07:08.236
Maybe grab those instead.

07:08.276 --> 07:09.216
The pink toes.

07:09.536 --> 07:10.537
Yeah, you know.

07:11.597 --> 07:12.998
Actually, Ruffians, here's a gift.

07:13.338 --> 07:14.159
Windows for us.

07:16.240 --> 07:16.801
Not Pero.

07:17.041 --> 07:17.561
Not Pero.

07:17.601 --> 07:18.102
The other ones.

07:18.122 --> 07:19.303
The other ones, the cute ones.

07:19.343 --> 07:21.424
You know, the ones that actually have value to them.

07:22.005 --> 07:23.646
Those ones, you know.

07:23.906 --> 07:28.509
Although, you know, we're actually pretty strong when it comes to UFO catchers, okay?

07:28.689 --> 07:33.132
Yeah, we really, really, really like UFO catchers.

07:34.073 --> 07:36.096
Have you done that before, Ruffians?

07:48.510 --> 07:48.950
We haven't.

07:49.330 --> 07:49.570
No.

07:49.811 --> 07:50.391
We've never.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.731
We'd like to try though.

07:51.811 --> 07:53.552
Right, we'd like to try it together with you.

07:53.572 --> 07:55.273
It just seems dangerous.

07:55.373 --> 08:00.335
Yeah, you know we've never done it because we always feel like we might get a bit hooked.

08:00.815 --> 08:07.158
But I think when it comes to UFO catches, we really like to win the cute plushies the most, you know?

08:08.218 --> 08:15.803
Sometimes, you know, we try to watch some videos on YouTube to learn all the tricks from special YouTubers who do that sort of stuff.

08:16.604 --> 08:19.646
But I think the kind of trick is you have to use your brain.

08:19.686 --> 08:22.067
You have to think of interesting ways to win a bet.

08:22.207 --> 08:24.729
Yeah, you have to look at all the corners and stuff, right?

08:24.769 --> 08:26.210
That's what makes it really fun.

08:27.130 --> 08:32.153
And then sometimes, when you win, you can make new cute friends.

08:33.274 --> 08:34.855
That's why they're the best, you know?

08:35.916 --> 08:39.778
I hope that we can enjoy UFO Catches all together sometime.

08:40.058 --> 08:41.619
But, yeah, Pero.

08:41.719 --> 08:42.499
Pero, right?

08:42.660 --> 08:43.720
He's important.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.921
He's in this photo, right?

08:46.562 --> 08:48.083
He can just kinda stay there, right?

08:48.123 --> 08:49.003
Yeah, he can hang out.

08:49.103 --> 08:49.664
It'll be good.

08:49.684 --> 08:51.605
Oh, he makes a good pushy.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.907
Maybe, you know, he'll find a layout soon.

08:55.507 --> 08:59.929
Maybe some poor kid comes along and fishes him out?

08:59.969 --> 09:00.950
That's too bad for them.

09:01.010 --> 09:03.131
I think any other prize would be better.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.232
Maybe no prize might be better.

09:05.252 --> 09:07.853
Ruffians!

09:08.393 --> 09:12.375
Please let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

09:12.775 --> 09:17.377
Remember to use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

09:17.537 --> 09:20.599
BAU BAU!

09:21.219 --> 09:23.220
And today we actually have some

09:24.120 --> 09:25.902
HAPPY NEWS!

09:25.922 --> 09:28.243
Yeah, happy news.

09:28.323 --> 09:37.730
You know, yesterday, after our Donkey Kong Country stream, we happened to pop into Mumei's stream to tell her she was joining us and all of Abyss!

09:38.051 --> 09:39.071
Ruffians, did you see?

09:39.091 --> 09:39.592
Did you see?

09:39.852 --> 09:44.795
We kind of redirected into Mumei's stream, but still... But we didn't expect that.

09:45.516 --> 09:45.856
Right?

09:46.257 --> 09:46.497
Right?

09:46.537 --> 09:51.480
We were really so, so, so, so happy to be able to do that, you know?

09:53.061 --> 09:55.643
Mumei-senpai's drawings are really amazing.

09:57.664 --> 10:02.026
Actually, kinda really scare us too.

10:02.046 --> 10:03.306
They scare me!

10:03.346 --> 10:08.649
Do you remember how Mumei-senpai's special scare does?

10:09.089 --> 10:11.410
A boy in holo-cure.

10:11.590 --> 10:16.472
It was really really really scary.

10:16.692 --> 10:19.574
Maybe Moco-chan, let's see how the illustrations are going.

10:21.348 --> 10:24.633
What do you think, Ruffians?

10:24.673 --> 10:25.193
Nightmares!

10:34.682 --> 10:41.069
Oh well, Mumei-senpai said you know that they have like a strong soccer dog mom feeling to them, right?

10:41.629 --> 10:53.923
I don't know what to think about that, but... Maybe, you know, one day this is what Moco-chan will look like when she has a team full of puppies and I have my own team of puppies and we could, you know, battle them out.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.384
Against each other in a game of soccer.

10:57.145 --> 10:57.505
Right.

10:57.885 --> 10:59.866
He's gonna sound like Pokemon.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.768
Really?

11:03.328 --> 11:03.749
I don't know.

11:03.769 --> 11:06.750
Maybe it's a bit more like a nightmare?

11:06.770 --> 11:08.391
Or a strange dream?

11:08.451 --> 11:09.672
A strange dream at least.

11:09.952 --> 11:10.913
What do you think, Ruffians?

11:10.953 --> 11:11.453
Which one?

11:11.473 --> 11:16.736
Is she violent?

11:16.836 --> 11:17.677
Well, you know.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.018
Might get that really good.

11:20.038 --> 11:20.158
Huh?

11:23.948 --> 11:25.269
It'd be good if this stayed a dream.

11:26.030 --> 11:28.092
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.695
Ruffians are okay with it though.

11:31.135 --> 11:33.417
I don't want to have a team of puppies.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.861
No team of puppies?

11:36.901 --> 11:38.522
No reality, not like this.

11:38.742 --> 11:41.485
How many puppies would you need to fill a soccer team?

11:43.167 --> 11:45.789
How many members are on a soccer team?

11:46.069 --> 11:46.930
Ten or more.

11:50.141 --> 11:50.722
Eleven.

11:50.962 --> 11:52.943
Why is it not an even number?

11:53.663 --> 11:55.404
I don't like that.

11:55.684 --> 11:58.025
Yeah, this doesn't need to be reality.

12:00.527 --> 12:01.227
BAU BAU!

12:01.287 --> 12:02.928
Thank you Mumei-senpai!

12:03.328 --> 12:06.230
We're looking forward to it.

12:06.270 --> 12:09.892
BAU BAU!

12:09.952 --> 12:12.553
And that was our happy news.

12:12.573 --> 12:14.734
Good to start the day with some happy news.

12:14.754 --> 12:16.315
What comes with happy news?

12:16.335 --> 12:17.456
More happy news, right?

12:18.311 --> 12:18.671
Sad news.

12:30.831 --> 12:31.531
Ruffians.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.214
So also, yesterday.

12:35.234 --> 12:38.176
The good news happened and the bad news happened both yesterday.

12:38.296 --> 12:41.418
There was a casualty!

12:41.438 --> 12:42.278
A death!

12:42.659 --> 12:45.300
I know we talked about no casualties, but there was.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.481
There was, yeah.

12:46.881 --> 12:48.402
Moco-chan's chair.

12:49.403 --> 12:52.165
It was a sacrifice to Donkey Kong.

12:53.556 --> 12:57.940
I died that one time and then I became one with the floor.

13:10.461 --> 13:14.322
I got back up, but then I broke the arm of my chair off.

13:15.883 --> 13:24.885
You know, all the screws just fell out and I tried fixing it today because it's really bugging me, but I don't have the screwdriver that works for it.

13:27.326 --> 13:28.467
The screws.

13:28.487 --> 13:31.269
That's what a screwdriver does.

13:31.329 --> 13:34.831
So they just keep on falling out after I try to screw them in with my hands.

13:36.552 --> 13:38.574
I'm doing my best but it's not working.

13:39.894 --> 13:47.479
And you know, to be honest, the other arm, the arm that I still have, it's only held in by one screw too.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.543
So, I might end up with no arms very soon.

13:54.886 --> 13:57.491
It's just a seat at that point, right?

13:57.511 --> 13:58.132
It's just a seat.

13:58.192 --> 14:01.578
Hopefully I'm still left with a seat.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.104
But hopefully I can fix it soon.

14:07.298 --> 14:11.620
You know, it's important to have a good, proper chair for your health, Ruffians.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.141
Yeah, at least have a good seat with a back.

14:15.461 --> 14:20.542
Yeah, let's focus on the half because it still has the bottom part of the seat.

14:20.582 --> 14:22.663
Yeah, and I still have my arms.

14:22.923 --> 14:28.025
My chair might not have much arms left, but I still have my arms.

14:30.239 --> 14:31.359
I didn't try to break it.

14:32.859 --> 14:33.400
He gave up.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.640
He fell apart.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.440
It's Donkey Kong's fault, right?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.300
Yeah, yeah.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.981
He was... He was... Yeah, that's it.

14:40.021 --> 14:41.601
Good luck, chair!

14:43.301 --> 14:44.161
Good luck, chair!

14:44.201 --> 14:45.662
Good luck, me!

14:46.342 --> 14:50.623
BAU BAU!

14:50.643 --> 14:56.584
Actually, the sad news doesn't just stop there.

14:57.784 --> 14:58.804
There's been

14:59.781 --> 15:03.104
Another misunderstanding.

15:04.846 --> 15:07.068
And this one is pretty big.

15:07.248 --> 15:11.592
Yeah, you know, it's a very serious misunderstanding.

15:11.652 --> 15:18.238
Something, you know, something we absolutely, at all costs, must clear up with you ruffians, okay?

15:19.159 --> 15:24.004
It's something that's been happening here on every single FUWAMOCO Morning.

15:24.264 --> 15:24.865
Something bad.

15:25.552 --> 15:26.893
Almost every episode.

15:26.953 --> 15:28.073
You didn't even notice.

15:28.153 --> 15:30.774
Yeah, we just kinda kept it hidden from you, you know?

15:31.595 --> 15:36.937
Yeah, so... Today... We're going to FINALLY clear it up!

15:37.537 --> 15:38.418
Is that okay?

15:39.418 --> 15:40.078
You didn't know.

15:41.139 --> 15:43.020
But we're gonna break it to you.

15:43.260 --> 15:44.921
Don't be too shocked, okay?

15:44.941 --> 15:48.042
FUWAMOCO Morning.

15:49.409 --> 15:54.772
It's only supposed to be 20 minutes!

15:54.792 --> 15:57.013
20 minutes, but only 20 minutes long.

15:57.033 --> 16:00.335
Most often it's more like 40 minutes, right?

16:01.856 --> 16:06.538
You know, our shortest one was 32 minutes!

16:06.578 --> 16:08.259
It's supposed to be 20!

16:08.399 --> 16:10.500
But it's kinda close to the goal, you know?

16:11.001 --> 16:11.321
Is it?

16:13.427 --> 16:18.350
But recently it's been getting longer and longer and longer and longer.

16:18.450 --> 16:21.512
You know, I think last time was 48 minutes.

16:21.652 --> 16:23.453
Yeah, that's almost 50 minutes.

16:23.493 --> 16:27.536
That's like two episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning in one, right?

16:27.636 --> 16:27.976
Right.

16:29.577 --> 16:30.858
It's only 20 minutes.

16:30.938 --> 16:31.398
Yeah.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.180
So, Ruffians, we want you to understand.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.482
FUWAMOCO Morning is supposed to be only 20 minutes long.

16:40.864 --> 16:42.385
Whether we'll actually get there though,

16:43.717 --> 16:44.557
That's the next question.

16:44.577 --> 16:45.738
That's up to us, right?

16:45.758 --> 16:47.839
It's up to FUWAMOCO!

16:49.959 --> 16:50.800
We'll do our best.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.461
But... I don't know how good we can do.

16:57.202 --> 16:59.883
Thank you Ruffians for believing in us, right?

16:59.923 --> 17:01.383
You believe in us, right?

17:01.744 --> 17:02.504
We can do it!

17:06.526 --> 17:10.609
Let's continue!

17:10.689 --> 17:11.149
Okay!

17:11.450 --> 17:13.671
Okay!

17:14.152 --> 17:17.114
Well, next we have something new.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.855
We have a challenge.

17:19.195 --> 17:27.642
Today's challenge is not just trying to get FUWAMOCO Morning to be 20 minutes, but today we're going to start our day with this.

17:27.802 --> 17:28.642
Something new.

17:29.563 --> 17:30.223
You know, because

17:31.164 --> 17:33.788
It's good to challenge ourselves to something new every day.

17:33.988 --> 17:36.793
Particularly this challenge is for Moco-chan, you know?

17:36.813 --> 17:43.122
Ruffians, you know, I told you before that I really, really like to eat.

17:44.281 --> 17:45.502
Natto in the morning.

17:45.562 --> 17:46.763
I have it every day.

17:46.783 --> 17:51.346
And if you don't know what natto is, it's fermented soybeans.

17:51.806 --> 17:55.048
And you know, it's really, really, really healthy for you.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.791
It's like a superfood among superfoods.

17:59.671 --> 18:01.432
Maybe it's a little bit slimy.

18:01.973 --> 18:05.135
Maybe it's a little bit... It has a bit of a scent to it.

18:05.996 --> 18:06.776
A scent.

18:06.996 --> 18:09.418
Yeah, maybe some people might say it's a bit... Pungency.

18:10.769 --> 18:12.010
It has a scent to it, you know?

18:12.090 --> 18:13.412
It's not the worst part.

18:13.432 --> 18:14.973
It's full of vitamin K2!

18:15.473 --> 18:17.455
And it's really good for you.

18:17.475 --> 18:20.438
You know, Moco-chan, you don't really like it, right?

18:21.019 --> 18:22.560
I like it!

18:22.840 --> 18:24.922
I want to like it, but I can't.

18:25.543 --> 18:28.666
But Ruffians, Moco-chan's tummy is really important, right?

18:30.101 --> 18:31.582
Your tummy is important too.

18:32.702 --> 18:35.843
My tummy is good because I eat natto every day.

18:36.083 --> 18:41.105
But you know, it's been hurting with all the screaming and the scary stuff.

18:41.125 --> 18:43.986
And playing a lot of intense games, right?

18:44.006 --> 18:49.348
So today, I thought that this would be the day that Moco-chan eats natto.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.669
Conquer the natto, right?

18:50.689 --> 18:52.089
I have to conquer it today.

18:52.109 --> 18:55.391
I thought it would be like a, let's try, let's get there.

18:55.491 --> 18:56.151
Today's the day.

18:56.571 --> 18:57.353
Today's the day.

18:57.493 --> 18:58.795
I'm gonna slowly, okay?

18:58.835 --> 19:00.377
I'm gonna do my best, okay?

19:00.397 --> 19:02.360
I'm not gonna... I can't do it all.

19:02.561 --> 19:05.085
So we have one pack here with us today.

19:05.525 --> 19:06.948
I gotta do the thing, I gotta do the thing.

19:12.159 --> 19:15.861
Moco-chan's gonna do her best to eat all 50 grams of it.

19:16.282 --> 19:18.163
It's from Tochigi Prefecture.

19:18.523 --> 19:19.944
Tochigi, thank you.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.165
Thank you, Tochigi.

19:21.886 --> 19:24.788
But if Moco-chan doesn't eat it all, I will!

19:25.108 --> 19:26.289
Okay, Moco-chan, here we go!

19:29.574 --> 19:31.294
Okay.

19:31.374 --> 19:31.995
Eat some more.

19:33.595 --> 19:36.416
And we're gonna eat it without any tare, no sauce.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.056
No mustard.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.216
I have a tissue.

19:38.896 --> 19:42.297
I'm prepared.

19:42.837 --> 19:46.158
It looks delicious.

19:46.178 --> 19:47.938
Okay.

19:51.079 --> 19:51.699
Moco-chan!

19:51.880 --> 19:52.940
You have to do the stuff, okay?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.841
Ruffians, should I stir it up lots for Moco-chan?

19:54.881 --> 19:55.822
No, no, I don't want it to be fluffy!

19:55.842 --> 19:56.942
You get more vitamins!

19:57.022 --> 19:58.043
No, I don't want it fluffy!

19:58.083 --> 19:58.963
It was fluffy with vitamins!

19:59.003 --> 20:01.245
Let me have it not fluffy first, okay?

20:01.265 --> 20:03.786
Okay, Moco-chan, do you need me to feed it to you?

20:04.647 --> 20:04.927
No.

20:05.307 --> 20:05.587
No?

20:05.847 --> 20:06.508
You're gonna do it?

20:06.528 --> 20:07.568
I'm gonna try.

20:07.588 --> 20:09.189
I can't say if I'm gonna do it or not.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.510
Maybe I'll make it a bit easier.

20:10.530 --> 20:11.991
I'll take this side off for you, okay?

20:12.091 --> 20:12.271
Okay.

20:20.501 --> 20:25.385
Because the natto is really slimy and sticky and there's kind of like strings.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.047
Like magical strings that are made.

20:27.107 --> 20:28.027
Magical strings.

20:28.107 --> 20:28.468
Yeah.

20:28.908 --> 20:32.491
And see if it touches your lips or like the chest or anything.

20:32.571 --> 20:33.052
I hate it!

20:33.092 --> 20:34.733
Don't say that that's rude, Mococo-chan!

20:34.753 --> 20:35.854
Thank you, Tochigi!

20:38.116 --> 20:39.237
And it's really good.

20:39.717 --> 20:42.479
It's when it's still on my lips after eating it.

20:44.545 --> 20:45.846
What does it smell like, Moco-chan?

20:46.026 --> 20:47.186
I can't smell anything.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.827
My nose is broken, so this is good.

20:49.847 --> 20:51.287
Oh, this should be easy, then.

20:51.808 --> 20:59.791
I think it smells kind of like... The whole studio should be just smelling like natto, but I don't smell anything, so this is good.

21:00.231 --> 21:00.991
I'm hungry.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.311
Can you eat it, Moco-chan?

21:02.331 --> 21:03.432
You just have one bean!

21:03.452 --> 21:04.492
I have one bean!

21:04.552 --> 21:05.653
Okay, I have one bean.

21:05.733 --> 21:06.253
I'm prepared.

21:06.313 --> 21:07.573
Are you scared of one bean?

21:07.713 --> 21:08.934
I'm preparing my heart!

21:09.014 --> 21:09.454
Okay!

21:09.474 --> 21:10.374
Okay.

21:10.734 --> 21:11.215
Ruffians.

21:12.455 --> 21:13.735
You're gonna cheer for me, right?

21:13.755 --> 21:17.156
Moco-chan's gonna eat the one single natto bean.

21:17.416 --> 21:18.737
This will be a good improvement.

21:18.757 --> 21:19.217
Okay.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.237
It's not even fluffy.

21:20.517 --> 21:21.398
It's not fluffy yet.

21:21.718 --> 21:22.198
Okay.

21:22.898 --> 21:23.538
I'm gonna try it.

21:23.798 --> 21:25.539
Can you get my tissue ready just in case?

21:26.199 --> 21:27.139
I'm worried, okay?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.360
It's a tissue, not a bucket.

21:30.060 --> 21:30.700
Okay.

21:30.740 --> 21:33.602
Should I put it on my tongue, or just... Ah, you should eat it.

21:33.822 --> 21:34.882
That's the way.

21:35.222 --> 21:37.243
Eat it, and then we'll eat more.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.305
No, just eat it.

21:40.505 --> 21:40.685
Ah.

21:40.765 --> 21:41.765
You can't just swallow it.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.846
You have to make sure you savor it.

21:45.947 --> 21:46.407
Okay!

21:47.148 --> 21:47.888
Here we go!

21:48.168 --> 21:50.929
I'm gonna put it on the very back of my mouth.

21:50.949 --> 21:52.230
You need to taste it.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.011
No, this is getting ready.

21:54.751 --> 21:56.152
It's a small step, okay?

21:56.532 --> 21:57.292
Okay.

21:57.712 --> 21:58.773
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.247
Oh, now I can smell it.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.948
But I feel like I'm a bit more used to it.

22:02.968 --> 22:04.128
Because I smell it so often.

22:04.148 --> 22:04.948
So it's not that bad.

22:05.108 --> 22:05.388
Okay.

22:05.828 --> 22:06.208
Three!

22:06.308 --> 22:07.029
I'm not psyched!

22:08.409 --> 22:08.949
Three!

22:09.469 --> 22:09.729
Two!

22:09.809 --> 22:11.590
No, no, no, I want... From ten.

22:11.910 --> 22:12.730
From ten?

22:12.870 --> 22:15.231
Okay, Ruffians, let's all do it together, okay?

22:15.271 --> 22:16.131
From ten.

22:16.651 --> 22:17.031
Ten!

22:17.731 --> 22:18.171
Nine!

22:18.992 --> 22:19.212
Eight!

22:19.852 --> 22:20.392
Seven!

22:20.932 --> 22:21.252
Six!

22:21.992 --> 22:22.512
Five!

22:23.053 --> 22:23.573
Four!

22:24.153 --> 22:24.613
Three!

22:25.153 --> 22:25.513
Two!

22:25.533 --> 22:26.673
One!

22:26.733 --> 22:28.054
I'm out!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.544
You can do it, Moco-chan!

22:47.062 --> 22:48.923
That's so mean, Ruffian-chan.

22:49.403 --> 22:51.144
It's healthy, it's good for you.

22:51.184 --> 22:52.485
You're gonna scare the ruffians!

22:52.545 --> 22:53.866
I wanna eat it, okay?

22:54.146 --> 22:54.947
Another attempt.

22:55.587 --> 22:56.688
You have to do it again.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.888
That was so bad.

22:57.908 --> 22:58.769
I have tears.

22:59.429 --> 23:00.990
That was so bad.

23:01.090 --> 23:04.332
Can I have tea?

23:04.692 --> 23:06.033
No tea, you gotta eat it.

23:06.053 --> 23:06.874
I want tea!

23:08.533 --> 23:16.659
I don't know if the issue was that I put it on the back of my tongue, but then it went to the front of my tongue and then I don't know which was worse.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.681
I got it in my mouth though.

23:19.701 --> 23:21.502
That's good, you got it in your mouth.

23:21.982 --> 23:23.343
Eat it with rice like a normal person.

23:23.423 --> 23:24.644
I don't eat it with rice.

23:25.264 --> 23:26.805
Natto soup is good too.

23:27.266 --> 23:27.946
I'm trying.

23:27.966 --> 23:30.728
Moco-chan has to be as strong as me, so... I'm trying.

23:30.828 --> 23:31.569
I want to!

23:31.709 --> 23:32.429
I want to!

23:32.569 --> 23:33.330
Just do it again.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.491
No countdown this time.

23:35.151 --> 23:37.712
I feel like it's hurting my tummy.

23:38.372 --> 23:40.053
It's supposed to help my tummy.

23:40.073 --> 23:42.513
That's your emotions hurting your tummy, you know?

23:42.533 --> 23:44.274
I'll pick up another one.

23:44.614 --> 23:45.234
Another one?

23:45.254 --> 23:46.915
How about pick up three beans?

23:47.115 --> 23:48.355
No, it's so sticky.

23:48.435 --> 23:50.196
Yeah, because it's natto, you know?

23:50.216 --> 23:51.657
It's so sticky.

23:51.697 --> 23:52.377
It's natto.

23:52.877 --> 23:54.417
I don't want any other stickiness.

23:54.758 --> 23:55.558
There, it's gone.

24:00.353 --> 24:01.013
Three!

24:01.473 --> 24:01.593
Two!

24:01.653 --> 24:02.053
One!

24:02.694 --> 24:05.895
Wait, where should I put all my tongue?

24:06.335 --> 24:07.015
In your mouth.

24:08.255 --> 24:09.095
Should I chew it?

24:09.896 --> 24:10.536
You should chew it.

24:10.976 --> 24:13.737
Yeah, that way the ruffians can know how it truly tastes.

24:14.317 --> 24:15.577
Okay, I need you to hold this then.

24:15.677 --> 24:17.618
I need to have my tissue just in case.

24:18.338 --> 24:20.259
You don't trust me with the tissue anymore?

24:20.299 --> 24:20.939
I don't know.

24:21.039 --> 24:21.399
Okay.

24:21.579 --> 24:24.460
Because when I chew it, it's going to get sticky in my mouth, right?

24:25.020 --> 24:25.841
I don't know.

24:25.861 --> 24:27.821
The stickiness is just on the outside, I think.

24:28.682 --> 24:29.102
I don't know.

24:29.242 --> 24:30.102
It's like bean on the inside.

24:30.182 --> 24:32.963
Once the bean is in my mouth, then my mouth will be sticky too.

24:33.023 --> 24:33.543
It will be.

24:33.923 --> 24:34.324
Okay!

24:34.864 --> 24:35.404
Three!

24:35.784 --> 24:36.524
Okay, I'm going to do it.

24:36.564 --> 24:37.825
I'm going to do it.

24:37.845 --> 24:38.825
Two!

24:38.885 --> 24:39.125
One!

24:39.365 --> 24:39.885
In it goes!

24:40.466 --> 24:40.846
It's in there.

24:40.866 --> 24:42.126
It's on the tip of the tongue.

24:45.007 --> 24:46.008
Moco-chan!

24:46.028 --> 24:48.330
Eat properly!

24:48.971 --> 24:50.071
It got on my lips!

24:50.091 --> 24:52.974
What happened to your food?

24:53.074 --> 24:53.714
No, no!

24:53.774 --> 24:56.056
It was in my mouth but it was still on my lips!

24:56.096 --> 24:57.718
This is such a sad attempt.

24:57.738 --> 24:59.980
Can you even call this an attempt?

25:00.460 --> 25:01.361
I want tea!

25:01.601 --> 25:02.181
No tea!

25:02.241 --> 25:04.103
Not until you eat the whole 50 grams!

25:04.123 --> 25:04.183
No!

25:04.243 --> 25:04.824
Okay, you eat it.

25:04.924 --> 25:05.284
I give up.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.945
We'll challenge this again, okay?

25:06.985 --> 25:08.206
Hey!

25:08.446 --> 25:08.707
Hey!

25:08.927 --> 25:09.087
Okay!

25:09.487 --> 25:10.608
This was a success.

25:10.648 --> 25:14.652
This was a successful challenge because it was in my mouth, okay?

25:14.752 --> 25:15.593
It was in your mouth?

25:15.713 --> 25:15.973
Yeah.

25:16.894 --> 25:20.898
Next time, I'll properly eat one piece, okay?

25:21.178 --> 25:22.219
One piece?

25:22.239 --> 25:25.462
You gotta eat it all, Moco-chan.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.403
It was successful.

25:26.423 --> 25:27.604
Can I have tea?

25:27.904 --> 25:28.104
No.

25:28.865 --> 25:30.767
Not until you're fully successful.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.143
Challenge failed.

25:35.163 --> 25:35.223
No!

25:35.243 --> 25:37.626
This was successful.

25:37.646 --> 25:38.908
This was successful.

25:38.928 --> 25:39.909
It was.

25:43.243 --> 25:48.927
Thank you, Tochigi Farmers, for making delicious natto that I will be enjoying very much.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.108
Yeah, it's not a waste.

25:50.368 --> 25:51.268
Just the two pieces.

25:51.449 --> 25:52.269
BAU BAU!

25:52.309 --> 25:54.471
That was sad.

25:54.691 --> 25:55.331
That was sad.

25:55.451 --> 25:56.192
It wasn't.

25:56.612 --> 26:00.134
Welcome to our regular corner for today.

26:00.675 --> 26:04.257
Next, we have our Doggie of the Day!

26:04.617 --> 26:06.439
Which doggy is it today, Moco-chan?

26:08.065 --> 26:08.365
Den!

26:08.946 --> 26:12.187
It's Den!

26:12.247 --> 26:12.567
Ruffy!

26:12.607 --> 26:13.527
Ruffy, right!

26:13.667 --> 26:14.128
Den!

26:14.628 --> 26:15.588
Look at you!

26:15.988 --> 26:18.209
You too are fluffy!

26:18.849 --> 26:21.030
So fluffy, you almost rival me!

26:21.050 --> 26:21.611
Really?

26:21.731 --> 26:22.471
I think you're beat.

26:23.802 --> 26:24.023
What?

26:24.283 --> 26:24.603
No!

26:25.324 --> 26:28.146
I'm more fluffy than Ren, right?

26:28.166 --> 26:29.287
I think you're kidding yourself.

26:29.307 --> 26:30.328
Right, Ruffians?

26:31.309 --> 26:31.649
Right.

26:32.030 --> 26:34.232
But, you know, this is Ren right here.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.254
Just as she's waking up from a nap on the sofa.

26:37.314 --> 26:38.415
Very cute.

26:38.495 --> 26:40.057
I like good naps.

26:40.077 --> 26:40.677
Right?

26:41.058 --> 26:44.741
Just looking at this photo makes me want to curl up with her right there, right?

26:44.781 --> 26:45.061
Right!

26:45.421 --> 26:46.162
Good nap!

26:46.622 --> 26:47.423
All together!

26:47.483 --> 26:49.065
Right, the warm sunlight.

26:50.365 --> 26:58.832
Ben is a doggie made for taking midday naps with, you know?

26:59.473 --> 27:03.116
Silly, sleepy, smiley face.

27:03.416 --> 27:05.338
How do you think she BAU BAUs?

27:05.358 --> 27:09.302
I think it'd be sort of soft, like a blanket.

27:09.542 --> 27:12.985
Oh, like a very well-mannered BAU BAU like me?

27:13.045 --> 27:13.886
Like a fluffy one?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.128
Like, BAU BAU.

27:16.188 --> 27:16.368
Really?

27:16.408 --> 27:18.009
Like a... BAU BAU!

27:18.229 --> 27:18.430
No.

27:18.750 --> 27:18.950
No.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.871
BAU BAU.

27:20.411 --> 27:21.853
A bit, a bit warm sounding.

27:21.893 --> 27:22.853
Oh, a bit warm.

27:22.893 --> 27:23.154
Oh, indeed.

27:23.234 --> 27:24.995
Yeah.

27:25.436 --> 27:35.644
Well, I think, you know, then... If you're trying to avoid taking warm, comfy naps in the sun, then... Then maybe it'll get a bit tricky for you, but...

27:36.505 --> 27:42.968
Also, with Ren being by your side, I think every day will be filled with really good times.

27:43.269 --> 27:46.170
I suggest falling asleep together in the sun.

27:46.350 --> 27:50.312
BAU BAU!

27:51.253 --> 27:54.374
And next, let's see where our ruffians went for a walk.

27:56.027 --> 27:59.690
De-den!

28:00.150 --> 28:02.072
Look at those blue skies!

28:02.192 --> 28:02.932
So high up!

28:03.052 --> 28:04.794
And all the green too!

28:05.534 --> 28:07.316
It's beautiful!

28:08.377 --> 28:12.720
We're glad you took a moment out of your day to head over to the park maybe too!

28:12.940 --> 28:19.085
Even if it's just like a close-by park, you can always... It changes your mood so much, you know?

28:19.425 --> 28:22.688
I wonder though, do you think they have like a swing set or something there?

28:23.368 --> 28:28.789
I think that going on the swings while overlooking the scenery would be really, really fun.

28:28.929 --> 28:31.390
Although sometimes the swings can be super scary, right?

28:32.270 --> 28:34.190
It makes my tummy drop when I go too high.

28:35.851 --> 28:40.132
But you know, this is what good days are made of.

28:40.192 --> 28:44.432
It's hard not to be in a really good mood when the world around you is all like this, right?

28:44.612 --> 28:46.833
It feels like it looks sort of nostalgic.

28:48.635 --> 28:49.717
That's the feel I get.

28:49.857 --> 28:51.440
BAU BAU!

28:51.580 --> 28:52.422
Thank you!

28:52.442 --> 28:56.509
And next, we have our Question of the Day.

28:56.529 --> 28:57.211
What do we have?

28:58.482 --> 28:58.602
Oh!

28:59.363 --> 29:04.968
You've played Zelda on an N64, and will play a couple of games on PS2.

29:05.328 --> 29:10.373
What consoles do FUWAMOCO have access to, and would you like to play on stream if possible?

29:10.873 --> 29:13.335
Any consoles or portables you wish you had?

29:14.997 --> 29:23.685
Our consoles, well, we worked really hard to save up for a lot of them, but either we have our SNES, you know that,

29:24.889 --> 29:26.170
Bored with, right?

29:26.490 --> 29:27.910
But the one we have right now, I think?

29:28.330 --> 29:28.691
I think?

29:29.051 --> 29:30.511
It's not the original one.

29:30.571 --> 29:32.172
It's the second in line.

29:32.252 --> 29:34.213
Yeah, the first one is still old.

29:34.453 --> 29:39.375
Yeah, the first one kind of didn't make it away, luckily, you know?

29:39.415 --> 29:40.055
But that's okay.

29:40.075 --> 29:41.596
We have a good second one now.

29:42.096 --> 29:44.577
And our original N64 we still have.

29:44.877 --> 29:47.758
And we have a thick US PS2.

29:47.798 --> 29:49.299
Yeah, very thick.

29:49.819 --> 29:50.379
Chubby one.

29:50.639 --> 29:54.361
And then we have a thin white Japanese PS2 as well.

29:55.621 --> 29:59.322
We have a Wii somewhere.

29:59.342 --> 30:00.223
I don't know where that is.

30:00.323 --> 30:03.824
I guess Mama Puppy has a Wii U so maybe that kind of counts.

30:04.744 --> 30:05.104
Right?

30:05.204 --> 30:09.066
And then we also have a PS3 and a PS4.

30:09.706 --> 30:13.147
Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy got that as part of a deal and then they just kind of...

30:13.567 --> 30:18.330
Gave that to us right before we went into the cell, so really we haven't used that.

30:18.370 --> 30:19.410
We're not very touched.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.232
And then we have a slate!

30:22.252 --> 30:29.536
As for handhelds, I guess... We had a Game Boy Color, and DS Lite, and...

30:31.007 --> 30:35.691
Maybe you've heard of it, maybe not, but we had an Atari Lynx.

30:35.811 --> 30:37.192
Yeah!

30:37.272 --> 30:42.496
But it was kind of hard to play with, and it took a lot of batteries, it was really heavy.

30:42.556 --> 30:43.837
Really big, yeah.

30:43.937 --> 30:45.478
You need muscle for it.

30:45.779 --> 30:48.261
You know, we didn't really understand the game that we had.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.443
I think it was something like Gauntlet?

30:51.803 --> 30:52.504
Only one game.

30:52.784 --> 30:53.385
Yeah, so...

30:54.218 --> 30:55.419
We don't have it anymore.

30:56.739 --> 30:58.100
It was really, really big.

30:59.180 --> 31:02.561
But I think if we could have any console that we don't have.

31:03.742 --> 31:04.342
Console?

31:04.362 --> 31:04.962
I don't know.

31:05.082 --> 31:09.264
Not really a console, but we'd really like to have a PC-98.

31:09.284 --> 31:09.464
PC-98.

31:09.744 --> 31:14.686
You know, if we could play PC-98 games together with Ruffians, that would be really fun.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.167
I don't think that's gonna happen ever.

31:17.187 --> 31:18.388
I don't even...

31:19.568 --> 31:28.711
I think in general we really do like games, but maybe we're not the greatest at them.

31:28.891 --> 31:30.051
We're not very good at them.

31:30.991 --> 31:32.232
But fun is fun!

31:32.372 --> 31:34.012
We have lots of respect and love.

31:38.133 --> 31:38.474
BAU BAU!

31:38.514 --> 31:38.954
Thank you!

31:38.974 --> 31:40.676
Thank you for the question!

31:58.414 --> 32:04.921
Ruffians, as you know, we're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, Doggie of the Day, your walks.

32:05.622 --> 32:07.804
Please, please keep on asking, okay?

32:08.084 --> 32:10.046
Keep on sending your stuff, okay?

32:10.126 --> 32:11.468
Asking the questions, you know?

32:12.168 --> 32:13.630
BAU BAU!

32:14.411 --> 32:18.275
And for our next team, Moco-chan, what do we have coming up here?

32:18.295 --> 32:18.435
We have...

32:20.598 --> 32:24.220
Minecraft!

32:24.700 --> 32:25.900
Revenge.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.801
Revenge is nothing scary.

32:29.302 --> 32:32.523
Last time, things didn't quite go as planned.

32:32.563 --> 32:36.485
There were a couple bumps that prevented us from doing what we set out to do.

32:36.885 --> 32:39.746
But this time, there won't be any issues, right?

32:40.507 --> 32:40.707
Right.

32:41.508 --> 32:41.769
Right!

32:42.250 --> 32:49.664
We're gonna do lots of exploring with as much excitement, you know, just like the day we broke out of the cell, right?

32:50.285 --> 32:51.307
That much excitement.

32:51.347 --> 32:52.429
Where's Nerissa?

32:53.631 --> 32:54.052
I don't know.

32:55.219 --> 32:57.882
Yeah, let's take a look at what I said by the beginning.

32:58.022 --> 32:58.503
Okay.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.986
And hopefully we won't touch anything.

33:01.046 --> 33:04.530
Well, for Minecraft, it's revenge.

33:05.391 --> 33:07.174
But, I haven't forgotten.

33:09.857 --> 33:10.598
I forgot what?

33:11.499 --> 33:12.200
Did you forget?

33:14.443 --> 33:15.424
I haven't forgotten.

33:15.444 --> 33:17.425
But you know what?

33:17.886 --> 33:20.768
I'm gonna wait until she forgets.

33:21.549 --> 33:25.872
And then, when she's not expecting it.

33:26.973 --> 33:27.594
Someday.

33:28.875 --> 33:29.715
I'll make her pay.

33:30.416 --> 33:31.136
What do they say?

33:31.156 --> 33:34.319
Revenge is a dish best served cold?

33:35.560 --> 33:35.880
What?

33:36.961 --> 33:37.381
Slow.

33:37.962 --> 33:38.282
Slow.

33:38.682 --> 33:39.663
Yeah.

33:39.723 --> 33:40.644
Slow and cold.

33:41.024 --> 33:41.164
Yeah.

33:43.627 --> 33:45.428
Let's take a look at our schedule too.

33:45.488 --> 33:47.129
It's a new schedule.

33:47.429 --> 33:47.969
Yeah!

33:48.049 --> 33:52.271
This week we're going to be playing a bunch of games and a bunch of new games too.

33:52.571 --> 33:54.772
We have the Cruising Shift.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.033
We're going to become baristas.

33:56.053 --> 33:56.173
Yeah!

33:56.413 --> 33:58.194
I want to do latte art.

33:58.454 --> 34:00.134
Before we could do like a heart.

34:00.234 --> 34:01.615
Here's your latte.

34:02.115 --> 34:03.717
I do it just for you!

34:03.797 --> 34:06.219
You just gonna drink it like that?

34:06.259 --> 34:07.320
You're not gonna take a photo?

34:07.380 --> 34:09.622
What is wrong with you?

34:09.782 --> 34:14.446
We'll also be doing our best on the weekend because we're gonna be studying a bunch of kanji.

34:14.526 --> 34:17.209
Hopefully we're gonna be learning some new words.

34:17.229 --> 34:24.015
There's still a lot that we don't know so hopefully this can be kind of a first step towards passing our

34:24.575 --> 34:26.316
JLPT N1, you know?

34:26.596 --> 34:27.816
Good study session.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.677
It's gonna be really hard though.

34:30.037 --> 34:32.298
A lot of our senpai have been playing it.
