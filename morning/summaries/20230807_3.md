Just after one week of being released, FUWAMOCO's [cover of YOASOBI's "Kaibutsu"](https://youtu.be/Yr1EI_jYBB8) has reached 1 million views! They thank all the people who made the MV possible, as well as the Ruffians for helping them reach this milestone. And that's not all: another cover is in the works!

## üì¢ Starting Voice Packs ([09:26](https://youtu.be/Nph4ogfhuBE?t=09m26s))

FUWAMOCO thank all the Ruffians who have bought [Fuwawa](https://shop.hololivepro.com/en/products/starting-voice-fuwawa-abyssgard) and [Mococo](https://shop.hololivepro.com/en/products/starting-voice-mococo-abyssgard)'s Starting Voice Packs. If you're one of them, what was your favorite voice?

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([13:01](https://youtu.be/Nph4ogfhuBE?t=13m01s))

As disappointing as it is (for FUWAMOCO anyways), they have to clear up another set of misunderstandings:

* 13:01: Mococo [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/live/A2e3ljDAxmQ?si=3rbM8YZgLquHObCm&t=6108) that [sukumizu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sukumizu) + scarf was the best combo for an outfit, but she missed a crucial item in that statement: glasses! [Fubuki would be proud of that statement!](https://youtu.be/lWVt0YnSYEY)
* 14:13: Meanwhile, Fuwawa feels she needs to clarify that, rather than sukumizu + socks alone, a bandage on top of those makes for a great outfit; even better if there's a green bangle on the wrist, too!
* 14:57: The biggest of all misunderstandings today would be however when Fuwawa said they'd put "the dog into the monkey" for their 'Donkey Kong' stream, as she meant to say it in a similar fashion to say "putting the X into 'Xbox'". Hopefully that clears up everything (?).

## üè† FUWAMOCO Home ([17:58](https://youtu.be/Nph4ogfhuBE?t=17m58s))

Guided by some drawings carefully crafted by Mococo, the twins describe their homeland, the Northwest Passage, a land that exists within the Makai, the demon world. It's a place full of trees, with a usually-rainy-but-otherwise-nice, breezy weather overall. At their home, they live along with Mama puppy and Papa puppy; no other siblings. And no, [Mama puppy and Papa puppy are not single](https://youtu.be/Nph4ogfhuBE?t=17m58s).

[@3nen2kumi](https://twitter.com/3nen2kumi/status/1687490262325669888) finds a little kitten while taking a break during a trip they did.

## ‚ùì Question Of The Day ([28:00](https://youtu.be/Nph4ogfhuBE?t=28m00s))

[LILOLULI](https://twitter.com/LILOLULI0/status/1688384028263489536) asks Mococo for her thoughts about her nickname 'Moco' meaning 'booger' in Spanish. She only comments that it's embarrassing and prefers to be called 'Moco-chan' rather than 'Moco' just as-is.
