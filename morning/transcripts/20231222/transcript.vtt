06:11.738 --> 06:12.859
I can't believe it.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.181
It feels like it was just the 50th episode the other day.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.101
I don't know.

06:17.221 --> 06:20.223
It feels like we started everything every day.

06:20.883 --> 06:21.424
Wow!

06:21.464 --> 06:32.010
Ruffians, for those of you who are joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

BAU BAU!

06:56.024 --> 06:57.644
FUWAMOCO-chan.

06:59.225 --> 07:01.086
Christmas is just around the corner.

07:01.727 --> 07:03.308
Is there anything you're looking forward to?

07:06.983 --> 07:08.664
Are you trying to embarrass me?

07:08.684 --> 07:10.946
I don't know.

07:10.966 --> 07:16.751
Well... I think there's been another Pero Sighting!

07:16.791 --> 07:18.972
How are you not gonna answer my question?

07:19.373 --> 07:20.153
It's embarrassing!

07:20.173 --> 07:20.814
Pero Sighting.

07:32.230 --> 07:33.371
Yikes.

07:33.951 --> 07:34.812
Ruffians.

07:36.333 --> 07:36.754
Yikes?

07:37.454 --> 07:38.935
That's what you have to say.

07:41.037 --> 07:41.738
Ruffians.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.481
You have some interesting tastes, you know.

07:47.102 --> 07:49.043
Pero, what are you doing?

07:49.063 --> 07:54.147
You know, you were just helping the kids, and now... Huh?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.670
You were hearing what kind of gifts they wanted the other day.

07:59.690 --> 08:02.992
And now... This.

08:04.313 --> 08:05.634
Bikini modeling!

08:06.234 --> 08:07.355
Sweater modeling!

08:07.455 --> 08:12.939
Why is he making that face too?

08:13.499 --> 08:14.260
It's sort of like...

08:14.881 --> 08:20.363
He doesn't have the confidence in himself for, like, maybe... He pities the Ruffians!

08:20.483 --> 08:22.643
Boldy displaying this calendar!

08:23.564 --> 08:24.664
Those rosy cheeks.

08:26.384 --> 08:27.705
I think he knows what he's up to.

08:28.645 --> 08:34.667
But, you know, also, Moco-chan, look at his little wings, you know?

08:34.687 --> 08:37.368
They're doing their best!

08:37.688 --> 08:38.048
Yeah!

08:39.048 --> 08:40.349
I see it!

08:40.549 --> 08:42.129
It's a little bit tight, yeah?

08:42.169 --> 08:44.230
Yeah, it looks a little rough on them, but...

08:44.850 --> 08:48.672
You know, yeah, maybe we shouldn't be too hard on Pero.

08:49.292 --> 08:49.552
Right?

08:49.652 --> 08:51.253
He's trying something new.

08:51.673 --> 08:55.555
You know, it's not easy being a bikini model when you're Pero, right?

08:55.595 --> 08:56.475
When you're Pero.

08:56.615 --> 08:56.995
Yeah.

08:57.275 --> 09:00.877
Well, thank you for sharing his debut link with us.

09:03.318 --> 09:04.138
Thank you, Ruffians.

09:04.158 --> 09:06.239
I don't know if we need that.

09:06.279 --> 09:06.719
BAU BAU!

09:06.779 --> 09:07.920
BAU BAU!

09:11.530 --> 09:13.912
Well, Ruffians, let's just forget about that.

09:14.293 --> 09:19.498
Pero Sighting, I think of something much happier because guess what, Ruffians?

09:19.698 --> 09:29.848
Well, you might know, but we released both of our solo versions of Cute na Kanojo!

09:29.928 --> 09:31.470
BAU BAU BAU!

09:31.510 --> 09:32.511
Did you listen?

09:32.611 --> 09:33.432
What did you think?

09:35.536 --> 09:41.664
You know, Ruffians, we swear we weren't able to be there in the premiere with you, but we were there in spirit!

09:44.652 --> 09:46.453
Thank you for listening!

09:47.494 --> 09:50.116
BAU BAU!

09:50.156 --> 09:54.519
We hope that you enjoyed them a lot and that you listen to them over and over and over, okay?

09:55.859 --> 10:02.384
You know, it's interesting because you can see, you know, how Fuwawa sings something versus how I sing something.

10:03.284 --> 10:06.286
It wasn't really possible to do that before.

10:06.626 --> 10:12.070
So now, Ruffians, you shouldn't have any problems telling our voices apart, right?

10:15.031 --> 10:15.391
BAU BAU!

10:26.544 --> 10:26.904
That was awesome!

10:27.164 --> 10:27.384
Thank you!

10:27.404 --> 10:27.724

10:50.008 --> 10:50.268
Thank you!

10:50.288 --> 10:50.868
That was awesome!

10:50.888 --> 10:51.069
Thank you!

10:51.109 --> 10:51.829
That was awesome!

10:51.849 --> 10:52.169
Thank you!

10:52.189 --> 10:52.669
That was awesome!

10:52.729 --> 10:52.949
Thank you!

10:52.969 --> 10:53.369
That was awesome!

10:53.889 --> 10:55.890
A little bit nervous, too.

10:56.310 --> 11:00.351
And also, Ruffians, if you're nearby, we hope that you'll come and see us!

11:00.612 --> 11:00.872
Yeah!

11:00.892 --> 11:02.672
You know, right?

11:02.712 --> 11:03.453
If you're nearby.

11:03.693 --> 11:04.873
If you're nearby, okay.

11:05.453 --> 11:06.754
Yeah, it might be tricky.

11:06.774 --> 11:11.335
You know, this time of year, I think everybody's going everywhere, right?

11:11.455 --> 11:15.597
Yeah, but we'll be having a big panel there!

11:15.957 --> 11:19.318
And there'll be like a Q&A and a mini welcome party!

11:19.338 --> 11:21.319
So we hope that you'll be ready with

11:21.579 --> 11:22.180
BAU BAU!

11:22.240 --> 11:22.700
BAU BAU!

11:22.840 --> 11:23.421
BAU BAU!

11:34.221 --> 11:39.664
Only get at the event, so don't forget to get your paws on them too, okay?

11:39.685 --> 11:43.747
Moco-chan, are you okay?

11:43.807 --> 11:45.208
Suddenly a dragon!

11:45.228 --> 11:50.191
That's how excited you are, huh?

11:50.271 --> 11:51.292
That excited, huh?

11:51.312 --> 11:52.292
BAU BAU!

11:52.312 --> 11:56.675
We hope to see you at Comiket!

11:56.795 --> 11:57.916
I'm so excited, but...

12:02.134 --> 12:04.175
I'm a little nervous too, oh my gosh.

12:05.196 --> 12:07.117
It'll be okay though, Moco-chan.

12:07.157 --> 12:07.617
Yeah.

12:08.418 --> 12:09.578
Well, Ruffians.

12:11.059 --> 12:19.163
I'm not too sure about in Malaysia about the... the situation regarding this.

12:19.924 --> 12:20.184
But!

12:20.844 --> 12:21.805
Well...

12:22.585 --> 12:31.968
Pororo onee-chan just had a brand new episode of Legend of Pororo Cup.

12:33.068 --> 12:41.031
And she talked all about the situation of hololive members and how they dip their nuggets.

12:41.091 --> 12:44.052
Very gripping, very important information.

12:44.412 --> 12:48.813
The most important of information about Ruffians.

12:49.313 --> 12:50.874
Do you slice?

12:52.410 --> 12:53.271
How much sauce?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.632
You know, it was that sort of important information.

12:56.712 --> 12:57.553
Important, yeah.

12:57.573 --> 13:00.574
And you know, FUWAMOCO, we were featured too!

13:00.694 --> 13:00.994
Yeah!

13:01.054 --> 13:04.996
Just, uh, maybe for the Ruffians who can't read Japanese.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.457
Is this an English subtitle?

13:06.737 --> 13:06.917
No.

13:07.037 --> 13:07.237
No?

13:07.377 --> 13:07.577
Okay.

13:08.118 --> 13:08.818
Safe.

13:08.858 --> 13:09.178
Safe.

13:10.018 --> 13:16.181
Ruffians, how do you feel that FUWAMOCO feels towards sauce on nuggets?

13:17.342 --> 13:17.442
Oh.

13:23.972 --> 13:24.873
You use enough?

13:24.893 --> 13:26.334
What is enough?

13:26.354 --> 13:30.619
Mococo probably drenches it.

13:35.803 --> 13:37.144
Can't get enough sauce?

13:37.624 --> 13:38.124
No!

13:38.504 --> 13:42.446
Well, FUWAMOCO, we're no sauce!

13:42.606 --> 13:43.827
No sauce!

13:43.867 --> 13:48.049
You know, we like to taste the flavor of the animal, of the meat.

13:48.069 --> 13:51.470
You know, if we wanted to taste sauce, then we'd just have sauce, huh?

13:51.510 --> 13:55.812
You know, this is a time for the meat to shine, not the sauce.

13:55.892 --> 13:57.313
Not the sauce, you know.

13:58.533 --> 14:04.276
Ruffians, why are you making that face?

14:04.676 --> 14:11.519
It's not like we really have nuggets very often, but when we do, there is never any sauce involved.

14:11.719 --> 14:13.860
Do you understand, Ruffians?

14:14.758 --> 14:17.399
Yeah, don't you feel like it's kind of rude to use sauce?

14:17.519 --> 14:17.879
Right.

14:18.259 --> 14:20.360
You know, think of what the nugget wants the most.

14:20.380 --> 14:20.760
Right!

14:20.800 --> 14:22.180
What the nugget wants!

14:22.521 --> 14:25.001
It wants to have its time to be enjoyed.

14:25.141 --> 14:25.542
Uh-huh.

14:25.702 --> 14:27.182
Think about the nuggets feeling okay.

14:27.202 --> 14:30.723
Yeah, and then the sauce just comes along, it's gonna steal its spotlight.

14:31.243 --> 14:31.764
You know.

14:32.364 --> 14:33.204
We can't have that.

14:33.224 --> 14:34.404
We can't have that.

14:34.444 --> 14:38.926
Yeah, so we do what's kindest, and we eat it with no sauce.

14:39.266 --> 14:40.246
Honey mustard?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.467
No way!

14:41.487 --> 14:41.967
Disgusting.

14:43.177 --> 14:45.203
No, this is the best way.

14:45.404 --> 14:46.406
The kindest way.

14:46.988 --> 14:48.874
BAU BAU!

14:52.620 --> 14:53.281
Why yuck?

14:53.381 --> 14:53.981
Why yuck?

14:54.021 --> 14:54.802
Why yuck?

14:55.282 --> 14:55.623
How?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.344
Do you not like nuggets?

14:57.424 --> 15:00.366
Why are you eating nuggets if you say yuck?

15:00.806 --> 15:02.848
How can you be so mean to the nuggets?

15:02.888 --> 15:03.328
Right.

15:03.729 --> 15:04.930
Wow, Ruffians.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.591
You're kind of rude, huh?

15:07.171 --> 15:10.273
They just woke up and they decided to say, I'm gonna be rude!

15:10.313 --> 15:11.034
Yeah!

15:11.534 --> 15:12.655
Rude to the nuggets.

15:12.795 --> 15:13.776
Oh my goodness.

15:15.878 --> 15:16.638
Well, BAU BAU.

15:19.051 --> 15:25.314
Well, Ruffians, just because of that, we have something new for you.

15:25.795 --> 15:30.517
We have a new challenge.

15:31.177 --> 15:37.161
This might be, you know, Ruffians, if you like to have sauce on your nuggets, maybe the new challenge is no sauce.

15:37.681 --> 15:38.761
But!

15:39.422 --> 15:46.686
Well, to explain, you know, at the beginning of the week, Moco-chan challenges herself to overcome her dislike of natto, right?

15:48.112 --> 15:53.015
Yeah, recently, Moco-chan, thanks to the sesame oil, right?

15:53.215 --> 15:55.957
Things have started to somehow... Start!

15:56.057 --> 15:56.997
Go better, right?

15:57.237 --> 15:58.058
It's starting.

15:58.078 --> 15:58.938
Starting, yeah.

15:59.499 --> 16:01.900
Yeah, we're all super surprised, right?

16:01.940 --> 16:02.120
Yeah!

16:02.180 --> 16:04.282
Natsu is not done.

16:04.962 --> 16:08.144
Yeah, it was kinda looking like we're starting to go back with Moco-chan.

16:08.224 --> 16:08.424
A bit.

16:08.444 --> 16:11.446
That there's starting to be some trauma forming.

16:12.186 --> 16:16.589
Yeah, but, you know, since you started to get the hang of it, Ruffian?

16:17.643 --> 16:22.225
Next Monday, we'll be changing things up!

16:22.605 --> 16:23.806
Changing it!

16:24.086 --> 16:26.907
We want you to join us in the challenge though, okay?

16:28.328 --> 16:37.112
This time, we'll be challenging ourselves, both of us, to... Eggnog!

16:41.734 --> 16:42.455
Ruffians!

16:42.595 --> 16:44.716
You better get ready too, okay?

16:45.925 --> 16:47.407
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

16:59.673 --> 17:00.653
Smells really bad.

17:01.834 --> 17:04.214
But we're gonna do our best!

17:04.594 --> 17:06.535
So please join us, Ruffians!

17:06.795 --> 17:08.735
You know, whether you like it or not.

17:10.596 --> 17:16.998
It might be the holidays, you know, but really, that doesn't mean we can stop challenging ourselves to new things, okay?

17:18.998 --> 17:20.038
Just eggnog!

17:20.179 --> 17:21.019
Just eggnog!

17:21.259 --> 17:22.559
Just straight eggnog.

17:23.039 --> 17:25.200
No adding milk, no adding water.

17:26.127 --> 17:26.927
Just eggnog.

17:27.687 --> 17:29.328
Not eggnog annatto.

17:29.668 --> 17:29.888
No.

17:30.388 --> 17:30.628
No.

17:31.988 --> 17:32.349
No.

17:32.589 --> 17:34.469
Homie, that sounds dangerous.

17:35.969 --> 17:38.050
From the store.

17:38.790 --> 17:39.210
Yeah.

17:41.631 --> 17:42.151
Safety.

17:42.531 --> 17:44.311
We're importing our specialty, okay?

17:44.351 --> 17:46.832
Because it's hard to get in the Northwest Passage.

17:47.492 --> 17:49.953
So, we hope that you'll join us, okay?

17:49.973 --> 17:51.273
BAU BAU!

17:51.353 --> 17:52.694
BAU BAU!

17:55.663 --> 18:01.550
Ruffians, it seems like we got an important news scoop!

18:01.690 --> 18:05.715
Thank you for the impeccable journalism!

18:05.815 --> 18:12.583
Ruffians, it seems like there is a big update to FUWAMOCO!

18:13.304 --> 18:15.466
It's a very special event going on right now.

18:16.668 --> 18:18.210
And me, Mococo!

18:18.731 --> 18:19.872
I'm a part of it!

18:19.952 --> 18:22.556
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

18:22.596 --> 18:29.945
This time the cave screen is icy and slippery, so only the hololive members who had the best deciding are a part of it.

18:30.466 --> 18:32.268
That means I'm a part of it.

18:33.650 --> 18:39.111
You know, it's actually a super fun update, so if you haven't played it yet, you really should.

18:39.131 --> 18:40.272
Yeah.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.512
You know, you can even play it on mobile too!

18:43.933 --> 18:46.093
You know, I actually really like it so much.

18:46.653 --> 18:48.774
I hope they'll leave it in the game forever.

18:49.074 --> 18:49.774
It's pretty fun.

18:49.974 --> 18:50.474
Yeah.

18:50.514 --> 18:52.735
You know, it's really unique and refreshing.

18:52.755 --> 18:55.295
It kind of changes things up a lot.

18:55.355 --> 18:58.076
So, please try it out, okay?

18:58.096 --> 18:59.816
You need to try it out, Ruffians!

19:00.296 --> 19:00.697
BAU BAU!

19:04.338 --> 19:05.899
Can you believe it, Moco-chan?

19:05.919 --> 19:09.802
It's already a very fluffy and fuzzy part of the day.

19:09.942 --> 19:14.165
We have our... Doggie of the Day!

19:14.405 --> 19:15.906
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

19:16.146 --> 19:21.450
The Doggie of the Day today is... Tiny!

19:21.530 --> 19:22.430
Very cute.

19:22.530 --> 19:26.413
I don't know though, I don't think Tiny is so tiny.

19:26.953 --> 19:28.614
No, look at those ears!

19:28.855 --> 19:31.516
But what about Tiny's tiny chat I have?

19:33.358 --> 19:35.139
I guess it's sort of tiny.

19:35.299 --> 19:35.759
It's cute.

19:36.580 --> 19:40.743
A tiny Santa hat on a big tiny.

19:40.783 --> 19:41.464
Right?

19:42.184 --> 19:44.746
How does tiny BAU BAU?

19:46.107 --> 19:46.728
Tiny maybe.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.289
You think it's tiny BAU BAU?

19:48.629 --> 19:49.630
I don't think so.

19:49.650 --> 19:53.633
Maybe tiny is excited for the holidays and that's what a big BAU BAU.

19:56.109 --> 19:56.930
BAU BAU!

19:57.610 --> 19:58.551
BAU BAU!

19:58.991 --> 20:00.432
BAU BAU!

20:01.052 --> 20:03.574
I don't know, is that gonna get tiny lots of tweets?

20:04.195 --> 20:06.256
I don't know, but that's just how you BAU BAU.

20:09.538 --> 20:10.559
Maybe in between.

20:10.579 --> 20:11.760
Maybe.

20:11.880 --> 20:12.481
Maybe.

20:12.541 --> 20:19.287
But you know Tiny is ready to see all his relatives and loved ones for Christmas.

20:19.467 --> 20:20.788
Especially with that hat.

20:21.168 --> 20:29.395
And you know, he wants to get lots of head pads and sheets so he's making sure to smell like a fresh dog and not like a wet dog.

20:29.475 --> 20:30.396
Yeah, yeah.

20:30.476 --> 20:30.757
Yeah.

20:31.857 --> 20:36.859
And you know, how could you not want to give him some treats when he looks super cute at that height?

20:36.879 --> 20:37.299
Right.

20:37.999 --> 20:40.880
He doesn't need to have a super amazing cute BAU BAU.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.581
It can be a big BAU BAU because he's very very cute.

20:45.181 --> 20:46.702
Cute, cute.

20:47.382 --> 20:48.783
BAU BAU!

20:48.803 --> 20:52.184
And for today, I went on a walk.

20:52.224 --> 20:54.885
We have... De-den!

20:59.571 --> 21:01.432
That is a very big tree.

21:02.273 --> 21:04.954
That is a very massive tree!

21:05.534 --> 21:10.197
You know, it's almost as big as some of the trees you see here in the northwest passes.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.918
But this one is much prettier, you know.

21:12.958 --> 21:15.500
Look at the star on the top, too.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.081
Why is it so big?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.082
I wonder how many lights are on the tree.

21:20.643 --> 21:22.003
Did somebody count it?

21:22.984 --> 21:25.105
I think Moco-chan has too many to count.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.507
Ruffians!

21:27.747 --> 21:29.609
You should count it for Moco-chan, okay?

21:29.629 --> 21:33.732
But Ruffians count how many times we say BAU BAU, so... That's true.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.755
It's possible we could count how many likes there are on the tweet.

21:36.895 --> 21:37.135
Yeah.

21:37.836 --> 21:38.377
I think so.

21:38.737 --> 21:40.058
Get to it, Ruffians!

21:41.679 --> 21:42.020
Bye!

21:42.080 --> 21:44.702
Thank you for sharing with us!

21:44.782 --> 21:45.923
BAU BAU!

21:46.984 --> 21:52.085
And for our Question of the Day today, we have De-den!

21:52.565 --> 21:53.506
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

21:53.586 --> 21:54.286
Hello!

21:54.466 --> 21:58.607
My question is, you know, different hololives have different chat vibes.

21:59.007 --> 22:03.728
Example, the vibes in Biboo's chat is very different from Shiori's chat.

22:04.108 --> 22:05.909
How would you describe the Ruffians' vibes?

22:08.069 --> 22:13.131
I don't think you really thought of it that much, but... Comfy.

22:13.711 --> 22:14.371
Cozy.

22:14.511 --> 22:14.871
Silly.

22:15.256 --> 22:16.517
Silly, very silly.

22:17.438 --> 22:18.099
Silly!

22:18.119 --> 22:21.542
Just us together with the Ruffians?

22:21.822 --> 22:22.343
Yeah!

22:22.443 --> 22:24.285
And rather well-behaved too.

22:24.565 --> 22:25.406
Maybe sometimes.

22:25.546 --> 22:29.149
Maybe today you're a bit rude though about the sauce and the nuggets.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.861
Yeah, but rather well-behaved.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.481
Yeah, we like it very much.

22:36.581 --> 22:38.402
Thank you!

22:38.502 --> 22:39.142
Thank you!

22:39.482 --> 22:40.162
BAU BAU!

22:40.242 --> 22:42.443
That's too easy of an answer.

22:42.483 --> 22:44.624
I don't know it's easy to answer.

22:44.684 --> 22:45.704
It's easy to answer.

22:45.724 --> 22:47.224
What can we do?

22:47.264 --> 22:48.745
Ruffians don't make it hard for us.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.105
No, no.

22:50.665 --> 22:54.887
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

22:54.947 --> 22:57.768
Please remember, if you have any questions, ask us.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.169
If you have any... Oh, this would make a good scoop!

23:00.590 --> 23:03.571
Please put it in the FWMC scoop hashtag.

23:03.851 --> 23:12.515
Your doggies are looking very cute for the holidays, and your walks are very festive, and, uh, well, your pero... Pero Sightings are... interesting.

23:13.871 --> 23:15.792
Please don't forget, okay?

23:15.852 --> 23:17.493
BAU BAU!

23:18.054 --> 23:20.836
Well, for our next theme, we have...

23:23.106 --> 23:25.488
We have de-den!

23:25.989 --> 23:27.110
School Days!

23:27.310 --> 23:34.397
We're gonna be watching all of the School Days anime tonight from start to finish.

23:34.677 --> 23:35.798
We're really excited!

23:36.399 --> 23:42.225
It's an anime that's very special to us, that we like, and we like to watch it over Christmas.

23:45.256 --> 23:48.477
As you might know, a lot of things have happened this past year.

23:49.077 --> 23:51.939
And we can't really remember all that great anymore.

23:52.079 --> 23:55.540
And I didn't watch it last year because I was doing something else.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.660
I don't know what I was doing.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.861
You wanted to do something else.

23:57.881 --> 23:59.081
Maybe I was playing a game.

23:59.181 --> 23:59.661
I don't know.

24:00.722 --> 24:06.124
But, you know, that means it'll be like watching it for the first time again with you FUWAMOCO.

24:06.444 --> 24:11.486
So, let's all get ready nice and cozy and prepare for some nice food!

24:11.766 --> 24:12.386
BAU BAU!

24:15.715 --> 24:17.175
And our schedule!

24:17.195 --> 24:22.336
If we take a look at our schedule, there's not many days left before Christmas.

24:22.917 --> 24:26.577
As you know, we have some big plans for Christmas Eve too.

24:26.597 --> 24:29.918
Ruffians, are you gonna spend it with us?

24:30.078 --> 24:38.120
Well, you know, this time we're trying something a bit different, so we really hope that you'll be there live with us.

24:39.580 --> 24:45.982
But, you know, if your family is like, no, Ruffian, I want you for Christmas, then you go with your family, okay?

24:46.062 --> 24:46.422
Okay.

24:46.442 --> 24:50.523
That'd be pretty funny if they called you Ruffian.

24:50.643 --> 24:57.824
But, we'd be really happy if you could join us because it is Christmas Eve with you, after all, so... BAU BAU!

24:59.465 --> 25:02.786
Please look forward to it!

25:03.526 --> 25:08.647
Wow, before we know it, today's FUWAMOCO Morning comes to a close!

25:09.793 --> 25:13.736
We hope that you're gonna have a very happy holiday with us Ruffians.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.137
It's almost the weekend.

25:15.577 --> 25:16.798
Almost.

25:17.358 --> 25:23.962
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

25:24.583 --> 25:25.383
