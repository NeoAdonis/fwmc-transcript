05:20.430 --> 05:22.730
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:23.150 --> 05:26.935
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:26.955 --> 05:30.479
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:30.619 --> 05:32.862
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:35.832 --> 05:38.654
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:39.054 --> 05:41.715
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:41.795 --> 05:44.716
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:44.756 --> 05:46.257
BAU BAU!

05:46.737 --> 05:51.640
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:51.660 --> 05:54.581
Ruffians.

05:54.821 --> 05:55.402
Good morning.

05:56.102 --> 05:59.544
Thank you for joining us for our 41st episode!

05:59.624 --> 06:00.064
BAU BAU!

06:04.965 --> 06:08.227
Our 41st episode and 101st stream.

06:08.247 --> 06:10.108
Still lots of stuff to do!

06:12.529 --> 06:15.231
Ruffians, in case maybe you forgot.

06:15.611 --> 06:17.072
Oh, we definitely forgot.

06:17.112 --> 06:24.836
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:25.077 --> 06:25.657
A.K.A.

06:25.717 --> 06:26.637
FUWAMOCO Live!

06:27.118 --> 06:29.499
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:31.520 --> 06:36.644
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:37.105 --> 06:42.689
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:43.369 --> 06:45.451
Ruffians, are you ready?

06:46.212 --> 06:46.752
You awake?

06:47.192 --> 06:48.654
Ready to BAU BAU?

06:48.674 --> 06:50.255
A brand new day.

06:50.655 --> 06:51.516
BAU BAU!

06:52.296 --> 06:56.440
Well, let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:56.920 --> 06:58.661
BAU BAU!

07:01.092 --> 07:02.893
And with that, the morning starts.

07:03.173 --> 07:03.713
It starts.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.414
The day starts.

07:05.574 --> 07:07.255
Whether you want it to or not.

07:07.575 --> 07:09.236
It just does.

07:09.856 --> 07:15.719
But again today, I think a Ruffian has had another peron sighting!

07:15.779 --> 07:18.761
Hopefully it's not too scary.

07:18.821 --> 07:19.681
Let's see this time.

07:19.781 --> 07:22.903
October there was a lot of those, but... Not this time.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.564
What?

07:25.339 --> 07:27.620
De-den!

07:31.522 --> 07:35.844
There's a lot of powerful energy coming from this Pero Sighting.

07:37.585 --> 07:43.127
It's cool, but I'm somehow a bit frightened.

07:43.687 --> 07:52.551
You know Gunpla use a pretty small scale, but somehow it's really hard to tell just how big it is from this photo.

07:54.563 --> 07:58.027
I feel like it almost makes Pero look like, huge, nice.

07:58.207 --> 08:03.393
Did Pero feel a bit threatened and want to get a Gundam to use to intimidate others or something?

08:03.493 --> 08:04.814
Intimidation.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.596
That's his tactic.

08:07.177 --> 08:08.198
I mean, it makes sense.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.462
Pero can look pretty cute and harmless at first glance.

08:12.203 --> 08:14.325
So, I guess I can understand, but...

08:15.587 --> 08:18.010
This Gundam looks a bit different from the others.

08:18.030 --> 08:26.678
To tell the truth, Ruffians, we know very, very, very little about Gundam.

08:27.138 --> 08:31.643
We watch Suisei no Majou, you know, the Witch of Mercury, but even then,

08:33.510 --> 08:36.634
We had a little bit of a hard time following along.

08:37.075 --> 08:41.020
I don't know, I just didn't feel smart enough to understand sometimes.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.583
It was really good though, but I just didn't own it.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.138
I thought it was good, apparently it's not.

08:56.739 --> 08:59.963
I'm sorry.

09:00.243 --> 09:03.908
Hopefully Pero didn't cause too much mischief though, okay?

09:03.988 --> 09:07.952
BAU BAU!

09:08.293 --> 09:10.055
I like to build gunpla.

09:10.115 --> 09:11.196
Yeah, I like that.

09:11.336 --> 09:11.737
No more.

09:14.276 --> 09:15.578
Wow, Ruffians.

09:15.758 --> 09:20.763
I mentioned that today is the 101st day of FUWAMOCO.

09:20.964 --> 09:29.233
But in case you didn't know, yesterday was our 100th day together!

09:29.333 --> 09:30.394
BAU BAU!

09:30.454 --> 09:31.736
That makes today our

09:32.541 --> 09:35.343
Our 101st day as members of hololive!

09:46.710 --> 09:53.472
I wanted to mention again, you know, yesterday was our big celebration of 101 days since our debut.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.253
No, yesterday was our celebration of 100.

09:56.113 --> 09:56.333
100 days!

09:56.613 --> 09:58.154
100 days since debut!

09:58.194 --> 10:00.555
It was not just that.

10:00.935 --> 10:05.676
It was also 100 days continuously streaming every day!

10:05.876 --> 10:08.637
And those days being scheduled in advance, you know?

10:08.877 --> 10:09.838
Being on time, too.

10:10.618 --> 10:12.960
Perfect attendance.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.862
That can be tricky sometimes, you know?

10:17.683 --> 10:18.664
Ruffians!

10:19.104 --> 10:23.147
If you were a teacher, what grade would you give us?

10:23.807 --> 10:24.768
Teacher Ruffians.

10:25.008 --> 10:30.152
I'm reading!

10:32.193 --> 10:33.774
S+, is that good?

10:34.535 --> 10:34.655
A+, 100!

10:34.715 --> 10:35.015
Yeah!

10:39.477 --> 10:45.802
Well, you know, it was a really special 100 days filled with lots of memories.

10:46.002 --> 10:53.969
And we hope that it's a little bit of a snapshot into the rest of our days that are ahead of us for many years to come.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.050
Just a snapshot, right?

10:55.490 --> 11:01.955
But I guess now that it's been 100 days, you'd probably like to see what our room looks like too, huh?

11:03.937 --> 11:05.418
Not just the studio.

11:07.500 --> 11:07.840
Maybe.

11:09.363 --> 11:11.044
Well, we'll have to see!

11:11.384 --> 11:12.305
Who knows?

11:12.585 --> 11:19.989
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your love, your warmth, and support!

11:20.610 --> 11:21.690
Thank you!

11:21.770 --> 11:23.672
BAU BAU!

11:23.712 --> 11:25.533
Here's to many, many more days, okay?

11:25.593 --> 11:27.334
Yeah, many, many more days.

11:28.915 --> 11:30.316
Doing our celebration.

11:31.331 --> 11:33.934
It wasn't just chit-chat.

11:34.555 --> 11:39.341
We also brought a mirror out so that you could finally see what you really look like.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.684
Not just, like, rough scribbles from us.

11:47.225 --> 11:48.666
Wow.

11:48.846 --> 11:50.266
What do you think?

11:51.567 --> 11:52.247
What do you think?

11:52.587 --> 11:53.667
How do you look, Ruffians?

11:54.127 --> 11:57.288
Yeah, we have two different designs.

11:57.589 --> 11:59.289
Originally by each of us, you know.

11:59.549 --> 12:03.170
Moco-chan with the pink, the cool looking Ruffian.

12:03.370 --> 12:07.412
And mine, the silly and cute blue Ruffian.

12:09.092 --> 12:19.382
These are just the official looks though, so Ruffians, if you feel like you're neither or maybe a mix of both, please feel free to design and draw a Ruffian a bit more suitable for yourself, okay?

12:19.703 --> 12:24.067
This is just like the, maybe the majority of Ruffians official designs.

12:25.728 --> 12:32.791
Thank you so much to Oriente for the super cute finished designs and for making them come to life too.

12:33.572 --> 12:33.732
Right!

12:33.772 --> 12:34.492
Thank you!

12:34.532 --> 12:35.432
Thank you!

12:35.472 --> 12:36.153
Ruffians!

12:36.413 --> 12:39.554
Are you excited now that you know exactly what you look like?

12:42.335 --> 12:42.775
Pussies!

12:42.815 --> 12:43.876
You want pussies!

12:44.236 --> 12:45.557
Is a mohawk necessary?

12:46.397 --> 12:46.717
Yeah.

12:47.577 --> 12:50.219
I guess you could have a different hairstyle if you really wanted.

12:50.279 --> 12:50.819
Yeah!

12:51.199 --> 12:53.480
But I don't know, it makes you look cooler, no?

12:55.060 --> 12:55.561
Magnets!

12:56.161 --> 12:56.341
Mhmm.

13:09.517 --> 13:10.178
That'll be fun.

13:10.378 --> 13:14.341
Every time you walk by, you can look at it and like, touch the nose.

13:14.762 --> 13:15.983
We really like magnets.

13:16.283 --> 13:16.763
That's all.

13:17.244 --> 13:19.686
BAU BAU!

13:20.346 --> 13:22.088
Thank you!

13:22.128 --> 13:24.010
We look forward to seeing more of you Ruffians.

13:24.070 --> 13:24.910
I know.

13:27.533 --> 13:30.577
Yesterday was a very special day, right?

13:30.737 --> 13:33.360
But it wasn't just our special day.

13:33.740 --> 13:36.223
It was actually not even our special day.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.626
It was special, but it wasn't that special.

13:43.952 --> 13:50.535
Yesterday was actually hololive Indonesia's Zetta-senpai's birthday!

13:51.015 --> 13:53.276
Zetta-senpai, happy birthday!

13:53.696 --> 13:55.877
And, Ruffians, did you notice?

13:55.957 --> 14:00.478
We're actually guests on her birthday too!

14:00.779 --> 14:07.421
You know, Zetta-senpai asked us what we'd do if our birthday- If it was her birthday and we got stuck in a time loop.

14:07.821 --> 14:11.063
And what we would do if we woke up in her body.

14:13.035 --> 14:15.760
Just ignore Fuwawa's answer in particular for that doukei.

14:16.261 --> 14:23.976
Mai, I feel like if our birthday was stuck in a loop, we'd just be this type of people who celebrate their birthdays for the whole month.

14:25.532 --> 14:25.872
I don't know.

14:25.972 --> 14:26.933
I think it's just silly.

14:28.013 --> 14:32.076
You know, a birthday is special because it's that single special day.

14:32.616 --> 14:33.096
One day.

14:33.116 --> 14:33.557
You know what?

14:33.837 --> 14:38.799
If you celebrate for the whole month, that's just an excuse to spend one twelfth of the year partying, okay?

14:41.001 --> 14:42.942
It has to be that one special day.

14:43.642 --> 14:47.744
One day for Mococo and one day for Fuwawa, okay?

14:48.384 --> 14:49.184
Not a whole month.

14:51.145 --> 14:56.827
But you know, I think it's important to celebrate a special day when it's special.

14:56.847 --> 14:57.148
It is!

14:57.268 --> 14:59.048
We're very sentimental, you know that.

15:02.830 --> 15:06.451
I would like to see Zetta-senpai keep talking so chill.

15:07.312 --> 15:07.912
It's important.

15:07.932 --> 15:08.692
BAU BAU!

15:08.772 --> 15:11.373
Happy birthday, Zetta-senpai!

15:13.709 --> 15:14.369
Hi!

15:15.130 --> 15:20.031
Well, Ruffians, you remember what I said on Monday, right?

15:20.352 --> 15:21.252
What did you say on Monday?

15:21.292 --> 15:22.152
You say a lot of things.

15:22.752 --> 15:25.013
On Monday, did I say FUWAMOCO Morning right?

15:25.053 --> 15:26.634
We had no misunderstandings.

15:27.234 --> 15:27.474
Oh.

15:27.874 --> 15:28.334
Yeah.

15:29.355 --> 15:42.640
And, you know, Ruffians, I was a little bit concerned because I thought, you know, maybe, maybe, there's a little bit of a feeling that that might have been not correct.

15:44.198 --> 15:50.029
Yeah, we thought we were good, but... Ruffians, why didn't you say anything?

15:50.149 --> 15:50.890
Huh?

15:51.632 --> 15:52.213
Huh?

15:53.796 --> 15:54.717
You didn't say a thing.

15:54.737 --> 15:56.280
Yeah.

15:59.135 --> 16:05.258
Was it because you were trying to be nice?

16:07.779 --> 16:15.903
It seems, you know, Ruffians, that there was a misunderstanding left over from during Donkey Kong Country.

16:21.058 --> 16:30.204
Ruffians, do you remember being as shocked as I was when you heard Moco-chan give a sudden, intense compliment to Donkey Kong out of nowhere?

16:30.224 --> 16:30.764
I didn't!

16:31.705 --> 16:32.825
Yeah, I didn't.

16:33.846 --> 16:34.487
I was shocked.

16:35.247 --> 16:38.969
Yeah, but Moco-chan, what did you say, huh?

16:39.690 --> 16:41.271
It's a misunderstanding, okay?

16:41.371 --> 16:46.074
All I said was that... You're gonna make me repeat it.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.803
I said, Donkey Kong is really hot, huh?

16:51.843 --> 16:54.126
But I meant the game, okay?

16:54.866 --> 16:57.188
It was not a compliment to Donkey Kong.

16:57.469 --> 16:59.631
We get really hot while playing the game.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.234
And at the time, I thought all of you were being crazy.

17:03.254 --> 17:07.078
And I still think that, but when I listen to it over,

17:08.612 --> 17:09.932
I guess I could hear her.

17:10.573 --> 17:11.353
But Ruffians!

17:12.193 --> 17:15.874
First of all, why would you think that I would be a puppy that would say something like that?

17:15.934 --> 17:16.314
Hai.

17:16.834 --> 17:17.454
I'm Mococo.

17:17.474 --> 17:19.055
We spent a hundred days together.

17:19.075 --> 17:20.455
You should know me better than that.

17:20.555 --> 17:20.895
Hai.

17:21.555 --> 17:22.916
I'm not that kind of person.

17:23.816 --> 17:25.156
Maybe that's a Nerissa thing.

17:25.596 --> 17:26.797
Or maybe a Shiori thing.

17:27.257 --> 17:28.657
But it's not a Mococo thing!

17:29.818 --> 17:31.218
I obviously meant the game, okay?

17:32.318 --> 17:35.700
Donkey Kong is very hot because it makes us hot while playing it.

17:36.220 --> 17:36.980
Lots of screaming.

17:37.521 --> 17:38.301
Very scary.

17:38.661 --> 17:39.081
Falling.

17:39.462 --> 17:39.922
Screaming.

17:40.222 --> 17:41.463
Bananas.

17:42.223 --> 17:43.223
Understand, okay?

17:43.243 --> 17:44.064
Yeah.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.164
Got it.

17:45.705 --> 17:46.385
Not judging.

17:46.765 --> 17:47.626
Are you sure?

17:47.646 --> 17:50.887
You just threw Nerissa in the bus.

17:51.207 --> 17:51.728
I'm sure.

17:51.748 --> 17:53.729
I'm sure she likes Donkey Kong.

17:55.630 --> 17:55.990
Yeah.

17:56.590 --> 17:58.551
She likes Donkey Kong too, but not like that.

17:58.571 --> 17:59.371
Not like that.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.372
Not like Nerissa does.

18:02.110 --> 18:04.631
BAU BAU!

18:04.691 --> 18:05.271
BAU BAU!

18:05.411 --> 18:10.954
Understood now, right?

18:12.754 --> 18:15.396
BAU BAU!

18:15.436 --> 18:16.396
You understand now, right?

18:17.877 --> 18:19.097
Please don't misunderstand.

18:19.117 --> 18:21.598
Moco-chan wasn't giving any weird compliments.

18:21.878 --> 18:22.298
No!

18:22.799 --> 18:24.899
I was just saying that it's hot.

18:26.889 --> 18:27.870
Playing Donkey Kong.

18:28.270 --> 18:32.112
Ruffian!

18:32.132 --> 18:34.394
I had another dream.

18:34.994 --> 18:36.515
Two days in a row!

18:36.535 --> 18:39.237
And this one.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.669
It was really unexpected, but a happy dream.

18:44.689 --> 18:45.189
That's good.

18:45.509 --> 18:45.949
Yeah.

18:46.409 --> 18:52.770
I don't know, maybe it's because it's getting colder out now, and I feel really chilly in bed sometimes.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.391
I felt really chilly this morning too.

18:56.311 --> 18:58.071
But, you know what?

18:59.611 --> 19:05.533
Ruffians, I think because of that, that's why I had a dream where it was really snowy.

19:07.509 --> 19:08.249
Ruffians!

19:09.170 --> 19:13.733
I was going sledding, and you were all pulling the sled through the snow for me!

19:15.554 --> 19:21.457
And you know when I looked out, I could see all of you right in front, running like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU.

19:21.858 --> 19:23.979
And you were all glowing and shining!

19:24.119 --> 19:25.000
Glowing Ruffians.

19:25.580 --> 19:26.681
Yeah.

19:26.941 --> 19:28.702
I don't know where we are going though, but...

19:29.406 --> 19:34.208
I was just, I was really excited and I felt really warm too.

19:34.348 --> 19:39.210
But all I could see was in the front, like in front of me, so you Ruffians.

19:39.651 --> 19:42.192
And then a little bit to what was like the side.

19:42.252 --> 19:42.932
That makes sense.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.353
That's how vision works.

19:44.533 --> 19:45.273
Yeah, I guess.

19:45.373 --> 19:47.794
But it was just all white snow.

19:47.914 --> 19:50.376
Yeah, and we were going really, really fast.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.201
And I didn't know why.

19:53.961 --> 19:54.261
Why?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.202
Why so fast?

19:55.302 --> 19:55.682
Yeah.

19:55.782 --> 19:57.143
Because you're on a sled!

19:57.163 --> 20:02.225
And even though you know, like, well, sometimes you can go slow on the sled too, right?

20:02.886 --> 20:03.326
I don't know.

20:03.846 --> 20:04.206
I don't know.

20:04.267 --> 20:09.129
Even though we were going really fast, I didn't know where we were going, and it's cold and stuff too.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.530
I was really comfy.

20:11.853 --> 20:12.853
That's good.

20:13.353 --> 20:18.195
But I was a bit annoyed though, because for some reason you couldn't hear me.

20:18.215 --> 20:21.235
And so then we couldn't really talk that well together.

20:21.255 --> 20:22.656
No communication.

20:22.676 --> 20:22.716
No.

20:24.336 --> 20:30.177
And then... Ruffians, you're all pretty small dogs.

20:30.338 --> 20:31.958
Small dogs, but they're fast.

20:33.638 --> 20:37.699
There was a lot of Ruffians though, but you know, not the usual slight dogs.

20:37.759 --> 20:40.460
It was a little silly, like toy dogs.

20:41.050 --> 20:41.871
Toy dogs!

20:42.731 --> 20:48.575
But it was cute because I could see you all doing your best and working together as a team.

20:48.895 --> 20:50.797
I'm not a chihuahua!

20:50.857 --> 20:54.399
Not a chihuahua!

20:54.459 --> 20:55.420
But that was my dream!

20:56.220 --> 20:58.142
A bit strange, but a happy one.

20:58.622 --> 20:59.222
Makes sense.

20:59.523 --> 21:00.603
Toy Ruffians.

21:00.763 --> 21:07.208
I'm happy to share another dream with you Ruffians!

21:07.368 --> 21:09.790
I'm happy that it's better than my dreams recently!

21:11.307 --> 21:14.930
We are... We are... BAU BAU!

21:15.210 --> 21:16.971
BAU BAU!

21:17.272 --> 21:21.735
Ruffians, we saw you talking a bit about this yesterday.

21:21.755 --> 21:29.020
And, uh, so we thought that maybe we should share something, but I don't know, it's a little bit embarrassing.

21:29.100 --> 21:29.941
I don't know, it is.

21:30.021 --> 21:36.726
I don't know why, but... You know, I think it came up in the 100 day stream yesterday, right?

21:38.857 --> 21:48.322
But, Ruffians, when we were just tiny, tiny baby puppers, there was a show that we always watched with Mococo-B.

21:48.803 --> 21:52.925
And it was a show that was really special to her.

21:53.365 --> 21:59.789
It was her favorite... Star Trek!

22:00.429 --> 22:01.970
Yeah, you know...

22:02.731 --> 22:07.134
So, it was really special, so she shared it with us when we were still really little.

22:07.154 --> 22:12.097
We don't really remember much, but our favorite part was about the fluffy and fuzzy tribbles.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.958
Yeah, the tribbles everywhere.

22:14.978 --> 22:17.360
She even gave us a plushie of them as a present.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.741
Yeah, and a shake.

22:19.201 --> 22:20.122
I'm excited.

22:20.622 --> 22:24.564
Yeah, but we also did watch Star Wars a lot, too.

22:24.904 --> 22:27.666
Yeah, and that's what we liked the best there.

22:29.327 --> 22:33.370
Yeah, we like the Fluffy and the Fuzzy Ewoks the most.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.551
Do you understand, Ruffians?

22:35.971 --> 22:37.712
I wonder why, huh?

22:38.172 --> 22:43.896
Yeah, but Mama Puppy likes Star Trek better, and Papa Puppy likes Star Wars better.

22:44.736 --> 22:51.861
But I think maybe between the both of them, the Abyssgard household

22:53.376 --> 22:54.857
Probably a Star Trek household.

22:54.877 --> 22:55.518
Probably.

22:55.718 --> 22:56.519
Yeah.

22:56.779 --> 22:59.942
But no fights between Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy.

23:00.043 --> 23:01.264
They agree to disagree.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.346
Right.

23:03.826 --> 23:04.387
Yeah.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.490
I feel envy.

23:07.530 --> 23:09.111
Speaking of Yamato!

23:09.131 --> 23:10.613
No, this is Star Trek.

23:10.713 --> 23:12.655
This is Star Trek, this is Star Wars.

23:12.755 --> 23:13.996
Not Yamato, no!

23:14.056 --> 23:14.657
Not Yamato!

23:14.697 --> 23:15.698
No, it's good!

23:15.718 --> 23:17.359
I thought that too.

23:19.516 --> 23:21.777
There's a limit, okay?

23:22.717 --> 23:24.497
Imagine it's not the Yamato, okay?

23:25.817 --> 23:26.937
BAU BAU!

23:26.997 --> 23:28.618
BAU BAU!

23:29.338 --> 23:38.300
It's a little bit embarrassing, but... Yeah, that's a little bit of a view into the Abyssgard household.

23:38.320 --> 23:42.180
I guess... I thought... Maybe...

23:47.355 --> 23:49.436
Invite both some Ruffian spirits today.

23:50.856 --> 23:57.298
So... So... I wanted to say something!

23:57.318 --> 24:03.919
Good morning!

24:05.580 --> 24:06.180
You're awake!

24:07.520 --> 24:10.701
Your eyes are barely open, but you're awake!

24:11.894 --> 24:13.735
Good morning sleepyhead!

24:13.755 --> 24:16.237
You know, that's the thing.

24:16.537 --> 24:25.044
Even though your eyes aren't totally open, even though you're not totally awake, what matters is that you are up and you're here now.

24:27.345 --> 24:30.708
Sure, you might not be at your 100%, but that's okay!

24:31.108 --> 24:33.510
You can't give 100% to everything you do, okay?

24:34.711 --> 24:37.213
So for now, being only 50% awake is fine.

24:41.496 --> 24:46.318
The important thing is that task, wake up, it's done!

24:46.658 --> 24:49.178
Give yourself credit for that first step, okay?

24:50.039 --> 24:54.340
And from here out, all the next steps of your day is going to be even easier!

24:54.360 --> 25:03.103
If it's okay... Can I give you a tiny extra task for today?

25:03.143 --> 25:06.964
I think it would be nice, so...

25:09.266 --> 25:09.946
If it's okay.

25:10.606 --> 25:13.147
Extra task!

25:13.887 --> 25:14.107
Okay.

25:14.527 --> 25:21.269
As you go about your day today, can you try to find one thing, just one thing that stands out to you and makes you happy?

25:21.289 --> 25:23.810
It can be anything, okay?

25:25.290 --> 25:34.412
For example, I talked about it, but when we went on a walk the other day, I was happy to see the one plant growing straight through the concrete, as if nothing was in its way, right?

25:34.432 --> 25:37.333
Do something silly like that to remember the day by.

25:38.678 --> 25:39.199
You can do it!

25:39.299 --> 25:39.759
Okay!

25:39.779 --> 25:42.683
Be the plant that I saw yesterday!

25:42.703 --> 25:46.669
Let's make today a special one and be kind to ourselves.

25:47.230 --> 25:48.211
You can do it!

25:48.672 --> 25:50.855
You can get through to the weekend!

25:51.335 --> 25:52.357
Ganbatte ne!

25:52.857 --> 25:53.478
BAU BAU!

25:56.563 --> 25:59.364
BAU BAU!

25:59.464 --> 25:59.864
Got it!

26:00.504 --> 26:01.504
Got it, Ruffians!

26:01.564 --> 26:03.905
Moco-chan, you're giving homework now too?

26:05.085 --> 26:07.886
Homework for the Ruffians as we work on our homework, huh?

26:07.906 --> 26:08.506
Exactly!

26:08.526 --> 26:13.168
You know what I'm looking forward to today?

26:13.428 --> 26:13.648
What?

26:14.986 --> 26:19.150
Doggie of the Day!

26:19.471 --> 26:24.976
Today's Doggie of the Day is this old man, Dino!

26:25.076 --> 26:26.598
Dino's 13, you know?

26:26.678 --> 26:29.120
He doesn't look 13.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.722
He doesn't, right?

26:30.762 --> 26:34.566
He's very wise, but you know he isn't great or anything.

26:35.006 --> 26:39.449
Maybe... Is he going to get his fur dyed, maybe?

26:39.829 --> 26:40.590
That's okay.

26:40.730 --> 26:41.651
That's okay.

26:42.411 --> 26:42.952
No shame.

26:42.972 --> 26:48.516
Yeah, but you know... He just looks like he appreciates the world around him so much.

26:48.576 --> 26:48.996
He does!

26:49.776 --> 26:58.523
Yeah, you know... You know, all those walks you go on together... The ducks quacking and being annoying and squashing... I appreciate them too.

26:58.983 --> 27:01.585
All those things, yeah.

27:01.765 --> 27:03.886
It's a good way to view the world, you know?

27:05.742 --> 27:08.264
Well, how does dino BAU BAU?

27:08.284 --> 27:12.606
I feel like it's a surprisingly cute BAU BAU.

27:12.686 --> 27:12.986
Really?

27:13.026 --> 27:15.047
I feel like it's very quiet.

27:15.147 --> 27:16.168
Doesn't need to be loud.

27:16.208 --> 27:18.509
I feel like BAU BAU.

27:18.589 --> 27:19.810
BAU BAU.

27:19.850 --> 27:20.730
BAU BAU.

27:20.770 --> 27:21.611
BAU BAU.

27:21.851 --> 27:22.531
BAU BAU.

27:22.831 --> 27:25.793
It's a BAU BAU with a lot of wisdom behind it.

27:26.213 --> 27:27.394
Yeah, softness.

27:28.074 --> 27:29.315
Doesn't need attention.

27:29.355 --> 27:29.715
Yeah.

27:30.175 --> 27:30.735
Yeah.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.056
Very kind.

27:32.711 --> 27:36.333
Well, you know, Dino, yeah, Dino's very kind.

27:36.613 --> 27:40.154
Enjoys life and the world around him.

27:40.334 --> 27:44.936
Thirteen years of wisdom is what's behind all that fluff and fuzz.

27:45.337 --> 27:51.579
Yeah, and he's just happy to be by your side, and most importantly, part of your world, too.

27:51.859 --> 27:59.383
Yeah, no matter how old he is or how great he might get from here on, especially when the dye starts to run out.

28:01.039 --> 28:06.501
I'm happy to be loved by you so much and to be able to spend lots of time with you.

28:07.842 --> 28:10.623
BAU BAU!

28:10.643 --> 28:11.923
13 years is amazing.

28:11.943 --> 28:15.444
Lots of special memories.

28:16.505 --> 28:19.226
Well, Ruffians, you've been walking those paws.

28:20.386 --> 28:21.486
Where did you go this time?

28:21.907 --> 28:22.787
Let's see!

28:23.427 --> 28:24.347
De-den!

28:24.908 --> 28:25.528
Squirrel!

28:25.548 --> 28:27.269
Look at those ears!

28:27.289 --> 28:28.069
Oh my gosh.

28:29.609 --> 28:32.150
Ah, this is the best part of vlogs.

28:33.130 --> 28:36.690
You know, seeing things like squirrels and other cool things.

28:37.310 --> 28:38.211
Right, right.

28:38.231 --> 28:38.951
It's a good poodle.

28:39.031 --> 28:40.671
Right, it's a good poodle.

28:41.091 --> 28:43.051
It must have been really hard to get it too.

28:43.131 --> 28:43.692
And fast.

28:44.172 --> 28:45.752
Yeah, but his ears are so long.

28:45.812 --> 28:46.232
Right?

28:46.252 --> 28:47.712
That's what I noticed first.

28:47.772 --> 28:49.353
Longer than mine too.

28:49.373 --> 28:50.133
They stand right up.

28:52.053 --> 28:55.174
Well, I hope he can get really fat really soon.

28:55.214 --> 28:55.614
Yeah.

28:55.974 --> 28:57.014
She'll work on it.

28:59.216 --> 29:03.798
But you know, you're lucky that he's the type of squirrel to run away from you, though.

29:04.298 --> 29:05.619
To not run away?

29:05.999 --> 29:06.839
No, to run away.

29:06.939 --> 29:07.500
Oh, really?

29:07.880 --> 29:15.003
Yeah, because we seem to have the opposite problem of us having to run away from the squirrels because they always are pretty aggressive.

29:15.023 --> 29:17.224
Yeah, I don't know.

29:17.684 --> 29:22.146
Maybe they see our ears and our tails and something awakens in them.

29:22.286 --> 29:26.067
I don't know, but I just don't want to get shaken up by a squirrel for the snacks, okay?

29:26.107 --> 29:27.668
You don't have it.

29:28.385 --> 29:30.166
It's embarrassing running away from them.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.388
I try to keep my distance.

29:32.548 --> 29:33.468
I'm not distracted.

29:36.590 --> 29:40.293
Ruffians, make sure that you get really warm.

29:40.313 --> 29:42.514
Stay warm and cold when you go out, okay?

29:42.554 --> 29:43.235
Be safe, okay?

29:43.275 --> 29:45.776
You gotta be the fat squirrel too, okay?

29:46.897 --> 29:47.458
Bundle up.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.918
BAU BAU!

29:52.112 --> 29:55.015
Ruffians, we received another question!

29:55.256 --> 30:02.383
Today, our Question of the Day is... Hello FUWAMOCO!

30:02.543 --> 30:07.708
I wanted to thank you for making these last few months enjoyable to go through.

30:07.789 --> 30:08.790
Thank you!

30:09.210 --> 30:10.872
Thank you for being a wonderful...

30:11.432 --> 30:13.674
A wonderful part of our everyday, you know?

30:14.215 --> 30:16.577
Your streams are always the best part of my day.

30:17.077 --> 30:19.299
It always brightens my mood.

30:19.400 --> 30:19.900
Anyways!

30:20.921 --> 30:22.683
I have an important question to ask, right?

30:22.723 --> 30:23.323
The question.

30:24.224 --> 30:32.411
What's the color of your... Excuse me.

30:34.986 --> 30:35.907
Excuse me?

30:36.007 --> 30:38.568
What are you thinking?

30:38.948 --> 30:43.651
Just because it's been 100 days doesn't mean that you can ask those kinds of questions ever, okay?

30:43.671 --> 30:46.813
And you think that we'd actually answer it?

30:47.293 --> 30:48.254
You'd think that?

30:48.674 --> 30:51.636
We aren't the kind of dogs to do that and this is a morning show!

30:51.656 --> 30:53.157
It's a morning show!

30:53.737 --> 30:57.540
You know, we said maybe that we show you our room.

30:57.560 --> 31:03.826
But don't just think you can get away with asking stuff like this because maybe we're just a bit closer now, okay?

31:03.846 --> 31:05.007
Okay, Ruffians?

31:05.027 --> 31:06.508
You got it!

31:06.988 --> 31:11.672
Ruffians... So that's... That's what you really like, huh?

31:12.593 --> 31:13.974
That's what you think of us, huh?

31:18.118 --> 31:19.319
My opinion has changed.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.321
BAU BAU.

31:25.109 --> 31:28.751
Well, I guess we should let them know what's coming next, Moco-chan.

31:28.771 --> 31:29.312
Should we?

31:30.092 --> 31:31.033
Should we even?

31:31.053 --> 31:37.196
Oh, and I guess we're looking for more questions if there are... Not questions like that!

31:37.336 --> 31:38.917
Morning show questions, Ruffians!

31:38.937 --> 31:39.918
Morning show questions!

31:39.938 --> 31:41.238
This is a morning show!

31:41.258 --> 31:45.321
But Kiara-senpai asked... No!

31:45.401 --> 31:46.001
No!

31:46.021 --> 31:47.262
This is a morning show!

31:47.342 --> 31:49.403
It wasn't good then either.

31:51.905 --> 31:52.405
Ruffians.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.816
Sometimes you need to be softer.

31:56.276 --> 31:58.677
Well, I guess we're looking for more questions.

31:59.377 --> 32:02.239
And, uh... Pero Sightings and your dogs too.

32:02.579 --> 32:03.379
At least for now.

32:03.399 --> 32:07.201
This is a morning show, so that's the sort of things that we have on a morning show, you know?

32:07.221 --> 32:07.301
Yeah.

32:08.942 --> 32:12.123
I guess you could submit them with the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

32:12.163 --> 32:12.904
If you'd like to.

32:14.144 --> 32:16.845
If you think you can be up to the task.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.286
If you can handle that!

32:18.566 --> 32:19.026
Yeah.

32:20.267 --> 32:22.208
Well, Moco-chan, let's share what's next then.

32:25.632 --> 32:30.553
Our next stream coming up is... De-den!

32:31.593 --> 32:33.974
Well, this isn't today.

32:34.074 --> 32:38.514
Tonight we're gonna be taking the evening to focus on some of our homework.

32:38.994 --> 32:42.975
But we'll be back tomorrow for Fall Guys together with the Doggy Pack.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.495
That's okay, right, Moco-chan?

32:44.615 --> 32:45.716
Maybe that's okay.

32:45.736 --> 32:47.016
Together with the Doggy Pack.

32:47.756 --> 32:50.036
You know, it was so much fun last time, right?

32:50.056 --> 32:50.457
It was.

32:50.837 --> 32:51.477
You know?

32:51.597 --> 32:52.257
It was.

32:52.377 --> 32:52.817
Yeah, so...

32:53.197 --> 32:58.359
Ruffians, you know, if you weren't able to join, please grab Fall Guys, it's free!

32:58.779 --> 33:00.960
And then that way we can play all together!

33:01.080 --> 33:02.520
If you feel like it, I guess.

33:03.241 --> 33:10.083
It'd be a perfect time to grab the game and maybe if you're not part of the Doggy Pack yet, you could join and then, right?

33:10.103 --> 33:13.724
We can have some really chaotic and silly times all together tomorrow!

33:13.744 --> 33:17.346
Chaotic and silly in Fall Guys, not like the last question.

33:17.906 --> 33:18.046
Yeah.

33:18.066 --> 33:18.226
Yeah.

33:18.906 --> 33:22.110
We'll see you then, okay, Ruffians?

33:22.391 --> 33:23.011
Maybe.

33:23.812 --> 33:29.279
And we also have a recommendation, you know, since we're not gonna be live tonight.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.725
We recommend our most recent archive of our

33:34.005 --> 33:37.826
I keep talking and nobody explodes steam.

33:37.926 --> 33:46.287
I think, you know, what really stands out here is you can see just how well we worked together to smoothly defuse bombs, right?

33:46.447 --> 33:47.048
We did a good job.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.888
We almost didn't need to say anything, right?

33:48.928 --> 33:49.908
We did a good job.

33:49.948 --> 33:50.348
Right?

33:52.189 --> 33:52.429
Right?

33:53.009 --> 33:54.049
Exactly like that.

33:54.669 --> 33:55.349
No chaos.

33:55.989 --> 33:56.590
No yelling.

33:56.630 --> 33:57.230
No anger.

33:57.250 --> 33:57.830
Nothing.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.507
BAU BAU!

34:02.527 --> 34:02.967
Do the homework!

34:15.504 --> 34:18.146
Do the homework that we haven't been able to do.

34:18.426 --> 34:20.748
So that we can do some really cool things in the future too.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.511
Put Money-chan's tears back into the eye socket.

34:23.571 --> 34:23.831
Yeah.

34:24.091 --> 34:24.812
Right back.

34:24.852 --> 34:25.933
Right with these paws.

34:26.013 --> 34:26.233
Yeah.

34:26.613 --> 34:26.933
Yeah.

34:27.574 --> 34:28.114
So, but!

34:28.314 --> 34:30.116
You know we have some really exciting things.

34:30.156 --> 34:32.978
We have a watch-along with all of Advent.

34:33.359 --> 34:35.340
A rebroadcast of our Rawr Camp.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.342
We're finding it also short too!

34:37.422 --> 34:40.765
I would hope that the Ruffians are well behaved for the watch-along.

34:41.565 --> 34:42.126
I think so.

34:42.867 --> 34:43.247
Maybe.

34:43.487 --> 34:48.592
As long as you're not gonna ask Barbie any inappropriate questions either, huh?

34:48.753 --> 34:49.073
Right.

34:49.493 --> 34:49.734
Yeah.

34:51.866 --> 34:52.086
Yup.

34:52.886 --> 34:59.047
Well, Ruffians, thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:59.067 --> 35:06.049
Our 41st FUWAMOCO Morning on our 101st day in hololive.

35:06.809 --> 35:08.749
Thank you, Ruffians!

35:09.009 --> 35:09.549
Thank you.

35:09.789 --> 35:17.191
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

35:18.908 --> 35:19.729
Shiki.

35:19.929 --> 35:21.710

35:21.730 --> 35:23.832

35:24.052 --> 35:25.773
BAU BAU!

35:26.093 --> 35:27.274

Cruise.

35:52.009 --> 35:53.910

35:53.930 --> 35:59.672
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

36:00.312 --> 36:03.774
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:03.914 --> 36:07.475
BAU BAU!
