00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:58.714
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:04.944
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:08.629
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:12.395
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:16.542
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:21.468
And today we're your hosts at FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:22.029
We are.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.011
Yes, indeed.

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:29.598
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for our 153rd episode!

00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:33.082
Thank you FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:35.966
Does it not feel like we're just at our 135th episode?

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:39.871
We talked about how time goes.

00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:40.892
Yeah.

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:44.687
BAU BAU!

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:45.848
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:47.310
Bow to the BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:48.953
Hi!

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.395
What does that even mean?

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:52.437
I don't know.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.280
Ruffians are being silly, huh?

00:05:55.762 --> 00:06:03.453
Well, for Ruffians that are joining us, maybe for the first time, maybe you're just a little bit sleepy and forgot what is language.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:04.394
What are words?

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:10.322
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday,

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:15.630
Monday aka FUWAMOCO and it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:21.058
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.047
And to do so, sometimes it can be good to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:30.592
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:34.558
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.643
BAU BAU!

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.718
You know, it's a new week.

00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:43.803
It's gonna be a good new week, you know, Ruffians.

00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:45.104
Sometimes we feel like it.

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:47.227
Some days, yeah.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:48.068
Some days, no.

00:06:48.088 --> 00:06:49.791
That's okay.

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:51.713
I love you too, Abyss.

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:54.137
BAU BAU!

00:06:54.157 --> 00:06:54.317
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:56.560
Wow, a new week.

00:06:57.421 --> 00:06:58.503
There's a bunch of things.

00:06:58.663 --> 00:07:01.006
A bunch of exciting things maybe coming up.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.090
Except for some things.

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:07.495
I mean, don't say something right away, I get nervous.

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:21.643
Pero the...also...not a Pero, right?

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:26.289
It's a clinical list too, but... Huh?

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.170
But?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.530
But?

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:31.576
It's not.

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:32.196
BAU BAU!

00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:36.562
Who's Pero?

00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:41.669
Well... If we show where Pero was sighted, maybe they'll...figure it out, but... Let's check it out!

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.193
Where was Pero sighted this time?

00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:51.215
De-den!

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:57.166
Happy kodomo no hi!

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:57.426
To this day!

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:57.606
BAU BAU!

00:07:57.647 --> 00:07:58.468
It's pretty bright color.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.012
One thing doesn't quite match though, huh?

00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:09.106
That's the... You know Pero's drunk up there, you know, along with all of the lively fish kai.

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:10.168
You know.

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:12.529
Kodomo no hi.

00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:13.590
It's Children's Day.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.710
Five.

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.732
Five kodomo no hi Children's Day.

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:20.437
But on kodomo no hi, you put up a koi nobori just like this.

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:21.579
A fish plate.

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:22.119
I know.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:27.345
To be able to kind of wish that my children get strong and healthy and successful.

00:08:27.365 --> 00:08:28.806
Like, oh, the koi.

00:08:29.407 --> 00:08:29.587
Yeah.

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:30.108
Right.

00:08:30.128 --> 00:08:31.389
Pero is a koi fish now.

00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:32.971
That's why they're up there.

00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:33.371
I don't know.

00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:34.312
He did that himself.

00:08:34.332 --> 00:08:35.954
I don't think so.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:36.514
I don't know.

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.858
His tongue sure is flopping in the window, huh?

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:40.999
Yeah.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:51.827
You know, I don't think that Pero will quite bring strength and happiness and health and success.

00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:55.697
I don't know either, but... A nasty koi flag!

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.714
I feel like you catch a lot of air.

00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:02.436
Probably a lot of bugs.

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:04.798
Probably, but... I don't know.

00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:06.380
I like to think you know.

00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:10.104
There's a Ruffian that had a little Ruffian.

00:09:10.124 --> 00:09:13.648
And they wanted to celebrate Korou no Hi this way.

00:09:13.668 --> 00:09:13.768
Yeah.

00:09:14.108 --> 00:09:14.349
Right.

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:17.612
Oh, you think Pero could break a string because he's all muscle?

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:24.840
Well, just because you have muscle doesn't mean that you're strong.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:26.601
Really, Moco-chan?

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:27.242
It's the truth.

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.771
True strength comes from multiple places, you know?

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:32.632
Like the heart?

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:33.273
Yeah.

00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:35.778
Yeah.

00:09:35.798 --> 00:09:38.323
Well, I'm glad Pero's up there and not us.

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:42.115
Yeah.

00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:43.536
Pussy though, I don't know.

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:44.517
The Koi!

00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:44.977
The Koi!

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.399
They're the best up there.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.580
Yeah.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.041
Then they can swim!

00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.083
BAU BAU!

00:09:51.303 --> 00:09:52.464
Happy Children's Day!

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:55.948
Golden Week.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:59.851
In case you didn't know, Children's Day is a part of Golden Week.

00:10:00.252 --> 00:10:05.016
Which is a string of holidays in Japan that line up for a week.

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:06.497
But not this year.

00:10:06.517 --> 00:10:07.078
It's kind of funny.

00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:10.504
But, but, but, but!

00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:12.268
Ruffians, we have some happy news!

00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:22.711
Our very first song cover, Ayo Asobi's Kaibutsu, has now over 7 million views on YouTube!

00:10:22.731 --> 00:10:24.275
7 million!

00:10:24.295 --> 00:10:25.658
That's wow!

00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:33.041
Thank you Ruffians!

00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.542
Thank you!

00:10:33.562 --> 00:10:33.903
Congratulations!

00:10:34.263 --> 00:10:39.292
Bakaibutsu, you know all our cover songs, all our songs really mean a lot to us.

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:41.015
Bakaibutsu especially so.

00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:48.849
Not just because it was released right after we debuted, but also because of the meaning, the lyrics behind the song.

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:53.097
Ruffians, did you know?

00:10:53.633 --> 00:11:02.758
Actually, when Kaibutsu originally premiered, it had English lyrics on the bottom translated by us.

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:04.302
Did you know?

00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:09.884
But for certain reasons, you know, they had to be removed forever.

00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:11.145
That's okay though.

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.887
It happens!

00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:15.791
You saw, you remember them, but they're not there anymore.

00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.236
In fact, we didn't even know they were there at one point.

00:11:20.256 --> 00:11:22.959
So I'm happy that they were there at a moment.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:32.711
But more than anything, we're just really happy that we're able to sing this very special song and share our performance of it with you.

00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:34.693
That's all.

00:11:34.673 --> 00:11:36.656
I'm sure you didn't know about it.

00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:41.823
I'm sure there's, you know, Ruffians watching right now which have not listened to Kaibutsu.

00:11:42.063 --> 00:11:42.804
And you know what that means?

00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:48.091
It's a good chance to go listen to Kaibutsu!

00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:54.280
But you know, FUWAMOCO, we really want to continue to sing lots and lots and lots for you.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.786
So it'd make us happy if you could maybe listen to our music here.

00:11:58.846 --> 00:12:01.930
Singing is important to us.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:08.099
You know, and that way we can share our feelings with you that way too, so.

00:12:12.245 --> 00:12:12.405
BAU BAU!

00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:13.366
Thank you!

00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:13.587
Thank you!

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:13.767
BAU BAU!

00:12:13.787 --> 00:12:13.947
BAU BAU!

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:18.874
But, uh, speaking of singing... Oh?

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:25.824
Well... A certain demon of sound... Yeah!

00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:27.486
Nerissa Weaver!

00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:27.747
Nerissa!

00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:29.810
She released a brand new cover song!

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.512
Together with...

00:12:31.863 --> 00:12:33.605
Elizabeth!

00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:36.028
FUWAMOCO!

00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:38.370
We're in our first duet together.

00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:41.634
Of a song that we very much love.

00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:46.339
It's an anime song from the anime Revolutionary Girl Utena.

00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:48.301
And we knew about it before.

00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.603
I love singing this song.

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:52.106
It's my go-to karaoke song too.

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:59.033
So when Nerissa said, FUWAMOCO, I'm gonna be covering this with Elizabeth, I'm like... Oh yes!

00:12:59.054 --> 00:12:59.734
Finally!

00:12:59.955 --> 00:13:00.876
Yes!

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:01.036
Good!

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:01.296
Good!

00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:06.406
If you haven't heard of Utena before, you could say it's a magical girl.

00:13:06.426 --> 00:13:09.292
It's definitely a magical girl anime, but maybe not a magical girl anime.

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:10.835
You're thinking out.

00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:15.484
It combines... What kind of genre is it?

00:13:15.684 --> 00:13:16.747
I don't even know.

00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:18.570
What would you call that genre?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.454
Rock, opera, drama.

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:21.336
Love.

00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:22.558
Magical girl.

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:29.598
It's amazing.

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:33.184
It transcends genre, yes!

00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:36.309
I don't know, but I think there's another song that I like better.

00:13:36.329 --> 00:13:36.930
Yeah.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:46.825
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:13:47.547 --> 00:14:13.015
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:14.076
Beautiful.

00:14:14.096 --> 00:14:14.817
Magnificent.

00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:19.203
Now I'm starting to think, if we were magical girls together with Nerissa... Yeah?

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:21.066
What would we be?

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:27.034
I sort of feel like Advent would be like... Doremi.

00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:28.456
Not Madoka?

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.740
Madoka.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.102
That's an easy answer though.

00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:36.046
Who loses their head?

00:14:36.066 --> 00:14:37.668
Shiori.

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:41.073
Oh my goodness, I thought it was me for sure.

00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:42.495
I don't know, Shiori is horrible.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:45.228
It's Fuwawa.

00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:47.731
It's Fuwawa.

00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:48.712
Can I make it Nerissa at least?

00:14:48.732 --> 00:14:48.812
Huh?

00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:50.514
Nerissa's a candidate for that, no?

00:14:51.536 --> 00:14:53.458
She loses her head every other day anyway.

00:14:55.721 --> 00:14:56.702
Okay, it's Nerissa.

00:14:56.722 --> 00:14:56.982
It's Nerissa.

00:14:57.002 --> 00:14:57.943
Yes!

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.947
Okay, I get the... You convinced me it's Nerissa.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:01.848
Yes.

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:06.293
Okay, but we're gonna avoid spoilers even though it's been how many... It's been over a decade.

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:07.775
So, yes.

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:09.377
Okay.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.255
BAU BAU!

00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:17.159
Please check out more inside Elizabeth's cover!

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:17.380
BAU BAU!

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.641
Let me show Nerissa who's this red.

00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.107
BAU BAU!

00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:27.573
Well, as we mentioned right now, it's Golden Week, a stream of holidays in Japan.

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:31.779
So there's a bunch of cool events going on for a little bit of a limited time.

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.742
A little bit.

00:15:33.762 --> 00:15:36.946
There's a bunch of fun events going on for a limited time.

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:40.090
And one of them that's very exciting to us is there is a

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:46.886
hololive figure exhibition going on right now in Akihabara!

00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:49.733
Together with Good Smell Company and Ami Ami.

00:15:49.753 --> 00:15:50.996
They're putting it on.

00:15:51.457 --> 00:15:56.830
But if you go over to the famous Akihabara Radio Kaikan building.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.037
You know the one in Spine's Cave.

00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:06.186
If you go there, up to the 10th floor, you can go see a bunch of hololive figures.

00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:08.110
Only hololive figures!

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:14.701
The ones from Kotobukiya, Design Coco, Max Fudgey, Furyu, Kleenex, Bandai, Animus, etc.

00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:15.663
etc.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:22.294
So many figure theaters that we love too!

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:41.143
Ina-senpai has been doing a big, big job recently, so you can see her there too, but you can also

00:16:41.714 --> 00:16:42.976
FUWAMOCOdechu.

00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:45.179
Yeah!

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.523
I found the printer on display there!

00:16:47.543 --> 00:16:52.872
Also on Android, and I believe as well the app is designed for FUWAMOCO.

00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:53.052
Yeah!

00:16:53.072 --> 00:16:54.775
So you can go and check them out.

00:16:54.795 --> 00:17:01.465
If maybe you didn't get a very good look at Expo, or you weren't able to head to Expo, you can go check them out there.

00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:02.567
Admission?

00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:04.490
No admission!

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.831
It's free!

00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:07.054
It's free for when you'd like to.

00:17:07.795 --> 00:17:09.578
Except today's the last day, so...

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:12.902
You have until the 6th.

00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:14.205
The end of today.

00:17:15.688 --> 00:17:18.773
But that means you still have a good chunk of hours to go.

00:17:18.834 --> 00:17:19.415
Many hours.

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:27.931
But here you can also get cute little acrylic stands on Android Designs.

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:30.095
And free stickers!

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:33.000
Free stickers too!

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:35.623
But!

00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:37.468
The stickers are great!

00:17:37.488 --> 00:17:38.872
They're very cute and all!

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:39.173
They're shiny!

00:17:39.273 --> 00:17:41.800
Yeah, they have a little bit of a cute shine to them.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.952
I was surprised because so many Ruffians were taking photos and I was like, they're so cute!

00:17:46.574 --> 00:17:47.075
Right!

00:17:47.476 --> 00:17:49.943
And they couldn't tell it was two!

00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:53.978
We just gotta send this one more FUWAMOCO, right?

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.767
I want more, please!

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.294
We just can't go and get our own paws on them, right?

00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.659
Past the figure exhibition.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:07.364
Excuse me, give me my stickers please!

00:18:07.384 --> 00:18:08.286
Thank you!

00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:27.540
If you happen to be in Akihabara, maybe you could swing by the Radio Kaikan.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.966
You know, FUWAMOCO, we love going to these events, you know?

00:18:31.287 --> 00:18:34.873
There's so many different events and exhibitions going on in Akihabara.

00:18:34.893 --> 00:18:42.547
Yeah, and especially if you know, you have a bit of time, you don't really have any plans, just going to some of these free events, just looking at things is so inspiring.

00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:43.469
It's so fun, you know?

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.433
Oh, this illustrator's doing an exhibition.

00:18:45.493 --> 00:18:47.056
I've never heard of them, but that looks cute.

00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:48.298
Oh, I'll go check it out.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:48.819
Oh, okay.

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:50.001
Oh, maybe I'll get an acrylic face.

00:18:49.981 --> 00:19:18.537
BAU BAU!

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:19.879
I'm just so happy.

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:21.481
That was so much fun.

00:19:21.741 --> 00:19:24.404
And lots of fun.

00:19:24.424 --> 00:19:28.069
We recently had a bunch of fun.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.931
A little bit of spooky fun.

00:19:30.812 --> 00:19:37.881
Because FUWAMOCO, we had a mini horror game matsuri recently.

00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:41.385
Somehow we ended up playing horror games.

00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:44.929
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:48.374
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:51.660
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:20:07.305
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:38.001
To be honest, I'm surprised that I have not seen any clips from it yet.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:38.998
Hi.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.120
I think there's a lot of Ruffians.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:42.941
Maybe.

00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:47.726
It should be maybe change from broken boy to mind broken.

00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:49.888
Yeah.

00:20:49.908 --> 00:20:50.428
It was a masterpiece.

00:20:50.448 --> 00:20:52.430
If you have not seen it, it's not that long.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:53.751
Yeah.

00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:55.853
We went in, you know, excited.

00:20:55.893 --> 00:20:59.056
Gonna go on a Japan trip to the next country side.

00:20:59.076 --> 00:20:59.877
Oh, what's wrong?

00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:01.318
That was beautiful.

00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:02.759
Everything was wrong.

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:05.642
The game, it was beautiful.

00:21:05.943 --> 00:21:08.094
But that was very interesting!

00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:11.110
You never know what's gonna happen once a year!

00:21:12.153 --> 00:21:12.774
Recommend.

00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:15.297
We recommended it to all of our... Don't tell them.

00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:16.138
Don't tell them.

00:21:16.158 --> 00:21:16.738
Yes.

00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:17.239
Yeah.

00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.702
So, if you haven't seen it, watch it.

00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:21.424
Yeah.

00:21:21.444 --> 00:21:25.168
And after that, we're trying to move on.

00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:28.351
Wrap ourselves around reality again.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:32.456
You know, we decided to play another game called Debug Deadline.

00:21:33.497 --> 00:21:33.757
Which is fun!

00:21:33.778 --> 00:21:34.538
It was really fun.

00:21:34.558 --> 00:21:40.065
We became really good debuggers at the game company, Doki Doki Games.

00:21:40.305 --> 00:21:40.405
Yeah.

00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:52.318
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:52.568 --> 00:21:56.512
It was a really fun game.

00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:57.512
Aren't you a personal favorite?

00:21:57.893 --> 00:21:58.673
Lots of silly things.

00:21:58.694 --> 00:21:59.895
There was para para.

00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:00.735
Para dan.

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:03.678
A lot of different references to things.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.501
Was it even scary?

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.323
At the very beginning.

00:22:09.343 --> 00:22:10.644
It was scary at the beginning.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:12.426
The first time you see the bug, yeah.

00:22:12.926 --> 00:22:15.529
And then you see it again and again and again and again.

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:17.811
Okay, dodge the skeleton.

00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:19.392
It like breaks.

00:22:19.412 --> 00:22:20.213
I'm scared here.

00:22:20.293 --> 00:22:22.355
Okay, okay, okay.

00:22:22.455 --> 00:22:22.575
Dodge.

00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:28.242
I said five games, we played six games, no?

00:22:29.944 --> 00:22:34.269
And then we played Witch's Creek, but it was really intense and scary, so that didn't last for long.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:39.256
And then we went on to our final game, Tsugu no Hii!

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:40.497
The new one!

00:22:40.537 --> 00:22:45.664
We learned about the terrifying horror behind phantom characters.

00:22:45.684 --> 00:22:46.825
Kanji.

00:22:47.598 --> 00:22:51.224
So then we had a bit of a kanji lesson together with the Ruffians!

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:52.265
Yeah!

00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:53.808
And that was my horror game!

00:22:53.828 --> 00:22:55.130
Let's do it again!

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.392
It was a bunch of fun!

00:22:56.412 --> 00:23:02.521
So, maybe if you're feeling, oh maybe let's just have a little bit of a small spooky break, you can join us for one of those.

00:23:02.842 --> 00:23:03.663
Broken lore?

00:23:04.004 --> 00:23:04.965
No recommend.

00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:09.182
I was almost crying.

00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:10.203
We were crying.

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.464
I was stomping my feet.

00:23:13.146 --> 00:23:15.810
You had a nightmare from Tsugunohi.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.354
I was so tired I just fell asleep actually.

00:23:19.374 --> 00:23:23.579
I didn't even make it to Moco-chan's bed.

00:23:23.599 --> 00:23:24.761
I didn't even get an eye mask on.

00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:26.943
I don't even think I plugged in my phone.

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.646
You did it Moco-chan!

00:23:29.386 --> 00:23:31.169
I just zonked this goo.

00:23:33.151 --> 00:23:34.733
No time for nightmares.

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.438
No time, just sleep.

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:45.481
But it was a lot of fun, so we hope that we can have more special events like that together with you in the future, Ruffians.

00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:50.815
In Tsugunohi's defense, the next night when I woke up in the middle of the night, I was scared.

00:23:52.077 --> 00:23:56.386
Yeah, it didn't stop.

00:23:56.406 --> 00:23:56.567
BAU BAU!

00:23:57.449 --> 00:24:02.380
And Ruffians deshita, you've probably heard something's going on right now.

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:03.121
But!

00:24:03.622 --> 00:24:05.466
hololive English!

00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:09.495
We've just started a brand new part of our

00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:16.365
Minecraft Roleplaying Event Enigmatic Wrinkle in 2!

00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:17.987
Yes, it's the new chapter of Tales of Fate!

00:24:18.368 --> 00:24:23.755
Although if you weren't able to join us for Chapter 1 back in September last year, don't worry!

00:24:23.775 --> 00:24:26.439
You can join us right from the beginning here.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.721
Right, Moco-chan?

00:24:28.262 --> 00:24:28.362
What?

00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:32.829
Ruffians, do you want a summary of what happened?

00:24:33.209 --> 00:24:34.952
Do you want to hear the summary from Fuwawa?

00:24:35.252 --> 00:24:36.154
Off the top of her head?

00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:39.959
A summary of N-Reco 1 and the lore of N-Reco 2?

00:24:42.123 --> 00:24:42.663
Disclaimer!

00:24:42.683 --> 00:24:45.488
It may not be entirely accurate.

00:24:45.568 --> 00:24:49.434
ENigmatic Recollection Chapter 2 Chains of Fate.

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:54.641
We are now in the ancient Labesto.

00:24:54.762 --> 00:24:55.783
Labesto is

00:24:55.763 --> 00:24:57.065
The place that we were last time.

00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:57.645
Yes!

00:24:57.745 --> 00:25:09.480
But, uh, well there was the Lobesto King, and we were trying to do stuff, get memories back, and then we found out he wasn't so much nice like a king, he was more bad, being controlled by the stains.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.321
And the enemies!

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.324
And then he became a king stain!

00:25:12.624 --> 00:25:13.365
And we took him down!

00:25:13.605 --> 00:25:13.906
Corruption!

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:18.331
But then, that wasn't actually Lobesto, it was just a, a big Lobesto!

00:25:18.712 --> 00:25:21.535
And then, he became the outsider.

00:25:21.515 --> 00:25:26.305
And then, so now, we are now in a different place.

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.489
And, but, we found a cute rat?

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:28.970
Cat?

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.391
Cute.

00:25:29.411 --> 00:25:30.714
A cute, called Fia!

00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:32.418
And Fia's lost some of her memories.

00:25:32.438 --> 00:25:33.259
She's part of the library.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:33.961
She's a library.

00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:35.364
Cute.

00:25:35.384 --> 00:25:37.668
And, now, we're trying to help.

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.392
But the library is invisible.

00:25:39.432 --> 00:25:40.975
The library's, oh, is that important?

00:25:41.035 --> 00:25:41.496
Moco-chan, really?

00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:42.358
I think so.

00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:42.679
But!

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.551
Now also in Ancient Labesto, we're trying to help Fia find her cute memories.

00:25:48.032 --> 00:25:51.962
And there's a king-queen-queen-princess, Ephania.

00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:52.985
She's pretty nice.

00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:54.228
But there's a prophecy.

00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:58.980
And that we only have seven days until the Ancient Labesto is over.

00:25:59.298 --> 00:26:00.940
And we're trying to find the outsider.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.581
I said that, right?

00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:02.902
But there's also the outsider.

00:26:02.983 --> 00:26:03.283
Yes!

00:26:03.483 --> 00:26:07.869
Who is the same king who was the Abyssal King.

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:08.209
Yes.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.133
And now we've also heard about this outsider.

00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:12.494
This outsider's... No, no, no.

00:26:12.615 --> 00:26:13.335
Outlander.

00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:14.977
There's an outlander and... No.

00:26:15.378 --> 00:26:15.818
Outlander!

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:16.299
You're right!

00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:17.280
There's an outsider bad.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.201
Outlander good.

00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:21.305
That's where we're at.

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:22.707
And the outlander is...

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.142
A swordsman, mysterious swordsman.

00:26:25.242 --> 00:26:26.504
Good.

00:26:26.524 --> 00:26:28.005
And we are the shining stars.

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.387
Shining stars, that's me.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.149
And we're gonna save things.

00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:33.552
Yes.

00:26:33.572 --> 00:26:36.735
Does it sound correct?

00:26:36.755 --> 00:26:38.898
That is an record in a nutshell.

00:26:39.338 --> 00:26:40.099
A full nutshell.

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:41.581
And it is roleplay.

00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:42.782
Yes.

00:26:42.802 --> 00:26:46.346
You know, like I mentioned, it's Minecraft roleplay.

00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:50.951
That sounds correct.

00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:51.052
Yes.

00:26:51.072 --> 00:26:51.172
Yeah.

00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:51.392
Nailed it!

00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:51.512
Yeah!

00:26:51.492 --> 00:27:01.343
But you know, to be able to start all this celebration off, there was a very silly 3D program that introduced a new chapter.

00:27:01.444 --> 00:27:02.725
And introduced balloons.

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:03.706
Balloons.

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:07.470
There was Calli-senpai, Korone-senpai, Biboo and Nerissa.

00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:10.934
We played some games while sharing info and record.

00:27:11.695 --> 00:27:13.738
And there was a big scary balloon pop.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.562
Oh no, I just got an idea.

00:27:17.582 --> 00:27:18.383
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:27:18.844 --> 00:27:20.065
More balloons!

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.442
Are you thinking about putting... Oh.

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:29.614
What if... I hide the balloons.

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:36.286
Oh, and then... Go to the time and... Pick up the balloons.

00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:36.366
Oh!

00:27:38.118 --> 00:27:44.147
I was thinking about, you know how, I remember having our second anniversary coming up.

00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:50.495
Why don't we have like a balloon popping race where we break into teams and we have to pop them?

00:27:50.515 --> 00:27:51.156
You have to sit on the balloons!

00:27:51.176 --> 00:27:51.397
No, no, no!

00:27:51.417 --> 00:27:52.518
No sitting on the balloons!

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:53.360
You have to use teamwork, Moco-chan!

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.082
You have to pop them together!

00:27:55.282 --> 00:28:00.109
I was thinking a race where we pop the balloons with our bottoms.

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:05.357
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:05.738 --> 00:28:09.844
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:15.773
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:16.114 --> 00:28:24.747
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:24.727 --> 00:28:26.550
Would you like to see that, Ruffians?

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:32.160
You better see how scared that both Biboo and Calli-senpai got about this massive balloon.

00:28:33.523 --> 00:28:33.803
But.

00:28:34.304 --> 00:28:35.827
Yes, yes, you would like to see that.

00:28:36.187 --> 00:28:40.575
You would like to see Biboo and I run into each other and pop a balloon with our bodies.

00:28:41.652 --> 00:28:42.793
Wow, Ruffians.

00:28:42.934 --> 00:28:46.358
That sounds fun.

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:50.463
But not just fun and record fun going on.

00:28:50.483 --> 00:28:56.451
There's also a brand new theme song for this new chapter called Monster.

00:28:56.471 --> 00:28:58.073
It's such a cool song.

00:28:58.093 --> 00:28:59.775
So jazzy.

00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:06.664
And this time we have Ina-senpai, Connie-senpai, Shiori and Gigi singing it.

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.326
I can't remember if I remember it right now.

00:29:08.607 --> 00:29:12.872
I'm gonna hum something and then tell me if I'm right.

00:29:13.553 --> 00:29:20.081
Okay, I wasn't certain.

00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:22.064
I thought maybe it was some other song.

00:29:22.084 --> 00:29:24.547
No, it's just really jazzy, really good.

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:29.293
It kind of has a bit of the Cowboy Bebop feel to it actually, right?

00:29:29.273 --> 00:29:32.578
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:48.480
Have a howl of a day!

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.903
It gets me so hyped up.

00:29:50.644 --> 00:29:50.844
Why?

00:29:51.626 --> 00:29:57.696
But we hope that you'll join all of us as we continue our journey in MRECORD!

00:29:57.716 --> 00:30:02.304
Who knows what will happen!

00:30:03.647 --> 00:30:04.188
BAU BAU!

00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:05.089
BAU BAU!

00:30:05.109 --> 00:30:05.430
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.114
I think it's time for the Doggie of the Day.

00:30:08.255 --> 00:30:09.196
The Doggie of the Day!

00:30:09.918 --> 00:30:13.624
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:30:14.414 --> 00:30:19.460
It's Jackson!

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.821
FUWAMOCO!

00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:23.745
That's a wild little punk!

00:30:23.765 --> 00:30:24.707
He's so cute!

00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:28.611
But, uh, does he look like a grandpa of the house to you, Moco-chan?

00:30:28.912 --> 00:30:30.453
No, he looks like a baby.

00:30:30.474 --> 00:30:31.174
Right, right!

00:30:31.194 --> 00:30:31.875
Baby grandpa!

00:30:32.576 --> 00:30:33.377
Baby grandpa!

00:30:33.397 --> 00:30:34.518
That's his name, Baby Grandpa!

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:36.200
Baby Grandpa Jackson!

00:30:36.241 --> 00:30:37.682
Baby Grandpa Jackson!

00:30:39.064 --> 00:30:39.925
But look!

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:43.329
The curls!

00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:44.050
The color is so cute!

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.654
I want to poke that nose.

00:30:46.774 --> 00:30:48.377
No, no, I want to pull out the tongue.

00:30:48.958 --> 00:30:50.180
Pull out the tongue?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.722
I want to pinch it.

00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:53.165
I was going to say I want to poke it.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.448
I want to poke it and pull it.

00:30:55.468 --> 00:30:56.690
Poke and pull it.

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:00.236
That's very cute.

00:31:00.256 --> 00:31:02.539
Moco-chan, how does Jackson BAU BAU?

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.386
Well, definitely not like a grandpa, I don't think.

00:31:07.427 --> 00:31:10.512
Maybe more like... BAU BAU.

00:31:10.672 --> 00:31:11.073
BAU BAU.

00:31:11.093 --> 00:31:11.674
BAU BAU.

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:25.435
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:25.736 --> 00:31:39.754
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:31:40.139 --> 00:32:01.000
BAU BAU!

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:12.001
Today I went on a walk.

00:32:14.846 --> 00:32:17.571
What is this?

00:32:18.327 --> 00:32:21.312
The strongest walk to a gym!

00:32:21.512 --> 00:32:22.995
Good on you!

00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:25.699
Getting up to the gym!

00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:30.807
I'm really happy that we can help you with your gym journey!

00:32:31.188 --> 00:32:32.149
Do your best!

00:32:32.209 --> 00:32:34.633
But make sure you stretch a lot, you know?

00:32:34.693 --> 00:32:35.575
It's a giant donut.

00:32:36.657 --> 00:32:38.960
I don't think you want to try biting that one.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.443
I don't think it's very soft.

00:32:40.463 --> 00:32:43.187
Then we'll go from the gym to the dentist, maybe.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.522
Lots of appointments.

00:32:45.543 --> 00:32:46.223
Make sure you stretch.

00:32:46.384 --> 00:32:47.345
No biting this!

00:32:48.587 --> 00:32:48.707
No!

00:32:48.747 --> 00:32:49.728
Only do the injuries.

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:52.311
But form is important.

00:32:52.412 --> 00:32:55.135
And sleep too!

00:32:56.517 --> 00:32:58.400
I say you know, right?

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.281
We're not your coach.

00:33:01.524 --> 00:33:02.385
We're demon dogs.

00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:07.552
BAU BAU!

00:33:07.572 --> 00:33:07.872
Good luck!

00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:09.394
See you guys!

00:33:09.695 --> 00:33:11.017
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:13.341
And for the Question of the Day!

00:33:13.361 --> 00:33:16.767
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:33:17.148 --> 00:33:21.475
When you travel, do you usually listen to music or catch up on sleep?

00:33:21.615 --> 00:33:24.620
Were there any hololive songs you listened to during your trip?

00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:27.545
I kinda slept a little bit, but really more than anything.

00:33:27.586 --> 00:33:31.973
Okay, this is the time that I can listen to music!

00:33:31.953 --> 00:33:34.436
Mococo.

00:33:34.477 --> 00:33:51.160
Yes.

00:33:51.764 --> 00:33:54.248
New demo, huh?

00:33:54.268 --> 00:33:58.895
You know, we're learning for any kind of reason.

00:33:59.456 --> 00:34:00.177
Yeah, you know.

00:34:00.378 --> 00:34:02.501
Breaking dimensions.

00:34:02.521 --> 00:34:03.663
Yeah, breaking dimensions.

00:34:03.743 --> 00:34:06.447
Odyssey was one of those.

00:34:06.467 --> 00:34:08.350
Yeah, but you know.

00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:16.924
So, yeah, we listen to a bunch of hololive songs and also hololive songs that have reached our ears too.

00:34:16.944 --> 00:34:17.485
Yeah.

00:34:17.465 --> 00:34:20.069
Yeah, hardcore unreleased long demos.

00:34:20.209 --> 00:34:21.230
Why?

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.476
Did you hear Mon-chan beforehand?

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:25.656
No!

00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:26.297
No!

00:34:26.317 --> 00:34:27.338
Because we're not a part of it.

00:34:27.439 --> 00:34:29.862
Yeah, but we... We heard it the same time.

00:34:30.362 --> 00:34:31.444
Almost the same time.

00:34:31.724 --> 00:34:33.146
We heard it start again though.

00:34:33.166 --> 00:34:34.228
Huh?

00:34:34.628 --> 00:34:34.808
Right?

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:35.650
Yeah.

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:43.320
Yeah, so... I'm always very happy when demos get shared.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:35:02.912
BAU BAU!

00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:05.711
Thank you so much!

00:35:05.771 --> 00:35:07.794
Thank you for all your submissions.

00:35:08.235 --> 00:35:11.879
Please remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something we make together.

00:35:11.899 --> 00:35:14.423
You know, you're a part of this.

00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:15.805
That's all.

00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:18.348
You know, please use the hashtag.

00:35:18.368 --> 00:35:18.929

00:35:18.949 --> 00:35:20.951
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:35:21.032 --> 00:35:22.594
Give us your questions, Ruffians.

00:35:22.614 --> 00:35:23.034
Send it!

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:26.539
You know, there's no better way to ask us a question than through this hashtag.

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:29.743
We have a question, you know, and post it in chat, but then we don't read it.

00:35:30.925 --> 00:35:31.245
One.

00:35:32.693 --> 00:35:46.178
Pero Sighting's not so happy, but it's important.

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:48.663
The Ruffians need to know.

00:35:48.903 --> 00:35:52.069
I love seeing your walks too.

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:59.165
So don't forget to use the hashtag okay?

00:35:59.686 --> 00:36:01.309
BAU BAU!

00:36:02.151 --> 00:36:05.218
And we have another stream coming up later this evening.

00:36:05.478 --> 00:36:08.264
Very soon we have De-den!

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.429
I schedule.

00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:14.576
Tonight, we're gonna be having a members-only stream with the Doggy Pack!

00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:21.526
This time, we're gonna be doing an after-party for our most recent cover song release of Crescent Moon!

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:21.647
Yeah!

00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.910
Our very first English cover song!

00:36:27.075 --> 00:36:27.476
Yeah, Crescent Moon!

00:36:27.496 --> 00:36:28.397
If you haven't listened, please go listen!

00:36:28.417 --> 00:36:29.859
If you just go to the videos page, then it's right there.

00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:30.380
Right there!

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.242
You know!

00:36:31.262 --> 00:36:36.169
But this way, usually we'd have it, you know, a little bit closer to where the videos were.

00:36:36.189 --> 00:36:37.952
Yeah, usually next to the really...

00:36:38.303 --> 00:36:39.545
Doggy Pack.

00:36:40.146 --> 00:36:43.172
Doggy Pack.

00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:44.755
Doggy Pack.

00:36:46.097 --> 00:36:54.793
Doggy Pack.

00:36:54.773 --> 00:36:56.335
I'm looking forward to it.

00:36:56.355 --> 00:37:01.963
And then, also you know, this week more N-RECORD!

00:37:01.983 --> 00:37:03.045
FUWAMOCO Morning N-RECORD!

00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:06.550
And the N-RECORD finale will be on Saturday the 10th.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.055
The big, dramatic, I'm sure, conclusion.

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:11.216
Something happens, huh?

00:37:11.657 --> 00:37:13.259
Something does happen, it's the conclusion.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:22.873
And then, on the 11th, we're gonna be having a very special hololive among us collab because it's BAU's birthday!

00:37:24.052 --> 00:37:27.757
FUWAMOCO's first birthday!

00:37:27.777 --> 00:37:32.163
A big birthday, so we couldn't be there playing Among Us.

00:37:32.604 --> 00:37:34.667
I know how that went last time.

00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:36.349
It went, it went, yeah.

00:37:37.271 --> 00:37:38.252
Swimming.

00:37:38.272 --> 00:37:39.294
Yes.

00:37:39.414 --> 00:37:43.900
So we hope that you'll join us by this week, especially in our

00:37:44.774 --> 00:37:46.699
BAU BAU!

00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:51.631
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:51.672 --> 00:37:54.820
Now for the Ruffians joining us in the archive!

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.910
New FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU Koi Koi!

00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:00.133
