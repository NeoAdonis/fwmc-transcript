Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:20.049
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.433
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:26.996
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:30.419
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.243
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:34.443 --> 00:05:38.507
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:38.887
BAU BAU!

00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:42.951
And today we will host a FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:48.559
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for a brand new week!

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:51.183
And here today for our 144th episode!

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:56.310
BAU BAU!

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.512
Thank you!

00:05:57.532 --> 00:05:58.073
BAU BAU!

00:05:58.093 --> 00:05:59.675
Thank you Ruffians!

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:03.020
FUWAMOCO-chan, you're feeling much better now, right?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.804
I feel better.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:06.204
Thank you Ruffians!

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:07.566
Thank you!

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:09.869
But it's a new week!

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:10.390
So we're ready.

00:06:11.011 --> 00:06:14.036
Maybe, maybe there's some Ruffians out.

00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:15.698
This is your first time today.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.788
If I ask, Ruffians is gonna be, yeah, all gonna be saying, yeah, my first time.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.691
I feel like there's some Ruffians out.

00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.998
Maybe there's a first time?

00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:28.598
Yeah.

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.959
I'm feeling buff.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.820
What?

00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:31.803
I'm feeling buff, Moco-chan.

00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:35.990
My head was feeling buff.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.272
In a bad way, right?

00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:40.577
You new here?

00:06:40.597 --> 00:06:41.900
I don't think you new here.

00:06:43.764 --> 00:06:54.629
Those that are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday and Monday.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.876
Taken in FUWAMOCO and is hosted by us,

00:06:57.856 --> 00:06:59.418
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:05.205
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:08.229
Please tweet it onto the hashtag!

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.253

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:15.598
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.081
BAU BAU!

00:07:18.762 --> 00:07:20.404
Hashtag hashtag.

00:07:20.384 --> 00:07:22.346
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:25.369
BAU BAU!

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.631
First time you watch FUWAMOCO Morning this week?

00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.151
Wow!

00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:28.912
It's a new week?

00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:29.893
I wouldn't expect that.

00:07:31.454 --> 00:07:35.658
BAU BAU!

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:38.561
Let's start it off on the right paw.

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.962
Right, Moco-chan?

00:07:41.764 --> 00:07:49.311
You know, I think the Ruffians noticed something's a little bit different today about FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:53.222
Some things don't really change that much.

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:53.323
Huh?

00:07:53.904 --> 00:07:57.873
Huh?

00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:58.394
Ruffians.

00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:03.967
It's been another Pero sighting!

00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:08.397
BAU BAU!

00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:13.880
I do appreciate the Pero Sightings, Ruffians, but you know what?

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.227
Making sure that all the Ruffians don't have to deal with the nastiness, but I'm just sad about that.

00:08:19.287 --> 00:08:21.890
Why does it have to be the beginning every time, FUWAMOCO-chan?

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:22.892
Why is this important?

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:26.997
Well, let's see where Pero will spoil the day.

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:27.117
Okay.

00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:28.859
Let's check it out.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.923
De-den!

00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:35.828
Huh?

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:36.088
Huh?

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.155
Someone very nasty decided to sneak into your bed.

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:42.276
Huh?

00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:46.802
He's not going back to bed, is he?

00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:46.902
Huh?

00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:50.266
Don't try to make the Ruffians sleepy again, Pero, okay?

00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:51.688
Cute?

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.709
Not cute!

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.011
No!

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:55.453
Ugly!

00:08:55.553 --> 00:09:02.362
It does look comfy there with us on either side, but... You know, Ruffians, the new week is just starting!

00:09:03.003 --> 00:09:05.586
You know you can't go back to bed!

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:12.101
You know, it might still be cold outside, but once you get warning in a- warning?

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:14.792
Once you get a warning, you'll be warm.

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:17.382
Very ominous!

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:21.276
Five more minutes?

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:21.696
No!

00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:23.078
No, Ruffians!

00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:23.918
No!

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:25.620
FUWAMOCO Morning is now!

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.222
It started four minutes ago!

00:09:27.322 --> 00:09:31.606
Yeah, so... No more five more minutes!

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:32.527
A day has started!

00:09:32.547 --> 00:09:34.729
It's gonna start on the right paw!

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.953
Don't let Pero entice you back into battle, kay?

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:40.915
Does he fit well underneath your arm?

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:43.698
Does he?

00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:44.719
Tempting.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.558
Gotta watch out, cute Ruffians, before you know it, there'll be a tongue there.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.543
Why?

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:53.247
In your armpit!

00:09:53.608 --> 00:09:56.054
Yeah.

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:58.500
Gotta be careful.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.465
Try your own caution.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.392
Okay?

00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:03.653
BAU BAU!

00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:07.025
Ruffians!

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:14.238
You might have heard all of a sudden there was a question question question mark on our schedule before last week.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:22.333
But the other day we actually had a collab with Subaru-senpai over on her channel!

00:10:22.313 --> 00:10:26.717
BAU BAU!

00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:26.937
BAU BAU!

00:10:26.997 --> 00:10:29.860
Now we went to Subaru no Koya!

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.882
Ojamashimashita!

00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:33.003
Subaru's sack?

00:10:33.964 --> 00:10:34.965
Shack sack?

00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:35.746
Cabin.

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:36.667
Cabin?

00:10:36.687 --> 00:10:43.033
I think some Ruffians got confused and thought we went to Subaru-senpai's cabin by the lake.

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:43.933
No.

00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.095
Subaru's place.

00:10:47.237 --> 00:10:48.718
Yes.

00:10:49.158 --> 00:10:50.920
But...

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.474
Ojamashimashita yo!

00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:58.940
We are in the facility together with Subaru-senpai and she asked us a bunch of different questions.

00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:03.147
Also by you Ruffians and Subaru-tomo!

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:08.355
Thank you Ruffians for so many great questions!

00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:10.298
I know we chatted a bunch.

00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:12.020
Omoshirokatta!

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.201
Yokatta!

00:11:12.982 --> 00:11:15.325
A bunch of different things we talked about you know.

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:20.333
Somehow we ended up talking about a lot of different very

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:23.499
Otaku-like topics.

00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:30.773
There was a mention of a new holo somewhere called Holosukumisu.

00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:35.863
I don't know, that was just maybe something Subaru-senpai was secretly thinking about.

00:11:36.164 --> 00:11:38.949
Oh, it was Subaru-senpai that brought it up, right?

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.871
Yes!

00:11:40.753 --> 00:11:40.853
Yeah.

00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:42.989
Or maybe it's in Subatomo!

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.833
Yes, blame the Subatomo, yes.

00:11:46.993 --> 00:11:49.075
Don't blame her!

00:11:49.155 --> 00:11:52.519
Okay, but blame the Subatomo.

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:58.805
But there was some very heated discussion too about glasses and socks.

00:11:58.825 --> 00:12:03.690
Subaru-senpai never told us what kind of glasses are her favorite.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.595
I wanna hear more about what Subaru-senpai likes for glasses.

00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:14.054
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:28.879
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:12:28.859 --> 00:12:33.107
That's the last question, you know.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:37.737
But you know, after week 2 we got to chat a bunch with Subaru-senpai.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.784
So we're really really happy.

00:12:42.265 --> 00:12:45.873
We got a bunch of helpful advice and tips.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:50.682
You know Subaru-senpai was so kind and welcoming.

00:12:51.742 --> 00:12:54.687
We also got sent on a little journey too!

00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:55.168
We did!

00:12:55.188 --> 00:12:55.348
We did!

00:12:55.428 --> 00:12:56.049
Otsukai!

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:58.594
To get some lettuce and buns.

00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:01.278
And some coffee mugs.

00:13:01.298 --> 00:13:02.140
It was fun.

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:10.915
If you want this brand or this brand or this one or the big one or the small one.

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:15.744
We are really really happy to be able to help you.

00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:18.750
We hope that you go check it out.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.153
It's on Subaru-senpai's channel.

00:13:20.173 --> 00:13:25.483
But hopefully we can go out together with Subaru-senpai soon again.

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:29.972
Thank you for having us over Subaru-senpai!

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:31.334
BAU BAU!

00:13:31.354 --> 00:13:31.635
BAU BAU!

00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:33.358
Ruffians!

00:13:33.338 --> 00:13:37.502
If you were listening too, maybe you heard.

00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:42.708
But while doing a collab with Subaru-senpai, there was a little corner.

00:13:42.728 --> 00:13:43.069
Yeah, a wheel.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:44.870
Yeah, we spawned a special wheel.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:52.399
And, FUWAMOCO, we happened to land on the shared secret that you haven't shared.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:52.719
Square.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:53.159
Square.

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:53.440
Pizza.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:53.940
Slice.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.263
It wasn't really a square.

00:13:56.283 --> 00:13:58.145
Slice, yeah.

00:13:58.265 --> 00:14:00.207
But, well...

00:14:00.676 --> 00:14:04.189
Thought and thought and thought and then realized!

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.981
A new arrival!

00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:11.046
To the doghouse!

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:11.987
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:12.148 --> 00:14:19.299
We got our paws on an ASMR mode!

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:20.240
It's happening!

00:14:21.943 --> 00:14:22.423
How beautiful!

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:26.049
Excited?

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.792
We still don't have it set up.

00:14:28.272 --> 00:14:29.234
No, not at all.

00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.898
We are unpacked.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.151
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:37.135
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:37.415 --> 00:14:41.241
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:42.422
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:42.442 --> 00:14:43.143
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:43.163 --> 00:14:44.004
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:45.066
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:45.527 --> 00:14:47.689
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:50.573
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:52.196
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:52.877
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:53.798
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:53.818 --> 00:14:54.239
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.500
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.082
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:57.102 --> 00:14:58.064
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:58.084 --> 00:14:58.845
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:59.225 --> 00:14:59.606
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:00.127
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:00.667
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:15:00.687 --> 00:15:01.428
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:15:01.448 --> 00:15:01.849
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:02.610
Good job, F

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:08.130
I know we're going to start learning with the Doggy Pack membership.

00:15:08.351 --> 00:15:11.355
Maybe first after doing some training here and there.

00:15:11.976 --> 00:15:15.261
So we hope that you'll listen with kind ears there.

00:15:15.401 --> 00:15:16.843
I could've definitely stumbled.

00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:19.427
My ears are saying that they can't wait.

00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:23.153
We'll learn together, okay?

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:27.720
Yeah, Chou-senpai would love to give us ASMR lessons.

00:15:28.865 --> 00:15:40.747
We like that too, but... Yeah... But we still just, you know, in for more... Puppies?

00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:41.389
Babies?

00:15:42.972 --> 00:15:45.497
We're still at the starting line.

00:15:45.537 --> 00:15:53.090
We'll definitely stumble lots, but... Yeah, but we're still nervous.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.392
We don't really know that much, you know.

00:15:54.793 --> 00:15:56.256
But that is true, you know.

00:15:56.276 --> 00:16:02.567
We do have a little bit of experience because, well, we released earlier last year.

00:16:03.543 --> 00:16:08.151
Hey, voice FUWAMOCO is a live voice produced by Patra Onee-san!

00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:17.626
And you can get it like now the hololive official shop too, but, you know, now with this don't mean we can do some streams.

00:16:18.287 --> 00:16:21.673
But, there's definitely a lot of learning still needed.

00:16:21.753 --> 00:16:23.796
Definitely accidents that will happen.

00:16:24.637 --> 00:16:26.479
Especially Moco-chan.

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:31.945
Look forward to it!

00:16:31.965 --> 00:16:32.445
BAU BAU!

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:35.809
But speaking of the voice... Ruffians!

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.151
I don't know.

00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:39.733
Somehow, it keeps on happening.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:42.877
This is my new voice pack!

00:16:43.317 --> 00:16:45.820
BAU BAU!

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.403
Let's take a look at which one it is this time.

00:16:48.423 --> 00:16:49.564
We have...

00:16:50.303 --> 00:16:51.725
Partner voice pack.

00:16:51.925 --> 00:16:52.506
What is this?

00:16:52.967 --> 00:16:55.270
It's different from the detective voice pack.

00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:55.591
Right.

00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:58.796
Detectives have a partner, but this is a partner voice pack.

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:00.979
Are you keeping up with them, Mofi?

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:02.501
Every month you already got them?

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.643
I don't know if it's every month.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.229
I feel like it's almost every week now.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.370
Right.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.678
But this time, you know, I think most recently there was the Noises voice pack.

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:16.543
And the Enrico voice pack.

00:17:16.943 --> 00:17:19.467
And the Spring Revelry voice pack.

00:17:19.447 --> 00:17:21.530
Partner voice pack.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.213
Detective voice pack.

00:17:23.393 --> 00:17:24.656
Detective voice pack.

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.176
No!

00:17:25.216 --> 00:17:29.383
The partner voice pack!

00:17:29.844 --> 00:17:30.084
What?

00:17:30.144 --> 00:17:32.829
What's the partner voice pack, Moco-chan?

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:36.595
What part is?

00:17:36.575 --> 00:17:38.097
I'm searching for something.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.541
We're searching.

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:43.865
We're fireflies together!

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:45.988
Moco-chan.

00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:46.810
Partners in crime?

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.777
Kind of like that without the, you know... Without the crime, just fireflies.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.639
At this time, Ruffians!

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.646
For the first time, we get to do yoga together!

00:17:58.667 --> 00:17:59.368
I'm gonna teach you.

00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:02.532
Although I don't really know that much, so...

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.443
Oh my goodness, you are about to get a nice stretch.

00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:06.104
A stretch?

00:18:06.344 --> 00:18:07.305
Not stress.

00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:20.722
Stretch together, so... Hopefully we don't become soggy doggies or anything, but... I see a lot more yoga, yoga, yoga, no... Fireflies!

00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:23.746
I don't know, Moco-chan.

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:28.872
Maybe the Ruffians just feel a little like... A little tight, you know, and you get a bit stressed.

00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:29.633
You're not one of me, my partner!

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:36.602
I don't know if fireflies are downward dogs or not.

00:18:40.227 --> 00:18:42.210
Hi!

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.415
BAU BAU!

00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:52.946
Ruffians, either way to go, you can go and take a listen to the sample on the hololive official song.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:58.014
And if you want to be partners in crime, maybe the detective voice pack is good for you too.

00:18:58.495 --> 00:19:01.840
It's still available, so please check it out!

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.003
BAU BAU!

00:19:04.023 --> 00:19:07.348
We'll continue to do our best at the voice packs, but Ruffians,

00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:08.450
There's a lot of them.

00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:16.525
So we hope that you have a lot of fun and maybe you find which one is, you know, this is definitely my kind of thing.

00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:19.211
The voice pack for me.

00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:19.491
Yeah.

00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:22.336
BAU BAU!

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:22.637
Ruffians!

00:19:22.617 --> 00:19:25.743
It's mine!

00:19:26.184 --> 00:19:29.109
No, it's FUWAMOCO morning.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:30.652
It's morning.

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:30.912
Yeah.

00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:31.473
It's fun.

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:32.876
It's really lovely here.

00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:33.597
Yeah.

00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:33.918
Okay.

00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:38.867
Well, Ruffians, we also have some news, you know.

00:19:39.168 --> 00:19:42.053
Maybe for some busy Ruffians, you're kind of like, huh?

00:19:42.073 --> 00:19:43.035
Wait, what's going on?

00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:44.538
Maybe you didn't even notice.

00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:45.840
But...

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.304
FUWAMOCO!

00:19:51.188 --> 00:19:51.388
Good news!

00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:51.969
We beat Little Witch Nobita!

00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:53.932
BAU BAU!

00:19:54.373 --> 00:19:56.115
Maybe like, huh?

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.697
This isn't a new game.

00:19:57.717 --> 00:19:59.240
I haven't heard of this game.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.062
You've been playing a game like this?

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:02.985
Yes, we have.

00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:04.027
We have been.

00:20:04.507 --> 00:20:08.033
Last time we played it was on September 2023.

00:20:08.253 --> 00:20:09.735
Yeah.

00:20:10.863 --> 00:20:11.546
Yeah!

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:12.953
Yeah!

00:20:12.973 --> 00:20:13.656
We did it!

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.464
We finally did it!

00:20:15.484 --> 00:20:17.092
It was a hard game, right Moco-chan?

00:20:17.976 --> 00:20:18.257
Yes.

00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:20.374
It was originally.

00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:21.896
Yeah.

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.238
On controller it was hard.

00:20:24.258 --> 00:20:25.279
On keyboard it was not.

00:20:27.722 --> 00:20:28.743
Yeah!

00:20:29.284 --> 00:20:31.026
That long in between, huh?

00:20:31.046 --> 00:20:33.428
You know there's a lot of fun things.

00:20:33.448 --> 00:20:35.310
I was good, right?

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.590
Yeah.

00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:36.792
Only dodging.

00:20:36.812 --> 00:20:41.637
You know when you have a lot of fun things going on, sometimes other fun things happen in between.

00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:44.420
And then before you know, some months go by.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.244
And then before you know, six months go by.

00:20:48.224 --> 00:20:50.347
Yeah.

00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:51.629
But we did it!

00:20:51.649 --> 00:20:53.012
And there's been a lot of improvement.

00:20:53.032 --> 00:20:55.716
So much improvement that our save data disappeared.

00:20:56.097 --> 00:21:01.786
But that's okay because Moco-chan is a pro and no bosses stopped you.

00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:04.370
I got the save data more or less back before.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.176
Yeah, and we got lots of costumes.

00:21:08.196 --> 00:21:09.718
Please play more Soul Link.

00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:11.902
Soul Link?

00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:14.245
Like what one?

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:15.868
Is there more with cute girls?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.812
Those legs are cute girls.

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:23.578
Maybe one with dark souls.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.140
I have a feeling it doesn't help.

00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.143
A cute dragon princess?

00:21:28.544 --> 00:21:29.386
A cute crab?

00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:33.591
Crabs are cute, but a cute crab is different from a cute girl.

00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:35.114
Dragon princess?

00:21:35.134 --> 00:21:35.654
Crab princess?

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:36.155
Sure.

00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:39.780
I'll go for that.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.032
Huh?

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:43.454
I see a lot of different games.

00:21:43.474 --> 00:21:45.917
I've never heard of these ones so I'll have to search them up.

00:21:46.077 --> 00:21:46.978
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:21:46.998 --> 00:21:47.139
Hi.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.062
Maybe some could suggest these cute turtles.

00:21:50.683 --> 00:21:51.725
Is that the title of the game?

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:51.805
Hi.

00:21:54.949 --> 00:21:58.414
Now I'm picturing what like a soulslug would look like with a turtle.

00:21:58.614 --> 00:21:59.956
I don't think it'd be very fast.

00:22:00.597 --> 00:22:03.501
It could just... Oh, true.

00:22:03.601 --> 00:22:07.967
I was picturing a fast turtle, you know, that could run really well because the shell is hard.

00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:09.409
No.

00:22:09.429 --> 00:22:10.510
It would be a long game.

00:22:13.612 --> 00:22:17.917
BAU BAU!

00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:18.778
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:22.061
Thank you for waiting so long to see Nobeta's conclusion!

00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:27.127
If you haven't seen Nobeta before, please check it out as well, even though it's more or less from the start.

00:22:28.168 --> 00:22:28.668
Don't worry!

00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:32.613
BAU BAU!

00:22:32.653 --> 00:22:35.216
We're happy to be able to complete it!

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:37.358
Moco-chan, you were very confident about it.

00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:42.307
BAU BAU!

00:22:42.407 --> 00:22:44.631
Ruffians!

00:22:45.092 --> 00:22:56.592
You might have kind of heard but right now currently we have a very special collaboration going on with an apparel brand called Anime Gear Girls!

00:22:56.612 --> 00:22:57.253
BAU BAU!

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:02.478
Anime gear gonna make special anime-inspired apparel.

00:23:02.918 --> 00:23:09.244
And this time, you can get your paws on FUWAMOCO-themed jackets and more!

00:23:09.364 --> 00:23:12.147
Have you seen it on Twitter?

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:12.927
Maybe!

00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:13.648
So cool!

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.011
Is that a onesie?

00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:18.773
It is not a onesie!

00:23:18.793 --> 00:23:21.195
It's even better than that!

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:22.756
But finally, Ruffians!

00:23:23.497 --> 00:23:24.338
The time has come!

00:23:24.378 --> 00:23:26.700
You can have matching jackets together!

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.583
Hey guys!

00:23:28.603 --> 00:23:31.366
As you can see, we have Fuwawa fans!

00:23:31.386 --> 00:23:32.308
Look at my jacket.

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:38.376
It's very faithfully replicated, but you know, a little bit more functional maybe for you Ruffians.

00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:41.620
You know, it's just as long as my jacket.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.146
It has a little, you know, a little cutout there for my tail.

00:23:46.587 --> 00:23:49.851
Maybe not as convenient for you, but I'll explain.

00:23:49.871 --> 00:23:51.693
But it's a long denim jacket.

00:23:52.294 --> 00:23:55.118
It's very, very, very, very close.

00:23:55.098 --> 00:23:59.347
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:10.812
Have a howl of a day!

00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:15.962
Next we have my jacket!

00:24:16.323 --> 00:24:22.915
It's also detachable, but this time it goes into a short crop Mococo-style denim jacket!

00:24:23.677 --> 00:24:27.424
It can be a bit hard to imagine, but we'll still put photos here, okay?

00:24:27.704 --> 00:24:29.728
Let's take a look maybe.

00:24:29.708 --> 00:24:36.035
You know, both jackets have very high quality embroidery and it's also a very heavy fabric.

00:24:36.055 --> 00:24:37.497
It's a heavy weighted denim.

00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:40.381
Yeah, you know, you might think, is the jacket fuzzy?

00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:40.981
No, it's not fuzzy.

00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:43.004
It's anime inspired, right?

00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:45.567
So you know, like, the design you think would be most important.

00:24:45.887 --> 00:24:48.911
But, obviously the design is very important.

00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:56.079
But the materials, like, this is a very, very... We were very surprised that it's very, very durable, heavy material.

00:24:56.379 --> 00:24:58.602
It's going to keep you warm.

00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:05.833
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:06.534 --> 00:25:18.852
Have a howl of a day!

00:25:19.372 --> 00:25:21.174
Special hats!

00:25:21.294 --> 00:25:21.475
Yes!

00:25:21.595 --> 00:25:22.496
Not just jackets!

00:25:22.636 --> 00:25:23.758
There's two different hats.

00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:26.842
Both a dad hat and a bucket hat.

00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:28.203
This is a bucket hat.

00:25:28.223 --> 00:25:29.245
This is a dad hat.

00:25:29.365 --> 00:25:29.525
I think.

00:25:29.585 --> 00:25:29.946
No.

00:25:30.426 --> 00:25:31.187
A hat.

00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:33.029
This is a dad hat!

00:25:34.111 --> 00:25:35.312
Not just a bucket hat.

00:25:35.392 --> 00:25:36.514
This is a dad hat.

00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:38.356
This is the one that has the front.

00:25:38.717 --> 00:25:39.878
The one that looks like a duck.

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:41.140
But it's a dad hat.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.081
Yeah.

00:25:43.383 --> 00:25:43.863
Yes!

00:25:43.883 --> 00:25:46.807
But they also have very nice embroidery on them as well!

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:47.188
Right!

00:25:47.208 --> 00:25:47.908
Yeah, mom's wearing it.

00:25:47.949 --> 00:25:48.349
Yes.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.939
If you maybe take a closer look once you get your paws on it, you'll be really surprised.

00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:57.669
There's some secrets too.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.472
But!

00:25:58.492 --> 00:26:01.022
Why don't you take a look at some of the photos?

00:26:01.677 --> 00:26:07.883
Okay, so the jacket is very heavy in denim and it's gonna keep you warm.

00:26:08.163 --> 00:26:13.829
But the lining is so cute and it's really plushy and warm and soft.

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:21.556
And it has a kind of like, a bit of a shiny, like a shininess to it.

00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:23.078
It's a very nice liner.

00:26:23.238 --> 00:26:24.199
Very nice.

00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:27.001
It's kind of like, you know, almost like a blanket kind of.

00:26:27.382 --> 00:26:28.483
Very ruffy.

00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:30.705
I don't want to tell.

00:26:32.255 --> 00:26:49.285
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:49.265 --> 00:26:58.125
Pretty big zipper, so you know you're not gonna have to worry about... Actually, I can't get it off or I can't get it back on!

00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:07.746
We were checking out the sample and one thing we sort of discovered is that, you know, if you have a friend that maybe forgot their jacket and they're home...

00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:12.322
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:12.383 --> 00:27:15.310
Have a howl of a day!

00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:17.837
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:21.887
Have a howl of a day!

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:30.577
That's what I was doing, I was using it as a shawl.

00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.761
And there's so many pockets too, Ruffians!

00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:37.566
If you like pockets, there's pockets!

00:27:37.586 --> 00:27:43.032
And for Mococo, you can also see it has the detachable part.

00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:49.360
It's literally a regular jacket, but an amulet.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:28:19.347
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:19.327 --> 00:28:20.729
I don't want my arm in the frame.

00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:21.810
But you want to be cool.

00:28:22.511 --> 00:28:25.695
Like an anime character and put it on your shoulder.

00:28:25.715 --> 00:28:25.816
Yeah.

00:28:26.136 --> 00:28:29.280
You're going to maybe walk through like a big gust of wind.

00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:32.584
But you don't really... You want to have your arms free.

00:28:32.605 --> 00:28:32.705
Yeah.

00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:36.109
That's exactly what you could do, you know.

00:28:36.129 --> 00:28:37.851
Like a cape.

00:28:38.552 --> 00:28:38.833
Yes, exactly!

00:28:38.853 --> 00:28:40.575
But cooler than a cape.

00:28:40.943 --> 00:28:52.641
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:57.636
That was the secret all along, and now you can be the hero!

00:28:57.957 --> 00:29:03.023
You can be Moco-chan, you can be Fuwawa, it's all up to you!

00:29:03.043 --> 00:29:06.087
Yeah, and then we have a close-up on the hat too!

00:29:06.107 --> 00:29:08.930
There's lots of embroidery, so it's very very nice.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:17.942
You know, both Fuwawa and Moco-chan, so you know you're like, I don't know, I don't know which jacket I like, I like both jackets!

00:29:18.462 --> 00:29:19.023
You know?

00:29:19.103 --> 00:29:22.948
Well, we actually have some extra details here!

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:29.358
Due to high demand, the pre-order period has actually been extended until April 30th, 2025.

00:29:29.899 --> 00:29:33.284
So make sure you get your pre-order in before then!

00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:36.489
You still have time, Ruffians, but don't forget why!

00:29:36.829 --> 00:29:44.401
There's also a special limited offer where if you're indecisive or you're like, you know, I love jackets, I want to be warm.

00:29:44.421 --> 00:29:49.889
If you get both jackets, you'll also receive both hats for free!

00:29:51.252 --> 00:29:51.552
BAU BAU!

00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:58.924
And there's also free shipping to the US for orders of over $150 or more!

00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:08.319
But because of the updated pre-order period, the shipping time is estimated now to be late July to early August 2025.

00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:13.067
So you know maybe it'll arrive just in back when it's starting to get

00:30:13.047 --> 00:30:25.095
BAU BAU!

00:30:25.556 --> 00:30:29.325
Thank you!

00:30:29.365 --> 00:30:31.731
Free shipping!

00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:33.834
BAU BAU!

00:30:34.275 --> 00:30:35.196
Wow!

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:37.920
Let's take a look, you know we looked at some doggies.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.624
Now let's take a look at who's the Doggie of the Day today.

00:30:40.684 --> 00:30:48.395
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Zeus!

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:51.259
BAU BAU!

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:51.339
Hi!

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:55.385
Look at the sparkly round eyes!

00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:59.811
I'm here, what are you doing?

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:05.138
But Zeus is in fact a chihuahua and a beagle mix.

00:31:05.498 --> 00:31:08.262
No Fuwawa or demon dog here.

00:31:09.003 --> 00:31:10.605
But he really loves to cuddle.

00:31:11.847 --> 00:31:14.350
Look at the super cute and fashionable sweater.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.973
I want a sweater like that.

00:31:17.073 --> 00:31:19.416
Zeus also has a nice cute jacket, huh?

00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:20.718
Right.

00:31:20.818 --> 00:31:22.240
I wish he had one.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.807
I don't know, if I had a sweater like that, it might not suit me as well as it suits Zeus.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:37.231
We're not supposed to underestimate him because he looks cute, but... No!

00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:38.813
He's cute!

00:31:39.714 --> 00:31:44.601
Wow, Moco-chan, how does Zeus bow-bow?

00:31:45.182 --> 00:31:55.016
Maybe like... Awai!

00:31:55.036 --> 00:31:55.136
Awai!

00:31:55.156 --> 00:31:55.356
Like that!

00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:55.476
Awai!

00:31:56.097 --> 00:31:56.538
Zeus!

00:31:57.199 --> 00:31:58.941
The Beagle Chihuahua Mix!

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.331
BAU BAU!

00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:05.395
I'm cute!

00:32:05.595 --> 00:32:05.815
I'm cute!

00:32:07.297 --> 00:32:08.778
BAU BAU!

00:32:08.798 --> 00:32:12.562
Well, this is, yeah, a bagel-chihuahua mix.

00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:16.386
But, I feel like you know more than the chihuahua part.

00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:22.473
I see the bagel, maybe the bagel, the gourmet bagel part coming up.

00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:23.574
Bagel bread!

00:32:23.594 --> 00:32:23.874
Baked toasted!

00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:24.595
Gourmet bagel!

00:32:25.396 --> 00:32:27.798
Yeah, and a bouncy cafe, you know!

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.261
Can be like, oh, what do you like on your cafe?

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:51.439
FUWAMOCO

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:54.384
But Zeus is very cute.

00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:57.849
Looks like a very sweet doggy.

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:59.412
But you know, Zeus is Zeus.

00:33:00.293 --> 00:33:04.841
Maybe not so powerful like the god in the sky yet.

00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:06.443
No, it's just a gourmet bagel.

00:33:06.463 --> 00:33:10.049
But you know, I'm sure that he'll become a great guard dog soon.

00:33:11.351 --> 00:33:12.653
BAU BAU!

00:33:12.673 --> 00:33:13.815
Bagel for now.

00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:18.261
And for today, I wanna walk!

00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:19.803
Ruffians!

00:33:20.564 --> 00:33:22.686
Let's go on a walk, huh?

00:33:25.249 --> 00:33:29.415
Let's check it out!

00:33:29.455 --> 00:33:29.635
De-den!

00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:32.859
Let's walk around Shinjuku on the way!

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:37.104
And you know, it's a very necessary stop at Mise-d'oeuvre!

00:33:40.028 --> 00:33:40.609
Ruffians!

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:43.212
Why?

00:33:44.677 --> 00:33:47.519
Why would you eat a pon-de-ring like this?

00:33:50.342 --> 00:33:55.807
You know, well, you can eat it however you feel is most delicious to you, right?

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.988
That's okay.

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.630
But, uh, this is a first!

00:34:00.911 --> 00:34:01.412
I don't know.

00:34:01.512 --> 00:34:03.754
I feel like it's almost hard to look at, right?

00:34:03.774 --> 00:34:04.114
Right.

00:34:04.134 --> 00:34:07.957
I don't want to look at it.

00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:13.642
Yeah, if you look really hard at it, it kind of looks like, you know, a pon-de-ring has been turned inside out.

00:34:13.682 --> 00:34:14.363
I know.

00:34:16.334 --> 00:34:18.036
Yeah, how do you even eat it like that?

00:34:18.076 --> 00:34:19.378
Right, right.

00:34:19.398 --> 00:34:20.540
It looks cool.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.742
I think that's wrong.

00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:25.467
Godzilla did it, I don't know about that.

00:34:26.809 --> 00:34:29.433
We're gonna blame it on Godzilla.

00:34:29.453 --> 00:34:30.715
No, I don't think that's fair.

00:34:30.755 --> 00:34:37.785
I don't think Yofi-senpai would be okay with that.

00:34:37.805 --> 00:34:40.008
We have to think of Yofi-senpai right now.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.291
We're being considerate.

00:34:43.756 --> 00:34:49.242
We hope you enjoyed it even though you ate it interestingly in an inside out way.

00:34:50.103 --> 00:34:58.373
But hopefully Godzilla didn't surprise you too much either.

00:34:58.393 --> 00:34:58.553
BAU BAU!

00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:02.417
And for the Question of the Day!

00:35:02.838 --> 00:35:05.701
What question did we receive from the Ruffians?

00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:07.283
De-den!

00:35:07.904 --> 00:35:09.786
Oh, I'm curious!

00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:13.630
You both went back for a bit to the northwest passage, right?

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.653
How are the plants you have back there doing?

00:35:17.273 --> 00:35:18.755
Did they have enough water?

00:35:19.215 --> 00:35:22.238
It's been at the back of my mind for a while now.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.941
FUWAMO- FUWAMO!

00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:31.047
Me and some Ruffians have forgot FUWAMOCO-chan, you have some so cute plants!

00:35:31.127 --> 00:35:32.849
I have some plants.

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:34.250
They're kind of like a cactus.

00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:35.992
I almost said cat boy.

00:35:36.012 --> 00:35:36.072
No.

00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:42.002
I'm a puppy.

00:35:43.104 --> 00:35:49.695
She's busy.

00:35:49.795 --> 00:35:50.877
No, she forgot.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.304
What do you think happened, Ruffians?

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:59.832
Any ideas?

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:04.970
Hi.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.994
Well, uh... Actually, they didn't get any bigger.

00:36:09.815 --> 00:36:09.915
Yeah.

00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:10.656
Uh, no growing.

00:36:11.096 --> 00:36:11.677
No growing.

00:36:11.817 --> 00:36:13.879
But they didn't get crispy and dry either.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.140
Yeah.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.661
It's just like time stopped for them.

00:36:17.582 --> 00:36:18.463
Yeah, time just stopped.

00:36:18.483 --> 00:36:19.504
They're the exact same.

00:36:19.524 --> 00:36:20.725
They look exactly the same.

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:21.566
Yeah.

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:24.089
Not any bigger, not any smaller, not any crispier.

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.209
Yeah.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.151
Maybe a little bit.

00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:28.013
A bit more dry.

00:36:28.673 --> 00:36:31.396
Not very plump.

00:36:31.476 --> 00:36:31.736
Yeah.

00:36:32.537 --> 00:36:32.637
Yeah.

00:36:33.832 --> 00:36:36.035
Ain't that interesting?

00:36:36.056 --> 00:36:36.516
Right.

00:36:37.277 --> 00:36:40.903
Yeah, but hopefully, no, hopefully Mama Puppy will remember tomorrow.

00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:41.524
A bit more.

00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:43.267
Yeah.

00:36:43.287 --> 00:36:44.329
Yeah.

00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:45.651
This is like the SNES.

00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:47.253
Maybe they're plastic?

00:36:48.054 --> 00:36:51.259
No, they're not plastic.

00:36:51.279 --> 00:36:53.383
I don't like plastic ones.

00:36:54.304 --> 00:36:55.947
I like the SNES!

00:36:55.967 --> 00:36:56.708
I like the SNES.

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:59.653
The SNES is stopped in time kind of, right?

00:36:59.673 --> 00:37:00.514
Yeah.

And you know, your walks too.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.701
It's getting so much the time.

00:37:38.982 --> 00:37:39.202
You know.

00:37:39.422 --> 00:37:40.663
Maybe the cherry blossoms.

00:37:40.723 --> 00:37:42.125
Maybe they're blooming.

00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:44.347
Maybe there's daffodils blooming.

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:45.568
Maybe something else is blooming.

00:37:45.588 --> 00:37:46.769
Maybe there's just something interesting.

00:37:46.789 --> 00:37:48.651
Maybe your heart is booming.

00:37:49.712 --> 00:37:51.633
Please let us know with the hashtag.

00:37:51.653 --> 00:37:52.334

BAU BAU!

00:37:53.515 --> 00:37:58.158
Thank you Ruffians!

00:37:58.178 --> 00:37:59.545

00:37:59.565 --> 00:38:00.268
Our next jam!

00:38:00.822 --> 00:38:04.406
FUWAMOCO Ruffians, this week is a busy week for us.

00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:09.231
And there's a lot of things that are still up in the air right now.

00:38:09.731 --> 00:38:12.874
So we don't have a schedule yet.

00:38:13.295 --> 00:38:16.799
But we'll let you know as soon as we can about our plans.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:25.187
And if we're not able to see you before then, we'll see you next during the very next FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:25.307 --> 00:38:27.910
We were trying to put together a schedule but...

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.692
It just keeps on changing.

00:38:29.713 --> 00:38:39.649
That's why we've kind of been a little bit quiet about the schedule, so... Yeah.

00:38:39.669 --> 00:38:40.370
BAU BAU!

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.913
Thank you for understanding, Ruffians!

00:38:41.933 --> 00:38:42.133
BAU BAU!

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.918
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive today!

00:38:45.178 --> 00:38:51.889
Your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU for puppies!

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.210
BAU BAU!

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:58.820

00:38:59.221 --> 00:39:05.871
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:39:06.512 --> 00:39:07.373
