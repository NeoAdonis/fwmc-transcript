00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.527
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:28.091
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.256
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:34.358
BAU BAU!

00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:35.019
Try that again.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.942
HAJIMARU YO!

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:40.405
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.025
That was strange.

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:45.016
It's okay, Moco-chan.

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:49.401
Because I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.484
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:55.327
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:57.349
BAU BAU!

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.596
And today, like every other FUWAMOCO almost, we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:10.180
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us for our 117th episode!

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.621
Our first episode after our 3D debut!

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:14.742
Yeah!

00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:16.562
BAU BAU!

00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:18.723
Are you surprised, Ruffians?

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.685
Maybe we're looking a little bit like usual.

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:25.900
Moco-chan, you have to call the doctor a little bit first, alright?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.625
Yeah, my eyes are feeling a little bit funny, huh?

00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:31.027
So we'll be like this for now?

00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:32.209
Yeah!

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.130
Okay!

00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.814
Well, let's continue our morning here!

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:36.235
Yeah!

00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:40.178
BAU BAU!

00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:44.621
Wow, for any Ruffians joining us for the first time today!

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:52.605
You know, after our 3D and everything, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:54.345
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:57.667
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:57.687 --> 00:07:03.170
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.911
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:08.451
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:13.032
Let's throw BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:15.833
BAU BAU!

00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:16.013
Ruffians!

00:07:19.734 --> 00:07:21.134
Another brand new weekend!

00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:25.475
A very, very special weekend!

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:29.596
Let's start it on the right paw, okay?

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.537
We don't need to worry about things because

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:40.146
Well... I think... There might have been a Pero Sighting.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:44.712
Ruffians!

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:47.296
Let's take a look, Moco-chan.

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:47.596
Okay.

00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:51.279
De-den!

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:53.961
BAU BAU!

00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:55.282
Why?

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.666
Why does Pero have to crash our 3D debut, huh?

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:02.388
We didn't see him for so long and then now!

00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.510
Of all times!

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:13.957
You know, I thought maybe... He was just busy with his birthday party and... You know, he'd be up to whatever he gets up to, but... No!

00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:17.921
He has to go and crash our 3D debut, huh?

00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:20.964
Well, Ruffians!

00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:23.125
Hopefully we showed him!

00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:27.988
You know, do you think, do you think he realizes that WE'RE THE TALK DOG!

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:28.148
Yeah!

00:08:28.888 --> 00:08:29.428
Yeah!

00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:30.569
Don't want Pero, yeah!

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:31.810
Nobody wants Pero!

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.890
Why?

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.251
Should we have been harder on him, you know?

00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:37.333
Maybe some more punches would have been better, Moco-chan.

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:37.993
Yeah.

00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:38.754
Yeah.

00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:41.255
He celebrated your 300th debut!

00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:44.337
You wanted to congratula- That was not a congratulation!

00:08:44.397 --> 00:08:45.697
He said he was the star of the show!

00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:46.298
Yeah!

00:08:46.978 --> 00:08:47.658
More kicks.

00:08:48.338 --> 00:08:49.239
More kicks?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.159
Can I stomp him?

00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:51.460
I could do more kicks.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.040
STOMP!

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.380
STOMP!

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.541
Ah, that's chill.

00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.141
We punched.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:55.601
Yeah.

00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.321
We punched.

00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:59.802
Just jump all over him.

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:02.843
And we're... Ah, next time into space.

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.504
That did pretty well.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.084
He went into the atmosphere.

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:07.285
Yeah.

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:09.945
The atmosphere is different from space, Moco-chan.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:10.966
But it's pretty close!

00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:12.226
I don't know.

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:15.088
Maybe we could've, we could've done it a little bit better.

00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:16.709
Do some wrestling moves on him!

00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:18.570
It's very round though.

00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.752
Yeah, he doesn't have any limbs, you know.

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:24.494
I guess we could grab a wing, but... We could just pull off the wings.

00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:25.234
We could!

00:09:25.254 --> 00:09:30.598
The wings... Maybe the eyes, the eyes, you know.

00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:32.619
Eyes are a weak point.

00:09:34.768 --> 00:09:35.048
How's that?

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:35.508
Yeah.

00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:35.708
Yeah.

00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:40.251
But that would be kinda nasty, sticking your fingers into Pero's eyes.

00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:42.251
It would probably feel like blueberries.

00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:42.672
Nasty eyes.

00:09:43.012 --> 00:09:43.272
Hot.

00:09:43.772 --> 00:09:44.953
Pero's blueberries?

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:45.713
Uh-uh.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:50.409
Well, we showed him who's boss, right?

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:51.890
Yeah, we're the top dogs!

00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.191
Right?

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:57.035
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:57.056 --> 00:09:58.277
Should be gone for a while now.

00:09:58.337 --> 00:09:59.418
For a while, yeah.

00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:00.699
Yeah, he's scared.

00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:02.040
BAU BAU!

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.324
BAU BAU!

00:10:05.724 --> 00:10:08.246
Well, I think it's kinda obvious what this is.

00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:10.188
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:11.869
We made our 3D debut!

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:12.429
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.372
BAU BAU!

00:10:16.472 --> 00:10:16.772
Yeah!

00:10:16.832 --> 00:10:17.913
You saw right!

00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:18.233
Yeah!

00:10:18.253 --> 00:10:18.573
Right!

00:10:18.914 --> 00:10:21.135
We had a ton of fun!

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:21.275
Yeah!

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:22.976
You watched right!

00:10:23.016 --> 00:10:23.977
You were damn right!

00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:25.518
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:25.578 --> 00:10:26.659
BAU BAU!

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:28.400
But, oh my gosh.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.761
We're so exhausted now.

00:10:32.388 --> 00:10:32.849
Yeah.

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:33.669
You do!

00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:35.471
We song and we dance!

00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:35.611
Yeah!

00:10:35.631 --> 00:10:36.411
We beat a Pero!

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:36.671
Yeah!

00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:37.652
We wrestle!

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:38.913
Yeah!

00:10:39.314 --> 00:10:39.614
You know?

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:41.406
I did a lot.

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:45.609
I think we probably made some Ruffians cry too!

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:47.671
I think it was pretty busy, huh?

00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:52.815
Yeah, but you know... We're really happy because... Yeah!

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:56.719
I think we were able to show off everything that we practiced so hard.

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:58.260
You're only there for the archive?

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.881
That's fine!

00:10:59.041 --> 00:10:59.882
Oh, thank you!

00:11:00.022 --> 00:11:00.682
Not only!

00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:00.943
Okay.

00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:01.363
Yeah.

00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:02.584
I'll let you cry.

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:06.347
That's okay!

00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:14.695
You know, it makes us really happy whether you're able to be there live or you know, maybe things are a little bit busy, you have work, maybe you're sleeping.

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:17.698
But we were so nervous!

00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:22.702
We were really nervous, but I'm glad we were able to do everything the best we could.

00:11:22.722 --> 00:11:24.224
I thought you enjoyed it with us.

00:11:24.504 --> 00:11:26.084
Yeah, and Ruffians!

00:11:26.484 --> 00:11:35.207
Thank you so much for being there, for watching the archive over and over, and for tweeting with our hashtag!

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:38.427
Hashtag FWMC3D so much too!

00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:47.489
You know, it was actually trending worldwide for so long despite, you know, there is Kumike and Olympic squadron!

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:48.490
Hi!

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.490
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.251
Apparently it's not a mistake, apparently it is true.

00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:55.772
I don't know.

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:57.852
It feels kind of funny.

00:11:57.872 --> 00:11:59.893
FUWAMOCO World Domination!

00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:00.073
Yay!

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:00.493
BAU BAU!

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:06.616
You've watched it for the third time already?

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:08.517
Thank you!

00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:21.082
Yeah, well, third time makes us really happy, but we hope that you know you'll watch it over and over, especially your favorite parts, and maybe you can share those with your friends too, Ruffians!

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:21.282
Yeah!

00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:27.965
But, you know, we put our... Every fiber of our flippin' fiber to our 3D debut!

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:30.046
It's all of us!

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:36.430
But, you know, we hope that we can continue to do even more amazing things with our 3D bodies here in hololive!

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:42.373
So please look forward to it and cheer us on, okay, Ruffians?

00:12:42.693 --> 00:12:44.014
You love Somi Shinne Taigyou?

00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:44.835
Yeah!

00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:47.076
Oh my god!

00:12:47.677 --> 00:12:47.877
Oh my!

00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:49.118
They wouldn't understand!

00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:51.020
Your friends wouldn't understand!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.061
Well, you don't know until you try.

00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:54.643
Just tell them, okay?

00:12:55.043 --> 00:12:57.945
See, there's these two twin demon dogs.

00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:00.107
And one of them you might think is a chihuahua.

00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:02.269
She's not a chihuahua, her name is Fuwawa.

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:06.152
And then you know, because they're twins, you might think the other one, oh that's Fuwawa.

00:13:06.232 --> 00:13:09.535
No, that's not Fuwawa, that's Mococo.

00:13:09.575 --> 00:13:11.317
Yeah, it's easy, okay?

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:12.838
Yeah, and then you just say, you know,

00:13:13.178 --> 00:13:15.820
They go bau bau, they sing, they dance, they wrestle!

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.761
Yeah, sing, dance, wrestle, huh?

00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:19.922
Yeah, and they'll protect you as well, and then... Yeah!

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:21.163
Easy dance!

00:13:21.203 --> 00:13:21.963
Easy dance!

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:23.364
They understand, right?

00:13:23.404 --> 00:13:24.425
Just like that.

00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:25.305
Right?

00:13:25.586 --> 00:13:27.227
There's nothing hard to understand.

00:13:27.727 --> 00:13:29.368
Not... not chihuahua.

00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:30.469
Not chihuahua?

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.849
No.

00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:31.589
Not Fuwawa.

00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:33.911
Then who is Kororo and Okaka?

00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:38.193
Oh, well you have to watch a 3D showcase to find out then, huh?

00:13:38.213 --> 00:13:38.493
Yeah!

00:13:41.335 --> 00:13:43.578
BAU BAU!

00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:44.459
BAU BAU!

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:49.124
There was a lot of surprising things that happened in our 3D debut.

00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:51.446
But our first song!

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:53.909
Did you see the end?

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.910
Oh, the end?

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.370
Yeah.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.672
Our end card.

00:13:57.152 --> 00:13:57.653
Yeah.

00:13:58.414 --> 00:13:58.714
Yeah.

00:13:58.734 --> 00:13:59.735
You know what, right?

00:14:01.117 --> 00:14:02.017
All I'm feeling...

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.518
I'm a gem for you too.

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:15.280
But the very first song we sung, well, it was our original introduction song, Lifetime Showtime!

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.521
Yeah, but a little bit different from our usual.

00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:25.723
The first time, we sung the full version of Lifetime Showtime!

00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:27.323
We surprised Ruffians!

00:14:27.904 --> 00:14:29.504
Yeah, the full version.

00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:31.385
Yeah, all of a sudden it continues!

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:39.828
Yeah, you know, finally we're able to share the full version with you!

00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:45.370
We're just so happy to be able to unveil it during our 3D debut!

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:52.193
Especially because it's a song that's grown together with us over the past year, ever since we debuted.

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:56.415
And, well, it's written by Suopatora Onesa!

00:14:56.435 --> 00:14:59.938
She's a very, very popular Vtuber!

00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:01.699
She's amazing!

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:03.960
So talented at everything!

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:04.781
Yeah!

00:15:05.221 --> 00:15:08.523
And she puts so many special things into, you know, Moco-chan!

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:09.524
Yeah!

00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:10.724
Today!

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:16.948
You know, you sneeze so much, and just all our feelings are so, so far!

00:15:16.968 --> 00:15:18.449
And so much more!

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:20.491
That's exactly what we wanted, you know!

00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:29.377
When we both have a favorite part, a favorite lyric from, you know, it's a... Bring your smile, bring your shine.

00:15:29.437 --> 00:15:32.018
We'll protect you, won't forget our pledge to you.

00:15:32.038 --> 00:15:39.984
That point, you know, because every time we sing it, you know, we really, really mean it, Ruffians.

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:41.405
From the bottom of our hearts.

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:46.878
You know, Lifetime Showtime, it's a song that's really, really special to us.

00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:55.040
So we want to make sure that when we can finally properly release it to you, that it's done properly and very special.

00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:59.022
So please wait a little longer, okay?

00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:02.203
Just a little longer, hopefully.

00:16:02.803 --> 00:16:04.644
However long is necessary.

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:07.460
Please look forward to the release.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.621
When it happens.

00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:10.702
When it happens, speedy TBA.

00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:12.843
We're looking forward to it.

00:16:12.863 --> 00:16:17.026
So... BAU BAU!

00:16:17.746 --> 00:16:18.367
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:19.407
You've waited a year!

00:16:19.427 --> 00:16:20.488
You can't wait forever!

00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:21.088
I know!

00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:23.129
I feel like that too!

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.530
Why?

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.591
Wait longer, please.

00:16:26.531 --> 00:16:29.572
Moco-chan said please, so... Yeah, I said please, okay?

00:16:30.132 --> 00:16:32.553
I said please, that's the magic word, so now you have to.

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:33.634
Yeah, you have to.

00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:34.374
She said please.

00:16:35.254 --> 00:16:35.734
Got it!

00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:37.235
Furitsuke no Kawaii Kata!

00:16:37.255 --> 00:16:39.516
Thank you!

00:16:39.556 --> 00:16:40.056
Thank you!

00:16:40.096 --> 00:16:43.517
The choreography was done by Sakakibara Yuu-sensei!

00:16:43.657 --> 00:16:45.018
Yuu-sensei!

00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:46.018
Yeah!

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:49.399
And she's a really famous singer, seiyuu!

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.500
And she also does dance and choreography too!

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.301
But you might know her from like the

00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:55.722
Steins Gate ending theme.

00:16:55.742 --> 00:16:56.302
Yeah.

00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:56.783
Chaos Cat.

00:16:56.803 --> 00:16:58.524
There's lots and lots of them.

00:16:58.624 --> 00:17:03.067
She has so many different roles and we really admire her so we're gonna shout it out!

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:04.508
Definitely have a lot of performances.

00:17:04.528 --> 00:17:05.789
Definitely don't have a signature.

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:06.709
Definitely, definitely.

00:17:06.729 --> 00:17:10.472
Yeah, so we're really happy.

00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:16.216
Please take another listen, maybe watch over a performance on Lifetime Showtime.

00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:17.437
Okay, Ruffians?

00:17:18.397 --> 00:17:20.279
Bye bye!

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.540
Not just singing and dancing, no.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.202
And not just beating a Pero.

00:17:24.222 --> 00:17:29.225
We also mentioned that we did pro wrestling!

00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:31.767
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:17:31.787 --> 00:17:32.007
I won!

00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:32.288
Yes!

00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:34.790
Moco-chan, you had to pick this moment!

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.030
Yes.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:36.270
Hi!

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.691
Victory pose!

00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:38.511
Yeah!

00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:43.352
Yeah, but I think we probably surprised you the most with the pro wrestling, right, Ruffians?

00:17:43.512 --> 00:17:43.892
Yeah?

00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:44.652
Yeah.

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:47.933
You know, we had a 3D after party.

00:17:48.253 --> 00:17:51.254
We talked a bunch about everything, especially at pro wrestling.

00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:52.094
In detail.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:55.135
Yeah, so if you're really curious, please go check that out.

00:17:55.515 --> 00:18:00.856
But we are both really happy to be able to fight it out over that one donut!

00:18:00.916 --> 00:18:04.097
Yeah, and it's all thanks to DDT Pro Wrestling's help.

00:18:05.897 --> 00:18:06.357
Yeah.

00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:08.378
And they're guidance that we're able to do it.

00:18:08.718 --> 00:18:09.179
Yeah.

00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:14.881
You know, I think a lot of Ruffians are saying like, oh, I can see Fuwamoco.

00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:16.302
They've done this a lot.

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:17.622
They're professionals.

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:18.803
No.

00:18:19.392 --> 00:18:19.972
Not at all!

00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:20.892
Not at all!

00:18:20.932 --> 00:18:22.373
We're complete beginners of K!

00:18:22.493 --> 00:18:23.093
Yeah!

00:18:23.113 --> 00:18:23.873
I know!

00:18:24.093 --> 00:18:29.315
Even like, from, even just wrestling together, but even just when it comes to pro wrestling, yeah!

00:18:29.355 --> 00:18:30.555
We're beginners!

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:32.996
Yeah, we really admire pro wrestlers.

00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:33.376
Yeah!

00:18:33.396 --> 00:18:35.516
We think they're really cool, just like idols too!

00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:41.398
Yeah, I feel like- They're just a little bit bigger, and more like BAU BAU, rather than BAU BAU!

00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:42.058
Yeah.

00:18:42.078 --> 00:18:47.280
Believe in someone who really respected them beforehand, but of course we have a newfound respect too!

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:47.900
Yeah!

00:18:49.182 --> 00:18:52.665
We trained really, really hard to be able to do it!

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:57.830
And our sensei was super, super, super kind!

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.714
But it was a really, really hard schedule, you know, to be able to do everything.

00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:12.863
You know, we had our streams, recordings, meetings and homework, dance practice, wrestling practice, team practice.

00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:15.465
Yeah, some days it would be like,

00:19:16.481 --> 00:19:17.181
Stream.

00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:18.342
Meeting.

00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:19.223
Homework.

00:19:20.403 --> 00:19:20.963
Wrestling.

00:19:21.004 --> 00:19:21.484
Dancing.

00:19:21.964 --> 00:19:22.784
Recording.

00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:23.045
Yeah.

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:27.667
Some days it'll just be all of them all together, right?

00:19:27.827 --> 00:19:31.469
It was a lot!

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.130
Just a bit busy!

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.812
Yeah, but we're glad we're busy!

00:19:35.832 --> 00:19:38.513
We really like seeing us at each other's throats!

00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:39.294
Yeah!

00:19:39.334 --> 00:19:39.674
Yeah!

00:19:39.774 --> 00:19:41.575
And you know the great Okan!

00:19:41.895 --> 00:19:42.255
Yeah!

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:45.297
A really famous Japanese wrestler that he was hololive at!

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:48.719
Was watching and cheering us on on Twitter.

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:50.339
We're so happy!

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:52.100
Yeah!

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.403
The Great Okazaki even won a big match today as well!

00:19:56.623 --> 00:19:57.943
CRU Shoumedetou!

00:19:58.224 --> 00:20:03.486
Did you like it, Ruffians?

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:08.049
Would you like to see hololive Wrestling with our senpai someday?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.490
hololive Wrestling!

00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:13.107
Yes!

00:20:13.488 --> 00:20:13.868
Yes!

00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.089
Yeah!

00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:23.276
Well, if you want that to happen, you're gonna need to be extra loud because... The staff.

00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:25.358
The 3D team.

00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:30.282
They almost died trying to make this happen, you know?

00:20:30.302 --> 00:20:31.463
Yeah.

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:33.985
But nothing's impossible, right?

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.787
Right, Ruffians?

00:20:36.758 --> 00:20:40.441
So you're gonna need to be extra loud if you want to do more wrestling.

00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:41.122
Yeah!

00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:42.543
Extra, extra loud.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:43.584
Yeah.

00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:45.906
For a 3D team.

00:20:45.926 --> 00:20:50.230
Yeah, they're experienced now.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:51.171
Yes.

00:20:52.612 --> 00:20:55.555
But... Does that make things better?

00:20:58.037 --> 00:20:59.619
hololive Summer!

00:20:59.679 --> 00:20:59.779
Ah!

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.320
hololive Summer Wrestling!

00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:04.730
Resting in bathing water.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.932
Is that what you want?

00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:07.915
Oh my gosh!

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:09.158
Oh my gosh!

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:12.504
Lunch is what you want.

00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:12.584
Wow.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:18.144
And then afterwards, I'm a chihuahua!

00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:20.427
I'm disappointed in you, Ruffians!

00:21:20.607 --> 00:21:28.255
You're gonna need to be extra loud, okay, Ruffians!

00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:28.855
Hi!

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:31.017
Yeah, summer beach wrestling, right?

00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:32.539
I saw with mud.

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:33.140
With mud?

00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:37.372
Idols.

00:21:37.392 --> 00:21:39.133
We're idols, Ruffians!

00:21:39.873 --> 00:21:42.074
There's nothing to do with idols and mud.

00:21:43.294 --> 00:21:43.454
No.

00:21:43.475 --> 00:21:44.695
Don't misunderstand, okay?

00:21:44.715 --> 00:21:45.155
BAU BAU!

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:48.136
BAU BAU!

00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:54.469
Speaking of misunderstandings... Obvious.

00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:58.711
This has been a pretty big misunderstanding, okay?

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:04.874
It's been such a while since we had a misunderstanding, but this is a big misunderstanding!

00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:07.356
That was a lot of desk slams, right?

00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:08.096
Yeah.

00:22:08.136 --> 00:22:08.697
Obvious.

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:14.500
You know, I'm sure there were a lot of things in our 3D debut that made you overload, you know?

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.340
FUWAMOCO.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.961
They're fluffy and fuzzy.

00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:20.523
But... But... You know!

00:22:22.707 --> 00:22:23.688
What you were seeing.

00:22:24.648 --> 00:22:26.369
Especially during the wrestling!

00:22:26.389 --> 00:22:26.970
Yeah.

00:22:29.572 --> 00:22:30.852
It wasn't underwear.

00:22:31.353 --> 00:22:31.973
OK!

00:22:32.573 --> 00:22:32.814
Yeah.

00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:34.355
White shima-shima shorts!

00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.116
Shima-shima shorts, yeah.

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:40.579
Just, you know, blue and white, and pink and white striped shorts.

00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:40.939
Yeah.

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:41.920
Yeah.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.122
No pants!

00:22:45.222 --> 00:22:48.104
So it's nothing to be embarrassed about, right?

00:22:48.244 --> 00:22:49.124
Yeah.

00:22:49.425 --> 00:22:49.725
But it's...

00:22:50.517 --> 00:22:54.278
It's embarrassing when the Ruffians make silly faces like that though.

00:22:54.398 --> 00:22:54.598
Why?

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:54.878
Why?

00:22:54.898 --> 00:22:56.579
Yeah.

00:22:56.599 --> 00:22:57.819
It shouldn't be embarrassing.

00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.679
Don't look too much, okay?

00:22:59.699 --> 00:23:00.640
Ruffians!

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.800
We're not those kind of demon dogs, okay?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.881
We don't show our underwear, okay?

00:23:06.181 --> 00:23:07.881
There's Shima Shima shorts!

00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:09.602
Shima Shima shorts, okay.

00:23:09.642 --> 00:23:09.862
Got it.

00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:13.823
Just ignore the fact that Moco-chan's wearing shorts under her shorts.

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:14.973
Yeah.

00:23:15.154 --> 00:23:15.634
Yeah!

00:23:15.774 --> 00:23:17.437
It's just normal, okay?

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:18.719
So it's another story.

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:20.001
This normal makes sense, yeah.

00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:21.222
No misunderstanding!

00:23:21.383 --> 00:23:22.064
Understood!

00:23:22.204 --> 00:23:22.885
Understood!

00:23:23.005 --> 00:23:23.666
Understood!

00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:24.086
Say it!

00:23:25.283 --> 00:23:26.124
Say understood, Ruffians!

00:23:26.164 --> 00:23:26.844
Say it, Ruffians!

00:23:27.084 --> 00:23:27.825
You understand.

00:23:27.905 --> 00:23:28.705
Shima-shima shorts.

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:29.326
Uh-huh.

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:30.146
Okay.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:32.451
Okay, understood, understood, understood.

00:23:32.552 --> 00:23:34.405
Understood, understood, understood.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.571
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:37.832
Good.

00:23:37.912 --> 00:23:38.893
No misunderstanding.

00:23:38.913 --> 00:23:39.313
Understood.

00:23:39.493 --> 00:23:40.434
Shima-shima shorts.

00:23:40.454 --> 00:23:41.514
Shima-shima shorts.

00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:44.536
Bye-bye!

00:23:44.797 --> 00:23:45.037
Bye-bye!

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:45.237
Yeah.

00:23:45.697 --> 00:23:46.218
Awkward.

00:23:46.518 --> 00:23:46.638
Yeah.

00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:54.269
Well, Ruffians, you know our 3D debut is now done, but we still have our album 3D collab.

00:23:54.369 --> 00:23:56.470
Yeah, don't forget about that, okay?

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:02.851
Also, Breaking Dimension Hall in Ippushu's second concert is gonna be happening very shortly.

00:24:03.031 --> 00:24:05.171
And look at this new key video!

00:24:05.191 --> 00:24:06.272
Look over!

00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:11.033
It came out right before our 3D debut on the official hololive Universe channel.

00:24:13.213 --> 00:24:18.776
I'm ready to break those dimensions!

00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:20.757
Now what is Breaking Dimensions?

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:23.318
Breaking Dimensions is a brand new concert.

00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.639
It's gonna be happening in New York City at the King's Theatre.

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:30.281
Second whole life English concert ever!

00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:33.943
Not just one day, it's two days!

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:37.044
Happening on August 24th and August 25th.

00:24:37.084 --> 00:24:37.464
Thanks to...

00:24:39.285 --> 00:24:40.746
Everyone's excitement too!

00:24:40.786 --> 00:24:42.328
All the tickets are sold out!

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:44.429
But there are streaming tickets!

00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:45.510
Streaming tickets!

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.791
Get your streaming tickets!

00:24:46.831 --> 00:24:48.893
That means you don't need to go to New York!

00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:54.117
You don't need to leave your home to be able to go and join in on the excitement!

00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:59.401
You can get the streaming tickets online from SPWM or e-plus!

00:24:59.881 --> 00:25:03.404
So please make sure you get your streaming tickets!

00:25:03.824 --> 00:25:06.967
Oh they also announced some new merchandise!

00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:08.328
There's a bunch of other things but

00:25:09.078 --> 00:25:09.999
The Krillic Stands.

00:25:10.079 --> 00:25:12.360
I'm most excited about the Krillic Stands!

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.500
Look, look, Ruffians!

00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:16.182
You can put them together in any combination you like!

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:19.224
So like, if you're like, okay, well these are my oshi, I need all my oshi all together.

00:25:19.264 --> 00:25:20.224
Look, look, look, look!

00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:21.225
Oh, it says!

00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:21.785
Right!

00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:23.906
Right, so you can put, you know, like, okay.

00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:27.929
I'm just excited you can have mid-Romance Advent!

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:29.089
Wait, all together?

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:31.711
I was excited about that too, but then it's like... I sort of need it.

00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:33.472
You can put all your oshi together.

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:34.292
I sort of need it.

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:34.472
What?

00:25:34.893 --> 00:25:35.333
But why?

00:25:38.825 --> 00:25:39.109
Yes!

00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:42.712
Yeah, and look what they're all together!

00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:45.054
I just thought, why would you split everyone apart?

00:25:45.074 --> 00:25:46.315
But I guess you could, huh?

00:25:46.455 --> 00:25:46.975
You could.

00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:50.998
You could be a little bit, well... This is just for my own enjoyment.

00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:51.958
Nobody will know.

00:25:51.978 --> 00:25:53.419
I need them all!

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:53.900
Right.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:54.800
Right?

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.541
Such a good idea, right?

00:25:56.561 --> 00:25:56.661
Yeah!

00:25:56.741 --> 00:25:58.122
And it's all so cute!

00:25:58.222 --> 00:25:59.303
Yeah!

00:25:59.343 --> 00:26:01.184
So please make sure you check out those.

00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:04.086
There's also other merch available as well!

00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:04.226
Yeah!

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:07.888
The sales period is from August 10th to September 17th.

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:09.730
So please check that out!

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.790
Oh, okay!

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.571
It's sort of limited.

00:26:11.771 --> 00:26:13.011
Yeah.

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:17.033
But Ruffians, also please make sure that you're ready with your preface!

00:26:17.073 --> 00:26:18.654
Because it's gonna be a concert.

00:26:19.314 --> 00:26:20.395
Never ever forget.

00:26:20.755 --> 00:26:23.036
Advent's first concert too!

00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:25.557
And together it's always so fun!

00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:28.298
Yeah, please meet up with other Ruffians too!

00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:29.399
Have fun together!

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:33.701
And you know, if you're not going to New York, that doesn't mean that you can't meet up with other Ruffians.

00:26:34.021 --> 00:26:34.581
Right, right.

00:26:34.621 --> 00:26:37.583
Maybe there's other Ruffians that are close to where you are!

00:26:37.643 --> 00:26:38.163
Well, I do.

00:26:39.038 --> 00:26:39.979
The power of the internet.

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:41.180
The internet.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.760
Right.

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:47.885
Please look forward to more fun details of coming to Kimo Friends!

00:26:47.985 --> 00:26:48.865
BAU BAU!

00:26:48.945 --> 00:26:53.389
BAU BAU!

00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:56.991
You know, we released our schedule earlier this week.

00:26:57.091 --> 00:26:59.913
But we had something that was a bit mysterious on it, huh?

00:26:59.973 --> 00:27:03.016
Yeah, we're doing a lot of karaoke this week.

00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:05.557
But one of those, the most mysterious one,

00:27:06.418 --> 00:27:08.019
The mystery has been solved!

00:27:08.379 --> 00:27:14.641
We're gonna be doing a karaoke collab together with AZKi-senpai and Akura-senpai!

00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:16.301
BAU BAU!

00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:17.662
We're so so happy!

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:19.843
We're so excited!

00:27:20.143 --> 00:27:25.505
It's gonna be our first time singing with both AZKi-senpai and Akura-senpai!

00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:29.746
And we're so happy because AZKi-senpai invited us!

00:27:30.247 --> 00:27:40.341
And we really wanted to be able to, you know we haven't been able to chat or interact with Aqua-senpai that much, so we are really happy to be able to be a part of this!

00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:40.581
Yeah!

00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:46.670
We figured, you know, she's gonna be very busy and there are lots of other senpai that want to spend time with her, so...

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.111
We're so happy to be included in this!

00:27:50.151 --> 00:27:53.091
So a big thank you to ASCUE-senpai!

00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:55.132
But we're gonna have a bunch of fun!

00:27:55.192 --> 00:28:03.434
It's gonna be really silly, really cute, and we're also gonna sing a lot of nostalgic songs, anime songs!

00:28:03.574 --> 00:28:06.255
It's going to be really fun, so please join us!

00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:10.156
I know FUWAMOCO, we made a little bit of a mistake on our schedule.

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:11.656
Instead of being a, I think,

00:28:12.196 --> 00:28:12.897
5 a.m.

00:28:12.917 --> 00:28:13.017
PT.

00:28:13.197 --> 00:28:14.298
It's one hour later.

00:28:14.438 --> 00:28:16.140
It's one later at 6 a.m.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.901
PT.

00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.203
And it's on AZKi-senpai's channel, okay?

00:28:19.703 --> 00:28:21.265
So please join us.

00:28:21.285 --> 00:28:24.027
It's a little bit early, maybe for some Ruffians.

00:28:24.347 --> 00:28:26.389
But it's gonna be like that, okay?

00:28:26.449 --> 00:28:26.930
Yeah.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.012
Have lots of fun, okay?

00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:29.552
BAU BAU!

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:33.750
I'm so happy!

00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:37.992
One hour later, we made a little bit of a mistake.

00:28:38.772 --> 00:28:46.336
It's gonna be another exciting week with a bunch of different things going on.

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.217
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

00:28:51.298 --> 00:28:56.142
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:28:56.783 --> 00:28:59.005
Happy the Yorkies!

00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:01.107
Wow, that's so tiny!

00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:01.647
So baby!

00:29:01.687 --> 00:29:02.568
Yeah!

00:29:03.028 --> 00:29:04.269
With those little wings!

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.973
Riot, as a demon dog, likes white and blue.

00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:09.134
I approve!

00:29:09.194 --> 00:29:11.496
That's why they're so happy!

00:29:11.536 --> 00:29:12.136
Look at it!

00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:13.037
So small!

00:29:13.097 --> 00:29:14.538
They're very cute!

00:29:14.738 --> 00:29:15.279
Hugging them.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:18.781
IRyS-senpai dakimakura chu!

00:29:18.861 --> 00:29:19.661
It's sort of funny.

00:29:20.082 --> 00:29:20.782
Good taste!

00:29:21.242 --> 00:29:22.263
More funny!

00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:23.283
It's sort of funny.

00:29:24.664 --> 00:29:25.144
Okay.

00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:27.526
Hugging IRyS-senpai.

00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:28.126
Oh no!

00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:29.627
Mocho!

00:29:29.927 --> 00:29:30.967
Mocho happy!

00:29:31.368 --> 00:29:34.189
IRyS-senpai's gonna take you for a osampo!

00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:34.669
What?

00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:35.110
Yeah.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.812
How does... How does... Happy BAU BAU?

00:29:39.852 --> 00:29:40.773
Not IRyS-senpai.

00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:42.073
How does IRyS-senpai BAU BAU?

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:44.215
How does... Happy BAU BAU?

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:44.735
Maybe like...

00:29:45.902 --> 00:29:46.363
BAU BAU!

00:29:49.626 --> 00:29:51.334
It sounds like a morse code, no?

00:29:57.616 --> 00:30:12.688
BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU-BAU

00:30:29.204 --> 00:30:30.065
Ruffians.

00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:33.908
There's a lot of exciting things, but of course you went out for a walk, right?

00:30:33.928 --> 00:30:34.848
Yeah, right!

00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:36.850
Let's see where you went for a walk.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:43.375
Today's I went on a walk is... Da-den!

00:30:43.615 --> 00:30:50.740
Oh, thank you for getting Icomochi-mama's books at Comiket!

00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:54.203
It sounds like it was a really amazing at Comiket.

00:30:54.343 --> 00:30:55.264
We're doing our 3D debut!

00:30:55.304 --> 00:30:55.504
Yeah!

00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:58.586
You know, we were really busy with our debut!

00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:02.389
But we were still super readable everyone there.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.491
It was very very hot!

00:31:04.551 --> 00:31:05.312
Very dangerous!

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:06.132
Crazy hot!

00:31:06.493 --> 00:31:10.636
Yeah, but we're glad that you're safe and that you got your treasures too!

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:22.491
Thank you so much to all the Ruffians who went to Icomochi-mama's books, and you know, especially also to all the Ruffians who released the books, and we read so much too!

00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:26.295
We read there was a lot of circles in FUWAMOCO books this year!

00:31:26.335 --> 00:31:26.916
Yeah!

00:31:27.737 --> 00:31:28.797
We're really happy!

00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:35.839
You know, because one of our big goals is to get FUWAMOCO doujinshi, get a person down.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:40.900
So we're really happy that you're making lots and lots of works of art.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.341
And we hope you know that maybe there are even more doing next week's weekend!

00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:48.562
BAU BAU!

00:31:49.462 --> 00:31:51.302
We're excited!

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:52.562
BAU BAU!

00:31:52.622 --> 00:31:54.043
BAU BAU!

00:31:57.485 --> 00:31:59.587
I'm just imagining Winter Comiket now.

00:31:59.687 --> 00:32:00.308
I'm excited.

00:32:00.808 --> 00:32:02.109
Summer Comiket is hot.

00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:04.331
But Winter Comiket is cold.

00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:05.852
Yeah.

00:32:05.912 --> 00:32:08.674
Did we get a question on the day, Moco-chan?

00:32:08.694 --> 00:32:12.857
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:14.559
Watching Futajiri.

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:16.180
That's a new anime.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.801
Futajiri.

00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:19.743
Love is not inter... visible?

00:32:20.003 --> 00:32:20.604
By twins.

00:32:20.644 --> 00:32:21.284
By twins.

00:32:21.684 --> 00:32:21.945
Yeah.

00:32:22.225 --> 00:32:24.026
Made me curious about your teenage years.

00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:29.330
You told us that you always got along and your fights were always quickly resolved.

00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:33.494
But did you go through any rebellious phases related to being twins?

00:32:33.854 --> 00:32:37.237
Like questioning your role as older or younger sister?

00:32:37.397 --> 00:32:37.978
Inoue!

00:32:38.538 --> 00:32:40.199
We're 2000 plus years old now.

00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:40.439
Bye.

00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:47.233
It's been a while since then, hi.

00:32:47.353 --> 00:32:48.514
But... No.

00:32:48.974 --> 00:32:49.334
No.

00:32:49.394 --> 00:32:51.156
No rebellious faces ever.

00:32:51.476 --> 00:32:51.776
Yeah.

00:32:51.816 --> 00:32:53.197
Mama Puppy!

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:56.199
No, she always says that we're very well-behaved.

00:32:56.379 --> 00:32:56.820
Yeah.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.361
I guess in tour.

00:32:59.488 --> 00:33:06.532
Demon guide dog training and then we kinda got a bit distracted and did some mischief and... You know what?

00:33:06.712 --> 00:33:07.092
It's fine.

00:33:07.132 --> 00:33:07.652
It was good.

00:33:07.672 --> 00:33:08.973
We didn't do anything wrong.

00:33:08.993 --> 00:33:09.073
Yeah.

00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:09.753
Yeah.

00:33:09.973 --> 00:33:12.214
You know, just having some fun.

00:33:12.295 --> 00:33:12.415
Yeah!

00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:13.655
It's good.

00:33:13.775 --> 00:33:16.477
But, yeah, you know, I'm the older sister.

00:33:16.797 --> 00:33:18.378
You know, and I'm the younger sister.

00:33:18.398 --> 00:33:20.179
Yeah, but we're still twins.

00:33:21.139 --> 00:33:21.659
No fights.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.040
No questioning.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.161
Just all around good and the same.

00:33:25.181 --> 00:33:25.641
Yup.

00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:26.542
No phases.

00:33:26.902 --> 00:33:27.162
No.

00:33:27.462 --> 00:33:28.603
Nothing that interesting.

00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:29.713
Yeah.

00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:30.694
What?

00:33:31.054 --> 00:33:34.456
Are you disappointed, Ruffy?

00:33:34.476 --> 00:33:34.516
Aw.

00:33:35.436 --> 00:33:35.597
Aw.

00:33:35.657 --> 00:33:36.217
Yeah.

00:33:36.237 --> 00:33:38.338
Shiori no fights!

00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:43.501
Well, you know, we kinda had a bit of a squabble over the donut.

00:33:43.561 --> 00:33:44.702
Yeah, I think.

00:33:44.742 --> 00:33:48.865
Because we were both sitting on the sofa.

00:33:49.705 --> 00:33:52.587
We had a big squabble about the placement on the sofa.

00:33:54.693 --> 00:33:57.994
Whether it should be an inch over this way or an inch over that way.

00:33:58.354 --> 00:34:04.376
In the end it doesn't matter because the sofa kinda moves around a little bit.

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:05.236
Yeah.

00:34:07.017 --> 00:34:07.277
Yeah.

00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.877
It doesn't really matter in the end.

00:34:08.977 --> 00:34:09.357
No.

00:34:09.578 --> 00:34:10.018
Yeah.

00:34:11.038 --> 00:34:11.178
Ugh.

00:34:11.378 --> 00:34:12.178
No wrestling!

00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:13.679
Not on a normal basis!

00:34:13.799 --> 00:34:14.419
No!

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:15.559
Yeah.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.500
Solve it with wrestling again!

00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:23.942
Well, unless we have a very good reason.

00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:24.142
Yeah.

00:34:25.456 --> 00:34:26.777
Donuts are a good reason.

00:34:26.857 --> 00:34:27.197
Exactly.

00:34:27.217 --> 00:34:29.079
The last pon-de-ring is a good reason.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:29.739
Uh huh.

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:29.959
Yeah.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.000
BAU BAU!

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.581
Thank you!

00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:33.862
Thank you!

00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:34.903
Please let us know.

00:34:35.003 --> 00:34:36.904
I'm sure you have more questions, right?

00:34:36.964 --> 00:34:39.686
Especially with our 3D debut and everything.

00:34:39.706 --> 00:34:40.767
So please ask us.

00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:41.908
You can use the hashtag.

00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:44.490
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.710
Also your walks.

00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:49.833
There's been some very beautiful walks that the Ruffians have been going on.

00:34:49.853 --> 00:34:52.735
Please show us where you're going, okay?

00:34:52.816 --> 00:34:53.976
And with your peril sightings.

00:34:54.036 --> 00:34:54.537
I'm sure that

00:34:54.997 --> 00:34:58.718
Pero's probably gonna be going around to a bunch of different places.

00:34:59.058 --> 00:35:02.479
So please let us know, Ruffians, what kind of places you see him in.

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:04.380
We have no clue where he went, hon.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.700
Yeah, also Doggie of the Day.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.221
I'm sure there's a lot of doggies out there playing, having a lot of fun, summer fun.

00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.882
Yes, I would like to be the Doggie of the Day, hon!

00:35:12.942 --> 00:35:14.862
Please let us know with the hashtag.

00:35:15.322 --> 00:35:17.643
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:35:17.983 --> 00:35:20.844
BAU BAU!

00:35:21.384 --> 00:35:22.905
Our next stream.

00:35:23.385 --> 00:35:24.385
We have the

00:35:25.877 --> 00:35:30.783
For our Doggy Pack, we're gonna be watching The Princess Bride.

00:35:31.324 --> 00:35:32.826
It's our first time watching it.

00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:34.348
I have no clue what it's about.

00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:36.731
The princesses become brides.

00:35:38.049 --> 00:35:39.870
The movie's over.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:44.031
You wanted to watch it, Doggy Pack, so... Go watch it!

00:35:44.331 --> 00:35:44.731
Yeah!

00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:47.592
It's a little bit earlier than usual!

00:35:47.652 --> 00:35:48.052
Yeah!

00:35:48.092 --> 00:35:50.193
So please make sure that you don't... Oh!

00:35:50.653 --> 00:35:51.393
I made a mistake!

00:35:51.433 --> 00:35:53.094
Now it's over!

00:35:53.274 --> 00:35:55.355
Two hours late!

00:35:55.435 --> 00:35:55.635
So...

00:35:56.175 --> 00:35:57.175
Please join us, okay?

00:35:57.215 --> 00:35:58.656
It's gonna be at 4 p.m.

00:35:58.996 --> 00:36:00.076
PT.

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:01.517
BAU BAU!

00:36:02.217 --> 00:36:03.397
Our schedule, you know!

00:36:03.557 --> 00:36:03.777
Yes!

00:36:04.377 --> 00:36:09.339
So we have our karaoke with AZKi-senpai and Aqua-senpai at 5 a.m.

00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:10.059
PT.

00:36:10.479 --> 00:36:12.219
I made a mistake.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:12.580
5 a.m.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:12.720
PT.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.761
It's one hour later than what we have on the schedule because we made a mistake.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.001
We made a mistake.

00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:22.002
So it's really just three hours earlier than FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:36:22.082 --> 00:36:22.382
Yeah.

00:36:22.422 --> 00:36:24.223
Just a bit of an earlier morning, right?

00:36:24.243 --> 00:36:24.843
An earlier morning.

00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:29.436
And then we have Sakura with Five again!

00:36:29.757 --> 00:36:31.599
And Wednesday with FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.265
Followed by an off-collab karaoke with Biboo!

00:36:35.745 --> 00:36:35.966
Yeah!

00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:37.288
We're gonna have fun!

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:39.230
Diamond dogs and Saimei dogs.

00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:40.653
We're really excited!

00:36:40.973 --> 00:36:42.033
Excited!

00:36:42.314 --> 00:36:45.215
And Thursday's gonna be a bit of a homework day for us.

00:36:45.275 --> 00:36:46.055
Wish us luck.

00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:50.877
But Friday, we have a main cafe, Totsumachi Main Cafe call.

00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:54.239
It's what we're gonna be doing very early at 6AM PT.

00:36:54.319 --> 00:36:57.601
And this part of the whole summer bingo.

00:36:57.621 --> 00:36:59.942
I wonder which senpai will call us.

00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:04.645
Otherwise, you know, maybe we'll just have to serve the Ruffians.

00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:07.708
Oh, we were like that all, huh?

00:37:07.968 --> 00:37:10.390
Yeah, and then we have another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:15.154
And after that, we have a FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:37:17.275 --> 00:37:20.458
Somehow they always end up to be on the Fridays recently.

00:37:20.558 --> 00:37:24.861
But this time, our theme is hololive ONLY songs!

00:37:27.483 --> 00:37:30.465
In our Breaking Dimensions, we made our 3D debut.

00:37:30.845 --> 00:37:33.627
It's time that we sing some hololive songs.

00:37:33.927 --> 00:37:35.328
It's been a while.

00:37:35.348 --> 00:37:36.649
So we hope you'll join us.

00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.891
We're gonna sing a bunch of our senpai songs.

00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:41.733
Or maybe some other new ones as well.

00:37:42.972 --> 00:37:44.133
BAU BAU!

00:37:44.213 --> 00:37:47.674
And then, it's the  3D debut collab!

00:37:47.774 --> 00:37:50.635
Happening on Saturdays at Misabot- Misabot?

00:37:50.655 --> 00:37:51.416
Miss it!

00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:54.197
Saturday at 8pm PT!

00:37:54.697 --> 00:37:57.498
I feel like a lot of Ruffians are forgetting about it.

00:37:57.578 --> 00:37:57.819
Why?

00:37:57.859 --> 00:38:01.060
There's been so many exciting things that maybe you might be like, oh, that's it.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:01.960
No!

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.041
It's not over!

00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:04.441
It's continuing!

00:38:04.662 --> 00:38:08.063
Yeah, all five of us, all of  will be together!

00:38:08.183 --> 00:38:09.644
And it's gonna be silly.

00:38:10.044 --> 00:38:10.124
Yeah.

00:38:10.144 --> 00:38:12.245
Cause it's pretty silly when we're all together.

00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:16.900
And then after that, it's a very busy day for us.

00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.083
We're off to sell popcorn!

00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:22.046
And we're gonna be doing a Rock n' Rawr Party mini.

00:38:22.306 --> 00:38:24.188
Followed by a meet and greet!

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:27.011
So if you're a Ruffian, you're in for it!

00:38:27.792 --> 00:38:29.433
See you there!

00:38:29.553 --> 00:38:36.937
And then on Sunday early morning at 3AM CTM, we're gonna be doing an off-clock with Haachama-senpai!

00:38:37.037 --> 00:38:40.479
Playing a very scary game, Horoku-kun.

00:38:40.799 --> 00:38:42.520
We played it, it was very scary.

00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:45.982
We're gonna start from the beginning again, cause we didn't get very far, huh?

00:38:46.062 --> 00:38:52.546
Yeah, and it's gonna be Haachama-senpai's first time playing it, and I'm pretty sure she'll help us a lot right now.

00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.166
Yeah, right?

00:38:54.507 --> 00:38:55.548
That's the whole point, right?

00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:59.483
Well, as high as I'm a senpai, you never know.

00:39:02.044 --> 00:39:03.764
And then at 6 p.m.

00:39:03.784 --> 00:39:09.406
PT, we're gonna be playing Aqua-senpai's visual novel, Aquarium!

00:39:10.126 --> 00:39:12.126
You know, FUWAMOCO, we love visual novels.

00:39:12.146 --> 00:39:14.247
It's our dream to have our own visual novel.

00:39:14.267 --> 00:39:17.588
So we're gonna play Aqua-senpai's visual novel.

00:39:17.608 --> 00:39:20.469
And maybe we can take some notes, learn a few things.

00:39:21.129 --> 00:39:21.649
Yeah.
