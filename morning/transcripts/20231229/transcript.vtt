04:58.756 --> 05:02.839
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:07.982 --> 05:12.384
Good morning, motherfluffers!

05:15.366 --> 05:18.368
Another beautiful day is upon us!

05:19.849 --> 05:22.711
Are there any sleepyheads out there?

05:25.185 --> 05:25.885
Hi!

05:25.905 --> 05:27.166
You there!

05:27.206 --> 05:30.188
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

05:30.248 --> 05:33.049
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:35.430 --> 05:36.251
Are you awake yet?

05:37.491 --> 05:40.793
Wipe those crusty eyes and let's get going!

05:41.173 --> 05:44.655
Because an AsaMoco Live is about to begin!

05:45.695 --> 05:48.497
Just what kind of news stories are waiting for us today?

05:49.777 --> 05:50.458
Let's take a look.

05:54.236 --> 06:01.460
Well, back behind my head here being all noisy, we have our live spectators and commenters!

06:02.241 --> 06:05.142
Good morning, live spectator commenters!

06:05.783 --> 06:06.623
Good morning!

06:09.565 --> 06:10.205
It's you, yes!

06:10.285 --> 06:11.066
It's you, yes!

06:11.926 --> 06:12.947
Oh, natsukashii!

06:13.827 --> 06:15.248
Oh, BAU BAU!

06:15.748 --> 06:17.069
Oh my gosh!

06:18.129 --> 06:18.910
Oh my gosh!

06:21.403 --> 06:27.106
Yes, well, we have lots of lovely commenters from our lovely commentators.

06:29.207 --> 06:31.248
Well, my gosh.

06:31.828 --> 06:34.589
We do have some breaking news.

06:37.331 --> 06:37.531
Well.

06:39.864 --> 06:43.225
There has been a terror in the community recently.

06:44.166 --> 06:51.488
A spherical yet strangely festive white mass has been reported breaking into homes and assaulting individuals.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.169
Have you seen anyone like this?

06:55.630 --> 06:57.770
This nasty criminal?

06:59.851 --> 07:03.292
Well, if you have, I'm sorry.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.394
The details are

07:07.975 --> 07:20.260
Rather graphic, but after some big sloppy doggy kisses from the intruder, there are reports of the victims hallucinating and seeing a white Christmas.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.322
There was a high uptick in cases that occurred on Christmas Eve as well.

07:25.342 --> 07:29.703
According to our resident expert, F,

07:33.820 --> 07:36.341
This style of breaking entry is very, very rude.

07:37.141 --> 07:38.181
It's very heinous.

07:38.521 --> 07:50.885
It does not follow the proper rules and regulations that one should be mindful of when performing such an ancient Japanese tradition, such as some that begin with a yo.

07:52.105 --> 08:01.187
There must be pure emotions and empathy behind it, and there must be beauty, but there is no love in this heart of the criminal.

08:06.338 --> 08:07.800
What are you talking about, Expert F?

08:09.942 --> 08:13.585
Maybe Expert F isn't as much of an expert as we thought, huh?

08:14.886 --> 08:15.387
Wow!

08:16.248 --> 08:19.270
What do I spectator commenters have to say here, huh?

08:19.291 --> 08:22.694
A fluffy expert.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.535
Are we sure this is an expert?

08:26.617 --> 08:29.180
Maybe just a very fluffy mind.

08:31.035 --> 08:32.756
Kusa.

08:33.437 --> 08:33.997
Guilty.

08:34.478 --> 08:35.318
Very scared.

08:36.479 --> 08:40.883
Please make sure to be very safe from the Spherical Intruder, okay Ruffians?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.684
BAU BAU!

08:44.526 --> 08:48.909
Well, there is some sad news to share with you today.

08:50.971 --> 08:53.133
YouTube has been grumpy and rough

08:54.232 --> 08:54.452
Ms.

08:54.512 --> 08:56.393
Fuwawa Abyssgard and Ms.

08:56.473 --> 09:03.116
Mococo Abyssgard of FUWAMOCO Channel on YouTube have had their first major run-in with the platform.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.097
There is some unfair punishment going on.

09:07.537 --> 09:16.101
After doing a very lovely, very beautiful visual novel style Christmas Eve stream, YouTube has been funny.

09:17.061 --> 09:21.523
And well, it noticed some of the

09:23.433 --> 09:24.073
Exciting.

09:24.614 --> 09:27.536
Game-like event CG sprinkled through the stream.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.339
Well, it was very, very exciting for the Ruffians.

09:33.920 --> 09:44.567
That excitement also has reached YouTube as well and now they feel like it's not suitable for advertisers and have limited the ads on the video.

09:45.527 --> 09:46.148
YouTube!

09:46.168 --> 09:47.569
What are you doing?

09:47.629 --> 09:47.749
Hi!

09:50.228 --> 09:57.653
Well, according to the expert elf, this is something deeply ingrained in what makes YouTube YouTube.

09:58.393 --> 10:07.279
You could say maybe that this is just a part of YouTube's animalistic instincts, but it's still horrible.

10:07.299 --> 10:13.584
You know, YouTube helps make smiles, but it can also easily take them away.

10:14.542 --> 10:21.090
Good thing there are some Demon Guard Dog sisters out there to protect your smile, huh?

10:23.132 --> 10:24.574
You might win this one today, YouTube.

10:25.054 --> 10:26.456
But not forever!

10:26.936 --> 10:28.338
BAU BAU!

10:29.579 --> 10:31.101
Moving on to our next story.

10:32.162 --> 10:33.284
The bad news continues.

10:36.155 --> 10:41.177
The archiver of hololive English -Advent-, Shiori Novella, has fallen.

10:41.977 --> 10:48.540
She just released her first cover song ever of Whisper Whisper Whisper by Azari, which is super exciting!

10:49.120 --> 10:52.041
In fact, it's super duper exciting!

10:52.561 --> 10:54.162
It's her first song cover!

10:54.602 --> 10:55.722
BAU BAU BAU!

10:56.043 --> 10:56.523
Right!

10:57.963 --> 10:58.984
It's time to celebrate!

10:59.824 --> 11:00.184
Hai!

11:01.545 --> 11:02.045
But, uh...

11:03.098 --> 11:08.361
Shiori's release method was also very unique.

11:08.541 --> 11:15.705
So unique that when there were reports of it coming in, it seemed like we were two weeks late to the party!

11:16.906 --> 11:19.107
But no, that wasn't the truth!

11:20.508 --> 11:21.609
We contacted Ms.

11:22.009 --> 11:30.874
Shiori Novella for a comment on the matter, and she told us that it was the fault of a mysterious Kuroi Novella!

11:32.898 --> 11:36.681
This Kuroi Novella character likes the darkness of a silent room.

11:37.222 --> 11:46.570
And so, when they're clicking around YouTube in the darkness, they accidentally set the video from private to public.

11:48.271 --> 11:50.053
What a mysterious figure.

11:51.114 --> 11:56.659
Well, we can thank them for the accidental gift of Shiori's first cover song!

11:57.239 --> 11:57.640
But you know,

11:59.059 --> 12:02.860
We would've liked to celebrate the release together with Shiori and all the noveletes.

12:04.141 --> 12:04.821
Good you!

12:04.841 --> 12:06.662
Good eye novella!

12:08.382 --> 12:12.364
Well, what do our spectator commenters have to say here, huh?

12:13.524 --> 12:13.824
Whoops.

12:14.704 --> 12:15.525
Whoops is right.

12:16.965 --> 12:17.645
She's the leader.

12:17.665 --> 12:18.626
She is the leader.

12:20.363 --> 12:22.985
Kuroi Novella, who is this woman?

12:23.305 --> 12:23.765
Kusat.

12:24.065 --> 12:24.505
Funny.

12:24.545 --> 12:25.186
Mysterious.

12:25.666 --> 12:26.406
It's all of that.

12:28.508 --> 12:32.670
Well, let's check out Shiori's cover and cheer her on, okay?

12:34.511 --> 12:36.092
Continuing our news.

12:38.373 --> 12:46.037
There has been some recent suspicions arise around FUWAMOCO and their song choices when it comes to Japanese music.

12:47.611 --> 13:02.421
When examining this tweet and question here, we can conclude that this Ruffian is wondering if maybe FUWAMOCO's maine-chan is making some heavy-handed suggestions and telling FUWAMOCO to sing some pretty interesting classic choices.

13:02.441 --> 13:15.109
You know, with logic that would make sense considering time and age and upbringing heavily influences these sort of things, but there's one big question here.

13:18.186 --> 13:22.888
It's suggesting what content talents make something and Mane-chan do it.

13:24.989 --> 13:30.751
Well, the answer is, for FUWAMOCO, NO!

13:31.731 --> 13:36.673
Mane-chan is there to support their crazy thoughts and ideas.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.174
I wonder when that happens, huh?

13:39.214 --> 13:42.055
Crazy thoughts and ideas never happen, huh?

13:42.776 --> 13:48.800
So, even if you ask Mane-chan what they think, they'll just say, do what you think is best!

13:49.320 --> 13:50.121
As long as it's okay.

13:52.282 --> 13:52.803
But no!

13:53.143 --> 14:01.709
Not even Mane-chan, nor FUWAMOCO's mama puppy, or papa puppy, or grandma puppy, no one can influence their actions!

14:03.070 --> 14:09.854
It's now well documented that FUWAMOCO just have an interesting taste and knowledge when it comes to anime songs and J-pop.

14:10.595 --> 14:10.715
Hm.

14:12.439 --> 14:12.719
Over!

14:16.482 --> 14:22.226
And our next, we have our popular education acquaintance!

14:22.867 --> 14:24.788
Please go have fun!

14:25.589 --> 14:31.794
It's time for Biboo's Japanese Class!

14:31.974 --> 14:33.715
Yay!

14:34.476 --> 14:40.421
Today's Japanese is... Kora!

14:41.542 --> 14:43.342
Nametara akan yo!

14:44.723 --> 14:45.063
Kora!

14:46.043 --> 14:47.923
Nametara akan yo!

14:49.304 --> 14:52.964
It means... Beep off!

14:53.605 --> 14:56.445
Don't underestimate me, you silly head!

14:59.406 --> 15:03.107
Let's all continue having lots of fun learning Japanese together, okay?

15:04.247 --> 15:05.147
Rock, rock!

15:09.166 --> 15:11.147
Oh no, what's the matter Nerissa?

15:11.808 --> 15:16.431
I don't know, it's just that recently I've been struggling making thumbnails for streams.

15:16.992 --> 15:19.033
Like, I don't want to make them anymore.

15:19.053 --> 15:20.814
I just want to have fun.

15:20.834 --> 15:25.878
No more cutting and pasting and playing around with fonts and colors and angles.

15:26.719 --> 15:27.819
Yeah, I gotchu.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.942
If only there was an easy answer to making thumbnails.

15:31.522 --> 15:33.804
Oh, are you two having problems?

15:34.525 --> 15:36.788
Yeah, making thumbnails just suck.

15:37.408 --> 15:41.033
Well, in that case, I have just the product for you two!

15:41.453 --> 15:41.573
Oh?

15:41.773 --> 15:42.414
What is it?

15:43.175 --> 15:48.681
Made from 100% professionally aged demon dog, it's Powdered Pero!

15:49.362 --> 15:51.705
Dried in the musty corners at the bottom of the cell,

15:52.205 --> 16:01.369
If you stir in around 100 grams into a hot cup of Rat King tea, you can blast them making a bunch of master quality thumbnails even Picasso would be proud of!

16:01.769 --> 16:03.610
Wow, that sounds great!

16:03.810 --> 16:04.711
It sure is!

16:05.071 --> 16:06.471
Does it just help with thumbnails?

16:06.692 --> 16:08.192
Yeah, what about side effects?

16:08.572 --> 16:09.133
Huh?

16:09.373 --> 16:12.074
Are you implying something, Nerissa?

16:12.214 --> 16:13.154
No, no, no!

16:13.174 --> 16:15.916
How did Pero is perfectly safe!

16:16.476 --> 16:18.477
It's no different from an energy drink, I think.

16:19.177 --> 16:20.018
I love you two.

16:20.038 --> 16:23.419
Why would I ever try to entice you into something questionable, huh?

16:24.300 --> 16:26.201
As for video editing, you betcha!

16:26.861 --> 16:29.482
You'll be able to make any movie you want in a flash!

16:29.502 --> 16:35.105
Vlogs, animation, feature-length films, animal videos.

16:35.545 --> 16:39.327
It's all possible with just a sip of some tea mixed with powdered Pero!

16:39.347 --> 16:40.748
It tastes great too!

16:41.428 --> 16:48.892
You know when you find an old marshmallow on the sofa and you're like, when in the world did I last have marshmallows, huh?

16:49.573 --> 16:53.055
You know, that's exactly the flavor of powdered Pero.

16:53.595 --> 17:00.259
With a combination of confusion and artificial sweeteners, it only adds to your beverage and enhances your creativity.

17:00.699 --> 17:01.539
Amazing!

17:02.220 --> 17:04.141
And the best part, the price!

17:04.781 --> 17:07.763
All it costs you is... Can you guess?

17:09.164 --> 17:26.853
Well, normally it would be $149.99 with shipping and handling, but due to a manufacturing error totally not caused by a certain employee called Fuwawa Abyssgard, that new price is something that will never be beaten in multiple, multiple lifetimes.

17:28.013 --> 17:32.115
All it takes is hitting the subscribe button!

17:34.517 --> 17:35.759
You thought I'd say your smile?

17:36.781 --> 17:37.242
Well!

17:37.863 --> 17:42.512
Now that you've hit that button right, I'll make an even better deal for you!

17:43.534 --> 17:44.656
All it costs is...

17:45.700 --> 17:46.581
Your smile!

17:46.981 --> 17:48.182
Because I need it.

17:48.823 --> 17:50.324
It's my duty to protect it.

17:51.065 --> 17:51.925
You'll give it to me, right?

17:52.646 --> 17:53.367
Absolutely.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.328
You already had my smile.

17:55.649 --> 17:58.251
Only now can you get your own Powdered Pero!

17:58.771 --> 18:06.118
Limited to 1000 grams per pack, Powdered Pero is available now for the next 100 spectator commenters!

18:06.758 --> 18:10.962
Once today's show ends, it will go back forever in the FUWAMOCO Vault.

18:11.362 --> 18:12.283
BAU BAU!

18:12.403 --> 18:13.124
BAU BAU!

18:16.929 --> 18:17.510
Wow!

18:18.230 --> 18:22.375
That was a very cute and heartwarming Japanese lesson from Biboo!

18:22.955 --> 18:28.901
You know, she'll definitely help us polish up our Japanese skills until they're solid like a rock, huh?

18:29.882 --> 18:32.865
Powdered Pero too!

18:33.866 --> 18:36.509
Sounds like a good rush of creative inspiration!

18:36.549 --> 18:36.850
Wow.

18:38.905 --> 18:41.786
Let's hear what our spectator commenters have to say.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.107
BAU BAU.

18:43.727 --> 18:44.808
BAU BAU!

18:45.168 --> 18:45.748
Indeed!

18:45.988 --> 18:46.609
Need it!

18:46.929 --> 18:48.210
You'll take 20!

18:49.150 --> 18:50.591
Well, you're just in luck!

18:52.632 --> 18:53.652
So authentic!

18:53.752 --> 18:57.434
Yes, Power Pero is only the most authentic!

18:58.975 --> 19:01.936
Well, let's continue on to more news!

19:04.157 --> 19:07.039
Our next story is a very exciting one!

19:08.149 --> 19:13.651
hololive English -Advent- will be revealing their first alternate outfits on January 1st!

19:14.471 --> 19:15.812
New Year's outfits!

19:16.732 --> 19:20.574
And that means it's the season of outfit design guessing.

19:22.254 --> 19:23.615
And despite Ms.

19:23.675 --> 19:35.039
Mococo announcing that the New Year's outfits are as cute as fundoshi, there has been a serious lack of serious outfit guesses featuring fundoshi themselves.

19:37.403 --> 19:40.506
Do you not think there's a hundoshi there hiding Ruffians?

19:43.929 --> 19:50.574
Well, since hundoshi might be new to some Ruffians out there, we ask expert elf for help.

19:55.725 --> 20:08.787
According to Expert F, fundoshi are a traditional Japanese undergarment that consists of a single strip of cloth and leaves a lot of the behind exposed to the airing gaze.

20:10.108 --> 20:10.408
But!

20:10.788 --> 20:13.348
It's an important part of Japanese culture!

20:13.968 --> 20:21.210
It is rather shocking to think that there may be so many who think that a fundoshi may not be included in an outfit design, huh?

20:22.090 --> 20:22.330
Well!

20:23.385 --> 20:28.250
Let's turn to hear what our spectator commentators have to say about this.

20:30.853 --> 20:31.213
Hai.

20:32.374 --> 20:33.475
Interesting.

20:34.476 --> 20:35.137
Culture.

20:35.197 --> 20:35.797
Right.

20:36.518 --> 20:37.039
Kusa.

20:38.941 --> 20:39.141
Oh.

20:39.801 --> 20:40.702
Thank you.

20:40.722 --> 20:40.782
Yes.

20:40.963 --> 20:41.623
Expert Elf.

20:41.743 --> 20:42.945
Thank you very much.

20:45.107 --> 20:46.328
Very important.

BAU BAU!

21:02.734 --> 21:05.276
And here's today's weather report!

21:05.676 --> 21:07.137
Oh.

21:08.038 --> 21:08.458
Gosh.

21:09.378 --> 21:09.979
This world.

21:11.932 --> 21:14.173
It looks strangely nostalgic, huh?

21:15.253 --> 21:18.535
Today's forecast calls for some nostalgic rain showers.

21:25.618 --> 21:32.840
And hopefully, looking forward to even more new and exciting good times to come to us in the future.

21:34.321 --> 21:35.321
Well, everyone!

21:36.162 --> 21:39.283
