## üêæ 400K Ruffians ([06:27](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=06m27s))

FUWAMOCO celebrate and thank Ruffians for reaching 400K subscribers on YouTube, only 4 days after debut!

## üì¢ Starting Voice Packs ([08:12](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=08m12s))

FUWAMOCO remind us that the [Advent Starting Voice Packs](https://shop.hololivepro.com/en/pages/search-results-page?q=starting%20voice%20advent), a set of Japanese and English voices, are on sale.

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([12:03](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=12m03s))

In what would become a recurrent corner, FUWAMOCO steps up once more to clear up a few misunderstandings:

* Mococo apologizes (relunctantly) for the strong words she uttered during Typing of the Dead.
* They clear up that, unlike the picture Crunchyroll put in [their interview about their top 11 anime](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/interviews/2023/8/3/hololives-FUWAMOCO-list-their-favorite-anime), they only watched the first Kemono Friends series, ~~perplexing a few Ruffians as it seems that a second series doesn't exist at all~~.
* Most importantly, the reason Fuwawa finds the word [*yobai* (Â§úÈÄô„ÅÑ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yobai) interesting might be more innocent than what people think.
* They announce there'll be no more misunderstandings from now on. *Surely there won't‚Ä¶*

## üôä Confession ([19:31](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=19m31s))

Mococo confesses that, even if FUWAMOCO said [on their Q&A](https://youtu.be/AL3FAfr8FGc?t=6612) that all their senpai inspire them in its own way, the member she admire the most is actually [Omaru Polka](https://www.youtube.com/@OmaruPolka), and that her original song, ["SAIKYOUTICPOLKA"](https://youtu.be/0bo6MVQxY6Y), makes her cry.

## üê∂ Doggie of the Day ([23:37](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=23m37s))

[YoeUi](https://twitter.com/yoe_ui/status/1686779452108558336) shows us a pic of brave Paco.

## üö∂ Today I Went On A Walk ([25:08](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=25m08s))

[JF Ellie](https://twitter.com/Zeralyos/status/1686887330873749505) took a walk on what it seems a steep yet pleasant trail.

## ‚ùì Question Of The Day ([26:13](https://youtu.be/YILB_0QF-uI?t=26m13s))

[DramaticFailure4U](https://twitter.com/DramaticFail/status/1686579900197556224) wonders if FUWAMOCO have to remove their ears when they go to sleep. They don't: even though the ears are indeed mostly decorative, they aren't removable and have their own uses.
