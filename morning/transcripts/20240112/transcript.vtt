05:14.210 --> 05:16.349
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:16.829 --> 05:20.210
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:20.230 --> 05:22.650
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.690 --> 05:26.011
BAU BAU BAU!

05:26.611 --> 05:29.592
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:29.932 --> 05:32.432
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:32.572 --> 05:35.333
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:35.393 --> 05:37.113
BAU BAU BAU!

05:37.713 --> 05:41.434
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.474 --> 05:42.654
Yeah, just today.

05:44.622 --> 05:45.724
Today!

05:45.864 --> 05:46.145
Huh?

05:48.028 --> 05:50.011
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:50.853 --> 05:55.541
Thank you for joining us for our 67th episode today!

05:55.681 --> 05:56.342
BAU BAU!

05:59.246 --> 06:02.967
Today, today, today, today is FUWAMOCO Morning 67.

06:03.407 --> 06:04.467
Another day.

06:05.367 --> 06:05.987
Another day.

06:06.247 --> 06:09.548
Another FUWAMOCO Morning all together!

06:09.708 --> 06:13.989
Maybe this is your first time joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:15.029 --> 06:24.210
And for your information, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday today, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:24.890 --> 06:26.311
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:26.331 --> 06:27.831
And it's hosted by us,

06:28.451 --> 06:29.952
FUWAMOCO!

06:32.134 --> 06:32.975
FUWAMOCO.

06:33.095 --> 06:34.576
FUWAMOCO.

06:34.596 --> 06:42.562
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:42.962 --> 06:48.046
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:48.186 --> 06:52.289
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:52.749 --> 06:54.771
BAU BAU!

06:56.530 --> 06:58.011
Ruffians, did you BAU BAU there?

06:58.771 --> 07:00.272
I only saw a few BAU BAUs.

07:03.174 --> 07:08.217
BAU BAU.

07:10.599 --> 07:16.822
Unfortunately, there's been another panel sighting.

07:20.224 --> 07:22.145
He keeps on showing up everywhere, huh?

07:22.966 --> 07:24.107
I'm sorry, Ruffians.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.862
Where is it this time, Pero?

07:26.942 --> 07:27.222
Hi.

07:28.283 --> 07:28.703
De-den.

07:34.528 --> 07:40.513
At first, you know, I thought it was maybe just, you know, a lovely blue sky, but... Clouds.

07:40.533 --> 07:40.613
Yeah.

07:41.774 --> 07:42.275
There's Pero.

07:43.149 --> 07:44.450
Yeah, he's not a cloud.

07:44.470 --> 07:49.371
I guess he's just going on his way from place to place, huh?

07:49.631 --> 07:54.953
You know sometimes working on a construction site, sometimes becoming a Perroccino.

07:55.334 --> 07:59.075
Right, yeah, but, uh, I don't know.

08:00.015 --> 08:06.878
Taking a good look at it, he actually looks kind of nice up in the beautiful sky like that.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.544
Kinda cute, I think.

08:11.044 --> 08:12.746
I don't know, maybe it's the clouds.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.888
I mean, it does make him look kind of pleasant.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.910
No, it's super nasty!

08:17.950 --> 08:18.190
Why?

08:18.991 --> 08:20.212
What do you think, Ruffians?

08:22.353 --> 08:23.554
He's living the life!

08:23.574 --> 08:25.136
I don't know about that.

08:25.216 --> 08:26.136
Like a cloud.

08:26.156 --> 08:28.598
Still nasty!

08:28.919 --> 08:29.639
His wings work.

08:29.739 --> 08:30.500
They work.

08:31.381 --> 08:31.841
Yeah.

08:32.622 --> 08:34.003
Very muscular cloud.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.784
Is Pero a relative Totoro?

08:35.844 --> 08:36.024
No.

08:37.005 --> 08:37.165
No.

08:37.446 --> 08:37.566
No.

08:38.470 --> 08:39.631
No, unfortunately no.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.351
That would have been nice, but no.

08:43.432 --> 08:44.333
Still nasty?

08:45.173 --> 08:45.993
The verdict is in.

08:46.554 --> 08:48.074
Still nasty.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.315
Ruffians, you know it.

08:50.836 --> 08:53.217
Just for your sake.

08:53.797 --> 08:58.559
It's probably best not to make eye contact with him if you see him around, okay?

08:59.359 --> 08:59.960
Turn around.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.341
Like you saw an anomaly, okay?

09:02.381 --> 09:03.701
Turn around, go the other way.

09:05.362 --> 09:06.483
You never know what could happen.

09:06.723 --> 09:07.183
Okay?

09:08.863 --> 09:10.785
BAU BAU!

09:11.825 --> 09:12.526
BAU BAU!

09:27.271 --> 09:32.012
Yesterday was a very busy day for FUWAMOCO.

09:32.512 --> 09:36.173
And maybe Ruffians, it was a busy day for you too.

09:36.633 --> 09:41.634
So, we thought we'd give you an update!

09:41.974 --> 09:42.795
Nerissa!

09:42.815 --> 09:43.915
Advent.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.505
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

10:00.691 --> 10:02.733
Ruffians, are you familiar with the song?

10:03.553 --> 10:03.934
Yeah.

10:04.975 --> 10:07.617
You know, it's a really famous winter song in Japan, you know?

10:08.098 --> 10:09.299
It's very emotional.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.162
It's one of the famous classic winter love songs.

10:13.182 --> 10:14.043
You've heard it before!

10:14.123 --> 10:15.224
It's sort of like white love!

10:15.244 --> 10:16.185
Yeah.

10:17.066 --> 10:18.267
But Nerissa, she sang...

10:18.769 --> 10:24.577
A really beautiful rendition of this song, so definitely have to make sure you check it out, okay?

10:24.637 --> 10:25.378
Ruffians!

10:25.698 --> 10:28.402
And also take a weight off if you haven't yet either, okay?

10:28.422 --> 10:31.726
Also a very famous winter song.

10:31.806 --> 10:33.388
This is little time for that.

10:33.528 --> 10:34.009
Why not?

10:34.610 --> 10:35.110
It's our show.

10:38.581 --> 10:43.944
Thank you for the beautiful music Nerissa!

10:43.964 --> 10:45.665
That's what you wanted to say, huh?

10:45.785 --> 10:47.946
That's what I wanted to say!

10:47.966 --> 10:48.266
BAU BAU!

11:02.472 --> 11:04.075
Something went very wrong there, huh?

11:04.656 --> 11:07.380
Mococo.exe is still loading okay.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.241
BAU BAU!

11:12.273 --> 11:24.384
Well, Ruffians, today is Friday, the 67th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning, but more importantly, today is Pekora-senpai's birthday!

11:24.464 --> 11:26.866
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:27.506 --> 11:31.009
Happy birthday, Pekora-senpai!

11:31.049 --> 11:39.156
Well, it's Pekora-senpai's birthday, so we phoned into her birthday stream earlier today, and somehow, there,

11:40.137 --> 11:44.999
It was determined that we are now three sisters.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.840
A trio of three sisters!

11:47.441 --> 11:48.621
FUWAMOCO Pickle!

11:49.041 --> 11:49.342
Yeah.

11:49.662 --> 11:50.502
Got that, ruffians.

11:50.582 --> 11:51.823
FUWAMOCO Pickle!

11:52.423 --> 11:52.643
Yeah.

11:52.663 --> 11:53.283
Even tail.

11:54.284 --> 11:54.604
Check.

11:54.824 --> 11:55.044
Check.

11:55.565 --> 11:56.125
Silly.

11:56.845 --> 11:57.105
Check.

11:57.466 --> 11:57.926
Check!

11:59.146 --> 11:59.547
Dog.

12:01.728 --> 12:02.068
Meow.

12:03.171 --> 12:03.791
Yeah!

12:04.032 --> 12:08.995
You know, I don't know if this makes us triplets, like Pekora-senpai was saying earlier.

12:09.075 --> 12:11.997
Especially since you know her birthday is today.

12:12.217 --> 12:14.378
But... That's okay!

12:14.518 --> 12:18.241
I know she was also saying we'd be like, soberish.

12:18.601 --> 12:21.322
But... What about Pero?

12:23.504 --> 12:26.126
Is he being replaced by... Peko?

12:28.050 --> 12:32.336
I saw a ruffian asking what happened to Pororo onee-chan.

12:32.356 --> 12:33.637
Oh, nothing.

12:36.100 --> 12:36.641
Nothing.

12:36.661 --> 12:40.025
We can have multiple sisters, right?

12:40.445 --> 12:41.427
I mean, you're here too.

12:41.447 --> 12:44.510
You're not gonna forget about me, Moco-chan.

12:45.526 --> 12:48.748
Not like you did with Poruru-oneechan.

12:49.809 --> 12:50.689
I did!

12:51.990 --> 12:52.451
Wow!

12:52.551 --> 12:52.951
Okay.

12:53.191 --> 12:58.054
Moco-chan also drew a special picture for Pororo-san.

12:58.094 --> 12:58.294
Yeah!

12:58.355 --> 13:00.856
What do you think, Ruffians?

13:01.336 --> 13:05.499
Do you like it?

13:05.719 --> 13:07.641
Kusa.

13:09.962 --> 13:10.743
I do it, you know.

13:11.997 --> 13:12.918
I drew it, you know.

13:12.938 --> 13:14.439
It's cute, it's very cute!

13:14.499 --> 13:17.241
Do you like Pegura-senpai's teeth?

13:17.361 --> 13:19.002
I made it accurate.

13:31.699 --> 13:38.705
Yeah, well, Pekora-senpai, she liked it so much that she actually covered up Hakurei-senpai's picture with it.

13:38.725 --> 13:41.307
Sorry Hakurei-senpai!

13:42.107 --> 13:47.091
But you know, even if the ruffians think kusai, at least Pekora-senpai liked it.

13:47.131 --> 13:51.515
That's what matters because it's for Pekora-senpai, not the ruffians!

13:51.615 --> 13:52.816
BAU BAU BAU!

14:04.922 --> 14:07.122
Well, ruffians.

14:08.483 --> 14:15.766
Actually, recently, some things kind of come to our attention.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.647
I kind of feel that ruffians, you might have noticed it too.

14:20.667 --> 14:21.088
Maybe.

14:23.510 --> 14:34.543
Wow, it seems like Icomochi-mama has come down with a very severe case of BAU BAU BYOU.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.185
Did you notice it too?

14:37.427 --> 14:38.188
Busted!

14:38.368 --> 14:38.868
Yeah!

14:40.678 --> 14:49.585
Yeah, well, recently Icomochi-mama has been extra sweet, and silly, and tweeting a bunch, and watching us tweet!

14:50.025 --> 14:53.909
It makes us super duper happy!

14:54.149 --> 14:59.173
We can't help it, you know, when we have such a wonderful, loving, and involved mama!

14:59.193 --> 15:01.134
It makes us really happy!

15:01.294 --> 15:05.217
You know, a mama that loves us and really wants to get to know us too!

15:06.414 --> 15:09.977
Like Fuwawa said, very, very happy.

15:10.017 --> 15:18.403
But, well, you know, BAU BAU will be... There's not too much known about it still.

15:18.703 --> 15:24.667
So, we hope that Icomochi-mama's BAU BAU doesn't get too bad.

15:24.988 --> 15:30.652
But recently, Icomochi-mama has also been tweeting lots on her sub account.

15:30.752 --> 15:31.673
Sub account.

15:32.473 --> 15:37.418
More than a mama!

15:38.740 --> 15:44.565
Somehow Icomochi-mama started to feel like she's a grandpa watching over grandkids.

15:49.290 --> 15:54.996
Makes you a ruffian, makes you watch over Icomochi-mama so her BAU BAU doesn't get

15:56.910 --> 15:58.050
Okay, no progressing.

15:58.070 --> 16:06.477
You know, we would definitely, definitely, definitely never, ever, ever want that, you know?

16:07.177 --> 16:09.219
No progressing on the BAU BAU of you and me.

16:09.459 --> 16:09.659
No.

16:10.199 --> 16:13.041
Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely not.

16:13.262 --> 16:16.104
Love you Icomochi-mama!

16:16.144 --> 16:16.684
Love you!

16:16.704 --> 16:20.067
See you very soon.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.689
Bye-bye!

16:23.709 --> 16:24.150
Bye-bye!

16:26.707 --> 16:27.948
That wouldn't be you!

16:28.328 --> 16:32.569
But you are mama.

16:32.809 --> 16:34.790
I don't think you're Icomochi-mama, no!

16:35.010 --> 16:38.451
I'm not really sort of happy.

16:39.271 --> 16:40.252
Sort of happy.

16:40.532 --> 16:41.932
Something else.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.653
Well, ruffians.

16:45.273 --> 16:48.074
We know our eyes are strong, right?

16:49.655 --> 16:50.355
Right?

16:51.075 --> 16:53.616
We know who we are.

16:54.568 --> 16:57.030
She even has four eyes now, right?

16:58.671 --> 16:59.171
BAU BAU.

17:00.632 --> 17:07.536
So then, do you know what I'm about to say, ruffians?

17:09.037 --> 17:09.717
You know it?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.742
You don't know it, do you, huh?

17:16.982 --> 17:18.643
What's with that tone, Moco-chan?

17:21.625 --> 17:22.065
I saw it.

17:25.333 --> 17:25.913
On Twitter.

17:32.639 --> 17:34.740
Why did you think I wouldn't say hi?

17:36.482 --> 17:37.122
Hi!

17:38.583 --> 17:42.426
You know, for the good ruffians who don't know what I'm talking about.

17:42.887 --> 17:50.853
You know, on Twitter, there was some intense discussion about my fuzziness.

17:53.015 --> 17:53.175
But,

17:54.207 --> 17:55.808
Rather than discussion, really.

17:55.828 --> 17:58.550
It was just bullying!

17:59.871 --> 18:00.911
All bullying!

18:01.572 --> 18:07.175
Saying that I should have been more curvy in some areas because this and that and this and that!

18:07.596 --> 18:10.678
And everyone was just saying that I was pitiful!

18:15.541 --> 18:19.603
Well, you know, there were some things like... Oh no!

18:20.204 --> 18:21.465
Poor BAU BAU!

18:21.565 --> 18:21.645
And...

18:24.107 --> 18:31.048
Like, show her this and, uh, are you sure they're twins and, uh, does she lack nutrition?

18:31.708 --> 18:34.649
Does she make it up for it in personality?

18:34.669 --> 18:34.749
Yeah.

18:38.749 --> 18:41.830
That I'm good despite it anyways.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.011
Have you ever tried saying that to a girl?

18:48.491 --> 18:49.011
Hi!

18:52.992 --> 18:53.392
Not well.

18:54.946 --> 18:58.728
You still like her, but despite how she looks, huh?

19:00.888 --> 19:01.208
Huh?

19:04.330 --> 19:04.930
What the heck?

19:08.771 --> 19:15.134
You know what I want to say, you know?

19:18.035 --> 19:21.577
And, you know, you wonder why I always want to be reassured, huh?

19:25.000 --> 19:25.880
Nevermind them.

19:26.940 --> 19:27.321
I guess.

19:29.621 --> 19:30.241
Whatever.

19:31.642 --> 19:32.402
Next corner!

19:35.983 --> 19:38.963
It's okay, it's just a misunderstanding, right Ruffians?

19:39.584 --> 19:41.264
It's just a misunderstanding, huh?

19:41.284 --> 19:41.444
Right?

19:42.224 --> 19:42.544
Right?

19:47.571 --> 19:50.452
Speaking of misunderstandings, ruffians!

19:50.472 --> 20:08.421
This is a little silly, but it seems like ever since it became the new year, there has been a serious, serious... There's been no misunderstanding.

20:09.321 --> 20:09.541
No.

20:10.942 --> 20:11.122
Huh?

20:12.743 --> 20:12.943
Huh?

20:12.963 --> 20:13.263
It's good.

20:15.464 --> 20:15.804
It's good.

20:17.298 --> 20:17.558
Huh?

20:18.640 --> 20:19.161
That's great!

20:20.723 --> 20:31.719
For all the ruffians you know, all the ruffians out there who have interesting tastes and maybe enjoy things like the misunderstandings that were happening.

20:33.078 --> 20:33.579
Sorry?

20:33.619 --> 20:34.119
Not sorry.

20:34.759 --> 20:36.521
Wow!

20:37.001 --> 20:38.502
You know, FUWAMOCO.

20:39.383 --> 20:43.086
Maybe we're just getting too fast to react and setting the record straight.

20:43.386 --> 20:51.032
You know, maybe this is the power of being a member of hololive for about six months now.

20:53.134 --> 20:54.294
What do you think?

20:54.394 --> 20:56.116
It can't be!

20:56.256 --> 20:57.817
No!

20:57.917 --> 20:58.558
No!

20:58.678 --> 20:59.438
Can't be!

20:59.498 --> 20:59.959
Good!

21:01.588 --> 21:02.308
BAU BAU!

21:02.328 --> 21:02.688
BAU BAU!

21:02.748 --> 21:03.009
BAU BAU!

21:03.049 --> 21:03.609
BAU BAU!

21:03.749 --> 21:04.529
BAU BAU!

21:31.075 --> 21:31.695
What?

21:32.756 --> 21:35.797
I had a bunch of dreams yesterday!

21:35.817 --> 21:39.578
It was a bit questionable though.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.219
So, get ready, okay?

21:42.520 --> 21:43.120
Get ready?

21:43.240 --> 21:45.561
Explain first.

21:46.241 --> 21:52.163
I first had a bad dream where I kind of woke up in a panic because Moco-chan died in it.

21:52.824 --> 21:57.666
So naturally, Moco-chan let me into her bed until I calmed down.

21:57.706 --> 21:58.706
Yeah, because I'm good.

21:59.086 --> 22:00.687
I'm a nice little sister, okay?

22:01.964 --> 22:03.406
Yeah, you know.

22:03.927 --> 22:08.634
And then, well, I got maybe a bit too comfy.

22:09.054 --> 22:10.076
She said just a bit.

22:10.657 --> 22:11.899
And I fell asleep there.

22:12.523 --> 22:15.605
Yeah, which led me to my next stream!

22:18.267 --> 22:23.290
I joked that, you know, we were just about to finish the stream together with you, Ruffians!

22:23.750 --> 22:29.213
But we were both so exhausted afterwards that I fell asleep before we ended things off.

22:30.674 --> 22:34.597
And we just continued sleeping for 8 hours while still alive!

22:37.310 --> 22:38.050
Eight hours.

22:38.210 --> 22:39.071
Eight hours.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.251
Endurance sleep.

22:40.431 --> 22:41.531
Endurance sleep!

22:41.671 --> 22:42.692
Hi!

22:42.752 --> 22:48.654
You could hear our heavy breathing and our sleep breathing really clearly!

22:48.674 --> 22:53.935
And it was embarrassing because you could also hear our grumbly tummies too.

22:54.035 --> 22:58.117
We didn't eat dinner yesterday so it's grumbly time.

22:58.897 --> 23:05.499
You know, and sometimes I like roll over and we grumble and fight over the blankets!

23:06.119 --> 23:09.261
And I start to sleep talk too.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.283
BAU BAU.

23:11.363 --> 23:14.145
BAU BAU.

23:15.226 --> 23:22.751
I was really worried about it though, but when I woke up in my dream, apparently you really enjoyed it, Ruffians!

23:23.371 --> 23:25.053
What?!

23:25.753 --> 23:27.714
That would be a really cool stream!

23:28.735 --> 23:30.136
Next stream of the year!

23:31.117 --> 23:31.537
Huh?!

23:31.577 --> 23:31.997
No way.

23:34.928 --> 23:37.369
I woke up in a dream and I was like, oh no.

23:39.971 --> 23:43.333
When I actually woke up I was like, oh my goodness.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.254
Great stream idea!

23:45.394 --> 23:46.895
New stream idea!

23:46.915 --> 23:49.496
I thought we would though.

23:51.337 --> 23:53.919
I don't want the ruffians to hear my grumbly tummy.

23:54.959 --> 23:57.541
I guess you like that sort of idea high.

23:59.545 --> 24:00.025
Hi!

24:00.106 --> 24:02.708
I don't know, ruffians!

24:03.068 --> 24:03.889
Please!

24:05.130 --> 24:08.252
BAU BAU!

24:08.433 --> 24:09.453
You have a weird high.

24:09.513 --> 24:13.517
Fuwawa is weird for having a weird dream!

24:14.037 --> 24:16.059
And the ruffians are weird for liking it.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.021
And weird for bullying me.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.964
Ruffians completely forgot about my bad dream though, huh?

24:23.005 --> 24:24.166
They didn't care enough.

24:27.339 --> 24:30.261
Why do you like Doggie of the Day?

24:30.321 --> 24:33.863
Yo, let's check out who is the Doggie of the Day today.

24:34.303 --> 24:44.470
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Kii!

24:44.530 --> 24:46.171
Hi Kii!

24:46.231 --> 24:48.392
Kii is so handsome!

24:48.432 --> 24:50.734
I feel like we've had a lot of huskies, huh?

24:51.034 --> 24:52.395
Oh, well, the more huskies...

24:53.035 --> 24:54.276
I guess it is snowy.

24:54.516 --> 24:55.017
Right!

24:55.137 --> 24:59.540
Yeah, well, King is apparently a very silly rascal.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.682
I just love him very, very dearly.

25:03.203 --> 25:07.426
Yeah, he has a little hard time hearing, but that doesn't stop him at all!

25:07.606 --> 25:13.891
Actually, I... Last night, cause, you know, we had to record.

25:14.752 --> 25:16.293
Fuwawa was having issues.

25:18.192 --> 25:21.153
Whenever I went, BAU BAU!

25:21.673 --> 25:27.896
At a certain frequency, you're here with me like, I can't tell what's going on.

25:29.036 --> 25:30.637
Yeah, it was just funny.

25:31.317 --> 25:33.438
It's so cute though.

25:33.458 --> 25:36.078
How in this game BAU BAU?

25:37.359 --> 25:39.200
I think, I think it's, huh?

25:39.300 --> 25:40.160
BAU BAU!

25:41.510 --> 25:42.551
BAU BAU!

25:43.011 --> 25:43.951
That intense?

25:44.011 --> 25:45.112
Yeah, very loud.

25:45.192 --> 25:46.893
Like BAU!

25:46.973 --> 25:49.074
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

25:49.895 --> 25:50.635
No, like that.

25:50.835 --> 25:52.236
It could be that.

25:52.616 --> 25:53.056
Like that?

25:54.457 --> 25:55.698
Strong BAU BAU!

25:56.178 --> 26:00.620
That's pretty good.

26:01.261 --> 26:02.361
Like that?

26:02.461 --> 26:04.643
I don't think that came BAU BAUs like that though.

26:06.424 --> 26:07.084
Then which is it?

26:07.544 --> 26:08.565
I think it's more like yours.

26:12.490 --> 26:13.031
BAU BAU!

26:13.151 --> 26:17.774
Well, you know, Kate, Kate is loving life together with you.

26:17.834 --> 26:25.639
He's ready for all the days, you know, spring, summer, fall, and especially the snowy winter ones.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.543
He's ready to have a lot of fun together with his dear ruffians.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.303
BAU BAU!

26:31.664 --> 26:33.765
BAU BAU!

26:35.026 --> 26:38.989
Now, next for today, I went on a walk

26:39.589 --> 26:40.869
We have... De-den!

26:41.990 --> 26:44.530
Is this a walk?

26:46.191 --> 26:47.651
It's a massive moth!

26:48.311 --> 26:49.311
A massive walk!

26:49.551 --> 26:51.392
A massive walk on a massive moth?

26:51.652 --> 26:53.392
Or a massive walk on a massive moth?

26:54.013 --> 26:55.353
Which one is it?

26:55.393 --> 26:58.634
We both think moths are really cool, but... Yeah.

26:58.674 --> 27:03.195
To be honest, I think I'd probably scream if I saw this one flying around.

27:04.595 --> 27:05.015
Yeah.

27:05.255 --> 27:06.316
Moco-chan, you too?

27:06.876 --> 27:07.156
Yeah.

27:07.856 --> 27:08.116
Yeah.

27:09.738 --> 27:11.919
If it's just a word, it's not that bad.

27:11.939 --> 27:13.320
It's like a bird.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.661
It's very pretty.

27:14.721 --> 27:17.342
It also looks like it has snake heads on it.

27:20.584 --> 27:21.704
I'm not a fan of that.

27:24.066 --> 27:26.047
Well, Moc-sister!

27:26.167 --> 27:29.749
We hope you had a wonderful time visiting your grandparents!

27:30.169 --> 27:33.010
We're sure you brought a big smile to their faces.

27:33.070 --> 27:33.991
BAU BAU!

27:36.983 --> 27:40.144
Next we have our question of the day.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.105
It is de-den!

27:43.806 --> 27:47.327
In what ways do you feel you've changed the most since your debut?

27:47.787 --> 27:54.490
It's surely been a big lifestyle switch since your time in the show, so how do you think that has affected you the most?

27:56.030 --> 27:57.711
Ah, lifestyle switch.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.188
Ruffians!

28:05.768 --> 28:10.473
You know how hungry we were when we debuted and everything.

28:11.094 --> 28:12.635
Pretty hungry, right?

28:13.296 --> 28:16.119
No, I think we were able to show that with our actions too.

28:16.659 --> 28:17.160
Hungry.

28:17.950 --> 28:19.492
You know, today!

28:20.393 --> 28:22.915
Today even marks our 250th video actually!

28:22.975 --> 28:24.357
If this happens.

28:24.517 --> 28:27.821
But to tell you the truth, Ruffians... Well...

28:32.526 --> 28:34.767
You've made us even hungrier now.

28:34.787 --> 28:35.648
Oops!

28:36.508 --> 28:39.210
So we want to keep aiming as high as we can.

28:39.250 --> 28:44.453
You know, pushing through the tough times so that we can make some amazing things happen all together.

28:44.913 --> 28:50.836
So you know, we're just continuing to run just as fast as we have since we debuted back in July.

28:51.157 --> 28:54.018
And hopefully all of our crazy dreams can come true, okay?

28:54.278 --> 28:57.860
But, you know, at the end of the day, we're just FUWAMOCO.

28:58.241 --> 29:00.062
So we're gonna have fun with it.

29:00.082 --> 29:01.122
Yeah, have fun.

29:01.302 --> 29:01.863
Do our best.

29:02.602 --> 29:03.339
Let's see what happens.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.633
BAU BAU!

29:07.194 --> 29:08.274
Thank you, Ruffians!

29:08.354 --> 29:11.335
Thank you so much for all your submissions!

29:11.775 --> 29:15.396
Please remember that FUWAMOCO Morning is something we make together.

29:15.816 --> 29:20.357
So, we're always waiting for more of your questions!

29:20.397 --> 29:23.778
Your Doggy of the Days, your Pero Sightings, your vlogs!

29:24.278 --> 29:25.558
All your submissions, okay?

29:25.858 --> 29:27.659
And FUWAMOCO Scoop, don't forget!

29:28.159 --> 29:29.599
Ruffians, I know you can.

29:29.859 --> 29:31.419
You know what's going on.

Great assets.

30:08.279 --> 30:08.920
Great assets.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.820

30:11.821 --> 30:12.882

30:13.602 --> 30:16.383
And we take a peek at the schedule.

30:16.424 --> 30:17.084
The schedule.

30:17.684 --> 30:21.586
Well, on Saturday we have a rock n' roll party!

30:21.666 --> 30:23.207
Rock n' roll party!

30:23.227 --> 30:24.628
I'm a ruffian as well.

30:25.328 --> 30:27.109
This time, there's a theme.

30:28.190 --> 30:29.730
There's usually a theme.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.831
A theme that we're very excited about.

30:31.911 --> 30:32.552
Yeah.

30:32.612 --> 30:32.872
Right.

30:34.738 --> 30:36.519
Tell us.

30:36.539 --> 30:37.099
Tell us.

30:37.239 --> 30:37.959
It's not Apple.

30:54.585 --> 30:54.985
De-den!

30:55.025 --> 30:56.245
The theme is winter songs!

30:56.265 --> 30:56.565
BAU BAU!

30:56.606 --> 31:06.348
We're really excited to be singing some of our favorite winter anime songs and G-POP.

31:19.710 --> 31:25.411
Got some extra special songs prepared for you too, so please don't miss it, okay?

31:25.471 --> 31:27.792
Prepared specially for this, okay?

31:28.192 --> 31:29.212
Snow Halation?

31:29.952 --> 31:32.173
What do you mean?

31:32.233 --> 31:34.493
I've never ever heard of that song.

31:34.713 --> 31:35.793
Ever.

31:35.973 --> 31:38.194
That's the song you sing in the summertime, right?

31:38.254 --> 31:38.854
Definitely.

31:38.874 --> 31:39.514
Yeah.

31:40.854 --> 31:44.035
Well, it's also not on our schedule, but...

31:44.355 --> 31:49.897
On Sunday, we'll also be continuing to read your superchats before I go home.

31:50.277 --> 31:52.818
I'm from 1pm PT, right?

31:54.399 --> 31:55.319
Thank you, Ruffians.

31:55.359 --> 31:57.840

32:07.583 --> 32:11.105

32:13.583 --> 32:15.209
We hope you're looking forward to it!

32:15.409 --> 32:18.179
Remember ruffians, no bullying!

32:20.451 --> 32:20.831
