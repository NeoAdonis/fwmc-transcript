05:04.560 --> 05:06.635
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:07.276 --> 05:10.582
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:10.602 --> 05:12.125
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.846 --> 05:22.168
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.709 --> 05:25.070
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:25.331 --> 05:28.092
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:28.172 --> 05:29.934
BAU BAU!

05:29.954 --> 05:35.758
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:35.838 --> 05:37.359
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:38.039 --> 05:41.822
It's the 83rd FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.942 --> 05:46.385
Thank you for having us as a part of your morning.

05:47.205 --> 05:49.126
Wow, we feel really lucky.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.288
Especially so today.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.910
BAU BAU!

05:55.550 --> 06:06.076
Wow, for any Ruffians joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:06.096 --> 06:06.496
A.K.A.

06:06.637 --> 06:07.937
FUWAMOCO!

06:08.598 --> 06:11.960
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:12.760 --> 06:18.423
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:18.643 --> 06:21.544
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

06:21.684 --> 06:23.925
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

06:24.125 --> 06:28.047
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:28.607 --> 06:30.748
BAU BAU!

06:33.464 --> 06:38.205
Ruffians, I don't know if that's supposed to be the part where you get excited about.

06:38.225 --> 06:40.945
BAU BAU.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.566
I'm happy to see you excited though.

06:43.586 --> 06:43.746
Yeah!

06:43.866 --> 06:45.866
It's good to be excited in the morning.

06:45.886 --> 06:50.227
There's another amazing day waiting for us, Ruffians!

06:50.527 --> 06:52.487
So let's do our best today too.

06:52.507 --> 06:54.928
FUWAMOCO-chan!

06:56.068 --> 06:58.188
What's been going on for FUWAMOCO?

06:58.208 --> 07:00.389
What do you have this FUWAMOCO Morning?

07:03.143 --> 07:05.724
Maybe this isn't as exciting.

07:06.004 --> 07:06.264
Huh?

07:07.704 --> 07:08.225
Exciting?

07:08.285 --> 07:09.325
Not exciting?

07:09.545 --> 07:10.385
Which one is it?

07:10.925 --> 07:14.006
There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:17.147 --> 07:17.707
Well!

07:18.748 --> 07:20.328
Where's Pero this time, huh?

07:21.108 --> 07:21.909
Let's see!

07:21.929 --> 07:23.889
De-den!

07:24.509 --> 07:25.530
Oh!

07:26.050 --> 07:27.250
This is cute!

07:28.511 --> 07:29.731
But... Pero...

07:32.232 --> 07:36.714
You say he's making friends, but... Are you sure?

07:38.295 --> 07:39.715
Are you supervising them?

07:39.735 --> 07:48.659
I don't know what... If you don't, things could get very ugly very quick.

07:50.839 --> 07:54.081
But, you know, your life is busy too.

07:54.121 --> 07:57.682
You don't have all day to watch over them and see that nothing weird happens.

08:01.914 --> 08:02.978
I have an idea.

08:03.419 --> 08:03.580
Well...

08:06.540 --> 08:08.761
Some very cute plushies there.

08:09.622 --> 08:16.286
Why don't you make sure to add two RUFFIAN plushies to your household as well?

08:16.606 --> 08:21.068
That way, they can help guard over and monitor the situation for you.

08:21.128 --> 08:22.369
Good idea!

08:22.509 --> 08:22.969
Right?

08:24.310 --> 08:30.834
You know, Ruffians, you can still add more RUFFIAN plushies to your army right now, so don't forget!

08:31.094 --> 08:31.654
Don't forget!

08:33.387 --> 08:33.927
We can't forget.

08:33.947 --> 08:34.927
We can't forget!

08:35.327 --> 08:37.328
If you want an army, now is the chance!

08:37.388 --> 08:39.449
Ruffian army.

08:39.749 --> 08:40.809
Ima shika nai!

08:41.329 --> 08:46.190
You know, I really like how they're peeking around the door at you.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.190
Even Pero?

08:47.731 --> 08:48.811
It's cute.

08:48.931 --> 08:50.131
Even Pero maybe.

08:50.151 --> 08:57.493
Well, I hope everything works out and you know, that you have fun with the company there too.

08:58.113 --> 08:59.273
BAU BAU!

09:01.514 --> 09:02.435
Yeah.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.777
Pero meets Takodachi.

09:04.957 --> 09:05.497
I know.

09:05.798 --> 09:07.519
Hopefully everything will be okay.

09:07.619 --> 09:09.201
It'll be a nice meeting, huh?

09:09.501 --> 09:09.841
Yeah.

09:10.021 --> 09:10.662
For sure!

09:10.742 --> 09:11.062
Yeah.

09:11.182 --> 09:12.844
BAU BAU.

09:12.944 --> 09:13.404
BAU BAU!

09:13.444 --> 09:16.247
Ruffians!

09:16.767 --> 09:28.557
In just a few weeks, hololive Expo 2024 and FIFTH FES capture the moment will be happening in Tokyo at Makuhari Messe!

09:28.597 --> 09:29.077
BAU BAU!

09:32.320 --> 09:35.043
We're very excited.

09:35.063 --> 09:47.634
There's even more exciting news coming out right now.

09:48.214 --> 09:51.658
You might know, but Expo is like a big party, right?

09:51.818 --> 09:52.618
Big party, yeah.

09:54.128 --> 09:59.792
What's a party without some food and drinks?

10:00.513 --> 10:01.834
BAU BAU!

10:01.854 --> 10:03.816
Dance food!

10:03.836 --> 10:07.999
And also, this year's theme, hololive Foods and Beverages, were just announced.

10:08.779 --> 10:11.201
And among that lineup is...

10:13.128 --> 10:18.030
I'm FUWAMOCO Drink!

10:18.511 --> 10:19.051
BAU BAU!

10:19.171 --> 10:21.752
I'm FUWAMOCO Drink, what do you think, Ruffians?

10:22.472 --> 10:28.415
To explain a little bit about it, it's a white soda based drink featuring us!

10:30.596 --> 10:31.797
FUWAMOCO!

10:31.817 --> 10:34.598
Mio-senpai did a taste test of...

10:49.605 --> 10:49.925
FUWAMOCO Milk!

10:49.965 --> 10:50.827
It's a white soda ruffian.

10:50.847 --> 10:51.527
White soda!

11:09.649 --> 11:14.131
Okay, but you know Mio-senpai also came up with a cat copy for it.

11:14.731 --> 11:20.334
And it was something like, you might drown in their fluffy and fuzzy cream.

11:20.914 --> 11:27.076
It's so busy that you'll BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:27.136 --> 11:30.378
I'm glad that Mio-senpai enjoyed it.

11:30.718 --> 11:32.659
You know, if you get it at Expo as well!

11:34.031 --> 11:39.354
It'll also come with a special themed coaster and printed signature from our snow!

11:39.774 --> 11:42.236
If you get tasty, we love it!

11:42.316 --> 11:45.077
If you wanna choose, our special FUWAMOCO drink!

11:45.297 --> 11:47.258
BAU BAU!

11:47.278 --> 11:52.681
I don't know, I think this sounds a little bit better than the Fuwa Water.

11:52.721 --> 11:52.882
Why?

11:56.425 --> 11:58.046
It's a white soda, Ruffians.

11:58.807 --> 11:59.488
Use your brain.

11:59.528 --> 12:01.069
Like a whipped cream on top.

12:02.570 --> 12:03.891
And the sprinkles, too.

12:03.911 --> 12:04.432
Right!

12:04.912 --> 12:06.433
It's not complete without the sprinkles.

12:06.473 --> 12:12.498
And the coaster, too!

12:12.598 --> 12:14.080
I'm excited.

12:14.220 --> 12:17.282
Nomitai deshita!

12:17.663 --> 12:19.924
Liquid Pero-Pero's not included.

12:19.984 --> 12:20.205
No.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.887
It's the FUWAMOCO drink, not the Pero drink.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.349
That would be terrifying.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.002
I did not think about that.

12:29.943 --> 12:41.112
Ruffians, earlier this morning, FUWAMOCO, we were up early because we had a collab with Choco-senpai!

12:42.574 --> 12:45.676
Choco-senbin, Choco-sen.

12:46.197 --> 12:47.918
She took our measurements and I...

12:49.401 --> 12:52.503
Asked us some very personal questions.

12:53.104 --> 12:53.824
It's okay though.

12:53.864 --> 12:54.384
It's okay.

12:54.424 --> 12:55.025
You know it.

12:55.445 --> 12:56.886
Because it's Toko-sen.

12:57.146 --> 12:59.908
You know she'll help us with any of our issues.

13:00.028 --> 13:02.750
As a trustworthy class nurse she is, you know.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.693
She even said she would rub my tummy and make it feel better when it hurts.

13:06.873 --> 13:07.473
That's nice.

13:08.013 --> 13:08.194
Yeah.

13:09.955 --> 13:14.077
We talked about a bunch of things and we laughed a lot!

13:14.137 --> 13:16.099
And had a bunch of fun too!

13:16.419 --> 13:19.041
And Moco-chan, you even got to touch a horn, right?

13:19.081 --> 13:20.461
Yeah, I did!

13:21.442 --> 13:22.583
It felt nice, sorta.

13:22.863 --> 13:23.984
Sorta soft.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.245
Sorta hard.

13:29.787 --> 13:36.552
But, Ruffians... Only afterwards did I realize...

13:38.285 --> 13:39.526
Do you know what we forgot?

13:41.608 --> 13:41.888
Wow.

13:42.388 --> 13:47.132
We should have asked Choco-san about why Moco-chan sneezes so much.

13:47.692 --> 13:49.654
It would have been a good chance, huh?

13:49.814 --> 13:49.994
Right?

13:50.014 --> 13:51.776
We could have got that checked out.

13:51.796 --> 13:52.736
Right?

13:52.796 --> 13:57.120
It was finally the chance to get checked out by a professional we totally forgot!

13:57.140 --> 14:00.983
Ruffians.

14:02.164 --> 14:02.504
Why?

14:02.904 --> 14:05.386
Why didn't you remind us, huh?

14:06.067 --> 14:07.268
Huh, Ruffians?

14:09.335 --> 14:11.816
I guess we're all just having too much fun.

14:11.856 --> 14:12.197
Yeah.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.198
Probably!

14:14.238 --> 14:15.799
BAU BAU, yeah.

14:15.819 --> 14:17.700
Too much fun, right?

14:17.820 --> 14:18.740
Right!

14:18.861 --> 14:20.461
You have work!

14:20.521 --> 14:21.362
I guess that's a good excuse.

14:24.914 --> 14:26.274
I guess, you know, oh well.

14:26.594 --> 14:30.356
We'll just have to chat more with Tsukose sometime soon.

14:31.817 --> 14:33.098
That's only twice.

14:33.138 --> 14:37.160
Yup, and then you know, we can look forward to her professional opinion then.

14:37.480 --> 14:37.780
Right.

14:38.180 --> 14:38.440
Right.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.722
BAU BAU!

14:42.262 --> 14:43.643
Yeah, you missed something.

14:44.123 --> 14:46.905
A collab with Tsukose, maybe?

14:48.410 --> 14:51.953
Check it out over on Soko-san's channel!

14:52.033 --> 14:52.333
Okay!

14:52.614 --> 14:55.216
BAU BAU!

14:55.977 --> 14:56.217
So.

14:57.698 --> 14:58.279
Ruffians.

14:59.039 --> 15:02.362
I wonder, do you have this sometimes?

15:02.983 --> 15:07.006
You know, when you're trying to go to sleep and you're sort of starting to drift off.

15:07.867 --> 15:12.531
You know, some crazy thoughts come to your head, sort of knocking you out of that sleepy state.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.392
Do you have that?

15:14.753 --> 15:15.053
No.

15:15.714 --> 15:15.854
No?

15:17.797 --> 15:19.277
Every time, yeah.

15:19.677 --> 15:21.578
I hope it's not every time.

15:21.998 --> 15:26.879
Well, you know, the other day, the thought came to me.

15:27.739 --> 15:33.241
Does Pero have anyone special in his life?

15:33.261 --> 15:38.462
You know, is there, in fact, a so-called girly old friend of his?

15:40.311 --> 15:46.075
This is it!

15:46.496 --> 15:51.500
You know, he sure does seem to focus on cute girls sometimes.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.763
But truth be told, he's just our pet.

15:56.583 --> 16:00.486
So, we don't really know those details about his life.

16:01.887 --> 16:03.248
You know, we don't want to know.

16:03.789 --> 16:04.369
No.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.151
You know, why would we ask about stuff like that?

16:07.611 --> 16:08.732
It's not important.

16:08.772 --> 16:09.413
No, no.

16:11.207 --> 16:13.788
I mean, does he have any family members?

16:14.748 --> 16:18.289
If he had a sister, do you think she'd look like this, Ruffians?

16:18.949 --> 16:21.030
Would she be Pero Tina?

16:23.430 --> 16:24.831
Lots of questions, huh?

16:24.851 --> 16:25.571
I don't know.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.831
Maybe this is a bit of a disturbing thought.

16:28.231 --> 16:33.253
You see, you know, the ones that get you at that sleepy state are a bit strange, huh?

16:33.373 --> 16:33.793
Yeah.

16:34.613 --> 16:35.373
I don't know!

16:35.393 --> 16:37.174
Um, Moco-chan.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.993
It's kind of rude to think about these things, no?

16:41.353 --> 16:43.955
I can't control my sleep thoughts, okay?

16:44.275 --> 16:45.356
It just happens.

16:45.376 --> 16:49.638
It just came to me, you know, and I couldn't help but think about it.

16:49.738 --> 16:51.479
What do you think, Ruffians?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.761
I'm not being rude!

16:54.781 --> 16:56.002
I don't know.

16:56.322 --> 17:00.384
If there is a Perroccino, there could be a Perroccino, right?

17:00.524 --> 17:02.025
Don't misunderstand, okay, Ruffians?

17:02.125 --> 17:03.866
You have nightmares from this one?

17:06.688 --> 17:07.408
Yeah, well...

17:08.086 --> 17:09.787
You'd rather not think about it.

17:11.168 --> 17:14.849
I don't know if there is, in fact, a Perroccino.

17:15.850 --> 17:16.730
Do we want that?

17:18.791 --> 17:19.392
I don't know.

17:19.592 --> 17:20.712
My gut says no.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.374
I guess mine does too, huh?

17:25.915 --> 17:27.816
BAU BAU!

17:28.696 --> 17:29.597
It's too personal.

17:30.697 --> 17:31.958
You know what, Ruffians?

17:32.718 --> 17:33.858
Just forget about this.

17:34.238 --> 17:34.579
Yeah.

17:35.219 --> 17:41.001
If we think about it for too long, it just gets upsetting, so... I think they agree.

17:41.962 --> 17:43.682
Yeah.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.643
BAU BAU!

17:45.703 --> 17:46.083
BAU BAU.

17:46.624 --> 17:49.245
You don't wanna... I don't wanna go by the Perroccino.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.665
My Perroccino.

17:50.685 --> 17:55.607
BAU BAU.

17:56.948 --> 17:58.208
BAU BAU!

17:59.529 --> 17:59.929
Goodbye.

18:01.283 --> 18:03.444
Do we have anything happier, Moco-chan?

18:03.464 --> 18:04.745
Yeah!

18:04.805 --> 18:05.385
We do!

18:06.386 --> 18:07.947
That's good.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.568
I need something happier.

18:11.028 --> 18:11.909
Ruffians!

18:13.229 --> 18:14.750
You remember this, right?

18:14.770 --> 18:19.413
The Legendary Game Series.

18:20.202 --> 18:21.942
Toho!

18:22.423 --> 18:22.683
Right?

18:22.863 --> 18:29.324
Because recently we played a game from, well, the Legendary Bullet Hell series here and there.

18:30.044 --> 18:32.465
And Moco-chan was surprisingly good at it, right?

18:32.525 --> 18:33.065
Right!

18:33.145 --> 18:33.905
You know.

18:33.965 --> 18:34.406
Yeah.

18:34.506 --> 18:36.346
I even impressed myself a bit.

18:37.186 --> 18:40.087
You know, I really didn't think I'd get as far as I did, huh?

18:40.467 --> 18:41.747
Yeah, you were surprised!

18:41.887 --> 18:42.447
Right!

18:42.467 --> 18:43.388
Surprisingly, yes.

18:45.097 --> 18:45.557
Thank you.

18:45.577 --> 18:52.639
You know, the other day, Marine Senchou-senpai, she was playing Touhou Kanjuuden.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.440
The Legacy of the Lunatic Kingdom.

18:57.201 --> 19:01.482
And apparently, this is one of the most difficult Touhou games.

19:01.902 --> 19:05.903
And well, Senchou-senpai, she was still playing online.

19:05.943 --> 19:06.703
And not easy!

19:06.763 --> 19:07.264
Yeah!

19:07.344 --> 19:08.384
Even though it's so tough.

19:08.444 --> 19:11.725
And you know she was doing so well, but it got stuck.

19:12.405 --> 19:16.747
But then, you know, she would keep on trying until she cleared the area and continued.

19:16.767 --> 19:16.867
Right?

19:18.268 --> 19:19.648
Right, right!

19:19.668 --> 19:20.629
It was so amazing!

19:20.729 --> 19:28.072
I couldn't help but, you know, clap and be so noisy even though it's super early in the morning, right?

19:28.092 --> 19:28.432
Right!

19:28.452 --> 19:36.316
I don't know, we're always so amazed watching her play and, you know, she asked us to try to play Conjugate as well!

19:37.196 --> 19:38.717
What do you think, Ruffians?

19:41.815 --> 19:47.976
Should we maybe practice some other, maybe easier titles before taking on Kanji Den?

19:48.356 --> 19:51.257
Should we have to sit with Senpai's challenge?

19:51.277 --> 19:53.157
Yeah.

19:53.798 --> 19:54.698
Give it a go!

19:54.718 --> 19:55.238
Try it!

19:55.258 --> 19:58.458
It does sound like fun, that is true.

19:58.479 --> 19:59.699
It is, but you know what?

19:59.739 --> 20:01.099
Maybe get some coaching!

20:01.139 --> 20:01.479
Why?

20:01.499 --> 20:05.420
I really do enjoy playing Touhou, you know?

20:06.568 --> 20:09.972
I would like to get good at it too, like Senchou-senpai!

20:10.132 --> 20:13.316
She was saying, oh you really think I'm good, huh?

20:13.336 --> 20:14.777
Of course!

20:15.518 --> 20:20.785
It's a little spooky sometimes, right, Senchou-senpai?

20:21.205 --> 20:22.547
She's just so good at it!

20:24.164 --> 20:25.205
I don't know.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.287
Moco-chan, do your best, okay?

20:28.927 --> 20:30.669
BAU BAU!

20:30.729 --> 20:36.113
If you haven't tried it before, Ruffians, go check it out on Steam, okay?

20:41.411 --> 20:49.355
Well, in other news, actually, today we received a FUWAMOCO Scoop from a Ruffian!

20:49.395 --> 20:50.576
BAU BAU!

20:50.676 --> 20:55.938
Thank you so much, Vistaia, for the impeccable journalism!

20:56.358 --> 20:58.419
BAU BAU!

20:58.920 --> 21:07.284
Well, Ruffians, it seems like Hayada-senpai and Biboo tried their hands at the Keep Talking, No One Explodes game the other day.

21:08.044 --> 21:08.284
Right.

21:08.464 --> 21:12.106
It's always really fun and intense to remember when we played it, right Moco-chan?

21:12.306 --> 21:13.767
I definitely remember that!

21:13.967 --> 21:14.187
Right?

21:14.207 --> 21:20.971
We had so much fun diffusing the balls together and... We did so fast and coordinated.

21:21.031 --> 21:21.191
Yes.

21:21.951 --> 21:22.151
Yeah.

21:24.082 --> 21:24.682
Wow!

21:25.143 --> 21:36.811
It seems like when Biboo was trying to communicate some of the symbols to Kaede-senpai, I don't know if you can see it there, but there's kind of maybe a letter?

21:36.831 --> 21:37.671
A letter?

21:37.691 --> 21:38.452
A symbol?

21:39.433 --> 21:41.294
That reminded Biboo of something.

21:41.314 --> 21:47.498
Biboo, well, she started to imitate Moco-chan's accent.

21:48.078 --> 21:51.040
She was like, It's Mococo!

21:52.281 --> 21:53.022
Moco-chan.

21:53.988 --> 21:55.228
What do you think of this?

21:56.989 --> 21:58.129
I don't know what she means.

21:59.029 --> 22:00.749
What do people mean by this?

22:02.390 --> 22:02.730
No.

22:03.570 --> 22:04.270
Ruffians!

22:04.970 --> 22:10.591
If you're not familiar... I mean, it's been seven months or so, but if you're not familiar!

22:11.712 --> 22:13.732
My name is Mococo.

22:13.752 --> 22:14.132
M-O-C-O-C-O.

22:14.172 --> 22:14.332
Yep.

22:15.393 --> 22:17.413
That's how it's spelled.

22:23.064 --> 22:26.307
It's no E. No E. Yeah.

22:26.847 --> 22:30.730
So, did Kaila-senpai understand what Biboo meant by that?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.532
Biboo just being silly.

22:33.832 --> 22:35.834
Making Kaila-senpai confused.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.595
That won't make sense.

22:37.835 --> 22:38.156
Yeah.

22:38.536 --> 22:38.976
I don't know.

22:40.157 --> 22:43.360
I don't think her clue makes too much sense, so... Yeah.

22:43.620 --> 22:48.564
I don't think Kaila-senpai would've got it, but... She did.

22:49.845 --> 22:50.525
She understood.

22:50.565 --> 22:50.885
What?

22:53.404 --> 22:54.425
Immediately!

22:54.445 --> 23:03.433
Understood completely!

23:04.814 --> 23:07.476
I guess I'm glad that I could help.

23:09.598 --> 23:14.142
I'm glad you like it, for whatever reason.

23:14.162 --> 23:16.303
BAU BAU!

23:19.944 --> 23:20.864
I'm glad for you!

23:21.464 --> 23:31.148
You know, as long as Biboo's smiling, Haruna-senpai's smiling, and Ruffians... You're smiling!

23:31.188 --> 23:31.969
Then we're good.

23:32.389 --> 23:36.231
Yeah, but I don't know, maybe it's been a little rough recently.

23:36.251 --> 23:39.152
You know, we're getting to the end of the month.

23:39.832 --> 23:43.534
Maybe the weather's not as good, you know?

23:47.728 --> 23:48.569
Wow, Moco-chan!

23:48.609 --> 23:54.698
Do you have something that maybe you could share with us today?

23:54.839 --> 23:57.142
Do you want that?

23:59.588 --> 24:00.589
The weather's a lot better?

24:00.669 --> 24:01.589
Oh, that's good then!

24:01.609 --> 24:02.690
You don't need it then!

24:02.710 --> 24:03.991
The weather is good!

24:04.011 --> 24:05.752
Doggie of the Day, Doggie of the Day.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.654
I think the Doggie of the Day today is more cute, maybe.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.056
The weather is good, the weather is okay.

24:11.176 --> 24:14.438
Yeah, you have more than enough energy and support than mine.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.140
Wait, please!

24:16.580 --> 24:17.861
Please, Mococo!

24:17.921 --> 24:19.362
Well then!

24:22.284 --> 24:23.445
Ruffians!

24:24.826 --> 24:26.066
It's today!

24:26.847 --> 24:27.828
Today again!

24:29.224 --> 24:31.125
It's that day of the week!

24:32.145 --> 24:35.406
It's the day of the week for our Mococo Pup Talk!

24:36.026 --> 24:38.027
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

24:38.047 --> 24:38.627
Mococo!

24:38.687 --> 24:39.407
Ruffians!

24:41.007 --> 24:45.369
Good morning!

24:47.409 --> 24:49.250
Good morning!

24:52.131 --> 24:53.531
Are you still sleepy there?

24:55.832 --> 24:55.932
Uh...

24:57.443 --> 25:00.145
I can still see the sleep in your eyes a bit, huh?

25:02.868 --> 25:04.950
Has it been a bit rough recently?

25:04.970 --> 25:08.873
Have you been working especially hard?

25:10.054 --> 25:10.494
I don't know.

25:10.915 --> 25:12.136
It sure looks that way to me.

25:13.177 --> 25:13.777
Don't worry!

25:14.278 --> 25:17.741
You're doing amazing!

25:19.862 --> 25:20.703
Here's a head pat.

25:21.184 --> 25:22.345
For all the good work!

25:23.666 --> 25:24.767
Nare nare nare nare!

25:26.638 --> 25:27.358
I know, I know.

25:27.819 --> 25:33.822
With the lack of sleep and the worries of everything on your shoulders, it can be a bit tough.

25:34.522 --> 25:41.246
Sometimes you can't help but feel overwhelmed and maybe even a bit teary sometimes.

25:42.686 --> 25:44.087
But it's okay!

25:44.107 --> 25:46.008
Because you know what?

25:46.689 --> 25:47.389
I'm here for you.

25:47.409 --> 25:49.050
Fuwawa is here for you.

25:49.830 --> 25:51.131
We know you're doing your best.

25:53.277 --> 25:58.020
Just keep on going, and eventually, you'll be so much stronger from all of it.

25:58.901 --> 26:03.624
You know, it may be rough right now, but it's not always gonna be that way.

26:04.485 --> 26:05.666
No matter what it feels like.

26:07.147 --> 26:08.187
Everything will work out!

26:08.207 --> 26:09.548
I know it!

26:10.249 --> 26:11.229
GANBATTE DE!

26:11.710 --> 26:12.831
BAU BAU!

26:17.799 --> 26:18.399
It'll be good.

26:18.499 --> 26:20.501
You can do it, Ruffians!

26:20.621 --> 26:21.321
It'll be good, okay!

26:21.541 --> 26:23.482
BAU BAU, it will work out.

26:23.902 --> 26:24.363
Well then!

26:24.403 --> 26:31.346
Today, our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

26:32.327 --> 26:34.708
Aspen!

26:35.329 --> 26:35.849
Aspen!

26:36.009 --> 26:39.951
I don't know, that looks like a puppy who's about to cry really hard.

26:40.311 --> 26:41.512
Those ears!

26:41.612 --> 26:43.553
Right, look at those silly ears!

26:43.913 --> 26:45.394
The paws, too.

26:45.494 --> 26:46.635
He looks so happy!

26:47.495 --> 26:50.517
Just a happy puppy.

26:50.997 --> 27:01.663
Aspen is only three months old and apparently it's very difficult to take this picture of him because he's just go go go going everywhere.

27:02.624 --> 27:03.505
He's so fine!

27:03.525 --> 27:04.505
That's a puppy for you.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.426
That's a puppy, yeah.

27:06.446 --> 27:10.409
How do you think Aspen BAU BAUs?

27:19.242 --> 27:20.283
Just like that.

27:23.685 --> 27:27.688
I can see his little, his big feet moving around.

27:27.708 --> 27:28.889
Like what?

27:29.169 --> 27:29.710
Like that.

27:38.719 --> 27:43.541
Well, you know, Aspen is an absolutely adorable puppy!

27:43.981 --> 27:46.682
I think he's excited a hundred hours a day!

27:47.382 --> 27:48.163
Probably!

27:48.643 --> 27:53.885
But if you're not careful, that puppy dog tail might just wag on off.

27:54.765 --> 27:57.826
You have to make sure you keep an eye on him, okay?

27:57.906 --> 27:59.426
He wants to watch over her.

27:59.446 --> 28:01.107
It might be a little hard, though.

28:01.247 --> 28:05.469
I think, for now though, he's definitely the one that's taking you on walks so hard.

28:06.929 --> 28:08.270
BAU BAU!

28:09.591 --> 28:11.893
Asuka looks so fluffy too!

28:11.913 --> 28:13.214
Very fuzzy.

28:13.895 --> 28:14.756
Fuzzy ears.

28:15.376 --> 28:16.317
So cute!

28:17.038 --> 28:19.500
BAU BAU!

28:19.540 --> 28:20.581
Well done!

28:21.161 --> 28:26.446
Next we have... Today I went on a walk.

28:27.603 --> 28:33.689
Today's walk is... DE-DEN!

28:34.370 --> 28:41.236
A walk under the SAKURAN with pondering together with us!

28:41.316 --> 28:43.118
So nice!

28:43.138 --> 28:43.678
BAU BAU!

28:44.099 --> 28:48.883
We're so happy to be able to go for a walk together with you!

28:49.984 --> 28:50.765
Ohanami!

28:50.825 --> 28:53.548
We have Ohanami so much!

28:53.608 --> 28:56.410
Our first Hanami together too!

28:56.530 --> 28:58.072
It's beautiful!

28:58.612 --> 29:06.360
We're so happy that you're able to get out and enjoy all the blossoms, the colors, and the sun!

29:07.200 --> 29:11.402
And for the question of the day, we have De-den!

29:29.768 --> 29:31.269
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

29:31.309 --> 29:32.889
Good morning!

29:32.969 --> 29:36.830
It tends to be a lot of limited time only food in Japan.

29:36.910 --> 29:37.410
Yeah.

29:37.730 --> 29:43.851
It's a limited item that you've had once, but no matter how much you tried, you could never find it again.

29:43.871 --> 29:46.112
That's a sad story there.

29:46.632 --> 29:48.292
But FUWAMOCO!

29:48.512 --> 29:50.013
I make sure that never happens.

29:50.373 --> 29:55.194
Because I'm so weak to limited time items.

29:55.294 --> 29:55.934
It's really bad.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.417
I've never had this flavor before.

30:00.517 --> 30:07.161
So, you know, if it's limited time, then that's my time to enjoy it lots and lots.

30:07.602 --> 30:15.887
You know, it's hard because they're always so, like, cool and delicious looking, and I feel like I need to get it now, otherwise, you know, I'll never get another chance.

30:16.067 --> 30:16.247
Right?

30:16.267 --> 30:16.927
Like, it's fate.

30:17.408 --> 30:19.929
Our paths crossed in this supermarket.

30:20.370 --> 30:20.750
Right?

30:22.451 --> 30:23.932
But, uh...

30:24.628 --> 30:25.889
I can't think of anything, but...

30:43.905 --> 30:54.388
Well, there was, however, a really yummy grape-flavored black iced tea that the supermarket would always sell with a claim of limited time.

30:54.469 --> 30:56.989
Yeah, it was just a limited time only item.

30:57.490 --> 31:01.651
And you know, it was so good, I was really dreading the day that was one day.

31:02.151 --> 31:06.614
I couldn't get my paws on it again, so I made sure to get it pretty often.

31:06.674 --> 31:08.675
Moco-chan, you- I liked it!

31:08.715 --> 31:09.715
It wasn't very sweet.

31:09.735 --> 31:10.436
No complaints.

31:10.916 --> 31:11.196
Right?

31:11.276 --> 31:14.278
It was really, really refreshing and pretty addictive, too.

31:15.899 --> 31:22.163
But, you know, before we knew it, months and months and months and months went by.

31:22.183 --> 31:24.004
And it was still there.

31:25.391 --> 31:26.331
It's so hot.

31:26.351 --> 31:26.411
Why?

31:26.852 --> 31:27.332
I don't know.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.772
Was it really limited?

31:29.692 --> 31:32.313
Was it just maybe like a week or two that it wasn't there?

31:32.333 --> 31:34.134
Like on a stock level?

31:34.174 --> 31:37.335
When you think about it, everything is limited.

31:37.575 --> 31:37.995
Yeah.

31:38.675 --> 31:40.036
Happy for the morning hot.

31:40.316 --> 31:40.576
Yeah.

31:41.436 --> 31:46.418
But you know, the happy end to the story is, you know, we never had to say goodbye to it, you know?

31:47.270 --> 31:50.011
Just a little bit of a confused FUWAMOCO.

31:50.071 --> 31:51.112
Yeah, but happy.

31:51.912 --> 31:57.775
But I think otherwise, maybe we should do the Matcha Flavor Pondering.

31:57.795 --> 32:00.376
Those are always a nice surprise, right?

32:00.396 --> 32:03.457
They're sort of a surprise.

32:03.877 --> 32:05.098
But original.

32:06.619 --> 32:08.359
BAU BAU!

32:08.419 --> 32:15.723
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your questions, your doggies, your walks, your Pero Sightings.

32:16.650 --> 32:20.894
We're really, really lucky to have you here with us and be a part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

32:20.914 --> 32:22.556
Thank you so much!

32:22.716 --> 32:30.804
We're waiting for more submissions, so please use the hashtag FWMCMORNING!

32:30.844 --> 32:34.127
BAU BAU!

32:34.708 --> 32:37.411
Well, for our next stream coming up...

32:38.123 --> 32:43.549
We have, uh, uh, we have brunch with Advent over on the Risu Channel.

32:43.569 --> 32:46.912
So make sure you have brunch with us too, okay?

32:47.432 --> 32:52.538
But, uh, after that we also have FUWAMOCO Morning!

32:54.459 --> 32:56.642
You can always depend on it.

32:57.182 --> 33:00.105
And we're picking another gladiator schedule here.

33:00.145 --> 33:09.354
You can see we have a very big Rock n' Roar party coming up on Saturday, Ruffians!

33:11.356 --> 33:14.800
There's been a lot of really, really memorable Rock n' Roar parties.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.902
I'm sure there will also be another one.

33:17.412 --> 33:26.805
We have a big announcement, so we hope, Ruffians, that you'll be able to be there and cheer a bunch for us.

33:29.195 --> 33:31.236
Big, big announcement.

33:31.816 --> 33:36.597
We're looking forward to it!

33:36.637 --> 33:37.057
BAU BAU!

33:37.717 --> 33:40.318
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

33:40.458 --> 33:46.059
Once again, we just want you to know how thankful we are to be a part of your morning.

33:46.079 --> 33:48.440
Three times a week?

33:48.460 --> 33:48.560
Right!

33:48.900 --> 33:51.261
There's nothing to sneeze at.

33:51.581 --> 33:53.741
Thank you for letting us into your world.

33:53.761 --> 33:54.222
BAU BAU!

33:56.062 --> 34:03.709
Wow, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:04.059 --> 35:05.520
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

35:05.840 --> 35:06.780
BAU BAU!
