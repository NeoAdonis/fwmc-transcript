00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.090
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.007
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:21.089
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.209
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.031
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:29.892
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:32.053
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:33.254
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:40.941
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:47.146
Thank you for joining us today for our 78th episode!

00:05:47.286 --> 00:05:51.369
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.093
I feel like any day we're gonna hit 100.

00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:58.375
Any day now!

00:05:58.455 --> 00:05:59.435
And that scares me.

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:02.370
Good good!

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:06.534
BAU BAU!

00:06:06.554 --> 00:06:12.421
Well, we're not gonna hit 100 episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning just yet.

00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:12.981
Not yet.

00:06:13.662 --> 00:06:18.868
And well, there might be some Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today on our subreddit.

00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:29.081
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:29.842
A.K.A.

00:06:29.963 --> 00:06:30.844
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:34.469
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:42.094
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:42.454 --> 00:06:44.515
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:48.298
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:52.880
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.601
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:59.343
Is your morning good so far, Ruffian?

00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:08.426
Oh, I see all the hashtag hashtags as usual, so I think it's off to a good hashtag hashtag after FWMCMORNING.

00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:09.466
Is that how it works?

00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:10.947
I don't know.

00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:13.008
BAU BAU!

00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:13.868
BAU BAU!

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:17.489
Well, Moco-chan, what kind of news do we have this morning?

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.411
Well... First off,

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:26.991
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:28.332 --> 00:07:29.353
I thought you wanna know.

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:31.335
I'll break the news to you quickly.

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:36.821
This is the report we got, Ruffians, okay?

00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:38.022
Prepare yourself.

00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.150
Don't be tricked, okay?

00:07:50.030 --> 00:08:01.299
Even if you know you find what looks like a cute little puppy abandoned at the side of the road in an old wet cardboard box, don't give in, okay?

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.280
That's not a puppy, Ruffians.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.921
That's Pero.

00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.365
A very, very nasty demon dog.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:13.188
No matter what kind of puppy dog eyes he gives you,

00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:16.570
You really, really don't want to, okay?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.170
No.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:26.774
Ruffians, do you not remember what happened to those brothers many FUWAMOCO mornings back when they spotted Pero?

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:28.114
Do you remember?

00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:29.815
The brothers.

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:30.535
I do.

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:31.956
I remember.

00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:34.116
That was a good warning.

00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:35.177
Yeah.

00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:36.830
No!

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:40.556
Oh no, you have to remember.

00:08:40.876 --> 00:08:42.259
You're in trouble, okay?

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:44.262
No, you don't want to end up like that.

00:08:44.322 --> 00:08:46.084
Yeah, you remember and you see that.

00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:49.192
What happened to you, okay?

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:53.136
Okay, so if you decide to take him in, that could be you.

00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:53.836
That could?

00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:54.997
Yeah.

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:56.899
And that would be bad, okay?

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:57.380
That would?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.000
Right!

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.362
So, don't, okay?

00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:01.623
Just don't.

00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:04.326
Really don't want you.

00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:05.967
Really, really don't.

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:06.628
Okay.

00:09:07.348 --> 00:09:08.930
I guarantee you, Ruffians!

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.790
Guarantee it!

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.293
It has the FUWAMOCO guarantee, okay?

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:12.473
Yeah.

00:09:14.827 --> 00:09:16.149
We're FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:09:34.963 --> 00:09:37.044
Listen, use your ears.

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:40.844
BAU BAU!

00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:44.425
Well, Ruffians!

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:47.226
What else about you?

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:54.668
We wanted to share a scoop that we got from a Ruffian who's very infamous in the knowhow.

00:09:55.308 --> 00:09:59.432
Thank you, TK-san, for the impeccable journalism!

00:09:59.692 --> 00:10:00.212
Impeccable!

00:10:01.473 --> 00:10:12.382
Well, it seems like Advent's first original song, Rebellion, premiered on a debut six months ago.

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:18.007
It has now hit 3 million views on the official hololive English YouTube channel!

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.808
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:29.597
Thank you so much to all the Ruffians and Adventrix who've been listening to it over and over and over.

00:10:29.737 --> 00:10:31.899
It's a very special song to us.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:35.822
You know, it's filled with lots of hopes and dreams.

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:39.866
Also, Mama Puppy loves it too, okay?

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:42.788
Mama Puppy seal of approval.

00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:43.589
Exactly.

00:10:46.152 --> 00:10:54.384
FUWAMOCO, we really hope that one day maybe we can sing it for you live all together as Advent.

00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:56.107
All five of us!

00:10:56.187 --> 00:10:57.429
What do you think of that, Ruffian?

00:10:58.769 --> 00:10:59.269
Fun!

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:02.271
Fire, fire, light the fire!

00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.671
Dance, dance, dance!

00:11:04.992 --> 00:11:05.752
We'll be fun.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:15.216
We'll have to look forward to that day and just continue to listen to Rebellion more and more and more.

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:16.256
Be prepared, okay?

00:11:16.756 --> 00:11:17.297
BAU BAU!

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.257
Get ready to dance!

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:23.578
BAU BAU!

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:30.222
Yeah, atarashii sekai e kitto.

00:11:30.262 --> 00:11:31.523
New world.

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:31.983
Right.

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.604
Ruffians!

00:11:34.185 --> 00:11:39.088
I actually, actually, I actually have some happy, happy news!

00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:42.890
But, well, it's not for me.

00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:44.632
Moco-chan.

00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:47.033
Happy news for you, right?

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:49.275
Wow.

00:11:52.643 --> 00:12:04.071
For the first time, instead of making Rat King tea, you know with my leftover tea bags, there was a lot of them.

00:12:05.172 --> 00:12:09.314
I threw them all out and started the Ruffians while I did it!

00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:10.755
I did Ruffians!

00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:11.976
I did for you!

00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:14.218
I tossed them all in the trash!

00:12:14.238 --> 00:12:15.118
I saw!

00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:19.021
You know, I also figured,

00:12:20.444 --> 00:12:25.308
We might have gotten a bit strange since the pile had gotten pretty big.

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:26.889
It was really big.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:37.278
And you know, we still have a lot of new tea bags left on the pantry too, so I thought maybe this time it will be okay.

00:12:37.638 --> 00:12:38.078
This time?

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:39.319
This time.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.342
Are you proud of me, Ruffians?

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:44.380
Wait, Moco-chan!

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.905
I thought that you said that there'll be no more Rat King tea, right?

00:12:51.766 --> 00:12:52.186
This time.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.352
Pride!

00:13:00.773 --> 00:13:01.413
Pride!

00:13:02.795 --> 00:13:03.295
Super pride!

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:05.016
BAU BAU!

00:13:05.757 --> 00:13:06.838
BAU BAU.

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.363
BAU BAU!

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.809
Good announcement, huh?

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:17.250
It's a start.

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:24.959
BAU BAU!

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:33.621
Well, Ruffians, that aside, I guess, next week is Valentine's Day!

00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:41.782
And, well, as you might know, FUWAMOCO, we really enjoy spending the holidays together with you.

00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:43.423
I'm surprising you too!

00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:44.603
Surprises.

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:45.083
Surprises.

00:13:45.183 --> 00:13:47.523
It's gonna be a fun holiday.

00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:47.684
Fun.

00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:47.844
Fun.

00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:49.204
Holiday surprises.

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:49.404
Fun.

00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:52.645
Holidays!

00:13:53.225 --> 00:14:02.188
Oh, you know, we've been working on some special things behind the scenes for it.

00:14:03.068 --> 00:14:10.211
You know, we're pretty excited, but also pretty nervous too!

00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:15.452
Yeah, because you know, it'll be our first Valentine's Day together.

00:14:16.212 --> 00:14:16.513
But,

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:21.822
Ruffians.

00:14:23.883 --> 00:14:40.115
I do want you to know that officially, you know us, FUWAMOCO, we will not be making our ASMR debut during this holiday period.

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:42.237
Understood.

00:14:47.864 --> 00:14:48.724
Okay, Ruffians.

00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:53.047
Let's- Let's all say a big- Oh, no!

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:53.987
Together, okay.

00:14:54.007 --> 00:14:55.808
Alright, get out of the system.

00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:56.328
Yeah.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:57.249
Okay.

00:14:57.289 --> 00:14:57.749
Yeah.

00:14:57.969 --> 00:14:58.930
Okay, Ruffians.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.131
Three, two, one.

00:15:03.852 --> 00:15:06.914
Oh, no!

00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:09.115
Yeah.

00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:09.735
Too bad.

00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:10.616
Yeah.

00:15:10.656 --> 00:15:10.936
Wait!

00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:11.536
Huh?

00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:12.557
What?

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:12.957
Wait.

00:15:13.277 --> 00:15:13.497
What?

00:15:13.658 --> 00:15:13.998
One day.

00:15:14.858 --> 00:15:15.058
One day?

00:15:15.078 --> 00:15:15.519
Really?

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:16.159
Yeah.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.044
This year!

00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:22.247
We will make our ASMR debut.

00:15:23.087 --> 00:15:23.388
Maybe.

00:15:24.388 --> 00:15:24.829
This year.

00:15:25.849 --> 00:15:28.271
Today not today.

00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.212
Not today.

00:15:30.613 --> 00:15:31.854
Not tomorrow.

00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:33.635
Maybe one day.

00:15:34.075 --> 00:15:34.876
Maybe this year.

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:40.759
Yeah, but Ruffians, you know, if you're a little sad about it, that's okay.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:43.321
That's okay, it's okay to be sad sometimes.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:47.184
Maybe we can suggest to you our Valentine's voice pack.

00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:48.745
Right?

00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:51.427
This should make you fluffy and fuzzy again, right?

00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:51.907
Right!

00:15:51.927 --> 00:15:58.451
At the very least, you know, our Valentine's week, I don't know, is looking pretty busy.

00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:03.094
So, please make time for us if you can, okay?

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:03.935
Got it!

00:16:06.687 --> 00:16:07.489
BAU BAU!

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:08.531
BAU BAU!

00:16:08.632 --> 00:16:09.634
BAU BAU!

00:16:16.658 --> 00:16:18.459
Wow, Ruffians.

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:23.340
On the topic of voice packs and all those kinds of things.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:39.184
You know, we thought, especially with Advent's 6th birthday anniversary, and you know, our birthdays, and we have Valentine's coming up, and much more, that we thought you might be feeling a little bit overwhelmed.

00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:41.145
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:42.265
I am too, actually.

00:16:42.445 --> 00:16:45.946
You know, cause all of a sudden, there's been

00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.792
A lot of FUWAMOCO news.

00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:49.573
A lot!

00:16:49.893 --> 00:16:50.353
Right!

00:16:50.814 --> 00:16:51.614
All of a sudden!

00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:53.155
It feels like within a week!

00:16:53.536 --> 00:16:53.876
Right!

00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:54.436
Right!

00:16:54.877 --> 00:16:55.137
Right!

00:16:55.157 --> 00:16:57.719
Yeah, you are definitely- We're very happy!

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.180
We're very excited!

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.920
Very excited!

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.341
It makes sense, you know?

00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:01.901
Yeah.

00:17:01.981 --> 00:17:02.522
But, uh...

00:17:04.338 --> 00:17:07.101
Guys, we were thinking about you.

00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:11.005
And thought that it might just be a bit confusing.

00:17:11.025 --> 00:17:14.869
About, you know, what to get and what to prioritize, you know.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.952
We realize it's difficult and it's all different.

00:17:17.992 --> 00:17:20.114
Yeah, there's a lot of different types of merch.

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.789
We wanted to let you know our thoughts about each item.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.730
Thinking not only from our level of excitement for things.

00:17:40.615 --> 00:17:48.483
But you know, also taking into factor the type of merchandise, the pre-order window, limited stock of each item, and what not, you know.

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:52.907
Not only from our perspective, but from our fan perspective too, okay?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.334
You don't know that this is something that we wanted to do.

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:05.979
We're excited and we wanted to help you out with everything so you don't miss out.

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:07.560
No skip ad, okay?

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.401
We're excited.

00:18:08.501 --> 00:18:09.902
We wanted to do this, okay?

00:18:11.063 --> 00:18:18.010
You know, also, we're sure that there's so much that you don't even know out there that's available, okay?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.552
It's all just all of a sudden.

00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:22.273
Watch us!

00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:25.695
We're gonna go through it together, okay?

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.518
We broke it down, okay?

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:34.322
Yeah, because you know, FUWAMOCO, we're really a big fan!

00:18:34.722 --> 00:18:37.164
Please let us help you out, okay?

00:18:37.644 --> 00:18:40.066
Let's go do it all here.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:45.809
First, we have our birthday merch!

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:50.772
If you have not heard about it, we are very excited!

00:18:50.952 --> 00:18:51.973
It's our birthday merch.

00:18:52.293 --> 00:18:54.834
Yeah, our first birthday merch ever.

00:18:54.854 --> 00:18:58.856
First up is Fuwawa here, in case you couldn't tell.

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:05.520
I have my duolude acrylic paddle with a beautiful illustration by Miwabe Sakura-sensei.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.060
And this is

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.723
Moco-chan's is a little different.

00:19:08.903 --> 00:19:11.386
We're twins, but a little different.

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:13.028
It also comes with a Ruffian, plus she's so cute!

00:19:25.202 --> 00:19:27.284
We're very excited about them!

00:19:27.684 --> 00:19:28.145
Okay.

00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:31.488
Big recommendation.

00:19:31.528 --> 00:19:33.309
Like, oh, I can fit it on my desk.

00:19:33.329 --> 00:19:33.409
Nope!

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.931
He is big.

00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:35.351
He's big.

00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:36.652
He's a big... Good to hug!

00:19:36.752 --> 00:19:36.872
Yeah.

00:19:37.073 --> 00:19:37.233
Okay.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.378
And then we have my t-shirt.

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.240
You know, the spring's coming up, the summer's coming up.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.342
A good way to say I like Fuwawa.

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:48.682
Right?

00:19:48.802 --> 00:19:51.404
But it's not too, like, in your face.

00:19:51.604 --> 00:19:54.586
And then we have a very cute acrylic keychain.

00:19:54.907 --> 00:20:01.011
You know, maybe you have, like, a cute new bag you want to accessorize.

00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:02.773
This would be the perfect thing.

00:20:03.793 --> 00:20:06.775
And well, we also have a voice prank.

00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:09.136
A voice adventure with me, Fuwawa.

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:12.398
Don't you want to go on a voice adventure with Fuwawa?

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:16.061
And because it's English and Japanese, so you know double the fun.

00:20:21.424 --> 00:20:23.946
I have my acrylic diorama stand.

00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:25.106
Diorama stand.

00:20:25.967 --> 00:20:30.090
Whichever one you want.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:36.734
And the illustration is by Aoki Ume-sensei!

00:20:36.774 --> 00:20:37.935
You might recognize.

00:20:38.435 --> 00:20:40.317
Hidamari Sketch.

00:20:40.737 --> 00:20:41.858
Madoka Magikai.

00:20:43.536 --> 00:20:44.817
I'm really excited.

00:20:44.938 --> 00:20:46.199
I'm not gonna cry this time.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.703
Big recommendation show!

00:20:49.723 --> 00:20:50.424
Tickets for BAU!

00:20:50.504 --> 00:20:51.265
Ruffian plushie!

00:20:55.836 --> 00:20:58.658
Big, big, big, big, big, big recommendation, okay!

00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:00.859
Really, really big, okay!

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.641
You'll hear more later.

00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:05.142
And then my T-shirt!

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:05.583
T-shirt!

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:08.985
You know, this is also FUWAMOCO's first T-shirt, right?

00:21:09.225 --> 00:21:12.147
I mean, we had the Halloween one, but that was with Abyss.

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.668
But this is just mine.

00:21:13.768 --> 00:21:14.228
Why?

00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:23.915
So you know, I know there's three days of the week, you know, FUWAMOCO, but you could wear Fuwawa shirt, Mococo shirt, and then

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:25.416
Wednesday is Advent.

00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:32.080
Oh, so Friday Fuwawa shirt, Wednesday Advent shirt, and then Monday Mococo shirt!

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.261
Exactly!

00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:36.143
And then, my kitchen!

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:40.285
You know it could be very cute on a bed along with Fuwawas too.

00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:41.686
Double accessories!

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:43.888
You know, maybe you'll have a best friend.

00:21:43.908 --> 00:21:46.890
Twiddies!

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.012
And then my play spot!

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:51.993
You wanna cook some stuff together?

00:21:52.013 --> 00:21:52.133
Donuts!

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:56.393
Maybe a little secret, Ruffians?

00:21:58.658 --> 00:22:00.862
I don't like the oil, so I need your help, okay?

00:22:01.636 --> 00:22:02.136
BAU BAU!

00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:04.658
And it's in English and Japanese too, okay?

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:09.381
We cannot stress how excited we are about our birthday merch.

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:09.962
But next!

00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:18.407
Like a day early, it was announced with a 6 month anniversary Advent Happy New Year celebration merch!

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:21.769
And for this, we have the Tapestry.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.130
Very cool.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.292
It's good if you like a bit more of a hardcore looking.

00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:31.196
FUWAMOCO, we're cute, fluffy, fuzzy, but this is more on the

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:33.537
And then we also have the metal keychains.

00:22:33.558 --> 00:22:35.619
Again, if you want us to protect your keys by, uh...

00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:05.403
Maybe the acrylic one is a bit too white for you.

00:23:06.024 --> 00:23:07.365
This is heavy.

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:08.706
Hardcore.

00:23:08.726 --> 00:23:10.928
Everyone's gonna question you.

00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:12.410
And I forgot to mention!

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.392
So, our birthday goods!

00:23:15.032 --> 00:23:15.773
Important.

00:23:16.154 --> 00:23:18.436
Sales stop March 4th.

00:23:19.617 --> 00:23:22.940
Now, we have our limited birthday goods, but they already sold out.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.082
But the regular sales stopped.

00:23:25.743 --> 00:23:27.124
in about a month.

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.805
And same with the advent goods.

00:23:29.245 --> 00:23:30.306
Sales also stop.

00:23:30.887 --> 00:23:31.647
March 4th.

00:23:32.107 --> 00:23:32.568
JST.

00:23:55.843 --> 00:23:58.624
Yeah, there's still time, but just don't forget, okay?

00:23:58.724 --> 00:23:58.904
Yeah.

00:23:59.145 --> 00:23:59.925
FUWAMOCO!

00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:06.488
When we're excited about something, but then we get a bit too excited and we're like, okay, well, I'll do that soon.

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:08.989
Especially with purchases, we forget.

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.709
I like to put everything off until it's gone.

00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:13.169
That is what I do.

00:24:13.189 --> 00:24:15.450
Don't be like FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.891
I don't want you to be disappointed, okay?

00:24:17.911 --> 00:24:24.894
And next, we have our Valentine's Day goods.

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:28.115
Now these are a bit different, because there's no order period.

00:24:28.776 --> 00:24:32.117
They are limited until they're sold out.

00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:44.243
Which, well, if any Ruffians, if you're interested in making like a ita bag, so you have a whole bunch of the badges, the cat badges, well, unfortunately, FUWAMOCO's individual... But happily!

00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:46.005
Yeah, happily!

00:24:46.085 --> 00:24:47.286
Thank you!

00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:49.468
The individual badges are now sold out.

00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:50.689
But, dare I say!

00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:57.132
So you can still get them, but if you're thinking of making an itabag, you might have a lot of sets from here on out.

00:24:57.152 --> 00:24:58.273
A lot of hand towels.

00:24:58.453 --> 00:24:59.313
Hippopo sets.

00:24:59.333 --> 00:24:59.753
BAU BAU!

00:24:59.853 --> 00:25:01.254
BAU BAU!

00:25:01.274 --> 00:25:01.774
Thank you!

00:25:01.814 --> 00:25:05.176
Yeah, maybe, you know, you want to give hand towels to every family member?

00:25:05.516 --> 00:25:07.477
Well, you could get a lot of sets then, right?

00:25:07.497 --> 00:25:08.158
I like Advent.

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:09.058
I like Advent!

00:25:09.138 --> 00:25:12.700
So yeah, these are a bit different.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.441
There's not a sales period that ends.

00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:15.821
It's just when they're gone, they're gone.

00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:18.062
They're gone, they're gone.

00:25:18.763 --> 00:25:19.043
But!

00:25:19.183 --> 00:25:20.644
More importantly!

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:26.828
We have a Valentine's voice pack!

00:25:27.668 --> 00:25:36.410
You know, it came out at the same time as our birthdays, so... You know, we haven't really talked about it too much, but... We were tired of it!

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.591
We did!

00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.911
And you know, we worked on the script ourselves.

00:25:41.431 --> 00:25:44.052
I think it came out cutely.

00:25:44.072 --> 00:25:48.253
We have a crazy bunch of lines.

00:25:53.662 --> 00:26:03.767
I'm sure there's a lot of Ruffians saving it for Valentine's Day.

00:26:03.807 --> 00:26:05.387
That makes sense.

00:26:05.788 --> 00:26:11.990
We're really working hard on voice packs, you know, as a way to grow, a way to challenge ourselves.

00:26:14.972 --> 00:26:16.553
If you could, we'd really like that!

00:26:16.614 --> 00:26:19.896
Okay, we're doing our best.

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.898
Moco-chan, does this have a sales period?

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:25.041
It ends on April 8th, okay?

00:26:25.261 --> 00:26:27.183
You might think the voice packs don't.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:28.324
They don't stop.

00:26:28.584 --> 00:26:30.566
But this one ends April 8th.

00:26:31.106 --> 00:26:39.453
So if you're interested in a bit of a different, Valentines-y side to FUWAMOCO, this might be for you, okay?

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:42.479
Continuing!

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.540
Continuing!

00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.742
At the New Year's!

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:50.085
We had Advent New Year's merchandise.

00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:54.808
We had our voice drama, a very huge one of New Year's.

00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:59.312
And we also had the hololive closet acrylic stand.

00:26:59.772 --> 00:27:04.555
Now, I would say that these are very high priority, but

00:27:05.973 --> 00:27:08.415
They are available for the foreseeable future.

00:27:08.715 --> 00:27:11.517
Not limited, not a certain sales period.

00:27:12.017 --> 00:27:15.519
So, you can pick them up when you want, I believe.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.221
Okay!

00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:19.302
It's too much!

00:27:19.422 --> 00:27:21.603
I know that's why we're trying to help you, okay?

00:27:21.704 --> 00:27:23.024
I'm excited!

00:27:23.044 --> 00:27:25.866
They get restocked, I believe so!

00:27:25.886 --> 00:27:28.368
I'm not certain, but I believe so!

00:27:29.229 --> 00:27:35.533
But if you haven't picked up a birthday merch, and you haven't picked up these, well... It's a good opportunity, right?

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.368
But, there is also... Ah, mine.

00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:42.190
But also!

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.011
I got Moco-chan!

00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:43.291
Also!

00:27:47.987 --> 00:27:49.728
What is this?

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:56.051
FUWAMOCO, we're participating in the Lantern Festival in Kainan!

00:27:56.251 --> 00:28:00.833
In case you haven't seen, we shared it on Twitter, but we haven't really shared it much elsewhere.

00:28:00.853 --> 00:28:01.994
It hasn't started yet.

00:28:02.054 --> 00:28:03.314
It has not started.

00:28:03.494 --> 00:28:08.717
It starts February 24th until March 10th, so two week period.

00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:11.658
There is a lot of merch in there!

00:28:11.678 --> 00:28:13.159
Really exciting merch!

00:28:13.419 --> 00:28:17.561
I'm only gonna show you a couple items that we're very very excited about, but there is

00:28:19.113 --> 00:28:22.495
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:30.553
Maybe, maybe.

00:28:31.554 --> 00:28:37.716
But FUWAMOCO, together with the senpai, we're very cute.

00:28:37.796 --> 00:28:39.296
Very styled, right?

00:28:39.336 --> 00:28:41.777
We have the full print t-shirt.

00:28:41.837 --> 00:28:44.618
And then, we also have plushies.

00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:46.158
Plushies!

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:47.119
Look!

00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:50.099
Look at us in our little dragon costume.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.260
Very, very cute.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.980
We've seen stuff.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.221
They're very, very cute.

00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:56.381
Okay.

00:28:56.782 --> 00:28:58.042
Very, very cute.

00:29:00.253 --> 00:29:02.574
And then, we got charms!

00:29:02.654 --> 00:29:03.355
Charms!

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:05.956
Like, a goal, a debut, right, Moco-chan?

00:29:05.976 --> 00:29:06.576
Yeah.

00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:08.738
We're happy!

00:29:08.918 --> 00:29:09.658
And they're so cute!

00:29:09.758 --> 00:29:10.458
They're so cute!

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:11.719
Blue and pink.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.000
Yeah.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.921
Right.

00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:18.603
And then also, this one's surprising.

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:19.603
We were surprised.

00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:21.524
Candy!

00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:22.825
Candies!

00:29:22.905 --> 00:29:25.707
But it's not just, you know, not just packaging.

00:29:27.068 --> 00:29:27.868
It's our faces.

00:29:28.128 --> 00:29:28.689
Our faces.

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:29.569
In the candy.

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:33.430
I wonder what- Oh, can you compare our flavors to a senpai?

00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:34.851
I wonder.

00:29:34.871 --> 00:29:36.211
Yes!

00:29:36.832 --> 00:29:37.352
Candy!

00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:37.992
Candy!

00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:39.313
Like actual candy!

00:29:39.353 --> 00:29:39.693
Yes!

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.082
It's very exciting!

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:46.944
You can't eat FUWAMOCO just this occasion.

00:29:47.324 --> 00:29:54.209
It's very limited and might be difficult to get at the Ruffians.

00:29:54.649 --> 00:30:00.693
If you can't actually go to the festival, well, you might need to ask a friend to go and get it for you.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.695
And that might be the hard part.

00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:09.658
There's a lot of other items too, so you'll have to check it out.

00:30:09.678 --> 00:30:12.158
We will tweet more about it after FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:14.739
It hasn't started yet, don't worry.

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.960
You still have time to find your friend, okay?

00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.544
That is everything!

00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:23.144
Our merch!

00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:24.186
The merch!

00:30:24.787 --> 00:30:26.609
It all came out really suddenly!

00:30:26.829 --> 00:30:28.571
It's overwhelming, huh?

00:30:28.752 --> 00:30:31.295
So, if you're still feeling overwhelmed, here we go.

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:31.976
Summary.

00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:35.260
We have a priority score here.

00:30:37.245 --> 00:30:39.286
So, first, birthday.

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:42.948
If we could do 10 stars, we would do 10 stars, okay?

00:30:42.988 --> 00:30:43.708
We could do 100?

00:30:44.048 --> 00:30:45.969
We would do 100 stars, okay?

00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:51.371
Because it's limited until March 4th, you know?

00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:53.231
It's a small period.

00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:56.373
It's FUWAMOCO's first birthday match!

00:30:56.413 --> 00:30:58.353
We put a lot of love into it.

00:30:58.894 --> 00:31:01.395
I hope that you'll love it too.

00:31:03.098 --> 00:31:06.000
And after that, we have Advent's 6 month print.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.562
It also ends March 4th DST.

00:31:09.922 --> 00:31:13.143
Heavily recommended to those Adventrix maybe.

00:31:13.203 --> 00:31:15.465
Don't you have multiple OSHI with an Advent?

00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:16.525
Go for it.

00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:17.986
Valentine's!

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:19.627
Also very good.

00:31:19.927 --> 00:31:20.868
Also limited.

00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:22.569
Don't forget, okay?

00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:24.349
Put the Valentine's voice pack!

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.351
We're really working hard.

00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:29.272
We will be really happy, okay?

00:31:31.173 --> 00:31:32.794
And I think it's cute.

00:31:33.114 --> 00:31:33.574
It's cute.

00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:34.894
I think it's cute!

00:31:34.954 --> 00:31:38.976
And you know, Ruffians if you're a little bit like, oh but shipping!

00:31:39.876 --> 00:31:40.536
Waste Pack.

00:31:41.136 --> 00:31:41.856
No shipping!

00:31:45.178 --> 00:31:47.558
And then, Advent New Year!

00:31:47.938 --> 00:31:54.080
Very exciting, but you know, it's there for a while for this foreseeable future, so you don't need to rush.

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:55.501
Low priority.

00:31:56.201 --> 00:31:57.342
Lantern Festival!

00:31:57.362 --> 00:31:58.783
Really cool merch!

00:31:58.803 --> 00:32:00.004
Really cool, really cute!

00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:01.945
Might be hard to get your paws on.

00:32:01.965 --> 00:32:03.386
Okay.

00:32:04.327 --> 00:32:07.209
So, the final, the final, what is it?

00:32:07.249 --> 00:32:08.029
Conclusion!

00:32:08.189 --> 00:32:13.813
If your wallet could is really crying, and you can only get one thing.

00:32:13.913 --> 00:32:15.674
Yeah, maybe you've never bought merch before.

00:32:15.734 --> 00:32:16.715
It's a bit scary.

00:32:16.915 --> 00:32:18.496
What would we recommend, Moco-chan?

00:32:19.277 --> 00:32:20.838
Ruffian plushies!

00:32:21.078 --> 00:32:21.778
Okay.

00:32:22.579 --> 00:32:23.620
Talk to Marnie-chan.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.060
Yeah.

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:27.120
I don't know how many we are ordering.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.243
Mari-chan said, no FUWAMOCO, you need to order your own.

00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:35.584
We can't get that many extras.

00:32:37.264 --> 00:32:37.885
Makes sense.

00:32:37.965 --> 00:32:39.265
It's too many extras.

00:32:39.745 --> 00:32:40.206
Okay.

00:32:40.226 --> 00:32:42.847
You don't want to hug?

00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:43.507
It makes sense.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:44.948
It makes sense.

00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:45.708
It's too much.

00:32:45.768 --> 00:32:48.589
After the first one is tired.

00:32:48.609 --> 00:32:49.690
It's too many, okay.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.970
Okay.

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:54.898
I hope you understand.

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:55.379
Also!

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.763
After the Ruffian plays his birthday, okay?

00:32:59.803 --> 00:32:59.983
No!

00:33:00.383 --> 00:33:00.903
Birthday!

00:33:03.386 --> 00:33:04.406
Very exciting.

00:33:04.987 --> 00:33:05.788
Very exciting.

00:33:05.948 --> 00:33:08.670
Do you feel a little less overwhelmed, Ruffians?

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.873
Why do you just feel overwhelmed like I yelled at you for a long time, huh?

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.681
It was a great reminder!

00:33:22.721 --> 00:33:24.521
We did it for your sake, okay?

00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:25.101
Thank you.

00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:26.582
And because I'm excited!

00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:29.303
BAU BAU!

00:33:29.443 --> 00:33:33.984
This was FUWAMOCO's comprehensive merch priority guide.

00:33:34.144 --> 00:33:34.584
Okay.

00:33:34.884 --> 00:33:36.645
BAU BAU!

00:33:38.105 --> 00:33:39.726
Mococo's stressing you out!

00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:41.566
I'm not stressing you out!

00:33:42.627 --> 00:33:47.788
But... Wow, if Moco-chan stressed you out... Wow, Moco-chan.

00:33:48.248 --> 00:33:49.969
Can you fix the situation?

00:33:52.017 --> 00:33:57.599
Uh, I can't promise anything, but I'll do my best, okay?

00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:02.340
Ruffians!

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.021
You know what day it is.

00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:10.302
Today is Night Time of Week!

00:34:11.642 --> 00:34:20.205
It's time for you to lend me your ear, because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:34:21.237 --> 00:34:21.677
Good one, right?

00:34:22.077 --> 00:34:22.678
Good one, right?

00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:27.401
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:34:28.861 --> 00:34:29.822
Ruffians!

00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:33.204
Hello!

00:34:35.665 --> 00:34:42.709
I know it's still just the morning and that the day is just starting, but I wanted to see it anyway.

00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:47.292
Good job on all your hard work recently!

00:34:47.312 --> 00:34:48.413
Okay.

00:34:48.433 --> 00:34:50.394
Hmm.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.260
Yeah!

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.301
All your heartbreak!

00:34:55.501 --> 00:34:58.201
Everyday, yeah!

00:34:58.562 --> 00:34:58.922
I know.

00:34:59.822 --> 00:35:00.202
I know!

00:35:00.762 --> 00:35:02.282
Even when you take a bit of a break!

00:35:03.103 --> 00:35:04.323
That's just a breather!

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.564
Rest is just as important as your work.

00:35:08.184 --> 00:35:08.544
You know?

00:35:09.484 --> 00:35:10.884
So don't deny yourself it!

00:35:12.305 --> 00:35:19.667
And recently, uh... You've treated us, FUWAMOCO, sorta like

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.661
Princesses.

00:35:26.282 --> 00:35:26.802
Why?

00:35:28.143 --> 00:35:29.644
Cuz it was our birthdays!

00:35:31.285 --> 00:35:33.866
So... How about it?

00:35:35.027 --> 00:35:37.449
It's time to treat yourself like royalty!

00:35:38.549 --> 00:35:40.270
Every now and again too, okay?

00:35:40.971 --> 00:35:41.171
But...

00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:47.827
You know, you have to take care of yourself and your heart before you can take care of others, okay?

00:35:49.348 --> 00:35:55.433
So, let's make sure to keep ourselves happy so that we can help those around us too.

00:35:56.373 --> 00:35:56.774
Got it?

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:59.396
Keep doing your best!

00:35:59.936 --> 00:36:00.857
I know you can do it!

00:36:01.558 --> 00:36:02.959
We're both here to help you, okay?

00:36:03.439 --> 00:36:04.220
We're here with you!

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.861
Ganbatte ne!

00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:07.362
BAU BAU!

00:36:14.818 --> 00:36:16.679
Don't feel overwhelmed, Ruffians!

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.439
Keep on going!

00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:20.941
Did that count as me yelling at you still?

00:36:22.362 --> 00:36:22.882
I hope not.

00:36:22.902 --> 00:36:23.762
BAU BAU!

00:36:23.802 --> 00:36:30.066
Well, let's see who the Doggie of the Day is today!

00:36:30.086 --> 00:36:34.268
Our Doggie of the Day is De-den!

00:36:34.288 --> 00:36:37.470
The Doggie of the Day is me!

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:37.890
BAU BAU!

00:36:41.392 --> 00:36:45.894
This must be the biggest Doggie of the Day we've ever had, huh?

00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:48.916
Is this one of those mastiffs?

00:36:48.936 --> 00:36:50.337
Or a St.

00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:51.017
Bernard's?

00:36:51.217 --> 00:36:52.458
Maybe, maybe.

00:36:52.758 --> 00:36:53.859
It could be!

00:36:54.339 --> 00:37:02.763
Well, you know, even though Max is on the bigger size, he still loves playing together with his family outside.

00:37:02.864 --> 00:37:03.704
Very nice!

00:37:03.784 --> 00:37:06.646
And actually, he loves his veggies too!

00:37:07.346 --> 00:37:09.167
It's good to be health conscious, doggie, huh?

00:37:09.187 --> 00:37:09.787
Very good.

00:37:09.807 --> 00:37:11.347
It's good to be health conscious.

00:37:11.827 --> 00:37:14.528
Yeah, great day.

00:37:14.568 --> 00:37:17.029
Well, how does Max BAU BAU?

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.070
BAU!

00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:22.951
BAU!

00:37:24.171 --> 00:37:25.332
BAU!

00:37:26.352 --> 00:37:28.193
BAU!

00:37:28.453 --> 00:37:29.053
That may be.

00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:33.558
It's a bit of a different BAU BAU than FUWAMOCO, huh?

00:37:33.578 --> 00:37:35.558
He is very big, so... Yeah.

00:37:35.878 --> 00:37:36.378
Makes sense.

00:37:36.498 --> 00:37:39.599
Yeah, big BAU BAU.

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:40.739
Yeah, Max?

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:43.600
Max is bigger than the other doggies.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.540
But he doesn't let that get in his way of having fun!

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.941
No, he's gonna have fun!

00:37:48.981 --> 00:37:51.801
Yeah, he loves his family more than anything!

00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:54.102
And he's such a gentle soul!

00:37:54.442 --> 00:37:55.382
You know, I think...

00:37:56.082 --> 00:37:59.224
I think he'll even share his veggies with you, too.

00:37:59.244 --> 00:38:00.385
That's nice.

00:38:00.525 --> 00:38:01.066
Yeah.

00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:08.190
You know, he wants you to be healthy and happy for many years to come, too, so... Nice.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.151
Kaimasu.

00:38:09.972 --> 00:38:12.513
BAU BAU!

00:38:12.894 --> 00:38:14.875
BAU BAU!

00:38:15.255 --> 00:38:20.359
Next, Moco-chan, for our Today I Went On A Walk, we have De-den!

00:38:23.494 --> 00:38:25.055
Sunset.

00:38:25.135 --> 00:38:27.417
It's beautiful.

00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:31.300
And such a wonderful friend you have too!

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.381
Right.

00:38:33.881 --> 00:38:37.242
Please keep them close by your side, okay?

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:38.583
That's a good thing.

00:38:39.743 --> 00:38:43.844
We hope that you can enjoy even more lovely walks together.

00:38:44.165 --> 00:38:45.085
Right, a walk!

00:38:45.165 --> 00:38:45.945
This is a walk!

00:38:45.965 --> 00:38:47.726
This is their walk!

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:48.946
Oh my gosh.

00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:50.367
Too pretty.

00:38:50.727 --> 00:38:52.628
You need to go on lots of walks, okay?

00:38:52.668 --> 00:38:53.788
Because I'm envious.

00:38:54.188 --> 00:38:54.348
Okay.

00:38:56.449 --> 00:38:57.829
I treasure it!

00:38:57.929 --> 00:39:00.470
BAU BAU!

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:06.731
For our Question of the Day, today we have de-den!

00:39:07.272 --> 00:39:12.253
So, where did you two learn the word 'yobai' from?

00:39:14.133 --> 00:39:15.234
Ruffians!

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.814
Have you been wondering about this too?

00:39:20.695 --> 00:39:23.756
Where do you think that we learned about this word, huh?

00:39:24.276 --> 00:39:24.336
Huh?

00:39:28.052 --> 00:39:28.392
Huh?

00:39:32.035 --> 00:39:32.616
Hi.

00:39:34.357 --> 00:39:34.598
Huh?

00:39:36.899 --> 00:39:37.100
No.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.161
No!

00:39:38.761 --> 00:39:39.221
No!

00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:42.524
I'm a proper demon dog, okay?

00:39:43.065 --> 00:39:44.666
Don't misunderstand.

00:39:45.046 --> 00:39:45.427
Yeah.

00:39:46.347 --> 00:39:46.628
Wow.

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:48.586
FUWAMOCO!

00:39:48.907 --> 00:39:55.314
You know, probably by now that we know lots of things about Japanese culture and language.

00:39:55.334 --> 00:40:01.461
And that's because we had serious classes as a part of our Demon Guardian training.

00:40:01.521 --> 00:40:03.704
Yeah, not puppy classes, okay?

00:40:04.384 --> 00:40:07.345
Seriously, the course is pretty popular.

00:40:08.466 --> 00:40:18.010
And so you know, we landed there doing training in a very structured setting, talking about Japanese history and culture and all that.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.070
That's how.

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:24.233
You know, that's why it's my favorite Japanese word.

00:40:24.834 --> 00:40:29.417
Because it's really interesting and culturally important in history.

00:40:29.457 --> 00:40:30.477
That's why.

00:40:30.637 --> 00:40:31.038
Okay.

00:40:31.058 --> 00:40:33.099
Yo, no, no, no!

00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:35.981
Demon guide dog tweeting, not your...

00:40:36.381 --> 00:40:38.642
What?!

00:40:39.943 --> 00:40:40.263
No.

00:40:40.524 --> 00:40:41.124
Ruffians.

00:40:41.184 --> 00:40:41.604
No.

00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:42.965
User brains.

00:40:44.046 --> 00:40:44.666
They're there.

00:40:44.686 --> 00:40:46.167
I believe in you.

00:40:46.807 --> 00:40:48.268
This is a Mococo pup talk.

00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:49.089
Yeah.

00:40:50.607 --> 00:40:53.248
BAU BAU!

00:40:53.708 --> 00:40:54.188
Got it.

00:40:55.568 --> 00:40:56.108
Got it.

00:40:56.669 --> 00:40:58.309
No misunderstanding.

00:40:58.329 --> 00:40:59.429
Yeah.

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:03.650
How can you?

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.730
How?

00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:09.632
We were training to be demon guard dogs to protect your smile.

00:41:09.732 --> 00:41:11.652
Very serious, okay?

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:13.973
Very serious.

00:41:15.013 --> 00:41:16.053
We worked hard.

00:41:16.453 --> 00:41:16.913
We did.

00:41:17.774 --> 00:41:19.134
And now we're here.

00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:20.654
BAU BAU.

00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:21.975
I'm happy to be here.

00:41:22.515 --> 00:41:23.915
As long as you use your brain.

00:41:26.036 --> 00:41:26.596
Look at it!

00:41:27.216 --> 00:41:30.037
We have another stream coming up, right Moco-chan?

00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:38.660
Well, today... Not today, because today we're gonna be blasting through some serious homework today, right?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.661
So, please wish us luck.

00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:50.844
But tomorrow, tomorrow we'll be playing a very cute co-op game together called Bread and Fred!

00:41:51.044 --> 00:41:53.865
I don't know why their names are Bread and Fred.

00:41:53.885 --> 00:41:54.405
I don't know.

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:55.465
We'll find out, huh?

00:41:55.505 --> 00:42:03.247
We'll find out, but I think, you know, it's gonna be perfect for twin demigod dogs like us who have lots of training.

00:42:04.047 --> 00:42:05.828
Training to be Bread and Fred?

00:42:05.888 --> 00:42:06.008
No.

00:42:07.965 --> 00:42:10.346
We're FUWAMOCO!

00:42:10.406 --> 00:42:15.308
We hope that you'll join us, Ruffians, for lots of silliness, okay?

00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:17.888
BAU BAU!

00:42:18.008 --> 00:42:19.509
It's our schedule!

00:42:19.969 --> 00:42:29.532
Well, you might see that before the next FUWAMOCO Morning, we'll have our first co-op ever with AZKi-san!

00:42:29.552 --> 00:42:34.834
And well, we're gonna be playing Geoguessr together with her on her channel!

00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:37.355
So we hope that maybe you'll set your alarm clock

00:42:37.535 --> 00:42:38.956
A few hours earlier!

00:42:39.096 --> 00:42:39.957
It's a bit early.

00:42:40.117 --> 00:42:42.279
Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to join us for that.

00:42:42.379 --> 00:42:43.040
Okay!

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:43.540
Okay!

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.002
We're really looking forward to it!

00:42:46.042 --> 00:42:46.883

00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:48.784

00:42:48.824 --> 00:42:51.266
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:42:51.286 --> 00:42:52.147
Thank you!

00:42:52.267 --> 00:42:55.550
And with that, today's FUWAMOCO Morning comes to an end.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.253
Thank you so much for joining us today for our info session!

00:43:00.974 --> 00:43:03.916
Hopefully I didn't yell your ear off high.

00:43:05.658 --> 00:43:06.879
I need you to keep your ear

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:16.974
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
