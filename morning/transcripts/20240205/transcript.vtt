Extra lucky episode today!

07:25.950 --> 07:28.431
BAU BAU!

07:28.892 --> 07:34.876
Well... It may be extra lucky.

07:35.236 --> 07:38.178
Extra lucky?

07:38.658 --> 07:45.103
But... There's still been... Another Pero Sighting.

07:47.269 --> 07:49.410
Where was Pero sighted this time?

07:49.430 --> 07:51.371
Wow!

07:52.911 --> 07:53.872
De-den!

07:55.692 --> 07:58.113
Where is this?

07:59.514 --> 08:02.615
Pero was seen with a bunch of other plushies.

08:03.315 --> 08:04.335
Other plushies?

08:04.716 --> 08:08.557
I mean, he does look like he fits in with them all.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.658
But don't be fooled, Ruffians!

08:10.678 --> 08:12.078
You know, he's not Calli.

08:12.418 --> 08:13.539
He's not for sale.

08:14.770 --> 08:19.512
I know you definitely do not want to welcome him into your home, okay?

08:19.692 --> 08:20.253
No.

08:20.453 --> 08:20.713
No.

08:21.093 --> 08:24.335
Yeah, absolutely not your bed either.

08:24.355 --> 08:29.017
Also, you say he's been trying to grant you a wish?

08:30.358 --> 08:32.439
Yeah.

08:33.599 --> 08:40.143
We have been hearing reports of that, you know, ever since my birthday.

08:40.263 --> 08:42.424
I wonder what kind of connection there could be.

08:44.745 --> 08:48.729
Oh, but, well, uh... One thing, Ruffians!

08:49.349 --> 08:53.533
One thing for sure is that he can't do anything like that.

08:53.553 --> 08:56.816
Okay, after all, you know Pero.

08:57.196 --> 08:59.238
Pero's just an old demon dog.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.341
Yeah, he's not great or anything.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.623
No, he's just nasty.

09:05.943 --> 09:12.890
So no matter what he says, no matter what look he gives you, don't believe him, okay?

09:13.431 --> 09:18.897
And definitely, definitely don't look into his little eyes there, okay?

09:19.077 --> 09:19.757
No, okay.

09:20.198 --> 09:22.260
You have to be careful, okay, Ruffians?

09:23.141 --> 09:24.082
Don't trust him.

09:24.102 --> 09:25.443
He's nasty.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.561
BAU BAU!

09:29.202 --> 09:29.722
Got it.

09:30.222 --> 09:31.403
Yeah.

09:31.683 --> 09:35.026
He's just a little guy, that's what you think, huh?

09:35.066 --> 09:39.629
That's what he wants you to think, but... You have to listen to us.

09:41.330 --> 09:41.891
Got it!

09:44.593 --> 09:47.435
BAU BAU.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.856
Wow, Ruffians.

09:51.337 --> 09:52.098
That's been some...

09:53.137 --> 09:53.797
Wow, Moco-chan.

09:53.817 --> 09:55.158
It was your birthday, right?

10:18.863 --> 10:22.368
You know, I sung a bunch of songs all on my own.

10:22.388 --> 10:26.393
So I was really nervous.

10:27.134 --> 10:31.600
And you know, I did my super chow reading all on my own for the first time ever too!

10:33.134 --> 10:34.154
I was really nervous.

10:34.554 --> 10:38.976
Thank you for being there for me!

10:39.616 --> 10:40.697
Also!

10:40.717 --> 10:46.899
I announced my first ever birthday merch!

10:46.919 --> 10:48.759
BAU BAU!

10:49.359 --> 10:54.261
I feel like I can't stress enough how excited I am for my birthday merch!

10:55.021 --> 10:56.222
Both of ours, of course.

10:57.242 --> 11:00.505
Of course, I'm also really excited about my own!

11:00.945 --> 11:04.248
You know, I have a bunch of stuff here, you know?

11:04.788 --> 11:08.611
Like my own special acrylic diorama stand!

11:09.352 --> 11:10.413
But!

11:11.674 --> 11:17.999
Not only is it super cute, but the illustration is done by Aoki Ume-sensei!

11:18.119 --> 11:23.724
You know, the artist for Hidamari Sketch and I'm the character designer for Madoka Magica!

11:25.965 --> 11:26.546
So please,

11:27.432 --> 11:28.392
It's just amazing.

11:30.253 --> 11:32.474
I'm so, so, so, so honored!

11:32.655 --> 11:32.935
Right?

11:33.015 --> 11:36.796
I mean, because it's a diorama, it's kind of like a figure, right?

11:36.816 --> 11:38.137
Yeah, yeah!

11:38.817 --> 11:39.578
Very cute.

11:39.618 --> 11:43.580
You know, and I also have my Ruffian, the pink Ruffian.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.400
Bless your heart.

11:44.420 --> 11:45.841
I want to touch the toes.

11:45.861 --> 11:50.343
So now we have the set, the blue and pink Ruffians.

11:50.363 --> 11:54.365
I think, you know, the glasses are pretty cool, but

11:55.347 --> 11:56.308
I like the tail!

11:56.428 --> 11:56.968
Yeah!

11:57.148 --> 11:58.710
Aw, the toe beads!

11:58.750 --> 11:59.991
The tail, huh?

12:00.371 --> 12:00.831
Yeah.

12:00.891 --> 12:01.852
Touch the toes.

12:01.992 --> 12:02.332
Yeah!

12:02.432 --> 12:04.554
And you know they're both pretty big.

12:04.734 --> 12:04.974
Huh?

12:06.315 --> 12:09.938
I don't know about you, but I think big plushies are pretty nice, huh?

12:09.978 --> 12:11.319
You could hug them!

12:11.359 --> 12:11.800
Yeah!

12:11.840 --> 12:13.181
Perfect for hugging!

12:14.041 --> 12:16.523
And you know my t-shirt.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.805
Very cute, but cool.

12:19.145 --> 12:22.628
Says Mococo Abyssgard on the back there.

12:23.128 --> 12:23.348
Yeah.

12:24.649 --> 12:26.850
And then my special keychain.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.371
Very very cute.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.173
You know, my tail.

12:32.213 --> 12:35.275
It's a rubber strap, but it's not actually my tail.

12:35.836 --> 12:38.057
And my voice pack!

12:38.137 --> 12:40.078
Cooking donuts together!

12:42.846 --> 12:48.508
You know, if you get the complete set, you get a special appreciation voice as well!

12:48.528 --> 12:50.408
So, please check it out.

12:50.968 --> 12:53.689
I'd really like to be able to thank you properly with this.

12:54.889 --> 13:05.612
You know, I know we talked about it before, but releasing amazing merch like this, you know, it's not a given to us at all, so we put a lot of thought and love into it.

13:05.752 --> 13:09.893
We really hope you're just as excited about us to get your paws on it

13:10.453 --> 13:13.477
You know both Fuwawa and my set!

13:13.497 --> 13:16.060
BAU BAU!

13:16.120 --> 13:21.306
Remember Ruffians, our birthday merch is only available for a limited time.

13:21.326 --> 13:22.547
LIMITED TIME!

13:22.607 --> 13:24.009
Until the beginning of March.

13:24.249 --> 13:25.931
March is your deadline.

13:26.151 --> 13:29.615
So please make sure not to miss out on them, okay?

13:30.916 --> 13:36.958
Thank you so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much Ruffians!

13:37.278 --> 13:37.598
BAU BAU!

13:37.618 --> 13:39.259
I got one for each sister!

13:39.959 --> 13:40.839
BAU BAU!

13:40.879 --> 13:42.960
Thank you!

13:43.060 --> 13:44.660
Don't be sad, okay?

13:44.680 --> 13:45.921
BAU BAU!

13:50.789 --> 13:52.189
Such a good birthday.

13:52.329 --> 13:53.970
Thank you, Ruffians!

13:54.270 --> 13:54.790
Wow!

13:55.190 --> 13:59.291
We also received ice cream from a Ruffian!

13:59.451 --> 14:03.372
Thank you, too, for the impeccable reporting!

14:03.392 --> 14:05.592
BAU BAU!

14:06.032 --> 14:06.472
Wow!

14:07.073 --> 14:09.793
Something really, really cool happened, you know.

14:10.133 --> 14:11.413
For some of our senpai.

14:11.493 --> 14:12.514
One of our senpai, yeah.

14:12.534 --> 14:15.174
And you might have missed the Ruffians, okay?

14:15.354 --> 14:15.694
Did you?

14:15.714 --> 14:17.075
Did you hear about this?

14:17.695 --> 14:18.135
Wow.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.736
Kanata-senpai!

14:21.176 --> 14:29.618
She just released a brand new song written by the super famous music producer, Tsunku-san!

14:29.658 --> 14:32.359
The song is called Junsui-shin.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.540
Did you catch it, Ruffians?

14:34.940 --> 14:35.480
You missed it?

14:35.660 --> 14:36.220
Oh wow!

14:36.240 --> 14:38.401
You took the scoop, you know.

14:39.741 --> 14:45.623
Well, if you haven't heard of Tsunku-san before, he's famous for being the music producer of the

14:45.783 --> 14:50.985
The legendary idol group Morning Musume and also the idol agency Hello!

14:51.045 --> 14:52.126
Project too!

14:52.846 --> 14:55.467
He's a producer that we really like and admire too.

14:55.848 --> 15:01.870
So we're super surprised and happy for Kanata-senpai because we know that she really loves idols from Hello!

15:01.910 --> 15:03.231
Project as well.

15:03.331 --> 15:07.953
I saw on Twitter, I was like, oh my gosh, what did I just see?

15:08.093 --> 15:08.393
Right!

15:10.074 --> 15:17.396
But you know, this song is really, really cool, and it has a super strong Hello Project sound to it.

15:17.756 --> 15:24.378
But also, surprisingly, some pretty awesome mecha fights in the ending too.

15:24.638 --> 15:26.479
You need to check it out, okay, Ruffians?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.400
If you missed it, especially, okay?

15:30.640 --> 15:35.081
We also want to say a big congrats to Kanata-san!

15:35.121 --> 15:37.242
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

15:37.682 --> 15:44.404
She must be so happy to have a song written for her by a producer like Tsunku-san and Chiyomaru-san.

15:44.424 --> 15:45.185
Right!

15:45.205 --> 15:46.765
That's the dream, huh?

15:46.805 --> 15:47.465
BAU BAU!

16:00.480 --> 16:01.521
Ruffians!

16:02.002 --> 16:06.168
I think you noticed this one, but recently a lot of our senpai

16:13.612 --> 16:25.479
Recently, when Fubuki-senpai and Suisei-senpai were playing PAO World, they managed to catch two very, very rare and legendary PAOs.

16:25.759 --> 16:29.442
You know, just like that, they look like big knights with fluffy tails.

16:30.816 --> 16:31.798
I'm naming them!

16:31.838 --> 16:32.379
They decided...

16:41.058 --> 16:45.039
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

16:45.079 --> 16:45.879
BAU BAU!

16:46.060 --> 16:50.541
It's time for <i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

17:02.485 --> 17:04.907
FUWAMOCO night's hot!

17:05.487 --> 17:06.307
I know us!

17:06.708 --> 17:09.510
We'll do our best to protect you smiles!

17:09.650 --> 17:13.292
And I guess, got their other pals in PAL world too now, right?

17:13.432 --> 17:16.634
And he's so sweet!

17:16.794 --> 17:18.696
Only Fuwawa's horny!

17:19.676 --> 17:23.579
Well, I think Moco-chan, you make a good Dark Knight, right?

17:24.479 --> 17:27.942
Yeah, do I. Yeah, do I!

17:28.162 --> 17:29.683
Dark Knight Fuwawa though.

17:31.348 --> 17:32.068
Holy Night.

17:32.449 --> 17:33.289
Mococo.

17:33.369 --> 17:34.670
That could work too.

17:35.490 --> 17:36.571
I don't know the difference.

17:37.411 --> 17:38.692
BAU BAU!

17:38.792 --> 17:42.614
BAU was so much fun though.

17:42.734 --> 17:45.956
I got there up to a lot of fun and silliness.

17:47.677 --> 17:49.117
BAU BAU!

17:49.698 --> 17:56.541
Well, Ruffians, as you know, there's been so many special occasions going on recently, huh?

17:56.661 --> 17:57.082
Yeah.

17:58.044 --> 18:05.950
Well, I think we're all kind of aware of it by now, but Valentine's Day is just right around the corner.

18:06.270 --> 18:07.251
Right!

18:08.652 --> 18:17.017
And well to celebrate it, there's been some brand new hololive English merch that's just been released!

18:17.077 --> 18:19.019
BAU BAU!

18:19.339 --> 18:20.340
The lighted inquisim.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.962
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

18:44.657 --> 18:48.078
I think Ruffians are good!

18:48.498 --> 18:52.959
It's pretty cute.

18:54.259 --> 19:00.441
Ruffians, if you want to get a bit more into the Valentine's Day spirit, please check them out!

19:00.541 --> 19:00.981
Okay?

19:01.001 --> 19:04.342
You can find them on the hololive official store.

19:04.442 --> 19:05.602
BAU BAU!

19:10.144 --> 19:11.985
Valentine's Day, huh?

19:12.105 --> 19:14.426
Yeah, but today's not Valentine's Day.

19:14.526 --> 19:14.986
No!

19:15.126 --> 19:19.068
Actually, today... It's Twin Day!

19:19.088 --> 19:20.609
Yeah!

19:20.949 --> 19:27.272
And, well, you know... We had some dreams, but... Why is it Twin Day, Moco-chan?

19:27.292 --> 19:30.173
Oh, well... February 5th is Twin Day in Japan, you know?

19:30.333 --> 19:30.473
Yeah.

19:30.734 --> 19:34.235
I know it's not 5th anymore in Japan, but... Yeah, 2-5-5.

19:35.936 --> 19:38.301
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

19:45.692 --> 20:00.563
Our special day is for a week long, and you know, twin day is also kind of our special day too, so... There's a lot of fun celebration going on, but you know, also today is episode 77!

20:00.663 --> 20:03.064
Double twin digits on twin day!

20:03.084 --> 20:05.126
Extra special, right?

20:05.666 --> 20:09.949
Later days always work out like this, huh?

20:10.109 --> 20:14.192
But, we actually both had dreams last night.

20:14.572 --> 20:15.013
Yeah.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.586
We dreamt of each other!

20:21.449 --> 20:27.960
Dreaming of double dreams and dreaming of each other on twin days is kinda weird, Ruffians, but...

20:28.763 --> 20:30.383
Okay!

20:30.904 --> 20:31.664
Yes, yes!

20:33.044 --> 20:33.564
Well!

20:34.344 --> 20:36.385
First up is my dream!

20:36.865 --> 20:39.145
Mococo's dream!

20:39.726 --> 20:46.267
So, recently, you know, we splurged a bit and we bought some sparkling water.

20:46.547 --> 20:47.908
Because we really like it.

20:48.028 --> 20:49.588
The one that we really like.

20:49.688 --> 20:50.948
And it was on sale!

20:51.268 --> 20:54.469
And you know, I've been saving mine in the fridge.

20:56.169 --> 20:57.890
But, in my dream,

20:59.679 --> 21:04.960
I dreamt that I went to go drink wine, and it was the last one in the fridge.

21:05.760 --> 21:12.262
But, when I went to open it, I noticed that it was already half-dranken.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.723
And then Fuwawa was like, oh sorry, I made a mistake.

21:16.223 --> 21:22.304
And you know, drank some of the wine that you had there and then forgot about it and then drank a different bottle.

21:22.464 --> 21:23.804
Sorry Moco-chan!

21:24.865 --> 21:26.085
And that was really sad.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.205
Why it's funny though?

21:28.225 --> 21:35.108
Because I'm excited about the drink, but I don't think that I like it that much that I would dream about it, you know?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.128
You know?

21:36.788 --> 21:43.491
And rather than being sad in my dream that it was half-drinken, I was more sad that the fizziness was gone.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.532
Things are silly, huh?

21:48.148 --> 21:49.669
Drinking water.

21:50.049 --> 21:51.749
Important dream, huh?

21:51.849 --> 21:54.410
Fuwawa, how crazy you are!

21:54.531 --> 21:55.971
I sound like a dark knight.

21:56.351 --> 22:02.574
A dark knight who'll open up your fizzy water, take a drink, and then put it back and let it unfizz.

22:04.314 --> 22:04.695
Darkness.

22:06.635 --> 22:10.417
Well, for my dream, for Fuwawa's dream... Well...

22:14.580 --> 22:16.161
It wasn't good.

22:20.405 --> 22:24.228
Well, I jumped at, you know, we're doing a Rock n' Rawr Party.

22:24.248 --> 22:32.735
Usually there's a lot of prep to do, so we just finished right in time before we need to press start.

22:33.135 --> 22:39.321
But this time we kind of ran out of time and we were finally ready.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.923
1 minute and 48 seconds after we had to press start.

22:45.384 --> 22:49.167
Yeah, I was upset, but, you know, I couldn't really be helped.

22:49.567 --> 22:55.011
But for some reason though, Moco-chan was like, no, I need to get other things done too.

22:55.031 --> 23:00.115
I was starting to work on like prepping thumbnail stuff and like other things that wasn't really necessary.

23:00.135 --> 23:03.818
And she just wouldn't start the stream.

23:04.039 --> 23:04.299
Huh?

23:05.976 --> 23:12.681
And finally, 7 minutes have passed, and I was able to convince her to do those things after.

23:12.701 --> 23:14.082
7 minutes, you know?

23:14.102 --> 23:18.945
And so then we started the stream, but I felt so bad, Ruffians.

23:19.525 --> 23:24.089
You know, we kept you all waiting without any explanation too!

23:24.109 --> 23:25.950
7 minutes, right!

23:28.621 --> 23:29.442
Moco-chan.

23:43.288 --> 23:47.711
And finally, 15 minutes to 8 AM.

23:47.731 --> 23:53.194
Moco-chan finally decided to get moving, but we really had nothing prepped yet.

23:53.634 --> 23:58.618
And I was just so upset at Moco-chan, and Moco-chan was so grumpy at me too.

23:58.718 --> 23:59.678
I'm not grumpy.

23:59.698 --> 24:03.601
You know we were barking at each other.

24:03.621 --> 24:05.122
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

24:05.382 --> 24:05.762
Uh-oh.

24:06.491 --> 24:09.552
And it was just everything was the worst!

24:10.172 --> 24:24.636
And then you know we're supposed to start and try and get, you know, all the Ruffians, we're supposed to start your day on the right paw and we were very much on the wrong paw and didn't have anything ready.

24:25.456 --> 24:27.937
It was super rough, but

24:30.346 --> 24:34.690
It was okay, actually, because Moco-chan woke me up very early.

24:34.710 --> 24:42.116
This morning was like, Fuwawa, I woke up a bit early, but let's get going and have a good today.

24:42.136 --> 24:43.156
A good day today.

24:43.176 --> 24:45.138
A good today.

24:45.758 --> 24:47.880
Okay, you know, just like that.

24:47.900 --> 24:52.264
You know, let's get ready for FUWAMOCO Morning!

24:53.384 --> 25:00.647
You know, I think us fighting like that in my dreams is more disturbing because that sort of thing never happens.

25:02.548 --> 25:06.209
Dreams are funny, huh?

25:06.509 --> 25:07.289
Yeah.

25:07.510 --> 25:10.951
It was okay in the end.

25:11.011 --> 25:14.172
Because it was just a dream, but... It's just a dream.

25:14.632 --> 25:16.893
It's funny how things are like that, right?

25:16.913 --> 25:18.194
Yeah.

25:21.168 --> 25:22.510
Dreams are dreams.

25:22.530 --> 25:24.753
They can be silly, huh?

25:24.773 --> 25:27.396
Yeah, those were our twin dreams.

25:27.937 --> 25:28.617
Our twin day!

25:30.059 --> 25:34.124
BAU BAU!

25:34.164 --> 25:35.385
Ruffians!

25:35.926 --> 25:39.350
I'm excited because, you know, it's February.

25:40.011 --> 25:43.494
The first proper week, the first Monday in February.

25:43.514 --> 25:50.980
And with every Monday, you know, it's a good time to challenge yourself because it's the beginning to a new week.

25:51.441 --> 25:58.587
Which means today, Moco-chan's gonna challenge herself to eating some natto!

25:58.667 --> 26:00.589
BAU BAU!

26:01.903 --> 26:07.506
Just like every week, you know, for a long time now, Moco-chan, you've been trying something new.

26:07.946 --> 26:14.089
Trying to overcome and conquer natto, which is a common breakfast food in Japan.

26:14.689 --> 26:19.931
It consists of some fermented soybeans that's really, really, really healthy for you.

26:20.572 --> 26:23.093
But it's a little bit of an acquired taste.

26:23.573 --> 26:25.134
It's a little bit sticky.

26:25.974 --> 26:27.135
And slimy.

26:28.055 --> 26:29.956
And a bit stinky.

26:32.614 --> 26:34.175
But, it's healthy for you.

26:34.195 --> 26:38.916
FUWAMOCO eats everyday and Moco-chan wants to be a little bit more like her.

26:39.476 --> 26:44.958
All this is to be able to pet your smile for many many years, just like me.

26:45.038 --> 26:48.038
I just don't feel like eating today.

26:50.759 --> 26:56.202
Well, there's a lot of Ruffians that want to challenge new things, but they're like, aw, baby, not today.

26:56.222 --> 26:56.322
Right?

26:57.303 --> 26:59.344
Just like Moco-chan, you're feeling not today.

26:59.364 --> 27:00.965
I don't feel like it today.

27:00.985 --> 27:01.705
Yeah.

27:02.126 --> 27:05.047
But you're going to do it whether you feel like it or not.

27:05.427 --> 27:08.469
Because sometimes that's half the battle, right?

27:09.069 --> 27:09.850
Right, Ruffians?

27:10.430 --> 27:15.594
Boy, my birthday rice today hot!

27:16.075 --> 27:22.840
I'm gonna stir it up lots and lots because Moco-chan, I want you to eat lots and lots today.

27:23.361 --> 27:25.182
I think it's in a really good condition.

27:25.202 --> 27:26.303
It doesn't look that.

27:26.323 --> 27:33.469
I woke up so nicely and then she goes, Moco-chan, I want you to eat lot and lot today.

27:33.829 --> 27:38.633
Moco-chan, I'm gonna put some sesame oil in it too so you can eat lots right off the bat.

27:39.778 --> 27:41.279
I really don't think I can.

27:41.559 --> 27:47.843
Oh gosh, don't spill it everywhere!

27:49.624 --> 27:50.945
Things are happening.

27:50.965 --> 27:56.709
She's getting it everywhere!

27:56.749 --> 27:58.150
I'm getting it everywhere.

28:00.391 --> 28:02.953
With the sesame oil, oh it smells so good.

28:06.328 --> 28:08.430
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

28:08.450 --> 28:08.730
BAU BAU!

28:36.028 --> 28:37.449
It smells good, too.

28:37.469 --> 28:39.630
Okay, Moco-chan, here you go!

28:39.650 --> 28:46.714
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard to make this, okay?

28:47.254 --> 28:47.634
Why?

28:47.654 --> 28:49.195
It smells like sesame oil.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.756
It's easy mode right now.

28:51.776 --> 28:56.579
No, I just thought, just... Ruffians, it looks really different today.

28:56.599 --> 28:57.499
It's not at all.

28:57.519 --> 28:59.941
No, it really does.

29:02.522 --> 29:03.523
You can do it, Moco-chan.

29:06.900 --> 29:11.263
It looks really different to me.

29:11.843 --> 29:13.565
It looks really soupy.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.186
And sticky.

29:17.327 --> 29:18.608
You can do it, Moco-chan!

29:18.648 --> 29:20.269
No complaining, okay?

29:20.289 --> 29:22.771
I can see the oil boiling.

29:23.091 --> 29:26.133
The oil is all piling up at the bottom of the pan!

29:26.153 --> 29:27.214
Just add a bit more, Mococo.

29:27.294 --> 29:27.594
No!

29:32.108 --> 29:32.928
I got this, Mococo!

29:33.048 --> 29:37.249
The oil is making it even more sticky and good.

29:37.970 --> 29:38.650
It'll be good.

29:39.530 --> 29:41.070
Pick up a couple beans, okay?

29:41.090 --> 29:43.711
You've been eating one bean average.

29:44.251 --> 29:45.431
Without the sesame oil.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.052
That's already amazing!

29:48.652 --> 29:50.013
Moco-chan, at least two, okay?

29:50.053 --> 29:51.773
They have sesame oil in it.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.414
I made a baby bowl for you.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.994
One bean after another.

29:57.014 --> 29:57.915
Yeah.

29:57.935 --> 29:58.675
Yeah.

29:59.639 --> 30:01.280
Beans and concession, okay?

30:01.300 --> 30:01.420
Yeah.

30:01.980 --> 30:05.082
Okay, I'm gonna try!

30:05.102 --> 30:06.583
Go for it, Moco-chan!

30:06.663 --> 30:07.643
I believe in you!

30:07.663 --> 30:07.743
Okay.

30:08.904 --> 30:11.305
I'm not stalling!

30:11.325 --> 30:12.526
I'm gonna try!

30:12.566 --> 30:15.407
One for twin day, two for twin day.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.888
Yup, yup, yup.

30:17.948 --> 30:18.709
I'm gonna try, okay.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.369
Okay, Moco-chan!

30:20.770 --> 30:21.390
Three!

30:21.410 --> 30:21.950
Two!

30:22.290 --> 30:22.491
One!

30:22.731 --> 30:23.211
No, no.

30:24.331 --> 30:25.632
Do it, Moco-chan.

30:26.793 --> 30:28.574
The plane went in and then went out.

30:29.074 --> 30:29.174
No.

30:29.997 --> 30:30.738
Moco-chan!

30:30.758 --> 30:32.219
Three!

30:32.379 --> 30:33.119
Two!

30:33.240 --> 30:33.880
I dropped it.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.201
You didn't drop it.

30:35.221 --> 30:35.982
I picked it back up.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.043
I did drop it.

30:38.844 --> 30:39.444
Three!

30:39.764 --> 30:40.745
Two!

30:40.865 --> 30:41.085
One!

30:42.827 --> 30:43.768
Okay, okay.

30:43.848 --> 30:44.368
It landed.

30:44.388 --> 30:45.889
The plane landed.

30:45.909 --> 30:47.370
She's chewing it.

30:47.390 --> 30:48.111
That's cool.

30:48.491 --> 30:49.312
Good job, Moco-chan.

30:49.332 --> 30:50.373
You're chewing it.

30:51.536 --> 30:52.797
Nice one!

30:53.057 --> 30:53.418
Okay!

30:53.438 --> 30:54.359
I stomped it down.

30:54.899 --> 30:56.480
Good job, Moco-chan!

30:56.901 --> 30:59.403
The second bead is in the chopsticks!

31:00.164 --> 31:01.705
I made sure the good chopsticks are good.

31:01.965 --> 31:06.369
Why is it, why is it, why is it...

31:09.426 --> 31:10.327
Awesome!

31:10.747 --> 31:11.467
Okay.

31:11.768 --> 31:12.668
You're doing it.

31:12.908 --> 31:15.170
You're doing it.

31:15.190 --> 31:15.790
You can do it!

31:15.810 --> 31:16.851
You can do it, Moco-chan!

31:16.871 --> 31:17.491
Don't give up!

31:17.911 --> 31:18.532
You can do it!

31:18.852 --> 31:19.973
You're strong, Popo!

31:20.613 --> 31:20.913
Yeah!

31:21.474 --> 31:21.854
Yeah!

31:22.854 --> 31:22.975
Okay!

31:23.015 --> 31:23.335
Yeah!

31:28.408 --> 31:30.209
Oh no, Moco-chan!

31:30.509 --> 31:31.269
I did it!

31:31.369 --> 31:32.110
Are you crying?

31:32.130 --> 31:34.171
It was very difficult, but I did it!

31:34.271 --> 31:37.012
I'm so proud of you, Moco-chan!

31:37.132 --> 31:39.153
I don't have tears now!

31:39.173 --> 31:41.854
A twin did too, B!

31:41.874 --> 31:42.994
Give me the water!

31:43.014 --> 31:43.754
Please.

31:44.195 --> 31:44.715
Please!

31:45.575 --> 31:47.156
Give me the water, please!

31:48.276 --> 31:48.957
BAU BAU!

31:48.997 --> 31:49.297
BAU BAU!

31:54.939 --> 31:59.020
That was rough, wasn't it?

31:59.220 --> 32:01.640
You look troublesome today.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.741
I'm not crying, okay?

32:06.801 --> 32:08.942
You did a good job, Moco-chan!

32:09.102 --> 32:10.622
BAU BAU!

32:11.182 --> 32:13.103
BAU BAU!

32:13.123 --> 32:16.863
No fizzy water.

32:16.963 --> 32:18.104
No fizzy water.

32:21.923 --> 32:22.863
Is he not the water?

32:23.003 --> 32:24.484
I don't know about that.

32:25.624 --> 32:27.504
Good job, Moco-chan!

32:28.765 --> 32:35.187
Well, Ruffians, you know that was Moco-chan's best attempt at eating natto for this week.

32:35.347 --> 32:40.828
Please remember, you know, no matter how much you might not want to do it, today's the day, okay?

32:41.288 --> 32:47.070
Let Moco-chan's hard work guide you to working hard at whatever you need to challenge, okay?

32:48.910 --> 32:51.053
Mococo amazing.

32:52.154 --> 32:53.915
Proud of her as always.

32:53.935 --> 32:56.037
BAU BAU!

32:57.539 --> 33:02.043
I'm looking forward to the leftovers too.

33:02.544 --> 33:07.048
Let's see who is the Doggie of the Day today.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.871
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

33:11.552 --> 33:19.799
Ponzu really loves the hot carpet.

33:19.819 --> 33:20.520
The hot carpet.

33:29.209 --> 33:32.011
It's a hot climate.

33:32.051 --> 33:36.094
You know it's perfect on a cold winter morning, right?

33:36.634 --> 33:37.455
Chihuahua kana?

33:37.475 --> 33:38.476
Chihuahua kana?

33:38.496 --> 33:40.297
Fuwawa chihuahua janai yo.

33:40.657 --> 33:41.758
It's not chihuahua.

33:41.858 --> 33:43.999
It's, you know, hot ponzu.

33:44.019 --> 33:44.600
Toasty ponzu.

33:44.640 --> 33:49.203
Well ponzu's charm point is a little white toes too.

33:53.886 --> 33:54.726
Yeah.

33:54.746 --> 33:56.127
Doggy song!

33:56.527 --> 33:56.947
Right!

33:57.027 --> 33:59.108
Ponzu has doggy songs!

33:59.969 --> 34:01.749
BAU BAU!

34:02.069 --> 34:04.751
Wow, Moco-chan, how do you think ponzu BAU BAU?

34:05.691 --> 34:09.152
Maybe a bit... Sweet.

34:09.653 --> 34:11.113
But a bit sour.

34:11.253 --> 34:12.234
Ah, citrusy.

34:12.494 --> 34:14.535
BAU BAU BAU!

34:14.595 --> 34:16.275

BAU BAU BAU!

34:25.850 --> 34:26.390
Zesty, yeah.

34:26.570 --> 34:29.512
Zesty BAU BAU.

34:30.033 --> 34:34.336
Well, Ponzu, you know, Ponzu's an obvious cutie.

34:34.916 --> 34:39.700
Very much looks like a citrusy little Ponzu-chan!

34:39.900 --> 34:45.244
And, you know, Ponzu loves cuddling and getting warm hugs from you, I'm sure.

34:45.604 --> 34:48.606
And I think, you know, those eyes.

34:49.086 --> 34:51.108
I can see those eyes say, I like

34:51.368 --> 34:52.389
BAU BAU!

35:07.051 --> 35:08.512
Today I went on a walk.

35:08.612 --> 35:10.253
Where did we go?

35:10.273 --> 35:11.034
Where did we go?

35:11.294 --> 35:12.675
De-den!

35:14.636 --> 35:18.179
Such a cool tropical walk.

35:18.399 --> 35:25.283
And coming across a magical little stream of magical nature too.

35:25.403 --> 35:28.605
I bet all the nature sounds are so relaxing.

35:29.026 --> 35:30.046
I like to hear it, huh?

35:30.127 --> 35:31.808
It's like BAU BAU!

35:31.848 --> 35:32.648
BAU BAU!

35:32.668 --> 35:34.569
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

35:37.031 --> 35:39.933

35:39.973 --> 35:43.495
We had a nice time there, you know.

35:43.515 --> 35:45.997
Reconnecting with the world and nature.

35:46.097 --> 35:47.958
BAU BAU!

35:48.338 --> 35:54.783
And today, we received a question!

35:54.963 --> 35:57.664
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

36:01.807 --> 36:01.927
Oh!

36:02.628 --> 36:02.748
Oh!

36:03.868 --> 36:04.609
It went so fast!

36:04.649 --> 36:09.091
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

36:09.731 --> 36:13.353
Question from a Ruffian who loves you both.

36:13.513 --> 36:25.339
I never wanted to pick favorites, but with things like the blue pink version Ruffians and separated birthdays, I've been wondering, do you actually like it when we pick one?

36:25.660 --> 36:28.021
Maybe it'll let each of you feel special.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.081
BAU BAU.

36:30.999 --> 36:33.462
This is a tricky question, but a good one!

36:34.102 --> 36:35.383
Yeah, it's hard, right?

36:39.113 --> 36:42.875
We want your love us both more than anything, you know?

36:43.415 --> 36:51.699
Yeah, so we'd rather not have you pick between us, but if you do... We understand, you know.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.040
I guess it's natural heart.

36:54.100 --> 36:59.062
Yeah, but maybe keep it a bit of a secret from us, too.

37:00.383 --> 37:03.484
But you know, I love Moco-chan!

37:03.524 --> 37:04.385
Yeah, and...

37:05.569 --> 37:06.950
I'm a Fuwawa too.

37:07.210 --> 37:08.771
It is twin day, I'll say it.

37:08.831 --> 37:09.311
Thank you.

37:10.912 --> 37:17.035
But, well, you know, it's also nice to have our own very special days too.

37:17.395 --> 37:21.317
You know, to be recognized as individuals too.

37:21.617 --> 37:24.798
We're not only FUWAMOCO, you know, also FUWAWA.

37:25.178 --> 37:25.619
And Mococo-e.

37:26.679 --> 37:30.201
But together we are FUWAMOCO!

37:31.281 --> 37:39.805
So like we kind of said before, if FUWAMOCO is your oshi, then actually you have three oshi!

37:39.825 --> 37:47.008
Fuwawa, Mococo, and FUWAMOCO!

37:48.329 --> 37:50.730
But you know, we also know it's natural.

37:51.130 --> 37:51.590
Hello!

37:56.649 --> 38:03.896
Thank you so much for all your submissions today, Ruffians!

38:04.657 --> 38:07.599
Please, we're always looking

38:21.011 --> 38:24.054

We're going to be over on Reine-senpai's channel for the first time.

38:51.153 --> 38:53.573
It's just going to be us three!

38:53.633 --> 38:59.174
We're super excited because Reine-senpai is going to be teaching us Indonesian.

38:59.895 --> 39:01.255
Actually, no Ruffians.

39:01.275 --> 39:05.396
We went a little bit before and it was a lot of fun.

39:06.776 --> 39:09.860
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

39:22.053 --> 39:25.216

39:29.099 --> 39:32.682
Alright, let me take a peek at this week's schedule.

39:33.383 --> 39:37.326
On Tuesday, we're gonna be playing some more Metal Gear Solid 2.

39:38.407 --> 39:40.889
Now Moco-chan, you've been doing better and better.

39:41.270 --> 39:43.972
Your sneaking and your shooting skills, right.

39:45.031 --> 39:45.271
Yes.

39:45.951 --> 39:52.595
But, uh, well, we weren't really able to save the president like we first set out to do.

39:53.015 --> 39:53.555
Oh well.

39:54.175 --> 39:54.776
Too bad.

39:54.816 --> 39:55.696
Oh well.

39:56.136 --> 40:03.039
Yeah, you know there's other important objectives in our mission now too, so we're gonna do our best!

40:10.185 --> 40:11.947
Don't be confused, Ruffians!

40:12.567 --> 40:14.929
Another FUWAMOCO Morning isn't starting today!

40:14.949 --> 40:18.353
But the day is just beginning, okay?

40:18.853 --> 40:22.917
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

40:24.118 --> 40:30.282
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
