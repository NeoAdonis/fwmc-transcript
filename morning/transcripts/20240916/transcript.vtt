05:24.714 --> 05:27.876

05:28.336 --> 05:31.139
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:58.280 --> 05:58.780
Only today.

05:59.161 --> 05:59.601
Ruffians!

05:59.681 --> 06:03.003
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:03.023 --> 06:04.524
You woke up 5 minutes ago!

06:04.804 --> 06:06.205
Good morning!

06:06.225 --> 06:07.606
You're perfectly on time!

06:07.626 --> 06:08.866

06:08.947 --> 06:10.307
Good morning!

06:11.008 --> 06:12.148
Perfectly on time!

06:12.369 --> 06:15.610
What about the Ruffians that have been up for a couple hours, Moco-chan?

06:15.651 --> 06:16.191
You're early.

06:16.931 --> 06:17.512
You know what?

06:19.477 --> 06:20.077
Early worm.

06:21.318 --> 06:22.099
Wakes up early.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.121
BAU BAU!

06:26.161 --> 06:37.448
Well, for the Ruffians that are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:37.548 --> 06:37.869
A.K.A.

06:37.969 --> 06:38.829
FUWAMOCO!

06:38.929 --> 06:42.151
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:42.211 --> 06:42.932

06:43.512 --> 06:49.616
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:50.016 --> 06:54.959
Please say your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:55.019 --> 07:00.102
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:00.542 --> 07:02.743
BAU BAU!

07:03.024 --> 07:04.044
Are you awake now?

07:04.064 --> 07:07.206
I'll awake in one day, that's what I mean!

07:07.266 --> 07:10.008
Have you been a bit sleepier than regular?

07:11.447 --> 07:13.709
Well, maybe this week won't help.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.352
It's time to wake up, Ruffians!

07:17.372 --> 07:18.192
Again!

07:18.273 --> 07:18.973
Yeah, I know.

07:18.993 --> 07:20.374
The seasons are changing.

07:20.434 --> 07:22.016
It's going from summer to fall.

07:22.156 --> 07:22.416
Yeah.

07:22.496 --> 07:24.498
But time doesn't mean you can sleep in, okay?

07:24.558 --> 07:25.799
Maybe sometime.

07:25.859 --> 07:28.181
You're tired this morning, but you're up now!

07:28.281 --> 07:29.021
Maybe sometime.

07:29.061 --> 07:31.563
Maybe we can make you feel a little less tired.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.844
Yeah.

07:33.645 --> 07:37.028
Well, how are we gonna start this week out, Moco-chan?

07:39.658 --> 07:42.479
Does something awful make you feel less tired?

07:44.199 --> 07:46.140
Maybe it depends on the Ruffian.

07:47.580 --> 07:54.142
I know that awful things make me want to just go back into bed, but... My strength is gone!

07:54.182 --> 07:55.582
Maybe it'll be shocking!

07:57.563 --> 08:00.163
Well, let's shock the Ruffians awake!

08:01.384 --> 08:01.744
Okay.

08:02.844 --> 08:04.665
There's been another Pero Sighting.

08:08.127 --> 08:10.409
What is he been saying now, Moco-chan?

08:14.252 --> 08:16.774
De-den!

08:17.875 --> 08:22.199
Oh, that's a pretty snuggly and nasty looking perro there!

08:22.239 --> 08:22.720
Nasty?

08:23.040 --> 08:27.043
Is he trying to take over your bed?

08:27.083 --> 08:27.664
Bed?

08:32.225 --> 08:35.290
I think the Ruffian, did you notice something?

08:35.830 --> 08:38.595
Imperial think he's gonna take over your bed.

08:39.196 --> 08:42.521
Think he's gonna have a bit of a tough fight in front of him, no?

08:43.810 --> 08:44.310
You know.

08:44.470 --> 08:44.750
Look!

08:45.071 --> 08:46.191
Look, Ruffians!

08:46.691 --> 08:47.672
Do you see?

08:47.792 --> 08:48.352
Yeah!

08:48.392 --> 08:53.294
This Ruffian has very fierce tiger bedsheets.

08:53.374 --> 08:54.494
Is that a bedsheet?

08:55.154 --> 08:56.075
I think so!

08:56.115 --> 08:56.915
It's so fancy!

08:56.935 --> 08:57.075
Right!

08:57.415 --> 08:58.096
Fancy?

08:58.676 --> 09:00.997
I don't know, Moco-chan.

09:01.077 --> 09:04.878
I'm a little intimidated by them too, no?

09:05.739 --> 09:06.379
Right.

09:06.799 --> 09:07.899
Fancy.

09:10.060 --> 09:10.780
I don't know.

09:10.860 --> 09:11.801
Is that a bedsheet?

09:13.965 --> 09:14.765
It's scary.

09:15.566 --> 09:17.307
Intimidating.

09:17.647 --> 09:19.928
Fierce.

09:20.409 --> 09:22.009
Pero's gonna have a hard time.

09:24.611 --> 09:26.452
Let us know how it went.

09:26.852 --> 09:29.694
I'm sure it was easy for you.

09:29.734 --> 09:30.674
Just keep them out.

09:30.894 --> 09:34.656
BAU BAU!

09:35.477 --> 09:38.298
Wow, I like the matching caps.

09:38.919 --> 09:41.160
I'll mark it right off his head.

09:42.481 --> 09:46.143
BAU BAU!

09:46.683 --> 09:48.264
Exciting big news!

09:48.645 --> 09:54.588
Just over this weekend, iHololive English Dice and Fun!

09:54.869 --> 09:59.932
All of hololive, they celebrated their 4th anniversary!

09:59.992 --> 10:02.473
BAU BAU!

10:02.894 --> 10:04.795
It's amazing, Ruffians!

10:05.816 --> 10:07.337
4 years!

10:07.357 --> 10:09.239
4 years of hololive English!

10:09.259 --> 10:13.984
4 years of hololive English all together.

10:14.024 --> 10:15.025
Oh my gosh.

10:15.725 --> 10:17.227
We're so happy!

10:17.427 --> 10:19.489
I know.

10:19.910 --> 10:25.755
They were saying that when they joined, their senpai were celebrating their 4th year.

10:26.276 --> 10:29.299
That's a long time.

10:30.060 --> 10:30.861
Yeah.

10:31.541 --> 10:34.183
Oh my gosh, but now we're here!

10:34.223 --> 10:36.865
We get to celebrate the 4th anniversary!

10:36.925 --> 10:41.888
And watch all of hololive go into their 5th year!

10:41.948 --> 10:43.809
Their 5th year in hololive!

10:43.829 --> 10:48.392
And do it so in style with our 3D anniversary live!

10:48.813 --> 10:49.033
Yeah!

10:49.593 --> 10:54.936
It was so amazing to see them all sing and dance together, you know.

10:55.276 --> 10:56.637
Reunion!

10:57.037 --> 10:59.599
Journey like a thousand years.

11:00.479 --> 11:06.183
I know, I was really happy to hear reunion again after, you know, Breaking Dimension.

11:07.023 --> 11:08.805
It got me so teary.

11:08.845 --> 11:11.028
I cried too long.

11:11.128 --> 11:21.880
But then not only did they just sing the songs all together, but then they split off to sing each other's solo songs individually and also in units too!

11:21.900 --> 11:24.202
I was really surprised!

11:26.304 --> 11:28.105
That was amazing!

11:28.145 --> 11:28.465
Yeah!

11:28.525 --> 11:31.526
The shuffle was so incredible!

11:31.626 --> 11:31.966
Right!

11:32.387 --> 11:33.827
It was really cutesy!

11:33.907 --> 11:37.709
Kiara-senpai have sing to Chikutaku, you know?

11:37.729 --> 11:37.809
Yeah!

11:38.229 --> 11:38.830
End of a life.

11:38.910 --> 11:41.151
End of a life is cute.

11:41.611 --> 11:42.892
It was amazing.

11:42.992 --> 11:44.292
Yeah.

11:44.692 --> 11:51.055
Yeah, you know, it's just, it really brought back a lot of memories and emotions to Ruffians!

11:51.316 --> 11:51.616
Right!

11:52.356 --> 11:52.936
Yup.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.717
Then you know everything kinda has to come to a close.

11:57.157 --> 12:05.599
And it will make sense that, well, near the end, they're gonna perform their brand new song, The Show Goes On!

12:05.619 --> 12:07.259
It's gonna end with a big bang!

12:07.279 --> 12:07.619
Big bang!

12:07.699 --> 12:09.040
Brand new song!

12:09.080 --> 12:14.081
Yeah, you know, and The Show Goes On, it's an amazing show too!

12:14.541 --> 12:19.722
Wow, and very fitting of the Broadway, like, stage that they were dancing on!

12:20.922 --> 12:21.603
So cool!

12:21.643 --> 12:23.364
Yeah, so jazzy!

12:23.564 --> 12:28.447
It's unlike any other hololive English song so far, so please go check it out!

12:28.507 --> 12:30.749
It's now on Stringling's services!

12:30.769 --> 12:36.672
So don't forget to add it to your playlist and listen to it lots to locate!

12:36.953 --> 12:39.014
Everyone's dresses are so cute!

12:39.134 --> 12:40.054
Right!

12:40.655 --> 12:43.997
Kelly-senpai's shirt is very blood red.

12:44.595 --> 12:46.337
Oh, I wish I could be tucked in.

12:46.997 --> 12:49.839
I don't know, Ame-senpai looks like a little doll there.

12:49.899 --> 12:50.980
Right?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.982
So cute.

12:53.082 --> 12:53.382
Yeah.

12:53.422 --> 12:56.705
I wanna see Ina-senpai spin and spin and spin and spin.

12:57.706 --> 12:58.506
Yeah.

12:59.347 --> 13:01.469
But now that I ask, she probably won't do it.

13:01.809 --> 13:05.052
Because that's how it goes with Moco-chan, right?

13:06.783 --> 13:12.487
FUWAMOCO Congratulations on your 5th anniversary event!

13:12.547 --> 13:17.051
FUWAMOCO Congratulations!

13:17.211 --> 13:19.733
FUWAMOCO We're so so lucky to be your kouhai.

13:19.813 --> 13:26.798
FUWAMOCO And we're wishing you all the best of luck on your 5th year in hololive!

13:26.818 --> 13:32.583
FUWAMOCO A big congratulations.

13:34.701 --> 13:35.101
She did.

13:35.121 --> 13:37.042
Calli-senpai did her best.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.382
She did.

13:38.402 --> 13:38.942
Yeah.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.143
I think both were the best.

13:42.584 --> 13:45.464
Both very very good in their own ways.

13:45.484 --> 13:47.585
In their own ways, you know.

13:47.885 --> 13:48.345
Yeah.

13:48.905 --> 13:50.126
Mococo split suit!

13:50.146 --> 13:52.247
Do you wanna kill Moco-chan?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.207
I can do the splits.

13:54.037 --> 13:54.898
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

13:54.918 --> 13:56.720
I'm right Mococo!

13:56.740 --> 13:57.221
I'm left Mococo!

13:57.321 --> 13:59.303
I'm not Fuwawa!

14:14.796 --> 14:17.658
Together we make FUWAMOCO.

14:17.678 --> 14:20.901
And together we make FUWAMOCO.

14:21.802 --> 14:27.346
It's gonna get awkward and then everyone's like, are they twins or are they twin boys or what?

14:27.526 --> 14:28.667
What's going on here?

14:28.687 --> 14:32.990
Please don't make Moco-chan do the Spitzelkin Ruffin.

14:33.171 --> 14:34.412
Please do not.

14:34.572 --> 14:37.194
To crash and fight and carry someone.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.123
BAU BAU!

14:41.044 --> 14:42.826
We'll have BAUKANOKO!

14:42.946 --> 14:43.186
What?

14:43.306 --> 14:43.366
No!

14:43.386 --> 14:48.432
I want to combine the BAUKANOKO together to make Mococo!

14:49.213 --> 14:49.714
BAUKANOKO!

14:49.734 --> 14:49.874
Yeah.

14:49.914 --> 14:50.074
But!

14:50.114 --> 14:52.197
That's not every exciting news!

14:52.637 --> 14:52.818
Oh!

14:53.078 --> 14:55.461
Speaking of new bodies!

14:56.942 --> 15:01.625
Ah, I didn't think I'd be talking about new bodies, but here we are!

15:02.105 --> 15:02.265
Hi!

15:02.305 --> 15:02.985
Wow!

15:03.205 --> 15:05.206
A very special senpai!

15:05.306 --> 15:05.667
Right!

15:05.687 --> 15:07.688
A very special senpai!

15:08.208 --> 15:12.210
She just announced a release of a brand new 3D body!

15:12.290 --> 15:12.970
Yay!

15:13.351 --> 15:15.492
And because she doesn't split anything, don't be confused.

15:15.512 --> 15:15.592
No!

15:15.632 --> 15:15.692

15:21.355 --> 15:21.835
No!

15:21.915 --> 15:22.035
No!

15:22.055 --> 15:22.115
No!

15:22.135 --> 15:22.175
No!

15:22.195 --> 15:22.235
No!

15:22.395 --> 15:22.495
No!

15:22.515 --> 15:22.575
No!

15:22.595 --> 15:22.635
No!

15:22.655 --> 15:22.695
No!

15:22.715 --> 15:22.775
No!

15:22.795 --> 15:22.875
No!

15:22.895 --> 15:22.955
No!

15:22.975 --> 15:23.115
No!

15:23.176 --> 15:23.456
No!

15:23.536 --> 15:23.596
No!

15:23.616 --> 15:23.676
No!

15:23.696 --> 15:23.776
No!

15:23.796 --> 15:23.896
No!

15:23.916 --> 15:24.136
No!

15:24.156 --> 15:24.196
No!

15:24.216 --> 15:24.356
No!

15:24.396 --> 15:24.436
No!

15:24.456 --> 15:24.556
No!

15:24.596 --> 15:24.656
No!

15:24.676 --> 15:24.736
No!

15:24.776 --> 15:24.836
No!

15:24.856 --> 15:24.936
No!

15:24.976 --> 15:25.137
No!

15:25.157 --> 15:25.197
No!

15:25.217 --> 15:25.257
No!

15:25.277 --> 15:25.317
No!

15:25.397 --> 15:25.457
No!

15:25.497 --> 15:25.617
No!

15:25.637 --> 15:25.677
No!

15:25.697 --> 15:25.737
No

15:26.632 --> 15:30.335
We got noisier than FUWAMOCO and we can get a lot more noisier!

15:30.395 --> 15:34.059
Especially when talking about Morning Deja Vu's new body!

15:34.079 --> 15:42.446
And the new body is also the same new body as the body that my 3D Papa gave me!

15:42.486 --> 15:45.408
So we have the same new body but it's just kinda different!

15:45.488 --> 15:47.030
That's not it at all!

15:47.230 --> 15:47.890
It's really noisy!

15:52.020 --> 15:53.201
Papa is the same.

15:53.221 --> 15:54.461
Okay?

15:54.942 --> 16:00.945
The papa is the same, okay?

16:02.366 --> 16:04.367
We can be noisy too!

16:04.507 --> 16:06.408
Have you watched this before?

16:06.468 --> 16:13.351
Ruffians, did you take a look?

16:14.292 --> 16:15.873
Very very cute!

16:15.933 --> 16:19.094
If you haven't seen it... De-den!

16:19.274 --> 16:19.675
I see!

16:20.593 --> 16:22.717
That looks pretty seventeen, don't it?

16:22.738 --> 16:26.746
You say it like you wasn't seventeen before, huh?

16:27.167 --> 16:27.828
I was!

16:28.008 --> 16:29.411
Wow!

16:29.491 --> 16:30.293
Very cute!

16:30.333 --> 16:31.415
Look at that leg!

16:34.453 --> 16:34.733
Thank you.

16:57.585 --> 16:58.326
Wow!

16:58.466 --> 16:58.666
Hi!

17:17.139 --> 17:17.539
Wow!

17:17.579 --> 17:22.202
Marine-senchou-senpai unveiled a new music video!

17:22.262 --> 17:27.305
Music video of an original song called Paipai Kamen de Dou Desuka?

17:27.585 --> 17:29.766
How about Paipai Mask?

17:30.767 --> 17:31.667
It's amazing!

17:31.767 --> 17:32.548
So shiny!

17:32.588 --> 17:34.169
So blue and so sparkly!

17:34.529 --> 17:35.709
Everything's everywhere!

17:35.829 --> 17:38.311
Very Marine-senchou-senpai!

17:38.531 --> 17:39.531
Very cute!

17:39.631 --> 17:40.072
Wow!

17:40.472 --> 17:43.474
Just wow in a music video format.

17:43.794 --> 17:44.814
It was sexy.

17:50.609 --> 17:54.499
If you're expecting masks and pie pie.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.514
You're probably expecting it.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.195
Yeah.

18:00.255 --> 18:01.436
So go check it out!

18:01.456 --> 18:02.897
Yeah!

18:03.337 --> 18:03.617
But!

18:03.677 --> 18:05.418
But not just an original song!

18:05.438 --> 18:08.340
It's an amazing music video and amazing 3D body!

18:08.380 --> 18:09.360
Not just that!

18:09.400 --> 18:10.781
You can't stop it!

18:11.482 --> 18:18.846
Marine-senchou-senpai wanted to surprise us even more with her very first solo concert!

18:18.946 --> 18:20.087
And not just one day!

18:20.107 --> 18:20.747
Not one day.

18:21.147 --> 18:23.329
It's two days!

18:23.969 --> 18:25.270
Two days!

18:25.390 --> 18:25.470
And...

18:26.527 --> 18:29.529
Ruffians, I wanna- How can we go watch?

18:29.709 --> 18:30.830
I wanna go watch!

18:31.330 --> 18:32.751
I wanna be there!

18:32.771 --> 18:34.453
But it's not just two days.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.834
It's not just two days.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.035
Arena two days!

18:38.215 --> 18:38.976
Arena!

18:39.056 --> 18:41.217
K-Arena Yokohama!

18:41.318 --> 18:41.818
Hai!

18:42.358 --> 18:45.741
That's a 20,000 capacity.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.122
Two days.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.222
Two days of that.

18:49.103 --> 18:49.543
Huh?!

18:54.134 --> 18:57.175
I love to have such amazing senpai!

18:57.235 --> 18:58.376
Oh my gosh!

18:58.876 --> 19:01.817
Yeah, that's crazy!

19:02.718 --> 19:03.918
Two days.

19:03.978 --> 19:04.158
Yeah, 20,000!

19:04.638 --> 19:05.599
Yeah, and I don't know!

19:05.639 --> 19:07.159
I need to go to both days!

19:07.259 --> 19:09.020
I need to go to both days!

19:09.761 --> 19:10.901
I'm finishing my account.

19:14.159 --> 19:14.819
Yeah!

19:14.959 --> 19:19.581
But we're so happy and so excited for Marine-senchou-senpai!

19:19.681 --> 19:22.462
It's gonna be absolutely amazing!

19:22.522 --> 19:23.242
Yeah!

19:23.342 --> 19:29.884
I don't know, it's just... You know, when you see Marine-senchou-senpai doing these amazing things... We're just like, how...

19:30.244 --> 19:30.965
How?!

19:31.365 --> 19:35.086
I like to... I like to even be... What's it?

19:35.646 --> 19:36.266
One-tenth.

19:36.646 --> 19:37.507
Yeah!

19:37.687 --> 19:39.667
One-tenth.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.348
It's amazing.

19:43.568 --> 19:44.649
But we'll get there!

19:45.069 --> 19:49.012
One day we'll be big senpai just like Marine-senchou-senpai!

19:49.053 --> 19:52.695
We'll work our hardest so that maybe we can be one tenth someday.

19:53.216 --> 19:55.878
And we'll be cheering her on lots and lots!

19:56.338 --> 19:58.901
Good luck Marine-senchou-senpai!

19:59.061 --> 20:01.523
Omedetou!

20:01.623 --> 20:03.744
BAU BAU!

20:03.764 --> 20:06.607
I think we were pretty noisy just now, right?

20:08.295 --> 20:08.595
BAU BAU!

20:08.615 --> 20:11.236
We'll continue working hard.

20:11.357 --> 20:15.718
Cuz we're working hard.

20:22.057 --> 20:22.457
But!

20:24.059 --> 20:29.002
Back to some other exciting news!

20:29.443 --> 20:32.405
Nerissa Alvarez!

20:32.865 --> 20:38.490
She just made her debut in holography!

20:38.730 --> 20:40.972
Did you watch it, Ruffians?

20:41.372 --> 20:43.413
What is holography?

20:48.437 --> 20:53.522
Well, it's a special anime that's hosted on the hololive official YouTube account.

20:55.024 --> 20:57.346
And every week there's a new episode.

20:57.366 --> 21:03.752
And for the past few weeks, Advent has been making their debuts in hologram.

21:04.073 --> 21:06.335
Ruffians, you've been watching them, right?

21:06.455 --> 21:09.818
Yeah, Shiori and Biboo have got these too.

21:11.279 --> 21:12.379
Oh, what did you think?

21:12.439 --> 21:13.360
What did you think?

21:13.380 --> 21:14.640
I haven't seen Nerissa.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.560
Go, go, go!

21:15.580 --> 21:17.021
Go check it out!

21:17.061 --> 21:21.322
Yeah, it just came out, so it's brand new, fresh Nerissa.

21:21.342 --> 21:24.882
Fresh Nerissa!

21:25.282 --> 21:31.344
You know, it's been really amazing watching them and seeing everyone come to life in hololive.

21:31.804 --> 21:35.345
You know, they captured their personalities and everything so well.

21:35.365 --> 21:36.765
Oh, Nerissa!

21:36.865 --> 21:38.766
She just aired yesterday!

21:39.146 --> 21:40.206
You can see nice.

21:40.946 --> 21:46.492
Her nose and clothes all together with Oshino Kiara-senpai and Marisencho-senpai.

21:46.552 --> 21:48.895
Singing like a demon of sound wave!

21:49.936 --> 21:55.281
If you don't know what that sounds like, you're good to go!

21:55.301 --> 21:56.242
Go check it out!

21:57.063 --> 21:57.303
Okay!

21:57.323 --> 21:58.785
Liquid comes out from the ears.

22:00.414 --> 22:02.536
I didn't know liquid comes out from your ears.

22:02.736 --> 22:03.936
You have to go see a doctor.

22:04.077 --> 22:04.777
Just in case.

22:05.037 --> 22:06.818
I think the liquid should stay in the ears.

22:06.838 --> 22:10.201
I think it should too, but... Well, since it's a demon of sound, you know.

22:10.581 --> 22:11.582
Yeah, soup ears.

22:11.802 --> 22:12.302
Yeah.

22:13.443 --> 22:16.805
Luna, when you eat soup, it doesn't go to your tummy, it goes to your ears!

22:18.488 --> 22:19.068
Apparently.

22:19.088 --> 22:28.054
Well, you know, it's Shiori and Biboo and now Nerissa that all made their whole grand debut.

22:29.034 --> 22:30.115
I guess that's everyone.

22:32.997 --> 22:40.721
Well, I was gonna say, you know, that might kind of mean that that's everyone.

22:41.542 --> 22:42.562
That's everyone.

22:42.682 --> 22:43.383
It stops there.

22:44.617 --> 22:45.978
Where's Pero?

22:46.799 --> 22:49.721
I think you should get ready for disappointment then.

22:49.941 --> 22:53.504
Maybe that might be now?

22:53.704 --> 22:55.286
FUWAMOCO!

22:55.306 --> 22:57.808
FUWAMOCO might be soon!

23:00.430 --> 23:02.431
I'm really nervous, Ruffians!

23:03.617 --> 23:08.982
Ruffians, please BAU BAU lots of special messages for us in the comments, okay?

23:09.002 --> 23:09.182
Okay!

23:09.202 --> 23:12.225
We're gonna do our best, okay?

23:12.245 --> 23:13.326
We're looking forward to it!

23:13.366 --> 23:13.726
BAU BAU!

23:28.180 --> 23:31.444
Lots of exciting things going on!

23:31.784 --> 23:33.566
Keep on coming more and more!

23:33.626 --> 23:35.869
On a topic of horror!

23:36.349 --> 23:38.912
H-O-L-O-G-R-E.

23:39.293 --> 23:43.818
There's something.

23:44.278 --> 23:45.920
You make a little bit of a typo.

23:46.461 --> 23:48.183
Just make a typo and you have something new.

23:48.840 --> 23:53.782
Something new kind of like hololive GTA!

23:53.922 --> 23:56.663
Oh wow!

23:56.723 --> 24:00.204
Mika-chan-senpai and Sui-chan-senpai just announced!

24:00.925 --> 24:01.345
De-den!

24:01.965 --> 24:03.866
hololive GTA!

24:04.406 --> 24:08.988
It's a huge project between all branches of hololive.

24:09.368 --> 24:10.388
You know, JP, ID, EN.

24:10.568 --> 24:12.949
And the fight is week long!

24:15.430 --> 24:15.630
And!

24:16.090 --> 24:21.632
Well, you know, we're all gonna go into the world of Holosanto.

24:21.752 --> 24:21.852
Yes!

24:22.112 --> 24:25.993
For a bit of an explanation, so this is roleplay.

24:26.693 --> 24:27.073
Yeah!

24:27.253 --> 24:27.754
Okay!

24:29.014 --> 24:33.395
And there's also a limited duration, so it only goes for a week.

24:33.955 --> 24:41.718
And the server is only open from 7pm GST to 1am GST.

24:42.378 --> 24:42.938
So that's...

24:44.911 --> 24:45.993
3am PT.

24:46.094 --> 24:48.980
Yeah.

24:50.002 --> 24:52.087
And then, you know, tonight we have PT.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.430
After FUWAMOCO Morning.

24:55.810 --> 25:01.254
But you know, for a bit more of an explanation, there's a bunch of different teams.

25:01.294 --> 25:11.282
So there's the gang team, the police team, medic team, mechanic team, and civilians and services, and of course the host.

25:11.362 --> 25:13.043
Ruffians, what do you think?

25:13.063 --> 25:17.286
Which team is FUWAMOCO on higher?

25:24.170 --> 25:24.911
Mechanical?

25:24.951 --> 25:25.491
No, no, no.

25:25.532 --> 25:26.713
Not the mechanic.

25:26.753 --> 25:27.654
Not the mechanic.

25:29.296 --> 25:29.356
Oh!

25:31.255 --> 25:31.575
Yeah!

25:31.695 --> 25:33.836
Medical Camp!

25:33.856 --> 25:35.617
We're playing the QQ time!

25:35.657 --> 25:43.500
The QQ time we're gonna save everybody and be really QQ while we relax them and heal them.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.181
And do all the things that make them feel better inside.

25:47.241 --> 25:50.322
The top medic is Fubuki-senpai!

25:50.382 --> 25:55.584
So we're gonna do our best to make Fubuki-senpai feel smart.

25:55.924 --> 25:58.545
And then, you know, no mistakes.

25:59.849 --> 26:04.854
And then hopefully, you know, we'll see how we decide to pass the time all together.

26:05.375 --> 26:09.619
There's lots of different things you can do together for fun, right?

26:12.205 --> 26:13.046
Yes!

26:13.086 --> 26:15.868
But we're going to be playing the entire week.

26:16.008 --> 26:16.108
Yes!

26:16.128 --> 26:25.734
And we're going to be doing our best because this time, this is the very first time that our paws have ever touched the GTA game ever ever ever ever ever.

26:25.754 --> 26:28.655
We don't know what to expect at all.

26:28.896 --> 26:29.156
No.

26:29.516 --> 26:33.158
We have not seen anything GTA.

26:33.178 --> 26:33.218
No.

26:34.239 --> 26:35.920
I don't know what's possible in the game.

26:37.610 --> 26:40.491
And we feel washed up.

26:41.151 --> 26:44.192
So we're gonna do our best!

26:44.272 --> 26:48.234
It looks like real life!

26:48.254 --> 26:52.595
We're gonna do our best to heal everybody.

26:52.615 --> 26:54.576
There's a lot of buttons.

26:54.976 --> 26:57.957
We don't have a driver's license.

26:58.037 --> 26:59.617
I don't know.

26:59.917 --> 27:01.438
Am I fit to be a medic?

27:03.035 --> 27:04.496
What could I do our best?

27:04.716 --> 27:13.863
But because the runtime for this server will be going past the regular time for FUWAMOCO Morning, this is the only FUWAMOCO Morning just for this week.

27:14.264 --> 27:18.046
But we will still be live here on YouTube every day!

27:19.668 --> 27:27.018
So we hope, Ruffians, that you'll come to check out how we're doing and hold us on toast and cheer us on too, okay?

27:27.398 --> 27:30.302
And also, in case you already know, MTL!

27:30.402 --> 27:35.109
I will also be back for hopefully the majority of the event.

27:35.429 --> 27:36.671
It's very long.

27:36.951 --> 27:40.213
You know there'll be JP-senpai there.

27:40.313 --> 27:41.413
ID-senpai.

27:41.513 --> 27:42.014
EN-senpai.

27:42.034 --> 27:43.995
So there's gonna be a lot going on.

27:44.055 --> 27:46.976
We're all gonna be doing our best to communicate.

27:47.176 --> 27:49.738
And it's gonna be interesting.

27:50.338 --> 27:53.079
There'll be a lot of passion going on too.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.840
Lots of passion.

27:54.860 --> 27:55.401
No crying.

27:56.641 --> 27:57.522
Maybe some cries.

27:59.483 --> 28:04.164
Please cheer us on and follow us on Twitter!

28:04.224 --> 28:06.325
That is a guarantee.

28:06.805 --> 28:10.026
BAU BAU!

28:10.046 --> 28:15.007
I'm looking forward to having a bunch of fun with all of you guys.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.187
It'll be wholesome.

28:16.687 --> 28:18.087
But Ruffians!

28:19.268 --> 28:20.508
It's the beginning of the week!

28:21.088 --> 28:21.988
It's a Monday!

28:22.008 --> 28:23.969
And Ruffians!

28:26.898 --> 28:30.780
It's been a little while, but I think it's that time of the week!

28:31.681 --> 28:35.663
And after, it's been a really really long time Moco-chan.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.404
I think it's back!

28:38.944 --> 28:39.725
Natto!

28:40.085 --> 28:40.985
It's back!

28:42.606 --> 28:49.249
And it's time to see just how much Moco-chan's been practicing and overcoming natto!

28:49.450 --> 28:50.010
Right?

28:50.750 --> 28:51.850
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:52.571 --> 28:55.112
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.693
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:57.753 --> 29:00.073
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.554
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

29:01.594 --> 29:02.934
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

29:20.677 --> 29:25.439
It's been a while, Moco-chan, so you should show us all the improvement you've made, right?

29:25.459 --> 29:28.800
Do I have sesame oil?

29:29.000 --> 29:29.320
No!

29:29.940 --> 29:31.060
Advent Ruffians!

29:31.221 --> 29:39.263
After watching Moco-chan do amazingly, even more amazing than last time, you'll be ready to challenge something new this week, right?

29:40.104 --> 29:40.584
Right!

29:42.324 --> 29:47.166
And that's why Moco-chan's gonna do her best to eat more natto this morning!

29:47.866 --> 29:49.147
I don't have water!

29:52.449 --> 29:59.415
There's a very special reason for this other than, you know, you could just hear improvement over a large period of time, right Moco-chan?

29:59.455 --> 29:59.955
You know.

30:05.871 --> 30:12.677
Wow, there was a Ruffian we spoke to doing a whole meat recently.

30:12.697 --> 30:20.183
And he said that they really miss seeing Moco-chan do her best to conquer eating natto.

30:20.804 --> 30:28.230
So that's why today, we're checking in on Moco-chan to see just how good she is at eating natto now.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.432
Now every time you do a whole meat.

30:31.092 --> 30:33.556
Ruffians gonna be like, OI!

30:33.616 --> 30:34.717
I- I'm so sad!

30:34.817 --> 30:39.925
FUWAMOCO CAN'T- MOCO-CHAN DOESN'T EVEN HAVE NO CHALLENGES ANYMORE!

30:39.985 --> 30:40.365
Yeah.

30:41.827 --> 30:44.912
And then they'll be like, oh well, I guess.

30:46.493 --> 30:49.194
I love it when you put it like that.

30:49.294 --> 30:51.374
Yeah, I love it the most.

30:51.394 --> 30:54.875
Maybe this is your first time hearing about natto.

30:55.295 --> 30:58.996
Natto is a very healthy, common breakfast food in Japan.

30:59.076 --> 31:00.076
It's a super food.

31:00.436 --> 31:01.556
It's very good for you.

31:01.616 --> 31:03.296
Very rich in vitamins.

31:03.776 --> 31:08.337
As for me, I love eating it happily everyday.

31:08.457 --> 31:11.118
Moco-chan, you want to become like your older sister, right?

31:14.135 --> 31:14.536
We're twins!

31:14.556 --> 31:15.356
We're twins!

31:19.777 --> 31:20.537
Henzutsu ni yokikamo.

31:20.577 --> 31:21.497
You can't just say that!

31:21.737 --> 31:22.478
You can't just say that!

31:22.498 --> 31:22.998
You can't just say that!

31:23.438 --> 31:24.118
You can't just say that!

31:24.138 --> 31:25.058
You can't just say that!

31:25.118 --> 31:25.738
You can't just say that!

31:25.778 --> 31:26.719
You can't just say that!

31:26.739 --> 31:27.259
You can't just say that!

31:27.299 --> 31:27.899
You can't just say that!

31:27.919 --> 31:28.479
You can't just say that!

31:28.499 --> 31:29.599
You can't just say that!

31:29.639 --> 31:30.379
You can't just say that!

31:30.439 --> 31:31.179
You can't just say that!

31:31.200 --> 31:32.660
You can't just say that!

31:32.700 --> 31:33.560
You can't just say that!

31:33.580 --> 31:34.260
You can't just say that!

31:34.320 --> 31:35.360
You can't just say that!

31:35.380 --> 31:36.161
You can't just say that!

31:36.181 --> 31:36.781
You can't just say that!

31:36.801 --> 31:37.801
You can't just say that!

31:37.841 --> 31:38.401
You can't just say that!

31:38.421 --> 31:38.941
You can't just say that!

31:38.961 --> 31:39.701
You can't just say that!

31:39.721 --> 31:40.802
You can't just say that!

31:40.862 --> 31:41.502
You can't just say that!

31:41.522 --> 31:42.342
You can't just say that!

31:42.362 --> 31:42.982
You can't just say that!

31:43.022 --> 31:43.842
You can't just say that!

31:43.882 --> 31:44.642
You can't just say that!

31:44.682 --> 31:46.263
You can't just say that!

31:46.283 --> 31:46.923
You can't just say

31:48.018 --> 31:48.758
Okay!

31:48.798 --> 31:52.919
Moco-chan, what are you making those sounds for?

31:52.959 --> 31:55.760
You were making them right!

31:56.660 --> 31:57.020
Well!

31:57.040 --> 31:58.140
Okay Moco-chan!

31:58.160 --> 31:59.941
It was really stringy today.

32:00.901 --> 32:09.563
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Canada and the United States of America who worked hard to make this!

32:12.082 --> 32:14.545
I'm still not Torchigi, Ruffians.

32:14.945 --> 32:15.305
Yeah.

32:15.866 --> 32:16.146
Why?

32:16.467 --> 32:17.608
The last time I had Torchigi.

32:17.628 --> 32:18.088
Not here.

32:19.069 --> 32:20.911
Now we're closer to Torchigi.

32:21.311 --> 32:22.112
I'm not here.

32:22.873 --> 32:23.313
Yeah.

32:24.054 --> 32:24.935
Okay!

32:25.175 --> 32:26.537
Wow, Moco-chan!

32:27.117 --> 32:29.500
Itadakimasu!

32:31.181 --> 32:32.683
That's one bean, Moco-chan.

32:32.703 --> 32:33.604
That's one bean.

32:33.624 --> 32:34.285
What are you doing?

32:37.762 --> 32:39.303
What are you doing, Moco-chan?

32:39.343 --> 32:42.985
Where's that strong demon dog that we saw a few months ago?

32:43.045 --> 32:43.705
Huh?

32:43.825 --> 32:44.245
Huh?

32:45.206 --> 32:45.926
Huh?

32:46.626 --> 32:48.907
Only once we've cleared the challenge.

32:48.927 --> 32:48.987
Why?

32:49.067 --> 32:52.069
Why'd I get back into the group?

32:52.289 --> 32:54.009
I don't know.

32:54.830 --> 32:55.470
Stand with the eyes.

32:55.670 --> 32:56.571
Definitely not stand.

32:56.671 --> 32:57.511
I stand it!

32:57.831 --> 32:58.992
I stand it, look!

32:59.352 --> 33:02.693
Moco-chan, why are you making it sound like you're eating it when you're clearly not?

33:02.713 --> 33:05.355
I'm trying to get it on my tongue.

33:05.375 --> 33:05.735
Okay.

33:07.541 --> 33:08.222
Huh?

33:09.826 --> 33:09.926
Oh!

33:10.126 --> 33:10.227
Oh!

33:10.728 --> 33:10.968
Oh!

33:11.309 --> 33:11.810
The tongue!

33:11.870 --> 33:12.551
The tongue!

33:12.652 --> 33:13.874
I can't tell if it's tight!

33:13.894 --> 33:15.037
The tongue petted me!

33:19.918 --> 33:25.640
It couldn't have to do a bit better than that.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.360
It didn't go.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.141
It didn't drop from the chopsticks.

33:30.101 --> 33:28.141
3, 2.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.362
Oh, 3, 2.

33:32.402 --> 33:38.684
Moco-chan, that is nowhere close to eating.

33:38.704 --> 33:42.245
It's not supposed to be like that.

33:42.826 --> 33:44.126
It fell out, though.

33:44.506 --> 33:46.447
It fell out of the mouth.

33:47.670 --> 33:50.131
Moco-chan, you ready to eat more beans?

33:53.591 --> 33:55.512
Can I just hide it under my tongue?

33:55.552 --> 33:59.673
No, if it's gonna be this pathetic, we're gonna have to start from scratch again.

33:59.693 --> 34:02.853
I'm gonna hide it under my tongue.

34:04.514 --> 34:05.074
Oh my god!

34:05.154 --> 34:06.194
Oh, oh, it's on the teeth?

34:07.074 --> 34:07.635
I know it!

34:11.491 --> 34:12.552
Moco-chan.

34:14.053 --> 34:23.381
It was not a good idea to hide it under the tongue.

34:23.581 --> 34:24.021
No.

34:24.041 --> 34:26.943
Moco-chan.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.164
There's no milk.

34:29.245 --> 34:30.586
It's not gonna help with the taste.

34:30.606 --> 34:32.348
I feel like they're squishier.

34:32.368 --> 34:34.850
They're not squishier.

34:40.137 --> 34:41.498
Why should she hide it?

34:41.538 --> 34:42.779
That was her strategy.

34:42.899 --> 34:45.660
I didn't tell her it would work.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.361
Okay, Moco-chan.

34:46.541 --> 34:48.082
You have 5 seconds.

34:48.182 --> 34:53.605
I thought they said that there's no taste receptacles underneath the tongue.

34:53.625 --> 34:53.605
2!

34:53.645 --> 34:54.886
1!

34:54.305 --> 34:54.886
Okay.

34:55.706 --> 34:56.226
No!

34:56.567 --> 34:58.027
What are you doing?

34:58.128 --> 34:59.468
Okay, that is done.

34:59.488 --> 34:59.548
Eat.

35:00.069 --> 35:00.169
Eat.

35:00.329 --> 35:00.769
Chew.

35:00.809 --> 35:01.089
Chew.

35:01.349 --> 35:01.610
Chew.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.111
Yum yum yum yum yum.

35:04.131 --> 35:05.192
Yum yum yum yum.

35:05.212 --> 35:06.933
Yum yum yum yum yum.

35:10.157 --> 35:11.418
Meow meow meow.

35:11.778 --> 35:17.360
Moco-chan!

35:18.021 --> 35:18.801
Moco-chan!

35:18.821 --> 35:20.602
Sudden attack!

35:20.642 --> 35:21.982
Sudden attack, Moco-chan!

35:22.002 --> 35:27.825
Moco-chan!

35:27.865 --> 35:28.325
Go for it!

35:28.485 --> 35:28.965
Go for it!

35:40.147 --> 35:40.407
No!

35:41.248 --> 35:42.168
No, no, no!

35:42.248 --> 35:43.629
Do I have a cough drop?

35:43.709 --> 35:45.910
What is the big deal?

35:46.050 --> 35:49.111
What is it, Moco-chan?

35:49.691 --> 35:50.912
Wow, Ruffians.

35:51.352 --> 35:56.675
I think we really have to go back to the beginning.

35:56.775 --> 35:59.196
Oh, my tears.

35:59.276 --> 36:00.877
Moco-chan!

36:00.897 --> 36:01.677
I tried!

36:03.398 --> 36:04.598
Tears of hard work.

36:05.239 --> 36:07.440
I tried.

36:08.802 --> 36:10.303
FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

36:10.543 --> 36:12.063
I just want you to taste!

36:12.703 --> 36:13.204
Moco-chan!

36:13.224 --> 36:16.725
Moco-chan did her best to try to eat one piadato today.

36:17.765 --> 36:19.106
And she put her all into it.

36:19.326 --> 36:21.947
So you can do your best challenge something new.

36:22.027 --> 36:23.287
I put your all into it.

36:23.327 --> 36:25.128
Maybe it might take some tears too.

36:26.188 --> 36:26.749
It's okay.

36:27.029 --> 36:27.689
It happens.

36:27.829 --> 36:29.490
BAU BAU!

36:30.190 --> 36:31.851
BAU BAU!

36:33.271 --> 36:34.031
Moco-chan!

36:34.532 --> 36:37.152
Next... Next we're gonna go take a look at the doggy.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.133
Are you ready?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.672
Look at today's Doggie of the Day!

36:46.692 --> 36:53.613
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

36:53.753 --> 36:54.133
It's De-den!

36:54.173 --> 36:54.673
FUWAMOCO!

36:54.693 --> 37:00.614
I think it's been about a year now since we last saw De-den!

37:00.834 --> 37:01.274
So cute!

37:01.314 --> 37:03.174
Happy Christmas De-den!

37:03.214 --> 37:04.095
Happy Christmas!

37:04.135 --> 37:06.575
That's so happy!

37:06.615 --> 37:07.775
What a good girl!

37:12.816 --> 37:17.080
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

37:29.329 --> 37:31.952
Moco-chan, how does that BAU BAU?

37:49.120 --> 37:51.402
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

38:05.472 --> 38:06.993
Wait, that's a bad noise!

38:07.033 --> 38:07.133
Ren!

38:07.193 --> 38:07.673
Ren!

38:08.154 --> 38:10.015
She's the Doggie of the Day today!

38:10.355 --> 38:10.455
Good!

38:10.995 --> 38:12.376
Yeah, I forgot!

38:12.456 --> 38:14.277
Ren, she's so cute!

38:14.697 --> 38:17.939
She's been by your side for so long!

38:17.959 --> 38:18.039
Yeah!

38:18.539 --> 38:19.680
I just love how soft she is!

38:19.720 --> 38:23.122
Yeah, you could just dig your fingers right in there, huh?

38:23.482 --> 38:23.642
Yeah!

38:24.082 --> 38:25.743
Today I went on a walk.

38:50.447 --> 38:53.049
We are out de-den!

39:08.442 --> 39:15.367
I guess you know, well it's some sort of plant that has a tendency to make everything look very golden just like you!

39:15.707 --> 39:18.269
It looks delicious.

39:18.329 --> 39:25.255
I feel like if I walked through that field I'd end up looking golden too.

39:25.595 --> 39:29.338
This looks like an amazing final summer walk, right?

39:29.478 --> 39:31.840
It's the perfect way to end off the summer time.

39:35.050 --> 39:39.955
Well, we hope that you not even let the summer walks come to an end here.

39:40.276 --> 39:42.318
That you'll start to enjoy the fall walks too!

39:42.438 --> 39:45.181
Different type of fall.

39:45.241 --> 39:47.083
It's not good for pollen allergies.

39:48.184 --> 39:50.086
Well, maybe we'll get to see you by then.

39:50.106 --> 39:52.849
I'll see you when!

39:53.009 --> 39:55.051
BAU BAU!

39:56.812 --> 40:02.116
Next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

40:02.376 --> 40:04.598
Hi FUWAMOCO!

40:04.798 --> 40:12.964
Over the last one year, you two have proven to be the strongest puppies I've ever known.

40:13.404 --> 40:19.889
You've always tried to bring a smile to our faces despite all the difficulties, hardships, and sickness.

40:20.609 --> 40:22.090
I really admire you.

40:22.430 --> 40:24.911
Can you tell me how to become strong like you?

40:24.991 --> 40:36.936
Well, I think Ruffians, you know, we try really, really, really hard to be as strong as possible in front of you, you know?

40:36.956 --> 40:41.037
Because, you know, we want to protect your smile as much as we can.

40:41.598 --> 40:44.139
And you know, we know that things are rough for you.

40:45.205 --> 40:48.146
But you know, we also have hard times too!

40:48.546 --> 40:53.848
And we try really hard to get through them without you noticing sometimes.

40:55.108 --> 40:59.290
And sometimes we probably do better than other times.

41:00.710 --> 41:04.772
But that's just because, Ruffians, we don't want you to worry at all!

41:07.019 --> 41:14.404
We think the best way to get stronger is to just believe in yourself and your dreams.

41:15.004 --> 41:19.707
And also maybe be a bit silly hot.

41:20.507 --> 41:21.248
Stubborn.

41:22.148 --> 41:24.490
Stubborn, silly, all that stuff.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.211
All of that.

41:28.412 --> 41:29.593
Does that answer the question?

41:30.695 --> 41:31.095
I don't know.

41:31.135 --> 41:31.676
BAU BAU!

41:31.716 --> 41:36.299
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

41:36.359 --> 41:41.022
Thank you for all your submissions to FUWAMOCO Morning today!

41:41.122 --> 41:53.551
Remember, if you have any works that you've been on recently, a Doggie of the Day, maybe a question to send us, or you happen to run into Pero, please, please send us it with the hashtag!

41:53.951 --> 41:55.392
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

41:57.533 --> 42:01.877
That's the important part of FUWAMOCO Morning, so please let us include G.O.K.!

42:01.897 --> 42:04.179
BAU BAU!

42:04.199 --> 42:10.025
For our next stream, we have host G.G.A.!

42:10.045 --> 42:12.567
We're really looking forward to it!

42:15.790 --> 42:18.211
Let's go into the world of Holosatos.

42:18.651 --> 42:22.332
You know, do our best at our brand new job being a Maddix.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.373
And being all together with all our senpais.

42:25.533 --> 42:27.234
So many senpais!

42:27.734 --> 42:29.494
I feel like it's gonna be very busy.

42:29.754 --> 42:33.236
It's gonna be a whole new experience for us Ruffians.

42:33.276 --> 42:35.076
So please be there!

42:35.096 --> 42:37.197
Let's have a lot of fun together, okay?

42:38.157 --> 42:39.278
BAU BAU!

42:53.234 --> 42:55.455
FUWAMOCO Morning!

43:14.788 --> 43:16.289
Are you excited, Ruffians?

43:16.309 --> 43:19.610
It's gonna be a new experience for us!

43:19.750 --> 43:23.231
Please be there, okay?

43:23.731 --> 43:25.812
We're gonna do our best for now.

43:26.212 --> 43:32.594
And on Saturday evening, we're doing the Voice of Mimicry show, the Koei Maneki Gou!

43:32.834 --> 43:34.935
We're gonna make a bunch of sounds.

43:35.375 --> 43:37.036
Because we're good at making sounds!

43:37.476 --> 43:39.396
And that way we can win prizes, right?

43:41.537 --> 43:48.661
We make a lot of unique sounds sometimes.

43:48.721 --> 43:50.482
Sometimes it can be surprising.

43:51.943 --> 43:53.824
And you know what?

43:53.844 --> 43:55.405
We make the sound at the same time.

43:55.445 --> 43:57.747
You can see how similar our sounds sounds like.

43:58.287 --> 43:59.348
FUWAMOCO!

44:13.976 --> 44:22.220
And then on Sunday evening, we're gonna be able to talk a bunch about doggy packs all of a sudden!

44:22.300 --> 44:25.441
It's been one year since our doggy pack came to be!

44:25.461 --> 44:30.683
And we're super excited to be able to talk about a bunch of things in the past year!

44:31.104 --> 44:35.966
It's been a little while, so we're really looking forward to getting nice and comfy and cozy again!

44:36.086 --> 44:43.049
I know it's gonna be a bit of a busy week, cause you know there's hololive today, we have the other streams too, and we have
