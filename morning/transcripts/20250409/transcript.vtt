00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:27.403
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:27.784 --> 00:05:31.388
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:33.270
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:37.475
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:41.120
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.183
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:45.805
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:50.511
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:53.096
Ruffians!

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:54.378
It's Wednesday!

00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:58.485
The middle of the week.

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:02.633
It's also our 145th episode!

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:04.276
BAU BAU!

00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:11.208
Thank you for waking up early to join us here today!

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:11.689
BAU BAU!

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:12.851
Wow!

00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.618
But those Ruffians that are joining us today for the first time!

00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:24.347
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:25.329
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.974
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:29.114 --> 00:06:30.176
You haven't forgotten, right?

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:30.596
Yeah!

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:37.727
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.372
Now, you know what I'm gonna say, right?

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:46.369
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:49.034
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:52.080
Ruffians already did the hashtag.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.081
Hashtag.

00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:55.145
BAU BAU!

00:06:56.488 --> 00:07:00.194
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.757
BAU BAU!

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:04.861
Good morning!

00:07:07.244 --> 00:07:08.225
She said the thing.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:09.727
What thing did I say?

00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:11.589
I said a lot of things.

00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:12.470
I said the thing.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.476
You know which one of us said the thing.

00:07:17.617 --> 00:07:19.919
BAU BAU!

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.703
It's a new morning, Moco-chan!

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:24.966
How are we gonna start the day off today?

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:26.007
Right?

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:31.154
On the right paw.

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:32.136
Thank you.

00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:33.197
That was the answer.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.924
Thank you.

00:07:37.944 --> 00:07:38.765
The wrong paw.

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:47.978
Wrong paw first and then we'll fix it with the right paw.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.552
De-den!

00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:01.838
Huh?

00:08:01.858 --> 00:08:01.998
Huh?

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:13.934
Well, you know, it's good to go out and enjoy the beautiful sky, but I... I don't know if I feel that motivated to go out for a walk with the sun like that.

00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:16.357
Kinda looks pretty nasty though, you know?

00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:18.240
Nasty, huh?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.500
Yeah.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.563
What do you think, hololive?

00:08:20.982 --> 00:08:22.003
He's become the sun.

00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:22.524
I know.

00:08:22.624 --> 00:08:24.165
Are we gonna let him be the sun?

00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:26.107
It's okay.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.809
Don't look directly at him.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.591
I think that's a good idea.

00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:32.054
Your eyes, they'll just be gone.

00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:35.197
The sun god, Pero.

00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:38.321
Pero's demon dog, Ruffians.

00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:40.383
In extra sunscreen.

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:41.604
It's burning!

00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:44.247
Praise the sun.

00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:46.569
What type of SPF do you need to deal with this?

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.831
Praise the sun.

00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:49.993
Praise the sun.

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:55.821
Pero... What's the last one?

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:56.382
Huh?

00:08:56.482 --> 00:08:58.005
SPF.

00:08:58.025 --> 00:08:58.185
Sun.

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:03.955
Pero... Huh?

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:06.680
What's the word?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.621
Wow, it seems like Ruffians!

00:09:08.663 --> 00:09:11.989
Well, you know you got your SPF.

00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.116
You know, as long, I guess, you know, if the sun...

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:19.913
If it makes you happy like this, you know you want to go outside.

00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:25.259
If that gets you going, get some movement into your day!

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:25.640
Exercise!

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.100
All that!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.925
I mean, I prefer it just to be the sun we're used to.

00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:34.050
But you know, maybe this way.

00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:36.994
It'll mean that summer won't be super duper hot!

00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.177
Yeah, I guess.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.681
We could allow Pero to be the sun if that's the case.

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:42.981
Yeah?

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:44.263
Maybe.

00:09:45.037 --> 00:10:03.130
BAU BAU!

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:20.786
Ruffians, would you ask Pero to put suntan lotion on you with his tongue?

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:24.831
Whatever motivates you.

00:10:25.418 --> 00:10:35.547
BAU BAU!

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.071
Hello!

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:42.854
Ruffians, this is good news!

00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:47.620
Advent, we're very close to reaching our milestone!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:58.733
Advent, our cover of Team Tomodachi is just about at 7 million views on YouTube!

00:10:58.713 --> 00:11:06.424
7 million FUWAMOCO fans!

00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:09.248
It came out about 3 months ago.

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:14.776
But I guess it's clear that you really like the Adventrix.

00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:18.901
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.967
You know, it was a very surprising song choice.

00:11:23.067 --> 00:11:28.635
But compared to my newest cover, you know where we become childish.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.725
Ai wo Torimodose!

00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:35.057
Which one do you think was more surprising, both of you?

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:36.220
Yeah, which one was more surprising?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.724
They're both pretty surprising.

00:11:37.744 --> 00:11:37.925
They are.

00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:39.409
They're shocking.

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:41.916
Oh good!

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.205
You're shocked.

00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:44.507
I don't know what this is.

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:45.729
I'm shocked.

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:47.171
Both are surprising.

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:50.837
Are you surprised anymore that Advent does this stuff?

00:11:54.622 --> 00:11:56.986
Chabu was the biggest surprise.

00:11:58.588 --> 00:11:59.790
I thought it was not so much.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.512
Definitely the buffest.

00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:03.415
Yeah.

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:10.490
JoJo!

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:16.141
It's different.

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.666
Forget the JoJo.

00:12:18.686 --> 00:12:20.931
You're already dead!

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:28.363
Fist of the North Star.

00:12:29.044 --> 00:12:34.397
Fist of the North Star!

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:47.908
FUWAMOCO we are really really happy that you're enjoying Advent so much.

00:12:47.928 --> 00:12:52.740
And we really hope to be able to release more all together soon too.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.621
Good, yes!

00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:56.645
You know, of course FUWAMOCO really likes singing.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:59.268
You know, the two of us.

00:12:59.288 --> 00:13:03.413
But, he really likes singing as a unit altogether too.

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:06.697
So, we'll continue to do our best as Advent!

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:08.539
You are in the way!

00:13:10.402 --> 00:13:17.550
And if you haven't yet, please go take another listen to Team Tomodachi!

00:13:17.571 --> 00:13:18.812
I'll tell you more about that later.

00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:37.408
It's not FUWAMOCO.

00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:46.503
But Calli-senpai, she just released a brand new song after her 3D birthday live!

00:13:46.523 --> 00:13:47.925
CPR!

00:13:48.005 --> 00:13:50.029
BAU BAU!

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:54.957
And you know Calli-senpai, her new music is always a treat, you know?

00:13:55.357 --> 00:13:58.182
Always evolving, you know?

00:13:58.162 --> 00:14:03.628
But this time, she sang together with another artist named Touboe.

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:11.357
But, you know, Kyai-senpai, she took lyrics and, you know, this time she did the lyrics together with them.

00:14:11.758 --> 00:14:13.920
But then sing it obviously.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.061
Obviously.

00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:19.967
But you know, then she's like, I'm gonna take a step forward!

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:44.503
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.547
How does her brain work?

00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:49.872
But then, you have to ask, how does her brain work?

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:55.222
But then, how does her body work?

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:59.689
I mean, shinigami are just different.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.932
Maybe shinigami are just built different.

00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:01.372
No.

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:01.953
Maybe.

00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.416
Maybe it's because you know that.

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:04.678
Shinigami.

00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:08.044
She already has a few deaths.

00:15:08.497 --> 00:15:23.593
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:36.107
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:36.087 --> 00:15:38.650
BAU BAU!

00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:41.133
Confirm Calli-senpai's built different.

00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:42.835
Yeah, we didn't do that.

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:46.780
Did you not submit asking about how Calli-senpai's body works like this?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.665
No matter how many times you ask her, she's not gonna give you the answer.

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:53.568
I don't think she knows either.

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:54.148
It's okay.

00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:55.450
It's a banger.

00:15:56.271 --> 00:16:00.576
BAU BAU!

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:03.301
She's a hard worker.

00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:06.365
Yeah, and much much more.

00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:08.507
But you know what?

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:11.511
One cool thing to the next.

00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:13.032
Maybe a bit cuter than cool.

00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:14.033
Maybe?

00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:25.526
For a little while, there's been a very cute project going on in hololive called holoWitch!

00:16:25.546 --> 00:16:25.967
Have you heard of it?

00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:26.327
Ruffians!

00:16:26.307 --> 00:16:30.393
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, what is this?

00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:31.694
Very cute!

00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.016
I like witches' hearts!

00:16:33.377 --> 00:16:35.700
Well, it's a multimedia project, you know.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.242
Manga!

00:16:37.723 --> 00:16:40.146
3D Live!

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:40.286
Anime!

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:40.426
Music!

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:42.449
Yeah, but 3D Live is so cute too!

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:49.519
But you know, our senpai, like Nicochi-senpai, Luna-senpai, you know, everybody.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.703
Everybody here, they become witches together!

00:16:52.723 --> 00:16:54.846
You know, the story kind of unfolds from there.

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:55.587
Magical girls!

00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:55.707
Yeah!

00:16:55.687 --> 00:17:02.199
There has been some changes in recent months of Koe-senpai's departure.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:07.007
Most recently Shion-senpai will be graduating at the end of this month.

00:17:08.129 --> 00:17:08.890
So, wow!

00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:11.215
There is some big news!

00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:16.564
Just today, it was announced that Fubuki-senpai and Lamy-senpai

00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:22.832
Fubuki-senpai and I are now joining as new witches!

00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:23.112
Look at them!

00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:23.453
They're so cute!

00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:25.515
And they both have their own special wands!

00:17:25.976 --> 00:17:26.156
Right!

00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:28.219
And I'm a little curious, you know.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.062
They're not like the black witches like before now.

00:17:31.443 --> 00:17:34.326
Their outfits are similar, but the colors are a bit different, right?

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:34.526
Right!

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:35.668
The tones are a bit different.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.431
I wonder what this is gonna mean, you know?

00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:38.772
Yeah!

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:41.295
The brown one's for Fubuki-senpai.

00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:43.758
The blue one's for Lamy-senpai.

00:17:44.018 --> 00:17:45.420
Gold and silver- Oh!

00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:46.849
Maybe that's like that.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:47.851
Oh!

00:17:51.035 --> 00:17:52.597
We missed that!

00:17:52.617 --> 00:17:54.179
Maybe we missed that.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.742
We just got the undertone was different, but that makes sense because it's silver.

00:17:56.822 --> 00:17:59.065
Are they gonna be extra strong?

00:17:59.366 --> 00:18:00.407
We'll have to find out.

00:18:04.332 --> 00:18:06.455
Yeah, but I'm ambitious so I'm gonna follow it.

00:18:06.475 --> 00:18:12.022
Last time, I tried to watch something.

00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:12.323
I had to stop.

00:18:12.343 --> 00:18:13.424
It's too cute, you know?

00:18:13.965 --> 00:18:14.766
I started crying.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:28.553
But you know us holo-witches, we're never quite sure what's gonna happen, what troubles we're gonna get into, how the story is going to end up.

00:18:29.173 --> 00:18:30.815
So let's keep our eyes on it.

00:18:30.835 --> 00:18:35.239
We're really excited to see the world of holo-witches grow.

00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:37.221
BAU BAU!

00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:38.643
You always cry, Mococo.

00:18:38.663 --> 00:18:39.383
No I'm not!

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:41.606
I'm not, okay?

00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:44.128
We need twin witches!

00:18:44.108 --> 00:18:47.433
I don't know, that might be too much trouble, you know?

00:18:47.553 --> 00:18:49.075
It may be mysterious, huh?

00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:51.980
Double trouble.

00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:54.283
BAU BAU!

00:18:56.587 --> 00:19:07.483
If you were taking a look, maybe a couple peeks at our Twitter today, you might have seen that, well, today we paid a little bit of a visit to the doctor.

00:19:07.463 --> 00:19:11.689
Just so you know, our breakfast checked out a little bit.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.276
You know, we felt that they've been a bit funny ever since we got sick after fast.

00:19:17.296 --> 00:19:21.863
So, you know, we wanted to get a bit of a checkup before it gets any worse.

00:19:21.883 --> 00:19:24.106
You know, it's probably a good idea.

00:19:24.126 --> 00:19:24.687
How was it?

00:19:25.628 --> 00:19:29.533
Well, you know, it's a little bit like we suspected.

00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:32.998
They're in a bit of a rough shape right now.

00:19:32.978 --> 00:19:36.885
The dog deshita de inflamed.

00:19:37.025 --> 00:19:37.846
Pretty inflamed.

00:19:38.668 --> 00:19:40.932
But don't worry Ruffians!

00:19:40.952 --> 00:19:43.536
I think there's a lot of Ruffians worried on Twitter.

00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:44.999
Please don't worry.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.623
It's not super serious or anything.

00:19:48.224 --> 00:19:50.227
We can still talk over a game.

00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:52.031
The dog deshita too.

00:19:52.732 --> 00:19:56.438
And we got a bunch of medicine too.

00:19:56.418 --> 00:20:00.008
Moco-chan, you're not excited for the medicine?

00:20:00.028 --> 00:20:00.770
Take it properly!

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.835
It's just so many different things.

00:20:02.855 --> 00:20:03.657
Yeah.

00:20:03.718 --> 00:20:04.339
There's this one.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:04.961
Wait, wait.

00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:06.124
I'm gonna count them out.

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:07.127
Okay.

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:09.032
How many questions?

00:20:09.052 --> 00:20:11.338
That one, that one, that one.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.163
There's a lot of them, there's a lot of them, yeah.

00:20:15.024 --> 00:20:16.526
And you have to take them a lot.

00:20:16.826 --> 00:20:20.091
Yeah.

00:20:20.111 --> 00:20:26.399
You know, but... It'll be all good and the barkers will be back to barking like normal soon.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.989
And Fuwawa even advised the doctor cause, you know, she's strong enough to take the bitter medicine.

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:40.397
I don't think it's really that bitter at all, so... She was like, are you okay with the bitter medicine?

00:20:41.592 --> 00:20:44.957
It's a medicine.

00:20:44.997 --> 00:20:50.023
But maybe it's a little bit more bitter than a lot of the Ruffians would expect.

00:20:50.764 --> 00:20:52.647
Is it that bitter?

00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:53.908
I don't think so.

00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:55.270
I'm used to the more bitter.

00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:56.352
The bitter medicine.

00:20:56.372 --> 00:21:00.397
The bitter, bitter medicine.

00:21:00.417 --> 00:21:00.517
Yeah.

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.022
Ways to not...

00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:05.649
Moco-chan, you had a sip?

00:21:06.471 --> 00:21:07.272
Oh, it's fine.

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:08.094
Yeah.

00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:09.917
That's so odd.

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:13.924
And this time, I didn't even... I didn't even... No.

00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:19.093
Sometimes it can be a bit tricky when a doctor checks out the barker.

00:21:19.554 --> 00:21:19.774
Yeah.

00:21:20.716 --> 00:21:22.118
I think a lot of... A bit rough.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.566
Other EN Senpai have been going making sure to see the dog too recently.

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:27.107
Get a look at that.

00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:32.758
That was really rough.

00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:34.802
Moco-chan!

00:21:35.664 --> 00:21:36.365
I'm a champ.

00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:39.131
You're a champ Moco-chan.

00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:40.594
This time I didn't even flinch.

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:42.658
I did really good this time.

00:21:42.978 --> 00:21:45.383
Not even you know when it's like...

00:21:45.363 --> 00:21:47.167
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:47.387 --> 00:22:00.013
Have a howl of a day!

00:22:00.685 --> 00:22:07.055
The doctor didn't end up any whiter than usual, right, zo?

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:11.002
So it was all good, right?

00:22:11.022 --> 00:22:11.683
Yeah!

00:22:11.703 --> 00:22:20.718
But we're really looking forward to how Borko's gonna neglect themselves again soon, so... BAU BAU!

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.761
This time...

00:22:24.158 --> 00:22:25.479
But!

00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:27.461
Ruffians!

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:33.006
You might have seen there's some exciting things happening all across Japan!

00:22:33.546 --> 00:22:39.332
Ruffians, you know, if you've ever been to Japan and you've ever heard of some of the cool things in Japan.

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:42.194
You know, konbini, the convenience stores.

00:22:42.214 --> 00:22:44.917
The mystical konbini.

00:22:45.057 --> 00:22:53.344
And you know, there's a bunch of different ones, but one of the konbini kings is Famima!

00:22:53.364 --> 00:22:54.165
Family play!

00:22:54.145 --> 00:23:04.199
Right now, there's a special, special, special collaboration going on right now.

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:06.302
Together with Meiji!

00:23:06.622 --> 00:23:08.464
About the gummies.

00:23:09.045 --> 00:23:13.111
If you get gummies, then you can take home FUWAMOCO!

00:23:14.032 --> 00:23:17.216
Like IRyS-senpai, Calli-senpai, or Bae-senpai!

00:23:17.617 --> 00:23:19.900
I know what we covered earlier!

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:29.773
You can get special clear files with us for any purchase of the specific... Specific... Specific VT-comi is good!

00:23:29.793 --> 00:23:30.214
Actually!

00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:31.555
No!

00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:41.669
If you're going to FUWAMIMA, you can find acrylic stamps and acrylic keychains outside of FUWAMOCO too!

00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:41.989
BAU BAU!

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.097
Yeah, I went to Japan!

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:50.754
So we've been seeing a bunch of Ruffians going around hunting us down.

00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:53.683
I love BAU BAU!

00:23:54.693 --> 00:23:58.578
BAU BAU!

00:23:58.598 --> 00:24:03.244
This means, you know, FUWAMOCO might not be as far as you think, you know.

00:24:04.726 --> 00:24:05.086
But!

00:24:05.907 --> 00:24:09.692
We have been seeing Ruffians going on quite an adventure, you know.

00:24:10.493 --> 00:24:15.539
To one farming map, another farming map, another farming map, and another sometimes.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.340
Six?

00:24:17.141 --> 00:24:17.922
Nine?

00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:23.890
Ruffians, we have a special cheat code for you.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:36.226
Well, if you go to the special website, which is linked on Twitter for the campaign, they do have a list of the stores across Japan that have the acrylic stands.

00:24:36.747 --> 00:24:37.788
There is a lot of them.

00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:39.670
Quite a lot of them.

00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:41.633
But it's not all of them.

00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:47.160
So maybe that makes the adventure a little bit easier.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:55.674
The website has a list of all the stores, so make sure to check it out!

00:24:55.754 --> 00:25:02.685
There are a lot of Ruffians looking for an acrylic stand.

00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:14.818
You know, that way it's a bit easier.

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:26.310
Oh, I'm going to buy this FUWAMOCO.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.894
Today, FUWAMOCO is a bit bad.

00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:31.678
Yeah, so... I didn't know the gummies were going to be delicious.

00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:32.720
So, we had a bit of a hard time, didn't we?

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.982
So, um... Thank you!

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:48.110
Thank you!

00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:48.163
Thank

00:25:48.143 --> 00:25:53.473
But they're super cute and of course you know I'm just FUWAMOCO-ing.

00:25:53.613 --> 00:25:54.354
Calli-senpai.

00:25:54.795 --> 00:25:57.420
Strong baby-senpai.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.001
Ai-senpai.

00:25:58.282 --> 00:26:00.606
With a cool energy drink too.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:04.813
And there's also small acrylic keychains as well that are blind boxes.

00:26:05.074 --> 00:26:09.422
If you feel lucky, please try your gear!

00:26:09.442 --> 00:26:10.424
We got so lucky!

00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:12.227
We got everyone.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:27.967
I think the next one, if we got the next one, Fuwawa would have been... But by the time we opened the ones we got back, he was definitely gone.

00:26:28.648 --> 00:26:33.974
But we were having a bunch of fun eating the gummies too!

00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:36.656
Moco-chan, you're hogging the bowl!

00:26:36.677 --> 00:26:40.020
I wasn't, but... I dropped them.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.855
We dropped one on the ground, and I was like, okay Moco-chan, I don't want that one.

00:26:45.135 --> 00:26:46.917
But I want a gummy, so give me a gummy.

00:26:47.378 --> 00:26:53.947
And then I was focused at looking at the cute, you know, the acrylic keychains, and I was like, oh, Kawaii-senpai!

00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:54.628
So cute!

00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:58.253
So then, I picked up the gummy.

00:27:00.936 --> 00:27:05.803
And, I put it, put it back in the bag, and I just pulled it back out and gave it to her.

00:27:08.506 --> 00:27:08.586
Yay!

00:27:08.747 --> 00:27:09.147
Oh!

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:09.788
Yummy!

00:27:09.808 --> 00:27:11.290
This is a good one!

00:27:13.008 --> 00:27:16.935
I pretended to put it back in the bag and get a different one.

00:27:18.117 --> 00:27:22.103
She wasn't paying attention.

00:27:22.123 --> 00:27:22.765
It's her fault.

00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:23.366
I can't wait to play!

00:27:23.386 --> 00:27:28.114
You know we got all these wonderful acrylic keychains with us, right?

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:29.636
I like sticking them all on.

00:27:30.077 --> 00:27:39.032
And you know, if you go on a bit of a search through a bunch of different farming mods, sometimes you find extra treasures too.

00:27:39.012 --> 00:27:47.445
Maybe like all the hololive clips, you know, of figures, other yomikomis, you know.

00:27:47.946 --> 00:27:48.727
Figures.

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:51.812
Hawaii.

00:27:53.895 --> 00:28:04.412
So we hope that my fans, if you're in Japan, if you're planning a trip to Japan, that you hit the FAMIMA and try not to find us there.

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:22.367
FUWAMOCO

00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:36.112
It's the middle of the week, Ruffians.

00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:37.876
How are you feeling?

00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:39.739
Hasn't been a good week so far.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:40.300
It's better.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.422
A busy one.

00:28:42.084 --> 00:28:43.967
Busy.

00:28:43.947 --> 00:28:45.249
Spring is starting!

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.131
Are you getting ready?

00:28:48.673 --> 00:28:49.294
It's been a while.

00:28:49.314 --> 00:28:50.456
It could be better.

00:28:50.536 --> 00:28:53.179
You've been doing alright.

00:28:53.259 --> 00:28:54.842
You have a tummy ache.

00:28:54.862 --> 00:28:56.624
Your sister got married!

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:58.827
Congratulations!

00:28:58.847 --> 00:28:59.928
I hope that means it's a good week.

00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:00.830
I hope so.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.251
Maybe it was rough for you though.

00:29:02.272 --> 00:29:03.353
My sister!

00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:08.680
But it's basically who I am!

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.381
Basically.

00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:17.714
Moco-chan, you know, maybe for some Ruffians that have been having a good week, you know, you could give them a pat on the back.

00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:24.104
Maybe for some Ruffians that have been having a little bit of a rough week, you could give them a strong pat on the back.

00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:25.586
Strong?

00:29:25.726 --> 00:29:28.010
Do you need a strong pat on the back, Ruffians?

00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:29.432
Yeah.

00:29:29.452 --> 00:29:30.333
You ate a burger?

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:30.734
Wow.

00:29:31.275 --> 00:29:31.815
It's morning.

00:29:32.376 --> 00:29:32.717
Good job.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.120
You need it?

00:29:37.985 --> 00:29:38.085
Okay!

00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:41.929
Ruffians!

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.851
It's that time again!

00:29:45.974 --> 00:29:50.801
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:29:51.782 --> 00:29:58.772
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:29:58.792 --> 00:29:59.032
Mococo!

00:29:59.353 --> 00:29:59.533
Ruffians!

00:30:00.408 --> 00:30:03.812
This here is a wake-up style pup talk!

00:30:05.134 --> 00:30:14.425
Because I need you to remember, I need you to know, that you need to stop thinking that you're not good enough.

00:30:15.927 --> 00:30:16.367
Okay?

00:30:17.629 --> 00:30:18.150
Got it?

00:30:19.311 --> 00:30:23.256
Stop thinking that you're not worthy of the good things in your life, okay?

00:30:24.637 --> 00:30:29.183
Sometimes I hear you, that you talk down to yourself,

00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:39.236
And if you continue to do that, it's gonna make both of us, FUWAMOCO, really, really angry, okay?

00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:40.760
Got it?

00:30:42.164 --> 00:30:42.325
Huh?

00:30:43.328 --> 00:30:43.869
Sure does.

00:30:44.712 --> 00:30:45.113
Yeah.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.229
You're amazing!

00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:51.013
And you're doing your best!

00:30:51.835 --> 00:31:01.600
Of course we all make mistakes sometimes, but you're just on your journey to live life to the best, to the fullest!

00:31:01.698 --> 00:31:09.230
And we'll continue together to search for, you know, what makes you happy, what makes you fulfilled.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:14.719
So let's continue on and remember to be as kind to ourselves as we are to others, okay?

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.502
I believe in you!

00:31:17.123 --> 00:31:18.605
Ganbatte de!

00:31:18.705 --> 00:31:20.989
BAU BAU!

00:31:21.543 --> 00:31:23.806
BAU BAU!

00:31:25.028 --> 00:31:28.072
Thank you Moco-chan for the Pup Talk!

00:31:28.092 --> 00:31:29.334
Wake up Pup Talk!

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:29.654
Got it!

00:31:29.674 --> 00:31:32.097
Here we go!

00:31:32.117 --> 00:31:35.041
BAU BAU!

00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:36.724
Well, it's that time of the day!

00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:45.656
Another fluffy and fuzzy time of the day, not just because FUWAMOCO's here, but because we have our Doggie of the Day!

00:31:45.676 --> 00:31:50.402
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:56.408
Barbie!

00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.490
Barbie!

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:57.890
Barbie!

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.914
You're so funny!

00:32:01.934 --> 00:32:02.955
What the heck!

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:04.357
Hi!

00:32:04.377 --> 00:32:06.079
Cute!

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:07.420
Hi!

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.521
Power stance!

00:32:09.342 --> 00:32:12.486
You're so cool!

00:32:12.566 --> 00:32:14.608
You know, I feel like you know her.

00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:19.393
The longer you look at this beautiful picture of Barbie, the funnier it is.

00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:37.197
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:37.177 --> 00:32:51.608
Ruffians, what do you think of this weird JoJo pose?

00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:54.808
100 push-ups dog, yes!

00:32:54.828 --> 00:32:55.188
Wine.

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:56.430
You would say it's wine.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.032
Have a good.

00:32:59.533 --> 00:33:01.596
It's like a beautiful painting in a museum.

00:33:02.176 --> 00:33:03.918
She's chillin'.

00:33:03.938 --> 00:33:04.679
Chillin' in her own way.

00:33:04.699 --> 00:33:06.121
I don't know if that's chillin'.

00:33:07.282 --> 00:33:08.243
I don't know if that's chillin'.

00:33:09.965 --> 00:33:17.914
Well, you know, maybe give her a few head pats and then, you know, bobby, bobby maybe.

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:18.936
Give her some treats.

00:33:19.256 --> 00:33:21.038
Maybe the jaw lock.

00:33:21.018 --> 00:33:24.747
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:26.972
How does BAU be BAU BAU?

00:33:36.054 --> 00:33:37.778
Cute!

00:33:38.753 --> 00:33:41.276
Do you need some water, Baby?

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:43.219
It's very powerful.

00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:43.519
Powerful?

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.146
I don't know if that's how I describe it, but... It's powerful!

00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:48.927
Get it!

00:33:48.947 --> 00:33:51.170
It'll dry steam!

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.372
Bumpy!

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:55.416
She has attitude, she has aura.

00:33:55.896 --> 00:34:00.302
But most importantly, she also has a heart of gold.

00:34:00.322 --> 00:34:03.807
And she loves to see you smile!

00:34:03.827 --> 00:34:04.508
I know.

00:34:04.488 --> 00:34:06.991
So please continue to smile.

00:34:07.092 --> 00:34:09.415
Walk the dog by her side.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.260
Okay!

00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:14.662
BAU BAU!

00:34:14.682 --> 00:34:14.782
Cute!

00:34:17.045 --> 00:34:22.673
Well, even though you know the song, I might be a little bit suspicious.

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:26.418
Let's see what kind of walks you've been going on, Ruffians!

00:34:26.438 --> 00:34:29.282
And today I went on a walk.

00:34:30.243 --> 00:34:31.845
We have... De-den!

00:34:31.825 --> 00:34:33.288
Hi!

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:34.550
Asakura!

00:34:36.314 --> 00:34:36.514
Beautiful!

00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:37.156
It's a full space party!

00:34:38.518 --> 00:34:44.049
I'm so happy that you're able to go out and enjoy such beautiful cherry blossoms.

00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:45.873
Look how fluffy they are!

00:34:45.893 --> 00:34:46.053
Right!

00:34:46.454 --> 00:34:50.742
And you know, together with us and our eggy plushy form.

00:34:51.183 --> 00:34:51.965
Eggy form!

00:34:53.528 --> 00:34:53.648
Right!

00:34:53.628 --> 00:34:55.331
Hi.

00:34:55.351 --> 00:34:58.858
Well, we hope you're able to sit down and enjoy them.

00:34:58.878 --> 00:34:59.460
We're having something yummy.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.442
Maybe a bit sweet.

00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:11.223
Right, you know if you're like busy, you're like, oh, I just, I gotta go, but I gotta take a moment to look at the sakura, but you know, it's even more nice when you can just kinda sit down and just be like, ah.

00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:11.604
All right.

00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:15.231
So we hope you're able to take a little moment, but

00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:19.698
Well, they're still here in Tokyo for a little while longer.

00:35:19.718 --> 00:35:21.140
Maybe just a little bit.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.502
A really little bit.

00:35:23.423 --> 00:35:25.646
They're almost gone.

00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:28.290
But I'm gonna still wish that they stay around.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.811
Yes.

00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:30.053
Cause I like it.

00:35:30.113 --> 00:35:31.675
It has a ring, this is good.

00:35:31.815 --> 00:35:35.881
So you know, let's enjoy them for as long as we can!

00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.084
I'll enjoy them even when the petals are all on the ground.

00:35:38.165 --> 00:35:41.910
I'll just look at the ground then, but it won't quite be the same.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.092
Why are you so beautiful?

00:35:43.413 --> 00:35:47.039
They were on the tree at one point and then they fell and that was beautiful too.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.143
And now they're on the ground and they're still beautiful.

00:35:49.484 --> 00:35:50.986
Until they kind of get a little bit brown.

00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:53.711
Then maybe it's like, okay, now it's over.

00:35:55.374 --> 00:35:57.578
BAU BAU!

00:35:57.598 --> 00:35:57.799
Thank you!

00:35:57.819 --> 00:36:00.203
Have fun with the fireworks!

00:36:00.503 --> 00:36:05.432
And next we have our Question of the Day.

00:36:05.612 --> 00:36:09.399
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:16.211
I've noticed that Fuwawa sounds like Mococo when she says... No!

00:36:16.431 --> 00:36:17.273
Sometimes.

00:36:17.754 --> 00:36:21.941
Are you doing it on purpose or do you get used to it just now?

00:36:22.803 --> 00:36:25.347
Doing it on purpose, Ruffians?

00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:28.619
Huh?

00:36:29.925 --> 00:36:30.106
Huh?

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:33.501
I don't do anything on purpose, Ruffians!

00:36:35.088 --> 00:36:35.269
Ruffians!

00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:38.205
Do you think we know what we're saying at any moment?

00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:39.126
No.

00:36:39.587 --> 00:36:39.987
No.

00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:42.831
We are not listening to what we say.

00:36:42.851 --> 00:36:43.652
No.

00:36:43.672 --> 00:36:46.695
95% of the times.

00:36:46.715 --> 00:36:46.975
Yeah.

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:49.278
But you know, I don't know.

00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:58.489
I just do, I guess, do the same things as Moco-chan sometimes, you know, because that's how things go when you're twins.

00:36:58.469 --> 00:37:03.124
We're always together you know, so sometimes we do the same things.

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:08.080
And sometimes we don't do the same things because we're individuals too.

00:37:08.582 --> 00:37:09.906
But sometimes it might be similar.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.652
Yeah.

00:37:12.745 --> 00:37:14.149
I had to explain that, huh?

00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:15.372
What did you say?

00:37:16.093 --> 00:37:18.139
I had to explain that, huh?

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:20.304
Thank you for the annunciation.

00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:21.668
I had to explain it again, huh?

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.660
BAU BAU!

00:37:27.342 --> 00:37:27.743
BAU BAU!

00:37:27.763 --> 00:37:28.485
Is that any better?

00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:29.708
I don't know.

00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:33.598
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:39.132
Thank you for all your questions, even if they're extra silly.

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:43.864
Your Pero Sightings, even though maybe it's a way to start the day.

00:37:43.884 --> 00:37:46.009
Maybe not the right way.

00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:48.132
We wanna see your walks!

00:37:48.592 --> 00:37:49.954
We wanna see your doggies!

00:37:50.114 --> 00:37:52.858
Please send them to us with your hashtag.

00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:54.159
With our hashtag!

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.805
Don't use our hashtag.

00:37:59.306 --> 00:38:00.447
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:38:00.687 --> 00:38:02.910
I guess we can share it, Ruffians.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.452
We can share it!

00:38:05.914 --> 00:38:10.900
Don't need to fly over it, okay?

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.649
FUWAMOCO Thank you all of you!

00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:16.811
It's not your hashtag, it's ours!

00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:20.217
Our collective was sharing it all together all the way!

00:38:20.397 --> 00:38:20.597
Push it!

00:38:20.617 --> 00:38:20.718
Okay!

00:38:20.738 --> 00:38:20.938
Push it!

00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:23.643
As long as you send us your doggy as a gift, okay?

00:38:23.663 --> 00:38:23.743
Yes!

00:38:23.763 --> 00:38:24.805
Okay, that's the deal!

00:38:24.825 --> 00:38:26.167
You pushed us!

00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:26.969
Okay!

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.011
It's collective!

00:38:28.492 --> 00:38:29.293
Yes!

00:38:29.847 --> 00:38:32.331
BAU BAU!

00:38:35.156 --> 00:38:47.717
Don't have a schedule out yet this week, but we do have another stream coming up that we have not made our thumbnail yet, so we're gonna be borrowing... De-den!

00:38:48.899 --> 00:38:49.079
Shiori!

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:51.383
That means you know!

00:38:51.363 --> 00:38:56.350
We're both together with Biboo and Shiori!

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:56.470
Yeah!

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:56.891
I'm a big crowd!

00:38:56.931 --> 00:38:59.575
But Nerissa can't join us.

00:38:59.595 --> 00:39:01.578
She's working hard, you know.

00:39:01.658 --> 00:39:02.439
That's okay.

00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:05.223
She wanted to be there.

00:39:05.523 --> 00:39:08.427
But she's working hard and we're not gonna distract her.

00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:14.416
But we're really looking forward to her joining us again soon.

00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:14.936
I'm scared.

00:39:14.956 --> 00:39:16.579
It's not a scary game.

00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:18.241
I don't know what this game is at all.

00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:20.164
I'm expecting... It's a fun game.

00:39:20.184 --> 00:39:20.965
Content warning.

00:39:20.945 --> 00:39:22.248
It's a fun game, right?

00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:24.494
Where, like, little bugs and they're, like, silly?

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:25.697
Right?

00:39:25.717 --> 00:39:26.700
Horns out warning?

00:39:27.482 --> 00:39:27.602
Right?

00:39:27.622 --> 00:39:28.585
Well, you two play!

00:39:28.986 --> 00:39:29.828
I'm planning to play.

00:39:29.848 --> 00:39:31.793
Moco-chan, you're planning to play on your own.

00:39:32.053 --> 00:39:37.167
Oh, I didn't discuss it with you, but I was hoping to.

00:39:37.187 --> 00:39:37.367
Ah, okie.

00:39:37.347 --> 00:39:43.012
It's very silly, that's what I heard, so I'm looking forward to it.

00:39:43.252 --> 00:39:50.219
I hope that you'll join Biboo and Shiori on our silly attempt at this game we've born.

00:39:53.441 --> 00:40:03.571
And just like we mentioned last time, Ruffians, we'll continue to let you know when our next streams are coming up as soon as we can, so please look forward to them.

00:40:03.651 --> 00:40:07.354
It's just a little bit of a funny week this week.

00:40:07.334 --> 00:40:09.617
