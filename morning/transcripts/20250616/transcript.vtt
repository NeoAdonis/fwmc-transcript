00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:25.663
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:29.627
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:33.251
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:36.554
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:36.614 --> 00:05:37.315
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:45.250
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:54.867
Thank you for joining us today for our 164th episode!

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:55.388

00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:56.650

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.495
Thank you!

00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:03.179
Are you awake?

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.841
Oh, your eyes open!

00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:07.365
You can see us?

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:08.386
We don't look bluey!

00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:10.068
I'm fuzzier than normal.

00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:15.296
Why is it?

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:16.397
By the way!

00:06:16.377 --> 00:06:18.159
Big, big claps.

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.499
Claps?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.101
Big claps for you!

00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:21.402
Pachi pachi!

00:06:23.144 --> 00:06:33.254
Well, for the Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:33.274 --> 00:06:34.215
A.K.A.

00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:34.515
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:38.059
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.259
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.140
But right now!

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.500
But!

00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:40.862
Right now!

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:46.047
FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:59.396
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:04.187
Now you know the drill, right Ruffians?

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:06.780
Please send your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:11.766

Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.196
BAU BAU!

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:22.719
BAU BAU!

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:23.480
What is the word?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.122
No, no, no.

00:07:25.582 --> 00:07:27.745
FUWAMOCO is adorable and cool!

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:30.908
That's good because you know it's getting hotter with the summer.

00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:35.673
When we continue, FUWAMOCO Morning back to three times a week, you don't want Mondays anymore.

00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:37.094

Huh?

00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:50.588
Huh?

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:50.708
Huh?

00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:50.808
Huh?

00:07:50.828 --> 00:07:50.908
Huh?

00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:51.088
Huh?

00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:51.208
Huh?

00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:51.329
Huh?

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:51.429
Huh?

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:51.529
Huh?

00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:51.629
Huh?

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:51.729
Huh?

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.829

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:52.770
Huh?

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:59.221
Let's start it off on the right paw, okay, Ruffians?

00:07:59.241 --> 00:07:59.401
BAU BAU!

00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:03.108
I feel like it's been such a long time since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:07.236
What comes up next, Moco-chan?

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:13.268
There's been a lot of exciting news happening, right?

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:15.552
Should we just get right to that?

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:17.678
No.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:21.122
Moco-chan, why are you stopping like that?

00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:28.210
I would like to say, you know, what I... Huh?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.592
You know, you know, huh?

00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:30.353
You know what?

00:08:30.373 --> 00:08:31.474
You know what, Moco-chan?

00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:40.165
There's been another Pero sighting!

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:41.046
OPA!

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:45.471
Well, we won't know until we see, huh?

00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:50.766
What kind of nastiness has been getting up to that FUWAMOCO-chan?

00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:55.714
Let's take a look, civil villains.

00:09:00.402 --> 00:09:00.743
De-den!

00:09:01.938 --> 00:09:05.624
This Pero sighting kind of warms my heart.

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:09.511
It's not nasty, huh?

00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:10.753
Not nasty!

00:09:11.194 --> 00:09:13.177
I don't know, he looks so free.

00:09:13.217 --> 00:09:20.149
I don't know, usually solar eclipses, they're not like that.

00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:37.902
Pero is tired.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.735
Incandescent nastiness.

00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:43.298
What?

00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:45.982
Ruffians!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:50.309
I mean, you say it's solar eclipse, but we thought that he's not bothering anyone.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.411
Right, you know.

00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.316
Besides, it looks like it's reaching all the planets today.

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:56.480
Yeah, he's even wearing some wreaths.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.101
You know!

00:09:57.261 --> 00:09:59.905
It looks like, you know, nothing bad happened to you.

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:00.587
You're all positive.

00:10:00.627 --> 00:10:01.508
This Ruffian's positive.

00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:03.872
More than a reason to wear sunscreen.

00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:05.617
True, true.

00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:07.980
There's always a reason to wear sunscreen.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.903
Even when it's cloudy outside, you need to wear sunscreen.

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:11.965
Yes, wear it.

00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:13.146
Yeah.

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:20.995
But... Calling Pero handsome... I think that's going too far.

00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:22.177
Yeah.

00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:24.079
Too far, Ruffians.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:25.701
Yeah.

00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:26.962
Just say, oh!

00:10:26.982 --> 00:10:28.884
I feel... Bright!

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:29.085
Wow.

00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:29.485
Yes.

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:31.187
Sunny!

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:34.311
Yes.

00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:34.551
Handsome.

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:41.331
BAU BAU!

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:43.093
You blocked the sun rays!

00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:45.176
You know what blocks the sun rays even better?

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:46.077
Sunscreen!

00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:47.338
Yep!

00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:53.466
That's what I was gonna say!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:53.946
BAU BAU!

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:54.407
Ruffians!

00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:58.332
We have a bunch of news that we want to share with you!

00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:03.458
You know maybe it's been just as busy as a week as FUWAMOCO is!

00:11:03.438 --> 00:11:07.503
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:07.523 --> 00:11:18.376
We had a big dream come true!

00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:20.959
We just released a brand new song!

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:29.209
And it's actually the ending theme to a video game visual novel called Nekupara!

00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:31.352
BAU BAU!

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:37.358
It's the newest, the newest Nekopara game in the series and also the final one.

00:11:37.518 --> 00:11:39.941
Nekopara After the Rain for me.

00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:46.167
It just came out and FUWAMOCO will be singing the ending theme!

00:11:46.627 --> 00:11:49.230
The song is called "side by side"!

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:52.353
And it's written by Aiobahn, THE Aiobahn!

00:11:52.373 --> 00:11:53.134
Aiobahn-san.

00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:02.464
Overdose.

00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:04.607
Internet yamero.

00:12:05.088 --> 00:12:07.110
Amazing talented creator.

00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:12.918
And we got to sing Aiobahn-san's song!

00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:13.799
BAU BAU!

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:15.442
Yes, it is the ending theme for the game.

00:12:16.623 --> 00:12:20.989
If you haven't tried Nekopara before, you can check it out at Volume 1.

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:23.152
It's on Steam, it's on Switch.

00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:26.837
Go check out Nekopara After!

00:12:27.323 --> 00:12:27.764
De-den!

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:29.387
De-den!

00:12:29.407 --> 00:12:32.173
We also played it all together, Ruffians!

00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:34.799
From the start until the very end.

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:36.623
We volume one!

00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:39.629
It got a little bit crazy.

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:43.257
A bit.

00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:47.875
Ruffians, don't get any weird ideas, okay?

00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:48.075
Ruffians!

00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:49.877
But we're really happy.

00:12:49.897 --> 00:12:53.300
In FUWAMOCO, we really love visual novels.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.964
And we know Nekopara's been a series that we're big fans of.

00:12:58.384 --> 00:13:01.267
Even though we're demon dogs, so please don't get confused.

00:13:01.327 --> 00:13:06.031
But they let these demon dogs in to be able to sing one last song.

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:07.753
So we're really, really happy.

00:13:08.273 --> 00:13:12.197
And just being able to spread our love for visual novels.

00:13:12.177 --> 00:13:36.615
Moco-chan, you're kinda by my side there, huh?

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:44.871
This is also by my side, Ruffians!

00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:46.134
We came up with the title!

00:13:46.415 --> 00:13:50.183
We also did the spoken lines ourselves too, we wrote them ourselves.

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:51.747
On the spot!

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.937
But the song, you know, it's a very personal song that

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:59.662
It's a bit of our journey, as well as Shoko and Vanilla!

00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:06.132
It's a very very special song, and we feel so honored to be able to sing it!

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:07.954
Yeah, please check it out!

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:09.517
It is on AyoBan's channel!

00:14:09.537 --> 00:14:12.421
There's a very amazing MV animated!

00:14:12.441 --> 00:14:17.228
Very nostalgic MV there, so please please go take a look at it there too!

00:14:17.248 --> 00:14:20.012
It's a perfect song to spend summer with your family!

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:23.477
You know, there's the MV version, but actually...

00:14:23.457 --> 00:14:33.105
The song is a little bit of an MV edit, so if you want to be able to hear what it sounds like in the full version, you can go check it out on streaming services as well!

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:36.428
Thank you, Mofu!

00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:38.790
We hope you make a good theme to this one, Luis!

00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:44.094
BAU BAU!

00:14:44.595 --> 00:14:50.140
I hope we can be able to do more stuff together with the Visual Novels and share our passion for them!

00:14:52.482 --> 00:14:53.042
BAU BAU!

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:58.850
As for other fun things this past week, it's been a bit busy.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.032
It's been a busy week!

00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:02.034
Botan-senpai!

00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:07.581
She organized a very special event with a bunch of hololive members!

00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:12.607
The hololive Minecraft Gold Rush Survival Event!

00:15:12.627 --> 00:15:15.491
FUWAMOCO, we participated in it!

00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:18.836
But for a good portion of it, I think we only did one day.

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:21.279
Only one day, but it was an event with Minecraft!

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.320
We have to make the

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.208
And we have different job classes that we could pick.

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:29.852
FUWAMOCO, we have mainly the adventure.

00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:32.616
Moco-chan, you kind of do the minor for a bit.

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:36.341
Adventure, miner, craftsman, farmer.

00:15:36.982 --> 00:15:39.006
There's lots of different things to do.

00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:44.254
A lot of different games and events going on every single day.

00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:46.136
Bosses, ghouls.

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:48.460
But,

00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:51.541
Wow, the results are in!

00:15:51.822 --> 00:16:01.944
And the winner who made the most money is Pekora-senpai!

00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:02.526
BAU BAU!

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:03.107
Moco-chan?

00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:06.880
Is it that surprising?

00:16:07.922 --> 00:16:09.783
Is that that surprising?

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:13.307
No!

00:16:13.327 --> 00:16:13.487
BAU BAU!

00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:13.848
BAU BAU!

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.290
Congratulations, Pekora-senpai!

00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:20.815
Oh, I definitely didn't kill you right away after I was announced, though.

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:21.456
I didn't do it on purpose!

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:24.939
I'm sure I was more shocked about it than Pekora-senpai was.

00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:26.781
You sure?

00:16:27.001 --> 00:16:28.723
I sure, boy, sure!

00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:29.023
Nice shot.

00:16:29.043 --> 00:16:29.984
I'm so bounded.

00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:31.626
Why did it work that time?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:46.461
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.586
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:58.120
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:58.488 --> 00:17:02.415
We got 11!

00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:04.860
That's pretty good, right?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.280
Yeah!

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.823
Wait, how many players were there?

00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:09.929
Oh, now we have both done!

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:10.630
I'm not too sure.

00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:14.016
But 11, that's pretty good, right?

00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:14.197
Yeah!

00:17:14.217 --> 00:17:14.978
11 out of...

00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:30.992
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:40.484
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:53.503
Have a howl of a day!

00:17:54.007 --> 00:18:00.316
I was a very very good adventurer.

00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.878
That's what this picture says.

00:18:01.978 --> 00:18:03.720
It says honest adventurer.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:09.648
Moco-chan, where are you there, huh?

00:18:12.652 --> 00:18:14.995
I'm the second best adventurer!

00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:15.656
I'm fourth again!

00:18:15.696 --> 00:18:16.838
Here I'm fourth!

00:18:16.858 --> 00:18:17.078
Yes!

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.360
Yes!

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:21.882
Yeah!

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:22.563
So I got the adventure!

00:18:22.583 --> 00:18:25.106
Adventure who made the most money!

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:25.226
Yeah!

00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:26.088
And we had lots of fun!

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:28.811
We know playing together with our senpai through all the mini-games.

00:18:29.312 --> 00:18:31.675
We had, what's it, the snakes and ladders?

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:36.101
Yeah, those were real good!

00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:37.023
Yeah, together with Watame-senpai and Ririka!

00:18:37.463 --> 00:18:38.164
That was fun.

00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:38.985
Lots of fun!

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:44.533
But there's also another category that Moco-chan... You ranked in on.

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:53.867
Moco-chan got number 3 on the most gambling losses.

00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:56.498
Forget that part.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.172
It didn't happen!

00:18:58.633 --> 00:19:03.904
And that's before we just kept on gambling away our money at the very end there!

00:19:04.546 --> 00:19:05.387
It was broken!

00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:08.173
It was a bug, I guarantee you!

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.561
We didn't even gamble that much, Moco-chan.

00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:17.473
I asked Mocai-senpai, but even before I sent her my question, she was like, don't worry about it, game's over.

00:19:18.297 --> 00:19:19.839
Hi!

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:27.008
I wanted to win!

00:19:27.028 --> 00:19:30.332
But we had a bunch of fun playing together with our senpai!

00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:31.733
Thank you Ruffians for helping us with Minecraft!

00:19:32.074 --> 00:19:39.743
We're still learning lots, but we want to be able to play more soon!

00:19:39.964 --> 00:19:40.524
BAU BAU!

00:19:41.245 --> 00:19:41.445
Thank you!

00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:44.008
Thank you to both our senpais for organizing it all!

00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:45.410
And all the staff for some too!

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.713
Thank you!

00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:54.187
I feel like there's been a lot of announcements recently.

00:19:54.207 --> 00:19:57.214
Maybe it's been difficult to keep track of them?

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:03.087
I feel like maybe you missed one or two or three or more things, Ruffians.

00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:06.715
It's been a flurry of news and a busy week.

00:20:06.695 --> 00:20:17.638
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:22.729
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:38.980
Moco-chan, you gotta eat!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.443
I'm gonna eat it.

00:20:40.463 --> 00:20:42.907
I'm gonna eat the shrimp sushi.

00:20:42.927 --> 00:20:46.433
Everybody else is not for you!

00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:46.994
I'm gonna eat it!

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:50.099
And you know, I'm extra fluffy!

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:52.222
Nerissa there with her big pirate hat.

00:20:52.603 --> 00:20:54.987
Why does she get the biggest one, huh?

00:20:55.268 --> 00:20:56.950
Mine is pretty good though, too.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.253
Yours is the tiniest one.

00:20:58.273 --> 00:21:00.276
No it's not, it's the tiniest.

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.901
What does that say, huh?

00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:03.882
It says nothing!

00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:06.567
BAU BAU!

00:21:06.587 --> 00:21:06.667
But!

00:21:06.988 --> 00:21:08.631
It's not just a collab!

00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:10.074
No!

00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:21.815
There's also merchandise and there's gonna be special themed stores, decorations, exclusive merchandise, and a themed menu item!

00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:22.095
Right!

00:21:22.075 --> 00:21:24.680
I heard that the store is really amazing!

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:28.447
It's gonna be on from June 16th to now!

00:21:29.008 --> 00:21:31.472
Until August 10th!

00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:34.117
So we hope that you can head over there and enjoy some sushi!

00:21:34.217 --> 00:21:38.585
And then maybe get your paws on some very exclusive merchandise as well!

00:21:39.908 --> 00:21:44.556
There's also gonna be exclusive gifts with purchases too!

00:21:44.536 --> 00:22:01.633
Yo ho ahoy yo.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:04.016
And you saw the keychains!

00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:05.918
Yo, ahoy yo.

00:22:06.278 --> 00:22:10.082
Let's go to Sushi Road!

00:22:10.102 --> 00:22:11.323
Beautiful Moco-chan!

00:22:11.384 --> 00:22:13.246
Nice song!

00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:18.231
Definitely buy the BAU BAU!

00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:18.892
I'm so excited!

00:22:18.912 --> 00:22:21.494
Please send us lots and lots of photos, okay?

00:22:22.536 --> 00:22:22.876
Ruffians!

00:22:22.896 --> 00:22:24.438
Please use the hashtag!

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:30.304
Hashtag F-U-W-A-M-O-C-O!

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:31.707
What hashtag is that?

00:22:32.729 --> 00:22:33.049
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:34.933 --> 00:22:36.837
I feel like it was really easy to say it.

00:22:36.917 --> 00:22:38.099
Hashtag FUWAMOCO.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.325
Done!

00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:41.666
BAU BAU!

00:22:41.686 --> 00:22:43.730
Wait, did she miss an O?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.832
Did I?

00:22:44.852 --> 00:22:48.539
BAU BAU!

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.521
BAU BAU!

00:22:49.882 --> 00:22:53.208
Use the right hashtag, okay?

00:22:53.228 --> 00:22:53.288
On!

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:54.851
We're super excited!

00:22:55.732 --> 00:22:59.599
We hope you have a bunch of fun and have a very full tummy afterwards too.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.245
BAU BAU!

00:23:03.605 --> 00:23:05.168
But that's not it for announcements.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.736
What do you mean more announcements?

00:23:09.756 --> 00:23:11.479
I don't know, I'm already excited enough.

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:13.322
I can't take much more, Moco-chan.

00:23:13.342 --> 00:23:16.407
Well make sure you hold on to your hearts, okay?

00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:30.090
Just yesterday, there was a special 3D program that happened on the official hololive English channel.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.573
Did you see it Moco-chan?

00:23:31.593 --> 00:23:33.195
FUWAMOCO, we are there together.

00:23:33.215 --> 00:23:35.439
Calli-senpai and G.G.

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:37.703
Ancestor.

00:23:38.915 --> 00:23:39.976
Did you see it?

00:23:39.996 --> 00:23:41.719
It's a big news.

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:41.839
But!

00:23:42.239 --> 00:23:43.661
Well, it was a really silly time.

00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:44.703
But the news!

00:23:45.043 --> 00:23:46.065
News!

00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:47.466
It's what you want to know, right?

00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:49.830
It was announced there!

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:58.802
hololive English, we're gonna be having a news day concert!

00:23:58.822 --> 00:23:59.002
A FUWAMO!

00:23:59.022 --> 00:23:59.202
A FUWAMO!

00:23:59.222 --> 00:23:59.843
We're gonna be having a FUWAMO!

00:23:59.823 --> 00:24:08.202
It's gonna be happening in New York City!

00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:11.390
A radio city music hall!

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.452
The famous venue!

00:24:12.532 --> 00:24:15.840
Not just one day of Ruffians, two days!

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:22.709
It's gonna be happening August 23rd and August 24th.

00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:25.213
We're so excited!

00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:25.753
It's huge!

00:24:25.773 --> 00:24:34.104
And we're gonna be there together with you Ruffians!

00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:34.605
All of hololive English!

00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:52.594
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:25:11.342
BAU BAU!

00:25:11.322 --> 00:25:13.726
Thank you!

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.410
Yeah, it's fun, super fun.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:23.039
And you know, I recommend even if you are there in person to check out the streaming tickets as well because it's totally different.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.742
You get to see really close.

00:25:24.762 --> 00:25:25.643
Close up!

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:30.971
So I feel like, you know, both in person and streaming tickets are totally different.

00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:32.674
Both very, very great experiences.

00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:39.304
But we're really excited being able to hear your big BAU BAUs all together with us!

00:25:39.324 --> 00:25:40.165
We're excited to hear it!

00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:43.649
It's been more than once a year, right?

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:45.891
Once a year is already amazing, but more!

00:25:46.992 --> 00:25:49.735
The experience is different, you know?

00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:51.477
It can be new to me.

00:25:51.497 --> 00:25:53.179
All the other Ruffians did too!

00:25:53.199 --> 00:25:54.961
And you know that we really love concerts.

00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:57.143
Live experiences, live concerts.

00:25:57.163 --> 00:26:02.649
So this year, I have a goal.

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:07.114
If we're so lucky that we get to do another MC.

00:26:07.972 --> 00:26:10.416
I would like to hold back on the thank yous.

00:26:10.436 --> 00:26:14.742
I'll not say thank you.

00:26:14.942 --> 00:26:16.485
Like, 80% less.

00:26:16.505 --> 00:26:16.745
80%?

00:26:16.765 --> 00:26:19.049
We only say thank you at the very end, Moco-chan.

00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:20.551
Like, maybe we say it five times.

00:26:21.272 --> 00:26:21.693
Why?

00:26:21.853 --> 00:26:22.294
Why?

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:26.280
Because FUWAMOCO, you just end up only saying thank you!

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.241
Thank you!

00:26:27.541 --> 00:26:30.165
Not once last year did I see you for Breaking Dimensions.

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:31.888
Thank you!

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.375
Thank you!

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:36.595
It's cute!

00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:41.003
BAU BAU!

00:26:41.023 --> 00:26:42.465
Why are you so thankful?

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:45.130
I'm just so thankful and happy and I love you!

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.035
But we're really really excited to be able to be there!

00:26:48.055 --> 00:26:51.421
Not just here, but all of hololive English!

00:26:51.922 --> 00:26:53.385
We're gonna do our best!

00:26:54.326 --> 00:26:56.170
What is something else we're needed?

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.095
All of hololive English.

00:26:59.355 --> 00:27:00.878
All of them.

00:27:02.022 --> 00:27:03.665
Wow!

00:27:04.847 --> 00:27:05.267
Justice!

00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:11.598
This is hololive English -Justice-!

00:27:11.618 --> 00:27:13.080
They also announced the 3D debut!

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.300
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.621
Look!

00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:13.941
Look!

00:27:14.022 --> 00:27:14.963
It looks good!

00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:15.684
Nostalgic!

00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:15.945
Nostalgic!

00:27:15.965 --> 00:27:16.165
Nostalgic!

00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:16.566
Nostalgic!

00:27:16.586 --> 00:27:16.726
Right!

00:27:16.746 --> 00:27:19.611
Justice is going to be holding the 3D showcases this August!

00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:25.380
And fighting with Elizabeth on August 1st at 5pm!

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.552
Gigi on August 2nd at 5pm PT.

00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:35.123
Cecilia a few days later on August 8th at 5pm PT.

00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:39.312
And now that August 9th at 5pm PT.

00:27:39.453 --> 00:27:40.956
Finally!

00:27:40.936 --> 00:28:01.645
August 23rd, 24th.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.722
All for one.

00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:04.142
Right!

00:28:04.202 --> 00:28:04.542
There!

00:28:04.563 --> 00:28:05.083
Just like that!

00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:06.504
Is it okay?

00:28:07.646 --> 00:28:10.348
Just like that calendar for August is all full!

00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:12.891
Is it okay if we monopolize your August?

00:28:14.072 --> 00:28:17.315
August is ours now.

00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:19.017
Put it in your calendar!

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:21.259
We have it on our calendar!

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.161
Why don't you have it in your calendar?

00:28:23.181 --> 00:28:24.162
Put it in your calendar!

00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:28.287
We're super excited seeing a graphic like this.

00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:29.708
It reminds me...

00:28:29.688 --> 00:28:37.161
AlvinSweetieDebut just about a year ago on August 2!

00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:42.290
AlvinSweetieDebut is on your birthday!

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.272
Amazing birthday gift!

00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:44.534
I can't wait!

00:28:44.554 --> 00:28:51.426
We've been trying to get as much info out of them as possible, but secrets are secrets.

00:28:51.406 --> 00:28:57.112
I'm so just as excited as you are right now!

00:28:57.132 --> 00:28:57.933
I'll be just as beautiful today!

00:28:58.754 --> 00:28:59.675
That's how I feel.

00:29:00.096 --> 00:29:03.760
I feel like it was just the other day we were watching Justice Debut.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.127
I saw today one Ruffian said, I didn't know FUWAMOCO already has 3D bodies.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:19.337
Sorry, it's been a year.

00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.875
It's been a year, you know, maybe there's been a month.

00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:24.317
I've been sleeping for about a year.

00:29:24.337 --> 00:29:25.878
Or maybe they're asleep for a year.

00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:26.539
That's okay.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.740
They're well-rested now.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.983
You know, now they have even more excitement.

00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:33.345
They think justice is gonna be defeated too!

00:29:34.467 --> 00:29:34.967
BAU BAU!

00:29:34.987 --> 00:29:35.948
I would notice that!

00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:39.431
Yeah, like I said, it feels like it was just yesterday that justice debuted.

00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:40.272
But it wasn't!

00:29:40.292 --> 00:29:40.953
It wasn't!

00:29:40.973 --> 00:29:42.995
It was about a year ago!

00:29:45.157 --> 00:29:45.938
They're having their first anniversary!

00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:46.118
BAU BAU!

00:29:46.098 --> 00:29:50.830
Justice is having their first anniversary!

00:29:51.051 --> 00:29:52.013
Can you believe that?

00:29:52.475 --> 00:29:53.277
Right!

00:29:53.297 --> 00:29:55.222
For sure!

00:29:55.242 --> 00:29:55.703
Right!

00:29:56.678 --> 00:29:57.780
That was fast.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.501
That was fast.

00:29:58.521 --> 00:30:00.044
That was fast.

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:00.405
Right!

00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:01.106
Oh my gosh!

00:30:01.246 --> 00:30:02.188
Oh my gosh!

00:30:02.428 --> 00:30:03.430
A whole year is gone!

00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:05.113
It grew up so fast!

00:30:05.273 --> 00:30:06.576
I know, right?

00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:06.856
You do!

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:09.220
I call her!

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.841
But!

00:30:09.861 --> 00:30:15.011
There's going to be a very special first anniversary stream on Yaeji's channel!

00:30:15.031 --> 00:30:20.340
It's going to be happening on June 20th at 3pm PT!

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.644
And that's all we know of what's gonna happen.

00:30:22.664 --> 00:30:24.687
It's gonna be Operation Decode.

00:30:24.707 --> 00:30:29.094
I still remember the very first group stream after they all debuted the collab.

00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:30.797
That was something else.

00:30:31.638 --> 00:30:31.818
Yeah.

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:33.281
Now it's been a year.

00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:34.402
Now it's been a year.

00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:37.427
I'm worried.

00:30:37.447 --> 00:30:37.848
Why are you worried?

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:40.132
Is it gonna get a little bit too crazy?

00:30:40.152 --> 00:30:42.095
Oh, too chaotic?

00:30:43.096 --> 00:30:43.257
Chaotic?

00:30:43.597 --> 00:30:44.238
Oh.

00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:44.478
Oh.

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:45.680
Operation Getting Advent.

00:30:47.103 --> 00:30:47.323
No.

00:30:48.383 --> 00:30:52.789
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:31:11.877
Have a howl of a day!

00:31:14.641 --> 00:31:15.683
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:15.703 --> 00:31:16.404
Another debut.

00:31:16.424 --> 00:31:17.946
I'm here and everything.

00:31:17.966 --> 00:31:18.948
Yes!

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:21.612
BAU BAU!

00:31:22.073 --> 00:31:22.514
BAU BAU!

00:31:22.534 --> 00:31:26.139
I'm so happy for your justice.

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:26.320
BAU BAU!

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.221
BAU BAU!

00:31:27.241 --> 00:31:29.865
Moco-chan, I feel like a proud senpai right now.

00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:30.206
Yeah.

00:31:31.127 --> 00:31:32.489
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.715
Yeah, only a few more days until our first FWC.

00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:37.558
Exciting.

00:31:37.578 --> 00:31:38.158
It's soon.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.003
Time goes by fast.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.524
Where does it go?

00:31:43.544 --> 00:31:46.949
So many exciting things going on, so make sure you put them in your calendars, okay?

00:31:46.969 --> 00:31:50.555
Yes, don't forget, don't forget!

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.660
Yeah, it's going to be so epic!

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.141
BAU BAU!

00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:54.461
BAU BAU!

00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:59.650
If you're not already, you know, awake and going and excited for the week.

00:32:01.032 --> 00:32:01.573
Moco-chan.

00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:04.670
Do you have something maybe?

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.598
Give us just a little bit of a... Don't give a damn!

00:32:08.618 --> 00:32:09.119
Don't give a damn!

00:32:09.139 --> 00:32:15.812
I think it's gonna be very, very, very, very cute and doggy, but... Hi.

00:32:15.832 --> 00:32:16.734
Mococo seem wise.

00:32:17.175 --> 00:32:18.417
You're being dramatic!

00:32:21.383 --> 00:32:21.464
Hi!

00:32:21.484 --> 00:32:25.772
Maybe Moco-chan you could give us a bit of a... Hi.

00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:28.475
Wow.

00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.619
Can I do a bit of a cry in our Pup Talk today?

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:35.022
A little bit more fuzzy.

00:32:35.042 --> 00:32:35.102
Ah.

00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:36.063
Fuzzier.

00:32:38.525 --> 00:32:43.370
Yeah.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:43.550
Okay.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:43.730
BAU BAU!

00:32:45.872 --> 00:32:46.052
Ruffians!

00:32:47.093 --> 00:32:48.595
It's that time again!

00:32:49.476 --> 00:32:52.559
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:32:53.339 --> 00:32:56.843
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:32:57.003 --> 00:32:57.143
Mococo!

00:32:58.152 --> 00:32:58.873
Ruffians!

00:32:59.894 --> 00:33:02.096
Have you been kinder so recently?

00:33:03.257 --> 00:33:10.484
You know, I'm not just talking about a party, or going on a vacation, or you know, anything grandiose like that.

00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:15.329
I'm just talking on a daily basis.

00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:16.590
Are you drinking water?

00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:18.052
Not coffee.

00:33:19.413 --> 00:33:20.314
Not soda!

00:33:21.415 --> 00:33:21.755
Water.

00:33:23.177 --> 00:33:24.598
Are you eating properly?

00:33:25.299 --> 00:33:25.959
Nutrition!

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.501
Vitamins!

00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:30.555
Are you sleeping?

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:31.497
A full night's sleep?

00:33:36.346 --> 00:33:36.686
Properly.

00:33:37.247 --> 00:33:38.389
No nap.

00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:40.854
Yeah?

00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:45.763
No, you need to drink water, not just soda, okay?

00:33:47.366 --> 00:33:47.987
A full night's sleep.

00:33:49.351 --> 00:33:56.999
You know, you can't expect yourself to continue going at full steam ahead unless you make sure that you're taking care of your basic needs, okay?

00:33:58.561 --> 00:34:04.447
You can't be angry at yourself for not being enough when you weren't even fair enough to yourself to begin with, you know?

00:34:05.688 --> 00:34:11.254
So, make sure to take care of yourself because you're the number one person who can be kind to you.

00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:12.195
Got it?

00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:13.556
You're being called out?

00:34:13.576 --> 00:34:14.357
You're being called out.

00:34:14.457 --> 00:34:15.298
Got it, yeah?

00:34:16.299 --> 00:34:17.881
How long is a full night?

00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:19.122
5 to 8 hours.

00:34:20.502 --> 00:34:22.946
We're going for fair.

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:24.990

00:34:26.453 --> 00:34:28.697

We're being fair.

00:34:37.733 --> 00:34:38.615
Not perfection.

00:34:39.697 --> 00:34:40.939
At least seven.

00:35:26.828 --> 00:35:27.049
Wake up!

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:29.034
We can let Gambler sleep.

00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:32.222
Cause it's cute.

00:35:32.242 --> 00:35:35.330
I love the pink and blue color, they're cute!

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.576

00:35:38.217 --> 00:35:40.864

And next we have the day I went on a walk with you!

00:36:34.628 --> 00:36:37.031
Where were you around this time, Ruffians?

00:36:38.412 --> 00:36:38.532
There!

00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:40.214
Is it a walk?

00:36:40.294 --> 00:36:40.615
Huh?

00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:40.975
Huh?

00:36:40.995 --> 00:36:45.800
Is it a walk?

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.241
This is your walkout!

00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:47.702
This is not fair!

00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:49.184
This is the best walk ever!

00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:54.810
But you get to bring a delicious meal with you home!

00:36:55.533 --> 00:36:57.836
Hi!

00:36:57.856 --> 00:36:59.899
I don't know Moco-chan, I have a feeling though.

00:36:59.919 --> 00:37:03.724
I have a feeling that this cat probably works at that place.

00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:07.129
No, they work with me now.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:07.990
Hired!

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:08.410
Hired!

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.971
Yeah.

00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:10.053
Yes, promoted!

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:13.978
Now, the boy!

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:15.740
It's so cute!

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.902
Moco-chan, look!

00:37:16.922 --> 00:37:18.704
Look at how cute it is!

00:37:18.724 --> 00:37:19.245
It's so cute!

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:25.413
I just, I want to be able to head directly there to this door!

00:37:25.653 --> 00:37:27.859
To be able to smell the tommy!

00:37:27.899 --> 00:37:29.262
That's the paws!

00:37:29.282 --> 00:37:30.064
Look at the paws!

00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:33.031
No, no, no, no, they're too thick.

00:37:34.013 --> 00:37:35.156
Kiss the nose.

00:37:35.176 --> 00:37:37.842
No, the tail, the tail, the feet.

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:46.360
I feel like this is a very good motivator to get going outside, huh?

00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:50.208
Yes, cats are a good motivator for outside visits, yes!

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:55.780
But I'm glad that you also enjoyed the night market!

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:02.432
But as for a little head pat, I think you can do better than that.

00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:05.036
We'll give him a lot more than that!

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:11.227
Kisses!

00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:11.668
Get ready for kisses!

00:38:11.688 --> 00:38:11.788
Mofo!

00:38:12.169 --> 00:38:14.393
Look at the stripes, Moco-chan!

00:38:14.413 --> 00:38:16.857
It's literally coffee bean color.

00:38:17.174 --> 00:38:33.215
Next we have eye Question of the Day!

00:38:33.616 --> 00:38:36.820
Today's Question of the Day is...

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.324
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:38:40.344 --> 00:38:46.491
I wanted to take this time to share my love for tabletop games, like all the different versions of Mahjong.

00:38:46.952 --> 00:38:48.233
Do you like tabletop games?

00:38:48.353 --> 00:38:50.936
And if you do, which one is your favorite?

00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:58.585
I think we like tabletop games!

00:38:58.865 --> 00:39:02.149
Fun things are fun!

00:39:02.129 --> 00:39:04.793
We can't really say that we play them that often.

00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:10.801
We haven't played really any tabletop games together with the Ruffians either.

00:39:10.821 --> 00:39:18.030
We want to learn my job!

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.431
We have a FUWAMOCO!

00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:18.811
Right!

00:39:18.891 --> 00:39:23.117
They're gonna teach us my job!

00:39:23.137 --> 00:39:23.257
Right!

00:39:23.598 --> 00:39:26.442
But, uh, we also, you know, I think this counts.

00:39:26.702 --> 00:39:27.984
We like Jenga.

00:39:28.084 --> 00:39:29.946
Does Jenga count as a tabletop game?

00:39:29.966 --> 00:39:30.828
I think it counts.

00:39:30.948 --> 00:39:31.208
Jenga counts.

00:39:31.188 --> 00:39:33.753
Tabletop game.

00:39:35.557 --> 00:39:36.118
Jenga.

00:39:36.339 --> 00:39:37.080
Kind of.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.381
It does!

00:39:38.102 --> 00:39:40.687
I like Jenga!

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.074
Not Ouija boards.

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:44.856
No.

00:39:45.718 --> 00:39:46.800
Don't touch them.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.904
FUWAMOCO!

00:39:50.944 --> 00:40:04.277

00:40:16.328 --> 00:40:17.089
Huh?

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.232
Tabletop?

00:40:18.252 --> 00:40:19.614
Put it on the table, Moco-chan.

00:40:19.715 --> 00:40:20.656
Tabletop, right?

00:40:21.598 --> 00:40:25.145
I think we have a bunch of cards to open too.

00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:29.153
I don't think a bunch counts.

00:40:29.173 --> 00:40:31.317
I think it's like a bajillion.

00:40:32.714 --> 00:40:37.545
