00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.893
Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.881
I'm not a chihuahua!

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.885
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.027
Do we want to try this again?

00:05:21.047 --> 00:05:22.229
I thought we were muted.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.012
I thought so too, that was so weird.

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.256
Why did we both think that?

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:26.856
I don't know.

00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:28.619
Were we muted?

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.925
Let's try again.

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:32.886
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:34.108
Okay, we're hiding, we're hiding, we're hiding.

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.988
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.278
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:58.075 --> 00:05:59.879
Moco-chan!

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:02.425
I have to sneeze!

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:05.496
Let's go on.

00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:08.822
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:06:08.842 --> 00:06:12.568
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:06:12.628 --> 00:06:15.593
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.613 --> 00:06:17.115
BAU BAU!

00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:20.481
And today we're apparently sneezing.

00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:23.285
I'm the jam host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:24.267
BAU BAU!

00:06:24.287 --> 00:06:29.615
Thank you for joining us for our 173rd episode today!

00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:30.657
BAU BAU!

00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:40.468
Do you sneeze that often, FUWAMOCO Morning, in the first place?

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.430
I think it's pretty rare nowadays.

00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:45.794
Well, we'll see.

00:06:46.354 --> 00:06:46.434
But!

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:54.163
For those who are joining us today for the very first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:58.371
It's every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:01.638
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.910
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:10.556
Yeah, because Mondays is a pretty nice day.

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:11.798
Yeah, is it?

00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:14.283
And that way we can get more balance.

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:14.663
Yeah!

00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:19.633
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:25.143
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:29.671
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.757
BAU BAU!

00:07:32.737 --> 00:07:35.120
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:37.624
Thank you for the hashtag hashtag!

00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:40.468
Let's do it, Moco-chan!

00:07:40.488 --> 00:07:42.752
Let's start the day on the right paw!

00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:44.013
Only the day, not the week.

00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:44.915
And the week!

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:47.298
All the days, not the month.

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.944
Let's do our best, okay?

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:54.949
It was a fun weekend, right, Moco-chan?

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.612
Yeah!

00:07:56.732 --> 00:07:57.713
There should be no bugs.

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:01.579
It's a Monday, but it's a new week, only possible.

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:03.026
Um.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:05.688
What?

00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:07.730
Wow.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.691
What?

00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:09.232
What?

00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:09.832
Moco-chan.

00:08:09.852 --> 00:08:13.996
I think it's been a Pero Sighting.

00:08:14.817 --> 00:08:15.918
Pero Sighting.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.141
Does it have to be at the beginning of every week?

00:08:20.242 --> 00:08:22.884
It's important information, it goes at the beginning right!

00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:25.166
Just like a band-aid.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:26.308
Should it go at the end?

00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:26.988
I don't know.

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:27.208
Okay.

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:30.231
Where was Pero sighted now then?

00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:31.132
Let's take a look.

00:08:32.073 --> 00:08:32.173
Yeah.

00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:34.905
De-den!

00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:36.972
Where?

00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:38.879
MisDo!

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:43.817
Get away from those pon-de-rings, Pero!

00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:45.876
He ate one!

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:46.477
What?

00:08:47.218 --> 00:08:47.499
What?

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:51.264
I mean, I guess if it was a free one, then it's okay!

00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:52.506
Maybe.

00:08:52.847 --> 00:08:53.127
Yeah?

00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:57.914
If it's free, then it's pretty much just like he's eating garbage, right?

00:08:57.934 --> 00:09:01.259
No, the same one out of the garbage can, that one's free.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.282
Yeah, maybe.

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:04.203
Do you agree, Alphys?

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:05.886
I don't know, is anyone doing trash?

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:07.408
Not to me.

00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:33.406
And you can freeze them.

00:09:34.027 --> 00:09:34.687
You can!

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:36.349
But should you.

00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:42.646
And just like that question, Pero should not be getting them.

00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:44.088
No, that's not a question.

00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:45.029
It's an answer.

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:50.414
You need to make sure that you eat lots of them and Pero gets none of them, okay?

00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:54.078
You really want to be pretty, I don't know.

00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:55.340
Why would you want to get Pero for me?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.104
I'm saying if you really, really want to, I'm not suggesting anything, okay?

00:09:59.584 --> 00:10:02.187
But they look delicious!

00:10:02.207 --> 00:10:03.488
Enjoy them, it's okay!

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:07.212
BAU BAU!

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:07.973
Watch out for Pero!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.765
Not for nasty Pero.

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:11.066
Got it.

00:10:11.086 --> 00:10:11.627
Got it.

00:10:11.647 --> 00:10:13.951
But that's what you are for.

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:16.877
BAU BAU!

00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:18.099
BAU BAU!

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:21.566
Well, there's a number of things that happened over this weekend.

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:25.714
And one of them, FUWAMOCO had a lot of fun doing.

00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:30.163
We had a watch-a-long of all for one together with bees and bugs.

00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:33.369
Over at the rat shed!

00:10:33.729 --> 00:10:38.558
The first time FUWAMOCO at the rat shed together with Bae-senpai!

00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:38.959
It was really nice!

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.784
It was both day 1 and 2 very comfy.

00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.728
I got to hug Goose's son.

00:10:44.008 --> 00:10:48.236
It was just a very nice time.

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:48.616
A bit silly.

00:10:48.697 --> 00:10:50.219
You enjoyed it?

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.902
Yeah!

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:52.103
Ruffians!

00:10:52.123 --> 00:10:54.447
Did you see the rats with Bae-senpai?

00:10:54.427 --> 00:11:02.758
But you know, speaking of rants over what happened in New York, there's a lot of them there.

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:14.393
But Ruffians, maybe you were able to go and join us in New York at Radio City Music Hall, but you haven't been able to watch the streaming

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:23.325

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:40.428 --> 00:11:45.074
There's one thing I do want to say, okay?

00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:50.140
There was a bit of a... Not really a misunderstanding.

00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:52.123
We don't have those anymore, Moco-chan.

00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:52.523
A happening.

00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:53.685
I know, I know, I know.

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:56.789
No more misunderstandings, but... A bit of a happening.

00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:57.990
A happening!

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.075
Where I stretched a bit.

00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.980
And my joints, they went...

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:14.104
And I thought maybe you could hear, especially because you said, what was that?

00:12:14.144 --> 00:12:17.069
Was that your joint?

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:20.355
So, we went back and we listened to it.

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:24.281
I thought, if you heard that, that was a pretty good microphone, huh?

00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:26.465
And you were saying it was crunchy before.

00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:30.872
So, you heard well.

00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:32.675
We went back to listen.

00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:34.498
Yeah?

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:40.874
How could you think that was my joints?

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.897
It sounded like all my bones broke.

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:45.100
It was... It was the bag of popcorn.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.822
It was the bag of popcorn.

00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:49.045
Okay.

00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:50.287
I didn't hear Moco-chan's joints crack.

00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:52.009
I laughed so hard.

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:54.172
How did you think that was my joints?

00:12:54.192 --> 00:12:56.174
I was like... Did you hear that?

00:12:56.194 --> 00:12:57.817
I was like, no, I heard the bag crackle.

00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:00.500
It was just perfectly timed because I bumped into the bags.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.022
It went crinkle.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.651
Yeah?

00:13:03.713 --> 00:13:04.554
How did you make that?

00:13:05.757 --> 00:13:06.137
No!

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:08.542
My joints don't sound like popcorn!

00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:09.323
No!

00:13:09.443 --> 00:13:11.227
That would be pretty bad though!

00:13:11.247 --> 00:13:11.728
Right!

00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:15.214
You thought Moco-chan was dusty!

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:17.558
Moco-chan's not dusty!

00:13:17.578 --> 00:13:18.320
Not like that!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.800
No!

00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.890
I would be really worried if, you know, anyone sounded like that when they stretched.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.010
Yeah?

00:13:24.698 --> 00:13:25.379
Okay.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.146
Make sure you stretch Ruffians if you're a little bit crunchy like that.

00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:33.249
We'll see a doctor.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.789
Perhaps.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.251
Perhaps, yeah.

00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:35.411
Okay.

00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:36.793
Because you might be popcorn.

00:13:37.173 --> 00:13:38.795
Yeah.

00:13:38.815 --> 00:13:40.478
But please go and check it out!

00:13:40.578 --> 00:13:46.825
Again, the streaming ticket's in the archives available until September 24th at midnight ENT.

00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:50.210
So maybe you want to see howling once more.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.655
Or lifetime showtime on the big stage for the first time once more!

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:56.297
Now's your chance, Ruffians!

00:13:56.317 --> 00:13:56.858
Don't put it off!

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.522
We put it off before and then we regret it, right?

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:00.303
Regret.

00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:01.865
Yeah.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:03.287
Please go, Ruffians!

00:14:03.307 --> 00:14:05.290
You can take your screenshots, too!

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.856
I heard the Twitter headers are all the rage right now.

00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:14.603
Maybe you can go take a screenshot and make that your header, huh?

00:14:14.623 --> 00:14:15.905
It's not the 21st, it's by the 24th.

00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:16.065
24th.

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.008
24th!

00:14:18.088 --> 00:14:19.890
That's why we're telling you!

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.656
We wouldn't tell you things that were out of date now.

00:14:23.856 --> 00:14:23.916
No.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.298
Please remember, it's the 24th.

00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:29.300
BAU BAU!

00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:38.317
You already used your performance in the battle.

00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:38.497
BAU BAU!

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:40.361
You're on trend, huh?

00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:43.407
Before the trends.

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:45.651
Well, speaking of...

00:14:46.357 --> 00:14:48.139
I'm not good at this.

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.624
Speaking of trendy, because... Always trendy.

00:14:52.644 --> 00:14:52.744
Yeah!

00:14:53.465 --> 00:15:00.453
There was a very special anniversary recently that was celebrated over the weekend!

00:15:00.473 --> 00:15:03.777
It was hololive English's 5th anniversary!

00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:07.701
And they celebrated it with a 3D concert!

00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:08.442
Fortune Spinner!

00:15:08.582 --> 00:15:11.646
On the hololive English official channel!

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:12.607
Yeah, we were able to watch!

00:15:12.627 --> 00:15:15.250
Put your paws up if you watched Ruffians!

00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:18.564
Missed a lot.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.470
Missed the archive, you know.

00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:22.814
Illusion Boy.

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:25.600
Otsume!

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.903
Otsume!

00:15:27.284 --> 00:15:31.534
Now they're going on to their 6th year.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:32.616
It's the 5th year!

00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:35.060
Here comes the 6th year!

00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:41.371
You watched it!

00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:41.551
BAU BAU!

00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:50.586
There was a very touching whole year medley of connect the worlds and breaking dimensions.

00:15:50.566 --> 00:15:54.294
Bibideba was performed too!

00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:54.474
Otonoke!

00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:58.282
Whenever I hear Otonoke I think of Calli-senpai.

00:15:58.342 --> 00:16:04.133
And then of course they performed their new song Fortune Spinner as well!

00:16:04.153 --> 00:16:05.917
They also have a new music video too!

00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:06.578
Did you look?

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:07.460
Did you see it?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.202
Have you listened to it?

00:16:08.222 --> 00:16:10.546
It's now streaming as well!

00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:10.887
Very jazzy!

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:14.654
Wow, what did you think, Ruffians?

00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:16.137
It doesn't need a streaming ticket!

00:16:16.197 --> 00:16:16.698
No streaming ticket!

00:16:16.718 --> 00:16:16.958
No, no, no!

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.924
It's just on the hololive English official account!

00:16:20.906 --> 00:16:21.948
No streaming ticket.

00:16:22.068 --> 00:16:24.473
Kiara-senpai's rock n' roll performance!

00:16:24.553 --> 00:16:26.817
Wow!

00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:45.764
Did you not see the ticket teasers?

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:52.534
I'm singing them!

00:16:52.514 --> 00:16:59.127
Because we are talking about all for when it could be misunderstood, I am just starting to stop the misunderstandings.

00:16:59.147 --> 00:16:59.888
That's all.

00:17:00.028 --> 00:17:00.469
You see?

00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:02.172
The future Moco-chan.

00:17:02.192 --> 00:17:05.338
You need a ticket if you don't want trouble.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:09.166
But maybe sometimes trouble... I don't mind giving up a cookie Moco-chan.

00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:12.953
Trouble could be interesting.

00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:18.191
That's all.

00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:21.416
But we're so happy.

00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:22.117
Yeah, please check it out, okay?

00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:27.766
We've both missed so much and we're looking forward to continuing to have lots of fun all together with them.

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:29.128
All for one, maybe.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:29.889
All for one!

00:17:29.969 --> 00:17:32.153
Yeah, as hololive, yeah!

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:34.276
BAU BAU!

00:17:34.296 --> 00:17:34.637
BAU BAU!

00:17:34.817 --> 00:17:38.944
I think there's gonna be something else fun happening all together this week, too.

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:39.845
Oh, maybe.

00:17:39.865 --> 00:17:40.126
Maybe.

00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.349
But it's a little... It's a little weird.

00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:48.527
BAU BAU!

00:17:50.389 --> 00:17:51.691
Fun things?

00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:52.532
Yeah!

00:17:52.652 --> 00:17:54.194
What fun things?

00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:58.919
I have a question for you.

00:17:59.039 --> 00:17:59.340
For me?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.022
No, not for you!

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.124
It's not me!

00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:08.070
Is Chichi okay?

00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:11.374
Well, it was...

00:18:11.776 --> 00:18:21.148
Her 500,000 subscribers celebration which is her graduation!

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:24.973
GG!

00:18:24.993 --> 00:18:25.153
BAU BAU!

00:18:25.173 --> 00:18:25.693
Wait, uh... Are you okay?

00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:32.462
Cuz, um, apparently her idea of celebrating is a bit... a bit different from ours, I'd say, maybe.

00:18:33.323 --> 00:18:33.483
Yeah.

00:18:33.984 --> 00:18:34.725
A little bit.

00:18:34.745 --> 00:18:36.046
She song... song?

00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:38.950
She... She did a lot of things.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.812
Was she okay?

00:18:40.832 --> 00:18:41.293
Yeah.

00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:43.497
September.

00:18:44.378 --> 00:18:45.039
Yeah.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:45.941
That's 21st.

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.884
That's not now.

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:49.306
I don't know.

00:18:50.889 --> 00:18:51.610
How long was it?

00:18:52.872 --> 00:18:53.533
Crazy.

00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:56.598
Chichi G is not crazy.

00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:58.661
I don't know if she's okay.

00:18:59.382 --> 00:18:59.883
Remember?

00:18:59.903 --> 00:19:00.664
Do you remember?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:02.167
Remember?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:09.458
Well, I... There were things that occurred.

00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:10.533
Yeah?

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:14.739
We had... There was a... Hat?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.701
What?

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.103
What's going on here?

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:18.866
Is that really us?

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:20.248
I don't know, I can't tell.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.252
They look kinda different, Moco-chan.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:23.893
What?

00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:24.554
I can't tell.

00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:25.175
I can't tell.

00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:26.718
I can't see their eyes.

00:19:29.141 --> 00:19:29.241
Yeah.

00:19:31.665 --> 00:19:32.847
What happened here?

00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:36.439
And then, there's other stuff.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.123
Oh, I don't know what's happening there.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:40.966
Oh, weird.

00:19:40.986 --> 00:19:42.248
Who knows what's happening there?

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.211
There's no archive.

00:19:44.312 --> 00:19:46.395
Why is there no archive, Moco-chan?

00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:50.061
Maybe there's a reason because... Who knows?

00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:51.062
We can't see this.

00:19:51.663 --> 00:19:53.586
It's not allowed to be seen anymore.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.653
For reasons.

00:19:57.873 --> 00:20:01.078
Well, I think the answer to the question you remember...

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:02.168
No.

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.869
No.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.270
No.

00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:04.473
I don't remember.

00:20:04.493 --> 00:20:05.415
Nobody remembers.

00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:06.197
I don't know.

00:20:06.217 --> 00:20:10.807
It's September 22nd.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.317
BAU BAU!

00:20:15.337 --> 00:20:16.439
And the answer to it is GGOK.

00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:20.468
We don't remember.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:40.684
BAU BAU!

00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:41.958
5pm?

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:44.764
What time is that?

00:20:44.784 --> 00:20:45.445
Really?

00:20:46.227 --> 00:20:47.930
What time is 19 o'clock?

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:50.436
7pm PD!

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:56.890
FUWAMOCO, we're having our ARRIVAL EVENT in Hoenn!

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:57.070
BAU BAU!

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:04.437
Ruffians, do you know what WHOLE EARTH is?

00:21:04.557 --> 00:21:06.659
Well, now is the perfect time to figure it out.

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:12.464
WHOLE EARTH is a project from cover that's been in development for a long time.

00:21:12.484 --> 00:21:13.825
But now, it's here.

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:24.835
It's the next evolution in bringing whole life, whole life talents together with you in a way not possible before in a new immersive social experience.

00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:27.057
And if you are still confused,

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:28.643
You know what?

00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:33.419
FUWAMOCO's Arrival Fest is the best time to figure it out!

00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:40.866
You can go and download Holo Earth, and then once you log in, then maybe we can all play together!

00:21:40.886 --> 00:21:40.986
Yeah!

00:21:41.006 --> 00:21:44.930
Because for the Arrival Festival, there's a bunch of fun stuff happening!

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.612
There's gonna be new avatar items!

00:21:49.034 --> 00:21:50.055
And fun stuff!

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:50.215
Yes!

00:21:50.235 --> 00:21:53.017
FUWAMOCO shirts just like on the TV!

00:21:53.037 --> 00:21:54.939
The very first shirts that we released!

00:21:54.959 --> 00:21:56.421
Ruffians!

00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:57.181
And headbands!

00:21:57.201 --> 00:21:57.341
Yes!

00:21:57.361 --> 00:21:58.022
Special items!

00:21:58.002 --> 00:22:03.823
Did you just ask them, do you remember?

00:22:03.843 --> 00:22:07.054
You don't, cause the shirts came out a long time ago.

00:22:07.074 --> 00:22:08.198
A lot longer than...

00:22:08.566 --> 00:22:09.627
I'll be cute!

00:22:09.848 --> 00:22:15.655
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:22.924
But there's gonna be lots of motif t-shirts and penlights that you can use to cheer us on.

00:22:22.944 --> 00:22:23.765
Do you recognize them?

00:22:23.785 --> 00:22:24.085
FUWAMOCO Beard!

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:25.006
Do you recognize them?

00:22:25.027 --> 00:22:26.108
Can you tell us where they're from?

00:22:26.468 --> 00:22:30.253
Two different types too.

00:22:30.908 --> 00:22:33.351
Yeah!

00:22:33.411 --> 00:22:34.032
It'll be so much fun.

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.894
I can't wait to use them too.

00:22:35.914 --> 00:22:38.076
I'm gonna cheer you on, Moco-chan.

00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:38.957
Yeah.

00:22:39.678 --> 00:22:41.160
Yeah!

00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:46.506
Wow, there'll be special text plates you can use.

00:22:46.606 --> 00:22:47.948
BAU BAU!

00:22:47.968 --> 00:22:49.349
Yeah, so we can all chat together.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.871
Moco-chan, what does that one say?

00:22:51.672 --> 00:22:52.213
Hi.

00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:53.314
Yeah!

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:57.319
You're gonna go get it now?

00:22:57.339 --> 00:22:58.901
BAU BAU!

00:22:58.921 --> 00:22:59.081
BAU BAU!

00:23:00.002 --> 00:23:00.122
And...

00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:02.829
These are some BAU BAU poses!

00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:04.212
So we can pose all together!

00:23:04.713 --> 00:23:05.716
One for each of us!

00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:09.886
I wanna take a big group photo all together with the Ruffians!

00:23:09.906 --> 00:23:09.986
Yes!

00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:10.207
Like this!

00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:13.254
Can we do it all for you?

00:23:13.274 --> 00:23:13.374
Yes!

00:23:13.394 --> 00:23:14.758
We pose all together!

00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:16.542
Yes!

00:23:16.522 --> 00:23:20.048
There's also a life-size acrylic stand for decoration.

00:23:20.488 --> 00:23:24.655
Wait, so you can go and take photos together with the FUWAMOCO here too?

00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:27.920
I feel sort of embarrassed, I don't know.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.182
This one is sort of embarrassing.

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.906
Moco-chan, can you pose next to me and I'll pose next to you?

00:23:32.147 --> 00:23:32.708
Ah, true!

00:23:32.728 --> 00:23:36.133
You can do a BAU BAU pose next to me!

00:23:36.113 --> 00:23:47.969
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:55.759
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:56.641
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:00.387
We might be able to play it!

00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:01.068
Yeah!

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.352
On the event day all together!

00:24:03.372 --> 00:24:03.472
Yeah!

00:24:03.492 --> 00:24:03.652
Parkour!

00:24:03.672 --> 00:24:03.993
Parkour!

00:24:04.293 --> 00:24:05.576
Yeah!

00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:05.696
Yeah!

00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:08.080
We're really looking forward to it.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:15.052
But Ruffians, if you think you're gonna get creative and make us a special course that we can get all silly and tumble all over the place.

00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:16.614
No one will be skilled.

00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:19.519
But make sure that you make it by

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:25.527
24th, not the 21st, the 24th at 8pm PT.

00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:26.748
You did it!

00:24:26.768 --> 00:24:26.989
You did it!

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:27.610
You could tell what that was!

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.792
Jump out, Moco-chan!

00:24:29.812 --> 00:24:33.757
So you only have about two days left, two and a half days left.

00:24:34.478 --> 00:24:37.663
So if you're interested, please do it, okay?

00:24:37.683 --> 00:24:40.146
I know you can be really creative with your feelings.

00:24:40.767 --> 00:24:47.295
And you know how FUWAMOCO is when it comes to being nice and coordinated.

00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:50.532
Very coordinated.

00:24:50.552 --> 00:24:51.694
Should it be super hard?

00:24:52.195 --> 00:24:53.297
I would say just have fun.

00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:54.899
Be creative.

00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:56.161
It doesn't need to be hard.

00:24:56.201 --> 00:24:57.343
It's not gonna be hard for us.

00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:58.986
You are very creative.

00:24:59.006 --> 00:25:00.468
Do not put yourself down.

00:25:02.131 --> 00:25:03.613
It's not time for the pup.

00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:06.140
Most coordinated doggoes, thank you!

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.881
Thank you!

00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:09.764
Yes, I'm very sorry too.

00:25:09.785 --> 00:25:10.866
Yeah, end!

00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:13.009
Well, there's a special bonus too.

00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:18.616
Maybe there's some Ruffians that still don't really realize how it is free to download.

00:25:18.636 --> 00:25:18.917
Yes, yes!

00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:23.703
But if you log in during this period from the 22nd at 2am PT.

00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:25.205
So, that's now.

00:25:26.306 --> 00:25:26.907
Logging in now.

00:25:26.967 --> 00:25:28.089
If you log in now.

00:25:28.369 --> 00:25:28.710
Now?

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:29.010
Now.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:46.191
Now if the calculations are correct, if you log in now, until the 28th at around 8am PT, you can receive special poppers, fireworks, and the FUWAMOCO text plays right now!

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:53.480
And if you log in during the event itself, you'll get 300 regular holo coins!

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.601
Now!

00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:55.082
Now!

00:25:55.062 --> 00:26:03.291
So please go get your paws on them and we can have a bunch of fun all together during our holo-earth arrival festival.

00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:06.194
You know, we're really happy to be able to do this.

00:26:06.214 --> 00:26:06.335
Right!

00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:08.457
First holo-earth!

00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:12.421
We get to be able to explore holo-earth all together with you.

00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:13.883
We really wanted to figure out what it was.

00:26:14.964 --> 00:26:16.586
BRB, okay!

00:26:16.606 --> 00:26:18.929
We're waiting though!

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:21.011
But where do we download it?

00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.993
If you go to holo-earth...

00:26:22.973 --> 00:26:25.856
hololive website, you can go download it there.

00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:28.139
hololive sync.

00:26:30.962 --> 00:26:34.145
But you know you only get one arrival festival.

00:26:34.165 --> 00:26:34.265
Yeah!

00:26:34.846 --> 00:26:37.509
So here we go, Ruffians.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.150
We can't wait to see you there!

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.611
Maybe there'll be more fun stuff too.

00:26:40.612 --> 00:26:40.953
Maybe.

00:26:40.973 --> 00:26:41.974
I'm sure there will be.

00:26:44.917 --> 00:26:45.077
BAU BAU!

00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:46.859
BAU BAU!

00:26:46.879 --> 00:26:51.124
There's gonna be a bunch of other exciting streams this week too, but...

00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:53.123
Moco-chan.

00:26:53.944 --> 00:26:54.625
I don't know.

00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:55.426
Pup Talk.

00:26:55.786 --> 00:27:02.694
Obviously Ruffians are thinking you need a pup talk because you're already putting yourself down saying you're not creative this early in the morning.

00:27:02.714 --> 00:27:06.799
I think the Ruffians kind of woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

00:27:09.262 --> 00:27:10.263
Obviously.

00:27:10.403 --> 00:27:10.624
Okay, okay.

00:27:10.644 --> 00:27:19.814
I'll give you a pup talk.

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:19.935
Okay.

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:20.335
Ruffians!

00:27:20.855 --> 00:27:23.239
It's that time of the week again!

00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:30.349
I don't know how, but it's already time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.536
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:36.779
Ruffians!

00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:39.042
Ruffians!

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:47.976
You know, are there some days when you wake up and you feel, you know, funny?

00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:50.119
Maybe...

00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:52.038
A bit grumpy.

00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:57.047
Maybe a bit fuzzier than other days.

00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:00.432
Yeah.

00:28:00.452 --> 00:28:02.115
Yeah.

00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:02.536
Wow!

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:05.160
You know what you can do to combat it?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:05.941
Fight it!

00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:11.210
First is to understand that something is up with your heart.

00:28:13.414 --> 00:28:14.195
Try your best!

00:28:14.716 --> 00:28:17.220
You know, maybe call it an early night.

00:28:17.352 --> 00:28:21.338
Oh, and when you can't do a butt.

00:28:22.482 --> 00:28:27.487
I suggest having a kind older sister to help hold the fort down for you.

00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:28.208
Yeah?

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:29.989
Got it!

00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:34.013
It's important to lean on others when you realize you need help.

00:28:34.354 --> 00:28:35.815
So don't forget it, okay?

00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:39.959
Ganbatte ne!

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:40.139
BAU BAU!

00:28:42.542 --> 00:28:42.702
BAU BAU!

00:28:42.722 --> 00:28:47.727
You can count on me, Ruffians, just like Moco-chan does mine.

00:28:48.087 --> 00:28:49.148
I didn't say that, okay?

00:28:49.634 --> 00:28:53.838
But you know, Ruffians, just do your best.

00:28:53.858 --> 00:29:01.084
Maybe there's somebody else really close right beside you too that you can count on as well.

00:29:01.104 --> 00:29:03.866
You can do it, Occhi!

00:29:05.248 --> 00:29:05.468
BAU BAU!

00:29:05.488 --> 00:29:05.568
Wow!

00:29:05.588 --> 00:29:06.008
Let's take a look.

00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:09.031
Who's our Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:18.820
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.040
It's Coco!

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.320
Coco BAU BAU!

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:38.847
She's very brave from this photo.

00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:42.051
Not scared of any fuzzy demon dogs, huh?

00:29:42.841 --> 00:29:43.882
Maybe she should be.

00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:50.251
I don't know, you can see she's sitting right down on you, Moco-chan.

00:29:50.271 --> 00:29:51.573
Swing dominance.

00:29:51.713 --> 00:29:55.478
Maybe you'll sit down on her head!

00:29:55.498 --> 00:29:55.839
Maybe.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.521
Thank you.

00:29:58.162 --> 00:30:00.445
Thank you.

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:00.625
BAU BAU!

00:30:01.026 --> 00:30:04.590
How does Coco BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:10.518
Well, maybe like... BAU BAU!

00:30:10.538 --> 00:30:11.059
BAU BAU!

00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:17.394
It has a very shadowy sound to it too.

00:30:17.574 --> 00:30:21.419
Well, we can tell.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.105
She's a very brave and courageous doggy.

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:29.091
She loves to show her strength in a sassy way, you know?

00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:30.212
Maybe it might get her in trouble.

00:30:31.654 --> 00:30:37.743
Just, you know, make sure that she doesn't sneak up on you or you might be attacked by her warm cuddles.

00:30:38.785 --> 00:30:40.928
That sounds like a nice thing.

00:30:41.583 --> 00:31:05.329
BAU BAU!

00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:17.064
Today I went on a walk.

00:31:17.725 --> 00:31:21.512
Today's walk is... De-den!

00:31:21.492 --> 00:31:23.835
Cute!

00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:27.279
Such a wonderful FUWAMOCO!

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:28.861
Mushrooms!

00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:31.244
Big mushrooms!

00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:31.364
Big!

00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:32.445
Bigger than them.

00:31:33.727 --> 00:31:35.309
And look pretty big here too.

00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:36.831
Those are big mushrooms.

00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:39.814
Now you can tell how big they are, right?

00:31:39.874 --> 00:31:41.476
Yeah!

00:31:41.496 --> 00:31:42.117
I can smell.

00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:52.676
Be careful with wild plants and mushrooms, okay?

00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:52.957
Okay!

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.300
Maybe don't touch them.

00:31:55.683 --> 00:32:03.379
We don't know, it could be poisonous.

00:32:03.663 --> 00:32:09.090
Are you trying to say FUWAMOCO and fungus together?

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.651
No.

00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:11.333
I do like mushrooms though.

00:32:11.393 --> 00:32:14.477
But these are the ones that you just look at and then you go on.

00:32:14.918 --> 00:32:16.660
And then you go to the store and buy some.

00:32:17.421 --> 00:32:19.744
Because mushrooms are meat!

00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:23.489
And the ones at the store are yummy.

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:24.150
For sure.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.131
Don't touch these ones.

00:32:25.668 --> 00:32:28.675
Let's make sure you have lots of fun, okay?

00:32:28.695 --> 00:32:30.779
I hope you find more cool fall things.

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:33.445
Maybe turn over some rocks or logs.

00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:35.489
Try to find what's it, what's it, what's it.

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:36.552
The fairy circle.

00:32:36.572 --> 00:32:40.420
Ah, the mushroom fairy circle.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.445
Have fun!

00:32:45.186 --> 00:32:45.606
BAU BAU!

00:32:45.927 --> 00:32:48.771
Yeah, some cool bugs too maybe!

00:32:49.852 --> 00:32:50.974
BAU BAU!

00:32:51.234 --> 00:32:54.379
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:59.326
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:32:59.346 --> 00:33:01.149
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:33:01.169 --> 00:33:01.409
Hello!

00:33:01.589 --> 00:33:04.213
I'm curious on your organization levels.

00:33:06.961 --> 00:33:10.465
Whenever you get a note on or off stream, where does it go?

00:33:10.886 --> 00:33:12.188
Physical notes?

00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:12.989
Text files?

00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:14.491
Something fancier?

00:33:14.851 --> 00:33:16.133
How many notes are there now?

00:33:17.174 --> 00:33:22.681
Well... It all gets written in one... thing.

00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:23.382
It's a notepad.

00:33:24.003 --> 00:33:24.724
A text file.

00:33:24.744 --> 00:33:28.028
And then when I don't need that note anymore, I delete it.

00:33:28.048 --> 00:33:28.849
Yeah.

00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:30.651
But I think I'll be- Have we saved this file?

00:33:30.811 --> 00:33:32.053
No, it's never been saved.

00:33:32.654 --> 00:33:34.136
I think it autosaves.

00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:34.496
Maybe.

00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:35.297
Maybe.

00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:38.819
Probably, because I've never had a problem.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.100
Yeah.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.101
It's auto-saving.

00:33:41.822 --> 00:33:42.002
Yeah.

00:33:42.582 --> 00:33:48.407
And it has a bunch of ideas that we think of or anything we know that we might forget.

00:33:48.507 --> 00:33:50.449
We just put it right there.

00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:50.829
Yeah.

00:33:50.849 --> 00:33:53.371
Physical notes get lost, so it's all very helpful.

00:33:54.492 --> 00:33:54.813
Yeah.

00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:56.794
I can just scroll, find it.

00:33:57.155 --> 00:33:57.455
Yeah.

00:33:58.076 --> 00:33:59.096
But how many notes?

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.438
I mean, it's just one note.

00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:04.041
It scrolls infinitely.

00:34:04.061 --> 00:34:05.622
That's a long scroll.

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:44.398
Near the top is the plans for the 1 million celebration merchandise sale.

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.821
First year anniversary merchandise.

00:34:49.025 --> 00:34:50.767
None of this was first year, was it?

00:34:53.932 --> 00:34:54.412
Happy?

00:34:56.575 --> 00:34:59.660
Oh that didn't happen though.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.721
I like how it says something.

00:35:01.042 --> 00:35:05.308
It says FUWAMOCO something something brackets probably not.

00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:22.508
And by the way, Fuwawa, I also have a notes document on my computer too.

00:35:24.032 --> 00:35:25.335
Lifetime Showtime!

00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:27.600
Choreo orders!

00:35:28.306 --> 00:35:31.609
Here's some game titles.

00:35:32.911 --> 00:35:35.634
Yeah, ideas for streams.

00:35:36.475 --> 00:35:37.215
It's not saved.

00:35:37.816 --> 00:35:38.417
No.

00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:38.777
No.

00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:41.200
Stream titles.

00:35:44.703 --> 00:35:45.884
More stream ideas.

00:35:48.788 --> 00:35:50.129
What's that stream?

00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:51.611
There's just one stream.

00:35:52.211 --> 00:35:53.993
It's just titled...

00:35:55.171 --> 00:35:56.173
Kitten Stream.

00:35:56.193 --> 00:35:57.094
What was that one?

00:35:57.114 --> 00:35:57.735
I don't know.

00:35:57.796 --> 00:36:00.721
Donkey Kong Country 2 and then Kitten Stream.

00:36:00.821 --> 00:36:02.604
Kitten Stream.

00:36:02.804 --> 00:36:05.088
Hello, hi.

00:36:05.108 --> 00:36:06.651
Here's some sort of karaoke plans.

00:36:06.671 --> 00:36:07.012
Couple songs.

00:36:08.414 --> 00:36:08.855
Setlist.

00:36:10.017 --> 00:36:11.860
Probably everything where like, oh this could happen.

00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:15.947
I think these are requests.

00:36:17.598 --> 00:36:18.720
That's how it goes.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.962
That's how it works, Ruffians.

00:36:20.102 --> 00:36:20.943
And now you know.

00:36:20.963 --> 00:36:24.108
Oh, one says... Wrestling moves.

00:36:26.572 --> 00:36:27.793
That was probably a to-do list.

00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:33.222
That's a good kind of things.

00:36:33.803 --> 00:36:34.764
All this stuff.

00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:37.969
But you know, I think maybe we should go through it, maybe delete some.

00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:38.670
I don't think so.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:39.611
Why should we need to?

00:36:39.651 --> 00:36:40.753
No.

00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:44.394
That's how it works.

00:36:44.434 --> 00:36:46.440
That's what organization levels.

00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:48.967
Just like Moco-chan's downloads folder.

00:36:49.549 --> 00:36:49.990
It's good.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:50.933
I'm more organized.

00:36:50.953 --> 00:36:52.397
Don't delete the memories!

00:36:54.807 --> 00:36:56.970
BAU BAU!

00:36:57.371 --> 00:37:02.058
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.183
Please send us more questions!

00:37:05.925 --> 00:37:07.527
Doggie of the Day is okay!

00:37:07.627 --> 00:37:10.993
I wanna see some very floofy doggies!

00:37:11.493 --> 00:37:14.939
And you know, your vlogs are getting nice and cool.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.448
And if tragedy occurs, please share your Pero sightings.

00:37:20.468 --> 00:37:22.030
Just so that we can all be a FUWAMOCO.

00:37:22.955 --> 00:37:27.545
And most importantly, do not forget to use the hashtag.

00:37:28.006 --> 00:37:31.313
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:37:31.353 --> 00:37:36.164
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:36.184 --> 00:37:36.344
BAU BAU!

00:37:36.364 --> 00:37:39.771
Well, we have some streams coming up soon, Moco-chan!

00:37:39.791 --> 00:37:41.014
Our next team!

00:37:40.994 --> 00:37:48.122
We're gonna be playing Spelunky 2!

00:37:48.142 --> 00:37:52.768
Together with... Autofister!

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:55.831
Whichever one!

00:37:56.672 --> 00:38:00.036
We're gonna be playing F5PFT tonight!

00:38:00.657 --> 00:38:01.338
Tonight!

00:38:01.898 --> 00:38:05.703
So we hope that you'll join us!

00:38:05.723 --> 00:38:05.803
Yes!

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.225
It's a game for players.

00:38:07.245 --> 00:38:09.749
I'm pretty sure, but if it's not, then we'll be three players.

00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:10.670
We'll figure it out.

00:38:12.553 --> 00:38:13.555
But we're really looking forward to it.

00:38:13.575 --> 00:38:14.957
It's a first collab.

00:38:15.518 --> 00:38:15.618
Yeah!

00:38:15.638 --> 00:38:17.421
So, it'll be lots of fun.

00:38:17.681 --> 00:38:18.322
And then!

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:21.267
Actually!

00:38:21.287 --> 00:38:22.228
Right after that!

00:38:22.268 --> 00:38:26.955
We talked about it a bit in members, but we're waiting for FUWAMOCO.

00:38:26.975 --> 00:38:28.217
Right after that!

00:38:28.778 --> 00:38:31.302
We're gonna be playing...

00:38:32.193 --> 00:38:33.979
What are you doing?

00:38:33.999 --> 00:38:36.969
De-den!

00:38:41.183 --> 00:38:44.093
It's gonna be releasing very soon on this one!

00:38:44.663 --> 00:38:48.850
It's gonna be our first pre-release game ever that we're playing!

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:54.258
And not just that, it's gonna be our first Silent Hill game ever too!

00:38:54.278 --> 00:38:54.719
We're really excited!

00:38:54.739 --> 00:39:03.312
This time, Silent Hill F is written by the creator of Higurashi no Naka Korone When They Cry, Ryukishi7!

00:39:03.332 --> 00:39:06.317
And Umioko too!

00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:08.779
Shiori, we have to just go already.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.122
Moco-chan, do you think we'll be okay?

00:39:11.142 --> 00:39:12.723
We can fight, it'll be okay.

00:39:12.743 --> 00:39:13.905
Ruffians are gonna help us.

00:39:14.245 --> 00:39:14.785
You better.

00:39:15.046 --> 00:39:16.167
How, Moco-chan?

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.128
They don't know.

00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:19.310
You better help us.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.272
I don't think they made it inside of the house.

00:39:21.913 --> 00:39:23.054
You better help us.

00:39:24.515 --> 00:39:24.896
Okay.

00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:32.143
We'll have a bunch of fun, Ruffians!

00:39:33.845 --> 00:39:34.625

00:39:34.645 --> 00:39:36.287
Get ready, Ruffians!

00:39:36.622 --> 00:39:38.518
And uh, yeah.

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:41.383
It'll be, maybe, a lot of fun.
