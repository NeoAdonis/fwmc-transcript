00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:10.966
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:13.668
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:24.270
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.112
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:29.073
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.614
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.897
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:36.658
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:38.278
Ruffians!

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:39.419
Are you awake?

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.460
No more 5 more minutes, I saw it!

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.262
You could've confused Moco-chan!

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:47.704
No more 5 more minutes, we're starting now!

00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:51.009
But thank you!

00:05:51.029 --> 00:06:00.272
Despite no more 5 minutes, thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 125th episode!

00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:02.852
BAU BAU!

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:06.594
No more 5 minutes, but we'll take that 5 and we'll put it in the 125th.

00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:08.214
Is that how it works?

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:09.315
That's how it works.

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:12.670
Okay, well, I guess.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.470
BAU BAU!

00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:20.392
Well, for those just waking up, and those maybe joining us for the first time!

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.412
You're always welcome!

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:27.435
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:28.255
A.K.A.

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:29.215
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:29.275 --> 00:06:32.236
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:37.198
Remember, Ruffians, if you remember the days of the week, FUWAMOCO Morning's on you better than Shiori.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:38.318
What?

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:43.921
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:50.304
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:53.566
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:54.186
BAU BAU!

00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:00.509
Ruffians, you understand what I mean, right?

00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:03.110
Moco-chan, you understand what I mean, right?

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.290
I-I guess.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.992
Cause Shiori didn't know until we got to the 100th episode.

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.693
It's like, oh!

00:07:09.853 --> 00:07:11.633
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:12.854
FUWAMOCO.

00:07:12.894 --> 00:07:16.695
It's not the C. We did the Christmas FUWAMOCO already.

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:20.297
No, Ruffians don't understand, no.

00:07:20.337 --> 00:07:20.497
What?

00:07:20.557 --> 00:07:20.837
FWM.

00:07:21.297 --> 00:07:22.878
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:24.338
FUWAMO.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:25.159
Christmas.

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:28.619
Merry Christmas.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.119
BAU BAU!

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.980
If you do that, you're better than Shiori, right?

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.040
I guess.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.721
BAU BAU!

00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:40.841
Let's bring this morning to sunrise.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.462
With some bad news!

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:47.243
Bad news.

00:07:48.243 --> 00:07:50.923
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:52.303
Pero Sighting.

00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:55.004
Let's take a look where he is again.

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:57.729
Rip off the band-aid.

00:07:57.849 --> 00:07:59.770
Is he at another warehouse or something?

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.630
That's what you wanna do first thing in the morning.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.010
Rip off the band-aid.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.431
Let's see what he looks like.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:07.411
De-den!

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:10.992
Birthday lunch!

00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:11.932
With friends!

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:12.952
Yeah!

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:17.453
But he's sort of in a band-aid shape, but... Nevermind.

00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:21.113
A nasty surprise on your birthday.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:24.134
His eyes... They're so shiny!

00:08:24.194 --> 00:08:25.114
Kinda shiny.

00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:29.976
Yeah, the omelette kind of even looks... Fluffy!

00:08:30.597 --> 00:08:31.398
Hot!

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.240
Salad looks pretty fresh.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.921
Not fuzzy.

00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:35.182
Yeah, not fuzzy.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:36.043
Not a fuzzy salad.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.745
You don't want a fuzzy salad!

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:41.470
Yeah, I bet you know it's all delicious.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.691
But, uh...

00:08:43.872 --> 00:08:50.076
Maybe, you know, just this time, you kind of have to help out by cleaning up this trash.

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:50.877
Yeah!

00:08:50.937 --> 00:08:53.338
Sticking a knife right into the middle.

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:54.639
Clean it all up.

00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:55.639
Yeah.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.182
You know, cleaning up the trash on your birthday.

00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:00.863
Is that okay, Moco-chan?

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:02.644
It's a nice thing to do, I guess.

00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:03.564
Right.

00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:06.186
It's my birthday, but I'll take out the trash.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:07.066
Right.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:07.667
Wow.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.648
Yeah, very nice thing.

00:09:10.242 --> 00:09:11.283
Yeah, thank you!

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:18.630
Thank you for making the world a better place by cleaning up this trash, getting rid of the nastiness.

00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:22.174
Yeah, cleaning up the nastiness, huh?

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:22.834
Yeah, right?

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:23.195
Very good.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:24.096
That's so good though.

00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:26.338
No, it's just horrible trash.

00:09:26.798 --> 00:09:27.399
Nasty.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.500
But we'll eat it.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.241
It's probably delicious.

00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:31.879
BAU BAU!

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:33.740
I hope you had a good birthday despite it all!

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:40.204
Happy birthday!

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:41.587
BAU BAU!

00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:42.328
BAU BAU!

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:49.062
Well, chat's just said... Ruffians! Something really big just happened!

00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:52.188
In hololive English history!

00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:53.130
That big!

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.971
That big!

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.555
Do you know what it is, Ruffians?

00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.315
hololive English history we're talking!

00:09:59.335 --> 00:10:00.416
Breaking Dimensions, yes, but... But!

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:13.229
Well... Our shark senpai from hololive English -Myth-, Gura-senpai!

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:15.753
Gura-senpai just revealed her 2.0!

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:20.353
Did you see?

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:20.734
Look!

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.115
Look at it here!

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.636
Look how cute Gura-senpai is!

00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:27.839
It's absolutely amazing!

00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:28.279
Amazing!

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:28.740
Right?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.360
Snazzy!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:29.740
Yeah!

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.341
Snazzy!

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:35.104
You know, it's like Gura-senpai after a really really nice spa treatment.

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:36.565
It's a spa treatment!

00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:36.766
Yeah!

00:10:36.926 --> 00:10:38.447
Spa treatment for a sock!

00:10:39.227 --> 00:10:40.649
Sharks need a spa day.

00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:41.410
Why not?

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.391
Some bubbles.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:44.273
Extra bubbles.

00:10:44.573 --> 00:10:46.295
Maybe like a sand bath.

00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:48.898
I like sand paper.

00:10:48.918 --> 00:10:50.279
Sharks take sand baths.

00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:53.583
That's kind of regular for them though.

00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:55.965
Mud bath.

00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:57.987
Mud bath sounds so regular maybe.

00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:00.613
Baby.

00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:03.598
I don't know.

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:08.765
But you know now Gura-senpai she moves so fluidly.

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:10.628
Looks so cute.

00:11:10.668 --> 00:11:13.151
Especially with that... The cat shark move.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.521
Yeah!

00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:19.582
Can you believe it?

00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:21.823
Kuro-senpai got even cuter!

00:11:21.943 --> 00:11:25.306
I didn't think it was possible, Ruffians!

00:11:25.766 --> 00:11:28.188
Mine's super fluid now!

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:28.969
Yeah.

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:29.869
Look at that face!

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:31.450
Yeah, just like that!

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.152
But my teeth are still there!

00:11:34.212 --> 00:11:34.493
Yeah!

00:11:34.533 --> 00:11:36.634
Didn't take away her teeth.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.255
No.

00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:37.795
I know.

00:11:38.075 --> 00:11:38.996
She's a shark, you know.

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:41.097
She needs her teeth, you know?

00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:46.419
We're just so happy that Gura-senpai got a bit of a makeover, you know?

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:50.661
You know, she just must be so elated too!

00:11:50.741 --> 00:11:54.202
Congratulations, Gura-senpai!

00:11:54.602 --> 00:11:56.243
Yeah, no one can take the fangs.

00:11:56.263 --> 00:11:57.383
No, no, no, no.

00:11:57.443 --> 00:11:58.604
No bottom teeth though.

00:11:58.624 --> 00:12:06.187
You have to take all the bottom teeth and still really, really do some damage, huh?

00:12:08.487 --> 00:12:10.968
Cute is the priority, right?

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:12.269
Extreme violence later.

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:13.270
That's our motto.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:20.554
I really hope that I can get to see Gura-senpai's cute face lots and lots!

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:23.576
BAU BAU!

00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:25.797
BAU BAU!

00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:26.998
Baudotiti?

00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:27.318
No!

00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:30.760
Can't have too much of a good thing, right?

00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:34.762
Do we need... Moco-chan!

00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:36.503
Oh, are you sad?

00:12:37.846 --> 00:12:39.927
Would you like me more if I had teeth?

00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:44.489
Moco-chan, we're making this about you again!

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.569
How?

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.932
Look, I can eat so well.

00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:54.554
We have fangs, Ruffians!

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:55.715
Look at my fangs!

00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:59.016
Watch out!

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.077
Watch out!

00:13:00.097 --> 00:13:00.357
Yeah.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.379
They might just not be as sharp as a shark.

00:13:07.739 --> 00:13:09.921
But that's because we're demon dogs!

00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.242
It's sharp on my claws!

00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:12.722
Yeah.

00:13:13.142 --> 00:13:14.043
Watch out for the claws.

00:13:14.063 --> 00:13:16.024
But I will validate the tickets, okay?

00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:17.085
Yeah, we can do that.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:17.685
Yeah.

00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:20.742
BAU BAU!

00:13:20.762 --> 00:13:21.464
BAU BAU!

00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:24.974
There's also some really big news too!

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:26.258
Incredible news!

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:27.080
Yeah!

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.630
You know, Advent, we just had our first anniversary!

00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:32.253
Which means...

00:13:32.753 --> 00:13:33.574
ReGLOSS!

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:38.037
ReGLOSS is now celebrating their first anniversary too!

00:13:38.097 --> 00:13:39.337
BAU BAU!

00:13:40.518 --> 00:13:44.801
And of course the first anniversary comes with a bunch of cool things going on!

00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:52.467
Well, they just released their newest song, Feeling Gradation!

00:13:52.827 --> 00:13:55.149
And it has a fully animated MV!

00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:57.231
It's so amazing!

00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:58.532
They're dancing!

00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.453
Yeah, dancing, singing!

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:05.938
All, you know, just like beautiful idols in animated glory!

00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:06.278
Yeah!

00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:07.399
You better go check it out!

00:14:07.439 --> 00:14:08.080
Yeah, look!

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.861
Look at them all there!

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.282
Ririka, Tami.

00:14:11.923 --> 00:14:13.104
Oh, Moco-chan.

00:14:15.543 --> 00:14:15.923
Excuse me.

00:14:16.003 --> 00:14:17.924
I've been thinking huh?

00:14:18.244 --> 00:14:20.944
That is looking kind of fluffy there.

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:26.605
Hi!

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:28.686
Hi!

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:31.967
Then we got some great outfits!

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:36.548
But not just a brand new song with an amazing MV.

00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:37.648
Not just that!

00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:38.508
But!

00:14:38.988 --> 00:14:39.748
We got!

00:14:40.128 --> 00:14:42.669
They'll be having their 3 day debut!

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:48.810
It's gonna be on September 28th GST!

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.410
Their first 3D online concert!

00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:53.671
Are you ready?

00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:54.751
Reach the top.

00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:56.271
Yeah, reach the top.

00:14:56.351 --> 00:14:58.151
So close and too short, Kai.

00:14:58.492 --> 00:14:58.832
What?

00:14:59.012 --> 00:14:59.772
Moco-chan!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:03.692
They can't reach the top because they're too short!

00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:05.513
We're 155 centimeters.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.153
I'm not seeing anything.

00:15:09.173 --> 00:15:12.854
I think we have to reach the top too.

00:15:17.979 --> 00:15:20.401
But we just can't wait, you know.

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.265
3D debut means we get to see their singing, their dancing!

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.367
I wonder what it'll be like, maybe.

00:15:29.368 --> 00:15:31.770
Well, we don't have to wait too long.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:37.855
Just in a few weeks, on the 28th, JST, we'll be able to see them on 3D!

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:40.537
And, not just that.

00:15:40.677 --> 00:15:41.678
Not just that!

00:15:41.698 --> 00:15:43.199
There's been so many announcements!

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.860
But there's more!

00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:51.724
Wow, Wigwoss will also be releasing an album filled with 8 songs!

00:15:51.744 --> 00:15:52.905
8 full songs!

00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:53.885
Full songs!

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:55.486
Oh my gosh!

00:15:56.386 --> 00:16:01.669
Makes sense, you know Wigwoss being the idol group that they all write together.

00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:02.129
Right!

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:03.070
No way!

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.211
Writing 8 songs!

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:06.852
A whole full album!

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:07.312
Yeah!

00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:10.328
Let's go!

00:16:10.388 --> 00:16:10.888
Let's go!

00:16:11.068 --> 00:16:11.269
Yeah!

00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:13.391
We can't wait to hear what it sounds like!

00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.391
Right!

00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:18.455
Oh, what kind of ReGLOSS are they gonna show us with their new music?

00:16:18.776 --> 00:16:19.556
Glossier?

00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:20.938
Glossier?

00:16:21.118 --> 00:16:26.523
I don't... If they become glossier, they might just... Gloss into the universe.

00:16:27.304 --> 00:16:28.545
We need that to stay here.

00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:29.385
Yeah.

00:16:30.802 --> 00:16:32.183
BAU BAU!

00:16:49.021 --> 00:16:57.089
Ruffians, have you noticed something going on, you know, with FUWAMOCO here?

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:13.292
You know, have you maybe smelled a certain scent from FUWAMOCO?

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:13.452
What?

00:17:14.472 --> 00:17:16.153
Extreme violence!

00:17:16.273 --> 00:17:16.914
Yeah!

00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.855
The scent of extreme violence we have!

00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:25.878
Cause right now we have a special collab together with World of Tanks Blitz!

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:27.059
Oh!

00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:30.562
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:44.880
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.161
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.254
But you know, FUWAMOCO will help you in the best areas possible.

00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:09.978
You know, things like, you know, getting our special collectible FUWAMOCO donut.

00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:12.760
You know, a donut is very important to a tank.

00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:13.561
It is!

00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:15.062
It's what tanks run on.

00:18:15.343 --> 00:18:18.185
You may think, oh they run on whatever tanks run on.

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:20.206
But they run on donuts.

00:18:20.346 --> 00:18:22.607
Donuts are a very important part.

00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:25.048
There's other things too, you know.

00:18:25.088 --> 00:18:27.609
Special FUWAMOCO avatars.

00:18:27.749 --> 00:18:32.752
Also a snazzy FUWAMOCO skin that you can use just for your tag too.

00:18:32.972 --> 00:18:34.273
I'm a fuzz.

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:37.434
So yeah, please go check it out, okay?

00:18:37.474 --> 00:18:40.896
We're together with our senpai and our biboo too.

00:18:40.916 --> 00:18:43.157
If you ever want to miss it, it will end.

00:18:43.877 --> 00:18:47.159
February 27th is on right now, so check it out!

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.060
Go check it out!

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.263
You can finally get the FUWAMOCO Iida tank of your dreams too!

00:18:52.283 --> 00:18:53.824
You've all been waiting for it, right?

00:18:54.144 --> 00:18:54.565
Right.

00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:56.746
You want... That's always what you dreamed about.

00:18:56.766 --> 00:18:59.508
Forget the Iida car!

00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:03.051
Forget, you know, new original song, FUWAMOCO tank.

00:19:05.152 --> 00:19:09.435
FUWAMOCO, please go check out one of those tanks, please!

00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:12.837
Thanks, you're welcome!

00:19:12.877 --> 00:19:13.838
You're welcome!

00:19:13.878 --> 00:19:15.639
You don't have to thank me so much.

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:17.480
You're welcome, okay?

00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:19.381
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:20.882
You get my joke?

00:19:22.003 --> 00:19:22.844
I finally do.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.781
You're welcome!

00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:32.922
BAU BAU!

00:19:32.942 --> 00:19:35.723
Oh, I like the title, World of Thanks Blitz.

00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:37.083
World of Thanks?

00:19:37.163 --> 00:19:39.844
Yeah, it's a positive world, you know.

00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:41.705
So much thanks.

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:42.465
Wow.

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.113
No, not World of Thanks.

00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:46.493
World of Thanks!

00:19:46.794 --> 00:19:47.894
World of Time Splits.

00:19:47.934 --> 00:19:50.856
BAU BAU!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.717
BAU BAU!

00:19:52.777 --> 00:19:55.098
What was that?

00:19:55.458 --> 00:20:01.042
I was just worried that maybe we continued this corner even before we got to it.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:10.407
That's what I was thinking too.

00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:10.727
Ruffians!

00:20:11.447 --> 00:20:12.068
There's been a...

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.841
Misunderstanding.

00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:19.482
Hopefully nothing new other than... Yeah.

00:20:20.202 --> 00:20:24.984
It's been a while, but it's been a misunderstanding, Ruffians.

00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:27.085
Yuto!

00:20:27.545 --> 00:20:28.845
First of all!

00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:31.186
We had anorecho, right?

00:20:31.226 --> 00:20:31.426
Yeah!

00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:32.847
Anomatic recollection.

00:20:33.227 --> 00:20:34.847
Do you remember what that was?

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:36.148
It was so long ago.

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.529
I hope your memories didn't get wiped.

00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:40.349
That would be really horrible.

00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:41.090
We don't want that.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:41.990
Yeah.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.334
But it was a big event that all of hololive English was a part of!

00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:57.660
We went into a very special world, the kingdom of Lobesto, in a place that's kind of looking familiar to Minecraft, but different!

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.501
And we solved some mysteries.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:03.063
Maybe got some memories back, maybe didn't.

00:21:03.103 --> 00:21:05.785
Maybe there was some sad things.

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:06.225
But!

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:06.785
Oh!

00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:08.647
The most important thing that I feel like

00:21:09.387 --> 00:21:10.628
Many people forgot.

00:21:10.828 --> 00:21:12.569
Oh, is that not their memories?

00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:13.409
No.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.870
Oh.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.931
And a record is roleplay.

00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:18.332
Ah!

00:21:18.452 --> 00:21:19.873
What does that mean, Moco-chan?

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:26.337
That means that the Fuwawa and the Mococo that you see there are different.

00:21:26.697 --> 00:21:27.698
Different?

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:31.040
Different, like, different, different.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.320
Ah!

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.421
It's not, it's not.

00:21:34.864 --> 00:21:36.165
Mococo!

00:21:36.705 --> 00:21:39.106
You're not Mococo, you're Mococo.

00:21:39.126 --> 00:21:42.727
You put it like that?

00:21:42.787 --> 00:21:43.027
Yes.

00:21:44.447 --> 00:21:49.129
You remember that now?

00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:51.250
Well, it's FWC.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.691
The FW is a little different, right?

00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:56.451
You know, the FW is FWC.

00:21:58.393 --> 00:21:58.653
Wow.

00:21:59.353 --> 00:22:00.814
She really loves her chickens.

00:22:01.314 --> 00:22:01.434
Ah!

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:02.575
Bread smell!

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.117
But the Fuwawa never go love the chickens.

00:22:06.517 --> 00:22:10.038
It doesn't mean that the Fuwawa here right now doesn't like chickens too, huh?

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:11.039
They're handy.

00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:11.679
Fluffy.

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:13.180
Sometimes.

00:22:13.877 --> 00:22:21.279
Ruffians, you should be looking at this, right?

00:22:37.555 --> 00:22:39.297
Did you notice the difference?

00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:39.938
The cape!

00:22:40.098 --> 00:22:40.759
Not the cape.

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:43.362
You thought it was just the cape, huh?

00:22:43.522 --> 00:22:44.783
But you were wrong!

00:22:44.803 --> 00:22:46.005
Not the cape.

00:22:50.718 --> 00:22:50.919
Oh!

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:52.099
I see- Oh!

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.861
Two Ruffians- Three Ruffians!

00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:54.421
Yes!

00:22:55.242 --> 00:22:57.364
No headband!

00:22:57.824 --> 00:22:59.045
Yeah!

00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:03.008
See the Mocoi- Mococo!

00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:14.338
The Mococo with no headband was thought to have mercilessly killed- Mercilessly killed Fuwawa's beloved chickens.

00:23:17.254 --> 00:23:20.496
Actually, that Mococo is innocent!

00:23:33.002 --> 00:23:34.022
No, no, no.

00:23:34.082 --> 00:23:35.082
What happened?

00:23:35.222 --> 00:23:36.103
What happened?

00:23:36.523 --> 00:23:39.963
She was trying to close the gate door into the chicken pen.

00:23:40.183 --> 00:23:42.904
So that all the chickens stay inside the pen.

00:23:42.924 --> 00:23:46.304
Because Fuwawa's friend is trying to be helpful.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:53.046
But she mis-pressed the button and used revelation and killed them all.

00:23:54.126 --> 00:23:56.626
That was pretty horrifying to watch, huh?

00:23:57.126 --> 00:24:01.247
If you go back and listen, you can hear the horror in her voice, okay?

00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:03.939
I'm innocent.

00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:05.580
Likely story.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.381
Likely story, Hans.

00:24:07.702 --> 00:24:08.022
No!

00:24:08.442 --> 00:24:09.783
It's a misunderstanding!

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.404
You understand now.

00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:13.946
Not join!

00:24:14.026 --> 00:24:17.428
You have to go take a look at the evidence of maybe Ruffians.

00:24:17.448 --> 00:24:17.668
Okay.

00:24:17.908 --> 00:24:20.490
And then you can be true.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.211
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:24:22.271 --> 00:24:23.732
We are telling them!

00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:26.493
It is a misunderstanding!

00:24:26.513 --> 00:24:28.435
This is the truth.

00:24:28.975 --> 00:24:30.316
That's how a misunderstanding goes.

00:24:30.356 --> 00:24:31.517
Now you say, I understand.

00:24:32.556 --> 00:24:36.918
Has been a long time, but that's... Understandable.

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:37.719
Got it?

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.580
I didn't say understandable.

00:24:41.341 --> 00:24:41.921
Got it?

00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:43.322
I understand.

00:24:43.342 --> 00:24:45.843
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:24:46.504 --> 00:24:47.424
I understand.

00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:47.504
Yes.

00:24:48.124 --> 00:24:49.605
Got it?

00:24:49.645 --> 00:24:50.526
I understand.

00:24:50.546 --> 00:24:51.606
BAU BAU!

00:24:52.047 --> 00:24:54.828
BAU BAU!

00:24:54.888 --> 00:24:56.429
Misunderstanding.

00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:57.750
Misunderstanding?

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:58.570
Clear.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.071
World of Tanks Blitz.

00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:03.984
BAU BAU!

00:25:06.846 --> 00:25:07.947
Well, it's Wednesday.

00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:09.969
It's Wednesday.

00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:13.473
Are you ready for Wednesday, Ruffians?

00:25:14.634 --> 00:25:15.595
Wednesday.

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:19.698
Has it been a little rough so far this week?

00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.880
Wednesday.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.282
Maybe it's been a bit.

00:25:23.602 --> 00:25:25.344
Well, Wednesday's gonna be rough too.

00:25:26.707 --> 00:25:30.269
Maybe Moco-chan, you can make it not so rough on a Wednesday.

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:34.491
BAU BAU!

00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.291
Ruffians!

00:25:37.852 --> 00:25:41.254
I think you should know what day it is, huh?

00:25:42.134 --> 00:25:45.095
Wednesday!

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:49.897
Because this year is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:25:50.598 --> 00:25:52.759
So you're gonna shoot straight from me.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:53.599
Mococo!

00:25:56.432 --> 00:25:59.235
Ruffians, it's Wednesday!

00:26:01.317 --> 00:26:02.038
And you know what?

00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:04.680
I feel like today...

00:26:06.162 --> 00:26:10.104
This year is going to be a different kind of Pup Talk.

00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:14.967
Today, I want to bless you with good feelings!

00:26:14.987 --> 00:26:18.669
It's not like every week I don't want to bless you with good feelings, but today especially!

00:26:18.989 --> 00:26:20.770
I want to bless you with good feelings!

00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:22.011
Okay.

00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:25.013
So, here I go!

00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:26.794
Wake up refreshed!

00:26:27.114 --> 00:26:28.154
Lots of energy!

00:26:28.475 --> 00:26:29.535
Voice is happy!

00:26:29.976 --> 00:26:30.696
A on the test!

00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:32.197
This is so comfortable!

00:26:32.637 --> 00:26:33.718
Super FUWAMOCO!

00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:45.615
That was a bit different.

00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:47.195
Yeah, it was Pup Talk mix.

00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:49.116
Pup Talk mix?

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:50.676
Fire!

00:26:50.996 --> 00:26:51.616
Fire!

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:52.456
Fire!

00:26:52.697 --> 00:26:53.177
Pup Talk.

00:26:53.757 --> 00:26:54.577
Boss is happy!

00:26:54.617 --> 00:26:55.597
It's a good time!

00:26:55.737 --> 00:26:58.658
It's a good time!

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.041
Good luck everyone!

00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:04.542
BAU BAU!

00:27:04.682 --> 00:27:08.543
Well, let's take a look at our regular corners now.

00:27:08.563 --> 00:27:10.964
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:12.925
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:13.105 --> 00:27:15.626
We have De-den!

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:17.907
Today's Doggie of the Day is Sienna!

00:27:17.967 --> 00:27:19.407
Sienna!

00:27:19.447 --> 00:27:20.908
She has cute eyes.

00:27:21.268 --> 00:27:22.669
Big puppy dog eyes.

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:24.529
Oh, it's a voice.

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:25.109
Right!

00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:26.790
Look at those eyebrows, too!

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.790
Yeah, so curious!

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.111
Yeah, those are so fleek!

00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:31.711
Right!

00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:36.392
Sienna's a rescue and super duper cute!

00:27:36.552 --> 00:27:38.212
And then she rescued you, right?

00:27:38.672 --> 00:27:39.232
Right!

00:27:39.312 --> 00:27:41.233
She rescued you!

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.113
But look, she's just a big puppy!

00:27:44.393 --> 00:27:49.874
A big puppy with a big barker and an even bigger heart!

00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:51.875
And guess what, Moco-chan?

00:27:52.895 --> 00:27:56.736
Sienna loves to give overbearing cuddles too.

00:27:57.216 --> 00:27:57.916
Does she?

00:27:58.137 --> 00:27:58.677
Yeah.

00:27:59.817 --> 00:27:59.957
Oh.

00:28:00.737 --> 00:28:00.937
Oh.

00:28:01.137 --> 00:28:01.638
Interesting.

00:28:02.318 --> 00:28:03.298
Very cute.

00:28:03.418 --> 00:28:04.738
Very cute!

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:08.860
FUWAMOCO-chan, how do you think Sienna BAU BAUs?

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.821
I think like, when she wants to cuddle.

00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:15.141
BAU BAU!

00:28:15.982 --> 00:28:16.522
BAU BAU!

00:28:18.307 --> 00:28:20.411
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:28:30.863 --> 00:28:31.424
BAU BAU!

00:28:31.564 --> 00:28:33.565
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:36.228
Wow, I don't need to say this really.

00:28:36.268 --> 00:28:38.149
We can all tell already.

00:28:38.449 --> 00:28:40.551
But Sienna's just so sweet.

00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:45.655
And you can see in those eyes just how happy she is to be a part of your family.

00:28:45.775 --> 00:28:47.056
A part of your heart!

00:28:48.037 --> 00:28:51.300
I hope that you know she lays on your lap even more.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.823
And that maybe she'll share some of those cuddles with us too.

00:28:55.863 --> 00:28:56.824
Yeah, okay!

00:28:56.844 --> 00:28:58.726
Nobody doesn't like cuddles.

00:28:59.296 --> 00:29:00.497
Right cuddles, please.

00:29:01.357 --> 00:29:03.519
BAU BAU!

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.822
Next we have our Today I Went On A Walk!

00:29:09.203 --> 00:29:12.925
We have De-den!

00:29:13.646 --> 00:29:17.528
I like this kind of walk!

00:29:17.608 --> 00:29:20.710
Miracle boy!

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.952
Your calico buddy blessed you with presents!

00:29:23.992 --> 00:29:25.333
You have been blessed!

00:29:25.674 --> 00:29:27.495
Oh my gosh!

00:29:27.855 --> 00:29:29.196
Treat, huh?

00:29:29.276 --> 00:29:30.216
In many ways.

00:29:31.197 --> 00:29:33.198
A treat for you, maybe.

00:29:33.558 --> 00:29:38.681
You have a treat there for the calico boy, too.

00:29:38.841 --> 00:29:42.503
Well, FUWAMOCO, we recommend this cat treat.

00:29:43.104 --> 00:29:44.304
Churu.

00:29:44.404 --> 00:29:48.887
I've heard that all cats can't resist the churu.

00:29:48.927 --> 00:29:50.788
Some less than others.

00:29:51.609 --> 00:29:52.029
Young.

00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:53.950
Young, huh?

00:29:55.392 --> 00:30:00.775
Bring Calico Buddy a churu and I'm sure... She'll be happy.

00:30:00.815 --> 00:30:01.515
He'll be happy.

00:30:02.216 --> 00:30:03.316
Buddy will be happy.

00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:03.896
Yeah.

00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:05.137
Hi!

00:30:06.018 --> 00:30:08.819
I saw some Calico facts there!

00:30:08.879 --> 00:30:09.679
Calico facts?

00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:13.221
Yeah, that Calico cats are 99% girls.

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:14.442
I don't care!

00:30:14.862 --> 00:30:18.104
Cats are cute and that's all that matters!

00:30:20.145 --> 00:30:26.048
Well, you know if you bring some churu, maybe a calico bunny will be there lots in the future.

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:32.672
And then you can have lots of fun with your calico-flavored walks.

00:30:32.732 --> 00:30:36.614
BAU BAU!

00:30:36.714 --> 00:30:37.294
So cute.

00:30:37.354 --> 00:30:39.695
I want to go on walks like that too.

00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:42.817
Teach me how to find walks like that.

00:30:43.517 --> 00:30:47.700
Well, on our Question of the Day, we have de-den!

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.804
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:30:51.884 --> 00:30:53.927
Summer is almost over.

00:30:54.147 --> 00:30:58.653
Do Fuwawa and Mococo have anything they would like to do or eat in the fall?

00:30:59.174 --> 00:31:05.462
It's also the season of sweet potatoes, so there will be many delicious sweets and other delicacies.

00:31:08.572 --> 00:31:10.273
First a secret, Ruffians!

00:31:10.653 --> 00:31:19.256
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, I did partake in a fall delicacy shortly beforehand, and I made a mistake.

00:31:19.697 --> 00:31:21.277
You know we have the delicious Sama.

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:24.879
The Sama fish is good in the fall time.

00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:29.020
And so all FUWAMOCO Morning, I had a bone stuck in my throat.

00:31:29.241 --> 00:31:29.521
Yes.

00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:30.061
Yes.

00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:32.867
But!

00:31:32.927 --> 00:31:34.928
We really like sweet potatoes too!

00:31:34.948 --> 00:31:41.309
But Fuwawa, the whole time before hajimaru said, I don't know what I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna have.

00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:44.170
I couldn't get most of them because I have a bullet in my throat.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.550
I have to be like, Ruffians, I'm sorry right now!

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.711
The summer, it's stuck!

00:31:50.071 --> 00:31:50.851
I'm sorry!

00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.311
But that's okay!

00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.412
You have to be careful, okay?

00:31:54.472 --> 00:31:56.632
But sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes!

00:31:57.072 --> 00:31:59.613
I wanna find the Yankee Moji-san!

00:31:59.713 --> 00:32:01.373
And then we wanna buy it all!

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:05.694
Yaki-mo.

00:32:06.154 --> 00:32:08.675
Yaki-mo.

00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:19.538
I want to buy all the best potatoes in the Yaki-mo ojisan.

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:27.000
You just hear the song in the distance and then... I'm looking forward to it.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.324
The fall time is wonderful too!

00:32:30.484 --> 00:32:35.031
It was a wonderful summer, but I'm sure there's going to be a wonderful fall waiting for us too!

00:32:35.071 --> 00:32:36.573
Let's make it fun again!

00:32:37.034 --> 00:32:39.177
BAU BAU!

00:32:39.217 --> 00:32:40.158
Thank you so much!

00:32:42.862 --> 00:32:45.204
I don't hear the day, the Question of the Day!

00:32:45.244 --> 00:32:45.584
Why?

00:32:45.624 --> 00:32:49.047
For sharing your walks with us, your Pero Sightings!

00:32:49.547 --> 00:32:50.608
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:32:50.688 --> 00:32:51.188
Thank you!

00:32:51.248 --> 00:32:55.532
Let's continue to be a big and fortified FUWAMOCO Morning by using the hashtag!

00:32:55.992 --> 00:32:56.612
Hashtag!

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:59.034
FWMCMORNING!

00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:01.416
BAU BAU!

00:33:01.956 --> 00:33:06.420
Wow, next we have another stream coming right on up right!

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.541
We have De-den!

00:33:08.982 --> 00:33:12.365
We're gonna be playing Elite Exorcist Miko!

00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:15.047
The newest game from hololive AP!

00:33:15.087 --> 00:33:16.488
It looks super fun.

00:33:16.508 --> 00:33:18.070
I'm really excited.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.674
It looks very very addicting but we're gonna make it.

00:33:23.802 --> 00:33:24.443
Are we?

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:32.829
I know my Senchou-senpai was talking of great things about this game, so I'm very excited to try it out all together with you, my friends!

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:35.271
Let's have a bunch of fun, okay?

00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:35.671
Okay!

00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:36.672
BAU BAU!

00:33:36.732 --> 00:33:37.773
BAU BAU!

00:33:37.813 --> 00:33:39.394
Let's take a peek at our schedule!

00:33:39.454 --> 00:33:41.135
FUWAMOCO's schedule!

00:33:41.495 --> 00:33:46.559
Oh, but... Unfortunately, earlier we couldn't quite play Donkey Kong Country 2, but... I'm sorry.

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:49.622
Moco-chan, you're feeling much better from your mic right now.

00:33:49.662 --> 00:33:50.062
Yeah, I still...

00:33:50.959 --> 00:33:52.026
It's funny!

00:33:54.142 --> 00:33:56.664
It notches my head that hurts after everything hurts.

00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.286
But we're getting better, okay?

00:33:59.326 --> 00:34:02.449
We'll say hello to Donkey Kong Country 2 next week!

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:09.835
And then on Friday, we have FUWAMOCO Morning followed by a nice cozy chat while we do some super chat reading.

00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:15.059
And then on Saturday, it's time for a rock n' roar party!

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.600
Rock n' roar time!

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.322
We hope you're ready, Ruffians.

00:34:18.762 --> 00:34:21.825
And then on Sunday, it's been a while since our last horror game.

00:34:22.265 --> 00:34:23.326
Maybe that was a good thing.

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:26.008
But we're gonna be going to a bathhouse.

00:34:26.508 --> 00:34:27.549
One said two.

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:28.830
A restored bathhouse.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.392
And hopefully we won't see anything scary.

00:34:31.412 --> 00:34:31.552
Yeah.

00:34:32.432 --> 00:34:32.933
Hopefully.

00:34:32.993 --> 00:34:33.473
Hopefully.

00:34:34.434 --> 00:34:37.416
And that's our schedule for this week, Ruffians!

00:34:37.776 --> 00:34:37.936
Oh!

00:34:38.236 --> 00:34:44.381
And for Ruffians who are joining us this morning through the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO Rune!
