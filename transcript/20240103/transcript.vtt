05:13.206 --> 05:15.428
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:16.849 --> 05:20.392
It's time for... What?

05:21.012 --> 05:24.775
It's time for... FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:25.035 --> 05:27.157
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:28.938 --> 05:29.739
It's official.

05:29.779 --> 05:32.201
The morning is ruined, ruffians!

05:33.962 --> 05:35.263
I'm not a chihuahua!

05:35.924 --> 05:37.325
I'm Fuwawa!

05:38.479 --> 05:40.980
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:41.280 --> 05:44.141
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:44.181 --> 05:46.162
BAU BAU!

05:47.963 --> 05:52.665
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:52.685 --> 05:53.345
Yeah!

05:53.525 --> 05:55.626
Ruffians, don't make that face!

05:56.446 --> 05:57.487
Don't make that face!

05:58.661 --> 06:00.603
Right now!

06:01.224 --> 06:02.185
BAU BAU!

06:02.526 --> 06:06.330
Thank you for joining us today for our 63rd episode!

06:06.730 --> 06:12.197
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

06:12.317 --> 06:15.460
Even though it's our 63rd episode, we still make mistakes, huh?

06:17.062 --> 06:17.742
That's just life.

06:17.903 --> 06:25.347
I was gonna say, I would hope, you know, maybe there's one or two Ruffians out there that maybe this is your first time watching FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:25.367 --> 06:25.567
I'm sorry.

06:25.588 --> 06:29.730
If this is your first time, I am sorry from the bottom of my heart!

06:29.750 --> 06:42.799
I was gonna say, if it is your first time, well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:43.219 --> 06:43.559
A.K.A.

06:43.759 --> 06:44.960
FUWAMOCO!

06:45.020 --> 06:46.181
And it's hosted by us!

06:46.721 --> 06:48.102
FUWAMOCO!

06:48.162 --> 06:49.342
BAU BAU!

06:49.722 --> 06:55.424
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:55.444 --> 06:57.545
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.726
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:01.106 --> 07:05.087
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:05.107 --> 07:07.508
BAU BAU!

07:07.608 --> 07:08.688
It's your first time.

07:09.809 --> 07:10.549
Apologies.

07:11.669 --> 07:13.270
BAU BAU.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.070
Well.

07:19.292 --> 07:21.414
Even for Ruffians, it's not your first time.

07:22.716 --> 07:24.778
We have some sad news.

07:26.861 --> 07:29.924
There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:32.847 --> 07:34.389
Where was he spotted this time?

07:35.170 --> 07:35.630
Let's see.

07:38.333 --> 07:38.453
Oh!

07:41.836 --> 07:48.460
Uh, that would be a very nice view if it wasn't for that, uh, nasty blob out there.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.501
Yeah!

07:49.801 --> 07:51.062
Some interesting weather.

07:51.082 --> 07:51.162
Yeah.

07:51.622 --> 07:53.403
Uh, Pero, what are you doing?

07:53.423 --> 08:01.668
Uh, why is he making a, uh, angry, silly, passionate face like that out there, huh?

08:02.668 --> 08:08.812
Maybe... Does he feel left out that you're gonna go visit family without him?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.076
Pero.

08:13.156 --> 08:15.477
You're not a part of this Ruffians family, okay?

08:15.777 --> 08:20.938
But... Maybe he just wants to spend the holidays together with someone.

08:21.838 --> 08:22.659
Oh, true.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.500
I guess, you know, he didn't really get that this year, huh?

08:28.020 --> 08:33.521
In a way, we usually spend it all together in the cell and everything, right?

08:33.561 --> 08:36.942
You know, this year, we've been a bit busy.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.462
A bit busy, yeah.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.203
Ruffians, what do you think?

08:41.957 --> 08:45.958
Would you want Pero to be more of a part of our holidays in the future?

08:46.018 --> 08:46.839
He's really big.

08:47.599 --> 08:49.439
Would that be okay?

08:50.540 --> 08:54.561
Pero and us and you.

08:56.402 --> 08:56.842
Yeah.

08:57.582 --> 08:57.822
No.

08:57.842 --> 08:58.042
No?

08:58.122 --> 08:58.262
No.

08:58.322 --> 08:59.543
He should stay out.

08:59.583 --> 09:00.463
Valentine's Day too?

09:00.503 --> 09:00.943
Valentine's!

09:01.003 --> 09:02.243
He should stay out.

09:03.504 --> 09:04.544
Valentine's!

09:07.165 --> 09:08.005
You wouldn't mind.

09:08.045 --> 09:10.446
You want him to sing for karaoke parties?

09:12.031 --> 09:12.952
You'd rather not, no?

09:13.552 --> 09:13.773
Why?

09:13.873 --> 09:14.473
Why?

09:14.633 --> 09:14.954
Why?

09:15.054 --> 09:16.055
I know, right?

09:16.655 --> 09:18.136
Yes, let him in.

09:19.337 --> 09:20.378
Maybe not Valentine's.

09:21.159 --> 09:22.600
Maybe not Valentine's.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.282
Valentine's with Pero would be nice.

09:26.364 --> 09:28.706
I am questioning your decisions, Ruffians.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.547
That's pretty nice, Ruffians.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.312
Well, he is very nasty.

09:36.693 --> 09:36.993
Maybe...

09:38.268 --> 09:39.709
We'll have to think about it.

09:39.749 --> 09:40.349
Maybe not.

09:40.369 --> 09:42.370
But the ruffians are gonna be nice, Mococo-chan.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.451
I think I've decided.

09:43.471 --> 09:44.411
BAU BAU!

09:44.872 --> 09:48.754
BAU BAU!

09:48.954 --> 09:53.937
That's quite a sight to see while on the travels, you know?

09:54.257 --> 09:57.779
Well, we have some... Some what?

09:57.879 --> 09:58.279
Fun?

09:58.319 --> 09:58.639
Good?

09:59.220 --> 09:59.800
Some news!

09:59.860 --> 10:00.180
News!

10:01.321 --> 10:02.701
Some news?

10:02.741 --> 10:04.723
To see ruffians!

10:07.745 --> 10:12.998
There was something super exciting happen at the start of the year, right?

10:13.399 --> 10:14.121
Right!

10:15.757 --> 10:18.658
Our New Year Outfit Reveal!

10:18.759 --> 10:21.320
BAU BAU!

10:21.600 --> 10:23.620
They were supposed to happen on the first, right?

10:24.261 --> 10:25.761
But they got postponed, huh?

10:26.101 --> 10:29.803
But Ruffians, don't get too excited.

10:30.143 --> 10:36.886
We want to still keep it in the front of your mind because we're hoping to have an update to you about it soon.

10:36.946 --> 10:38.146
Soon, okay?

10:38.406 --> 10:39.167
Soon!

10:39.387 --> 10:44.589
Don't think that you can just take it easy and take a big breath of relief, okay, Ruffians?

10:45.149 --> 10:51.911
Because you know, if you do so, you'll regret it when it comes to outfit reveals, okay?

10:52.091 --> 10:53.412
Yeah, I know.

10:54.032 --> 10:58.233
I want you to make sure, Ruffians, that you're going to make it still when you see them.

10:59.413 --> 10:59.913
Very cute.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.274
Very cute.

11:02.294 --> 11:07.036
So please make sure that you look forward to all of Alphys' New Year outfits, okay?

11:07.056 --> 11:08.156
You can breathe for now.

11:08.176 --> 11:11.177
But we'll see.

11:13.027 --> 11:16.353
BAU BAU!

11:16.373 --> 11:19.780
There's been some more!

11:20.768 --> 11:22.748
Happy New Year things.

11:22.808 --> 11:28.710
Well, you know, this past weekend in Japan was Comike.

11:29.290 --> 11:33.511
The biggest fan event in Japan.

11:34.471 --> 11:41.693
And our Icomochi-mama was showing her first unofficial FUWAMOCO fanbook!

11:44.437 --> 11:45.738
Really special.

11:45.758 --> 11:56.085
You know there's a cute illustration book, acrylic stand, a blanket, and even these two cute FUWAMOCO guys!

11:56.145 --> 11:59.728
They're there to hand out books and BAU BAU at you.

11:59.828 --> 12:03.150
BAU BAU, the BAU BAUs are free.

12:03.230 --> 12:08.834
Thank you so much to the Mashiro Sisters for helping Icomochi-mama with their booth.

12:10.111 --> 12:11.512
You know what, Ruffians?

12:12.152 --> 12:17.416
Thanks to everyone's enthusiasm, everything sold out there at the venue!

12:17.616 --> 12:19.457
BAU BAU!

12:19.537 --> 12:24.401
Icomochi-mama even did an extra print run of the books to sell online!

12:25.081 --> 12:27.643
And even those sold out very, very quickly!

12:27.683 --> 12:29.864
Congratulations, Icomochi-mama!

12:30.885 --> 12:32.585
We're so happy!

12:32.725 --> 12:34.166
BAU BAU!

12:34.206 --> 12:38.467
We hope that there will be even more FUWAMOCO Doujinshi in the future.

12:55.143 --> 12:56.744
Update on our side.

12:57.464 --> 13:01.466
Yes, Mane-chan was able to get us our goods.

13:02.106 --> 13:07.288
We're looking forward to them!

13:07.408 --> 13:09.609
BAU BAU!

13:09.649 --> 13:09.949
BAU BAU!

13:11.910 --> 13:12.951
Good news, hai.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.371
Good news.

13:15.291 --> 13:20.094
We also have more happy news.

13:21.789 --> 13:28.394
I know we mentioned it earlier before the New Year, but we saw something amazing made by the Ruffians.

13:29.514 --> 13:33.277
Message music for the New Year!

13:33.437 --> 13:35.418
BAU BAU!

13:35.658 --> 13:40.542
Ruffians, you worked all together to make it!

13:40.622 --> 13:42.083
We're so happy!

13:42.103 --> 13:44.244
We wanted to take our time to look over it well.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.386
So it took us a bit of time.

13:47.986 --> 13:51.628
Yeah, it has a bunch of heartwarming messages on it.

13:51.968 --> 13:55.230
New Year's Resolutions from so many Ruffians!

13:55.550 --> 13:58.911
Some of them, very, very good resolutions.

14:00.192 --> 14:00.692
Some of them.

14:03.553 --> 14:04.154
Some of them.

14:07.575 --> 14:11.217
I don't know if I can agree with them as much as some others, but

14:14.901 --> 14:17.884
All I can say is, good luck!

14:20.927 --> 14:26.372
You know, the music and the art, everything is so great!

14:26.572 --> 14:29.815
I was listening to the music the whole time!

14:30.416 --> 14:31.677
Please check it out, Ruffians!

14:31.697 --> 14:35.460
You can find it at FUWAMOCONEWYEARS.DE!

14:36.361 --> 14:37.322
If you have a moment...

14:39.781 --> 14:40.341
Ruffians!

14:40.941 --> 14:46.143
Let's work hard all together to make ourselves stronger and grow even more in 2024.

14:46.183 --> 14:46.483
Got it!

14:46.503 --> 14:46.903
Got it!

BAU

15:09.813 --> 15:14.135
Well, it has been a little while since we last did something like this.

15:14.175 --> 15:15.156
It's been busy.

15:15.176 --> 15:17.277
Yeah, it's not because we forgot.

15:17.597 --> 15:22.819
No, just like Moco-chan said, it's because it's been especially busy recently.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.360
But you know what?

15:24.680 --> 15:25.741
It's a new year!

15:26.101 --> 15:28.222
And so we thought we'd bring it back!

15:28.963 --> 15:29.103
So!

15:30.222 --> 15:41.792
This Thursday at 8pm PT or 1pm JST, we're going to be holding another Morning Response on Twitter!

15:41.812 --> 15:46.276
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

15:46.336 --> 15:46.877
It's on at...

15:47.137 --> 15:50.721
Thursday the 4th at 8pm ET.

15:51.101 --> 15:55.786
If you're not sure what a RR and response is, it's very simple.

15:56.527 --> 16:01.351
For a certain period of time, we'll do our all to respond to your tweets.

16:02.272 --> 16:09.760
We can't respond to every Ruffian's tweets, but we'll do everything we can to respond to as many as we can.

16:11.041 --> 16:21.703
We'll put out a tweet about the wrong response, and if you respond to that and use the hashtag FUWAMOCO in your tweet, we'll do our best to respond!

16:22.063 --> 16:31.005
Yeah, you know, which ruffians we respond to is always completely random, but we do hope that we'll be able to send you a tweet back.

16:31.385 --> 16:34.846
Yeah, we'll be doing it for an hour and a half until 9.30pm PT.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.562
Are you excited, Ruffians?

16:42.385 --> 16:42.885
BAU BAU!

16:42.945 --> 16:44.126
What is a Twitter?

16:44.547 --> 16:45.568
What is a Twitter?

16:45.648 --> 16:47.590
A Twitter is a Twitter and a Twitter is a tweet.

16:47.830 --> 16:48.771
It's a little boring.

16:48.791 --> 16:48.892
Yeah.

16:51.124 --> 16:51.324
BAU BAU!

17:13.030 --> 17:15.173
BAU BAU!

17:15.213 --> 17:19.578
There's some more interesting news going on!

17:28.267 --> 17:30.128
There was something announced the other day.

17:30.148 --> 17:38.291
Together in partnership with Capsule, there's going to be a new hololive collab cafe happening in Taiwan City!

17:38.391 --> 17:40.511
BAU BAU!

17:41.212 --> 17:43.432
It's CHEER UP Cafe!

17:44.453 --> 17:55.876
From January 27th to February 4th, you can see Subaru-senpai, and Pekora-senpai, Kobo-senpai, Kaira-senpai, Kura-senpai, and Alvin's Biboo!

17:55.916 --> 17:56.497
Biboo!

17:57.637 --> 18:04.743
Wearing these super super duper cute cheer outfits and get themed food and all that fun stuff.

18:05.244 --> 18:08.727
Why, it looks super cute and colorful!

18:08.987 --> 18:13.531
You know, Biboo looks extra cute in her cheer outfit too.

18:13.551 --> 18:18.475
You know, I would like to wear this super cute cheer outfit too.

18:18.775 --> 18:19.336
Huh?

18:19.376 --> 18:21.598
Moco-chan, you feeling a little envious?

18:22.638 --> 18:22.779
No.

18:24.079 --> 18:26.429
Don't you think you'll be good for Pup Talk soon?

18:26.449 --> 18:26.851
Huh?

18:30.648 --> 18:34.449
Yeah, whatever Mococo, hi.

18:34.509 --> 18:38.490
But you know Biboo, she looks so happy and sparkly.

18:38.730 --> 18:40.810
And she has the little biboo biboo biboo.

18:41.610 --> 18:42.131
Right.

18:42.591 --> 18:47.612
Yeah, Pebbles definitely won't want to miss out on the merch from the collab cafe.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.092
Make sure you mark it in your calendar, okay?

18:50.272 --> 18:53.233
Yeah, and maybe share with FUWAMOCO too.

18:55.377 --> 18:57.518
Wait, I want words too!

18:58.019 --> 18:59.359
It's so cute!

18:59.960 --> 19:00.740
Not fair.

19:01.340 --> 19:01.981
Not fair.

19:02.181 --> 19:02.821
BAU BAU!

19:02.921 --> 19:06.063
I'm happy.

19:06.123 --> 19:07.263
It cheered you up already?

19:07.283 --> 19:07.343
Yes.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.625
It hasn't even started yet.

19:11.665 --> 19:11.926
Yes.

19:12.066 --> 19:12.346
BAU BAU!

19:12.426 --> 19:13.646
Ruffians.

19:22.345 --> 19:25.007
Um... I have something to say.

19:25.027 --> 19:27.588
Is it a Pup Talk?

19:28.349 --> 19:28.649
No.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.430
I have a confession to make.

19:32.731 --> 19:35.393
Hehehe... Yeah.

19:36.252 --> 19:37.052
Ruffians!

19:37.473 --> 19:39.393
So, you know, right?

19:39.634 --> 19:44.876
Usually, I'll tweet about our next upcoming stream right before I go to bed, right?

19:46.156 --> 19:50.598
And a lot of times, by that point, Moco-chan is long past that.

19:50.638 --> 19:53.680
Not a lot of times, just last night.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.561
I don't know.

19:55.581 --> 19:56.661
Just last night.

19:59.162 --> 20:04.044
So, I did my best all on my own, but sometimes, you know,

20:05.936 --> 20:11.909
I write to stay awake and you know, I have to write the tweet in a way that doesn't sound like in the vlog!

20:12.430 --> 20:14.434
I'm half awake when writing it.

20:17.704 --> 20:26.473
Yesterday's FUWAMOCO Morning Tweet, it was particularly rough.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.754
The tweet for today.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.978
Don't go and analyze it, okay, Ruffians?

20:33.300 --> 20:38.685
As I was writing it, I kept on falling asleep and forgetting what I was going to write.

20:40.554 --> 20:45.135
You know, it was strange because I kept on hearing Nerissa laughing.

20:46.656 --> 20:48.376
I wake up to her laughing.

20:48.396 --> 20:48.476
What?

20:53.017 --> 20:57.018
You know, Nerissa being like... What?

20:57.698 --> 20:58.459
That sound like her?

20:58.519 --> 20:59.319
Don't look at me.

20:59.339 --> 21:03.500
Do you know what I mean, Ruffians?

21:07.263 --> 21:16.128
I don't know why, but every time I hear her laughing, I wake up, I write a little more of the tweet, then I fall asleep.

21:16.789 --> 21:21.612
Then I hear Nerissa and repeat and repeat and repeat until I finally finish the tweet.

21:22.452 --> 21:23.653
And then I fell asleep for good.

21:26.084 --> 21:26.604
It was weird.

21:27.005 --> 21:27.465
I don't know.

21:27.485 --> 21:28.045
That's good.

21:28.065 --> 21:29.206
I wonder why.

21:29.346 --> 21:31.687
It went down in the end, so that's good.

21:32.088 --> 21:33.088
Wait, am I okay?

21:33.208 --> 21:33.829
Am I okay?

21:33.949 --> 21:34.669
I don't know.

21:34.689 --> 21:36.210
I don't know.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.772
Just, Norris is not leaving my brain, huh?

21:41.253 --> 21:42.014
I don't know.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.154
Whatever, Mococo.

21:43.895 --> 21:44.155
Huh?

21:44.215 --> 21:45.596
What do you mean, Moco-chan?

21:45.616 --> 21:48.918
Why is Norris in your brain so much, huh?

21:51.038 --> 21:53.359
Is it because you keep on DMing or what?

21:53.719 --> 21:55.580
We're talking about girl stuff, right?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.101
I don't know, Ruffians.

21:58.121 --> 22:00.702
Maybe this is a sign not to tweet right before bed.

22:00.722 --> 22:06.524
Oops.

22:06.964 --> 22:10.025
BAU BAU!

22:10.586 --> 22:11.326
It was weird.

22:11.366 --> 22:13.387
I just kept on hearing the wrists laughing.

22:13.907 --> 22:15.608
I wonder what she was laughing about.

22:18.549 --> 22:19.069
That's weird.

22:20.427 --> 22:24.389
Weird things happening from the very beginning of the year, huh?

22:27.931 --> 22:33.955
Well... I thought maybe... I'd say something.

22:34.035 --> 22:34.695
But is it okay?

22:34.735 --> 22:35.856
Because it's not weird.

22:35.876 --> 22:39.458
Do you still want to hear it if it's not weird, Ruffians?

22:39.498 --> 22:40.858
I don't know, Moco-chan.

22:40.979 --> 22:43.040
I don't see any cheer output from you.

22:48.110 --> 22:52.834
I'm making a sour face.

22:52.894 --> 22:54.155
I want a Doggie of the Day.

22:54.175 --> 22:56.817
Oh, the Doggie of the Day!

22:56.837 --> 23:01.581
Doggie of the Day is not Moco-chan!

23:02.642 --> 23:03.783
It's never me.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.846
No, Moco-chan, the Doggie of the Day isn't supposed to be us.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.409
You want a pup talk?

23:13.314 --> 23:15.976
I think, Moco-chan, we need a pup talk.

23:16.236 --> 23:19.358
The year's beginning and maybe it's a little rough.

23:20.979 --> 23:21.399
Well!

23:24.661 --> 23:25.822
RUFFIANS!

23:27.823 --> 23:29.224
I have something to tell you.

23:29.244 --> 23:31.626
And, you know what?

23:32.986 --> 23:36.289
You're gonna want to listen to what I have to say, okay?

23:37.389 --> 23:38.210
You know what this is.

23:38.810 --> 23:41.172
You should know, cause I already said what it is.

23:42.225 --> 23:45.786
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

23:46.567 --> 23:48.788
And you're gonna hear straight from me.

23:49.088 --> 23:50.268
Mococo!

23:52.549 --> 23:52.829
You.

23:53.749 --> 23:54.650
Ruffian!

23:54.670 --> 23:56.771
Did you know?

23:58.111 --> 24:01.132
It's officially 2024!

24:01.692 --> 24:02.793
It's the new year!

24:02.813 --> 24:05.674
Can you believe it?

24:07.267 --> 24:11.710
Somehow, you know, we all get to live in the same time together!

24:13.111 --> 24:15.093
It's sort of amazing when you think about it, huh?

24:16.774 --> 24:17.074
Well!

24:17.955 --> 24:20.737
Have you been thinking about your New Year resolution?

24:21.777 --> 24:25.020
You know, I know a lot of you have one or two.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.203
And some of you, you have many!

24:29.243 --> 24:30.563
And you know what?

24:31.424 --> 24:32.145
That's great!

24:33.506 --> 24:36.608
But... The most important thing is...

24:37.995 --> 24:41.176
You know, just continue at your New Year's resolution.

24:42.376 --> 24:51.739
I think it's easy to get down and be hard on yourself when maybe a week goes by and you realize, oh, I wasn't able to work on my goal at all!

24:51.759 --> 24:55.740
So, don't beat yourself up over those sort of things, okay?

24:56.320 --> 24:57.480
It happens to all of us!

24:58.300 --> 25:03.642
Sometimes you're busy, you're tired, you can't balance it all all the time.

25:04.437 --> 25:08.322
Even one step forward a week is 50 steps a year!

25:09.664 --> 25:11.547
You'll get somewhere better than before, okay?

25:12.268 --> 25:15.252
The most important thing is to just continue at it!

25:16.769 --> 25:19.810
Because if you stop and you give up, it's over.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.431
Nothing will change.

25:22.431 --> 25:28.273
And I know change can be scary, but sometimes no change is even more frightening.

25:29.654 --> 25:30.514
I know you can do it.

25:30.894 --> 25:31.935
Just pace yourself.

25:32.695 --> 25:33.255
And you know what?

25:34.115 --> 25:36.036
I'll be here to have your back, okay?

25:36.056 --> 25:37.897
We can do it all together!

25:37.917 --> 25:38.597
Ganbatte de!

25:39.017 --> 25:39.597
BAU BAU!

25:39.638 --> 25:40.738
BAU BAU!

25:47.579 --> 25:54.546
Let's do our best once again, FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

25:54.566 --> 25:55.667
BAU BAU!

25:56.428 --> 26:01.072
Next, we have our Doggie of the Day!

26:01.092 --> 26:05.917
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Haru!

26:05.937 --> 26:06.958
BAU BAU!

26:08.787 --> 26:11.489
Very dressed up, huh?

26:12.069 --> 26:14.410
Haru's a cutie!

26:14.891 --> 26:20.374
You know, I'm not a dragon, I'm a chihuahua!

26:20.454 --> 26:24.036
I'm not a dragon, I'm a chihuahua!

26:24.256 --> 26:25.317
Cute!

26:25.797 --> 26:32.401
Well, Haru has an appetite like a dragon, but only weighs 5 kg.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.641
Tiny dragon.

26:35.024 --> 26:37.348
Yeah, he's not a fan of walks either.

26:38.029 --> 26:41.333
He likes to get babied and be carried around too.

26:41.353 --> 26:42.996
Maybe sometimes.

26:43.356 --> 26:44.758
Moco-chan you like that!

26:46.365 --> 26:47.705
Princess Kyori is mine.

26:48.826 --> 26:50.626
You'll do the same thing as Haru though.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.827
Get carried halfway and then walk away home.

26:53.007 --> 26:54.548
I'm a princess!

26:55.108 --> 26:57.248
I'm Mococo!

26:57.829 --> 26:58.189
BAU BAU!

26:58.569 --> 27:00.810
How does Haru BAU BAU?

27:01.290 --> 27:03.290
Like a tiny dragon.

27:03.550 --> 27:06.271
You have to imagine you sort of spit fire a bit.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.192
BAU BAU!

27:09.209 --> 27:11.911
Tiny Fireball.

27:13.131 --> 27:16.754
Sounds like a ray gun.

27:17.494 --> 27:18.915
That's basically what Haru is.

27:19.355 --> 27:21.096
Haru is basically a ray gun.

27:21.837 --> 27:23.278
A baby ray gun.

27:23.738 --> 27:32.023
As you can all see, Haru is very excited about the new year.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.565
The year of the dragon.

27:35.085 --> 27:36.386
Even if Haru is tiny,

27:37.086 --> 27:38.367
There's a dragon inside!

27:38.628 --> 27:40.369
Inside the heart!

27:40.690 --> 27:44.113
And outside the heart!

27:44.514 --> 27:53.342
Haru's New Year's resolution is to eat lots of yummy food and also get lots of cuddles from his special ruffians.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.183
That sounds nice.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.345
BAU BAU!

27:56.385 --> 27:56.546
Bye!

27:56.606 --> 27:57.426
BAU BAU!

27:59.787 --> 28:01.187
Very cute.

28:02.928 --> 28:04.648
Haru's just like a dragon.

28:06.729 --> 28:09.170
What kind of walk so Ruffians have been going on?

28:09.330 --> 28:11.370
Today's walk is... De-den!

28:11.510 --> 28:14.551
Pretty!

28:14.571 --> 28:15.691
What a snowy.

28:15.731 --> 28:18.492
Was this the first time you got to see the snow this year?

28:18.732 --> 28:19.573
It is a new year.

28:19.613 --> 28:22.433
Not the first time ever, was it?

28:22.453 --> 28:23.574
Just the first time this year.

28:23.654 --> 28:27.895
You know, the snow on the ground and the clear blue skies.

28:28.922 --> 28:30.963
Nothing really beats a high.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.703
Except for the sun.

28:32.763 --> 28:36.704
And the snowman there!

28:36.764 --> 28:37.685
Super cute.

28:37.725 --> 28:39.225
Very cute.

28:39.245 --> 28:39.725
Good job.

28:40.225 --> 28:42.966
We're glad you had an awesome hike!

28:43.106 --> 28:44.847
BAU BAU!

28:46.169 --> 28:49.550
Up next, our Question of the Day.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.411
We have De-den!

28:52.431 --> 28:53.612
FUWAMOCO!

28:54.012 --> 28:55.272
I have a question.

28:55.312 --> 28:57.253
BAU BAU!

28:57.433 --> 29:06.256
During your walk in my streams, do you hold back an explicit urge to return to your native tongue every lyric into a BAU BAU?

29:07.916 --> 29:08.937
This is a good question.

29:09.037 --> 29:12.238
I could feel that urge coming from my side.

29:12.278 --> 29:13.979
You could tell.

29:19.106 --> 29:21.047
How did you know it is?

29:21.347 --> 29:23.108
But, but, but, we can't.

29:23.848 --> 29:32.171
Because, you know, it'd be a little rude to the creators who work very hard to make meaningful lyrics in English or Japanese.

29:32.211 --> 29:33.572
It's their lyrics, you know.

29:34.132 --> 29:38.414
Although, you know, we sing them with a lot of heart when we say BAU BAU instead.

29:38.954 --> 29:39.174
But...

29:43.530 --> 29:44.510
Maybe just sometimes.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.472
Yeah, but we do sometimes.

29:46.492 --> 29:49.354
Here and there, you know, when we can.

29:49.775 --> 29:50.875
But not too much.

29:51.016 --> 29:51.936
Not too much.

29:51.996 --> 29:53.798
We pull ourselves back, okay?

29:55.199 --> 29:57.300
BAU BAU!

29:57.841 --> 29:59.122
Thank you, Ruffians!

29:59.142 --> 30:03.685
Thank you so much for all your Doggie of the Day questions!

30:03.725 --> 30:05.647
Such good questions, always.

30:05.687 --> 30:06.548
Your walks and...

30:07.308 --> 30:08.628
Pero Sightings too.

30:09.108 --> 30:13.769
And also, especially the friend, FUWAMOCO Scoop.

30:13.789 --> 30:16.190
It's really been helping us a lot.

30:16.210 --> 30:19.070
Thank you for your great journalism, Ruffians!

30:19.671 --> 30:28.772
And please don't forget to use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING and hashtag FWMCScoop for your scoops!

30:28.892 --> 30:30.893
BAU BAU!

30:31.313 --> 30:33.673
And as for our next stream!

30:34.273 --> 30:36.194
Well, today we're playing...

30:37.245 --> 30:38.786
Super Mario Bros.

30:38.906 --> 30:41.067
Live!

30:41.427 --> 30:44.788
And the last time we were playing, it got pretty intense.

30:45.569 --> 30:50.231
Yeah, but today, you know, we're gonna do our best to play nicely as a team together.

30:50.251 --> 30:50.411
Yeah!

30:54.039 --> 30:59.204
We'll do our best, okay?

30:59.604 --> 31:01.386
BAU BAU!

31:01.987 --> 31:07.231
And if we take another peek at our schedule, here we are!

31:07.652 --> 31:14.078
Well, Thursday is going to be a little bit of a homework day for us, but we also have a ramen response, so please

31:16.379 --> 31:26.845
As for the rest of our schedule, you might know there might be some more changes coming up, so please do keep an eye on our Twitter and YouTube community page.

31:27.506 --> 31:32.109
But one thing that won't be changing for sure is the holocaust.

31:32.209 --> 31:34.050
The Big Mario Kart Tenement.

31:35.091 --> 31:38.194
We're gonna do our best, okay, Ruffians?

31:38.214 --> 31:40.137
Please cheer for us.

31:40.177 --> 31:43.921
BAU BAU!

31:44.442 --> 31:51.871
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for another episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:52.552 --> 31:59.638
Before we say BAU BAU, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
