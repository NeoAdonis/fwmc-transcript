BAU BAU!

06:41.821 --> 06:42.501
I ain't done!

06:42.561 --> 06:44.222
A different doggy froggy maybe?

06:44.302 --> 06:45.482
A doggy frog year!

06:45.542 --> 06:47.943
I ain't doggy frog year!

06:48.183 --> 06:48.704
Yeah.

06:51.605 --> 06:52.345
Compare it.

06:53.185 --> 06:53.665
Today!

06:53.685 --> 06:54.105
Howl!

06:59.505 --> 07:00.847
It's a little foggy.

07:00.867 --> 07:03.449
Well, it's a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:03.509 --> 07:09.154
And unfortunately... There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:22.745 --> 07:23.905
Well, let's see.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.546
Let's take a look.

07:26.886 --> 07:27.827
Hope for the best.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.447
De-den!

07:30.167 --> 07:36.449
At the airport!

07:36.809 --> 07:41.151
Pero, he is awfully happy to be there at the airport with you!

07:42.631 --> 07:43.391
Sharing a chair.

07:43.411 --> 07:44.452
Oh, like, nice.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.932
He's having a nice conversation together.

07:50.436 --> 07:51.980
Yeah, I don't know, Ruffians.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.025
Something's a little bit funny here.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.210
But those puppy eyes too!

07:56.330 --> 07:59.237
Yeah, you're being too nice to him, huh?

07:59.778 --> 08:00.058
You know.

08:00.964 --> 08:07.646
I can tell that he can use you, you know, this Ruffian to the advantage, right?

08:07.946 --> 08:10.167
Yeah, make sure you're careful, okay?

08:10.207 --> 08:10.727
Careful!

08:10.767 --> 08:16.669
We told you lots and lots of Ruffians, but yet, when you see Pero, you're still getting pretty close to him.

08:16.689 --> 08:18.450
You have to stay away.

08:18.470 --> 08:21.491
Yeah, but you took him to Singapore with you!

08:21.551 --> 08:22.011
Why?

08:22.191 --> 08:23.832
Hopefully he's not up to...

08:24.392 --> 08:24.572
BAU!

08:40.302 --> 08:45.105
Maybe we have a peril whisperer or something.

08:45.826 --> 08:51.049
We hope you had an amazing time at G-House 3.

08:51.089 --> 08:53.850
It sounds like it was the concert of a lifetime.

08:53.870 --> 08:57.652
I want to check it out live!

08:57.832 --> 08:59.753
BAU BAU!

09:02.295 --> 09:06.438
You sound like one of the creatures you find in Australia, no?

09:25.458 --> 09:27.462
BAU BAU!

09:27.562 --> 09:28.745
BAU BAU!

09:28.825 --> 09:30.909
BAU BAU Ruffians!

09:31.490 --> 09:34.917
There has been so many amazing things going on that I...

09:37.739 --> 09:46.164
FUWAMOCO, uh, we feel a little bit bad because we're a bit behind on reporting them to you here on FUWAMOCO Morning.

09:46.184 --> 09:46.284
Right.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.646
Well, we can't keep up.

09:48.786 --> 09:50.007
We'll catch up now.

09:50.027 --> 09:50.647
Yeah.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.910
Well, whole album's demono sound Nerissa waving claws!

09:56.351 --> 10:01.414
She just released her first original song, Say My Name!

10:01.554 --> 10:02.895
BAU BAU BAU!

10:03.075 --> 10:04.076
Nerissa!

10:04.156 --> 10:05.016
Nerissa!

10:05.256 --> 10:05.797
Nerissa!

10:08.398 --> 10:12.381
Nerissa K. Yeah, Nerissa K. N-E-R-I-S-S-A.

10:12.441 --> 10:12.821
K. No!

10:13.241 --> 10:18.305
Nerissa K. BAU!

10:18.485 --> 10:20.066
It's so amazing!

10:21.186 --> 10:24.669
This sounds so good!

10:25.109 --> 10:28.711
It's so disco-y and swanky and snazzy.

10:29.111 --> 10:31.233
It just really captures everything that makes up

10:31.793 --> 10:35.276
Nerissa waiting for time.

10:35.356 --> 10:39.560
Not just the song though, the video is so beautiful too.

10:39.600 --> 10:48.207
It's an alluring animation of Nerissa dancing and slaying.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.143
Not just once.

10:51.183 --> 10:51.743
Not just twice.

10:51.783 --> 10:52.985
Not just three times.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.526
Not just four times.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.139
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:07.279 --> 11:09.700
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.782
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.943
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:14.963 --> 11:16.364
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:16.444 --> 11:18.665
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:18.685 --> 11:19.846
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:19.926 --> 11:21.747
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.808
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:23.828 --> 11:25.909
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:25.929 --> 11:28.010
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamoco-chan.

11:28.070 --> 11:30.212
I'm not just Faitan, I'm not just Fuwamo

11:33.604 --> 11:35.325
Listen to it lots again!

11:35.865 --> 11:36.925
And Nerissa!

11:37.245 --> 11:40.687
Congratulations on your first original song!

11:40.747 --> 11:42.687
BAU BAU!

11:43.728 --> 11:48.729
And also, Nerissa hit a big milestone on YouTube too!

11:50.350 --> 11:54.011
Nerissa hit a milestone that she wanted to reach of 669,000 subscribers!

11:59.511 --> 11:59.931
Wow!

11:59.951 --> 12:01.292
And she did it!

12:01.672 --> 12:02.472
BAU BAU!

12:02.532 --> 12:04.573
Well done, Nerissa!

12:04.633 --> 12:05.973
Congratulations!

12:05.993 --> 12:08.934
Let's continue to all do our best together, okay?

12:09.014 --> 12:09.214
Yeah!

12:09.635 --> 12:11.175
Advent strong!

12:12.035 --> 12:14.336
Advent strong!

12:14.356 --> 12:14.676
BAU BAU!

12:14.696 --> 12:15.036
BAU BAU!

12:15.076 --> 12:15.257
Yay!

12:16.477 --> 12:20.819
I don't know, usually most like at 100 you celebrate it, right?

12:20.899 --> 12:22.839
Or like at the 50 you celebrate it, right?

12:22.859 --> 12:24.840
I guess the number wasn't pointing to her.

12:26.460 --> 12:33.123
I mean, 2-2-2 is special to us, right?

12:33.843 --> 12:43.627
But, speaking of Advent, not only has Nerissa had some especially cool things going on, but Advent are clever!

12:43.987 --> 12:49.249
Shiori Novella also has had a bunch of things going on too!

12:49.329 --> 12:52.350
Shiori also hit a huge milestone!

12:52.370 --> 12:53.491
She reached 500!

12:55.292 --> 12:56.633
10,000 subscribers on YouTube!

12:56.713 --> 12:57.714
BAU BAU!

12:58.254 --> 12:59.575
And not just that!

12:59.636 --> 13:03.999
This week is Shiori's birthday too!

13:04.120 --> 13:07.402
Her first birthday since her debut!

13:07.442 --> 13:09.544
Her birthday is on May 2nd!

13:10.585 --> 13:17.891
May 6th is not too far from now, and she'll be celebrating it together with the novelies and a big birthday party!

13:17.911 --> 13:18.692
Yeah, baths!

13:19.092 --> 13:19.993
Birthday baths!

13:20.253 --> 13:20.794
Birthday baths!

13:20.954 --> 13:24.317
It's not a birthday party, it's a birthday bath!

13:24.337 --> 13:25.778
I almost said birthday bath.

13:26.419 --> 13:28.120
Not a birthday bath!

13:28.140 --> 13:33.745
Yeah, there'll be so many fun activities and things that Shiori's been planning!

13:33.765 --> 13:34.285
Cake!

13:34.325 --> 13:34.986
Oh, cake!

13:35.286 --> 13:36.087
You think so?

13:36.687 --> 13:36.867
Shiori!

13:36.887 --> 13:37.848
Happy birthday!

13:38.009 --> 13:39.350
I do, I do, Shiori.

13:58.871 --> 14:02.493
BAU BAU!

14:02.533 --> 14:05.395
So many exciting advent anniversaries?

14:05.476 --> 14:06.396
Anniversaries?

14:06.616 --> 14:09.298
Advent... milestones?

14:09.579 --> 14:10.359
Advent times.

14:10.759 --> 14:13.141
Advent times, yeah.

14:14.042 --> 14:17.184
Oh, you mean this!

14:17.244 --> 14:18.605
Got it!

14:19.626 --> 14:22.668
Not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow!

14:23.449 --> 14:24.610
Not tomorrow, what?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.591
Not the day after tomorrow.

14:28.740 --> 14:31.122
BAU BAU!

14:31.162 --> 14:31.882
Ruffians!

14:32.163 --> 14:33.924
Oh, we're not late on this one.

14:34.064 --> 14:34.404
No.

14:34.844 --> 14:39.067
This is brand new information, so listen up, okay?

14:39.768 --> 14:40.048
Yeah.

14:40.068 --> 14:48.554
Just a few hours ago, a new voice pack was released, and FUWAMOCO will participate in it!

14:48.674 --> 14:49.374
BAU BAU!

14:49.434 --> 14:55.278
Yeah, it's the Mysterious Preschool Voice Pack!

14:55.578 --> 14:56.539
Yeah!

14:56.599 --> 14:57.420
Ruffians!

14:59.278 --> 14:59.618
FUWAMOCO!

14:59.659 --> 15:04.144
This time Moco-chan, you became a preschooler, and I became a preschool teacher!

15:18.274 --> 15:26.117
But some Ruffians might know, but I really couldn't stop laughing while we were doing the recording.

15:26.657 --> 15:27.297
Yeah.

15:27.857 --> 15:32.299
You know that day, I was super stuffed up.

15:32.359 --> 15:32.979
Yeah.

15:33.079 --> 15:34.160
So badly.

15:34.640 --> 15:39.481
My nose wouldn't stop running and I just couldn't stop sneezing the whole time.

15:39.582 --> 15:41.522
It's never been like that.

15:41.722 --> 15:42.743
It was really strange.

15:42.863 --> 15:43.343
Yeah.

15:44.178 --> 15:48.159
So, I really got into the role of the snotty little preschooler.

15:48.259 --> 15:49.599
Definitely, yeah.

15:50.020 --> 15:50.460
Yeah.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.821
So, Ruffians, if you listen closely, do you need to listen closely?

15:55.301 --> 16:00.782
If you take a listen, I think you can definitely tell just how stuffed up Moco-chan was.

16:03.783 --> 16:09.725
Well, you can enjoy both the worlds of taking care of a needy Moco-chan, tiny Moco-chan, and, uh,

16:11.625 --> 16:14.228
Also being babied.

16:14.268 --> 16:17.593
Babied by a big chihuahua.

16:17.613 --> 16:20.356
There's a voice back too.

16:20.376 --> 16:26.443
We've already been seeing how much you've been doing it, Ruffians.

16:26.463 --> 16:29.868
The Ruffians have been getting a little bit silly.

16:31.505 --> 16:32.005
10 out of 10!

16:32.065 --> 16:35.927
Thank you, Ruffians!

16:36.327 --> 16:36.887
Thank you!

16:36.927 --> 16:47.851
Like usual, we also recorded it in both English and Japanese, so please check them both out, and you can enjoy the little differences between the two, too.

16:48.092 --> 16:49.592
Yeah, you still have any quiet yet?

16:49.612 --> 16:51.013
Mada kattenai?

16:51.073 --> 16:53.334
Just get to sleep!

16:53.474 --> 16:54.154
Ima da yo!

16:54.794 --> 16:56.856
BAU BAU!

16:56.937 --> 16:58.418
Please check it out, okay?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.779
It was really fun.

16:59.799 --> 17:01.081
There's samples as well.

17:01.101 --> 17:05.265
Yeah, you can check out on the hololive official store, official shop.

17:05.685 --> 17:07.727
You can check out the voice pack samples.

17:07.747 --> 17:09.489
You can listen up to a minute.

17:09.549 --> 17:09.889
Right.

17:09.909 --> 17:11.731
So, please check it out, okay?

17:11.871 --> 17:13.133
It's a long sample, okay?

17:13.213 --> 17:15.235
Yeah, in both English and Japanese.

17:15.255 --> 17:16.336
BAU BAU!

17:21.611 --> 17:32.775
Well, yesterday was also a really big day for FUWAMOCO.

17:33.075 --> 17:41.638
Because, well, we had our first collab and off-collab with Mighty Senchou Senpai!

17:41.698 --> 17:42.218
BAU BAU!

17:43.865 --> 17:47.827
We were really nervous because of the off club.

17:48.247 --> 17:54.730
We got to go and barge into Morning in Senchou-senpai's place.

17:56.050 --> 18:03.273
And this time we played the classic game series Touhou's Mountain of Fate together.

18:03.573 --> 18:06.934
And Senchou-senpai taught us some very good strategies.

18:06.954 --> 18:07.795
She taught us

18:09.246 --> 18:10.867
Her pro skills.

18:11.427 --> 18:12.108
Yeah.

18:12.188 --> 18:22.434
And if you didn't know, Ruffians, Marine-senpai, she's known for just her amazing, amazing, not just, but her amazing professional.

18:22.454 --> 18:23.814
Yeah, her professional play.

18:27.278 --> 18:38.263
I know, it's really mesmerizing watching her, but I think her biggest shock though was the moment she pulled out a controller!

18:38.584 --> 18:42.245
Because we always thought that wasn't an option.

18:42.526 --> 18:43.226
Yeah!

18:43.266 --> 18:44.707
It was a keyboard game!

18:44.807 --> 18:47.748
Yeah, she plays on controller, not keyboard!

18:47.768 --> 18:54.852
You know, we thought that's the only way you could play Touhou, but on keyboard, that was the way to play it!

18:55.212 --> 18:55.412
Yeah!

18:56.089 --> 18:58.071
We still have a lot to learn, huh?

18:58.211 --> 18:58.731
Yeah.

19:00.433 --> 19:01.794
When did that happen?

19:02.275 --> 19:16.007
Yeah, but, you know, it was until we cleared the whole mountain of faith, but even though we had so much fun, we still weren't quite able to beat the game completely.

19:16.548 --> 19:18.830
The last boss gonna play the Ruffian.

19:20.091 --> 19:31.985
So, you know, FUWAMOCO, we'll just have to practice lots and lots so that Senchou-senpai will be proud of us and then maybe we can show her just how much we've improved too!

19:32.145 --> 19:32.466
Yeah!

19:32.546 --> 19:32.866
And, uh...

19:35.829 --> 19:43.034
It's a little bit embarrassing, but during our collab, I-I finally did it!

19:43.374 --> 19:47.797
I convinced Mari-senpai!

19:47.857 --> 19:50.598
That you know that she's my OC!

19:50.678 --> 19:54.561
You really like Mari-senpai, right?

19:54.821 --> 19:56.862
I like her too much.

19:56.882 --> 19:57.423
I know.

19:58.203 --> 20:02.349
I can't help it, she's so cute and cool and so talented and just...

20:11.343 --> 20:24.210
But hopefully you know, FUWAMOCO, maybe one day we can become an amazing member of hololive just like her someday too.

20:25.811 --> 20:34.656
But not only did we just play Touhou together, but we also had sukiyaki for dinner too!

20:34.676 --> 20:36.017
We didn't eat her food.

20:36.137 --> 20:36.217
No.

20:37.117 --> 20:39.838
We had dinner together!

20:39.978 --> 20:46.941
And you know, it was just so nice being able to chat and take it easy together.

20:47.401 --> 20:49.662
We chatted so much, oh my gosh.

20:49.702 --> 20:51.442
Time flew by fast.

20:51.562 --> 20:53.563
Oh my god, a little bit dangerous there.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.844
I lost track of time.

20:56.104 --> 20:58.345
But you know, during dinner,

21:00.293 --> 21:11.419
My nose wouldn't stop running, so I was trying to get out of my handkerchief, but Mighty-senpai gave me a tissue before I could find it!

21:11.459 --> 21:13.100
Tissue!

21:13.500 --> 21:20.884
But it was funny, because it smelled really good!

21:20.984 --> 21:23.566
It was almost like a...

21:25.390 --> 21:30.217
Dangerous Mining Smell.

21:30.257 --> 21:33.322
Moco-chan, why didn't you let me smell it too, huh?

21:33.682 --> 21:36.867
Because you have my snot in you.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.754
I don't know, it's kind of funny how things are like that, right?

21:44.615 --> 21:47.457
We just had such a good time together.

21:47.897 --> 21:53.661
We really hope that we can get to know my Senchou Senpai a lot more in the future too!

21:54.062 --> 21:56.043
BAU BAU!

21:56.123 --> 22:04.049
Yeah, I'm not gonna share the message that I sent Senchou Senpai afterwards.

22:04.649 --> 22:05.750
BAU BAU!

22:13.460 --> 22:15.040
Did Mococo keep the tissue?

22:15.080 --> 22:16.841
That's what I was asking!

22:17.082 --> 22:19.143
Moco-chan, do you still have the tissue?

22:19.203 --> 22:20.123
Is it in your bag?

22:20.183 --> 22:21.204
Can I smell it?

22:21.524 --> 22:23.125
It has my snot in it.

22:23.145 --> 22:25.546
Moco-chan, where is it, huh?

22:25.986 --> 22:26.687
Threw it out.

22:27.147 --> 22:28.168
Why?

22:29.288 --> 22:30.109
Why?

22:30.569 --> 22:34.731
Well, technically, it's at the restaurant.

22:35.071 --> 22:35.872
In their garbage.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.939
So they have it, huh?

22:40.979 --> 22:41.639
They have it.

22:41.759 --> 22:43.459
I think it's probably gone now, huh?

22:44.660 --> 22:45.500
BAU BAU.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.480
BAU BAU!

22:47.301 --> 22:49.261
Well, also, Ruffians!

22:49.601 --> 22:58.984
You know, with this week being the big roll that we call it is in Japan, FUWAMOCO, we've been doing a bunch of JP's twos!

22:59.525 --> 23:06.067
And special collabs with our JP-senpai, like Koyori-senpai, and Marine-senchou-senpai, so fun!

23:06.427 --> 23:06.827
But...

23:07.850 --> 23:10.792
You might have noticed something new too.

23:11.392 --> 23:12.212
Ruffians!

23:13.993 --> 23:23.358
Well, you know, we had to peddle down and ask him if he could help us out with something important.

23:24.159 --> 23:24.919
Oh well.

23:28.148 --> 23:28.388
Oi!

23:29.789 --> 23:29.969
Oi!

23:30.349 --> 23:31.470
Did you notice?

23:31.990 --> 23:45.595
Yo, FUWAMOCO, you know, we know there's a number of Ruffians who are still just starting the Japanese language journey and that you really, really want to enjoy our streams and Japanese live together with us too!

23:45.755 --> 23:55.479
So, FUWAMOCO, we begged and begged Pero to help us by doing some live translating from Japanese to English during our streams!

23:55.559 --> 23:56.980
Amazing, right?

23:58.040 --> 24:09.626
Yeah, you know, usually he's very nasty, but this time... He decided to be a little sweet for you Ruffians.

24:09.706 --> 24:11.828
Just for the Ruffians, huh?

24:11.888 --> 24:13.749
The name is a bit different, huh?

24:15.529 --> 24:18.171
BAU BAU!

24:18.191 --> 24:23.974
But we really hope that that's helped you enjoy things a little bit more together with us so far this week!

24:26.455 --> 24:31.540
But we're still doing streams in English at our usual times this week like always though!

24:31.840 --> 24:38.387
So if maybe you can't stay up until the middle of the night to be there live for the streams, don't worry!

24:38.407 --> 24:43.571
You can also check the live chat on the archive for Peron's translations too!

24:45.353 --> 24:50.677
I guess as for when Pero will show up next door, we're not too sure.

24:51.418 --> 24:53.900
I guess whenever he can.

24:53.940 --> 24:58.844
But we hope it'll be often though.

24:59.104 --> 25:04.468
We know there were some very kind Ruffians who would do the live translation for us as well.

25:04.828 --> 25:07.651
But really, we don't want to put pressure on you.

25:07.891 --> 25:10.273
We want you to be able to enjoy the streams as well.

25:12.174 --> 25:16.298
Of course, you know, we're super appreciative of all your help as well.

25:16.678 --> 25:18.280
And, uh, who knows, you know?

25:18.440 --> 25:21.543
Maybe we might need it again sometime in the future, too!

25:21.703 --> 25:22.203
Okay!

25:22.444 --> 25:26.087
Thank you so much, everyone!

25:26.267 --> 25:28.449
BAU BAU!

25:28.509 --> 25:29.870
Thank you, too, pal.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.091
Yeah, I guess.

25:31.191 --> 25:33.674
BAU BAU!

25:34.574 --> 25:36.316
BAU BAU!

25:36.336 --> 25:38.338
If only that time

25:39.753 --> 25:41.214
I guess it's the middle of the week, huh?

25:41.234 --> 25:43.635
It's the middle of the week, Ruffians!

25:43.915 --> 25:46.057
How has the week been going for you?

25:46.437 --> 25:48.078
Japan has Golden Week!

25:48.638 --> 25:52.881
But you probably don't have a holiday week right now too, right?

25:54.441 --> 25:58.564
Do you need a little bit of some pop?

25:58.684 --> 26:03.287
Maybe?

26:04.107 --> 26:04.887
Moco-chan.

26:07.020 --> 26:11.262
Is it okay if... I do a pup talk this time?

26:11.542 --> 26:14.283
Okay!

26:14.483 --> 26:17.045
BAU BAU!

26:19.346 --> 26:20.566
Ruffians!

26:21.267 --> 26:23.968
It's that time of the week again!

26:27.770 --> 26:30.831
It's time for a Mococo pup talk!

26:31.451 --> 26:32.332
But this time...

26:33.437 --> 26:37.360
It's a Fuwawa Pup Talk!

26:38.600 --> 26:42.023
So that means you're going to hear it straight from me!

26:42.483 --> 26:43.644
Fuwawa!

26:46.345 --> 26:47.606
Ruffians!

26:48.407 --> 26:49.307
BAU BAU!

26:50.508 --> 26:53.110
How have you been holding up this week so far?

26:54.070 --> 26:57.973
Has it been a little more rough than usual?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.690
But, you're doing your absolute best!

27:07.371 --> 27:09.471
I know it!

27:09.491 --> 27:11.131
So, please hang in there.

27:11.591 --> 27:13.212
Don't let things get you down.

27:13.732 --> 27:17.012
And just take each moment as it comes, you know?

27:17.632 --> 27:24.654
And hopefully, you can count on Moco-chan and I to protect your smile during the really rough times too.

27:25.234 --> 27:25.694
Okay?

27:28.034 --> 27:32.695
I know, there are probably a bunch of things that you're putting off too, right?

27:33.686 --> 27:37.497
You know, those things that no one wants to do.

27:37.517 --> 27:39.323
The important things.

27:44.085 --> 27:46.467
I know, I feel that way too.

27:46.487 --> 27:52.130
I know you work hard, you want to have fun when it's time to have fun.

27:52.851 --> 27:58.374
But let's do them together and then we'll get them out of the way!

27:59.215 --> 28:05.139
And that means that we can have even more fun together when it's time to have fun.

28:05.739 --> 28:06.840
Okay?

28:07.780 --> 28:09.041
I believe in you!

28:09.581 --> 28:11.522
So do your best, okay?

28:12.643 --> 28:14.264
I'm cheering for you!

28:14.804 --> 28:18.105
And I'll be here to give you a little push when you need it too.

28:18.125 --> 28:19.585
Ganbatte ne!

28:19.685 --> 28:20.606
BAU BAU!

28:20.726 --> 28:22.126
BAU BAU!

28:22.286 --> 28:27.128
How did I do, Moco-chan?

28:33.917 --> 28:44.784
I'll do my best next time then too.

28:44.925 --> 28:47.987
BAU BAU!

28:48.147 --> 28:53.030
Well, we'll take a look at a regular cornice from you Ruffians!

28:53.811 --> 28:56.813
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

29:00.038 --> 29:04.963
RGOS is super cuddly and fuzzy!

29:05.383 --> 29:08.466
RGOS, you know, he's very silly amongst Kami-Rums.

29:08.787 --> 29:11.970
Fuzzy and cuddly and silly.

29:23.572 --> 29:26.517
Waggles can have the looky.

29:37.381 --> 29:40.404
How do you think Oracle's BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

30:01.135 --> 30:04.981
I don't know if I can do a very good job today, but the best I was.

30:05.541 --> 30:06.703
BAU BAU!

30:07.144 --> 30:08.626
BAU BAU!

30:11.888 --> 30:24.615
I look super cute with those big ears and puppy dog eyes.

30:25.075 --> 30:28.177
And nose that makes you want to go boop to it too.

30:28.817 --> 30:31.879
And it sounds like he has also very good manners.

30:36.380 --> 30:43.583
I think we all know that summer's just around the corner too, so we hope that you play in the water with him lots soon!

30:43.763 --> 30:44.043
BAU BAU!

30:44.103 --> 30:45.464
Have fun!

30:45.524 --> 30:46.405
Bye ghosts!

30:46.525 --> 30:49.086
BAU BAU!

30:49.246 --> 30:50.666
So cute!

30:50.827 --> 30:52.747
Hi!

30:52.987 --> 30:54.168
Wow, Ruffians!

30:54.208 --> 30:56.929
You've still been going on lots of walks, right?

30:57.690 --> 30:59.230
Let's see which walks you've been going on.

30:59.250 --> 30:59.791
What walks?

30:59.851 --> 31:00.291
Which walks?

31:00.771 --> 31:01.631
Where you been going?

31:01.711 --> 31:02.112
BAU BAU!

31:03.432 --> 31:04.153
Let's take a look.

31:04.373 --> 31:05.373
De-den!

31:06.094 --> 31:08.495
Osaka Castle!

31:08.615 --> 31:12.077
Osaka Castle!

31:13.758 --> 31:16.199
This is the view from the very top.

31:16.379 --> 31:20.822
What an adventure!

31:21.142 --> 31:25.684
We hope you make sure to take a good break and get something yummy to eat afterwards.

31:25.744 --> 31:27.285
Yeah, maybe a bunch of takoyaki!

31:27.325 --> 31:28.546
Right!

31:28.766 --> 31:31.467
Get that energy back!

31:32.728 --> 31:36.171
Take a couple octopus legs and put them in your tummy.

31:36.191 --> 31:37.912
Make sure it's not too hot, doggy.

31:37.972 --> 31:39.954
You'll burn your mouth.

31:40.834 --> 31:45.318
Well, we hope you continue to have lots of fun adventures around Japan, okay?

31:45.338 --> 31:46.118
BAU BAU!

31:49.545 --> 31:55.288
Next for our Question of the Day, we received Nerden!

31:55.308 --> 31:58.610
Nyahalo, FUWAMOCO!

31:58.670 --> 32:10.537
Now that you've obtained and tested a dual-stream PC setup, is there anything in particular that you're really excited about trying, or are you still theorycrafting and looking for ideas on it?

32:10.577 --> 32:12.438
Thanks for all your hard work!

32:12.538 --> 32:14.540
BAU BAU BAU!

32:14.640 --> 32:17.762
Well, I think what we're looking forward to the most right now

32:18.562 --> 32:19.162
Moco-chan.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.845
Minecraft!

32:22.865 --> 32:28.288
You know, it's been something that we really wanted to get into and just haven't been able to yet.

32:28.628 --> 32:34.772
So we're really looking forward to being able to play it together and explore all together with you Ruffians.

32:34.992 --> 32:36.273
We'll really need your help.

32:36.593 --> 32:38.194
It's a little bit intimidating.

32:38.214 --> 32:38.894
A lot.

32:40.135 --> 32:42.898
A lot intimidating.

32:42.938 --> 32:47.343
But we're still very much looking for ideas and suggestions also.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.884
Let us know, okay?

32:48.925 --> 32:54.911
There's a lot of games that I'm sure would be perfect for the both of us to play, but we just don't know about them.

32:54.951 --> 32:56.092
There are some limits.

32:57.895 --> 32:59.176
We tried a bunch of stuff.

33:00.096 --> 33:02.337
Team Fortress 2.

33:02.757 --> 33:03.897
I don't know it.

33:05.478 --> 33:11.599
There's a lot of different things, but we really want to experiment and try everything we can.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.620
But we can't do split screen.

33:14.200 --> 33:14.800
We tried.

33:17.141 --> 33:18.922
That's not something that will work.

33:19.022 --> 33:20.983
BAU BAU!

33:21.063 --> 33:30.168
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions, your questions, your doggies, your books, and your Pero Sightings!

33:30.508 --> 33:36.412
Please continue to send them to us with the hashtag FWMCMORNING!

33:36.552 --> 33:37.212
Okay?

33:37.312 --> 33:38.613
Ruffians!

33:39.508 --> 33:45.850
Your part of FUWAMOCO Morning, a very important part, so please do yourself a meeting, oki?

33:45.950 --> 33:47.611
We're waiting, oki!

33:47.631 --> 33:50.652
BAU BAU!

33:51.392 --> 33:56.494
And for our next stream that we have coming up, we have De-den!

33:56.534 --> 33:58.655
Super chat meeting!

33:58.755 --> 34:00.356
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

34:00.436 --> 34:01.356
Thank you so much!

34:01.878 --> 34:02.699
All the time.

34:02.719 --> 34:06.423
FUWAMOCO We really wanna read them!

34:06.463 --> 34:10.207
We just have not had enough time to be able to chat all together.

34:10.687 --> 34:14.511
And Moco-chan, your bark is not barking the best right now too.

34:14.592 --> 34:15.092
Really?

34:17.234 --> 34:18.776
You think so?

34:19.436 --> 34:22.099
You think I sound funny right now?

34:22.159 --> 34:24.181
But we're gonna chat.

34:24.261 --> 34:25.622
I haven't heard that one yet.

34:25.682 --> 34:30.186
We're gonna chat as much as we can chat with Nerissa, right Moco-chan?

34:31.328 --> 34:33.089
So we hope that you'll be there.

34:33.770 --> 34:39.996
And once your barkers bark you like normal, then we'll spend a ton of time chatting, okay Ruffians?

34:40.516 --> 34:42.337
We're really looking forward to it!

34:42.978 --> 34:44.558
BAU BAU!

34:45.259 --> 34:49.601
And if we take another peek at our schedule here, there's so much!

34:49.621 --> 34:50.582
Where do we start?

34:50.942 --> 34:52.243
First we start!

34:52.743 --> 34:54.864
After our super chat reading later!

34:56.125 --> 35:01.649
Wonderful company's back together with Fubuki-senpai and Koyori-senpai and us!

35:01.830 --> 35:04.832
And we're playing Lethal Company!

35:05.332 --> 35:07.774
It was so much fun last time!

35:07.794 --> 35:10.136
We got into a whole bunch of silly business.

35:10.396 --> 35:16.081
But this time, Fuwawa, I'm gonna be playing too in my own steam.

35:16.361 --> 35:18.242
It'll be split-screen again.

35:18.302 --> 35:19.683
Not split-screen.

35:19.783 --> 35:21.365
Ah, not split-screen.

35:21.565 --> 35:22.746
Dual screens.

35:23.186 --> 35:25.968
Funny business.

35:42.429 --> 35:43.369
Help me up, okay?

35:43.870 --> 35:45.250
BAU BAU!

35:45.770 --> 35:51.713
After that too, we're also going to be playing content learning together with Haachama-senpai for the very first time!

35:51.833 --> 35:52.513
And Pororo-neechan.

35:52.633 --> 35:59.216
And Pororo-neechan, but it'll be really fun playing together with them and trying to make viral videos!

35:59.796 --> 36:03.298
I have no doubt in their viral-ability skills.

36:03.998 --> 36:09.861
So, let's do our best to make sure that we're a good addition to our production team, okay?

36:11.502 --> 36:13.804
And those are the next teams coming up!

36:13.824 --> 36:14.865
BAU BAU!

36:14.965 --> 36:19.468
Please also join us for our Minecraft journey!

36:19.548 --> 36:20.749
Yeah!

36:20.809 --> 36:22.290
Lots of fun stuff coming up!

36:22.971 --> 36:29.636
And for VALVians who are joining us through the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO-ed word!

36:29.656 --> 36:31.238
