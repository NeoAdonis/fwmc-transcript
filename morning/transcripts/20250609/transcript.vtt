00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.288
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:02.628 --> 00:05:08.197
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:13.445
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.629
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.495
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:27.246
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:27.507
BAU BAU!

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:31.853
Thank you for joining us today for our 163rd episode!

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:35.759
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.979
Thank you!

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.783
Thank you all Ruffians!

00:05:38.763 --> 00:05:42.450
Before we know it, we'll be at our next milestone too here!

00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:45.957
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:56.659
Well, for those who are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short, fun morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.883
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:05:58.903 --> 00:06:00.687
And definitely once a week.

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:04.060
Yes, temporarily once a week.

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.464
But it's also hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:12.974
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you, yes, temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:06:13.034 --> 00:06:16.559
You know, so then we can get a bit more balance in our lives right now.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:22.488
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.209
Yes!

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.918
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:28.898 --> 00:06:32.844
It's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:35.247
BAU BAU!

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:36.309
BAU BAU!

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:37.610
I've been watching you for a long time!

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.193
Thank you, BAU BAU!

00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:40.334
The best way to start the day!

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:40.935
Yeah!

00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:41.896
Yeah!

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:44.420
So Minecraft and the FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:46.583
Yeah!

00:06:46.643 --> 00:06:47.585
But you know!

00:06:47.605 --> 00:06:48.125
What?

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:50.368
Well, a brand new week is here!

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:55.316
So now, it's our job to start the day off on the right paw!

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.979
Right, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.500
Yeah!

00:06:59.948 --> 00:07:02.471
FUWAMOCO-chan, you waited up the week.

00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.833
Doesn't look like a rough one.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.519
Wow.

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:08.640
Wow?

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.740
Wow.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.483
It's a fun weekend, though, right?

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:11.604
Yeah.

00:07:11.624 --> 00:07:12.965
Like, Ruffians, it's a fun weekend, right?

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:14.247
Yeah.

00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:16.710
It's your birthday today!

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.231
FUWAMOCO, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:21.497
Man, I'm really sorry that I have following news for you.

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:21.737
Huh?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.102
On your birthday, too.

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:25.403
Oh, birthday.

00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:27.486
Of all the days!

00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:35.436
There's nothing nasty, so don't think- Moco-chan?

00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:36.457
There's been a Pero sighting.

00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:38.760
Oh, but not on the birthday!

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.842
I'm sorry, but it's important information.

00:07:40.862 --> 00:07:43.005
Maybe it'll be like another Pero cake!

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:48.872
You know, I thought it was a Pero sighting, but it was a very cute- That would be appropriate!

00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:52.449
Maybe not.

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:54.472
We don't know, but it's a feeling.

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:59.760
Let's take a look at what Pero looks like at this time.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.303
Let's take a look.

00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:04.226
De-den!

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:11.417
That is not a cheek.

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:14.496
What are we looking at?

00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:24.991
I don't know, this is just... Woah, there's a Pero, a cat, and a very suspiciously small crow out there.

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:27.734
I mean, the cat is super cute.

00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:29.737
Yeah, very very cute.

00:08:29.757 --> 00:08:33.102
There's just lots of other, you know, sightings.

00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:35.357
Nasty things going on.

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:38.900
Yeah, I don't know, just looking at this I feel worried.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.681
What do you think is going on?

00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:42.583
I feel anxious about the future.

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:45.205
What is happening to you?

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:45.946
It's way deep.

00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:49.489
Yeah, why is the clown so smug?

00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:51.811
Why does he look like that?

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:52.392
I know.

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:54.073
Is he friends with Pero?

00:08:54.254 --> 00:08:55.955
Is that why he's smiling?

00:08:55.975 --> 00:08:57.837
I think it looks like he likes his job.

00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:01.300
That's good, but... I don't know.

00:09:02.697 --> 00:09:08.224
I feel like maybe he likes his job, but he's a bit... Moco-chan, did you notice one thing you know?

00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:09.946
Pero smiling.

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:11.769
Clown smiling.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.893
Cat smiling.

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:16.755
Yeah.

00:09:18.297 --> 00:09:20.921
Is the cat gonna be okay?

00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.561
I got nightmares!

00:09:21.902 --> 00:09:27.609
I don't know if FUWAMOCO is dead, I don't know if the cat would be okay, but I think... The clown and Pero maybe.

00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:29.852
Nightmares?

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:31.078
But maybe.

00:09:31.098 --> 00:09:32.781
This is too many questions.

00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:40.716
I think Ruffians, you know in this situation where no matter how much you look at it and try to analyze it, you just don't understand.

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:42.499
You're supposed to just turn around.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.642
What did you say?

00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:44.904
If you don't understand.

00:09:44.964 --> 00:09:46.126
Don't understand?

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.930
Yeah, if you don't understand.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.272
Don't understand it?

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:49.593
Turn around!

00:09:49.613 --> 00:09:50.194
Turn around!

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:51.216
Don't look at my- Don't understand?

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:02.514
BAU BAU!

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:17.187
BAU BAU!

00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:18.302
Agreed.

00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:20.885
Balloons for birthday!

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:24.388
Balloons also for the start of a new week, but birthday.

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:25.209
Yeah.

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:29.112
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.613 --> 00:10:32.115
Well, you know, speaking of birthday.

00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.256
BIRTHDAYS!

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:37.099
There was a birthday over the weekend!

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:39.902
There's a bunch of birthdays, but one in particular.

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:40.002
Yes!

00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:42.524
It was Hajime!

00:10:42.644 --> 00:10:44.967
BOOM BOOM BOOM!

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:46.568
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:46.588 --> 00:10:47.629
A week was his very first birthday!

00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:49.092
Happy Birthday!

00:10:49.112 --> 00:10:50.194
And guess what?

00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:50.915
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:53.841
We were guests too!

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:54.723
BAU BAU!

00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:57.929
We were part of the Otamayo Medley!

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.594
And Biboo was there too!

00:11:00.614 --> 00:11:04.862
I'm Koseki Bijou!

00:11:04.882 --> 00:11:05.483
We were cool right?

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:09.168
And we did the heart-to-massage!

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:10.029
Heart-to-massage!

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.594
With Hajime!

00:11:14.035 --> 00:11:16.639
You really brought me back to hololive!

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:19.182
Have a howl of a day too!

00:11:19.202 --> 00:11:21.746
Biboo talks too!

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.488
It's been a little while!

00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:26.552
Just so you know, Advent, we still shouldn't sing it together.

00:11:29.316 --> 00:11:35.905
BAU BAU, but you know, we got to see Hajime's amazing dancing all throughout the 3D Birthday!

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.449
And also a new song, too!

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:42.615
Please check it out, okay, Advent?

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.496
You have to check it out!

00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:44.537
Okay!

00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:47.181
I thought it was a very, very, uh, what's it?

00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:48.821
Emotional.

00:11:49.582 --> 00:11:57.400
Like, I was really touched even though I saw Hajime talking about how this was Hajime's very first time one!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.966
That's what the live was deemed as.

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:01.810
You know what Hajime always dreamed about?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.659
If he ever had, you know, their own event, they could've won it.

00:12:06.112 --> 00:12:11.217
So, you know, finally she's able to be the star of the show!

00:12:11.337 --> 00:12:12.198
First starring role!

00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:13.720
Yes, very important.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.803
I feel like I very much understand her feelings all now.

00:12:16.823 --> 00:12:23.770
Yeah, so we're happy to be a part of the show.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.871
Happy birthday Hajime!

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:25.772
BAU BAU!

00:12:26.753 --> 00:12:27.233
BAU BAU!

00:12:27.253 --> 00:12:32.018
Because of our celebrations,

00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:33.591
I know I'm evolving.

00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:36.692
Well, it's June!

00:12:37.094 --> 00:12:43.343
I feel like maybe this sort of, you know, um, snuck up on a bunch of Ruffians!

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.546
Yeah, but you don't!

00:12:46.127 --> 00:12:50.193
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:52.176
It's that time of year!

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:52.797
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:52.817 --> 00:12:53.138
Too bright even!

00:12:53.158 --> 00:12:53.618
Too bright voice patch!

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:56.362
And now available on the hololive official shop!

00:12:56.683 --> 00:12:59.988
Great downloadable GGM paws!

00:13:00.008 --> 00:13:01.790
And I have a very cute Shiori!

00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.712
No shipping!

00:13:03.072 --> 00:13:03.513
Nothing!

00:13:04.014 --> 00:13:06.898
And you know, GG already just made!

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:13.745
FUWAMOCO Wedding is very cute!

00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:22.515
We have two of our voices on sale!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:30.203
You can listen to them in English, Japanese, and you can also take a listen to the sound after the story.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:36.684
Ruffians, you know you can listen to the sample on the website when you don't need to because I don't really want you to.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:40.773
It's just, um... Embarrassing!

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:44.903
Don't go and listen to it, okay?

00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:50.014
I feel like the Ruffians very much enjoy the June Bright season, huh?

00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:53.642
Because you know, it's the first time we're viewing.

00:13:54.585 --> 00:14:02.846
And you know, this time, I know Ruffians maybe last year you know we had a little bit different wedding and everything, you know.

00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:04.611
But this time!

00:14:05.097 --> 00:14:09.843
This time, in case it wasn't obvious, the scenarios are different!

00:14:10.403 --> 00:14:12.426
So, please check them out, you know?

00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:16.270
You can sort of get to see... Fuwawa!

00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:21.136
Seeing flowers together with Fuwawa and maybe after... I'm about to marry you.

00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:29.446
After getting groceries together with Fuwawa!

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:29.566
Yeah!

00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:31.088
It's a golden...

00:14:31.068 --> 00:14:35.637
Also come home to Moco-chan there!

00:14:36.498 --> 00:14:36.558
Hi!

00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:39.363
Yeah, maybe, no, Moco-chan.

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:43.231
You might come take a look at your wedding dress.

00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:43.671
No!

00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:44.293
No!

00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:48.641
You know that you can't look at the wedding dress before, right?

00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:50.985
It should be common knowledge, huh?

00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:52.167
It's a common knowledge!

00:14:52.187 --> 00:14:53.650
It should be common knowledge!

00:14:54.473 --> 00:14:56.376
Last year was amazing!

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.661
Well then you have to check out this year's too!

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:00.943
This year there's an after story.

00:15:01.504 --> 00:15:04.088
Which are in both English and Japanese as well.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:06.512
Please check them out.

00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:13.022
It's a little bit of a doki doki kind of time of year, but please check them out.

00:15:13.002 --> 00:15:19.533
Unfortunately, or fortunately, they're only on sale until September 29th!

00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:20.795
They are limited.

00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:24.902
It may be hard to understand, but they are limited!

00:15:24.922 --> 00:15:36.982
But, you know, so... We put our hearts into them, so... Powerful.

00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:37.423
Yeah.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.462
So you have a few months, okay.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:43.825
Is it the same story for both English and Japanese?

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:44.826
It is, I'm sure.

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:48.710
It might be a bit of a different story.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.992
A little bit of a different feeling.

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:54.315
It's up to you, you know.

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:55.156
I'm sure.

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.097
Please take it all, okay?

00:15:57.158 --> 00:15:58.779
Why are digital goods limited?

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.421
It's up to you, maybe.

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:05.385
Maybe there's another one next year, because this one's in 2025.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:07.949
Maybe, I don't know.

00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:09.612
I don't know, that's my thought.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:10.773
Your theory.

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:13.998
My theory, that's why.

00:16:14.018 --> 00:16:14.118
Yeah.

00:16:17.183 --> 00:16:20.268
No, I think it's just because there'll be another one maybe again, eventually.

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:22.832
Maybe another wedding.

00:16:24.314 --> 00:16:28.200
Maybe, you know, that's the thing is, you know, nothing is ever...

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:32.521
There's people that just like having weddings a lot, right?

00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:35.285
So they have weddings one year and another year, right?

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:37.087
Are there people like that?

00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:39.530
I guess we're like that, huh, Moco-chan?

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.812
Are we doing the bow?

00:16:41.832 --> 00:16:42.193
Oh, like that!

00:16:42.213 --> 00:16:43.174
Is that what it's called?

00:16:43.674 --> 00:16:44.936
They just have a wedding for fun.

00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.117
Yeah, I know.

00:16:46.197 --> 00:16:47.078
It's beautiful.

00:16:47.098 --> 00:16:48.520
I've never heard of that.

00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:50.622
I've never heard of that.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.645
I guess FUWAMOCO, we're like that, huh?

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:53.746
Every June.

00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:57.951
All the hololive members, every June.

00:16:58.792 --> 00:16:59.954
It's June Brite season.

00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:01.017
Don't forget.

00:17:03.121 --> 00:17:05.085
BAU BAU!

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:06.989
Yeah, and no shipping.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.973
Direct into your paws.

00:17:11.137 --> 00:17:14.404
We have some other happy things to happen!

00:17:14.975 --> 00:17:20.762
This is the second FUWAMOCO Morning in a row that we get to share this role!

00:17:21.784 --> 00:17:23.366
We must be jealous!

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:28.252
Well, we finished another game!

00:17:28.913 --> 00:17:29.013
Yeah!

00:17:29.033 --> 00:17:29.193
BAU BAU!

00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:29.533
BAU BAU!

00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:30.174
We said goodbye to Fatal Frame!

00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:30.294
Yeah!

00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:31.776
We finished a PS2 game that we've been playing!

00:17:31.816 --> 00:17:33.338
The classic one!

00:17:33.358 --> 00:17:34.840
Yeah, you know...

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.985
We're trying to find our big brother, Malfoy!

00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:40.429
He's in the scary Himuro Mansion!

00:17:40.449 --> 00:17:46.078
We went in there and then we found out the story about the rope shrine priestess!

00:17:46.138 --> 00:17:47.239
Yeah, the meeting.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.541
Her sadness.

00:17:49.142 --> 00:17:55.973
You know, we have mom's camera, the mystical, suspicious, crazy crown camera!

00:17:56.033 --> 00:18:00.720
You know, it pointed and drives the ghosts away, but it's very scary!

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.363
We finally found our brother!

00:18:02.343 --> 00:18:08.630
And he said, no, I'm gonna stay with the crazy, crazy giant maiden I just met.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.030
Goodbye.

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:11.253
Haa!

00:18:11.273 --> 00:18:12.854
BAU BAU yo!

00:18:13.415 --> 00:18:15.718
What about your little sister, HAI?

00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:18.781
More shocking than that though.

00:18:19.362 --> 00:18:26.830
You know, Moco-chan kept on reloading at the end of a boss fight being like, is that good enough?

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.771
Did I use too many healing items?

00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:29.052
Did I do well enough to get lots of points?

00:18:29.072 --> 00:18:30.814
You only get so many healing items.

00:18:31.604 --> 00:18:37.331
Only to find out that the final battles... If you get hit by the boss, you're dead.

00:18:38.112 --> 00:18:43.038
There's no use for healing items!

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:43.539
Moco-chan!

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.002
All our healing items!

00:18:46.603 --> 00:18:48.065
All the restarts!

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:50.247
All the worry and anxiety!

00:18:50.688 --> 00:18:53.992
About not having items when we need it at the end of the game!

00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:55.654
Ruffians!

00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:58.984
You should've told me.

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.650
It's your fault, officially.

00:19:01.715 --> 00:19:04.566
It's because I tingle!

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.249
Because I tingle!

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:05.791
Because I tingle!

00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:06.775
It's okay!

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:37.318
BAU BAU!

00:19:37.298 --> 00:19:39.411
Yeah, yes, demon dog.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.153
Nightmare mode is not happening.

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:47.259
But there is still more Fatal Frame games!

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:50.504
Like Fatal Frame 2 on PS2 as well!

00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:54.289
So maybe one day we'll get to play that too huh?

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.411
We'll have to see!

00:19:55.892 --> 00:19:58.435
Stick around!

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:01.119
BAU BAU!

00:20:01.139 --> 00:20:03.122
Thank you Ruffians!

00:20:03.142 --> 00:20:03.303
BAU BAU!

00:20:03.323 --> 00:20:05.326
Yeah we're gaming demon dogs!

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:07.609
Speaking of games...

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:10.060
Catch the big game last night.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.565
The big game, Moco-chan.

00:20:14.966 --> 00:20:21.593
Because hololive is coming back to the Dodgers!

00:20:21.613 --> 00:20:24.095
There's another hololive night happening in Los Angeles Dodgers!

00:20:24.115 --> 00:20:24.596
Dodgers Stadium.

00:20:24.636 --> 00:20:25.737
Yeah, Dodgers Stadium.

00:20:25.797 --> 00:20:29.822
A second time in the last year was the first hololive night with the Dodgers.

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:31.944
And it's back this year.

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.727
It's gonna be taking place on July 5th.

00:20:34.707 --> 00:20:35.147
2025!

00:20:35.188 --> 00:20:36.149
It's here, yes!

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:37.470
It's here!

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.870
Very soon!

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.993
Just in case you don't know because I get coffee still.

00:20:40.013 --> 00:20:41.334
It's less than a month.

00:20:41.354 --> 00:20:43.296
But it starts at 4.15pm!

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:45.879
That time at the Dodgers Stadium!

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.521
At the Dodgers' home!

00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.882
It's nice!

00:20:48.902 --> 00:20:53.367
And you know, there'll be lots of fun stuff including... Guess what?

00:20:53.848 --> 00:20:55.750
Martindale!

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.593
But it's different though, it's the Dodgers' home!

00:20:58.613 --> 00:21:01.356
And then also, apparently...

00:21:01.336 --> 00:21:05.503
I saw, I saw the, the, the, you know, the report they said.

00:21:05.523 --> 00:21:06.524
The report?

00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:08.387
I thought like, oh my gosh, are they allowed to say all of this?

00:21:08.407 --> 00:21:09.088
What, what, what, what?

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:15.198
They said, there's gonna be a single long reason of take me out to the ballgame during the 7th inning.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:15.839
Oh!

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.722
Threat of the baseball game!

00:21:17.742 --> 00:21:17.963
Oh!

00:21:18.023 --> 00:21:20.687
And I have to be there for quite a while if it's the 7th inning maybe.

00:21:20.707 --> 00:21:21.268
All of them.

00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:27.902
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.144
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:32.711
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.896
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:34.956 --> 00:21:36.920
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:37.742 --> 00:21:40.928
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:42.654
That sounds so much fun!

00:21:42.854 --> 00:21:45.924
So that means you can just go and have a big party on the field!

00:21:46.004 --> 00:21:49.596
Dancing to like, you know, Kirameki Riders!

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:49.736
Right!

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:51.040
Shining Smile Story!

00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:52.003
Yeah!

00:21:52.224 --> 00:21:54.411
Wicked Dimensions!

00:21:55.117 --> 00:21:57.060
Why are there spoilers?

00:21:57.521 --> 00:21:58.482
That's too fun.

00:21:59.184 --> 00:21:59.905
Is that allowed?

00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:01.768
Are you allowed to go on the field?

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:04.472
I don't know.

00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:05.434
That's amazing.

00:22:06.475 --> 00:22:10.862
And then, also the ticket package includes a ticket to the baseball game.

00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:12.124
That makes sense.

00:22:12.184 --> 00:22:18.795
That's an event exclusive Dodgers X hololive Trading Card.

00:22:18.775 --> 00:22:33.915
Ruffians, what are we gonna do, huh?

00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:39.879
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:52.528
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:22:52.508 --> 00:22:55.894
But it sounds like a super big party!

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:58.919
A real hololive night at the dodges!

00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:03.746
So we hope for maybe any Ruffians hololive fans who are really into baseball!

00:23:04.147 --> 00:23:06.050
That you have a bunch of fun there!

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.155
Or you know, you have baseball friends!

00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:12.040
You can be like, well, your hobby, my hobby, let's have fun!

00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:16.788
Yeah, we could wait maybe to get your friends into hololive too, huh?

00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:18.651
Or get you into baseball.

00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:25.966
I'm looking forward to it!

00:23:27.248 --> 00:23:27.869
I'm excited!

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:34.763
I don't understand baseball, but we like throwing the ball and chasing the ball.

00:23:35.966 --> 00:23:37.669
We're very competitive like that.

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:41.034
But we're super excited and so still!

00:23:41.114 --> 00:23:42.216
Go hololive go!

00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:42.817
And dodges.

00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:47.745
Go dodge your eyes!

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:48.005
BAU BAU!

00:23:48.025 --> 00:23:49.468
Just hit the ball and run.

00:23:49.488 --> 00:23:52.092
I think so, but then what if you have to go to the base?

00:23:52.112 --> 00:23:55.337
And then if they hit you, they're gonna punch you with the ball and then you're like, ouch!

00:23:55.317 --> 00:23:56.538
You're out!

00:23:56.598 --> 00:23:57.619
You're out of there!

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.848
Yeah, but then what if you know you're out in the field and the ball comes your way and you have the glove on and you have to catch it and then- Where do you throw it?!

00:24:06.868 --> 00:24:08.290
It hits it with the baseball bat.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.492
And then you catch it in your glove, they're out.

00:24:10.812 --> 00:24:11.393
Yeah.

00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:16.698
But what if you catch the ball and you know, then you gotta toss it to someone who you're tossing to.

00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:17.538
I don't get it.

00:24:17.578 --> 00:24:19.460
There's too much stress!

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.182
Everybody's watching the ball!

00:24:21.202 --> 00:24:24.345
All I know is that I'm very, very good

00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:26.610
At hitting foul balls.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.052
Good job, Moco-chan.

00:24:30.097 --> 00:24:31.219
Take the ball, don't give it back!

00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:31.880
It's your ball now!

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:36.670
And then you can go and take it to Biboo and be like, Biboo, can you sign this?

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.363
Good plan.

00:24:43.343 --> 00:24:48.469
And then I'll just trade the ball for the signed trading card.

00:24:48.689 --> 00:24:51.172
BAU BAU!

00:24:52.434 --> 00:24:59.623
FUWAMOCO, you also had some other milestones happen yesterday!

00:24:59.643 --> 00:25:03.868
Some of the cover songs have hit some big milestones!

00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:05.149
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:05.790
We have!

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.633
Identity!

00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:09.675
Our cover of Identity!

00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:12.600
It's a song we first released back on 20!

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.062
Good 20!

00:25:14.903 --> 00:25:20.030
You know, we kind of wanted to be able to sing this song to be able to talk about our identity as fans!

00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:24.176
You know, and now it's hit 2 million!

00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:27.340
Thank you so much for helping!

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.645
I hope you enjoy listening to it and maybe you've heard it before.

00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:32.308
Maybe you haven't heard it before.

00:25:32.768 --> 00:25:36.114
Please go check it out and make us really, really happy.

00:25:36.815 --> 00:25:37.376
But!

00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:39.980
Next!

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.681
Cute na Kanojo!

00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:43.726
Maybe this is the spookiest song covered by us.

00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:48.172
We released it for Halloween.

00:25:48.733 --> 00:25:51.518
And actually there's two different versions.

00:25:51.538 --> 00:25:53.040
Three different versions.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.563
We have FUWAMOCO together!

00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:59.569
And then also FUWARASOLO and MOCOCHAN SOLO!

00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:04.255
So you can kinda see all different versions of what we sing in like solo!

00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:12.687
And thanks to your Ruffians, it hit 1.5 million!

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:13.848
Thank you!

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:14.229
Thank you!

00:26:14.249 --> 00:26:18.775
You know, it doesn't have to be Halloween to listen to it though, you know?

00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:24.323
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:24.363 --> 00:26:28.589
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:41.286
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:43.584
Yeah!

00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:48.734
We released our very first Halloween after we debuted!

00:26:49.014 --> 00:26:54.124
The English version of Koyoiwa Halloween Night hololive song!

00:26:54.144 --> 00:26:54.304
Nerissa!

00:26:54.385 --> 00:26:58.292
She did the English lyrics and we sung it all together!

00:26:58.953 --> 00:27:00.135
It's such good memories.

00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:03.281
It's still the best version!

00:27:04.524 --> 00:27:05.265
Thank you!

00:27:05.245 --> 00:27:11.352
I think maybe, you know, many Adventrix don't really know about it.

00:27:11.372 --> 00:27:12.533
We'll definitely give it a good listen!

00:27:12.553 --> 00:27:15.416
You can hear it over on the official hololive English channel!

00:27:15.777 --> 00:27:19.401
And thanks to you, it reached 1 million views!

00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:21.883
Thank you!

00:27:21.903 --> 00:27:22.104
BAU BAU!

00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:28.030
I really like being able to sing the whole, like, you know, idol songs all together in English.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.257
It's funny, I feel like nowadays you don't really hear them.

00:27:31.277 --> 00:27:31.518
Right!

00:27:31.718 --> 00:27:39.595
I feel like you know, especially you hear that they can engage, like holo-cute, but otherwise they're not really sung that often.

00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.098
And it's a shame!

00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:43.202
They're good!

00:27:43.223 --> 00:27:43.523
They're good!

00:27:43.543 --> 00:27:44.626
They're so good and special!

00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:45.327
Lots of memories!

00:27:45.307 --> 00:27:52.357
You haven't listened to it?

00:27:52.377 --> 00:27:58.266
You should go for it then!

00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:05.256
It's very spooky but also very cute too.

00:28:05.236 --> 00:28:08.221
BAU BAU!

00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:11.246
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for listening to them lots and lots!

00:28:11.266 --> 00:28:20.862
FUWAMOCO, we really do love singing and music and being able to express ourselves this way, so we hope to continue to be able to sing lots and lots!

00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:24.628
And so, having you listen to our music and enjoy it and share it

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.715
Really kind words with us, it means a lot.

00:28:27.735 --> 00:28:28.777
It's really important.

00:28:28.797 --> 00:28:32.045
So thank you so much!

00:28:32.065 --> 00:28:32.265
Thank you!

00:28:32.285 --> 00:28:32.446
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:33.208
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:33.669
And!

00:28:33.689 --> 00:28:38.199
Yeah, just moments ago, a new event is happening!

00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:38.360
Yes!

00:28:38.861 --> 00:28:40.304
It's the whole live!

00:28:40.926 --> 00:28:43.191
Minecraft Gold Rush Survival!

00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:48.541
It just happened!

00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:51.346
Botan-senpai is organizing it!

00:28:52.048 --> 00:28:57.778
And you know in a special server, Botan-senpai, she created money.

00:28:59.962 --> 00:29:02.968
She created money.

00:29:02.948 --> 00:29:05.713
To pick a job and make money.

00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:08.078
So we've been doing just that!

00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:14.791
It's very interesting from the beginning.

00:29:14.811 --> 00:29:17.016
We have a bunch of different job classes we can pick.

00:29:17.316 --> 00:29:21.525
We can pick the sports, minor, primary.

00:29:22.647 --> 00:29:23.809
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:25.382
We decided, right?

00:29:25.703 --> 00:29:27.045
Exploring!

00:29:27.326 --> 00:29:29.369
Yeah, and we've had some pretty good success.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.275
I feel like we thought we succeeded pretty well and then I don't think we have.

00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:37.382
Well, we got a big water medal.

00:29:38.503 --> 00:29:42.269
And that means that's worth a hundred thousand gold.

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:49.020
Well, see, you know, when you get money, you have the money in your pocket, but you can't really do anything with it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.643
So, and if you die, then you lose half of it.

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:57.368
So, you have to make sure... What we did was we invested in the stocks.

00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:58.909
Invested in the stocks.

00:29:58.929 --> 00:30:00.891
And then we had some good luck.

00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:01.752
We had some good luck.

00:30:01.772 --> 00:30:04.375
We bought low and sold high.

00:30:05.235 --> 00:30:07.117
So then we were like, what do we do now?

00:30:07.137 --> 00:30:09.880
Because now Moco-chan has over 100,000 money.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.582
It's my money too, so that's 10,000 of my money.

00:30:13.804 --> 00:30:15.765
So then we bought a big white metal.

00:30:15.806 --> 00:30:17.387
And we can keep it.

00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:17.888
Yeah.

00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:18.989
Cuz that is a money.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.031
Yeah.

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.813
And now we won't lose it, right Moco-chan?

00:30:22.013 --> 00:30:22.254
No!

00:30:22.294 --> 00:30:26.239
Which is good because I've died a couple times because Moco-chan leaves me to die.

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:29.263
I'm not!

00:30:29.283 --> 00:30:32.087
But the source of this money, Moco-chan, where was it from?

00:30:32.107 --> 00:30:34.090
It was from Yagoro-san.

00:30:35.031 --> 00:30:38.576
Yagoro-san likes to show up randomly.

00:30:38.596 --> 00:30:39.778
Big world Yagoro-san.

00:30:40.158 --> 00:30:42.301
And we helped him to find a bunch of them.

00:30:42.802 --> 00:30:44.244
Like maybe... Altogether.

00:30:44.264 --> 00:30:45.706
I feel like at least a dozen.

00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:45.886
Six?

00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:47.188
A dozen, yeah.

00:30:49.126 --> 00:30:50.730
And so, we made one.

00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:52.734
Thanks to Yakko-san.

00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:56.483
But it definitely was quite a bit of a frenzy, huh?

00:30:56.664 --> 00:30:58.508
It's a bit of a frenzy!

00:30:58.528 --> 00:31:00.693
Yakko-san also makes a very scary sound when he dies.

00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:04.502
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:09.364
But you really don't know what's gonna happen.

00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:11.767
Who's gonna be the richest at the end of this?

00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:13.469
You know there's a bunch of mini-games.

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:16.513
Delimited events are happening too.

00:31:16.533 --> 00:31:18.416
So we're gonna do our best!

00:31:18.436 --> 00:31:21.119
And see just how much money we can make together.

00:31:22.801 --> 00:31:24.163
Although I don't know, Moco-chan.

00:31:24.203 --> 00:31:26.826
Is it okay for us to be together as a team?

00:31:27.106 --> 00:31:27.226
Yeah.

00:31:27.246 --> 00:31:27.707
Team.

00:31:27.727 --> 00:31:32.353
I guess you know you can just ask others to do quests and stuff for you, right?

00:31:32.413 --> 00:31:35.957
So... I didn't realize there was quests.

00:31:37.051 --> 00:31:49.272
Thank you.

00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:54.496
BAU BAU!

00:31:54.577 --> 00:31:57.160
BAU BAU!

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:15.124
BAU BAU!

00:32:15.104 --> 00:32:17.086
I don't know you at all.

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:23.713
It's a little bit of a rough start with that Pero Sighting, but I have a good feeling about this week, huh?

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.876
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:28.959
Are you still not quite feeling it yet?

00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:41.533
A little bit more... Nina Pup Talk.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.557
Moco-chan, can you share some kind words with us?

00:32:47.321 --> 00:32:50.173
Okay, here I go!

00:32:54.187 --> 00:32:55.409
Ruffians!

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.832
It's that time again!

00:32:58.593 --> 00:33:01.837
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:33:02.378 --> 00:33:04.280
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:33:04.741 --> 00:33:05.702
Mococo!

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:07.665
Ruffians!

00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:12.772
Sometimes, I know it's hard to deal with the punchy life you'll feel.

00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:16.316
Sometimes, your armor is stronger.

00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:19.080
And other, it's like it's not even there.

00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:28.446
I think the best thing we can do in situations like that where you feel overwhelmed, where you feel like you might do or say something you regret...

00:33:29.101 --> 00:33:31.685
You know, just take a deep breath.

00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:32.967
Try to look at the situation.

00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:37.794
And try to take a small break from things and come back to it when you're refreshed.

00:33:37.814 --> 00:33:39.296
You know, your armor is stronger.

00:33:40.678 --> 00:33:41.459
I know you can do it.

00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:44.284
So keep working towards your passions!

00:33:44.744 --> 00:33:49.191
But remember to take a break if things are not feeling like, you know, like they usually do.

00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:49.712
Okay!

00:33:50.513 --> 00:33:52.215
You're amazing so keep at it!

00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:52.716
Okay!

00:33:53.617 --> 00:33:55.360
Ganbatte de!

00:33:56.762 --> 00:33:57.403
BAU BAU!

00:33:57.383 --> 00:33:59.628
BAU BAU!

00:34:00.551 --> 00:34:02.415
Keep at it, okay, Ruffians?

00:34:02.495 --> 00:34:08.550
But you know when you're feeling a little bit off, like something's off, it's a little bit different than usual.

00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:10.615
Please take a rest, okay?

00:34:13.562 --> 00:34:13.823
BAU BAU!

00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:21.842
Let's take a look at some of the regular questions from the Ruffians today!

00:34:21.862 --> 00:34:22.965
We have a Doggie of the Day!

00:34:23.566 --> 00:34:30.580
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Winnie!

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:47.524
I thought you were gonna say that Winnie turned 26.

00:34:47.645 --> 00:34:54.154
But you know, Winnie could be 26.

00:34:54.691 --> 00:34:59.877
Happy birthday Winnie!

00:35:00.518 --> 00:35:01.218
Good job.

00:35:01.238 --> 00:35:04.502
How does Winnie bow bye?

00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:20.901
Can Winnie maybe eat a piece of a toy?

00:35:21.877 --> 00:35:26.084
BAU BAU!

00:35:26.104 --> 00:35:26.304
Hot.

00:35:26.425 --> 00:35:32.775
Very cute, but a little bit... really hot.

00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:34.738
BAU BAU!

00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:35.079
BAU BAU!

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:40.488
You know, Winnie's very special puppy has been there with you forever!

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:42.391
Almost 26 years.

00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:43.373
Almost, yeah.

00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:48.441
We're so happy to hear that you've made such a great change in your life.

00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:49.282
I know.

00:35:49.762 --> 00:35:54.867
I think it's very obvious here, but you have a very powerful, powerful... I know.

00:35:55.347 --> 00:35:57.129
Keeping your heart happy.

00:35:57.209 --> 00:35:58.170
Nice and warm.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.853
And also a lovable buddy, too!

00:36:01.873 --> 00:36:01.953
Yes!

00:36:02.073 --> 00:36:05.436
We hope that you enjoy many cuddles together from here on.

00:36:05.456 --> 00:36:05.797
Okay!

00:36:05.817 --> 00:36:06.717
Lots and lots, okay?

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.400
BAU BAU!

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:10.761
BAU BAU!

00:36:10.781 --> 00:36:11.642
And... Oh!

00:36:12.102 --> 00:36:13.183
For our next corner.

00:36:13.784 --> 00:36:16.446
For today, I went on a walk.

00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:18.428
We have...

00:36:18.408 --> 00:36:20.933
FUWAMOCO Day!

00:36:20.953 --> 00:36:21.454
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:21.474 --> 00:36:21.955
FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:22.636
Look at the weather!

00:36:22.657 --> 00:36:22.917
FUWAMOCO But!

00:36:23.218 --> 00:36:25.342
FUWAMOCO Weather not the trees!

00:36:25.362 --> 00:36:26.725
FUWAMOCO Trees!

00:36:26.745 --> 00:36:30.592
FUWAMOCO These are some of the oldest living things on the planet.

00:36:30.612 --> 00:36:34.881
FUWAMOCO That's why I like to look at them.

00:36:42.657 --> 00:36:44.640
Moco-chan.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.581
The twins!

00:36:46.302 --> 00:36:47.444
Top twins!

00:36:49.146 --> 00:36:50.969
Twins!

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:53.893
Yeah!

00:36:53.913 --> 00:36:54.574
Top twins!

00:36:55.235 --> 00:36:57.278
Are we top twins too?

00:36:58.399 --> 00:36:59.701
Yeah, maybe not that tall.

00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:05.610
Not that tall, but... You know, we've been around for a while too.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.911
How many people tall is that?

00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:11.618
Maybe you can count them by like average twins.

00:37:12.425 --> 00:37:12.745
What?

00:37:13.707 --> 00:37:16.070
I could probably count them by average tree height.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.374
I think it's probably at least 5 people tall.

00:37:19.394 --> 00:37:20.175
That's my estimate.

00:37:20.195 --> 00:37:20.736
I think it's much more.

00:37:22.158 --> 00:37:23.259
How many then?

00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:23.780
Estimate.

00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:26.283
I don't need to, it's tall.

00:37:27.405 --> 00:37:27.905
Yes.

00:37:27.925 --> 00:37:28.085
5.

00:37:28.105 --> 00:37:31.009
Yes!

00:37:31.029 --> 00:37:31.890
But you don't have to do that.

00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:35.275
They've made it much, much better for you.

00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:35.375
Yes!

00:37:35.976 --> 00:37:36.817
Please give them a hug.

00:37:37.618 --> 00:37:38.239
Unless you're not allowed to.

00:37:38.259 --> 00:37:39.560
Unless you're not allowed to.

00:37:40.121 --> 00:37:40.181
Oh.

00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:42.364
If you're not allowed, don't give them a hug.

00:37:42.884 --> 00:37:44.669
At least ask first.

00:37:44.689 --> 00:37:49.842
But you know, we hope that we can make a difference by protecting your smile too.

00:37:49.902 --> 00:37:50.845
So we'll continue to work hard.

00:37:50.945 --> 00:37:51.727
We're not a tweed though.

00:37:52.028 --> 00:37:53.853
We're demon dogs.

00:37:54.454 --> 00:37:56.800
BAU BAU!

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.986
Thank you for sticking with us on YouTube!

00:37:58.966 --> 00:38:02.571
And we have our Question of the Day!

00:38:02.591 --> 00:38:06.316
Today's Question of the Day is... This!

00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:10.341
How did you both feel when you first learned about the sneeze counter?

00:38:10.822 --> 00:38:15.428
Does it bother you now or compared to when you first learned about it?

00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:19.474
Did your feelings change when Fuwawa's sneezes started to be counted?

00:38:20.094 --> 00:38:23.539
I've been a Ruffian for a year and I'm confused by it.

00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:24.841
Confused?

00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:27.024
It makes us to be a little bit confused.

00:38:27.044 --> 00:38:29.187
You know, especially at first.

00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:32.712
And you know, there's not really any explanation or anything.

00:38:32.732 --> 00:38:35.415
Not everybody has the same calendar.

00:38:35.556 --> 00:38:36.958
It's only natural to count.

00:38:37.819 --> 00:38:40.002
Multiple five.

00:38:40.022 --> 00:38:45.790
But you know, it's just something very silly that the Ruffians have made for us.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:51.838
You know, and it makes us really happy and smile a lot that the Ruffians that you want

00:38:51.818 --> 00:38:54.822
To celebrate every sneeze of ours!

00:38:54.842 --> 00:38:54.983
Yeah!

00:38:55.003 --> 00:38:56.565
Especially when there's so many!

00:38:57.586 --> 00:38:59.769
I feel like they're more rare nowadays.

00:38:59.789 --> 00:39:01.612
Oh, maybe that's for you, Moco-chan.

00:39:02.634 --> 00:39:06.199
But my sneezes have been counted from the very beginning, too!

00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:10.345
I just sneezed at a much slower rate than Moco-chan.

00:39:10.365 --> 00:39:14.631
600 going strong!

00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:15.011
I just passed 100!

00:39:15.031 --> 00:39:15.111
600!

00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:15.232
Yeah!

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:17.134
Almost, almost, and not quite, Moco-chan.

00:39:17.214 --> 00:39:18.176
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:39:18.196 --> 00:39:20.159
What was my best record for one stream?

00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:21.100
I think 23?

Sneeze taxi.

00:39:53.326 --> 00:39:54.789
Sneeze counting is not weird.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.172
It's not weird!

00:39:57.192 --> 00:39:58.374
It's silly just like us.

00:40:03.762 --> 00:40:04.423
Thank you!

00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:06.226
20 minutes stream sounds rough.

00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:06.666
It was very rough.

00:40:06.686 --> 00:40:09.110
It wasn't like 8 hours or anything either.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.951
3?

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.295
23 and a half?

00:40:12.315 --> 00:40:13.497
How many hours?

00:40:13.517 --> 00:40:13.957
Yeah.

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:16.141
4 hours maybe.

00:40:16.862 --> 00:40:17.142
Maximum.

00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:26.652
Minecraft makes you pretty sneezy and sleepy too, I guess.

00:40:26.672 --> 00:40:27.713
Hi!

00:40:27.733 --> 00:40:29.576
See, be sneezy and snoozing.

00:40:31.618 --> 00:40:33.561
Sneezy, snoozy, hi.

00:40:38.267 --> 00:40:42.853
You know, it makes us really happy to be able to get questions of all different types, you know?

00:40:42.913 --> 00:40:46.217

Oh, what's the next stream?

00:41:26.125 --> 00:41:30.470
Our next stream is... De-den!

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.732
The BAU BAU T-shirt!

00:41:32.752 --> 00:41:33.933

00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:42.882
We are!

00:41:42.902 --> 00:41:46.746
And I'm looking forward to running our own T-shirt!

00:41:46.766 --> 00:41:46.866
Yeah!

00:41:46.846 --> 00:41:50.894
Apparently it gets scary, but you know... Businesses, you know!

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.079
Running a business is a risk!

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:54.101
Financial risk!

00:41:54.822 --> 00:41:56.426
It can be pretty scary!

00:41:56.446 --> 00:41:57.408
Pretty risky!

00:41:57.688 --> 00:42:02.578
You know, boba is delicious, but if you drink too much of it, it's not that good for you!

00:42:02.598 --> 00:42:03.821
You need vitamins!

00:42:03.841 --> 00:42:05.023

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:26.318
We're gonna be focusing on making sure that our bubble tea, our boba, is the most delicious for our customers.

00:42:26.538 --> 00:42:29.261
We're not gonna be drinking any, right, Moco-chan?

00:42:29.281 --> 00:42:29.521
No.

00:42:30.463 --> 00:42:33.907
So we hope that we can make you proud, Ruffians.

00:42:34.608 --> 00:42:39.574
And that you also share your favorite bubble tea flavors with us.

00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:41.216
Ruffians, what's your favorite?

00:42:41.236 --> 00:42:41.916
I wanna hear it now.

00:42:42.437 --> 00:42:44.920
It's either milk tea or taro.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.502
It's always that.

00:43:06.155 --> 00:43:06.275
Mocha.

00:43:06.295 --> 00:43:06.456
Mocha.

00:43:06.476 --> 00:43:06.596
Mocha.

00:43:07.037 --> 00:43:07.157
Mocha.

00:43:07.137 --> 00:43:21.511
Well, if a lot of Ruffians haven't had... Well, boba tea.

00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:22.193
Boba tea then.

00:43:22.173 --> 00:43:24.739
We're just gonna have to make it!

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.124
BAU BAU!

00:43:27.144 --> 00:43:30.933
And that will be later today, so at 6pm PT.

00:43:30.973 --> 00:43:32.877
But let's take a look at our schedule!

00:43:32.997 --> 00:43:34.000
Our schedule!

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.026
Brand new!

00:43:37.207 --> 00:43:37.347
De-den!

00:43:37.327 --> 00:43:40.274
It's a little busy, busy, busy, busy week.

00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:41.717
A little bit of a busy week.

00:43:42.218 --> 00:43:47.089
We're gonna be doing some more of the Gold Rush Survival Minecraft.

00:43:48.131 --> 00:43:55.588
And then, on Tuesday at 6pm, we'll be doing some more chatting and super chat reading together, Ruffians.

00:43:55.568 --> 00:43:59.472
Wednesday, we're back early morning at 5am PT.

00:43:59.492 --> 00:44:02.496
This time, this day is a little bit later earlier.

00:44:02.516 --> 00:44:04.898
Depends on your perspective than usual.

00:44:04.919 --> 00:44:06.600
It starts at 5am PT.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.784
We're back doing some more Minecraft making money.

00:44:10.144 --> 00:44:18.814
And then later at 6pm PT, together with Biboo and Shiori, we're playing Elden Ring Nightmare.

00:44:18.834 --> 00:44:20.496
Our first time ever Elden Ring.

00:44:20.476 --> 00:44:22.320
I don't know if this counts.

00:44:22.441 --> 00:44:22.902
I don't know.

00:44:22.922 --> 00:44:23.383
Does it count?

00:44:23.443 --> 00:44:24.746
Does it count?

00:44:24.847 --> 00:44:26.671
People are like, let's play Nightmare.

00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:28.235
Like, okay!

00:44:30.821 --> 00:44:32.164
So we're gonna do our best.

00:44:32.184 --> 00:44:33.588
We're gonna make you proud.

00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:36.214
And we're gonna ask people all the questions.

00:44:36.595 --> 00:44:38.620
So many questions that maybe some people are like,

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:39.868
Hi.

00:44:40.028 --> 00:44:43.874
First time ever meeting Ruff.

00:44:44.495 --> 00:44:47.780
But it'll be fun because we'll be all together.

00:44:48.822 --> 00:44:50.304
With a cute boy too.

00:44:50.785 --> 00:44:53.369
And on Thursday we have a bit of a recording day.

00:44:53.489 --> 00:45:00.459
But we're back on Friday morning at 3am PT for the finale of the Gold Rush Survival.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.322
I guess that day is the last day.

00:45:02.743 --> 00:45:06.008
The richest will be crowned with the crown of the richest.

00:45:05.988 --> 00:45:07.870
Wow.

00:45:08.711 --> 00:45:09.371
At 6pm!

00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:10.393
6pm!

00:45:10.593 --> 00:45:16.279
At 5pm PT we're gonna be playing Fatal Frame 2!

00:45:16.299 --> 00:45:16.399
Yeah!

00:45:16.419 --> 00:45:17.019
Fatal Frame 2!

00:45:17.039 --> 00:45:17.640
It's here!

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:17.900
It's here!

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.245
I know there's so many Ruffians have looked forward to it but we're gonna be starting it off.

00:45:22.865 --> 00:45:30.493
It's a bit of a different story from the previous Fatal Frame so if you didn't catch Fatal Frame you're like, I don't know the story though!

00:45:30.513 --> 00:45:31.034
I'm late!

00:45:31.334 --> 00:45:34.097
Don't worry because it's standalone I think.

00:45:34.117 --> 00:45:35.218
And apparently the main character

00:45:35.198 --> 00:45:36.806
These are twin sisters!

00:45:38.855 --> 00:45:41.327
So let's just play twin sisters.

00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:44.346
As a pair of twin sisters.

00:45:45.607 --> 00:45:50.173
And then on Saturday we're going to be continuing it at the same time, 5pm P.M.

00:45:50.433 --> 00:45:51.634
I'm playing it on the PS2 too!

00:45:52.495 --> 00:45:57.582
So enjoy the horrors of accidentally issuing the PS2 delay.

00:45:58.062 --> 00:46:07.213
Moco-chan decides that she wants to restart and then we have to go and restart the PS2 and it makes the PS2 sounds.

00:46:07.193 --> 00:46:09.695
BAU BAU!

00:46:09.715 --> 00:46:10.396
And that's all day we have!

00:46:10.416 --> 00:46:12.978
All members only stream together with the Doggy Pack.

00:46:13.078 --> 00:46:16.141
We're continuing to play Coordinated Dimension.

00:46:16.161 --> 00:46:18.684
It was a super fun action platform.

00:46:18.704 --> 00:46:22.567
So many donuts, super cute, so colorful, such a great soundtrack.

00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:24.709
Lots of love going into it.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.712
So we're gonna play together with you Ruffians.

00:46:27.732 --> 00:46:31.075
And then maybe do a little bit of chatting together too.

00:46:31.756 --> 00:46:33.858
Thank you!

00:46:33.878 --> 00:46:35.479
That's our brand new week coming up!

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:38.765
A lot of things to look forward to!

00:46:38.965 --> 00:46:41.910
We'll do our best to care!

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:42.331
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:46:43.413 --> 00:46:51.887
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... It's BAU BAU Ball Game!

00:46:51.907 --> 00:46:53.029

00:46:53.009 --> 00:46:56.496

Thank you so much for being such a nice day for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:47:09.563 --> 00:47:16.953
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:47:16.973 --> 00:47:17.674

00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:57.125
Stay home!

00:47:57.425 --> 00:47:58.808
BAU BAU!

00:47:59.169 --> 00:48:07.865
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:10.189
This is today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.455
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:48:13.475 --> 00:48:15.458
BAU BAU!

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.502
Are you laughing at me?

00:48:17.522 --> 00:48:17.903
Yes.

00:48:17.923 --> 00:48:18.484
BAU BAU!
