00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.590
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.625
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.528
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:24.551
BAU BAU!

00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.414
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:31.076
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:33.158
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:34.319
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:40.336
BAU BAU-chan, you're singing.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.720
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.081
Ruffians!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:53.444
Today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.225
BAU BAU!

00:05:55.546 --> 00:06:00.569
Thank you for waking up early and for joining us today for our 72nd episode!

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:01.329
BAU BAU!

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:08.613
I get it why Moco-chan always says things wrong.

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:11.240
70 seconds doesn't sound right.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.844
That's too big of a number, no?

00:06:14.013 --> 00:06:14.553
I agree.

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:20.396
Thank you for being here with us this morning, Ruffians!

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:24.859
And for Ruffians who maybe, you're waking up for the first time!

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.621
And joining us, uh, waking up for the first time!

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.882
To join us for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:34.604
Today is the first morning!

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:37.225
Not like that.

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:38.546
Not like that.

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:39.847
Happy birthday!

00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:43.265
BAU!

00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:50.092
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:06:50.572 --> 00:06:51.793
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:56.198
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:57.058 --> 00:07:02.879
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:08.660
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:13.401
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:13.822 --> 00:07:16.962
BAU BAU!

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:19.523
Now Ruffians, you didn't know, but...

00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:21.804
Happy birthday!

00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:23.385
It's your first morning.

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:32.710
Or the alternative is that maybe there's some vampiric Ruffians out there and this is the first morning they're spending with us.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.911
Huh?

00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:40.515
Like vampires, they don't live... Vampires don't live in the morning time, Moco-chan.

00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:46.899
That's weird.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.120
I don't think we have any vampire Ruffians.

00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:53.535
So it's a key!

00:07:53.695 --> 00:08:02.827
Well... I... Maybe you wanna be a vampire!

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:15.362
Because... It might be handy... Since there was another Pero Sighting... Be handy if you're a vampire!

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:16.884
Then you could...

00:08:19.184 --> 00:08:44.905
You could... drink up... Pero... blood? That's not what I was thinking. I was just thinking "maybe Pero is afraid of vampires." But I guess if you wanna have Pero's blood. It's basically a juice box. I guess anything's a juice box if you're a vampire but---

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:46.409
Pero Sighting! De-den! Oh!

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:54.991
Did, uh... Did something happen when you were downloading some DLC for The Sims?

00:08:58.192 --> 00:09:00.772
Are you sure this is what you wanted?

00:09:02.413 --> 00:09:07.154
It looks kinda cool, but... Yeah, there's a lot of cool Sims stuff, right?

00:09:07.374 --> 00:09:10.634
Pero looks... pretty angry here, huh?

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:17.080
You didn't do something that maybe warranted this.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.400
Right?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.520
Ha!

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:27.022
Well, but, you know, Sims can be really fun, you know.

00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:32.023
You can be really creative, but it's kinda good just as it is too, right?

00:09:32.563 --> 00:09:36.264
You know, maybe that's why Pero's upset, you know.

00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:41.086
He maybe just wants you to enjoy the base game just as it is, you know?

00:09:41.126 --> 00:09:44.247
Like rice without toppings, you know?

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:54.609
You know the rice is delicious, but if you put a bunch of things on top, then you might miss out on the complicated flavors that the rice has to offer.

00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:57.529
Yeah, complicated flavors of the rice.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.690
Get it?

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.210
You get it right.

00:10:00.988 --> 00:10:04.272
I know recently Kiara-senpai and Nerissa, they play The Sims.

00:10:04.713 --> 00:10:06.395
And I look pretty fine, huh?

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:07.076
It did.

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:08.538
Huh.

00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:11.922
Is that why Awaken learns to play The Sims on you, maybe?

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:16.747
I kind of felt something a bit too low.

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:18.468
Not allowed.

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:21.210
BAU BAU!

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.853
Well, I guess good luck trying to fix things now, huh?

00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:26.314
Good luck!

00:10:27.574 --> 00:10:29.236
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.659
That would be really scary to have on your computer all the time.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.841
You just wake it up and Pero's there!

00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:38.682
But it's trapped, right?

00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:40.303
Pero's always moving, right?

00:10:40.443 --> 00:10:43.265
So... Maybe he's trapped, but temporarily.

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:44.746
Temporarily, huh?

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:50.788
Well, on the topic of temporary... Ruffians!

00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:59.791
For a while there, we really weren't sure about this one.

00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:08.934
But... It looks like finally... FUWAMOCO!

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:13.435
We're able to log into the EMPOWER server!

00:11:14.438 --> 00:11:16.580
BAU BAU!

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.483
You know, we had so much fun playing with Advent last week.

00:11:20.503 --> 00:11:23.026
And we really wanted to play it again.

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:28.570
But you know, it seems like there's a number of server issues and we just couldn't log in.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.271
We couldn't.

00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:37.238
Yeah, but you know, it can't really be helped because it's just such an explosively popular game right now.

00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:38.239
It makes sense.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.580
It happens.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.941
But, uh, well we mentioned it earlier, right?

00:11:43.062 --> 00:11:44.922
But... Now!

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.803
Officially!

00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:49.825
We will be playing Power World on Thursday!

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:50.965
On Thursday.

00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:51.686
Yeah.

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:54.087
So... Sorry, Bread and Fred.

00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:55.608
BAU BAU.

00:11:55.908 --> 00:12:00.810
We couldn't play Bread and Fred, but... We'll see you again sometime soon.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.491
It'll happen in the future.

00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:04.472
Bread and Fred will be there.

00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:04.972
Yeah.

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:05.853
For Power World.

00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:06.913
Power World.

00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:07.874
Power World.

00:12:09.113 --> 00:12:15.816
We hope that we can catch a lot of the cute pals and figure out some of the main mysteries, you know, of the game.

00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:22.220
Maybe we can play with some of our senpai too!

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.282
There's a lot we still have to learn, but I'm looking forward to it!

00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:29.944
Now we don't have to be envious and go to Mana-chan.

00:12:30.364 --> 00:12:32.625
Mana-chan, I want to play POWER.

00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:36.202
Can we play Power Up?

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.022
I wanna play Power Up.

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:39.423
Use the puppy dog eyes.

00:12:39.823 --> 00:12:41.584
Power Up.

00:12:41.624 --> 00:12:42.104
Please.

00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:43.064
Right!

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:48.667
We're looking forward to it on Thursday!

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.008
BAU BAU!

00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:53.429
BAU BAU!

00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:56.570
Exciting, right, Ruffians?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.732
Well, you know we're talking about all the mysteries of our world, but...

00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:06.119
There's been some other mysteries we've been dealing with, huh?

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:07.621
There has been.

00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:18.375
Well, Ruffians, do you remember that one FUWAMOCO Morning where our audio was suddenly very different from how it was beforehand?

00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:18.936
Do you?

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:23.419
Yeah.

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:26.040
It was really surprising for us.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.101
It was!

00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:28.041
Yeah.

00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:38.325
Ever since then, you know, we've been having some weird audio issues where everything is rather subdued in volume compared to our older streams.

00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:39.666
Yeah.

00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:43.647
Really, really, really, we absolutely didn't touch anything.

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:43.707
No!

00:13:44.168 --> 00:13:47.389
But something somewhere must have gone funny.

00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:49.230
Yeah.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.150
But,

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:52.006
Finally!

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:52.907
Finally!

00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:59.129
It seems like things might be a little better now.

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:00.130
Yeah.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.570
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.030
Huh?

00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:03.151
Huh?

00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:07.232
Is it a little bit more like what it used to be closer to debut?

00:14:07.432 --> 00:14:08.373
BAU BAU.

00:14:08.693 --> 00:14:09.553
BAU BAU!

00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:10.634
BAU BAU!

00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:11.594
Yeah.

00:14:11.694 --> 00:14:14.995
We tried really hard to figure out the mystery causing the issue.

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:15.576
Yeah.

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:18.397
But we're still not sure what happened.

00:14:19.605 --> 00:14:21.207
But you know, as long as it's better!

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.369
Right!

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:23.370
It sounds the same!

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.275
The same as... Older streams.

00:14:29.678 --> 00:14:30.479
BAU!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.441
You know...

00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:35.659
That is two of us, and you know, we've talked about that.

00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:40.522
Because of that, things are really different for us compared to our senpai.

00:14:41.023 --> 00:14:44.946
And, well, that can be really inconvenient sometimes.

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:47.948
You know, there's no one we can go to for help.

00:14:48.348 --> 00:14:49.769
No Mane-chan.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:50.530
Yeah.

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:51.947
BAU BAU.

00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:57.131
But, you know, so because of that, you know, we just have to do our best.

00:14:57.151 --> 00:14:59.173
We gotta do our absolute best.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:08.601
And you know, part of that, a big part of that is definitely try not to play around with things unnecessarily when they're working.

00:15:09.282 --> 00:15:09.602
Yeah.

00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:10.243
Yeah.

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:10.883
Yeah.

00:15:11.384 --> 00:15:14.406
The whole thing has been a bit of an ordeal.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:14.687
Yeah.

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.940
Let us know if you think it's better, okay, Ruffians?

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.381
We didn't do anything.

00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:25.402
We didn't do anything.

00:15:25.462 --> 00:15:26.183
It's fixed, though.

00:15:26.763 --> 00:15:28.304
It is fixed.

00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:28.784
Right.

00:15:30.525 --> 00:15:36.069
Well, we're always looking to improve, so... BAU BAU!

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.832
It is better.

00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:41.593
It's probably good.

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:44.775
Everyone has different ears, you know.

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:45.675
Right?

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:46.376
But...

00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:53.746
Well, we're gonna do our best to find something that works for as many Ruffians as possible.

00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:54.747
It might break again.

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:55.848
It might break again.

00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:57.670
It's a mystery, we don't know why.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.052
It's still a mystery!

00:16:00.572 --> 00:16:03.675
But Ruffians will actually...

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.682
Something a bit surprising yesterday.

00:16:10.702 --> 00:16:19.869
You know, we had a members stream where we tidied up our download folder and we chatted about a bunch of different things.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:33.080
And, well, this time we got a little passionate about, well... Maybe something we shouldn't have.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.601
Something...

00:16:36.274 --> 00:16:38.956
Well, our opinions on food.

00:16:39.977 --> 00:16:47.143
Somehow, we ended up talking about what is the most delicious part of the leaf of lettuce.

00:16:47.844 --> 00:16:48.625
Quite in-depth.

00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:49.105
In-depth!

00:16:49.646 --> 00:16:50.146
Yum!

00:16:50.226 --> 00:16:50.626
I know.

00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:53.329
We wanted to apologize.

00:16:55.568 --> 00:16:58.530
You know, Zatsudan... Just chatting and whatnot.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.314
Yeah, it's definitely something you know when you talk about a lot of different things.

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:12.582
But, talking about things like this... I don't know if that's acceptable, Ruffians.

00:17:13.623 --> 00:17:17.647
So, we wanted to say that we're sorry.

00:17:18.649 --> 00:17:20.690
We're sorry for talking about lettuce.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.151
Yeah.

00:17:21.731 --> 00:17:26.514
We'll make sure that we're talking about more wordy topics in the future.

00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:33.679
And not about how the deep green of the chlorophyll tastes delicious like the taste of fresh nature.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:34.039
Yeah.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.220
Yeah.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.100
Not that stuff.

00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:36.661
No.

00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:44.146
And we'll also make sure not to hate on nice breakfast foods like cereal or pancakes either.

00:17:44.526 --> 00:17:45.467
Right, Moco-chan?

00:17:50.234 --> 00:17:51.214
I'll do my best.

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:57.338
You know, I definitely don't feel passionate when it comes to breakfast foods, okay?

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:05.962
That means you do though, right?

00:18:06.023 --> 00:18:08.244
BAU BAU!

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:09.965
Not natto.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:11.806
Ah, not natto.

00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:12.066
No.

00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:14.927
BAU BAU!

00:18:14.947 --> 00:18:17.769
This is my apology.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.764
We just apologized!

00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:34.952
Apology accepted!

00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:39.493
Thank you!

00:18:39.613 --> 00:18:40.493
Ruffians!

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:45.655
Okay, this is silly, but we have something to talk about.

00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:45.755
Okay?

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:50.517
Sometimes, in the hololive reddit,

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.659
Do you have any clue what it could be, Ruffians?

00:19:12.912 --> 00:19:12.952
Hi.

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.073
Oh no, Scarlet.

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:16.893
I'm asking you a question.

00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:17.773
You stay put.

00:19:19.334 --> 00:19:21.594
You are being interrogated right now.

00:19:21.674 --> 00:19:22.755
You stay here.

00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:23.455
Hi.

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:28.136
I'm not seeing any answers.

00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:28.736
Hi.

00:19:30.677 --> 00:19:34.238
Well, I'll just have to tell you then, hi.

00:19:34.338 --> 00:19:34.578
Wow.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:52.092
It seems like some Ruffians think that we have some kind of method or complicated system behind the times when we accidentally think what we say.

00:19:53.513 --> 00:19:54.453
Except, no.

00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:57.634
They don't think it's an accident thing.

00:19:58.294 --> 00:20:01.714
They think that it's coordinated, okay?

00:20:03.255 --> 00:20:08.556
I, Ruffians, you do realize that

00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:11.995
It's embarrassing for us.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:16.117
We honestly don't try to say things at the same time.

00:20:16.137 --> 00:20:23.443
We definitely don't plan for it or have a system or use things like hand signals or anything like that to do that.

00:20:24.083 --> 00:20:25.064
That's so silly!

00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:26.705
Think about what you're saying!

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.485
Right!

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:29.287
Right!

00:20:30.107 --> 00:20:34.631
Yeah, I know, you know, it might be hard because you don't have a twin.

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.251
I'm sorry.

00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:37.052
Yeah, I'm sorry to break it to you.

00:20:37.072 --> 00:20:38.673
It just, it just happens.

00:20:38.994 --> 00:20:39.654
You know?

00:20:40.495 --> 00:20:45.939
It's actually harder for us to sync up if we're trying to count down to sync at the same time.

00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.480
Like, okay Moco-chan.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.561
Three, two, one.

00:20:49.762 --> 00:20:53.885
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:56.306
See, it's better like... We are FUWAMOCO!

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:05.821
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:07.801
Also doesn't help that we're laughing, huh?

00:21:08.061 --> 00:21:09.622
Ah, laughing doesn't help, huh?

00:21:09.882 --> 00:21:11.062
But you see!

00:21:11.723 --> 00:21:12.483
Yeah.

00:21:12.603 --> 00:21:17.124
You know, I think for us, we're just used to how each other breathes.

00:21:17.325 --> 00:21:18.785
And then from there it's easy.

00:21:18.805 --> 00:21:21.026
Does that make sense?

00:21:21.686 --> 00:21:22.446
Right.

00:21:22.586 --> 00:21:26.107
Maybe it's just that our breathing and our speech patterns are similar?

00:21:26.468 --> 00:21:29.649
Point proven.

00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:30.289
Yeah.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.091
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:32.692
BAU BAU!

00:21:44.991 --> 00:21:48.393
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:09.884
We know how each other's brains work, and we know what will come up next.

00:22:10.805 --> 00:22:11.525
All right.

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:15.429
Nerissa, you want to sync up with FUWAMOCO?

00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:17.050
Have we known already?

00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:19.752
I made a sync up.

00:22:20.853 --> 00:22:21.113
Huh?

00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:22.494
I did.

00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:23.455
Yeah.

00:22:24.236 --> 00:22:29.200
But I did a video editing.

00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:30.881
Oh.

00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:31.822
You will be the triplet!

00:22:33.425 --> 00:22:43.058
Well, Ruffians, you know, I know it's weird and maybe it's hard to understand, so we're sorry, okay?

00:22:43.398 --> 00:22:47.844
But you know, this is just what being a twin is about.

00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:49.146
It's a part of it.

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.367
At least for us.

00:22:51.325 --> 00:22:51.845
Got it!

00:22:51.865 --> 00:22:56.949
Yeah, we definitely don't plan to say things like a whole sentence together.

00:22:56.969 --> 00:23:03.173
I think one time we synced up talking about parts of an anison sandwich.

00:23:04.654 --> 00:23:07.716
That is not something we planned to do!

00:23:08.276 --> 00:23:09.617
You didn't really talk about it.

00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:13.980
One side being one part of an anison sandwich.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.401
It doesn't happen.

00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:16.442
Okay?

00:23:17.862 --> 00:23:18.203
It's just...

00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:20.461
Something, okay?

00:23:22.002 --> 00:23:24.403
Maybe it's just FUWAMOCO being FUWAMOCO.

00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:24.843
Sorry!

00:23:25.843 --> 00:23:30.825
BAU BAU!

00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:31.945
BAU!

00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:33.306
Is it silly?

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:36.007
It's just FUWAMOCO.

00:23:36.427 --> 00:23:38.048
Ruffians!

00:23:38.508 --> 00:23:42.349
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've been working pretty hard this week.

00:23:42.969 --> 00:23:46.331
And I think that you've been working even harder too.

00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:54.011
You know, maybe it's been a little rough, so... Moco-chan!

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:59.453
Do you have anything that you could say to make it a little less rough for the Ruffians?

00:24:02.054 --> 00:24:02.394
Well...

00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:08.907
Ruffians!

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.208
It's today!

00:24:11.748 --> 00:24:21.094
Today is the day again where it's time to listen up because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:24:21.874 --> 00:24:24.075
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:25.416
Mococo!

00:24:27.957 --> 00:24:29.158
Ruffians!

00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:30.919
Hi there.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.560
Good morning!

00:24:38.188 --> 00:24:39.469
How are you feeling today?

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.130
Uh-uh.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.851
A bit tired.

00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:47.151
Good morning.

00:24:49.212 --> 00:24:49.873
Sleepy?

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:52.534
Well, you know.

00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:54.594
That makes sense.

00:24:55.355 --> 00:24:59.356
You know, you keep on working so hard every day!

00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:05.859
I think sometimes it's hard to see yourself improving and growing little by little.

00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:10.755
But if you focus, you know, it's there!

00:25:11.515 --> 00:25:12.275
I know it is!

00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:18.056
You're moving forward each and every day thanks to the effort of your own hard work.

00:25:19.216 --> 00:25:26.938
And even though not many people might recognize your efforts, you know that in your heart, you're doing it.

00:25:27.718 --> 00:25:29.218
And I do too, okay?

00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:31.759
So just continue to do your best,

00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:38.452
Just believe in your process, and I'm sure it'll all work out, okay?

00:25:39.794 --> 00:25:45.359
And you know, if one door does close, another door will open.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.265
Believe in yourself and all your strengths, because you're amazing!

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:52.586
I know you are.

00:25:52.606 --> 00:25:54.308
Fuwawa knows you are.

00:25:54.328 --> 00:25:58.312
And even Pero, he knows too.

00:25:59.989 --> 00:26:01.412
Everything is gonna be okay.

00:26:02.013 --> 00:26:03.896
Even if it's a bit rough right now, okay?

00:26:04.657 --> 00:26:05.258
You can do it.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.102
Ganbatte de!

00:26:07.162 --> 00:26:08.745
BAU BAU!

00:26:14.134 --> 00:26:15.574
You can do it, Moco!

00:26:15.614 --> 00:26:17.015
It's okay!

00:26:17.395 --> 00:26:19.436
BAU BAU!

00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:24.738
Well, let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan.

00:26:25.398 --> 00:26:29.440
Today's Doggie of the Day is... BAU BAU!

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.180
Morning!

00:26:32.621 --> 00:26:33.542
Birdie!

00:26:33.702 --> 00:26:36.524
Kinda sounds like body.

00:26:36.564 --> 00:26:37.885
Birdie's my body.

00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:42.708
Look at those ears too!

00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:46.450
The ears are big like mine.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.912
What is Birdie looking at though?

00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:51.673
See, that's a deep mystery.

00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:53.475
Ruffians!

00:26:53.555 --> 00:26:55.176
Mysterious Deep Eyes.

00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:57.918
Do you have any ideas what birdie's looking at?

00:26:58.058 --> 00:26:59.299
She's looking at a birdie.

00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.620
At a birdie?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.020
No.

00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:01.441
Huh?

00:27:01.961 --> 00:27:03.462
A demon of sound birdie?

00:27:03.502 --> 00:27:04.183
Or... Whoa.

00:27:05.063 --> 00:27:06.084
G-g-ghost!

00:27:06.765 --> 00:27:07.365
Ghost!

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:07.866
Ghost!

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:09.387
A-a train?

00:27:10.287 --> 00:27:11.348
I don't know.

00:27:11.648 --> 00:27:12.209
Hello.

00:27:12.469 --> 00:27:13.710
Looking at FUWAMOCO!

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.112
With those eyes.

00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:17.193
Hi.

00:27:21.154 --> 00:27:22.674
A bug?

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:26.095
Maybe like a stink bug?

00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:30.336
I don't like that.

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:32.556
That one makes sense.

00:27:33.017 --> 00:27:36.297
Wow, Moco-chan, how does birdie BAU BAU?

00:27:36.317 --> 00:27:38.938
I think birdie goes...

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:50.753
Wow, I was thinking the exact same BAU BAU.

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:51.815
A bit white.

00:27:53.077 --> 00:27:54.960
A little bit BAU BAU.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.104
A bit... Scary.

00:27:58.545 --> 00:27:59.246
Yeah.

00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:03.152
Sounds a bit scary.

00:28:03.192 --> 00:28:06.817
Well, you know, when there's a deep mystery in front of you.

00:28:06.897 --> 00:28:08.660
Right, it can be a bit spooky.

00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:09.277
BAU BAU

00:28:10.137 --> 00:28:14.980
Well, you know, Birdie is an absolute cutie.

00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.324
Also, maybe has a bit of a lazy side sometimes.

00:28:19.424 --> 00:28:20.144
That's okay.

00:28:20.484 --> 00:28:25.208
Yeah, but that's okay because Birdie just wants to snuggle up with you.

00:28:25.508 --> 00:28:27.729
It's okay to be lazy if you're gonna snuggle.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.090
Yeah.

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:31.495
Is it awkward?

00:28:42.752 --> 00:28:45.033
It's only awkward if you wanted to be Ruffians.

00:28:47.013 --> 00:28:48.734
Well, it's okay.

00:28:49.054 --> 00:28:51.115
Because birdie is cute.

00:28:51.235 --> 00:28:51.595
Yeah.

00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:52.375
Yeah.

00:28:53.075 --> 00:28:53.695
It's okay.

00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:54.575
It's forgiven.

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.236
Because birdie is cute.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.497
BAU BAU!

00:29:01.957 --> 00:29:03.718
What do you mean ha?

00:29:03.818 --> 00:29:04.338
What?

00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:05.318
It makes sense.

00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:07.079
The logic is there.

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.749
Thank you, birdie.

00:29:23.226 --> 00:29:24.467
We learned a lot today.

00:29:25.408 --> 00:29:26.589
BAU BAU!

00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:27.470
BAU BAU!

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:32.254
Well, next we have... Today I went on a walk!

00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:35.757
And we have... De-den!

00:29:35.777 --> 00:29:40.240
Oh my gosh!

00:29:40.881 --> 00:29:43.803
That's both beautiful and super cold!

00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:48.027
I can feel the cold air rushing through my body just looking at this!

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:49.889
That's the sound.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.473
But the trees look so pretty too!

00:29:56.953 --> 00:30:01.236
We hope you had a wonderful walk and or ski!

00:30:02.097 --> 00:30:07.620
Is this also another time where it's okay to be lazy if we're going to cuddle?

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.901
Because it's chilly!

00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:14.485
Oh, well, you should probably find somewhere like a lodge or something with a

00:30:16.337 --> 00:30:18.579
What are you imagining now, huh?

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.083
Moco-chan, you suggested we snuggle in the snow.

00:30:22.103 --> 00:30:26.127
I was just thinking.

00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:31.812
Well, thank you for sharing your view with us too!

00:30:31.832 --> 00:30:32.453
BAU BAU!

00:30:34.094 --> 00:30:37.337
I don't know snuggling in the snow is the safest idea.

00:30:37.498 --> 00:30:38.378
A snow cave.

00:30:41.352 --> 00:30:47.414
Well, our Question of the Day we have... De-den!

00:30:47.914 --> 00:30:52.816
During the reveal, Fuwawa let us know that the New Year outfits have paw beans.

00:30:52.856 --> 00:30:54.416
We do, we have paw beans!

00:30:54.456 --> 00:31:03.219
Yeah, it feels nice squishing cats' or dogs' beans, so I wanted to ask, is it okay to touch FUWAMOCO's paw beans?

00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:07.940
Touch our beans.

00:31:13.894 --> 00:31:15.315
Only when we say it's okay.

00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:15.896
Okay.

00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:17.177
Permission.

00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:24.284
But actually, you know, it would be really nice to get a hand massage.

00:31:24.905 --> 00:31:25.605
Right?

00:31:26.086 --> 00:31:28.769
Sometimes you see them on TV, right?

00:31:28.869 --> 00:31:30.430
It's so fancy and all!

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.112
A little aggressive, no?

00:31:32.152 --> 00:31:32.492
Why?

00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:41.321
Take your heart and go... No, resting the paw is softening the bean.

00:31:41.401 --> 00:31:44.304
It sounds good right now, too hot.

00:31:44.665 --> 00:31:44.985
But!

00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:46.847
Only when we say so.

00:31:46.927 --> 00:31:47.768
Got it!

00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:52.849
BAU BAU!

00:31:52.869 --> 00:32:02.029
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions, for always being a big part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:05.957
Please don't forget, we want to see what walks you're going on.

00:32:06.398 --> 00:32:09.143
We want your burning questions.

00:32:09.204 --> 00:32:12.330
Please let us know what doggies you've been seeing.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.813
Who's your doggie?

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:19.845
And, well, if you happen to see Pero, you should probably report it. Report the Sighting to us.

00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:28.094
We're always waiting so please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING and journalism.

00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:28.895
Ruffians.

00:32:29.395 --> 00:32:31.196
FUWAMOCO Scoop, okay?

00:32:31.536 --> 00:32:32.257
Don't forget.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:37.961
And as for our next stream, we have...

00:32:39.482 --> 00:32:40.944
De-den!

00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:43.527
Surprise!

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:55.303
Well, we don't have a stream on our channel tonight, but we'll be seeing you over on the official hololive English YouTube channel with some very important information.

00:32:56.684 --> 00:33:02.371
Upcoming hololive Expo and Fifth Fest Capture the Moment!

00:33:02.792 --> 00:33:04.454
Are you excited, Ruffians?

00:33:05.194 --> 00:33:07.317
I'm so excited!

00:33:07.377 --> 00:33:12.143
But there will be some more details as well as some cool news revealed!

00:33:12.744 --> 00:33:15.687
And it will all be in English, so please join us for it, okay?

00:33:16.568 --> 00:33:20.269
It'll be a lot of fun together with Ina-senpai and Rin-senpai!

00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:21.289
I'm excited!

00:33:21.309 --> 00:33:24.610
Don't forget, okay?

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.711
Just because it's not on FUWAMOCO's channel, okay?

00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:28.631
BAU BAU!

00:33:28.771 --> 00:33:32.232
And for our schedule!

00:33:32.292 --> 00:33:35.672
Let's take a little peek here.

00:33:36.232 --> 00:33:38.753
Well, like we mentioned, bread and bread.

00:33:39.153 --> 00:33:41.935
Has been bumped by power.

00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:47.340
So on Thursday we'll be exploring the EN server for the very first time.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:54.005
And also be aware that inside the back rooms in Advent on Friday is now at 4pm PT.

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:58.208
So it is two hours earlier than usual.

00:33:58.729 --> 00:34:00.090
Don't be surprised, okay?

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.793
And I'm sitting on the middle chair so it's also two hours earlier than usual.

00:34:04.153 --> 00:34:06.074
It's a bit earlier this week, okay?

00:34:07.534 --> 00:34:09.475
Just remember, gotta be early.

00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:12.516
Gotta be early, gotta be early, okay?

00:34:13.796 --> 00:34:16.237
We'll make sure to be early and brief.
