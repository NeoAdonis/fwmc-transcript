00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:11.996
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:16.390
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:21.528
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.293
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:28.177
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:29.879
BAU BAU!

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.606
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:35.966
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.528
And today- Huh?

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:39.711
We're also looking at cats right before this.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.742
Right before this.

00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:45.786
But now we're looking at you, Ruffians!

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:51.133
Thank you for joining us for our one hundred and fifty-fifth.

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:51.514
Yes!

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:52.255
Fifty-fifth episode!

00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:54.458
What's that?

00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:57.823
I told you, Moco-chan, it's getting harder to count, okay?

00:05:58.283 --> 00:05:58.604
It's not, okay.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:05:59.305
You just have to be prepared.

00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:03.350
A hundred and fifty-fifth is not that hard.

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:05.954
Get over it.

00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:06.154
BAU BAU!

00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:18.370
Wow, for Ruffians that are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:20.513
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.417
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:29.425
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:35.716
So, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:40.044
Let's do a BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:43.710
BAU BAU!

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.535
The smiles on your face are very obvious!

00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:47.417
What did you just say?

00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:50.502
The smiles on your face...

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.863
Wow, we're still gonna do our best here, okay?

00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:55.685
Ah, nothing is wrong with the left paw.

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:56.225
No.

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:58.547
You just only know the right paw.

00:06:58.647 --> 00:06:59.688
On a happy note.

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:00.289
Happy note.

00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:02.351
Yeah.

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:04.173
BAU BAU!

00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:04.453
BAU BAU!

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:08.357
Well, you know, we're just about here at the weekend!

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:08.697
Yay!

00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:09.478
Exciting things.

00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:12.160
One weekend is right before us.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:18.987
Nothing's in our way, right, Moco-chan?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.943
There's one thing.

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:24.687
One thing?

00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:25.709
Let's get rid of it then.

00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:27.292
What is it?

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:32.281
A Pero sighting?

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.625
Another Pero sighting.

00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:36.850
Mobius, there's been a Pero sighting!

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.713
Are you worried about Pero safety?

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:43.640
Abyss, this is all about your safety, okay?

00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:44.681
Huh?

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:49.028
I know you care, but I think your heart is in the wrong place.

00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:50.870
Don't go back to bed, okay?

00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.635
Rip the band-aid off, you wanna know?

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:54.316
Let's take a look.

00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:56.279
Where was Pero seen, Moco-chan?

00:07:58.462 --> 00:07:58.622
De-den!

00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:02.608
A terrifying sight.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.984
Oh my gosh, Ruffians, be careful!

00:08:07.324 --> 00:08:08.546
You might break your games!

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:10.689
You don't crush your controllers!

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.354
You gotta get them out of there, okay?

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:19.020
But, uh, he's playing a racing game.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.123
A racing game?

00:08:21.143 --> 00:08:24.828
Is this perhaps because Pero can't drive a car?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.756
Maybe it comes from a longing to be behind the wheel.

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:39.409
Or, you know, maybe he just had too much fun playing F-Zero 99 together with the Ruffians, you know, like he did the one time.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.117
Maybe he's just trying to, you know, live back the memories again.

00:08:43.157 --> 00:08:46.905
Playing a driving game.

00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:49.314
He can play?

00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.117
He played with you before, Ruffians.

00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:56.185
But Ruffians, you know, either way, you have to be careful.

00:08:56.265 --> 00:09:00.191
Make sure this doesn't happen to you when you visit the washroom at night, okay?

00:09:00.251 --> 00:09:03.657
No, also don't, when it's a dark room, you shouldn't be that close to the monitor.

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:04.638
That too.

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:05.680
It's not safe.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.781
Not good for your eyes.

00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:09.065
We don't need to worry about Pero, you know?

00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:10.647
He can have bad eyesight.

00:09:10.688 --> 00:09:12.771
But you, you need good eyesight, okay?

00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:13.672
Let him play!

00:09:13.712 --> 00:09:15.475
Don't bother him!

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.777
It's a bother!

00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:19.020
I'll be careful.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.502
Tap tap tap.

00:09:20.522 --> 00:09:22.185
Tap tap tap.

00:09:22.926 --> 00:09:23.867
Mr. Pero!

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:31.879
You know, I wouldn't want to interrupt your game, but I think you should take a few steps back from the screen.

00:09:33.802 --> 00:09:34.563
It's not for me!

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:36.706
It's for your sake, okay?

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:38.970
Is bothering Pero safe?

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:41.934
You have to do it very carefully because you don't know the outcome.

00:09:42.235 --> 00:09:43.376
You have to be ready, okay?

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:45.259
Ready for the worst case outcome.

00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:47.727
You already have bad eyesight.

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:49.690
That means you got a prize.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.333
You get to wear cute glasses.

00:09:51.413 --> 00:09:53.536
But you also need to protect them more, okay?

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:58.304
BAU BAU!

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:00.627
The games are yours, okay?

00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:05.174
Ruffians gotta protect them, okay?

00:10:05.194 --> 00:10:06.336
BAU BAU!

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.234
BAU BAU!

00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:09.015
Ruffians!

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:23.346
I heard that it's our turn to get

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:25.099
Pampered!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.604
Because we just released a new voice pack!

00:10:29.624 --> 00:10:30.365
Pampered!

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:32.388

00:10:43.922 --> 00:10:44.223

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:44.543
To be pampered!

00:10:44.563 --> 00:10:44.864
To be pampered!

00:10:44.884 --> 00:10:45.184
To be pampered!

00:10:45.204 --> 00:10:46.306
To be pampered!

00:10:46.326 --> 00:10:46.906
To be pampered!

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:47.227
To be pampered!

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:47.547
To be pampered!

00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:48.108

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:49.069

To be pampered

00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:57.878
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:03.505
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:03.765 --> 00:11:08.971
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:09.832 --> 00:11:14.919
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:18.143
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:23.910
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.433
In a very special situation.

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:29.557
Yes, it is a situation voice that we have recorded.

00:11:29.577 --> 00:11:30.859
Very immersive.

00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:32.281
Yes!

00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:34.483
You know, and we put our full hearts in it.

00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:34.643
Yeah!

00:11:34.804 --> 00:11:36.926
It's like a full, you know, drama scene.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:37.587
You know?

00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:39.690
Very immersive, like we said.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.874
And there's an English version and a Japanese version.

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:51.805
And, you know, I'm... I... You can't pound for me when I'm not feeling well and my tummy hurts and I have a headache and...

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:54.931
That was good, you really liked it.

00:11:57.755 --> 00:11:58.236
I got pampered!

00:11:58.256 --> 00:12:00.399
You got that!

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.361
Oh my!

00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:03.043
It's a little embarrassing.

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:06.349
But it's only digital, so.

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:06.769
Who's pampering who?

00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:10.775
This time we're getting pampered by you, Ruffians!

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:11.236
Got it!

00:12:15.483 --> 00:12:16.324
I know.

00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:21.450
But we always do our best, so I'd love it if you could check it out there, Ruffians!

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.196
You know, I hear that digital merchandise is popular right now.

00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:28.278
So maybe if you're like, yeah!

00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:30.400
Digital merchandise, yeah!

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:33.023
You can go check it out too.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:35.627
And if you're still kinda like, what exactly is this?

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:37.469
Please go take a listen!

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:38.650
I think you'll be surprised.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:46.427
We were listening to a bunch of the samples, you know, because we saw that, you know, I think some of our senpai, some of our kouhai did Japanese ones.

00:12:46.728 --> 00:12:47.910
Yeah!

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.917
Oh, it's so cute!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:51.197
It's so good!

00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:54.986
I was listening to Gigi sample a Japanese one of her voice plays.

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:57.231
It was so cute!

00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:57.351
Yeah!

00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.393
It was so...

00:12:58.373 --> 00:13:03.181
Please check it out, especially, you know, maybe other EN members are like, oh, I haven't heard them speak Japanese.

00:13:03.201 --> 00:13:06.326
If you like this voice pack, we have one for you as well!

00:13:06.527 --> 00:13:10.032
All digital, so.

00:13:10.052 --> 00:13:11.896
Please check it out on the camera, please!

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:12.997
Is Jiji Japanese cute?

00:13:13.017 --> 00:13:13.358
Yes!

00:13:13.378 --> 00:13:15.462
Very cute!

00:13:15.482 --> 00:13:16.263
Yes!

00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:17.906
Does Jiji also have a Japanese one as well?

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.348
I don't think so.

00:13:19.568 --> 00:13:21.932
I would've listened to that one, too.

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:22.373
Yeah, so.

00:13:22.353 --> 00:13:26.578
Please check them out!

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:26.778
BAU BAU!

00:13:26.798 --> 00:13:31.584
Now is the sweetest time to get a very sweet voice pack.

00:13:31.604 --> 00:13:36.751
I really like the little things that you prepared for me.

00:13:36.771 --> 00:13:40.235
I thought it was funny.

00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:42.478
BAU BAU!

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:42.758
Wow.

00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:45.130
It's been a big week!

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:50.359
With hololive English we've had a very big, big special project going on!

00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:55.688
hololive English Enigmatic Recollection Chapter 2!

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.072
A Minecraft Roleplaying Project!

00:13:58.092 --> 00:14:00.336
And slowly but surely it's coming to an end!

00:14:00.737 --> 00:14:05.185
Very exciting, dramatic, and you know...

00:14:05.418 --> 00:14:07.561
Kingdom of Lobesto.

00:14:08.663 --> 00:14:12.549
Maybe there's some Ruffians that are like, I wasn't able to catch the previous stage.

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:14.872
Do we have a summary, Moco-chan?

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:17.557
We did this last time.

00:14:17.977 --> 00:14:21.703
And Fuwawa said she's gonna try to summarize everything that's happened.

00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:23.846
Let's do it together, okay Ruffians?

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:27.612
And said, are you sure you think you know everything that has happened?

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.201
Definitely don't.

00:14:30.882 --> 00:14:35.149
Wow, the story goes that there is a kingdom called Lobesto.

00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:37.573
This is also right after chapter 1, just in case, just in case.

00:14:37.934 --> 00:14:39.176
Okay, she's gonna try her best.

00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:40.298
It's not accurate probably.

00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:43.182
And that is the king, the king, what's his name again?

00:14:43.242 --> 00:14:44.084
King Lobesto?

00:14:46.988 --> 00:14:47.890
King Lobesto!

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.135
And we have to get the memories.

00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:56.547
And then, then, in the end, you know, we get rid of the stains.

00:14:56.667 --> 00:15:02.197
That's the day.

00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:05.524
And then, you know, yes, stains, goodbye.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.988
But the king, the king is a stain.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.373
He's the king of stains.

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:26.033
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:28.223 --> 00:15:29.905
We go back in time!

00:15:29.925 --> 00:15:30.966
We go back in time!

00:15:30.986 --> 00:15:31.066
Yes!

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:33.749
And we meet a little mouse named Fia!

00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:34.670
No, Fia's a cat!

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.552
No she's a mouse, Moco-chan!

00:15:36.732 --> 00:15:37.553
Fia's a cat!

00:15:38.774 --> 00:15:42.398
And, uh, she's lost some of her memories and we're in each of the bustle!

00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:44.260
We travel to each of the bustle!

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.723
We're trying to figure out what is the outside.

00:15:46.763 --> 00:15:49.145
How can we find the outside and can we turn back time?

00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:50.286
Can we fix it?

00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:50.887
Can we fix it?

00:15:51.227 --> 00:15:52.729
And then there's...

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:54.532
Queen Yathania!

00:15:55.093 --> 00:16:00.160
And there's a prophecy that Ancient Labesso will be ruined.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.222
By the Ruination.

00:16:01.242 --> 00:16:02.183
By the Ruination.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:05.608
So you have to stop it and also get these memories back.

00:16:05.628 --> 00:16:06.710
We only have 7 days?

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.551
7 days!

00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:07.671
Yeah!

00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:08.873
7 days.

00:16:08.893 --> 00:16:14.361
And so we get memories of Fia's back and we kind of learn these memories.

00:16:14.521 --> 00:16:15.623
And there's the Outlander.

00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:17.165
But we learned that there's the Outlander.

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:17.546
Yes!

00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:19.889
And the Outlander is a great, great hero.

00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:20.870
Mysterious hero.

00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:21.231
But kind of

00:16:21.211 --> 00:16:24.375
And then we find out that the Outlander is the Outsider.

00:16:24.395 --> 00:16:27.018
And it's going to, or becomes the Outsider.

00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:31.364
It's going to start a prophecy and it's bad.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.908
But Infarnia maybe loves the Outlander?

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:37.051
We don't care because we're the Shining Stars.

00:16:37.812 --> 00:16:40.395
And so we beat the Outlander Outsider.

00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:43.659
We have to find the Escapist?

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.340
What?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.620
I don't know.

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.394
We are making it up.

00:16:47.414 --> 00:16:51.560
But we show, we show that we're strong!

00:16:51.781 --> 00:16:54.144
But in the meantime, what has been going on?

00:16:54.164 --> 00:17:06.642
There has been a lot of drama, and of relationships, and of betrayal.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.714
And some of us might just be cooking.

00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:10.335
What else?

00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:12.920
Some of us might just be... Therapy!

00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:13.882
Yeah?

00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.185
What else has been going on?

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.452
Uh... Therapy.

00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:20.596
Boniton.

00:17:21.378 --> 00:17:21.999
Potatoes!

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.382
Potatoes!

00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:31.022
You never know what's going to happen once you look into child care.

00:17:31.883 --> 00:17:34.327
You never know what's going to happen.

00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:36.450
So please check it out.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.758
There is still a few days until Anorekko Chapter 2 comes to a big finale.

00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:47.026
So we hope that you'll join us at hololive English on the remaining journey.

00:17:47.186 --> 00:17:51.112
Adventure to adventure!

00:17:51.132 --> 00:17:51.393
To adventure!

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:51.613
BAU BAU!

00:17:51.593 --> 00:17:54.116
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:56.839
I don't think anyone expected this.

00:17:58.481 --> 00:17:58.802
FUWAMOCO!

00:18:00.183 --> 00:18:01.525
Do you think my summary was good?

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:04.549
Out of 10!

00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:05.129
Out of 10!

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.892
Rate the summary!

00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:09.054
Yeah.

00:18:09.074 --> 00:18:09.595
Out of 10.

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:14.841
That's just like you did it!

00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:15.923
FUWAMOCO!

00:18:15.943 --> 00:18:16.704
11 out of 10!

00:18:16.724 --> 00:18:17.945
I thought you got a 10!

00:18:18.526 --> 00:18:20.368
Is there any escapist?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.064
I think there was a mention of an escapist.

00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:27.672
The outsider, the outlander, the escapist.

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:30.057
Right!

00:18:30.398 --> 00:18:31.860
I'm not just adding something new.

00:18:33.243 --> 00:18:33.503
No escapist.

00:18:33.543 --> 00:18:34.245
The Watcher?

00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:38.833
I don't know who that is!

00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:40.376
It was the Watcher!

00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:42.981
Oh, okay.

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:44.200
I don't know.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.561
Both sound accurate.

00:18:46.622 --> 00:18:47.903
You don't know about the escapist?

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:48.944
Okay.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:51.406
BAU BAU!

00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.053
Just the other day too, it was a birthday!

00:19:00.594 --> 00:19:05.078
It was Harusaki Nozoko's birthday!

00:19:05.098 --> 00:19:07.200
There was something special that happened!

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.341
She debuted!

00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:13.305
A brand new debut on the whole ANA channel!

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:17.229
Did you check it out?

00:19:17.249 --> 00:19:18.030
Did you hear about it?

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.651
Maybe not.

00:19:21.234 --> 00:19:24.617
But you know, a very special event on her birthday.

00:19:24.637 --> 00:19:36.170
But you know, this kicks off a brand new, new show, new in Japan show that Nodoka, that she will be hosting called Hiruhoron.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.390
Hiruhoron!

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:53.333
It's once a week, and this way through Shiroholo you can understand what is going on in hololive, the big events, maybe the things you might have missed, and just a way to be able to cheer on everybody in hololive!

00:19:54.781 --> 00:20:04.056
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:09.966
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.498
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.004
FUWAMOCO!

00:20:22.024 --> 00:20:29.412
We'll continue doing our best with FUWAMOCO Morning too!

00:20:29.432 --> 00:20:29.592
BAU BAU!

00:20:29.612 --> 00:20:31.233
You have to check it out!

00:20:31.854 --> 00:20:32.895
Go check it out!

00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:33.436
Versus!

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.757
No versus!

00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:35.838
No rivalry!

00:20:35.858 --> 00:20:36.979
Just support, you know?

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:37.940
Support, you know?

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.984
Being able to spread the news and exciting things happening at hololive.

00:20:42.004 --> 00:20:43.926
It's just bonus, bonus, bonus, plus, plus, plus.

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:45.507
No minus.

00:20:46.308 --> 00:20:48.210
BAU BAU!

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.578
FUWAMOCO We had some happy news!

00:20:53.778 --> 00:20:55.721
Happy things happened to us!

00:20:55.741 --> 00:21:00.088
It's funny how happy things happen to you, huh?

00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:05.676
The other day we got an exciting notification!

00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:15.066
A certain Poruru-oneechan sent us a gift!

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:15.647
Thank you, Poruru-oneechan!

00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:16.028
Thank you!

00:21:16.048 --> 00:21:18.090
Look, I'm so fluffy and fuzzy now!

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.632
Look at the fluffy cow!

00:21:19.732 --> 00:21:25.599
I don't know what an avatar decoration is, but now I have one because Poruru-oneechan gave me one!

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:28.522
Yeah, and I'm gonna use it my entire life from now on!

00:21:29.744 --> 00:21:32.507
I did not get a photo of mine because I was too excited.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.355
I didn't notice that I got one for a little while.

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:41.604
I was like, oh, that's good for you, Moco-chan.

00:21:41.624 --> 00:21:45.992
But poor little onee-chan, she's a smart older sister and understands, you know.

00:21:46.232 --> 00:21:48.316
You have to be fair, otherwise.

00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:54.086
But apparently she sent so many GIFs that she got locked out of Discord.

00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:56.250
Discord got a little grumpy there, huh?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.124
Yeah, Kanata-senpai too.

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:01.307
She thought she was the only one to get a gift.

00:22:01.768 --> 00:22:05.713
No, Kanata-senpai, we also got one too, huh?

00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:06.595
You're not special.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.282
Yeah, no discord avatar.

00:22:11.302 --> 00:22:12.343
I don't get discord.

00:22:12.363 --> 00:22:14.466
It shows you that this is what you're getting.

00:22:14.807 --> 00:22:17.351
Yeah, I have a discord avatar.

00:22:17.691 --> 00:22:19.334
It has not changed once.

00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:22.298
Moco-chan, not changed once.

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:22.879
Yup.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.732
And this shall be the same.

00:22:25.772 --> 00:22:35.686
It will stay forever and ever because it's a special gift from Poruru-oneechan.

00:22:36.206 --> 00:22:38.409
Very special gift.

00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:44.658
Thank you, Poruru-oneechan!

00:22:44.758 --> 00:22:44.918
Present!

00:22:45.438 --> 00:22:46.921
FUWAMOCO, you do the same!

00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:49.186
You don't really change things up either!

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:49.587
What?

00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:52.112
If it's good, then why not type it?

00:22:52.193 --> 00:22:53.335
It's good, it's good, alright?

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:53.916
It's good, it's good.

00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:54.738
Good things are good.

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:55.660
Perfect.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.163
Yeah.

00:22:57.183 --> 00:22:59.268
FUWAMOCO, we match too!

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:00.310
Yay!

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.152
We're matching!

00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:03.115
BAU BAU!

00:23:04.056 --> 00:23:06.701
And other happy news!

00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:07.662
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:07.682 --> 00:23:09.986
Ruffians, you know how we like Twitter, right?

00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:16.095
Well, it just so happens that I think you like Twitter too because... No!

00:23:16.115 --> 00:23:24.368
We have over 500,000 followers on Twitter!

00:23:24.888 --> 00:23:25.890
Ruffians like Twitter!

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.116
Thank you, Abyss!

00:23:30.136 --> 00:23:31.818
You know, I really like Twitter.

00:23:31.838 --> 00:23:37.005
It's fun to be silly on Twitter and also see what kind of silly things you're getting up to, Ruffians, too.

00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:39.589
Apparently, I think we have a lot of tweets.

00:23:39.609 --> 00:23:40.290
Apparently?

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.952
I don't really think so.

00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:53.548
Although we do find, you know, the sillier the tweets get... The more free... freedom we feel, right?

00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:59.472
Nothing silly!

00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:02.620
But thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.993
We really, really like being able to, you know, have lots of fun on Twitter together, so... Lots of silly Twitter drafts.

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:20.287
Lots of silly drafts, you know, so... We hope to continue to have lots of fun together on Twitter, so... Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:24:20.928 --> 00:24:22.911
BAU BAU!

00:24:23.252 --> 00:24:26.657
More silly and needy tweets!

00:24:26.637 --> 00:24:28.940
More silly tweets, that's for sure!

00:24:31.123 --> 00:24:33.005
BAU BAU!

00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:34.607
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:24:34.627 --> 00:24:42.037
I'll try to keep the neediness to the voice back on.

00:24:42.778 --> 00:24:43.599
BAU BAU!

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:50.007
We also figured out something very important, basically.

00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:54.973
There's not a normal, you know, FUWAMOCO Morning type of stuff, but

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:59.396
We have a FUWAMOCO life hack for you.

00:25:00.197 --> 00:25:02.503
You know, I'm still a Ruffian.

00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:12.124
Sometimes, kind of like, all the interesting things happening on my phone, you know, Twitter, YouTube.

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:13.367
Like me, FUWAMOCO is streaming.

00:25:13.347 --> 00:25:34.680
De-den!

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:41.487
If you use a black and white mode, black and white filter, then your phone dies.

00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:42.429
It dies.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:43.371
It's dead.

00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:43.692
It's boring.

00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:44.393
It's dead.

00:25:44.454 --> 00:25:45.315
You can't use it.

00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:46.859
It's good for nothing.

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:48.803
Use a black and white filter.

00:25:48.843 --> 00:25:51.268
You know, isn't it exciting for the TBR?

00:25:52.531 --> 00:25:55.116
They're fun animals, that's for sure!

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:56.980
They're fun animals, they are in black and white mode.

00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:00.467
These animals are black and white mode, you know.

00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:04.695
FUWAMOCO, we're, you know, pink and blue.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:08.483
And maybe, you know, it kind of loses some of the fun.

00:26:09.886 --> 00:26:12.531
You can't tell what color everything is anymore!

00:26:13.304 --> 00:26:25.744
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:44.340
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:44.921 --> 00:26:51.090
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.733
It seems like, you know, the clock strikes this time.

00:26:55.354 --> 00:26:56.755
Oh no!

00:26:57.716 --> 00:27:01.539
Black and white.

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:05.123
I think you know it perfectly!

00:27:05.263 --> 00:27:09.907
And then that way, Ruffians, you can get an even better rest.

00:27:10.427 --> 00:27:19.035
I have a way of sleep before I need to look at the phone.

00:27:19.454 --> 00:27:23.423
So just a little life hack from my routine.

00:27:24.747 --> 00:27:27.634
A life hack from FUWAMOCO to you, FUWAMOCO routine!

00:27:27.654 --> 00:27:27.914
Check it out.

00:27:27.934 --> 00:27:28.095
BAU BAU!

00:27:28.275 --> 00:27:29.658
It makes really loud.

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:31.202
I just don't need it right now.

00:27:31.672 --> 00:27:35.716
BAU BAU!

00:27:36.337 --> 00:27:39.980
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today!

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.762
I wanna see the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:41.782 --> 00:27:44.725
We have De-den!

00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:51.151
Today's Doggie of the Day is Nico!

00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:52.072
BAU BAU!

00:27:52.092 --> 00:27:53.854
Nico!

00:27:53.954 --> 00:27:56.717
Somebody's having fun.

00:27:56.697 --> 00:28:02.047
Those teeth, too!

00:28:02.067 --> 00:28:02.768
The teeth are so shiny!

00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:04.872
Really white teeth.

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:08.158
We can tell Riko really loves to play.

00:28:08.298 --> 00:28:13.628
I can imagine Riko going like... Whipping his head side to side, side to side.

00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:16.513
But you're not gonna let it go!

00:28:17.135 --> 00:28:20.140
Because Riko will probably just hand it back to you, right?

00:28:20.947 --> 00:28:22.552
BAU BAU!

00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:23.736
Very cute!

00:28:23.816 --> 00:28:26.846
Moco-chan, how do we go BAU BAU?

00:28:28.772 --> 00:28:33.025
Probably like... BAU BAU!

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:33.326
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:34.028
BAU BAU!

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:46.040
Well you know, Riko looks like such a fun and loving puppy buddy.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.024
Always playing together, you know.

00:28:48.044 --> 00:28:50.448
Maybe even when you're like, right now is not the time to play.

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:51.830
The fun does not stop.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:52.872
Never stop.

00:28:53.413 --> 00:28:57.400
But you know, no matter how many years pass together,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.326
I think you know he's always happy to be your puppy.

00:29:00.346 --> 00:29:02.190
Let's play together!

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.653
Don't forget the playtime, okay?

00:29:03.874 --> 00:29:05.738
Don't forget the playtime.

00:29:05.758 --> 00:29:07.502
More consequences.

00:29:08.403 --> 00:29:09.045
Yeah.

00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:09.145
Bye!

00:29:10.222 --> 00:29:12.604
Thank you!

00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:15.587
Wow, let's take a look, Ruffians!

00:29:15.627 --> 00:29:19.190
You go out, take a walk, and let's see what you went out on today.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.251
I went on a walk.

00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:22.773
We have... De-den!

00:29:24.394 --> 00:29:25.095
What's this?

00:29:25.115 --> 00:29:26.536
A secret garden?

00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.978
Oh, it's an arch!

00:29:28.998 --> 00:29:30.560
An arch made of branches of vines.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.120
Tree arch.

00:29:31.581 --> 00:29:33.062
It's so cool.

00:29:33.602 --> 00:29:36.965
I'm wondering, you know, maybe somebody made it, or it didn't happen.

00:29:37.366 --> 00:29:39.908
I don't know, maybe nature just took its course.

00:29:39.888 --> 00:29:45.855
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:55.947
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:56.007 --> 00:29:57.469
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:08.562
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:09.284 --> 00:30:14.994
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:15.034 --> 00:30:19.362
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:30.482
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:31.945
Photoshoot time!

00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:32.246
Yes!

00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:33.168
Photoshoot time!

00:30:33.568 --> 00:30:39.520
Well hopefully you'll have those pretty dragonflies and the flowers to join you in the full adventure.

00:30:40.282 --> 00:30:43.689
BAU BAU!

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.232
Why is it such a cool walk?

00:30:45.252 --> 00:30:46.895
Yeah, that's what I love about walks.

00:30:46.915 --> 00:30:48.078
You never know what you're gonna find.

00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:50.142
Do you pass into another world?

00:30:51.337 --> 00:30:55.041
See ya!

00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:55.222
BAU BAU!

00:30:55.442 --> 00:30:58.846
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:01.949
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:04.352
Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:31:04.472 --> 00:31:08.797
How to stay energized through the day and start it on the right paw.

00:31:09.038 --> 00:31:12.822
Sometimes it's hard to stay positive or productive when you're tired.

00:31:12.802 --> 00:31:15.247
So I wonder if you have any special methods.

00:31:15.608 --> 00:31:17.652
Coffee salad never works.

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:19.315
It's okay!

00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:21.058
We totally get this!

00:31:21.078 --> 00:31:21.158
Yes!

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:25.788
You know, sometimes we lose speed when we get really sleepy.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.595
Yeah, you should go... And then...

00:31:30.132 --> 00:31:32.375
It's not really working anymore, huh?

00:31:32.395 --> 00:31:37.863
Yeah, and we're the kind of puppies where if we drink tea or coffee, it doesn't do anything to us.

00:31:38.043 --> 00:31:38.744
No.

00:31:38.764 --> 00:31:42.730
Yeah, so... It's good, you know.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.453
When we're slowing down like that, we take a nap.

00:31:45.894 --> 00:31:46.835
A nap.

00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:47.396
Yeah.

00:31:47.416 --> 00:31:50.921
Because you know, once you're kind of refreshed, you can go even faster.

00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:52.403
Yeah, and you're like, okay, I'm good to go.

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:52.884
Right?

00:31:52.904 --> 00:31:54.025
You can get better results.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:56.869
But sometimes a nap isn't so restful.

00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:58.652
Yeah, that's the downside.

00:31:58.672 --> 00:31:58.772
Yeah.

00:31:59.427 --> 00:32:03.695
But you know, I understand how you might just want to power through it.

00:32:04.716 --> 00:32:04.817
Yeah!

00:32:04.837 --> 00:32:06.339
We can take that to your place.

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:06.660
Right?

00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.826
It doesn't work well though.

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.208
That's the danger.

00:32:11.228 --> 00:32:12.551
You have to make sure you get up.

00:32:13.753 --> 00:32:18.381
Yeah, that's where having a sister is helpful, right Moco-chan?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.669
You know, if not a nap, just a good walk too.

00:32:24.689 --> 00:32:28.177
Yes, but you have to get the power through that, huh?

00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:28.598
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:34.311
But you know you never know what you're gonna see on a walk, so... If you go to sleep, you're just gonna see the pillows.

00:32:35.894 --> 00:32:39.363
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:39.383 --> 00:32:42.290
We hope that you know you're able to stay positive.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.398
Sleep is very important to stay positive.

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:46.581
And routine.

00:32:47.162 --> 00:32:47.804
Routine, yeah.

00:32:47.824 --> 00:32:50.330
Together we're routine, okay Ruffians?

00:32:52.315 --> 00:32:52.536
BAU BAU!

00:32:52.516 --> 00:32:54.199
Thank you!

00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:58.165
Thank you so much for all your submissions!

00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:02.713
We're always waiting for more Doggie of the Day Perro Sightings!

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:11.487
Questions and rewards too, so... Are you getting therapy right now, Moco-chan?

00:33:13.036 --> 00:33:16.943
So please send it to us with the hashtag.

00:33:17.464 --> 00:33:20.489
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:21.231
Thank you Ruffians!

00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:23.174
BAU BAU!

00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:27.602
We have another stream coming up very shortly here.

00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:30.630
We have De-den!

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.131
And record!

00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:32.993
And record day 7!

00:33:33.013 --> 00:33:36.759
There's not too many days left now.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:40.083
What will happen in the Kingdom of the Bustle?

00:33:40.384 --> 00:33:43.709
You know, I heard there's gonna be a party happening.

00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:45.411
How will the party go?

00:33:45.431 --> 00:33:46.873
I didn't hear about a party.

00:33:48.457 --> 00:33:54.719
Well, maybe Mococo, maybe Mococo will become the richest in all of Ubisoft.

00:33:54.759 --> 00:33:55.481
We'll have to see.

00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:57.829
You never know what happens in Ubisoft.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.652
You never know.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.613
BAU BAU!

00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:01.934
BAU BAU!

00:34:02.134 --> 00:34:03.696
And look at our schedule here.

00:34:04.297 --> 00:34:06.921
Wow, Saturday is the big finale.

00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:08.944
Day 8 of Enrico.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:12.509
And once we've done that, you know, it's kinda lonely.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.694
Gotta say goodbye to the best of everybody there.

00:34:15.974 --> 00:34:16.896
But not quite!

00:34:16.916 --> 00:34:19.860
Because it's Nala's birthday!

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.604
And we're gonna be playing Among Us together with her.

00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:26.390
And some other whole EN members too.

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:27.171
We will see.

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:30.527
It's been such a long time since we played Among Us!

00:34:30.828 --> 00:34:31.491
You remember it!

00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:33.762
When we last played Among Us!
