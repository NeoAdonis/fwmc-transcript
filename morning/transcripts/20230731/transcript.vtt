04:58.275 --> 05:00.901
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:00.921 --> 05:05.309
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:05.769 --> 05:09.382
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:09.449 --> 05:11.869
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:13.251 --> 05:15.707
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:15.860 --> 05:18.294
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:18.320 --> 05:22.296
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:22.396 --> 05:26.879
And today, we're your hosts
of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:27.259 --> 05:28.560
Thank you for joining us!

05:32.017 --> 05:33.500
Have you enjoyed
the past two days...

05:34.000 --> 05:36.040
of Advent debuts?

05:37.721 --> 05:41.733
It's been a busy two days for
hololive English -Advent-members

05:41.987 --> 05:47.554
like us, and Biboo, and
Shiori, and Nerissa, but...

05:47.927 --> 05:49.928
Did you enjoy them?
Did you watch them?

05:50.869 --> 05:55.428
Did you enjoy the two
days of Advent debuts?

05:56.380 --> 05:57.821
- How was it?
- How was it?

05:58.121 --> 05:59.128
How's it been?

05:59.342 --> 06:00.943
We hope you enjoyed them!

06:01.644 --> 06:03.885
Did you find a new oshi, maybe?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.967
It's always good
to get new favorites.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.284
Well...

06:13.287 --> 06:15.637
Today is a very
special day because

06:16.070 --> 06:20.376
this is the pilot episode
of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:21.797 --> 06:23.138
Does it seem kind of mysterious?

06:23.318 --> 06:24.939
Is it mysterious?

06:25.359 --> 06:32.087
Well, maybe a happy mysterious, but... Yes.
FUWAMOCO Morning is not that mysterious.

06:32.907 --> 06:38.307
It's our special live program held
every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:38.447 --> 06:39.668
FUWAMOCO.

06:39.988 --> 06:43.150
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:43.290 --> 06:44.751
Surprise!

06:44.871 --> 06:47.252
It's a short format
morning show.

06:47.332 --> 06:49.814
I guess it might be
a late night show.

06:50.274 --> 06:52.255
Which one is it for
you? What time is it?

06:52.544 --> 06:54.897
Is it a morning show?
Is it a late night show?

06:54.976 --> 06:56.714
- Or is it a...
- Should we change the name?

06:57.536 --> 06:58.536
Yeah, which one?

07:00.077 --> 07:01.077
Morning?

07:01.456 --> 07:03.256
- Morning?
- Afternoon?

07:04.200 --> 07:05.283
Late night, late night.

07:05.303 --> 07:06.844
FUWAMOCO Morning in your heart.

07:07.381 --> 07:12.927
But if it's like "FUWAMOCO Night
Time", that's a different kind of show, no?

07:14.773 --> 07:15.874
FUWAMOCO in your heart.

07:16.472 --> 07:19.316
Morning in your heart, but
also FUWAMOCO in your heart.

07:22.714 --> 07:26.409
FUWAMOCO Morning,
what we aim to do is we aim to

07:26.449 --> 07:31.043
bring a smile to your face and help
you start your day off on the right paw.

07:32.444 --> 07:35.134
You might have noticed
with our schedule, but y'know

07:35.158 --> 07:37.847
We're really hoping to start
our day together with you.

07:39.028 --> 07:40.029
And together.

07:40.089 --> 07:43.290
You know, playing fun games
and doing other different things.

07:43.390 --> 07:48.687
And that way we can all have a really
happy, healthy life routine all together.

07:48.712 --> 07:49.993
Yeah, it's important.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.915
We need you Ruffians
in good shape, okay?

07:52.975 --> 07:55.036
You gotta stay tip-top healthy.

07:55.096 --> 07:58.317
You have to be the
hot dog of every day.

07:59.531 --> 08:00.531
Right?

08:00.564 --> 08:01.564
Is that okay?

08:02.906 --> 08:04.503
You're good with
being healthy, right?

08:06.704 --> 08:09.365
Well, maybe it might happen
whether you like it or not.

08:10.023 --> 08:15.547
Anyways, we'd be really honored if
you could spend time with us like this.

08:15.572 --> 08:17.227
- And Japanese too!
- Yeah, you're right!

08:17.247 --> 08:18.247
Before we forget!

08:18.328 --> 08:19.528
FUWAMOCO Morning is...

08:23.396 --> 08:29.773
FUWAMOCO Morning is a
regular morning variety show.

08:29.807 --> 08:30.807
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.446
I know it's a bit late for
everyone in Japan, but

08:37.471 --> 08:44.783
This show's goal is to
help you start your day off

08:44.940 --> 08:45.940
With a smile.

09:11.245 --> 09:12.825
- That's the goal!
- Healthy!

09:13.644 --> 09:16.200
But yeah, today's
just the pilot episode.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.204
But we really hope that
FUWAMOCO Morning can be

09:19.451 --> 09:22.976
A really warm, cozy show
that we can all enjoy together.

09:23.016 --> 09:27.308
Maybe as you roll out of bed,
or maybe on your way to work?

09:27.341 --> 09:30.673
Or you're like "ahh,
today's no good, <i>dame da</i>."

09:30.854 --> 09:35.536
Then maybe we can put on FUWAMOCO Morning
and be like "okay, I'll get out of bed."

09:35.656 --> 09:37.957
That would make us really happy.

09:39.738 --> 09:41.940
But yeah, since
today's the pilot episode,

09:42.827 --> 09:43.827
It's a bit different.

09:43.864 --> 09:45.740
It's a bit different.
It's episode 0, right?

09:45.765 --> 09:46.765
Episode 0.

09:47.026 --> 09:51.967
Pilot episodes never really end
up to be, like, the actual show, right?

09:52.928 --> 09:55.149
- Well, we'll all have to find out!
- Yeah, right?

09:55.249 --> 09:56.669
It's gonna be a journey.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.010
- What does FUWAMOCO Morning become?
- Right?

09:59.110 --> 10:01.011
- It's still a mystery to us, too.
- Yeah.

10:01.411 --> 10:02.692
I think it's good like that.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:04.232 --> 10:07.874
But, first and foremost,
we have one thing.

10:09.574 --> 10:11.375
We wanted to say...

10:12.199 --> 10:14.460
Big, big thank you!

10:14.480 --> 10:16.000
De-den!

10:18.761 --> 10:22.603
We've reached 300,000 Ruffians!

10:22.803 --> 10:24.784
Can you believe it?

10:27.445 --> 10:33.618
We've reached 300,000 Ruffians! It's all
thanks to everyone! Thank you very much!

10:33.655 --> 10:35.346
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

10:37.558 --> 10:39.650
I don't really,
like, understand.

10:39.670 --> 10:45.492
We're absolutely blown away.

10:45.592 --> 10:49.934
It's actually kind
of dizzying for me.

10:59.071 --> 11:00.453
Thank you very much!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.669
Thank you so much
for all your support!

11:03.086 --> 11:06.105
And of course we're really
thankful to our senpai's hard work

11:06.141 --> 11:10.287
Building up hololive to make it
the amazing place that it is today.

11:11.346 --> 11:14.309
Even though today
is... Does it still count?

11:14.430 --> 11:17.794
It's our first day as brand new
members of hololive English.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.600
We would really like to
do the same, you know.

11:20.794 --> 11:23.571
To make hololive an even
more amazing and even

11:23.595 --> 11:26.372
more warm place for
our future kouhai, too.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.020
Isn't it a bit early
to be thinking that?

11:29.272 --> 11:34.802
It's a little bit early, but... It's
important, you know? It's important, so...

11:36.577 --> 11:41.427
It'd make us really happy if you continue to
let everyone know about all of us at Advent.

11:41.463 --> 11:44.870
And if you could continue to spread
your love of hololive everywhere you go.

11:46.737 --> 11:50.440
Maybe even FUWAMOCO
could be included in that too, huh?

11:51.929 --> 11:52.929
Is that okay?

11:53.528 --> 11:55.431
- Thank you for all the congrats!
- You know?

11:55.461 --> 12:01.508
I saw on Twitter some Ruffians
already have an oshi mark.

12:01.568 --> 12:04.770
Yeah, I saw it
too! I saw it too!

12:04.890 --> 12:06.792
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you!

12:06.812 --> 12:08.693
We're very happy
puppies right now.

12:09.475 --> 12:14.197
Once Twitter starts to be nice to us
again, we'll be able to look at more stuff.

12:14.718 --> 12:18.241
So it's been a bit difficult for us,
but we want to see lots of stuff.

12:20.196 --> 12:26.766
I noticed I made a spelling, a silly
typo, in actually a couple tweets.

12:27.163 --> 12:31.375
And I wanted to retweet it,
but then I got embarrassed.

12:31.763 --> 12:35.170
I haven't really been
able to look at the tweet.

12:35.530 --> 12:36.530
Did you notice it?

12:36.630 --> 12:37.851
You didn't notice, right?

12:38.224 --> 12:39.224
Please don't notice.

12:39.382 --> 12:40.981
Please don't notice, okay?

12:41.381 --> 12:46.391
You know, I even asked Fuwawa to
copy what she was gonna post, but

12:46.744 --> 12:48.514
Moco-chan looked at it
and she said it was okay.

12:48.539 --> 12:50.357
I was sleepy.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.126
You didn't notice, okay.

12:54.404 --> 12:55.404
I'll do better.

12:55.429 --> 12:58.589
But you know, deleting
tweets? That's no good.

12:58.609 --> 13:01.551
You can't delete it.

13:01.651 --> 13:02.652
Even if you have a typo.

13:10.061 --> 13:13.346
What? We're gonna make another big
mistake and then delete our tweets today.

13:14.322 --> 13:15.322
Just because we said it.

13:17.203 --> 13:19.764
Please. Twitter, be nice to us.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.325
My fingers... Which typo?

13:21.365 --> 13:22.606
No, don't look, okay?

13:22.646 --> 13:24.352
Don't look, don't
look, don't look.

13:24.377 --> 13:28.061
Now they're gonna be watching
our tweets and be like "Ooh..."

13:28.432 --> 13:29.432
We just...

13:29.457 --> 13:31.888
- No more typos, okay, Moco-chan?
- We did it to ourselves.

13:33.581 --> 13:38.096
Well, the next thing... You might have
noticed we had a bit of a surprise for you.

13:38.976 --> 13:41.159
De-den!

13:41.511 --> 13:43.130
Kaibutsu!

13:43.155 --> 13:44.543
Did you hear it?

13:44.568 --> 13:45.691
Did you watch it?

13:45.716 --> 13:47.105
Our first cover song.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.568
You didn't miss it, right?

13:49.831 --> 13:51.615
It was released at the very end.

13:51.675 --> 13:53.239
We kind of forgot!

13:55.316 --> 13:57.316
Yeah. Kaibutsu by YOASOBI-san.

13:57.538 --> 14:00.120
Yeah, we covered
Kaibutsu by YOASOBI-san.

14:00.262 --> 14:01.262
Moco-chan just said that.

14:02.155 --> 14:05.944
- But, it's... It's...
- Really happy.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.879
What did you think
of it? "It's really good"?

14:08.457 --> 14:10.516
- You like it?
- Thank you for listening to it!

14:14.682 --> 14:16.718
"Cover is fire!" Thank you!

14:20.354 --> 14:25.857
It made us really happy because, you know,
it's our first cover song with FUWAMOCO.

14:26.222 --> 14:31.281
And, you know, we actually, we don't
really have that much experience recording.

14:31.768 --> 14:34.059
- We just like to howl.
- We just howl.

14:34.289 --> 14:35.568
And that's it.

14:35.676 --> 14:38.867
Yeah. You don't record the
howling, you just howl, right?

14:38.904 --> 14:40.538
You just howl and
then you're done.

14:41.126 --> 14:45.272
So, it's really special to
us to have a recording that

14:45.309 --> 14:48.389
not only we can listen,
but you can listen to too.

14:48.414 --> 14:50.190
And, you know, Kaibutsu.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.112
We chose it for a
very special reason.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.033
Moco-chan, do you
want to talk about it more?

14:55.088 --> 15:00.121
Well, I feel like recently I've
had lots of just like, lightning.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.757
- <i>Hirameki</i>?
- <i>Hirameki</i>, like, it just strikes me.

15:04.858 --> 15:06.060
That's what Kaibutsu was.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.155
It was like "<i>yoshi yaro</i>"!

15:07.730 --> 15:09.367
I'm gonna do it! Kaibutsu!

15:10.949 --> 15:13.771
At first I was
like "Aah, uhm..."

15:14.412 --> 15:16.313
But then after
reading the lyrics,

15:17.368 --> 15:20.799
It really really resonated
within us, you know?

15:21.319 --> 15:25.101
The meaning of the lyrics for
songs is always really important to us

15:25.121 --> 15:27.466
So we'd like you to
check them out if you can.

15:27.895 --> 15:33.310
The reason why we covered
Kaibutsu this time was

15:33.340 --> 15:39.061
Because the lyrics really
resonated with our hearts. Right?

15:39.987 --> 15:42.546
That's the reason we did it.

15:43.787 --> 15:45.525
We sang that.

15:47.396 --> 15:49.577
- It was a new challenge.
- Yeah, it was.

15:49.602 --> 15:53.362
- It was a new challenge recording Kaibutsu.
- Yeah, there's so many harmonies.

15:53.387 --> 15:58.318
Right? Usually when we howl
together it's just like "BAU BAU!"

15:58.343 --> 16:00.874
And maybe like a
little bit "BAU BAU!"

16:00.899 --> 16:02.380
Moco-chan, you'd do the BAU BAU.

16:02.610 --> 16:03.610
Right?

16:04.495 --> 16:05.671
- That's accurate.
- Right?

16:06.043 --> 16:08.197
We're a bit nervous, but...

16:09.050 --> 16:15.589
Hamahiro-san did such a
good job with the mix magic.

16:15.877 --> 16:18.903
And Hae-san
with the illustration.

16:18.928 --> 16:21.598
Omika-san, beautiful video!

16:22.326 --> 16:23.374
You checked it out, right?

16:23.677 --> 16:27.300
Did you notice all the little
things? All the cool things?

16:27.813 --> 16:28.813
Go find them.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.380
If you watched it once, maybe it's time to
go watch it twice after FUWAMOCO Morning.

16:34.644 --> 16:35.644
Right?

16:36.105 --> 16:39.370
But it was a really,
really fun experience.

16:39.462 --> 16:41.431
We're looking forward
to hopefully doing more.

16:43.696 --> 16:46.293
We know we talked about the
lyrics being really important to us.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.871
But maybe if you don't
understand Japanese,

16:48.896 --> 16:51.795
it might be difficult to
understand the meaning,

16:52.158 --> 16:57.585
And that's why we did an English
translation ourselves: FUWAMOCO!

16:57.645 --> 16:59.386
FUWAMOCO did
the English translation.

16:59.406 --> 17:01.768
- It's not quite ready yet, though.
- Not quite yet.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.473
So we're hoping that it'll be up
soon, but we'll let you know, okay?

17:04.570 --> 17:06.111
Please look forward to it!

17:06.136 --> 17:08.853
But still watch it now, and then you
can watch it once they're done, okay?

17:08.878 --> 17:10.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:10.854 --> 17:12.195
You can turn off all the lights,

17:12.608 --> 17:15.316
Make it fullscreen and watch
it like you're in a movie theater.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.511
Really loud, right?

17:17.476 --> 17:18.667
Make the neighbors angry.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.057
That's the recommendation.

17:21.177 --> 17:22.857
Please watch it, okay?

17:24.829 --> 17:29.650
As for one thing... I thought
maybe we should address...

17:31.048 --> 17:33.619
- It's still our first day, but...
- This.

17:35.059 --> 17:38.215
There's a misunderstanding!
Did you know?

17:38.448 --> 17:39.757
- bau bau bau...
- This.

17:43.507 --> 17:44.507
Apparently...

17:46.746 --> 17:49.547
There's a rumor. A
misunderstanding.

17:50.690 --> 17:51.846
I was framed!

17:52.405 --> 17:53.814
I was framed.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.394
During the collab.

18:05.391 --> 18:11.045
Both Calli-senpai and A-chan thought
that Fuwawa said something that was wrong.

18:11.070 --> 18:13.898
No! I didn't say anything bad!

18:14.211 --> 18:18.319
I'm not the first Advent
member to say a bad word!

18:18.519 --> 18:20.541
No, no, no, no.

18:23.270 --> 18:27.479
Ruffians, you're not thinking
that I really said that, right?

18:27.859 --> 18:30.121
You know I'm not that
kind of person, right?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
We aren't.

18:31.674 --> 18:34.385
Us and Biboo are
not that type of person.

18:34.976 --> 18:38.808
I don't know about Nerissa and
Shiori, but... Not us and Biboo.

18:40.992 --> 18:44.936
You know, it happened when I
was explaining, you know, how...

18:45.476 --> 18:47.838
We got into The
Cell and everything.

18:48.498 --> 18:51.140
And I said "we got locked up!"

18:52.301 --> 18:55.083
But they thought
it was "fluffed up."

18:55.699 --> 18:59.546
Moco-chan, you're gonna
say it straight like that?

19:00.346 --> 19:01.687
But a bit different than that.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.288
A bit different than that!

19:04.271 --> 19:12.271
I think A-chan and Calli-senpai, maybe
they need to get their ears adjusted.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.351
Their minds out of the gutter.

19:15.756 --> 19:16.817
Ruffians, you too!

19:17.177 --> 19:18.398
You too if you thought that.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.020
You have to believe us, okay?

19:21.382 --> 19:22.942
"I believe them." Thank you!

19:24.142 --> 19:26.864
Thank you for believing.

19:26.884 --> 19:27.884
You understand that?

19:28.049 --> 19:32.163
I am not the first member
of Advent to say anything.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.907
And I will never be the last...

19:37.132 --> 19:38.132
The last member to say...

19:38.336 --> 19:41.138
I will never be a member that
says something bad like that.

19:42.127 --> 19:44.251
- Got it? Understood?
- Nerissa and Shiori? I'm not too sure.

19:48.588 --> 19:53.190
Now that we all
understand that... De-den!

19:54.000 --> 19:56.190
We wanted to talk
about the debut goods!

19:56.770 --> 19:57.817
The debut goods!

19:57.842 --> 19:58.931
Have you checked them out?

19:59.173 --> 20:01.285
OK, OK. I know maybe we're like:

20:01.322 --> 20:05.615
"Of course FUWAMOCO would want
to talk about the debut goods," right?

20:06.533 --> 20:08.842
Somebody probably told them.

20:09.612 --> 20:10.773
- Not that.
- No.

20:11.794 --> 20:12.815
We're really excited.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.816
Do you understand
how amazing this is?

20:15.981 --> 20:16.981
Do you understand?

20:18.487 --> 20:22.358
- You already bought them! Ooh! Thank you!
- Thank you!

20:24.385 --> 20:28.155
Well, the reason why we
wanted to talk about them is...

20:28.448 --> 20:32.155
You know, for FUWAMOCO,
this is really big.

20:32.195 --> 20:33.316
This is really exciting!

20:33.336 --> 20:35.846
I think for a lot of people,
they sort of think that like,

20:35.870 --> 20:38.380
Goods are given and it's
just gonna happen, right?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.462
- But it's not!
- No, it's not!

20:40.894 --> 20:42.855
So, we're really,
really excited.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
We hope you are too.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.578
We hope you check
them out, you know.

20:45.858 --> 20:49.823
There's the acrylic
stands, the acrylic panels.

20:49.883 --> 20:51.725
There's acrylic laminates.

20:52.045 --> 20:53.467
I am really excited about those.

20:53.567 --> 20:54.608
There's the stained glass.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.732
The strap! The
stained glass strap!

20:57.972 --> 20:59.714
And of course the voices.

20:59.934 --> 21:02.457
The voice too. Yes,
the pre-escape voices.

21:02.877 --> 21:05.478
Really, really fun to
be able to record it.

21:05.678 --> 21:07.678
- Ah, we forgot Japanese.
- We did forget!

21:08.882 --> 21:13.040
Everyone in Japan: did you guys
check out our Advent merch?

21:13.082 --> 21:16.501
- Our debut merch is on sale, y'know?
- It's on sale!

21:19.470 --> 21:20.850
I can't stop getting excited.

21:21.137 --> 21:22.699
Y'know, FUWAMOCO...

21:22.980 --> 21:26.948
The reason we wanted to
talk about our merch today

21:26.972 --> 21:30.940
is because we think
it's really important to us.

21:30.953 --> 21:31.173
Wow!

21:31.461 --> 21:33.028
- "Wow," isn't it?
- "Wow" indeed!

21:34.539 --> 21:37.879
And because merch is
not a given, of course,

21:38.294 --> 21:41.839
We're really happy.

21:43.416 --> 21:46.283
We'd be glad if you
could check it out.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.093
Please check it out, OK?

21:51.373 --> 21:54.255
Yeah, we didn't know.

21:55.255 --> 21:58.631
We haven't decided how many goods,
how many merch sets

21:58.656 --> 22:00.578
- we're supposed to buy.
- 'Cause you're supposed to buy 3.

22:00.603 --> 22:03.739
Three?! That's the
otaku rule, right?

22:03.840 --> 22:05.440
I can't remember, I
just remember three.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.221
One to, like, love?

22:08.861 --> 22:09.917
One for saving.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.670
And what was the other one?

22:14.146 --> 22:16.528
To love again when the
other one gets loved up?

22:16.955 --> 22:18.086
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

22:20.572 --> 22:22.473
But it's okay, you can
buy more than three too.

22:23.873 --> 22:24.873
An army.

22:24.898 --> 22:27.761
- An army of FUWAMOCO!
- Y'know? That is fun though.

22:28.511 --> 22:30.111
I do have a little army too.

22:31.312 --> 22:36.276
It's good to have collections
that make you happy, you know?

22:36.416 --> 22:39.018
Being surrounded by
the ones you love most.

22:42.825 --> 22:45.125
I hope you check it out,
especially the pre-escape voice.

22:45.804 --> 22:49.885
That was really... I wasn't
sure if I was doing things right.

22:49.905 --> 22:52.400
- It was fun, but it was a bit scary.
- Yeah.

22:53.626 --> 22:57.587
We're not gonna spoil anything,
so you'll have to give it a listen.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.528
But let us know what
you thought of it, okay?

23:01.034 --> 23:04.829
I'm sure your heart will be beating
just as fast as ours were, so...

23:04.864 --> 23:05.864
Ah, you got it?

23:05.889 --> 23:07.968
- Ah, thank you!
- Please listen, please listen!

23:09.595 --> 23:13.331
Oh, you bought
it, too? Thank you!

23:14.789 --> 23:19.708
Well, we also, it wasn't just the
pre-escape voice that we recorded,

23:19.732 --> 23:25.254
But we also did
the starting voice!

23:25.694 --> 23:27.063
You might have seen them because

23:27.088 --> 23:31.617
All the other hololive members
have been releasing them, but

23:31.694 --> 23:34.022
It's kind of nice because
with the start of Advent

23:34.047 --> 23:36.774
It's also the start of
our starting voices.

23:37.910 --> 23:42.934
We all, all of the other members
recorded in both English and Japanese.

23:43.014 --> 23:45.015
Both of them.

23:45.556 --> 23:50.260
And I know, for us, like...

23:50.620 --> 23:51.820
Not June. July.

23:52.121 --> 23:55.288
It's June. It's June, June,
June, July! July, July!

23:55.313 --> 23:56.313
It's July.

23:57.965 --> 24:03.409
But you know, for Shiori, and for
Bijou, and for Nerissa, it wasn't...

24:05.451 --> 24:06.630
It wasn't a walk in the park.

24:06.650 --> 24:09.911
No, it wasn't a walk in the park
for them to record it in Japanese.

24:09.951 --> 24:12.672
So, you know, we all
helped out each other.

24:13.092 --> 24:16.153
And we had a
little bit of a listen.

24:17.033 --> 24:19.454
And it's really, really cute.

24:20.374 --> 24:22.674
We recommend it a lot.

24:23.575 --> 24:25.515
Please check them
out as well, okay?

24:26.095 --> 24:28.116
There's a lot of
different variations.

24:28.156 --> 24:30.916
Cute morning voices,
sleepy voices, grumpy voices.

24:31.156 --> 24:32.857
Especially Moco-chan's
grumpy voice.

24:34.349 --> 24:38.552
But you never know what
it's going to quite be like, so...

24:39.500 --> 24:41.552
"I can't wait to listen."

24:41.652 --> 24:42.652
???

24:42.672 --> 24:46.974
Please listen to
our starting voices.

24:46.999 --> 24:49.254
They're both in
English and Japanese.

24:49.314 --> 24:54.715
All the Advent members did
it, so please check them out.

24:58.775 --> 25:02.056
This is very important information
for FUWAMOCO Morning.

25:03.364 --> 25:04.627
We wanted to let you know that

25:05.210 --> 25:08.767
Starting next time there will be a
new corner for FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:08.796 --> 25:12.878
We'd like to introduce two new
segments called Doggie of the Day.

25:13.184 --> 25:14.434
We'll start with the first one.

25:15.303 --> 25:19.815
The next FUWAMOCO Morning
will have two new segments.

25:20.848 --> 25:24.159
The first one is called
Doggie of the Day.

25:26.144 --> 25:29.347
There's a corner called Doggie of
the Day, and we're hoping that

25:29.372 --> 25:34.047
You'll send us your best puppers for us to
introduce and brighten everyone's day.

25:34.607 --> 25:37.088
We've already seen
some very bestest friends.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
They're so cute.

25:38.309 --> 25:43.591
They've been being sent in to help
FUWAMOCO, and it's been very, very helpful.

25:43.631 --> 25:45.464
We're very happy to see it, but

25:45.489 --> 25:48.908
We'd also like to nominate them with the
FUWAMOCO Morning...

25:48.933 --> 25:52.860
- The #FWMCMORNING hashtag.
- It's in the title.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.147
So, you know, we
can introduce them.

25:55.432 --> 25:56.770
On that topic.

25:57.618 --> 26:01.201
You tweeted.
Hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

26:02.543 --> 26:04.705
Maybe they have you.
Ruffians!

26:05.846 --> 26:06.846
Have you?

26:07.397 --> 26:10.233
It's okay if you don't know
what to tweet, you know.

26:10.516 --> 26:12.711
There's always BAU BAU.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.508
So...

26:16.462 --> 26:17.642
Go and tweet.
BAU BAU!

26:17.862 --> 26:19.363
#FWMCMORNING.

26:19.460 --> 26:22.577
- Or a good pupper.
- Oh, good pupper. Yeah, you know.

26:23.544 --> 26:28.705
But yes, we'll be waiting to see
your furry and fuzzy dog friends.

26:28.893 --> 26:29.893
And fluffy.

26:30.325 --> 26:31.679
- Furry and fluffy.
- Yeah.

26:31.704 --> 26:33.631
Ah, I forgot "fluffy", didn't I?

26:36.447 --> 26:40.327
But not just that, we also have the
Today I Went for a Walk segment.

26:43.233 --> 26:45.539
It's not just the Doggie
of the Day segment.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.308
- It's like "Today's Walk".
- Today I Went for a Walk.

26:49.376 --> 26:51.091
- We're doing it right.
- Yes, we are.

26:52.141 --> 26:55.121
Yeah, there's a
segment like that.

26:55.501 --> 26:57.342
Yes, so for Today
I Went for a Walk.

26:57.823 --> 27:00.905
We'd like to ask you to
maybe submit a picture.

27:00.930 --> 27:02.326
- If you want.
- Yeah, if you want.

27:02.351 --> 27:08.271
And a small report when you go out for a
walk using the #FWMCMORNING.

27:08.512 --> 27:09.532
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

27:11.977 --> 27:14.268
You know how much we
like to go for walks, right?

27:14.293 --> 27:15.293
Walks are so good.

27:15.598 --> 27:18.827
So we thought that it would make
us really happy if we could hear

27:18.851 --> 27:22.130
about all the wonderful little
adventures that you'd be going on.

27:22.230 --> 27:24.538
Usually we like to take
little photos and stuff like that

27:24.562 --> 27:27.142
to remember like "oh, this
happened today" and stuff.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.559
- Right?
- So we thought that

27:28.584 --> 27:30.403
It'd make you happy
too if you did that.

27:30.428 --> 27:31.428
You know, like...

27:32.326 --> 27:34.209
- "Today's flowers are really pretty!"
- Right?

27:34.234 --> 27:36.805
Or you saw something
like "haha, that's silly!"

27:36.825 --> 27:38.106
Those kind of things.

27:39.056 --> 27:40.817
But only if you're comfortable.

27:40.937 --> 27:43.743
Yeah, you could,
like, share a photo.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.601
Yeah, flowers, nature.

27:45.741 --> 27:47.903
Those kind of things.
Anything that made you smile.

27:48.163 --> 27:50.745
If it made you smile, then
it'll definitely make us smile.

27:51.543 --> 27:55.660
So please make sure you add the
hashtag #FWMCMORNING to your tweet.

27:55.685 --> 27:58.307
And if you could include
a sentence or two just

27:58.331 --> 28:01.353
about how your walk was,
maybe how it made you feel.

28:01.373 --> 28:02.674
Even if it's like a rainy day.

28:02.772 --> 28:06.838
Yeah, you know, just what
made today's walk extra special.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.137
- Right?
- Yeah.

28:08.772 --> 28:12.065
We'll be looking forward
to your stories of

28:12.089 --> 28:15.478
Getting outside, stretching the
puppers, getting some fresh air.

28:15.538 --> 28:16.598
Those kind of things.

28:16.658 --> 28:19.459
Can you do that?

28:19.639 --> 28:21.199
We'll be waiting, okay?

28:21.919 --> 28:23.560
We'll be waiting, so
make sure you do it.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.046
- We also need more help.
- We need more help.

28:36.690 --> 28:39.355
We're a little bit
needy sometimes.

28:40.877 --> 28:42.179
Hopefully that's okay, but...

28:42.949 --> 28:45.702
Yes!
On tomorrow!

28:46.193 --> 28:47.282
On tomorrow!

28:47.482 --> 28:53.805
On tomorrow at 6pm PT, 9pm ET,
1am GMT, and 10am JST.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.825
From 10am Japan time.

28:57.093 --> 28:59.233
We have our first Q&amp;A stream!

29:03.775 --> 29:05.555
We're gonna be doing it!

29:05.580 --> 29:07.524
Tomorrow!
Yes, tomorrow!

29:08.306 --> 29:10.745
So we'd like you to
ask, we've seen a lot of

29:10.769 --> 29:13.607
questions, a lot of really
good questions so far.

29:13.687 --> 29:16.668
But I'm sure you probably
have still lots of questions.

29:16.748 --> 29:21.709
So if you have any, please send
them to us with the hashtag, helpFWMC.

29:22.169 --> 29:24.960
And we'll pick out as
many as we can, okay?

29:24.985 --> 29:26.225
It's right there on the screen.

29:26.990 --> 29:29.571
Yeah, tomorrow, tomorrow!

29:29.615 --> 29:30.893
Is it that shocking?

29:31.476 --> 29:33.881
Well, if you can think of a
question before tomorrow, right?

29:33.906 --> 29:36.714
There's a lot, a lot of
questions I think you could think of.

29:36.734 --> 29:41.456
You know, like, what's it like
being twin demon dog sisters?

29:42.697 --> 29:45.618
What's life like together?

29:45.658 --> 29:46.659
What's Pero like?

29:46.699 --> 29:48.379
You know, those
kind of things, right?

29:48.860 --> 29:52.601
So, we're gonna be looking
forward to your questions, okay?

29:52.621 --> 29:55.603
But is tomorrow a thing?

29:57.096 --> 29:58.096
I don't get it.

29:58.232 --> 29:59.232
Tomorrow!

30:01.005 --> 30:03.130
I'm happy, you're
happy about it.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.850
I see lots of good questions.

30:07.030 --> 30:10.683
There's a lot of good questions.

30:11.628 --> 30:18.194
I'd make us happy if you'd tweet
them with the hashtag #helpFWMC.

30:18.232 --> 30:21.860
- That's cute in Japanese. "<i>Help FUWAMOCO</i>"
- <i>Help FUWAMOCO</i>, yeah!

30:21.993 --> 30:23.251
Help me!

30:25.538 --> 30:27.539
We need a lot of help.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.281
But maybe it's a bit
more fun now, right?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.943
But that's not all!

30:34.604 --> 30:39.146
After FUWAMOCO Morning today,
later in the evening we have VLOG!

30:39.346 --> 30:40.847
Tonight!

30:40.907 --> 30:42.068
Even better than tomorrow.

30:42.531 --> 30:48.891
Yeah, tonight at 6PM PT, 9PM ET,
1AM GMT, and 10AM JST.

30:49.226 --> 30:52.064
- In Japan time, 5am...
- 10am.

30:53.826 --> 30:57.130
- You're right, 10am.
- Not 5am, 10am.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.155
Yes, yes, yes.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.573
We'll be playing our
first game, Phogs.

31:01.873 --> 31:04.974
We've become a
cutie hot dog phog.

31:06.854 --> 31:09.449
We've never played it
before, but it looks very

31:09.473 --> 31:11.955
cute and colorful, and
we make cute noises.

31:11.975 --> 31:13.650
Yeah, BAU BAU! BAU BAU!

31:14.955 --> 31:16.650
Yeah, it's tonight!

31:17.604 --> 31:18.669
Even closer.

31:19.758 --> 31:21.319
We're really
looking forward to it.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.883
I feel like it's been such a long time since
I played a game together with you, Moco-chan.

31:26.383 --> 31:28.204
It'll be very relaxing.
I think.

31:28.627 --> 31:29.627
- Really?
- I think.

31:29.652 --> 31:31.767
We're not gonna,
like, fight or argue?

31:32.148 --> 31:33.829
I wanna go this way!
I wanna go that way!

31:34.289 --> 31:37.271
If we wanna go one way
later, we can just do that later.

31:38.833 --> 31:39.833
It's not that hard.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.140
You'll have to come and check
it out to see how things go, okay?

31:44.041 --> 31:47.904
I think this is maybe the only cute
game on our schedule this week.

31:48.485 --> 31:51.047
Yeah. All of them are
sort of scary or tough.

31:51.107 --> 31:56.030
Yeah, but... It'll be okay because
you'll be there with us, right, Ruffians?

31:56.491 --> 31:58.632
Right!
You'll join us, right?

31:59.313 --> 32:00.594
Right?
Right!

32:03.756 --> 32:05.618
Well... Before...

32:07.483 --> 32:12.005
Before we get going, we'd like to share our
schedule and just have another little peek.

32:12.428 --> 32:13.428
One last time.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.744
It's a bit tiny, but if you'd
like to see it a bit bigger,

32:15.768 --> 32:18.367
You can check out
our Twitter as well.

32:19.067 --> 32:24.467
We have some very exciting things
coming up and we'd really like you to

32:24.491 --> 32:29.891
make sure that you come and walk out
at our FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

32:30.232 --> 32:31.412
On Saturday?

32:31.492 --> 32:32.733
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

32:34.240 --> 32:38.080
- On Sunday in Japan... Sunday, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

32:38.105 --> 32:42.189
We'll have our first ever karaoke stream.

32:42.380 --> 32:46.599
We'll have our karaoke Rock n' Rawr Party.

32:46.624 --> 32:49.377
It's kind of like "<i>rokku an
rouru</i>," right? Just like that.

32:50.404 --> 32:51.724
It's got an interesting name.

32:55.016 --> 32:58.242
We'd be glad if you could join us.

32:58.457 --> 33:00.837
- We like singing, after all.
- Let's sing together!

33:00.864 --> 33:03.964
Please come and please
sing along with us, OK?

33:04.444 --> 33:05.965
- We're really excited.
- Yeah.

33:06.024 --> 33:09.059
There's a lot of good
music, a lot of songs.

33:09.579 --> 33:12.229
- Good songs are good!
- Good songs are good, you know?

33:12.290 --> 33:13.672
Especially anime songs too.

33:14.597 --> 33:15.629
We hope you'll be there!

33:16.123 --> 33:19.385
We also have a
very, very mysterious

33:19.472 --> 33:22.184
Surprise stream on Sunday.

33:22.564 --> 33:24.624
So it's a question,
question, question.

33:24.763 --> 33:26.313
- What could it be?
- What could it be?

33:26.338 --> 33:27.865
- We don't know.
- Question, question, question.

33:27.890 --> 33:29.905
And also we have
Advent collab playing.

33:30.386 --> 33:32.446
- Left 4 Dead 2.
- Left 4 Dead 2.

33:32.626 --> 33:34.106
We need your
strength, so please.

33:34.427 --> 33:35.487
Please.

33:36.655 --> 33:37.655
Please, please.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.657
But I'm really looking
forward to it though.

33:40.682 --> 33:43.664
Because even though it's
kind of scary, you know,

33:43.688 --> 33:49.084
Shiori and Bijou and Nerissa
will be there, so it'll be okay, right?

33:49.545 --> 33:50.725
Right.

33:51.726 --> 33:57.255
Well, before we say
BAU BAU for now,

33:57.279 --> 34:03.629
We'd actually like to shout out to
some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

34:03.749 --> 34:04.749
Is that okay?

34:07.461 --> 34:08.461
Okay?

34:08.951 --> 34:11.231
- Say BAU BAU now!
- BAU BAU! OK?

34:12.043 --> 34:13.043
BAU BAU!

34:17.759 --> 34:20.243
Alex!
BAU BAU!

34:20.343 --> 34:21.823
It's so fast I can't read it!

34:22.223 --> 34:24.524
Nisha!
BAU BAU!

34:24.549 --> 34:26.789
Ryo-san!
BAU BAU!

34:26.944 --> 34:28.751
[???] BAU BAU!

34:28.801 --> 34:31.265
[???] BAU BAU!

34:31.546 --> 34:36.787
And to every other Ruffian out there,
we hope you have a howl of a day!

34:37.147 --> 34:40.108
This was today's
FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:40.328 --> 34:42.286
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

34:42.618 --> 34:45.203
BAU BAU!
