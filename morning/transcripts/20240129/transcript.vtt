00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:10.776
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:14.718
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:17.420
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.861
BAU BAU!

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:24.336
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:27.456
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:30.657
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:30.757 --> 00:05:32.377
BAU BAU!

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:37.738
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:39.919
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.459
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for the 74th episode!

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:44.919
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.466
74.

00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:53.766
Maybe it's time that we don't say that anymore, Moco-chan.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:57.591
Do we need to keep count?

00:05:57.611 --> 00:05:59.113
I think we should!

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.795
It's worth it.

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:04.038
Now it's just like, oh, it's another number going up.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.850
Do it!

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.951
Yay!

00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.411
Okay then.

00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:11.811
Wow.

00:06:12.552 --> 00:06:15.653
Ruffians just joining us for the first time today.

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:21.974
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:22.735
A.K.A.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:23.715
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.136

00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:34.338
So!

00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:37.820
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:39.621
Hashtag.

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:43.824
FWMCMORNING!

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:48.727
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:51.688
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.409
Ruffians, you guys!

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.092
How is it you type hashtag hashtag every time?

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:02.115
How is it you're so silly, huh?

00:07:05.517 --> 00:07:07.920
I feel like just yesterday it was Monday.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.343
And yet, now, it's Monday.

00:07:12.864 --> 00:07:16.587
How can yesterday be Monday and today be Monday at the same time?

00:07:17.548 --> 00:07:19.129
I don't know, that's the problem!

00:07:22.672 --> 00:07:24.574
Things are silly hot off the air.

00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:29.918
Well, there's been more silliness.

00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:37.305
Because there was another Pero Sighting.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.747
Let's see where these Ruffians are Pero this time!

00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:42.489
De-den!

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.711
How close was that?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.272
Just looking at a nice family of dogs.

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:51.053
Oh, Pero?

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:52.234
Pero's there!

00:07:52.434 --> 00:07:56.237
He seems to be watching them from a nice comfortable distance too.

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:57.218
That's cool.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.401
Yeah, did he decide to take up a new hobby, you think?

00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:02.883
Actually, this looks like a pretty nice one.

00:08:03.403 --> 00:08:07.126
Yeah, you know, just getting out into the wild.

00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:10.829
All on his own with the nature and everything.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.392
Just enjoying watching the birds and all the sounds.

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:16.694
Right!

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.936
This is just, this is nice and healthy.

00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:19.957
Nice and healthy.

00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:23.580
Yeah, it's great that Pero's trying out new hobbies, right?

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:23.760
Yeah.

00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:27.503
I know, you know how we feel about Braids, right, Ruffians?

00:08:27.543 --> 00:08:32.127
So, braid watching probably isn't our number one pick, right, Anyo?

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:32.848
No, hobby!

00:08:35.117 --> 00:08:38.599
You know, we have enough hobbies as it is and things we want to try.

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:39.720
Yeah, a lot more to add.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.923
But you know, we're happy that he's doing something out of the ordinary.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:44.783
Right, right.

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:46.464
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:48.406
Trying something new.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:48.846
Yeah.

00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:49.947
Dangerous?

00:08:50.087 --> 00:08:51.167
I don't think it's that dangerous.

00:08:51.187 --> 00:08:53.909
Sometimes breeds can be scary though, so I get it.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:55.330
Not ducks though.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.011
Ducks, they just quack.

00:08:57.251 --> 00:08:57.932
They just quack.

00:08:58.192 --> 00:08:58.712
Yeah.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:03.195
But Ruffians, has there been any hobbies that you've been wanting to try out?

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:03.675
Huh.

00:09:04.056 --> 00:09:04.376
Huh.

00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.622
Do you wanna try going watching the dogs too?

00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:13.664
Painting!

00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:15.205
Painting sounds good!

00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:16.185
Fishing!

00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:17.666
Fishing!

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:18.546
Can I go too?

00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:27.195
Maybe it can take a bit of inspiration from Pero.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:27.575
Oh!

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.697
I'm going to try them out sometime soon, okay?

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:30.217
Yeah, just like Pero.

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:30.357
Yeah!

00:09:30.377 --> 00:09:30.538
BAU BAU!

00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:30.718
BAU BAU!

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.559
That's a pretty nice start to the week, right?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.331
Yeah!

00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.014
BAU BAU!

00:09:35.114 --> 00:09:36.096
BAU BAU!

00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:39.041
That's a pretty nice start to the week, right?

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.828
Better not be very nasty, it's been my fault all the time!

00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:43.649
For once!

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.474
Yeah. Can you play with Pero?

00:09:46.574 --> 00:09:50.421
I don't know if that's a hobby Gunpla, that's a good hobby. Yeah.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.752
Well, you know, a nice start to the week.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:56.792
Right!

00:09:56.952 --> 00:10:01.175
Maybe some new hobbies, maybe trying something new is in order, right?

00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:04.717
Ruffians!

00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:07.319
You know... It's the start of a new week!

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:09.320
Yeah, the start of a new week.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.141
We already have something to say.

00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:12.002
Yeah.

00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:21.027
And you know, well... I kinda told you that our 6-month anniversary for my debut is just around the corner, right?

00:10:21.127 --> 00:10:21.608
Right!

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:30.227
Well, there's actually also been a bit of another milestone too!

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:36.052
Do you know what it is?

00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:37.093
No.

00:10:37.814 --> 00:10:37.914
No.

00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:41.295
I'll remind you then.

00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:42.817
I'm Doggy Pack!

00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:47.280
BAU BAU!

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.224
It's been five months since the Doggy Pack formed and our membership opened.

00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:52.504
BAU BAU!

00:10:52.524 --> 00:10:53.005
Isn't that strange?

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:08.399
It feels like it was just the other day that we opened it up.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:08.920
You know what?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.941
Now we're here.

00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:19.999
It's been five months!

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:20.980
Five months!

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.220
Oh my gosh.

00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.161
That's a lot of time.

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:24.082
Yeah.

00:11:24.222 --> 00:11:25.523
BAU BAU!

00:11:26.263 --> 00:11:29.185
There's been lots and lots of fun memories, you know.

00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:31.687
Playing Fall Guys all together.

00:11:31.707 --> 00:11:31.907
Right!

00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:37.471
A special Christmas Eve together.

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:41.414
You know, watching movies and just chatting too.

00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:43.475
Yeah, being angry about pancakes.

00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:45.985
So many things!

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.006
Yeah, right!

00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:54.620
We'd like to be able to share more things with you and make more memories from here on out too.

00:11:56.892 --> 00:12:00.733
You know, we need to get those treats to you too.

00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:01.853
Yeah.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.874
Doggy Pack memories, you know what we mean, right?

00:12:04.894 --> 00:12:06.014
Treats.

00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:06.354
BAU BAU.

00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:07.535
Yeah.

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:09.395
Thank you!

00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:11.356
Thank you!

00:12:11.436 --> 00:12:17.517
Thank you for being a part of our very special Doggy Pack for five months now!

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:17.617
Yeah.

00:12:18.117 --> 00:12:18.498
BAU BAU!

00:12:18.578 --> 00:12:21.258
We'll continue to depend on you, okay?

00:12:21.358 --> 00:12:23.519
And sometimes, you know, we'll...

00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:25.351
BAU BAU!

00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:25.611
Thank you!

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:36.007
Our Doggy Anniversary!

00:12:36.027 --> 00:12:37.708
Doggy Pack!

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:39.529
So fun!

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:41.530
Well, Ruffians!

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.192
Actually, we received a scoop!

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:47.753
A scoop from a Ruffian!

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:52.895
Thank you Miyako for your impeccable journalism!

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:54.956
BAU BAU!

00:12:56.929 --> 00:13:02.992
We know that we've been making a big deal all this week, you know, since it's our birthday week.

00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:07.034
But, it's not only our birthday week.

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:13.417
It's Poriru Onee-chan's birthday too!

00:13:13.577 --> 00:13:18.980
Because it's actually her birthday now!

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.382
Happy birthday, Poriru Onee-chan!

00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:22.862
BAU BAU!

00:13:27.483 --> 00:13:29.263
Can you believe it, Ruffians?

00:13:29.383 --> 00:13:32.224
Our birthdays are so close together, right?

00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:33.545
So close!

00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:41.467
Please give her a happy birthday and check out her 3D birthday live tomorrow too!

00:13:42.027 --> 00:13:44.007
It won't be that hard to wake up for.

00:13:44.227 --> 00:13:46.448
Just think of it as an early FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:49.169
It's an early FUWAMOCO Morning, you know?

00:13:51.109 --> 00:14:01.737
4am PT, but a bunch of our Iian and Ivy-senpai will be performing as guests along with Pororo and Itten at her rocking pretty ride.

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah, we're gonna do our best to wake up early for it too.

00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:09.102
So, just an early FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:14:09.122 --> 00:14:10.763
Just an early FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.484
A bit of a wake-up call.

00:14:12.864 --> 00:14:13.324
You know?

00:14:13.404 --> 00:14:17.866
So, let's make sure it's a very happy birthday week for everyone!

00:14:17.886 --> 00:14:19.067
Okay!

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:22.488
BAU BAU!

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:25.129
Look at Poruru-oneechan there!

00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:26.690
Right!

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.791
I'm so excited!

00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:30.232
BAU BAU!

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:32.372
Ruff!

00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:41.960
Ruffians, you know what we're up to this weekend, right?

00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:45.244
We spent the weekend together.

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:50.228
Playing a lot of... a certain game.

00:14:50.468 --> 00:14:53.431
This weekend, we made a discovery.

00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:54.873
A new discovery.

00:14:54.913 --> 00:14:55.894
Yeah, and I'd say...

00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:58.815
Pretty surprising too.

00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:05.837
You know, we played Metal Gear Solid 2 on both Saturday and Sunday this weekend, right?

00:15:07.438 --> 00:15:16.642
It's been a very interesting, a very FUWAMOCO playthrough so far, right?

00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:22.504
But, it was then we found out

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:34.297
Yeah, for some reason, Metal Gear Solid makes us say the same things at the same time SO MUCH.

00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:36.058
Yeah.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.960
You know, we think like crazy.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.041
Yeah.

00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:43.163
And on silly things.

00:15:43.423 --> 00:15:45.084
Really silly things.

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.886
You know, like dance party.

00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:51.290
And Tough Cookie!

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.910
And our longest sync yet!

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.310
Is at 129 pages.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.551
Did you know this, Ruffians?

00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.032
Nagasugi nagasugiru yo ne.

00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:00.252
Why?

00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:00.592
Why?

00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:00.732
Why?

00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:12.372
Of course!

00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:13.292
Yeah!

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:15.614
Moco-chan, don't break your neck!

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:16.814
Oh my gosh!

00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:19.176
Whoa, we need a pillow.

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:23.379
Moco-chan, are you okay?

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:25.140
BAU BAU!

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.302
BAU BAU!

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:37.347
I feel like, you know, it's so common that, I don't know, maybe something weird is going on.

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:37.968
Right.

00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:39.605
There isn't.

00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:41.226
There isn't.

00:16:41.886 --> 00:16:43.447
Yeah, so why Ruffians?

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:48.088
You know, because she was a dancing vampire.

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:48.548
Yeah.

00:16:49.089 --> 00:16:52.650
So then, naturally, you think dance pyre.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:53.750
Yeah.

00:16:55.111 --> 00:16:58.272
It's not like anything prompted us to think of dance pyre.

00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:00.953
It's just natural.

00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:03.294
It's just natural, huh?

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:04.194
Yeah.

00:17:05.453 --> 00:17:08.955
Ruffians!

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:16.701
We'd like to ask that you please make a record about the strange phenomena that's going on, okay?

00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:19.242
It needs to be documented, okay?

00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:29.869
You know, maybe this phenomena... Maybe it should be called... Multiple Girl Synchronization 2.

00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:36.536
Daughters in Unison!

00:17:37.617 --> 00:17:38.518
That sounds familiar.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.260
Right!

00:17:42.842 --> 00:17:43.262
Yeah.

00:17:44.303 --> 00:17:46.345
Kept you synchronizing, huh?

00:17:47.346 --> 00:17:49.048
BAU BAU!

00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:53.552
BAU BAU!

00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:56.395
I don't need to worry about being bonked, right?

00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:58.677
Unless I'm being too silly.

00:17:59.449 --> 00:17:59.889
BAU BAU!

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.711
BAU BAU!

00:18:02.912 --> 00:18:07.055
Well, maybe you do have something to apologize for, huh?

00:18:07.996 --> 00:18:09.237
No bonks though, right?

00:18:10.738 --> 00:18:11.239
Right?

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.761
Ah, well.

00:18:16.483 --> 00:18:18.324
Extra Ruffians, you know.

00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:22.928
I guess you know on the topic of Metal Gear Solid 2.

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:25.931
I have something to say.

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:32.918
Wow, I have to make a bit of an apology.

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:41.522
Yeah, I might have gotten a little bit worked up.

00:18:44.044 --> 00:18:46.025
Maybe a bit too excited.

00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:50.247
I kind of forgot where I was when we were playing yesterday.

00:18:51.187 --> 00:18:57.051
Yeah, you know, see, especially when we were battling that one boss, you know, big boy.

00:18:58.129 --> 00:19:01.314
I started getting a bit too intense.

00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:02.876
Did you notice?

00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:05.920
Did you?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.242
We know!

00:19:07.362 --> 00:19:09.305
Actually I didn't.

00:19:10.727 --> 00:19:12.209
Just a little bit!

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.450
Well...

00:19:14.165 --> 00:19:15.345
Uh, yeah.

00:19:15.986 --> 00:19:21.647
Uh, you know, I forgot that I was there helping backseat Moco-chan, you know?

00:19:22.007 --> 00:19:23.308
I got a little lost.

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:24.648
Yeah.

00:19:25.148 --> 00:19:30.310
It wasn't time for me to backseat like I do when I'm watching Arino and Game Center CX.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.350
Yeah.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:31.810
No.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.851
Not at all.

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:33.331
No.

00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:34.191
Yeah.

00:19:35.037 --> 00:19:35.938
It's Moco-chan!

00:19:36.298 --> 00:19:37.038
Not Arino.

00:19:37.258 --> 00:19:38.339
I'm not Arino!

00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:39.920
I'm Mococo!

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.762
So, you know, I apologize.

00:19:43.262 --> 00:19:45.984
Yeah, I did catch myself a few times.

00:19:46.424 --> 00:19:49.146
I was able to tone myself down a bit.

00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:51.607
But, I'm sorry, Ruffians.

00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:52.788
Yeah.

00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:54.489
I'm sorry.

00:19:55.449 --> 00:19:59.232
I'll make sure to be a little more collected and helpful next time, okay?

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:02.475
You understand, right, Moco-chan?

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:04.016
It was intense.

00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:06.338
I talk a lot, so it's okay.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.241
That's why I have to get a bit louder than normal.

00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:12.944
Right!

00:20:13.584 --> 00:20:16.287
Maybe it was just about good.

00:20:16.347 --> 00:20:17.708
Maybe I should continue that.

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:19.209
Maybe not.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.290
BAU BAU!

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.589
Ah, it was perfect, perfect, that back seating!

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:28.650
Nah.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.373
It was a bit much.

00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:36.056
Ruffians!

00:20:36.517 --> 00:20:37.478
Bye this time!

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:41.001
You kinda know what week it is, right?

00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:41.681
I should hope.

00:20:42.602 --> 00:20:45.084
What week do you think it is, Ruffians?

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:46.465
Huh?

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:47.867
Huh?

00:20:49.908 --> 00:20:50.429
Huh?

00:20:51.474 --> 00:20:52.215
Natto time?

00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:53.556
It's not natto week.

00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:55.377
It's not that week, Ruffians.

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:56.538
Birthday week!

00:20:56.718 --> 00:20:57.099
Yeah!

00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:57.659
Yeah.

00:20:57.739 --> 00:20:58.940
Well, Moco-chan, go ahead.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.185
Uh... Well... OBVIOUS!

00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:09.829
Uh... I thought... I made it obvious.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.473
But... It seems like some of you... Oh.

00:21:16.495 --> 00:21:19.417
Are still waiting to be officially invited.

00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:23.331
So, cheerio!

00:21:24.213 --> 00:21:24.915
No forgetting.

00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:27.260
No excuses!

00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:29.545
Not this time!

00:21:29.906 --> 00:21:30.367
Because!

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.053
You here are finally invited to our birthdays!

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:37.353
Yeah.

00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:39.435
Happening at the end of this week!

00:21:39.615 --> 00:21:41.616
On February 1st, Fuwawa's birthday.

00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:42.216
My birthday.

00:21:42.317 --> 00:21:44.718
And on February 2nd, my birthday.

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:45.519
Moco-chan's birthday.

00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:51.323
As well as our birthday countdown on the 31st, just before Midnight PT!

00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:51.943
Yeah!

00:21:52.503 --> 00:21:53.164
Got that?

00:21:53.264 --> 00:21:53.604
Yeah!

00:21:53.964 --> 00:21:54.365
Yeah!

00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:56.546
You wouldn't miss it, right?

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:57.087
Right?

00:21:57.427 --> 00:21:57.827
Yeah!

00:21:58.387 --> 00:21:58.728
Inoue.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.906
For our individual birthdays, we're gonna be singing for you and you only!

00:22:08.926 --> 00:22:10.868
And it'll just be one of us.

00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:12.450
All on our own.

00:22:13.011 --> 00:22:13.531
For once.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.751
It's super rare!

00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:17.812
It's never happened before, okay?

00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:20.954
You'll have to be there for it, okay?

00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:29.540
You know, it's our first birthdays with members of hololive, so we're really looking forward to seeing you there!

00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:35.404
We wanna see all your reactions to some exciting things.

00:22:35.825 --> 00:22:36.305
Okay!

00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:38.747
Exciting stuff!

00:22:39.207 --> 00:22:39.527
Yeah.

00:22:39.987 --> 00:22:41.689
You might be interested in!

00:22:41.709 --> 00:22:41.749
Oh!

00:22:44.995 --> 00:22:48.298
This may be!

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.019
We'll be waiting, okay?

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.582
BAU BAU!

00:22:53.542 --> 00:23:00.568
Although... I'm sort of nervous.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:08.735
About... You know... It's all on my own, so... It's on your own?

00:23:08.975 --> 00:23:11.858
Super chat reading and everything is on my own too.

00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:17.857
Gonna have to do your best, Moco-chan.

00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:19.098
Be brave, okay?

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:20.438
It'll be okay.

00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:23.100
It'll be okay, Ruffians.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.841
I got this.

00:23:28.683 --> 00:23:30.264
BAU BAU!

00:23:30.644 --> 00:23:32.065
BAU BAU!

00:23:33.706 --> 00:23:35.647
Wow, Ruffians!

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.572
It's birthday week, but it's still that time of the week!

00:23:42.352 --> 00:23:43.752
Moco-chan!

00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:51.995
It's time for you to challenge yourself again at NATO!

00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:57.957
You know it's the beginning of a new week, right, Ruffians?

00:23:58.557 --> 00:24:02.619
Because it's the beginning, it's okay if you maybe fail, right?

00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:05.820
Because you have the rest of the week to not fail!

00:24:06.963 --> 00:24:08.063
Makes sense, right?

00:24:10.344 --> 00:24:15.726
Well, Ruffians, maybe there's a couple of you that are... What's natto?

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:21.688
Natto is a common breakfast food in Japan that's super duper duper healthy for you.

00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:24.889
But it's made of fermented soybeans.

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:29.971
And you know when soybeans get a bit fermented, meaning they get old.

00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:32.051
But they go old in a good way.

00:24:32.152 --> 00:24:33.192
This is a healthy old.

00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:37.055
It gets slimy and stinky.

00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:40.319
And a bit sticky too.

00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:47.346
But Moco-chan's gonna do her best to eat them because she wants to.

00:24:47.826 --> 00:24:49.007
She really does.

00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:54.152
Because she wants to be healthy and be able to protect your smile for a long time.

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.113
Just like me!

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.401
I have a problem right now, Ruffians.

00:24:58.961 --> 00:25:02.343
Because it's not the chopsticks I like.

00:25:03.264 --> 00:25:05.265
And I don't have- No excuses!

00:25:05.485 --> 00:25:07.466
We don't have any cough drops anymore.

00:25:07.486 --> 00:25:08.126
We ran out.

00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:09.787
We had a lot of cough drops.

00:25:09.947 --> 00:25:12.568
And I'm looking around for a thousand of them.

00:25:13.809 --> 00:25:16.030
And we don't have any more water.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:16.930
No.

00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:19.972
We do have sesame oil.

00:25:19.992 --> 00:25:21.633
I brought it as a backup though.

00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:33.673
Okay Moco-chan, I'm gonna stir it up so in the meantime, you say a big thank you to all the farmers in Tochigi, okay?

00:25:33.873 --> 00:25:35.335
I drank all the water.

00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.098
Oh, it's really sticky today.

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:41.341
Why does it have to be like this?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.081
It's really sticky today.

00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:46.042
Oh my god.

00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:48.783
Why does it have to be like this?

00:25:49.424 --> 00:25:51.285
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.266
It's all ready.

00:25:53.326 --> 00:25:55.207
Thank you, Torchiki Farmers.

00:25:55.827 --> 00:25:56.788
Here you are.

00:25:58.942 --> 00:25:59.882
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:26:00.082 --> 00:26:01.803
You're amazing!

00:26:01.843 --> 00:26:06.124
I haven't eaten anything yet, though.

00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:06.224
Okay!

00:26:06.804 --> 00:26:13.106
It's good enough just to, you know, think that today I'm gonna give it a good try, you know?

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:16.047
Moco-chan swallowed one bean last time.

00:26:16.127 --> 00:26:18.128
Can you do two?

00:26:18.508 --> 00:26:20.308
Two because it's our birthday.

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:25.210
Especially one for Poruru-oneechan on her birthday.

00:26:30.242 --> 00:26:32.063
I feel like I can't do it today.

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:35.606
Do you need a little bit of sesame oil?

00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:37.447
Yeah.

00:26:38.288 --> 00:26:41.790
Ruffians, should I allow a little bit of sesame oil today?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.311
A little bit of sesame oil.

00:26:43.391 --> 00:26:47.274
Especially because I don't have any water or cough drops or anything.

00:26:47.294 --> 00:26:49.195
Yeah?

00:26:50.857 --> 00:26:52.418
Just a tad, just a tad.

00:26:52.518 --> 00:26:55.300
Okay, got it.

00:26:57.081 --> 00:26:58.242
That was a good challenge.

00:26:58.482 --> 00:26:59.623
As much as I need.

00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:02.783
There's a tad.

00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:03.523
Just a smidgen.

00:27:06.265 --> 00:27:06.586
Okay.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.251
Stir it around, Moco-chan.

00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:14.532
No, I don't need to.

00:27:14.953 --> 00:27:15.433
Why?

00:27:15.453 --> 00:27:16.394
Cuz.

00:27:16.914 --> 00:27:19.036
Now the oil's just pooling at the bottom.

00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:20.117
It's fine.

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:23.140
I'm not gonna grab the beans at the bottom anyways.

00:27:24.221 --> 00:27:26.503
You just have one bean, are you sure?

00:27:26.523 --> 00:27:26.783
Yes.

00:27:27.543 --> 00:27:29.025
Ah, I feel bad for the oil.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.281
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:27:35.381 --> 00:27:37.603
Wow, the chopsticks are pretty dirty, huh?

00:27:38.103 --> 00:27:39.024
Very sticky.

00:27:39.044 --> 00:27:43.447
I don't like it.

00:27:43.467 --> 00:27:43.567
Okay.

00:27:43.587 --> 00:27:44.407
Don't be scared, Moco-chan!

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:46.489
Don't show the bean how afraid you are!

00:27:46.629 --> 00:27:47.009
I'm not!

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.589
I'm not!

00:27:47.689 --> 00:27:48.010
Okay.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.190
I got it!

00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:49.991
Okay!

00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:51.191
3... 2... 1!

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:56.175
It's in the... It's in the... Oh, oh!

00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:59.037
It's... Oh, it was kinda stuck to the chopsticks, but... Oh!

00:28:01.735 --> 00:28:03.276
Don't make that face, Moco-chan.

00:28:03.636 --> 00:28:04.557
You can do it!

00:28:05.238 --> 00:28:05.398
Oh!

00:28:06.238 --> 00:28:06.378
Oh!

00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:07.439
She's chilling.

00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:08.900
Chill, chill, chill.

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:12.403
Oh, oh no, oh no.

00:28:14.264 --> 00:28:15.105
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:16.425
Okay, part two!

00:28:16.466 --> 00:28:25.532
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:28:27.504 --> 00:28:28.405
What?

00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:29.946
I'm trying, Moco-chan.

00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:32.328
You can't just shove the natto at me.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.452
Part 2.

00:28:36.952 --> 00:28:38.233
You had a sip of water.

00:28:38.293 --> 00:28:39.754
Now it's time for part 2.

00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:41.135
No.

00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:42.777
I did good.

00:28:43.477 --> 00:28:45.759
That was... That was worse than last week.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.121
No, it's... I guess you chewed it.

00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:52.085
Are you getting used to the natto flavor yet?

00:28:55.387 --> 00:28:55.828
Maybe.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:02.121
You're not just saying that to make me go, oh, are you?

00:29:03.322 --> 00:29:03.642
No.

00:29:03.662 --> 00:29:11.828
And she slishes the water around.

00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:17.992
Don't cry, Moco-chan.

00:29:18.112 --> 00:29:18.613
I'm done.

00:29:20.151 --> 00:29:21.571
Well, Ruffians!

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:26.252
Don't forget to challenge something new this week!

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:27.233
Do your best!

00:29:27.253 --> 00:29:28.853
This is count as new!

00:29:29.273 --> 00:29:30.233
It's new!

00:29:30.794 --> 00:29:32.454
Because you're not giving up!

00:29:33.094 --> 00:29:37.755
Maybe, Ruffians, you know, you've been challenging yourself at something.

00:29:38.575 --> 00:29:40.456
Just continue at it, okay?

00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:41.696
I ate a bean.

00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:43.036
At one day, maybe.

00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:43.817
I ate it.

00:29:44.137 --> 00:29:48.398
When Moco-chan eats a whole pack of natto, you'll be a famous painter.

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:49.598
You never know.

00:29:50.973 --> 00:29:52.193
That'll have to start now.

00:29:53.754 --> 00:29:55.254
BAU BAU!

00:29:55.274 --> 00:29:57.375
BAU BAU!

00:29:57.415 --> 00:30:04.917
Well, for this week's Doggie of the Day, today we have... De-den!

00:30:05.197 --> 00:30:06.577
Barney!

00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:07.697
Oh.

00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:14.822
Damn!

00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:17.103
He's having some fun!

00:30:17.164 --> 00:30:18.725
Showing off those teeth!

00:30:19.305 --> 00:30:20.526
All that fluff!

00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:25.450
You know, he's making sure that everyone knows he's the life of the party, right?

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.071
Is that a yawn?

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:26.251
A yawn?

00:30:26.271 --> 00:30:26.391
Hungry?

00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:27.552
How does Buddy BAU BAU do you think?

00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:43.085
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:30:44.363 --> 00:30:44.844
Really?

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:47.188
Looks dangerous.

00:30:47.689 --> 00:30:49.712
Is that dangerous?

00:30:49.953 --> 00:30:54.180
Oh my gosh Ruffians, I think she's dangerous.

00:30:55.729 --> 00:30:57.270
And that's what Buddy sounds like!

00:30:59.492 --> 00:31:00.172
Just like that!

00:31:00.232 --> 00:31:03.254
Yeah, just like that!

00:31:03.274 --> 00:31:06.556
You know Buddy, Buddy is fluffy!

00:31:06.616 --> 00:31:07.817
Just like me!

00:31:08.277 --> 00:31:09.578
And ready for some fun!

00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:11.800
Just like me!

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.721
But a little bit different, you know.

00:31:13.741 --> 00:31:18.164
I think the dentists, they really appreciate it.

00:31:18.204 --> 00:31:19.545
They think it's pretty neat.

00:31:20.525 --> 00:31:27.531
Buddy comes on by because you know he's already smiling nice and wide before they even ask him to.

00:31:28.172 --> 00:31:29.313
That's pretty cool.

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:30.594
That's pretty nice.

00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:34.957
And I think Buddy loves it when you play robbers with him, you know.

00:31:35.258 --> 00:31:41.463
He's gonna come and take his toy back from you even if he has to get a little bit rough.

00:31:42.423 --> 00:31:44.765
Sometimes gotta be a bit rough, huh?

00:31:46.028 --> 00:31:47.430
Alright.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.172
BAU BAU!

00:31:50.232 --> 00:31:54.536
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:31:54.656 --> 00:31:57.178
We have... That!

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.182
Oh my gosh!

00:32:01.843 --> 00:32:02.743
It's so pretty.

00:32:02.843 --> 00:32:04.905
It's like a fairy house.

00:32:05.446 --> 00:32:06.246
But big!

00:32:06.427 --> 00:32:07.748
A fairy tale!

00:32:08.148 --> 00:32:10.390
And all that moss too.

00:32:13.288 --> 00:32:15.451
You think that the rice looks tasty?

00:32:17.398 --> 00:32:18.478
I guess I can see that.

00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:19.418
It's pretty fuzzy.

00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:20.839
Looks very lush.

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.339
Yeah.

00:32:22.739 --> 00:32:26.140
I don't know if I really feel like I want to eat it though.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.600
It's like dark souls.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.661
I think, you know, I prefer to just, you know, walk on up to that door and go knock knock knock, you know.

00:32:33.742 --> 00:32:34.582
Hello!

00:32:34.602 --> 00:32:37.062
Maybe check out what's inside.

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.003
It looks like a pillow.

00:32:40.023 --> 00:32:41.143
A pillow?

00:32:41.723 --> 00:32:42.783
Or the wall.

00:32:43.264 --> 00:32:45.044
I don't know if that's how it works, but...

00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:50.018
Well, we're glad you found something super cool on your walk.

00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:52.101
BAU BAU!

00:32:53.022 --> 00:32:55.907
And next we have our Question of the Day.

00:32:55.967 --> 00:32:59.012
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:02.966
How dear FUWAMOCO!

00:33:03.406 --> 00:33:10.269
In these trying times, we Ruffians are glad to have you to protect our smiles.

00:33:10.749 --> 00:33:14.851
But what would you say are the sure signs that a smile is protected?

00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:20.414
What if our face ends up tired and sore from smiling so much?

00:33:22.275 --> 00:33:24.416
This is a good question.

00:33:25.116 --> 00:33:29.178
A sure sign that a smile is protected, huh?

00:33:29.278 --> 00:33:29.518
Well...

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:40.876
First of all, I think it's important that Ruffians, you know, you got to bring your smile to us first so that we can protect it.

00:33:41.556 --> 00:33:42.097
Got it?

00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:46.863
So you bring it to us, and then we can protect it.

00:33:46.943 --> 00:33:48.966
But, you know what's fun?

00:33:50.054 --> 00:33:56.201
I don't know, I kind of think that maybe, you know, that depends on the individual, right?

00:33:56.561 --> 00:34:07.354
You know, it could be that your cheeks, they hurt more than usual, but it could also just be that maybe you feel a little more hopeful towards the future.

00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:10.257
Maybe even a little bit more energy, too.

00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:14.915
Like you got a really good sleep, you know?

00:34:14.935 --> 00:34:17.717
Nice pillow.

00:34:17.797 --> 00:34:22.400
We'd be happy if you felt that way, even just a little.

00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:25.542
We know that the world, it's a rough place.

00:34:25.902 --> 00:34:26.303
It's rough.

00:34:27.202 --> 00:34:31.183
We really hope that we can protect that smile of yours throughout your day.

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:32.883
Okay!

00:34:33.644 --> 00:34:35.124
It does feel like that!

00:34:35.204 --> 00:34:37.404
It does!

00:34:37.424 --> 00:34:38.905
That must be the sign then.

00:34:41.765 --> 00:34:43.746
BAU BAU!

00:34:44.286 --> 00:34:47.787
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:34:48.107 --> 00:34:48.767
Always!

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:52.288
For your questions, your Doggie of the Day.

00:34:53.248 --> 00:34:55.510
Your walks, your Pero Sightings.

00:34:55.891 --> 00:34:58.393
We're always, always looking for them.

00:34:58.433 --> 00:34:59.294
We're looking!

00:34:59.774 --> 00:35:01.957
Please don't forget, okay?

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:05.400
And thank you for your FUWAMOCO scoops!

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.384
We're always looking for more journalistic... We're looking!

00:35:09.784 --> 00:35:13.508
Observations from the Ruffians, so... Thank you!

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:13.928
Thank you!

00:35:13.948 --> 00:35:14.829
BAU BAU!

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:15.450
BAU BAU!

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.774
And for our next theme, we have... De-den!

00:35:20.374 --> 00:35:24.539
Our 6-month anniversary together with Advent!

00:35:24.779 --> 00:35:32.547
It's almost half a year since we became whole Advent together with Nomesa, Shiori, and Biboo!

00:35:34.157 --> 00:35:35.458
I really can't believe it.

00:35:35.518 --> 00:35:36.598
Where'd the time go, huh?

00:35:37.498 --> 00:35:38.318
But it's here!

00:35:38.538 --> 00:35:38.979
Yeah.

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:42.440
And we're gonna have some fun playing carded fun.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:49.362
Before we share a bit of an announcement together with you and all the Adventurers.

00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:51.342
Bit of an announcement?

00:35:51.422 --> 00:35:52.783
A bit of an announcement.

00:35:54.007 --> 00:35:55.689
It was so fun last time!

00:35:55.729 --> 00:35:56.970
Right, grinding boy?

00:35:57.771 --> 00:36:01.674
That'll be the second time, but I'm looking forward to it!

00:36:02.234 --> 00:36:04.256
BAU BAU!

00:36:05.277 --> 00:36:07.238
And our schedule!

00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:11.302
This week, if you didn't know, it's our birthday week!
