00:04:56.103 --> 00:05:01.919
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.552
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:13.915
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:15.197
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:18.343
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:18.363 --> 00:05:20.286
BAU BAU!

00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:25.996
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:27.258
Ruffians!

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:32.528
Thank you for joining us for our 142nd episode!

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:32.708
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:37.865
We're back, Ruffians!

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:41.972
It's been a while!

00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:42.272
BAU BAU!

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:44.496
We're so happy to be back finally!

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.599
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:57.177
For Ruffians maybe joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:05:57.377 --> 00:05:58.198
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:05:58.218 --> 00:05:59.961
And it's hosted by us!

00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:01.664
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:07.272
I aim this to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:08.294 --> 00:06:14.183
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:14.203 --> 00:06:17.809
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.992
BAU BAU!

00:06:19.972 --> 00:06:27.729
It's morning in your heart, right?

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.134
That's the important thing you know.

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:31.277
A new week?

00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:33.762
Almost a new month too!

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.279
Oh my gosh.

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:44.609
We hope that we'll make it a wonderful April together with you, Ruffians!

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.816
I love FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:48.996
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.080
Nihon wa shigatsu tsuitachi April furu!

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.841
Eh, mada!

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.467
Kokoro no naka wa mada.

00:06:56.248 --> 00:07:00.395
BAU BAU is not April Fools yet!

00:07:00.415 --> 00:07:00.475
No!

00:07:01.602 --> 00:07:05.168
BAU BAU!

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.151
It's not... Yeah.

00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:07.612
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.796
BAU BAU!

00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:11.018
More eyes.

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:13.021
Moco-chan, you're not April Fools!

00:07:14.063 --> 00:07:14.864
Not yet?

00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:16.888
What do we have today?

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:26.223
Not April Fools, we have some bad news.

00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:27.205
I thought that was right.

00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:29.791
April Fool's!

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:30.293
Right, Moco-chan?

00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:33.361
This is why you say April Fool's!

00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:34.544
April Fool's!

00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:39.357
No?

00:07:39.378 --> 00:07:39.558
Ruffians!

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.300
What?

00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:51.694
Why?

00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:56.845
Why do we have to start off our FUWAMOCO Morning this way, Moco-chan?

00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:57.527
It's important!

00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:58.108
It's important!

00:07:58.128 --> 00:08:01.856
The Ruffians need to be informed of us, I guess.

00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:05.945
Okay, well... Where was Pero spotted this time, Moco-chan?

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:07.789
Let's take a look.

00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:13.382
The birds!

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:20.432
When I went on a walk today, the birds looked like they were having a nice bath.

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.238
There's a weird bird in there with them.

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:25.940
Yeah?

00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:34.553
One of those birds is not a very... It's a nasty bird.

00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:43.343
Well, uh, hopefully he's just there for a bath and nothing more, you know.

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.266
We haven't seen him eat a bird before.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.992
But, I guess it could be possible.

00:08:52.254 --> 00:08:53.695
We just haven't seen it, you know.

00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:56.379
That is true.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.061
Maybe he already ate one.

00:08:58.161 --> 00:08:59.983
Poor Pero, no privacy.

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:14.751
I'm sure it won't go away.

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:24.925
He won't be any less nasty!

00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.214
BAU BAU.

00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:29.689
At least she's far away from us, huh?

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:34.088
I'm not gonna go take a bath in there with the birds.

00:09:35.114 --> 00:09:37.117
Let's not do that okay, Ruffians?

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:37.838
No.

00:09:37.858 --> 00:09:41.923
It looks cool anyway.

00:09:41.943 --> 00:09:42.103
BAU BAU!

00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:45.147
Wow, Ruffians!

00:09:45.688 --> 00:09:50.054
We're back and we have some news, some things to share!

00:09:50.394 --> 00:09:52.256
Let's step forward, Ruffians.

00:09:52.597 --> 00:09:54.780
We missed you!

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:57.804
We're back!

00:09:57.824 --> 00:09:58.965
We missed you so much!

00:09:58.985 --> 00:09:59.586
We're back!

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:01.210
FUWAMOCO's back!

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.377
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:09.770
You know, it was an especially rough March.

00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:18.250
You know, we had exciting things going on with FES and X-MON.

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:26.697
I happened to get super sick.

00:10:26.717 --> 00:10:26.817
Yeah.

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:28.038
It was whatever was going around!

00:10:28.058 --> 00:10:30.001
And, well, especially sick.

00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:31.923
Yeah.

00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:36.989
I had a bad fever and I couldn't speak or even make a sound.

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:38.351
It was really rough.

00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:39.512
I was whispering everywhere.

00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:40.333
It was really annoying.

00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:43.196
Couldn't hear me, Moco-chan.

00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:43.697
No!

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:57.299
But I'm still not 100% and I'm a little weak still, but I'm doing my best, so... You know, unfortunately we had a bunch of fun plans!

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.662
A bunch of fun streams!

00:10:59.583 --> 00:11:01.126
Right after first.

00:11:01.186 --> 00:11:03.730
We're gonna do this and that, you know!

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.254
But then things took a turn.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:06.795
Right!

00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:08.378
What was that?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:09.820
Yeah.

00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:22.816
But, uh, we didn't have a horror game festival, but Moco-chan at the very least, you were able to have your very first solo stream and you played Phasmophobia.

00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:24.118
I tried!

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.182
Yeah, it was something else.

00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:27.825
Something else!

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:29.428
Did you ever see the ghost?

00:11:32.632 --> 00:11:34.515
I don't think she ever saw the ghost, right?

00:11:35.516 --> 00:11:36.337
Door Simulator?

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:38.701
Yeah, the door was very scary apparently.

00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:41.745
Yeah, I did my best.

00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:44.389
It was a good stream, thank you!

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:55.005
Yeah, but, uh, well actually... We had to head back to the Moc Guy for some very important Demon Dog duties in the Northwest Passage.

00:11:55.806 --> 00:11:56.968
So...

00:11:56.948 --> 00:12:01.273
Yeah, that's what we've been kind of busy with, with the last little bit.

00:12:01.293 --> 00:12:05.538
Yeah, it was rough because we are going right from sick to makai.

00:12:05.898 --> 00:12:06.639
But we are still sick.

00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:08.081
Yeah.

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:16.411
It is way too fun to get in with you Ruffians, but we did our best to push ourselves and get everything done while we were there.

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:22.618
And you know, we were able to see mama puppy and papa puppy a bit too, so...

00:12:22.598 --> 00:12:25.601
Now we're back.

00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:28.164
We're back.

00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:41.918
There is still a bunch of homework to get done, but I'm looking forward to having some serious fun together with you Ruffians!

00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:44.341
Thank you for waiting for us to return, Ruffians!

00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:46.243
We missed you!

00:12:50.122 --> 00:12:57.313
We have some more news!

00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:07.968
Before we left, somehow, we're able to finally share a new song cover!

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:11.033
Here's some more!

00:13:11.013 --> 00:13:22.212
It's a first cover song for a while, but this time it's quite different from the songs that we've sung up until now.

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:22.974
Ruffians!

00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:25.678
What did you think of it?

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:31.689
It's a very small and emotional song, but this time it's in English!

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:32.209
English!

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.894
Yeah, not in Japanese.

00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:37.817
That's a good cover!

00:13:37.837 --> 00:13:38.237
Thank you!

00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:39.058
Amazing!

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:41.180
BAU BAU!

00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:43.342
You like that?

00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:44.282
Your favorite!

00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:46.545
I caught you tearing up!

00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:49.968
It's too early for tears, Ruffians!

00:13:49.988 --> 00:13:51.989
You like that it was in English this time?

00:13:54.432 --> 00:14:04.881
You know, as you might know, because a lot of our senpai have talked about it, but it's actually very, very hard for hololive English members to do covers of songs in English!

00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:12.949
But actually, Crescent Moon is originally a Japanese song with an official English translation.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.494
So it's a bit different.

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:17.284
Originally...

00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:21.888
It's a very famous J-pop song called Mikazuki by Ayaka.

00:14:22.409 --> 00:14:25.396
And that's why we're able to sing it this time.

00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:29.606
But it's really that hard.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.918
It's official lyrics.

00:14:34.898 --> 00:14:44.062
We still haven't been able to have an afterparty or talk about, you know, why we picked this song, what it means to us, you know, all the stuff about it.

00:14:44.563 --> 00:14:49.697
So we hope that you'll join us for an afterparty!

00:14:49.717 --> 00:14:51.321
We'll talk about it in the afterparty lots, okay?

00:14:51.301 --> 00:14:56.409
Ruffians, it makes us really happy if you could continue listening to it lots and lots!

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.271
We'll also talk about it in the afterparty.

00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:02.858
You know, our time away in the Northwest Pass is killing us.

00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:04.240
But thank you, Ruffians.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.366
Thank you for listening to it lots and lots while we are away.

00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:09.889
If you haven't listened to it yet, please go take a listen!

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:10.229
Go check it out!

00:15:10.249 --> 00:15:14.535
Maybe that's your theme song for this morning after FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:15:15.016 --> 00:15:17.680
It's not quite the right time, but it's okay.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.379
BAU BAU!

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.806
You listen to it again later?

00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:23.936
Thank you!

00:15:24.318 --> 00:15:25.966
Thank you!

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:26.488
BAU BAU!

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:30.745
I'm always happy to release new songs.

00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:33.991
I want to sing lots and lots.

00:15:34.592 --> 00:15:38.839
Hopefully there will be more in the future too.

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:50.299
Ruffians, while we were away, there was actually a very important announcement made from a beloved senpai of hololive English Promise.

00:15:50.954 --> 00:15:53.457
Wow, Nanashi Momoe.

00:15:53.557 --> 00:15:57.062
She announced that she will be graduating on April 27th.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.844
Yeah.

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:03.811
We're really, really sad to know that we'll be having to say goodbye so soon.

00:16:04.312 --> 00:16:05.293
Yeah.

00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:12.803
I'm sure you know, but she's just been such a sweet and lovely senpai and such an amazing singing voice.

00:16:12.823 --> 00:16:13.944
We're really gonna miss her.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:14.445
Yeah.

00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:15.827
She has such a great energy.

00:16:16.187 --> 00:16:16.908
Why?

00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:18.430
But...

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:24.097
We had a lot of fun playing Overwatch 2 and we got to hang out a bunch during fests.

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:29.543
But it's hard when you think you know that those times are limited now.

00:16:30.144 --> 00:16:35.210
It's funny because I feel like we spent a lot more time chatting and hanging out.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.532
Maybe I want to stream!

00:16:38.634 --> 00:16:44.080
Yeah, you know we did this together in the movies and that and you know all the magic.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:46.150
Dinner date.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.370
All right!

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.573
You know.

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.658
We thought together.

00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:51.139
Thanks a lot, Abyss!

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:53.023
And we chatted about this.

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:55.788
Yes, you know.

00:16:55.808 --> 00:16:55.928
Yeah.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:17:04.224
But we can only hope that you know, we'll have lots and lots of fun together before that day, you know.

00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:04.565
Yeah, so.

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:08.011
But we'll miss moving some pylons, not so.

00:17:08.212 --> 00:17:08.312
Yeah.

00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:14.405
Thank you FUWAMOCO for everything!

00:17:14.425 --> 00:17:15.006
It was a lot of fun!

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.991
We still have a month together!

00:17:17.011 --> 00:17:17.091
Yes!

00:17:17.111 --> 00:17:17.552
Be silly!

00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:21.762
Bye bye!

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.800
It's lonely, right?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.882
Make every moment count!

00:17:26.902 --> 00:17:29.545
Let's all do that every single day, okay?

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:32.168
BAU BAU!

00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:36.252
Also from hololive English Bonus!

00:17:36.673 --> 00:17:39.456
The Warden of Time, Kurenai-senpai!

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:45.582
She revealed a brand new outfit as part of her birthday celebration!

00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:47.505
Look at that silhouette!

00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:50.668
It looks pretty cute there!

00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:54.105
That we're very interested in.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:59.112
Maid cronies!

00:17:59.132 --> 00:17:59.212
Yes!

00:17:59.232 --> 00:18:04.339
Give me my new outfit and... Oh my gosh!

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.462
It's so cute!

00:18:06.482 --> 00:18:07.403
So cute, BAU BAU!

00:18:07.423 --> 00:18:11.810
Oh my gosh, how can my cronies have Barbie this cute?

00:18:13.712 --> 00:18:14.333
But, I can't.

00:18:14.353 --> 00:18:20.942
Look, look, you know... There's so many different types of maids and maid outfits, but you know, I...

00:18:20.922 --> 00:18:25.287
A type of meat that strikes us the most deeply.

00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:30.392
Inside of our hearts.

00:18:30.412 --> 00:18:30.873
Is this one right here?

00:18:30.893 --> 00:18:31.634
Yeah, you know.

00:18:31.874 --> 00:18:35.278
Victoria-style meat that goes down to the ankles.

00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:41.745
You know it's very high quality, lean, simple, black and white.

00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:45.469
And she made it for us.

00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:45.869
She made it for us!

00:18:45.889 --> 00:18:46.130
It's for us!

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.191
She made it for us!

00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:48.172
You know it.

00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:48.993
Ready, baby!

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:50.134
What?

00:18:50.154 --> 00:18:50.254
What?

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.335
Huh?

00:18:55.355 --> 00:18:55.495
Nobody.

00:18:55.515 --> 00:18:55.755
No.

00:18:55.895 --> 00:18:56.616
You know her.

00:18:57.237 --> 00:18:58.258
Look, you know her.

00:19:02.382 --> 00:19:03.343
She can't even hide behind her hair!

00:19:03.363 --> 00:19:04.144
Bridge!

00:19:04.785 --> 00:19:10.210
The last bridge that go down near the... I thought, I thought... They're a little bit messy, but that's because she's been working so hard around the mansion.

00:19:10.491 --> 00:19:11.332
I wanted bridge.

00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:15.276
When I saw the silhouette, I thought I wanted bridge, but she can't have bridge.

00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:17.338
That's too much for me.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:29.685
FUWAMOCO have a mansion?

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:33.994
I have a mansion inside my delusions!

00:19:34.413 --> 00:19:40.999
I want to do so much FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:43.442
I want to run underneath her skirt there and put the legs.

00:19:43.462 --> 00:19:45.624
I want to get in the way of all the cleaning.

00:19:45.724 --> 00:19:47.766
I want to sleep in the sun on her lap.

00:19:49.247 --> 00:19:52.270
Maybe play with the little pumpkin watch that's here.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:58.096
I want to pull on the sides of the dress and be like, this way, this way!

00:19:58.116 --> 00:19:58.937
I want to rip off the couch!

00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:00.238
Look at the strings there, Moco-chan!

00:20:00.258 --> 00:20:02.440
I'm just going to take it right away and then hide it.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.441
Right, right.

00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:06.125
You'll hide it behind the rose bush.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.548
That's the perfect place for Moco-chan.

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:09.390
Exactly!

00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:13.115
It's so cute.

00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:16.640
The only thing left is glasses.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.942
But we can just imagine though.

00:20:17.962 --> 00:20:24.091
You know, if we had glasses, I think, you know, it's probably for the best because otherwise we'd be dead, right Moco-chan?

00:20:24.752 --> 00:20:27.796
That's so good of a general feeling.

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:28.557
I have no words!

00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:32.803
If anybody wants to, you know, maybe draw,

00:20:33.627 --> 00:20:37.559
FUWAMOCO and me cronies are adventurers.

00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:39.846
There's ideas.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.092
Lots of ideas.

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:44.941
More ideas.

00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:46.405
Can definitely share with you.

00:20:47.448 --> 00:21:12.915
BAU BAU!

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.444
Now, I'm maybe not so happy.

00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:18.888
We have Ruffians!

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:27.702
We saw on Twitter that there's a very controversial graph going around.

00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:32.490
Let's take a look.

00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:34.912
Whoa!

00:21:35.573 --> 00:21:43.863
Apparently, this is a graph of a whole young member's land depending on height to gain more energy.

00:21:43.883 --> 00:21:46.407
How do height and gain more energy rhyme?

00:21:46.627 --> 00:21:47.748
Why is it more complex?

00:21:47.768 --> 00:21:48.650
I don't know why height.

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:50.953
Gain more energy.

00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:52.555
You see this, Ruffians?

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:56.720
I have a question.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:58.883
What's the question?

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.503
Why are we all on the side away from the camera?

00:22:09.981 --> 00:22:10.442
Why?

00:22:11.738 --> 00:22:12.419
Huh?

00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:14.022
What is gamer energy?

00:22:14.443 --> 00:22:16.968
It's not gamer skills.

00:22:16.988 --> 00:22:17.168
Yeah.

00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:18.691
It's energy!

00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:19.773
Yeah.

00:22:20.855 --> 00:22:21.676
Huh?

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:23.339
Don't we have lots of that?

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:27.507
Ruffians, lots of love, lots of energy for gamers!

00:22:27.968 --> 00:22:29.972
We're retro gamers, you know it!

00:22:29.992 --> 00:22:30.753
Retro gamers, that's FUWAMOCO!

00:22:30.773 --> 00:22:32.356
It's not about skills, it's about energy.

00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:32.937
Yeah.

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:36.962
You see my FPS gamer energy, right?

00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:38.063
You see that, right?

00:22:38.844 --> 00:22:41.167
If that's not gamer energy, I don't know what that is.

00:22:41.428 --> 00:22:41.788
Right?

00:22:41.808 --> 00:22:43.991
Obviously, this chart is very wrong.

00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:45.293
Right, Ruffians?

00:22:45.313 --> 00:22:46.314
You agree, right?

00:22:47.676 --> 00:22:49.898
You have lots of love for games.

00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:53.923
Maybe not skills, but... Energy!

00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:56.507
Energy!

00:22:56.527 --> 00:22:59.110
Yes, it's super wrong, yes.

00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:00.294
Yeah.

00:23:00.314 --> 00:23:01.678
Yeah.

00:23:01.698 --> 00:23:01.919
Yeah!

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:02.561
You agree?

00:23:02.822 --> 00:23:07.214
Well we have more proof of what's wrong!

00:23:07.234 --> 00:23:07.535
We have proof!

00:23:07.555 --> 00:23:07.997
Actual evidence!

00:23:08.418 --> 00:23:09.260
Yes!

00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:11.146
Because!

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:11.547
Wow!

00:23:13.045 --> 00:23:14.468
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:21.020
We're gonna be guests at Holo Gamers Fest!

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.163
At Saitama Super Arena 2!

00:23:23.404 --> 00:23:24.947
Gamers 2!

00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:29.535
Gamers is gonna be doing a big gaming event!

00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:35.605
FUWAMOCO will be there on day 2!

00:23:40.813 --> 00:23:46.001
Along with Subaru-senpai and Mikocchi-senpai.

00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:48.345
Fuwamiko!

00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:52.792
Fuwamiko and Fuwamiko!

00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:54.595
We're gonna play games all together!

00:23:54.575 --> 00:24:10.255
FUWAMOCO

00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:11.358
It's super!

00:24:11.378 --> 00:24:12.981
It's a super arena!

00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:18.975
I think it's the third largest arena in the world?

00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:21.681
Something crazy like that?

00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:23.064
It's big!

00:24:23.084 --> 00:24:23.926
Very big!

00:24:24.447 --> 00:24:26.492
Yeah yeah yeah!

00:24:26.512 --> 00:24:27.113
Way way big!

00:24:27.093 --> 00:24:32.140
So we're gonna play games then!

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:37.708
And there's not only streaming tickets for the event as well, but there's also in-person tickets!

00:24:37.808 --> 00:24:40.912
So Ruffians excited that they got their tickets!

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:46.460
But you know, if you haven't yet, please apply for the lottery!

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.601
Please get them!

00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:51.086
Streaming tickets will be available, so please check it out!

00:24:51.106 --> 00:24:51.967
Don't miss it!

00:24:51.987 --> 00:24:55.412
It's gonna be very silly and chaotic for sure!

00:24:55.831 --> 00:24:57.825
I have a feeling, yeah.

00:24:58.227 --> 00:25:28.234
FUWAMOCO has gamer energy.

00:25:28.214 --> 00:25:30.577
No misunderstandings.

00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:30.657
No.

00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:30.737
No.

00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:32.279
It's not even a misunderstanding yet.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:32.880
It's clear.

00:25:33.301 --> 00:25:37.567
Yeah.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.930
Yeah.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.110
BAU BAU!

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.410
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:43.214
You know, it's a new week.

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:44.015
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:25:44.035 --> 00:25:47.620
And that means there's gotta be a Doggie of the Day, right?

00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:48.461
Wow.

00:25:48.782 --> 00:25:51.145
Let's take a look at today's Doggie of the Day.

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:54.289
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:25:55.535 --> 00:25:58.100
De-den!

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.061
It's Pelusa!

00:25:59.242 --> 00:26:01.085
BAU BAU!

00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:02.067
It's time!

00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:03.349
Right!

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:05.232
Pelusa's a new puppy!

00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:07.657
New family member!

00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:08.298
New family!

00:26:08.418 --> 00:26:12.726
But apparently Pelusa means fluffy or fuzzy in Spanish.

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:13.307
Pelusa!

00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:14.929
Melissa!

00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:17.413
Look at those ears to the tail!

00:26:17.433 --> 00:26:19.796
I feel like the paws are so big!

00:26:20.117 --> 00:26:25.544
Apparently, despite her tiny size, she has a big attitude.

00:26:25.564 --> 00:26:27.407
Yeah, very cute.

00:26:27.647 --> 00:26:29.310
I can see it in the eyes there.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.212
The stance as well.

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:33.936
Power stance.

00:26:34.477 --> 00:26:37.742
Moco-chan, how does Melissa bow-bow?

00:26:41.447 --> 00:26:41.607
Bow-bow!

00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:48.643
Bye bye!

00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:51.258
Huh?

00:26:52.781 --> 00:26:55.225
You think it's so rough?

00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:56.106
It's so silly.

00:26:57.669 --> 00:27:00.433
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:01.435
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:05.502
FUWAMOCO is still just the size of a little boy, but she has attitude!

00:27:05.923 --> 00:27:07.505
She has presence!

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:08.166
It's important, yes!

00:27:08.186 --> 00:27:09.188
Yeah, and you know her!

00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:15.238
She'll be an even bigger silly when she becomes a full-grown doggy too!

00:27:15.218 --> 00:27:21.130
Please give her lots of high fives and cheats for us, okay?

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:21.310
BAU BAU!

00:27:22.933 --> 00:27:27.422
And Ruffians, you have to make sure to keep those paws out going for walks, right?

00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:29.506
Right, and no sprinkles here!

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:30.368
It's purple!

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:34.516
Wow, let's take a look at where this Ruffian went on a walk.

00:27:34.596 --> 00:27:37.682
Today I went on a walk.

00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:39.726
Have a day!

00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:42.010
Daffodils!

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.192
I love daffodils!

00:27:44.074 --> 00:27:45.697
These are Moco-chan.

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.584
I think these are yellow narcissus.

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:52.008
Is this not daffodils?

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:53.651
I thought these were always daffodils.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:54.814
I thought they were daffodils.

00:27:54.854 --> 00:27:56.136
Moco-chan daffodils.

00:27:56.156 --> 00:27:57.058
Daffodils!

00:27:57.418 --> 00:27:59.923
Maybe it's like a bouncier daffodil.

00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:04.743
Wow, idling is super pretty!

00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:06.585
It feels like spring 100%!

00:28:06.605 --> 00:28:07.847
100%.

00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:08.187
1000%!

00:28:08.507 --> 00:28:15.876
Look at the eggs down there.

00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:17.178
Natural.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:18.720
Natural?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.301
That's what you see in nature.

00:28:20.321 --> 00:28:22.764
At the bottom of flowers, there's always eggs.

00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:24.386
Oh, yeah.

00:28:24.727 --> 00:28:28.912
You know, especially FUWAMOCO egg plushies.

00:28:28.932 --> 00:28:30.113
Ah, love it!

00:28:30.565 --> 00:28:32.911
Excited to be booming with you.

00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:38.725
Did you just say excited, Moco-chan?

00:28:38.845 --> 00:28:41.051
Stop.

00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:44.359
Thank you for taking us on your springtime walk!

00:28:44.379 --> 00:28:44.760
BAU BAU!

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:47.241
No more, Moco-chan!

00:28:47.281 --> 00:28:47.961
No more!

00:28:47.981 --> 00:28:49.163
I didn't say anything.

00:28:49.183 --> 00:28:52.786
I didn't say anything.

00:28:52.806 --> 00:28:52.966
BAU BAU!

00:28:52.986 --> 00:28:57.391
After our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:28:57.891 --> 00:29:01.135
When did you first notice you were feeling unwell?

00:29:01.335 --> 00:29:05.239
Did you both get sick at the same time, or did one of you fall ill first?

00:29:05.699 --> 00:29:08.782
Get well soon!

00:29:08.802 --> 00:29:08.963
BAU BAU!

00:29:08.983 --> 00:29:11.305
I think this time, it was...

00:29:11.993 --> 00:29:21.207
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:21.327 --> 00:29:34.086
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:35.196
Yeah.

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:40.402
But you know, by the end of the day we had a very fun day.

00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:42.164
I was feeling very rough.

00:29:43.005 --> 00:29:44.086
Yeah.

00:29:44.106 --> 00:29:47.330
And actually we had even more plans for fun later.

00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:53.938
But they got cancelled because all of us were really sick.

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:54.458
We were not feeling well!

00:29:54.478 --> 00:29:56.561
But let's cancel our plans.

00:29:56.841 --> 00:30:00.926
But you know... I'd totally be able to get to see everybody more!

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:01.046
Yeah!

00:30:01.607 --> 00:30:04.410
But I don't think that was the last time then, huh?

00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:12.319
I know FUWAMOCO!

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.155
Generally when it comes to sickness...

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:20.486
If one of us is not feeling great, the other one is, you know.

00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:22.148
Yeah, not feeling great either.

00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:26.716
You know, even things for like headaches and stuff too.

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:26.836
Yeah.

00:30:27.057 --> 00:30:28.379
It makes sense.

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:33.667
Yeah, this time is a little bit rare because Moco-chan, you're doing much better than me.

00:30:34.148 --> 00:30:37.013
Not great, but still, I was not doing well.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.438
But I'm glad to be doing much, much better now.

00:30:43.458 --> 00:30:48.409
Mostly better now, but I'm still gonna make sure to take it easy, Ruffians.

00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:51.797
Please forgive me if I sound stumped up.

00:30:52.719 --> 00:30:55.405
Maybe I have to mute off, you know?

00:30:56.928 --> 00:30:58.191
Sounds like a dog.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.942
BAU BAU!

00:31:02.082 --> 00:31:04.546
BAU BAU!

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:07.851
Thank you so much for all your submissions, FUWAMOCO!

00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:08.091
Thank you!

00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:11.497
Please remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together!

00:31:11.537 --> 00:31:13.920
The morning together with you!

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.184
So we're always looking for more submissions.

00:31:16.784 --> 00:31:17.225
Don't need these.

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:19.549
Doesn't need to have to be your doggy.

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:21.612
Just send it with the hashtag.

00:31:21.752 --> 00:31:22.693
I saw this dog.

00:31:22.954 --> 00:31:24.055
Yeah, you know.

00:31:24.476 --> 00:31:25.798
Maybe it's best to ask for it, Fuwara.

00:31:25.778 --> 00:31:30.225
But you know, also lots of springtime things going on.

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:33.030
Good opportunity for some nice walks.

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:36.696
Also, Ruffians, I know you have questions.

00:31:36.736 --> 00:31:42.225
It's been quite a while since we did a Q&A, so please send us your questions.

00:31:42.245 --> 00:31:45.510
And also, it is too, let us know what you thought.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.852
Please use the hashtag.

00:31:47.172 --> 00:31:50.017
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:52.541
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:31:52.561 --> 00:31:53.102
BAU BAU!

00:31:53.082 --> 00:31:59.795
What do we have for our next stream?

00:31:59.896 --> 00:32:00.276
What do we?

00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:03.042
We haven't released a schedule or anything.

00:32:04.885 --> 00:32:10.737
Ruffians, maybe you'd like to take a look at a little bit of a schedule.

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:18.449
Let's take a look!

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:19.811
De-den!

00:32:20.973 --> 00:32:24.899
Our next stream is gonna be tomorrow!

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.368
We're having an advent collab.

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:33.113
Question mark.

00:32:33.295 --> 00:32:38.413
You have to join us, Ruffians!

00:32:42.207 --> 00:32:45.499
Ignore the fact that it's on the 1st, okay?

00:32:46.829 --> 00:32:57.407
And on this day we have another FUWAMOCO Morning followed by finally a Crescent Moon song cover release after party!

00:32:57.988 --> 00:33:06.863
We wanted to chat about it and chat about you know our time in the Northwest Passage a little bit too so please join us for just you know some nice chatting.

00:33:06.843 --> 00:33:25.088
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:34.416
And on Friday, we have another FUWAMOCO Morning with you, Ruffians!

00:33:34.436 --> 00:33:35.297
Followed by some Donkey Kong Country tunes!

00:33:35.738 --> 00:33:36.099
It's been a while!

00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:41.889
Speaking of been a while... Little Witch Nobita is back, Ruffians!

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.490
Remember?

00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:46.097
Ruffians, do you remember when we were in Nobita?

00:33:46.077 --> 00:33:47.319
Do you?

00:33:47.339 --> 00:33:47.780
Do you remember?

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.463
Do you remember we played that game before?

00:33:49.964 --> 00:33:52.289
Probably a long time ago.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:53.290
Right!

00:33:53.311 --> 00:33:55.655
We started it back when we just debuted!

00:33:55.955 --> 00:33:56.957
Yeah!

00:33:57.899 --> 00:34:01.526
Are we gonna finish it this time, Moco-chan?

00:34:01.546 --> 00:34:02.327
Do you remember it?

00:34:02.347 --> 00:34:02.428
Wow!

00:34:02.648 --> 00:34:03.309
That's good!

00:34:04.852 --> 00:34:06.455
Because we'll have a summary!

00:34:06.475 --> 00:34:08.258
We'll be able to fill the Ruffians in!

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:09.621
Because...

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.193
We don't have our data.

00:34:12.914 --> 00:34:14.898
So Moco-chan's job now.

00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:20.348
You're gonna do your best to re-learn where we were with the story of the game.

00:34:20.368 --> 00:34:22.873
And then we'll be starting back off where we were.

00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:26.079
I don't know where my data is!

00:34:27.682 --> 00:34:27.762
Why?

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:33.712
But it'll be okay because Moco-chan, you couldn't be getting so caught up.

00:34:34.153 --> 00:34:36.095
I couldn't be a gamer, okay?

00:34:36.396 --> 00:34:37.498
Yes.

00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:43.827
I was thinking of getting back to where I was.

00:34:43.847 --> 00:34:44.608
Off stream.

00:34:48.975 --> 00:34:49.696
That's the plan.

00:34:50.056 --> 00:34:54.042
And then, hopefully Ruffians will be able to beat Nobeta!

00:34:54.082 --> 00:34:57.107
All together on Saturday.

00:34:57.982 --> 00:35:04.908
And then on Sunday we'll be having a Question Question Question Mic Off Club.

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:08.031
Question Question Question Mic Channel!

00:35:09.172 --> 00:35:10.293
We're looking forward to it.

00:35:10.313 --> 00:35:18.580
It's very early in the morning so maybe Ruffians, instead of hoarding your sleep schedule, maybe you can join us in the archive for that one.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.442
But if you happen to be awake, please join us!

00:35:21.462 --> 00:35:24.505
And then on Sunday we'll be doing a super chat reading.

00:35:24.805 --> 00:35:27.988
And just chatting about a bunch of different things that's been on our minds.

00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:31.933
You know, and hearing how things have been for you too, Ruffians!

00:35:31.953 --> 00:35:36.599
You know, maybe you're back from your trip to Japan, or maybe you went on another trip!

00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:40.024
Let us know how things have been going for you, you know?

00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:42.407
We miss you!

00:35:42.887 --> 00:35:48.795
So take a little bit of a moment to slow down a little bit and just have a nice time together.

00:35:48.775 --> 00:35:51.359
And that's our schedule for this week.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.123
BAU BAU!

00:35:54.644 --> 00:35:59.592
I'm so excited to be able to, you know, have some fun together with Advent very soon.

00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:05.381
It'll be nice being able to play some games too, together!

00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:06.943
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:13.914
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive today, we have your FUWAMOCO word for you!

00:36:14.716 --> 00:36:15.036
It's...

00:36:15.016 --> 00:36:16.818
BAU BAU!

00:36:16.838 --> 00:36:18.139
We miss you!

00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:20.962
BAU BAU!

00:36:20.982 --> 00:36:23.105
Thank you!

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:24.106
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:24.126 --> 00:36:28.711
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:28.991 --> 00:36:35.838
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:36:36.339 --> 00:36:37.180
Rufficron!

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.841
BAU BAU!

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:39.943
Fingon!

00:36:40.583 --> 00:36:41.344
BAU BAU!

00:36:41.324 --> 00:37:01.307
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

00:37:01.287 --> 00:37:29.995
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:32.105
Good morning!
