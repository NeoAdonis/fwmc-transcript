05:23.309 --> 05:26.431

05:36.841 --> 05:39.304
Thank you for joining us today, Ruffians.

05:39.324 --> 05:43.208
It's the end of the week, but it's also the 116th episode!

05:43.228 --> 05:44.249
Not the 115th, no.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.260
Earlier.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.181
Funtime.

05:56.061 --> 05:58.622
Oh my son, it's the 116th episode!

05:58.802 --> 05:59.342

Thank you, Ruffians, for always being here with us in the morning!

06:07.125 --> 06:07.245
Bye!

06:08.495 --> 06:13.820
Maybe some Ruffians, maybe it's been a little while since your last FUWAMOCO Morning?

06:13.900 --> 06:16.702
Yeah, it needed a bit of a refresher.

06:16.762 --> 06:23.669
Wow, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:23.989 --> 06:24.309
A.K.A.

06:24.449 --> 06:25.510
FUWAMOCO!

06:26.151 --> 06:27.192
And it's hosted by us.

06:27.852 --> 06:29.212
FUWAMOCO!

06:29.752 --> 06:35.594
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:35.994 --> 06:41.855
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:42.115 --> 06:46.036
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:46.056 --> 06:49.096
BAU BAU!

06:49.116 --> 06:53.377
Are you having a good morning so far, Ruffians?

06:53.417 --> 06:55.678
Pressing the hashtag, hashtag button?

06:55.738 --> 06:56.338
Hashtag.

06:56.458 --> 06:56.918
Hashtag.

06:57.878 --> 06:58.439
Hashtag.

06:58.799 --> 06:59.059
Hi.

06:59.440 --> 06:59.720
Ya.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.164
What if you wanna start your day off on the left paw?

07:04.284 --> 07:04.625
No!

07:06.426 --> 07:07.667
Oh, my answer is different.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.351
If you wanna start your day off on the left paw, go!

07:11.711 --> 07:13.513
Go for it!

07:14.854 --> 07:17.156
If that will make you smile the most.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.099
You need to start on the right paw, okay?

07:20.119 --> 07:21.080
Not the left one.

07:22.843 --> 07:23.483
Okay, Moco-chan.

07:23.683 --> 07:25.004
Only the right paw.

07:25.024 --> 07:26.344
You go for it, Ruffians.

07:26.365 --> 07:30.366
The left paw is some... You know sometimes it's good to kinda change things up, you know?

07:30.386 --> 07:32.127
Ah, not get unbalanced.

07:32.447 --> 07:33.307
Right, you know.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.068
Left paw!

07:34.488 --> 07:34.588
No.

07:35.202 --> 07:35.883
Right paw.

07:36.343 --> 07:36.583
Yes.

07:37.344 --> 07:37.904
Left paw.

07:38.384 --> 07:38.564
Ah!

07:38.684 --> 07:41.647
Then, Fuwawa's left paw, Moco-chan's right paw.

07:41.707 --> 07:42.347
Yeah!

07:42.367 --> 07:43.087
BAU BAU!

07:43.168 --> 07:44.689
BAU BAU!

07:44.709 --> 07:44.869
I'm done!

07:44.929 --> 07:45.929
That means both paws equal.

07:56.627 --> 07:58.128
A big weekend's coming up!

07:58.148 --> 07:58.748
Yeah!

07:59.269 --> 08:00.570
But we have bad news!

08:00.950 --> 08:01.150
What?

08:02.351 --> 08:03.371
Nothing's been cancelled, why?

08:05.689 --> 08:06.109
No?

08:06.129 --> 08:07.390
What is that?

08:09.831 --> 08:10.932
Apparently... What?

08:10.952 --> 08:13.693
There's been a Pero Sighting.

08:13.873 --> 08:14.894
A Pero Sighting!

08:16.975 --> 08:18.095
That's what we have here!

08:19.076 --> 08:19.896
Where's the picture?

08:20.276 --> 08:21.537
Let's see where he is then.

08:21.917 --> 08:25.379
De-den!

08:27.140 --> 08:27.800
Nothing's there.

08:29.088 --> 08:29.308
Huh?

08:29.948 --> 08:30.889
Still no Pero?

08:30.989 --> 08:31.249
Huh?

08:31.769 --> 08:32.529
Ruffians!

08:32.889 --> 08:35.931
We heard he had a birthday party.

08:36.671 --> 08:37.091
Right.

08:37.251 --> 08:37.631
Huh?

08:38.992 --> 08:39.712
Where is he?

08:39.732 --> 08:40.512
Huh?

08:40.852 --> 08:43.453
Why didn't you take a photo of the birthday boy, huh?

08:44.934 --> 08:45.214
Huh?

08:46.134 --> 08:50.916
Well, uh, maybe he like escaped before the Ruffians could get a photo.

08:51.336 --> 08:53.057
Maybe he's off somewhere again.

08:55.318 --> 08:55.638
I don't know.

08:55.718 --> 08:57.159
He was supposed to be back.

08:57.279 --> 08:58.460
Are you sure about that?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.782
Maybe he's preparing for something important.

09:02.022 --> 09:02.522
Huh?

09:02.682 --> 09:04.863
The Pero have important things to do.

09:04.883 --> 09:07.145
I don't know.

09:07.445 --> 09:08.765
He's doing research.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.748
You can ask him what kind of research.

09:16.450 --> 09:16.690
Well...

09:17.635 --> 09:18.336
We'll have to see.

09:18.356 --> 09:19.817
BAU BAU.

09:19.897 --> 09:21.019
BAU BAU!

09:21.459 --> 09:23.081
Next time make sure you take a picture, okay?

09:23.121 --> 09:25.043
Picture says if that one works or not.

09:25.083 --> 09:25.904
Then we know!

09:26.344 --> 09:27.446
Exactly where he is.

09:28.687 --> 09:31.330
And... Fuwamoco doesn't need to worry about it.

09:31.350 --> 09:31.810
Yeah!

09:31.930 --> 09:32.952
BAU BAU!

09:33.032 --> 09:34.073
BAU BAU!

09:34.293 --> 09:35.534
Well, we'll see!

09:35.554 --> 09:36.035
Good news!

09:36.135 --> 09:36.996
Good news!

09:38.217 --> 09:38.817
The season.

09:39.478 --> 09:40.238
It's summer!

09:40.358 --> 09:41.118
It's summer!

09:41.158 --> 09:42.799
Finally summer!

09:42.819 --> 09:43.719
And you know what?

09:44.380 --> 09:50.742
We're spending it together with you, our teacher, having fun on a summer camp too!

09:50.822 --> 09:51.622
BAU BAU!

09:51.722 --> 09:52.363
BAU BAU!

09:53.583 --> 09:54.264
Oh no!

09:54.344 --> 09:55.045
Voice pack!

09:55.205 --> 09:56.567
Academy voice pack!

09:57.467 --> 10:00.430
The Academy voice pack series is back!

10:00.451 --> 10:01.091
It's back!

10:01.231 --> 10:02.753
FUWAMOCO it is!

10:02.773 --> 10:04.535
FUWAMOCO!

10:04.635 --> 10:09.640
They're in our bathing suits together with Noel-senpai and Kanata-senpai!

10:09.660 --> 10:10.020
Yeah!

10:10.060 --> 10:10.921
The key visual!

10:10.941 --> 10:11.322
Right!

10:11.842 --> 10:13.344
BAU BAU!

10:13.604 --> 10:17.408
You know, it was just released out early in the morning, Ruffians.

10:17.448 --> 10:18.029
Really?

10:18.089 --> 10:20.672
But how many of you got your paws on it yet?

10:20.692 --> 10:21.513
Cute!

10:21.853 --> 10:24.596
You saw it, you saw it!

10:24.937 --> 10:30.022
Moco-chan, you're having trouble with a little crab on your head there.

10:30.042 --> 10:31.824
I was feeling a bit crabby, huh?

10:33.260 --> 10:35.062
Oh, there's a lot in them!

10:35.182 --> 10:36.223
You just got it!

10:36.924 --> 10:37.685
Oh, really!

10:37.765 --> 10:39.186
Oh, what did you think, Ruffians?

10:39.346 --> 10:41.388
Oh, you might take it out!

10:42.009 --> 10:44.411
Yeah, we got Fluffy the Fuzzy!

10:45.893 --> 10:47.675
Silver hair, silver hair.

10:49.869 --> 10:50.990
But yeah!

10:52.932 --> 10:53.632
I know!

10:53.772 --> 11:02.898
This time if you want you can check out my introduction video and then kind of see what kind of things happen on a summer trip.

11:03.039 --> 11:10.544
So maybe spicy situations like feeding flowers on shaved ice and uh...

11:11.993 --> 11:13.736
Putting sunscreen on me.

11:13.776 --> 11:15.419
Is sunscreen spicy?

11:15.439 --> 11:17.142
Is shaved ice spicy?

11:17.182 --> 11:19.366
Shaved ice is sweet, Moco-chan.

11:19.386 --> 11:22.912
In what situation is shaved ice spicy?

11:24.503 --> 11:25.523
Well, Ruffians!

11:25.863 --> 11:33.665
If you wanna get an even better listen, you can go to the official hololive shop and listen to some sample voices there!

11:34.005 --> 11:35.786
And then you'll know exactly- Oh!

11:35.846 --> 11:37.546
This is where the voice pack is!

11:37.586 --> 11:37.886
Right?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.006
You might be curious, huh?

11:39.026 --> 11:40.507
We also recorded that, huh?

11:40.527 --> 11:43.748
We recorded it in English and Japanese, so you can- Oh!

11:44.088 --> 11:45.768
What's the difference between them?

11:45.788 --> 11:49.869
You can also have a listen to some of our Senpai's voice packs too!

11:50.109 --> 11:51.489
And their special voices too!

11:54.990 --> 12:00.333
But we always put lots of love and effort into our voice packs, so please go ahead and take them out, okay?

12:00.513 --> 12:02.994
We wanna hear what you thought, okay, Ruffians?

12:03.114 --> 12:04.995
Yeah, you know the academy.

12:05.035 --> 12:07.737
The academy series has been going for a little while now.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.618
A little bit now, but you can jump in now.

12:09.858 --> 12:10.958
Yeah, I know.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.720
But I hear there's some mysterious exchange soon.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.441
It's too hot.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.102
So you can always jump in, okay?

12:17.122 --> 12:17.982
BAU BAU!

12:18.222 --> 12:19.123
BAU BAU!

12:22.004 --> 12:22.924
Wow!

12:22.964 --> 12:24.485
The summer continues.

12:25.085 --> 12:36.550
And this summer, in only just a few weeks from now, hololive English, we're holding our second concert, Breaking Dimensions, in New York City!

12:36.590 --> 12:37.811
Yeah!

12:37.891 --> 12:38.951
BAU BAU!

12:39.372 --> 12:40.372
What's this?

12:40.552 --> 12:41.052
What's this?

12:41.192 --> 12:42.273
FUWAMOCO after...

12:43.260 --> 12:46.582
Making our brand new 3D debut this weekend!

12:46.602 --> 12:47.402
This weekend!

12:47.502 --> 12:52.345
Of course, we'll be performing there with all of Advent as well!

12:52.365 --> 12:52.445
Yeah!

12:53.046 --> 12:54.647
Yeah, let's go!

12:54.667 --> 12:56.848
Bum bum bum bum!

12:56.888 --> 13:00.390
There's a lot of excitement going on, I think, Ruffians.

13:00.850 --> 13:10.416
But to get you pumped up even more, there's going to be an official program for the concert on the hololive English channel on YouTube here!

13:10.456 --> 13:11.636
The official one.

13:11.676 --> 13:12.457
The official one.

13:13.097 --> 13:18.324
Not the official one.

13:18.444 --> 13:21.688
You know, maybe there's some new extra information.

13:21.948 --> 13:24.371
Oh yeah, we haven't heard much for a little while.

13:24.391 --> 13:24.952
Right?

13:25.353 --> 13:28.196
You know, Ruffians got their tickets.

13:28.256 --> 13:29.518
Maybe for your streaming.

13:30.458 --> 13:35.284
But it's right before our 3D debut, so it's gonna be a very exciting day, okay?

13:35.945 --> 13:40.310
Yeah, it's happening right before our 3D debut.

13:40.390 --> 13:47.198
But Moco-chan, we actually got something a little bit special that we can share with the Ruffians.

13:49.472 --> 13:51.575
Well, take a look at this!

13:54.498 --> 14:00.104
It's me, Fuwawa!

14:00.584 --> 14:05.470
You look so fluffy and ready to break the dimensions!

14:06.223 --> 14:11.868
Yeah, maybe you'll just have to wait a little bit longer to see exactly how fluffy!

14:12.469 --> 14:12.989
Yeah!

14:13.590 --> 14:14.651
And... Me!

14:14.731 --> 14:18.214
Moco-chan!

14:18.234 --> 14:19.094
Moco-chan!

14:19.114 --> 14:19.595
Yeah!

14:19.895 --> 14:21.196
Pretty fluffy tail there.

14:21.336 --> 14:22.217
Right!

14:22.397 --> 14:23.018
Yeah!

14:23.278 --> 14:24.179
Like a big puff.

14:24.699 --> 14:25.160
Right!

14:29.727 --> 14:31.749
I look forward to seeing it!

14:32.630 --> 14:33.310
Maybe soon.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.231
Maybe.

14:34.251 --> 14:40.116
You'll have to tune into the program to catch all the latest news on Breaking Dimensions!

14:40.197 --> 14:41.017
Yay!

14:41.438 --> 14:43.499
Maybe there'll be some surprises too.

14:43.519 --> 14:48.584
And then, after that, a 3D debut!

14:48.644 --> 14:51.667
BAU BAU BAU!

14:52.127 --> 14:53.548
But, what did you say?

14:54.029 --> 14:54.910
A fuzzy tail?

14:56.447 --> 14:57.349
I'm the fluffy one.

14:57.589 --> 14:58.751
Did you say fluffy, Taylor?

14:58.771 --> 14:59.712
No, I said fuzzy.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.598
Are you sure about that?

15:03.938 --> 15:04.960
I'm the fluffy one.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.002
She said fluffy.

15:11.332 --> 15:14.314
I'm the fluffy one, I'm Fuwawa!

15:14.855 --> 15:15.896
BAU BAU!

15:16.276 --> 15:17.157
BAU BAU BAU!

15:17.177 --> 15:19.738
Speaking of 3D debuts!

15:19.839 --> 15:20.499
Yes!

15:20.619 --> 15:28.505
Someone who's not fluffy, someone who's not fuzzy, will be making their 3D debut today!

15:28.625 --> 15:29.386
Yes!

15:29.766 --> 15:31.988
And that one is Nerissa!

15:32.028 --> 15:34.309
Nerissa, we be good!

15:34.369 --> 15:36.191
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

15:37.852 --> 15:44.014
Yeah, she's gonna be taking to the stage just after she released her brand new EP.

15:44.094 --> 15:44.774
Right.

15:44.814 --> 15:49.356
But she'll be making her debut at 8pm PT.

15:49.676 --> 15:50.917
So maybe Ruffians.

15:51.442 --> 15:56.844
Maybe you can get ready, get some coffee, maybe grab, gather some popcorn!

15:56.864 --> 15:57.064
Yeah!

15:57.084 --> 15:58.505
Or some meat!

15:58.725 --> 15:59.145
Meat!

15:59.205 --> 16:00.826
Nerissa always wants some meat!

16:00.866 --> 16:01.946
What do you want to eat, Nerissa?

16:01.986 --> 16:02.306
Meat?

16:02.927 --> 16:04.387
No carbonated soda?

16:04.467 --> 16:04.767
No.

16:04.847 --> 16:05.367
No.

16:06.068 --> 16:11.610
Once you have that all, you can get ready for Nerissa's beautiful boys!

16:11.630 --> 16:12.150
Yeah!

16:12.270 --> 16:13.791
Are you excited, Ruffians?

16:14.071 --> 16:14.191
Yeah!

16:14.211 --> 16:14.731
Yeah!

16:14.751 --> 16:16.012
Somehow!

16:16.112 --> 16:16.692
Bye bye!

16:20.333 --> 16:21.834
We're looking forward to it!

16:21.874 --> 16:23.654
I wonder what Nerissa's gonna do.

16:23.694 --> 16:27.155
We'll have to see very soon.

16:27.256 --> 16:28.096
Only 12 hours!

16:28.876 --> 16:31.157
You have a bit of time to make some popcorn.

16:32.017 --> 16:34.518
If you properly manage your time, you can do it.

16:34.538 --> 16:38.259
12 hours is quite a bit of time to make some popcorn.

16:38.899 --> 16:39.199
Maybe.

16:39.219 --> 16:40.380
BAU BAU!

16:40.480 --> 16:42.580
But, tomorrow...

16:44.957 --> 16:46.037
Tomorrow.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.118
Tomorrow, Ruffians!

16:48.258 --> 16:49.799
That's our big day!

16:50.239 --> 16:53.980
But then we make our 3D debut!

16:54.000 --> 16:54.060
Yes!

16:55.521 --> 16:56.321
Moco-chan.

16:56.981 --> 16:57.661
Which is bigger?

16:58.262 --> 16:59.762
Nervous or excited?

17:03.723 --> 17:03.984
Both.

17:05.984 --> 17:06.885
Both?

17:07.945 --> 17:09.706
Well, I'll be excited.

17:09.746 --> 17:10.686
You'll be nervous?

17:10.866 --> 17:11.166
Yes!

17:11.586 --> 17:11.946
Okay.

17:11.986 --> 17:12.366
Yes!

17:12.466 --> 17:12.847
Yeah.

17:13.147 --> 17:13.747
We are both.

17:14.497 --> 17:16.358
Ah, yeah!

17:17.319 --> 17:28.247
It's also, you know, not only is it a day that we're really excited and nervous, it's also the day that you find out really just how fluffy and fuzzy we are!

17:28.867 --> 17:33.350
You know, even practicing singing and dancing non-stop!

17:33.870 --> 17:38.254
You know, we worked so, so hard towards this one day!

17:39.920 --> 17:40.140
Yeah.

17:40.220 --> 17:43.782
Ruffians, we hope you know just how hard that we've worked.

17:44.122 --> 17:46.504
How many tears we've shed.

17:46.584 --> 17:48.805
How much we sweat.

17:49.225 --> 17:50.646
It's been a long journey.

17:50.666 --> 17:51.707
It has!

17:51.967 --> 17:52.327
Yeah.

17:52.747 --> 17:54.848
And tomorrow... It's gonna be great.

17:55.088 --> 18:00.231
Well, tomorrow will be the result of all our hard work.

18:00.251 --> 18:00.331
Yeah.

18:00.911 --> 18:04.073
Please, Ruffians, please look forward to the day!

18:04.453 --> 18:04.673
Yeah!

18:05.154 --> 18:05.914
Yeah.

18:06.094 --> 18:07.215
And, Ruffians,

18:08.274 --> 18:09.836
Countdown images!

18:10.357 --> 18:12.940
It says three days left, but it's no longer three days left.

18:12.980 --> 18:13.761
No, it's closer!

18:13.962 --> 18:17.486
Yeah, much closer.

18:17.987 --> 18:20.450
What did you think, Ruffians?

18:20.851 --> 18:21.452
What do you think?

18:21.472 --> 18:22.854
Looking a bit fluffy there.

18:26.758 --> 18:29.459
Yeah!

18:29.479 --> 18:30.640
Are you excited?

18:30.680 --> 18:30.980
Yeah!

18:31.340 --> 18:35.802
Well, I tweeted about how I'm going to put you into a fluffy hair look.

18:36.162 --> 18:36.342
Yeah!

18:36.663 --> 18:37.683
Figuratively.

18:37.703 --> 18:38.684
Figuratively.

18:39.024 --> 18:43.706
But it seems like a lot of Ruffians think I might actually... Ruffians?

18:44.806 --> 18:48.748
I'm an idol, you know!

18:49.448 --> 18:49.908
Yeah!

18:50.809 --> 18:53.130
And look, I know.

18:55.146 --> 18:57.188
Well, uh, Ruffians.

18:58.649 --> 19:07.736
Actually, the Great Okan apparently even thinks that there might be some extreme violence too!

19:07.756 --> 19:10.498
Yeah, he responded to us on Twitter!

19:10.778 --> 19:10.958
Yeah!

19:10.978 --> 19:12.819
We're so surprised!

19:13.360 --> 19:18.083
But, uh, the Great Okan is a really famous pro wrestler in Japan!

19:18.143 --> 19:18.524
Yeah!

19:18.604 --> 19:22.286
And also is a huge hololive fan too!

19:22.506 --> 19:22.747
Yeah!

19:22.827 --> 19:24.388
Yeah... But...

19:25.560 --> 19:26.881
Maybe he's confused.

19:27.241 --> 19:32.466
Yeah, I think he's confused too.

19:33.147 --> 19:36.069
We're idols, Ruffians!

19:36.089 --> 19:36.469
Yeah!

19:36.529 --> 19:37.470
Demon dogs!

19:37.550 --> 19:38.471
Got it!

19:38.751 --> 19:39.452
Got it!

19:39.652 --> 19:41.834
Have you seen me?

19:41.874 --> 19:41.914
Oh!

19:48.381 --> 19:48.622
Wow!

19:48.682 --> 19:49.162
Hi!

19:49.202 --> 19:50.323
Two days left!

19:50.343 --> 19:50.923
Two days!

19:50.963 --> 19:51.764
We're not at two days!

19:51.964 --> 19:54.225
I think a Ruffian is at 36 hours.

19:54.685 --> 19:56.306
Oh, that's like right in between.

19:56.326 --> 19:59.488
Just about.

19:59.769 --> 20:02.190
If you think about it, that's like one day left.

20:03.471 --> 20:04.612
One day plus 12 hours.

20:04.952 --> 20:05.372
Yeah.

20:05.592 --> 20:06.553
Is that 36 hours?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.414
I don't know.

20:07.894 --> 20:08.114
I think.

20:09.435 --> 20:11.476
And there's Moco-chan there!

20:11.516 --> 20:12.036
Yeah!

20:12.177 --> 20:12.917
It's me!

20:13.017 --> 20:14.238
Looking very fluffy!

20:14.258 --> 20:14.698
Fluffy?

20:15.098 --> 20:15.599
A fuzzy.

20:16.472 --> 20:18.873
What is wrong with you today, huh?

20:19.073 --> 20:21.133
It is opposite day!

20:21.333 --> 20:22.613
Opposite day!

20:22.633 --> 20:30.215
I'm sorry for offending you so horribly, Moco-chan.

20:30.235 --> 20:30.775
Thank you!

20:30.915 --> 20:34.296
Thank you for the apology, huh?

20:35.576 --> 20:36.776
Okay, you look fuzzy then!

20:36.856 --> 20:37.416
Got it?

20:37.496 --> 20:37.996
Thank you!

20:38.296 --> 20:38.816
Got it!

20:38.856 --> 20:40.097
That is correct!

20:40.177 --> 20:40.417
Okay.

20:42.965 --> 20:45.207
Yeah, please look forward to it, okay?

20:45.227 --> 20:46.287
BAU BAU!

20:46.368 --> 20:48.569
BAU BAU!

20:49.030 --> 20:50.611
But we're gonna put our all.

20:50.631 --> 20:54.894
Hopefully we don't make any mistakes.

20:56.515 --> 21:01.018
Make sure you wave your penlights lots and lots on BAU BAU for us too, okay?

21:01.038 --> 21:02.299
Okay, Ruffians!

21:02.319 --> 21:02.760
BAU BAU!

21:02.780 --> 21:03.020
36 hours.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.078
August 10th, 8pm PT.

21:11.118 --> 21:12.320
BAU BAU!

21:12.420 --> 21:14.784
Are you sure that's the time?

21:14.804 --> 21:14.864
Yes.

21:16.286 --> 21:16.527
No.

21:16.807 --> 21:17.047
Yes.

21:17.208 --> 21:17.528
Yes?

21:17.748 --> 21:17.969
Yes.

21:21.714 --> 21:21.955
Yes.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.905
BAU BAU!

21:24.925 --> 21:28.186
How many times have we been saying it, Moco-chan?

21:28.306 --> 21:30.587
We've said it so much I can't remember anymore.

21:31.387 --> 21:32.627
BAU BAU.

21:33.307 --> 21:34.808
BAU BAU!

21:34.948 --> 21:40.009
Wow, now that we remember the important things, let's take a look at the other important things.

21:40.109 --> 21:40.649
Yeah!

21:40.669 --> 21:43.270
Like today's Doggie of the Day!

21:43.370 --> 21:44.590
We have De-den!

21:44.910 --> 21:45.870
Hanzo!

21:46.271 --> 21:46.691
Hanzo!

21:46.791 --> 21:49.791
The Doggie of the Day!

21:49.811 --> 21:51.232
I can hear this noise.

21:53.236 --> 22:04.142
Hanzo's cute!

22:04.322 --> 22:06.304
Just like that!

22:06.584 --> 22:09.565
Look at all the rules of the fluffles!

22:10.346 --> 22:11.166
Yeah!

22:11.326 --> 22:15.969
Very, very cute!

22:16.309 --> 22:18.751
But Hanzo loves to nap.

22:19.491 --> 22:21.552
Moco-chan, what did we need earlier?

22:22.273 --> 22:22.593
A nap.

22:24.080 --> 22:24.820
What do we do?

22:24.840 --> 22:25.921
Practice.

22:26.101 --> 22:28.102
BAU BAU.

22:28.162 --> 22:29.142
BAU BAU!

22:29.903 --> 22:50.312
We're glad that Hanzo's getting lots of zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi zi

22:51.891 --> 23:08.779
I will personally make sure that Hanzo always has the freshest, most comfy smelling sheets in the world.

23:08.939 --> 23:10.120
Personal guarantee.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.221
Fuwawa guarantees it.

23:12.421 --> 23:16.443
But you know, maybe FUWAMOCO, maybe we can replace that plushie too.

23:18.949 --> 23:19.770
It does, of course.

23:19.890 --> 23:20.891
Oh, no, it's Pero.

23:21.451 --> 23:22.352
No!

23:22.552 --> 23:26.076
I-I-I-Hanzo looks very comfy there.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.877
I wanna be comfy, too.

23:27.897 --> 23:28.738
I wanna be nice.

23:28.918 --> 23:29.419
Yeah.

23:30.219 --> 23:32.662
BAU BAU!

23:32.682 --> 23:33.703
BAU BAU!

23:33.743 --> 23:35.824
Well, Ruffians, the movie continues!

23:36.165 --> 23:38.987
Let's take a look where your paws have been taking you!

23:39.067 --> 23:40.148
We have De-den!

23:44.890 --> 23:52.893
We're so happy that you were able to go for a nice walk after not being home for a little while.

23:53.173 --> 23:54.514
And with good company.

23:54.534 --> 24:00.396
We're really happy that you were able to rescue her out of the machine.

24:01.891 --> 24:05.416
Had Ayame-senpai to accompany you all the places you've been.

24:05.516 --> 24:07.660
You had some good luck there, huh?

24:07.860 --> 24:08.461
Yeah.

24:08.981 --> 24:09.683
Why?

24:09.823 --> 24:13.168
Thank you for sharing it with us!

24:13.488 --> 24:14.309
Mama!

24:16.893 --> 24:19.475
And next, Moco-chan, do we have a question?

24:19.696 --> 24:20.056
Yeah.

24:20.336 --> 24:20.576
Oh.

24:20.777 --> 24:25.261
For our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

24:25.641 --> 24:27.923
I was wondering what you would prefer.

24:28.404 --> 24:35.910
If we take many screenshots during our upcoming 3D showcase, or fully focus our attention on enjoying your performance?

24:35.971 --> 24:36.731
Good question.

24:38.881 --> 24:42.062
Well, I think this duet makes you the most happy.

24:42.122 --> 24:42.823
Yeah!

24:42.963 --> 24:51.366
You know, whether that's commenting a lot so that we can see you, or being in a call and BAU BAU-ing together with other Ruffians.

24:51.526 --> 24:51.766
Right!

24:51.806 --> 24:53.427
You know, like a WATCH party.

24:53.447 --> 24:54.467
A WATCH party.

24:54.547 --> 24:54.807
Yeah.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.468
Maybe live tweeting using our hashtag.

24:57.488 --> 24:58.369
That would be nice too.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.270
Don't use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

25:00.590 --> 25:01.050
No, no, no.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.411
Making memes.

25:03.831 --> 25:07.394
Or being the best photographer ever and sharing your pics.

25:07.814 --> 25:09.355
It's all up to you!

25:09.455 --> 25:11.376
Whatever is the most fun you know.

25:11.556 --> 25:16.059
And you can watch it live and then decide to do that afterwards too!

25:16.519 --> 25:18.361
It's up to you, Ruffians!

25:19.081 --> 25:20.382
Only one hashtag!

25:20.502 --> 25:21.422
Only one hashtag!

25:22.063 --> 25:24.084
The hashtag is... Hashtag!

25:24.885 --> 25:26.366
FWMC3D!

25:26.506 --> 25:27.026
Got it.

25:29.199 --> 25:29.840
Not that hard.

25:30.180 --> 25:30.540
Yeah.

25:31.081 --> 25:31.421
Yeah.

25:32.342 --> 25:36.926
I can't believe it's so soon.

25:36.966 --> 25:37.807
Ruffians!

25:37.827 --> 25:38.968
Do you know what you're gonna do?

25:38.988 --> 25:40.850
Do you have a plan, Ruffians?

25:40.930 --> 25:42.671
I usually tweet afterwards.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.073
That's a strategy too, you know?

25:46.014 --> 25:47.856
It would be cool if... What?

25:48.497 --> 25:48.957
Twins.

25:49.277 --> 25:50.999
That would be cool.

25:51.279 --> 25:51.699
Huh?

25:51.820 --> 25:52.640
FUWAMOCO.

25:53.161 --> 25:53.881
Trending.

25:53.901 --> 25:53.961
Huh?

25:54.963 --> 25:55.764
Trendy.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.584
Trendy.

25:56.745 --> 25:58.546
Trendy means you're up on the times.

25:59.227 --> 26:01.889
But you don't call Twitter, Twitter anymore.

26:03.610 --> 26:04.971
I'm gonna trend on Twitter!

26:05.151 --> 26:05.312
Yay!

26:05.672 --> 26:06.513
If the Ruffians help.

26:06.933 --> 26:07.654
Yay!

Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

26:14.079 --> 26:16.060
All your questions, please send us more questions.

26:16.080 --> 26:19.343
There's been some very good questions recently.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.265
Also, your Pero Sightings.

26:21.325 --> 26:21.765
Yay!

26:21.985 --> 26:23.707
I'm sure you can see them around.

26:24.836 --> 26:25.196
Soon.

26:25.356 --> 26:25.737
Maybe.

26:25.777 --> 26:26.097
Maybe.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.799
Just a little bit closer, okay?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.801
And your walks in summertime!

26:30.841 --> 26:31.802
Go out for a walk!

26:32.323 --> 26:36.546
And if you maybe see a very cute doggy, maybe that's the Doggie of the Day!

26:36.566 --> 26:39.469
Let us know with the hashtag!

26:39.509 --> 26:41.811

26:45.434 --> 26:51.079
Well, Nerissa's 3D debut is coming up very soon, but before that... Wait!

26:51.239 --> 26:51.880
We have...

26:52.852 --> 26:53.252
De-den!

26:53.553 --> 26:56.936
We're playing the newest hololive game from hololive Indie!

26:56.956 --> 26:58.237
Treasure Mountain.

26:58.357 --> 26:59.338
It looks pretty fun.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.701
It looks really fun, very colorful, very cute!

27:03.081 --> 27:07.105
It looks kinda like a little bit reminiscent of Suica game.

27:07.506 --> 27:08.046
But not.

27:08.126 --> 27:08.486
It's not.

27:09.530 --> 27:09.970
Advent.

27:09.990 --> 27:10.751
Making a mountain.

27:11.251 --> 27:11.711
Treasure.

27:12.051 --> 27:13.112
Oh, with our senpai.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.353
Cause they are the treasure!

27:14.393 --> 27:16.174
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:17.074 --> 27:22.117
Oh, we're gonna give it a shot and... But we'll see how much fun it really, really is.

27:22.177 --> 27:24.318
My angel senpai is very loud in it.

27:25.319 --> 27:26.079
Well, we'll see.

27:26.139 --> 27:29.201
So we're gonna be even louder maybe.

27:29.361 --> 27:33.263
And then, right after that, it's Nerissa's CD debut!

27:33.303 --> 27:34.403
Yeah!

27:34.464 --> 27:35.144

27:36.405 --> 27:37.347

27:37.367 --> 27:40.712
Don't forget the time, okay?

27:40.772 --> 27:42.354
She has her own hashtag too.

27:42.935 --> 27:47.221
Can we take a peek at our schedule, Moco-chan?

27:47.782 --> 27:49.805
Just in case you forgot, there's a theory!

27:50.566 --> 27:51.787
Happy debut!

27:52.107 --> 28:00.751
And after that, well, on Sunday at 6pm PT, we're gonna be having an after-party for our debut!

28:00.791 --> 28:06.474
We'll talk about lots of different stuff this night, and our thoughts on stuff all day.

28:06.514 --> 28:09.795
You know, what kind of feelings we put into things, you know.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.336
You definitely wanna hear all the stories.

28:12.777 --> 28:13.897
