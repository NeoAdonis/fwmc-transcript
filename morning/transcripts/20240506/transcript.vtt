00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.504
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:18.666
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:22.268
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:24.168
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.550
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.511
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:32.632
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.672 --> 00:05:33.993
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:34.993 --> 00:05:40.856
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.057
Ruffians!

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:44.858
It's a new week and a new episode!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.619
Our 94th episode!

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.139
BAU BAU!

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.901
Thank you so much for joining us today!

00:05:53.362 --> 00:05:59.304
And for some Ruffians that might be new... How did you get here?

00:05:59.324 --> 00:05:59.644
Right.

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:01.445
I don't know.

00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:03.026
Probably by rolling out of bed.

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:13.559
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:14.439
A.K.A.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.440
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.441
It's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:26.390
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.056
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:32.177 --> 00:06:36.001
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.722
BAU BAU!

00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:49.287
Mococo sounding better, right?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.288
But you're gonna rest a lot more, right?

00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:54.729
Cause this week is a fluffy week.

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:55.789
Fluffy week!

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:56.749
Fluffy week!

00:07:04.028 --> 00:07:06.350
Pero Sighting deshita.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:22.000
You know Pero was really busy last week doing translations and RSJSJP subbed by, but... I guess not.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.163
I guess Ruffians... Pero, you didn't see him?

00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:39.124
I guess you must be tired after all the events going on.

00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:43.168
He did help us and you know the Ruffians out with all the translations.

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:46.352
Doing our streams together with our JP-senpai.

00:07:46.392 --> 00:07:50.637
So you know both his brains and his wings.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.823
It must be tired from all the speed typing.

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:56.804
Right, right.

00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:57.825
Pero's gone missing.

00:07:58.285 --> 00:07:59.967
I don't know if it's missing.

00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:06.615
Or maybe, you know, he's just kind of all holed up in whatever he wants to hold up in.

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:07.396
Doing his thing!

00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:12.101
Yeah, he's just sleeping and maybe taking some time for himself.

00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:13.142
Vacation.

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:15.139
BAU BAU!

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:16.300
Keep your eyes open, okay?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.141
Don't get close.

00:08:39.656 --> 00:08:40.077
BAU BAU!

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:52.696
Ruffians!

00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:58.223
Maybe one thing that comes to mind first is... FUWAMOCO!

00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:01.227
We started our Minecraft journey!

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:03.629
BAU BAU!

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.315
We started from having our very little knowledge of Minecraft.

00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:11.619
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:12.039
BAU BAU!

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:13.861
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:13.901 --> 00:09:14.281
BAU BAU!

00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:15.743
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:16.083
BAU BAU!

00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:31.916
Today I'm losing them all because of Fuwawa!

00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:34.377
And then you're having a legend?

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:36.118
Cobblestone house now!

00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:37.198
Yeah, we did!

00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:39.099
Slowly but surely learning!

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:39.519
Yeah!

00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:40.040
I know!

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.241
Fuwawa didn't even know that we had the iron tools.

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.543
I thought they were just like a... Not iron, just like a rock.

00:09:47.763 --> 00:09:48.543
They're not rocks?

00:09:49.043 --> 00:09:50.984
I worked hard for them and then you lost them.

00:09:51.364 --> 00:09:52.625
How did you make the iron?

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:55.126
I got iron and then you...

00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:58.279
I wanna get ironed.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:13.107
Yeah, there's been some bumps along the way, but Ruffians, I think, you know, we're in good paws because we have you there together with us.

00:10:13.187 --> 00:10:19.371
It's definitely a different experience, you know, having us play and stream separately on different computers.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.691
What did you think, Ruffians?

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:21.432
Yeah.

00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:25.926
It's a bit different, huh?

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:29.789
Did you like hearing our voices this early in the background?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.651
It was fun, it was cool!

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:33.512
You were confused!

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:35.133
It was a good experience!

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.334
A bit laggy?

00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:38.456
That's YouTube's fault, maybe.

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:42.919
Yeah, we'll be better split-screen.

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:45.901
We looked into the office!

00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:52.106
It's not as easy as you think and that it might be hard to see everything.

00:10:52.146 --> 00:10:54.028
There's a lot going on in my head.

00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:57.669
Because we were thinking that would be fun too, right?

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.091
But it's not possible.

00:10:59.191 --> 00:10:59.591
Yeah.

00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:01.533
We did really try.

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:02.554
Really, really?

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:03.996
Yeah.

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.437
But you know what?

00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:08.841
I made a couple funny sounds during Minecraft too.

00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:10.462
Yeah, I did too, right?

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:12.485
Right?

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:14.447
Wait, which one?

00:11:15.468 --> 00:11:15.588
Um...

00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:20.654
That one.

00:11:20.674 --> 00:11:26.821
The squeaky toy sound at the end.

00:11:27.462 --> 00:11:28.023
I don't know.

00:11:29.184 --> 00:11:30.025
It just happens.

00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:35.571
I don't mean that seagull sound that you make too, Moco-chan.

00:11:36.452 --> 00:11:38.274
I don't know, it's way too high!

00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:41.136
Yeah, but we had a lot of fun.

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:46.500
We're looking forward to improving and learning how to play Minecraft more.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.084
Yeah, it's probably going to take us a while to learn, but we're up to the challenge!

00:11:52.664 --> 00:11:54.926
Please look forward to more, okay?

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.968
After FUWAMO week, okay Ruffians?

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.289
Not this week, but hopefully next week.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.090
BAU BAU!

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.092
BAU BAU!

00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:08.257
You know Golden Week, we did a bunch of things.

00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:15.083
We had our first collab with Watame-senpai!

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:15.964
BAU BAU!

00:12:15.984 --> 00:12:19.687
We are so so super happy to be able to play together.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:21.588
We played Co-op House games all together.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.034
We really wanted to show everybody, you know, we're FUWAMOCO!

00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:29.275
We're fluffy and fuzzy!

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:31.337
We're the top fluff!

00:12:31.397 --> 00:12:32.838
We're demon dogs!

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.380
Watame-senpai, she's just a sheep.

00:12:36.141 --> 00:12:40.105
But... We got pulverized instead.

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:43.207
The squeal is...

00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:45.219
We're seventeen.

00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:49.364
It's the winner being Watame-senpai!

00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:54.790
She's a strong sheep, okay?

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.876
Because, you know, we lost and we lost really badly.

00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:03.720
There was a bit of a punishment, right, Moco-chan?

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:06.864
Chu-chu time.

00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:09.589
Yeah, chu-chu time.

00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:18.644
So, yeah, the collab might have ended with some chu-chu-chus over in Watame-senpai's direction.

00:13:19.084 --> 00:13:19.285
Yeah.

00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:23.600
But it was a bunch of fun, right?

00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:25.562
Yeah!

00:13:25.822 --> 00:13:27.303
Who knew that was amazing?

00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:31.746
We're playing so amazing at darts and boxing and so many games.

00:13:31.766 --> 00:13:32.547
Right.

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.048
We didn't start the chat.

00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:35.569
What was that steak one?

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:36.290
Yeah.

00:13:37.611 --> 00:13:41.954
But we really hope that we can play more games together with her soon.

00:13:42.814 --> 00:13:43.535
And also!

00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:49.979
Watame-senpai also just released her own version of the hololive Ierukana 2024 version.

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:52.301
Do you remember it, Ruffians?

00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:55.323
It was released during Expo earlier in March.

00:13:55.383 --> 00:13:59.866
But you can check out Watame-senpai's version over on her channel.

00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:06.510
And you'll definitely want to go take a look because Watame-senpai cosplays with every hololive member

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.832
Including Fuwamoco!

00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:10.313
It's really cute!

00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:14.216
And you know, there's some super cute details in the art too.

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:19.500
Like you know, Fauna-senpai's pattern on her skirt is now changed to do-do-do.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.522
And lots of stuff like that, so see if you can catch them all, okay?

00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:25.644
I've seen them all too, right?

00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:26.285
BAU BAU!

00:14:30.783 --> 00:14:31.443
Catch them all!

00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:32.904
Save them all!

00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:35.044
It's hololive ieru kana?

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:37.045
Not the other ieru kana?

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:37.105
No.

00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:39.906
Kinda sounds like it, especially when you catch them all.

00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:41.686
No, not like that.

00:14:42.446 --> 00:14:44.387
BAU BAU!

00:14:47.548 --> 00:14:48.748
Wow.

00:14:50.148 --> 00:14:50.989
Moco-chan.

00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:52.649
Ruffians.

00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:55.730
I know I was busy with Golden Week.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:56.850
What?

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.251
Did you notice?

00:14:59.571 --> 00:14:59.731
Huh?

00:15:00.543 --> 00:15:00.923
Hi!

00:15:02.884 --> 00:15:09.607
Well... All of a sudden... After Shiori's birthday!

00:15:10.607 --> 00:15:11.168
Yeah!

00:15:11.548 --> 00:15:14.529
Nerissa showed up!

00:15:14.589 --> 00:15:16.750
BAU BAU!

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.072
They had a sleepover party together!

00:15:20.812 --> 00:15:27.295
I don't know what's going on, but maybe... Is this a birthday present to Shiori from Nerissa?

00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:31.000
The rain's blue.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.682
They should've talked about a bunch of funny stuff, huh?

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:35.722
Funny stuff.

00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:36.863
Yeah.

00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:45.706
I know I should've played one, but I... You know, I... I hope they had a lot of fun.

00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:47.367
But that was us.

00:15:47.387 --> 00:15:48.247
That was us.

00:15:48.828 --> 00:15:49.128
Huh?

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.142
Not jealous at all.

00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:53.782
Yeah.

00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:54.803
No.

00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:55.863
Yeah.

00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.165
Absolutely not.

00:15:59.966 --> 00:16:00.326
No.

00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:01.127
Yeah.

00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:03.448
Maybe soon.

00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:05.149
One day.

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.690
One day.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.430
One day.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:12.933
I will be looking forward to what happens in the future.

00:16:13.334 --> 00:16:13.454
Yeah.

00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:17.276
We're just gonna have to put those jealous feelings aside.

00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:18.396
Jealous feelings!

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:18.557
Sad.

00:16:22.108 --> 00:16:25.250
BAU BAU!

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:28.033
You had time with Nerissa already?

00:16:28.413 --> 00:16:29.174
Not enough!

00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:32.517
Have you ever spent time with Nerissa?

00:16:32.637 --> 00:16:33.578
It's never enough.

00:16:33.658 --> 00:16:37.362
I guess you could say that about Moco-chan too.

00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:42.646
Really?

00:16:42.946 --> 00:16:48.447
Yeah, because we spend a lot of time together and I still haven't gotten annoyed of you.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:49.747
You sure?

00:16:49.907 --> 00:16:51.408
Okay, now I am.

00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:53.168
BAU BAU!

00:16:53.228 --> 00:16:54.328
BAU BAU!

00:16:54.568 --> 00:17:04.270
While Golden Week it was filled with a bunch of firsts, first collabs, but... On top of that, we ate a new food!

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.870
Yeah, a new food.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.651
One that's maybe a bit surprising.

00:17:10.202 --> 00:17:11.903
Do you have any ideas, Ruffians?

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.306
Mayonnaise pon-de-ring?

00:17:17.406 --> 00:17:19.948
I don't know what that classifies as a food.

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:25.211
I've had onions before and I know what I like and don't like.

00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.751
And that's not onions.

00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:28.593
Okonomiyaki, we had that.

00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:30.013
Okona, I like okona.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:30.914
Saba miso!

00:17:30.974 --> 00:17:32.815
I haven't had that before.

00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:36.436
Jingisukanaiya.

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:41.379
Oh, Pufferface, Fugu, Fuwamoco, we're not that kind of demon dog.

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.419
But!

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:47.161
You know we met with Koyori-senpai from our off-collab, right?

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:56.693
She gave us a bunch of cup noodles to try out!

00:17:57.534 --> 00:18:00.195
BAU BAU for me!

00:18:00.235 --> 00:18:05.358
You know, actually, FUWAMOCO, we've never ever eaten cup noodles before.

00:18:05.798 --> 00:18:09.520
So we were really curious and really happy to try them!

00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:11.783
You know what?

00:18:12.483 --> 00:18:19.990
Despite being in a cup, like a styrofoam cup, they were really, really, really good!

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.514
You know, Mama Puppy, she always said that no Fuwamoco, you can't eat them.

00:18:25.995 --> 00:18:28.657
So that's why we didn't really have any.

00:18:28.697 --> 00:18:33.701
But these, you know, they have meat and seafood and veggies in them.

00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:36.443
So they should be good, right?

00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:37.584
They were good!

00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:40.286
It was a bit mysterious, though.

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:41.547
The meat, right?

00:18:41.607 --> 00:18:42.807
What kind of meat are you?

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.668
It doesn't matter.

00:18:44.788 --> 00:18:48.170
I could see bits of octopus in it, though, and seafood, right?

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.672
Yeah, it was really, really yummy!

00:18:51.992 --> 00:18:55.454
But, you know, Koyori-senpai, she had a favorite one.

00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:57.955
So we decided to save that one for last.

00:18:58.335 --> 00:19:00.656
And that was the milk seafood.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.951
I really liked that one.

00:19:06.372 --> 00:19:10.016
I liked it so much that I even drank the soup from the bottom of it.

00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:11.398
I don't know if you're supposed to do that.

00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:12.499
I don't know either!

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:14.541
I felt a little bit guilty doing it.

00:19:18.363 --> 00:19:23.428
But they really, really helped us out so much during a busy Golden Week.

00:19:23.468 --> 00:19:28.092
So we're really, really grateful to Koyori-senpai for all the helpful notes.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.537
It was nice to have something warm for my barker, too.

00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:34.919
We had so many flavors, right?

00:19:35.139 --> 00:19:37.321
What do you think was the best one, Moco-chan?

00:19:38.062 --> 00:19:39.123
Your favorite flavor.

00:19:40.197 --> 00:19:44.879
They were all really good, but I think I liked the curry flavor one the best.

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:47.260
It was comfy!

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.642
And it wasn't in the curry flavor, but I also liked the little yellow bits.

00:19:53.062 --> 00:19:54.283
The egg, maybe?

00:19:54.763 --> 00:19:55.923
In some of them, yeah.

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:59.405
It sort of reminded me of eating little chickies.

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:00.905
Hiyoko-chan.

00:20:01.846 --> 00:20:05.127
Like they have little faces on them, because they're really fluffy.

00:20:08.237 --> 00:20:11.862
Yeah, I think curry was my favorite flavor too.

00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:14.165
Didn't you like the milk tea flavor?

00:20:14.185 --> 00:20:17.249
I liked the milk tea food, but the curry was really good too.

00:20:17.329 --> 00:20:18.491
It was really comfy.

00:20:19.472 --> 00:20:20.534
They're both really good.

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:23.956
Thank you Koyori-senpai!

00:20:24.017 --> 00:20:29.361
We are able to survive Golden Week because of Koyori-senpai's noodles.

00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:32.903
BAU BAU!

00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:34.385
Why not try eating curry next?

00:20:34.785 --> 00:20:36.626
We have been having curry.

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:39.168
Like just normal curry, not without the noodles.

00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:40.750
We have!

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.971
It's yummy!

00:20:42.731 --> 00:20:43.312
BAU BAU!

00:21:00.069 --> 00:21:00.329
BAU BAU!

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:24.530
Well, Ruffians, there's been some news.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.070
In case you haven't heard it, though.

00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:33.132
Us, FUWAMOCO, we have an unofficial rival.

00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:33.672
Yeah.

00:21:34.372 --> 00:21:34.752
Yeah.

00:21:35.693 --> 00:21:41.374
And, you know, his name, sometimes, it's hard to remember.

00:21:41.394 --> 00:21:41.474
What?

00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:44.775
It's always such a poor memory.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:47.376
It's Kevin Lamar.

00:21:47.396 --> 00:21:47.496
Yeah.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.361
Apparently, he released a new song or something recently.

00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:53.841
Something?

00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:54.441
Yeah.

00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:58.442
A few days ago we took a listen.

00:21:58.922 --> 00:21:59.582
You know what?

00:22:00.442 --> 00:22:05.303
We couldn't help but notice, but... He says BAU BAU BAU!

00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:07.104
What the heck?

00:22:07.144 --> 00:22:08.264
BAU BAU RUN!

00:22:08.344 --> 00:22:10.204
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:13.725
BAU BAU BAU!

00:22:14.905 --> 00:22:15.866
No way!

00:22:16.206 --> 00:22:16.726
Right!

00:22:17.964 --> 00:22:18.444
Challenge!

00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.285
Challenge!

00:22:19.585 --> 00:22:20.045
Yeah.

00:22:20.325 --> 00:22:21.066
I don't know.

00:22:21.826 --> 00:22:23.167
The eyes of FUWAMOCO.

00:22:23.227 --> 00:22:25.508
That's what it sounds like.

00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:27.449
He's a bit scared.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.050
Yeah.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:29.290
He's shaking, huh?

00:22:29.511 --> 00:22:30.251
He's sleepy.

00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:30.911
Yeah.

00:22:31.512 --> 00:22:31.932
No.

00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:33.773
When you've been going dogs?

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:35.514
BAU BAU BAU!

00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.915
We've been around for 2,000 years now!

00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:39.316
We're no puppies anymore!

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:39.736
No!

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:40.397
We're fine!

00:22:40.437 --> 00:22:41.137
We're all puppies!

00:22:41.157 --> 00:22:41.657
Yeah!

00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:42.278
Yeah!

00:22:43.018 --> 00:22:43.398
Morning!

00:22:43.438 --> 00:22:43.758
Morning!

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:46.414
BAU BAU!

00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:48.718
BAU BAU!

00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:51.302
BAU BAU, he's terrified, right?

00:22:51.362 --> 00:22:52.404
He should be!

00:22:52.825 --> 00:22:53.826
BAU BAU!

00:22:54.668 --> 00:22:55.729
BAU BAU!

00:22:56.371 --> 00:23:03.783
It's an interesting place to start the week, but more good times!

00:23:04.224 --> 00:23:06.067
You know, it's Monday.

00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:10.895
And that means, Ruffians, it's really important to challenge yourself to something new.

00:23:12.814 --> 00:23:20.898
And so, just like Moco-chan's been doing regularly, she's gonna challenge herself to something new, which would be natto.

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:27.682
But, FUWAMOCO's been busy and hasn't really been able to go to the store, and I ate all the natto!

00:23:28.202 --> 00:23:33.345
So, today, Moco-chan, you're gonna be challenging yourself

00:23:34.225 --> 00:23:36.606
Umeboshi!

00:23:36.786 --> 00:23:40.267
Umeboshi is kind of similar to natto.

00:23:40.527 --> 00:23:43.168
You can have them for breakfast, and they're pickled flowers.

00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:46.149
They're not fermented, they're pickled, which is kind of the same.

00:23:46.209 --> 00:23:49.210
And they're really healthy for you.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.631
And they're a very traditional Japanese food.

00:23:55.543 --> 00:23:56.444
I'm the delicious one.

00:23:56.464 --> 00:23:57.925
There is a normal one.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:03.990
But, they are also very, very super, super, supai.

00:24:05.371 --> 00:24:05.731
Sour.

00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:06.612
Sour!

00:24:06.672 --> 00:24:11.255
Yeah, you couldn't find the word.

00:24:11.335 --> 00:24:13.117
I couldn't find the word.

00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:17.380
Yeah, and this time they don't, no, no, no umeshu.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.322
No alcohol related.

00:24:20.382 --> 00:24:21.903
Can you open the container?

00:24:22.124 --> 00:24:22.744
I'll try it too.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.660
Hey!

00:24:30.221 --> 00:24:30.861
What was that?

00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:32.941
Hi!

00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.122
The container sounds so weird!

00:24:36.142 --> 00:24:39.022
It's pretty good!

00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:40.703
They're real!

00:24:41.103 --> 00:24:47.724
It just made a weird sound.

00:24:47.784 --> 00:24:48.064
Hi!

00:24:48.164 --> 00:24:50.005
I got the best ones I could get.

00:24:50.025 --> 00:24:52.265
These ones!

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:54.986
The farmers who worked hard to make these ones.

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:55.626
Look at them.

00:24:56.584 --> 00:24:58.446
They're in Wakayama-ken.

00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:00.087
Wakayama Perfection.

00:25:00.107 --> 00:25:01.228
Not United States.

00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:03.490
Not the United States.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.851
Not Tochigi.

00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:06.593
Wakayama-ken.

00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:07.694
Yeah.

00:25:08.034 --> 00:25:09.676
And they're really really red.

00:25:09.956 --> 00:25:11.177
And wrinkly.

00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:13.059
And they smell so good.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:13.779
They smell good.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.201
What does it say on the packaging?

00:25:16.762 --> 00:25:17.923
They have shiso.

00:25:18.123 --> 00:25:19.004
Shiso.

00:25:19.344 --> 00:25:20.885
Shiso leaves in them.

00:25:21.766 --> 00:25:22.307
On top.

00:25:22.547 --> 00:25:23.288
They have a very...

00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:26.013
Beautiful smell.

00:25:27.253 --> 00:25:30.434
That's what makes these umeboshi good.

00:25:30.454 --> 00:25:36.276
So Moco-chan, you're going to challenge yourself to eat an umeboshi.

00:25:36.296 --> 00:25:41.878
And then I'm going to challenge myself to eat a chibikasame.

00:25:42.038 --> 00:25:43.138
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:47.400
First, we'd like to say thank you to the farmers in Wakayama Prefecture.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.340
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:57.689
It's really soft.

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:01.510
Sometimes it's crunchy umeboshi too, right?

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.590
Like snack ones.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.010
Moco-chan, careful, there's a seed inside.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.931
Don't choke on the seed, okay?

00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:10.971
Moco-chan.

00:26:12.692 --> 00:26:17.913
Moco-chan.

00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:22.881
It's not that sour.

00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:23.622
What?

00:26:26.764 --> 00:26:28.486
It could be more sour.

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:34.050
But umeboshi is so yummy.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.472
I really want to try making them myself.

00:26:37.233 --> 00:26:38.414
How does it taste?

00:26:39.715 --> 00:26:40.435
Moco-chan.

00:26:42.196 --> 00:26:42.837
Yummy.

00:26:43.057 --> 00:26:44.418
Yummy?

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.419
Sour?

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:46.460
Not really.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.882
Is it like a plum flavor to it?

00:26:49.142 --> 00:26:49.442
No.

00:26:49.722 --> 00:26:50.023
Like a...

00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:53.808
What would you have it with?

00:26:54.209 --> 00:26:55.031
With rice?

00:26:59.443 --> 00:26:59.803
Sure?

00:27:00.383 --> 00:27:02.124
Sure, that's a usable way.

00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:03.704
I think you could put it on toast.

00:27:04.345 --> 00:27:06.645
Toast?

00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:07.966
Like a jam?

00:27:07.986 --> 00:27:09.286
Oh, like a jam?

00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:10.626
Crunch the seed!

00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:12.367
No way!

00:27:12.387 --> 00:27:16.588
If there's a crunch sound, that would be Moco-chan losing her teeth.

00:27:17.368 --> 00:27:20.689
Demon dog teeth are strong, but not that strong!

00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:21.450
No way!

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.510
Ah...

00:27:28.996 --> 00:27:29.096
Yum.

00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:33.438
I'm gonna have one too.

00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.039
They're really really big.

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.140
It's really wrinkly.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.423
But not that sour.

00:27:46.444 --> 00:27:47.504
It's yummy!

00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:50.826
It's good.

00:27:52.126 --> 00:27:53.167
I feel like they're very big though.

00:27:57.381 --> 00:27:58.562
You finished it already?

00:27:58.582 --> 00:28:01.604
Did you eat another?

00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:03.064
Really?

00:28:03.084 --> 00:28:07.467
That's it.

00:28:07.627 --> 00:28:09.087
BAU BAU!

00:28:09.928 --> 00:28:13.330
Ruffians, make sure you try umeboshi too, okay?

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.530
Yummy!

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.552
Maybe you can let us know how sour it was to you.

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:18.672
It's not that sour.

00:28:18.973 --> 00:28:19.473
It's good.

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.694
But, I feel like...

00:28:22.648 --> 00:28:24.830
I really go by sour food.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.332
Except for the soup that I made you, huh?

00:28:28.513 --> 00:28:30.335
I don't want to eat sour soup, you know?

00:28:31.456 --> 00:28:33.077
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.457 --> 00:28:38.081
Make sure to challenge yourself to extra challenges after something difficult, Ruffians!

00:28:38.922 --> 00:28:39.322
BAU BAU!

00:28:43.547 --> 00:28:47.268
FUWAMOCO-chan has had two irregular corners.

00:28:47.328 --> 00:28:47.928
Yes!

00:28:48.248 --> 00:28:50.188
She is our Doggie of the Day.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:53.629
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:28:53.689 --> 00:28:54.749
Rion!

00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:57.589
Rion!

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.330
Why?

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.670
Are you surprised because you're on FUWAMOCO Morning right now, Rion?

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.671
I can't believe I'm on FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:05.691 --> 00:29:07.911
Is that why your face is like this, Koi?

00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.092
Yeah, but I can understand though.

00:29:11.212 --> 00:29:12.012
I'd be surprised if...

00:29:12.572 --> 00:29:17.375
If, you know, I was on FUWAMOCO, I'd be surprised just like him.

00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:19.616
So cute, right?

00:29:19.636 --> 00:29:22.517
So cute!

00:29:23.398 --> 00:29:23.978
Leon!

00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:27.640
Leon's a good boy filled with energy!

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.161
I can see the energy.

00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:29.921
Energy!

00:29:29.982 --> 00:29:35.845
Even though he makes crazy faces like this, he's actually pretty quiet and doesn't bark all that much.

00:29:35.945 --> 00:29:37.686
Good boy.

00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:39.687
He's just having fun when he has fun.

00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:39.987
Yep.

00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:46.712
How does Leon BAU BAU?

00:29:48.513 --> 00:29:52.316
Maybe like BAU BAU!

00:29:52.937 --> 00:29:53.917
BAU BAU!

00:29:54.218 --> 00:29:56.159
BAU BAU!

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.800
I think just like that.

00:29:57.861 --> 00:30:00.903
Especially I can hear that now when I look at the picture of Leon.

00:30:02.644 --> 00:30:05.465
That's how it is.

00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:09.485
Leon's very cute and very fluffy.

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:16.787
And also Leon gets just as surprised as Fuwamoco gets when we're playing horror games.

00:30:16.907 --> 00:30:19.047
It makes sense.

00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:24.549
Hopefully he's a little bit more brave than us and doesn't run away with his tail between his legs.

00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:26.769
Why are you saying it like that's what we do?

00:30:28.189 --> 00:30:29.490
BAU BAU!

00:30:33.864 --> 00:30:34.805
Who is this?

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:35.765
Who is?

00:30:36.205 --> 00:30:36.605
Hi!

00:30:36.705 --> 00:30:38.005
No, that's Leon!

00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:38.646
Hi!

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:40.626
BAU BAU!

00:30:40.686 --> 00:30:42.107
BAU BAU!

00:30:42.127 --> 00:30:42.167
Hi!

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:46.328
Ruffians, you've been making sure to stretch out those paws, right?

00:30:46.848 --> 00:30:49.468
Let's see where you went on a walk this time for us.

00:30:49.709 --> 00:30:51.749
Today, I went on a walk!

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:52.609
Yay!

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:56.290
Where did we go?

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.991
De-den!

00:30:59.551 --> 00:31:00.852
Dangerous walk.

00:31:01.072 --> 00:31:02.092
What for?

00:31:04.867 --> 00:31:08.270
We're still getting better around them.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.552
Mainly thanks to Nerissa.

00:31:11.052 --> 00:31:15.916
But these ones here, they're particularly dangerous.

00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:20.559
Just because it looks like a slipper doesn't mean you should try it on, okay?

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:22.381
You might lose your whole foot.

00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:24.906
Not just a few toes.

00:31:25.607 --> 00:31:27.147
The whole foot gone.

00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:31.589
Just, you know, ignore it and continue on your day, okay?

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:34.831
No matter how curious you are, okay?

00:31:34.891 --> 00:31:38.312
Even if you think it might be soft inside and squishy, it's not a good slipper.

00:31:38.332 --> 00:31:38.372
No.

00:31:38.712 --> 00:31:38.932
No.

00:31:39.232 --> 00:31:39.432
No.

00:31:39.753 --> 00:31:40.733
Just us, okay?

00:31:41.653 --> 00:31:42.074
Yeah.

00:31:42.394 --> 00:31:43.034
We haven't tried.

00:31:44.844 --> 00:31:46.746
We hope you had a good one.

00:31:46.806 --> 00:31:47.988
Good walk and a good walk.

00:31:48.028 --> 00:31:50.631
Hopefully you're feeling better too.

00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:51.011
BAU BAU!

00:31:59.224 --> 00:32:01.525
Now for our Question of the Day!

00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:05.007
We have de-den!

00:32:05.687 --> 00:32:05.807
Oh!

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:11.890
Pass along my thanks to Pero, whose full-length name surprised me by being spelled Perroccino.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.351
For the live translation!

00:32:14.731 --> 00:32:16.692
Has known Japanese all this time.

00:32:16.992 --> 00:32:18.813
Did he perhaps mentor you in it?

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:20.033
Though he's just a pet.

00:32:20.393 --> 00:32:23.295
Will you do more live translations in the future?

00:32:25.305 --> 00:32:26.205
Wow.

00:32:26.685 --> 00:32:31.666
You see, Pero's incredibly fast at typing and translating because of his wings.

00:32:32.546 --> 00:32:40.028
But, you know, when it comes to spelling his name... We all have things that we're not great at, right?

00:32:40.128 --> 00:32:41.328
Yeah, right.

00:32:41.488 --> 00:32:43.568
It can be spelling problems.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.609
That's okay.

00:32:44.989 --> 00:32:48.389
But Pero hasn't known Japanese all the time, actually.

00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:51.930
He actually picked it up when...

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:57.828
I lost him in a Japanese textbook while we were doing guide dog training in Japan.

00:32:57.928 --> 00:32:59.348
Definitely not on purpose.

00:32:59.868 --> 00:33:00.889
Right!

00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:02.349
Not on purpose!

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:05.990
Yeah, it wasn't because, you know, we got tired of his yapping and... No!

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:16.212
Well... Yeah... And, uh... Then, you know, after that, I guess him being an old demon dog and everything...

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:21.534
That was the way, the best way, for him to be able to pick it up.

00:33:24.658 --> 00:33:29.144
You know, it was really interesting seeing all the kanji and hiragana all over him too.

00:33:29.164 --> 00:33:31.106
Yeah, he literally picked it all up.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:39.273
As for in the future though, it would be really helpful for all of us.

00:33:39.633 --> 00:33:42.914
Especially Ruffians who are still just learning Japanese.

00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:47.497
So we really hope that Pero will be there more for live translations.

00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:50.518
But I think that's up to Pero and Fuwawa.

00:33:50.678 --> 00:33:53.081
The kind of mood he's in, right?

00:33:53.341 --> 00:33:56.165
Whether he thinks the Ruffians deserve it or not.

00:33:56.425 --> 00:34:01.010
Probably if he's missing or not.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.194
We'll make sure to ask lots of questions!

00:34:04.294 --> 00:34:04.795
BAU BAU!

00:34:06.957 --> 00:34:10.242
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:16.031
We're always looking, so just use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:21.360
Send us your Pero Sighting, your questions, your works, your doggies, okay?

00:34:22.421 --> 00:34:23.682
I say this every time.

00:34:23.702 --> 00:34:25.302
Okay, Ruffians?

00:34:25.642 --> 00:34:26.723
I say it every time.

00:34:26.743 --> 00:34:28.304
We're waiting!

00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:29.324
BAU BAU!

00:34:29.384 --> 00:34:31.445
BAU BAU!

00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.286
As for our next stream, let's take a look at the schedule.

00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:36.567
Our schedule!

00:34:36.727 --> 00:34:39.928
We have dogs organized neatly.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.589
I'm gonna be organizing some dogs.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.870
Minus Moco-chan.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.011
All on my own.

00:34:46.471 --> 00:34:49.493
And I think I won't just be organizing them neatly.

00:34:49.933 --> 00:34:54.355
I'm hoping to organize them vertically as well.

00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.276
So, I'm gonna try a bunch of things.

00:34:56.736 --> 00:35:00.478
It's a little fresh fluffy flow.

00:35:00.558 --> 00:35:07.142
So, hopefully you can join me because I'm good at organizing, but I have never organized dogs.

00:35:07.162 --> 00:35:07.602
So, we'll see.

00:35:09.963 --> 00:35:10.583
BAU BAU.

00:35:10.763 --> 00:35:17.567
And after that, well, we have Moco-chan will be here beside me for FUWAMOCO Morning this week.

00:35:17.827 --> 00:35:19.748
But you're gonna be doing a lot of resting, right?

00:35:19.788 --> 00:35:20.068
Resting.

00:35:20.168 --> 00:35:21.188
I'm gonna be sleeping.

00:35:21.448 --> 00:35:22.429
Not just resting.

00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:23.489
Sleeping.

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:24.430
Sleeping.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:29.732
And in between that, I'm gonna be also playing Touhou Fujinroku Mountain of Faith.

00:35:29.772 --> 00:35:33.274
We played it with Marisencho-senpai, but I wanna do some practicing.

00:35:33.694 --> 00:35:35.355
I wanna show I can do it too.

00:35:35.695 --> 00:35:37.216
So that's what I'm gonna do.

00:35:37.856 --> 00:35:39.338
And then Hitman Ruffians!

00:35:39.618 --> 00:35:43.763
You really seem like you wanted me to play this game, so I'm gonna do my best!

00:35:44.544 --> 00:35:47.087
I'm gonna become Fuwawa the Hitman.

00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:48.008
Okay?

00:35:48.608 --> 00:35:49.750
BAU BAU!

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.092
And then a little bit of a peek into our

00:35:52.913 --> 00:35:55.276
Ruffi-huwawa week!

00:35:56.577 --> 00:35:58.238
BAU BAU!

00:35:58.319 --> 00:35:59.039
Ruffians!

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:06.226
For those of you who are joining us through the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO alert!

00:36:06.847 --> 00:36:09.450
It's BAU BAU Cup Noodles!

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.452
BAU BAU!

00:36:13.394 --> 00:36:14.655
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:19.260
Thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:26.949
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:28.290
