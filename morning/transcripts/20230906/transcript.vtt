00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.400
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:10.204
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:12.684
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:17.826
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:19.906
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:33.412
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:38.716
Thank you for joining us today for our 16th episode!

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.701
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:55.026
For Ruffians that are maybe tuning in for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:55.826
A.K.A.

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:56.606
FUWAMOCO!

00:05:56.966 --> 00:06:00.548
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:02.849
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:05.930
and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.711
Ruffians, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:15.512
Never quite get it, huh?

00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:19.373
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new morning!

00:06:19.393 --> 00:06:20.753
What type of morning?

00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:23.994
A brand new... FUWAMOCO morning.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:24.734
Yes!

00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:30.376
A brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:32.990
Well, Ruffians.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.871
Guess what?

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:39.333
There's another Ruffian who's seen Pero.

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:43.475
Yeah, this time... Where?

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:44.976
Where, Moco-chan?

00:06:45.016 --> 00:06:48.818
He's in the kitchen!

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:49.799
The kitchen?

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.262
It looks like this Ruffian was putting lots of love into making pon-de-rings.

00:06:55.342 --> 00:06:59.224
At least, attempting a very good attempt at making pon-de-rings.

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:06.101
I feel like this must be one of the bravest, the most brave Ruffians ever.

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:07.724
The bravest, the most brave.

00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:10.868
In case you didn't understand bravest.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.635
Ruffians, you know, it's probably best...

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:22.781
It may be a bit tempting, but you know, don't try to make pon-de-rings at home, okay?

00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.804
Not unless you have some very strong fire resistance magic.

00:07:27.904 --> 00:07:30.206
Yeah, it can be a bit perilous.

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:33.788
This is why Mister Donut is obviously the best.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.211
Because you don't need to make them if you can buy them.

00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:42.174
Pon-de-rings, you know, they seem easy to make in theory,

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:50.147
Actually, they're really tricky and a bit dangerous to try to make.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.611
Please don't burn down your house trying to make them.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:57.339
But I guess you know, maybe if you see Pero there, then it's okay.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:08.686
We don't dislike Pero that much.

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:12.449
I don't know if we can say that we like him, but we don't dislike him that much.

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:14.231
Yeah, we wouldn't want him to burn to death.

00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:17.633
Yeah, we definitely know it speaking from experience.

00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:18.334
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:34.705
Yeah, hopefully you enjoyed them.

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:40.047
And maybe without Pero swallowing any between blanks or something.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:41.088
And no fire.

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:42.328
No danger.

00:08:42.368 --> 00:08:43.589
No danger, no burns.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.350
BAU BAU!

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.630
Thank you!

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.552
Please, Ruffians, let us know if you see Pero around, okay?

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:55.494
Remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING if you see her.

00:08:56.414 --> 00:08:56.854
BAU BAU!

00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:57.855
Thank you!

00:08:58.355 --> 00:08:59.355
Enjoy the yummies.

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:03.937
Ah, pon-de-ring sounds good right now, right?

00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:04.317
Ah, right!

00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:05.917
A good way to start the morning, right?

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:07.097
Yeah!

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:10.478
Is it?

00:09:11.098 --> 00:09:11.398
Is it?

00:09:12.378 --> 00:09:12.879
What's wrong?

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:14.719
Is it that kind of time, Moco-chan?

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:15.639
Time for what?

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:17.600
I think it's time for that.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.580
Ruffians!

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.901
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:27.082
Something you know that Moco-chan needs to kind of clear up, I think.

00:09:27.222 --> 00:09:27.302
Me?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.222
Yeah, you, Moco-chan.

00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:36.572
You know... There's something on my mind.

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:38.433
On Moco-chan's mind.

00:09:38.473 --> 00:09:39.874
It should be on your mind too, Moco-chan.

00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:40.854
Is it on my mind?

00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:41.455
Yeah.

00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:42.775
What is in my mind?

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:45.957
About, you know, a dear album member.

00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:46.017
So...

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:57.787
I saw that there were some Ruffians were concerned about how Moco-chan talked to Nerissa during a recent collab in Pico Park.

00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:03.210
Yeah, Moco-chan, you said that you were going to clean Nerissa up because she was dirty.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:09.073
Moco-chan, what do you have to say about this?

00:10:15.296 --> 00:10:16.237
No reaction?

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.031
I don't know.

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:19.872
Was I wrong?

00:10:19.892 --> 00:10:22.694
It's not wrong.

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.336
Is it really a misunderstanding?

00:10:27.298 --> 00:10:28.399
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:29.079
It's bad.

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:29.880
It's not good.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.601
I did nothing wrong, right?

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.444
The whistle... The whistle's not dirty.

00:10:36.545 --> 00:10:36.825
What?

00:10:37.226 --> 00:10:40.368
You don't... You don't actually think the whistle's dirty, do you, Ruffians?

00:10:40.388 --> 00:10:40.989
Mococo is right!

00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:42.250
Mococo is right!

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.270
Yeah.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:49.681
No!

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:51.723
No, Moco-chan, you... No.

00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:53.304
I'm correct.

00:10:53.644 --> 00:10:54.005
No.

00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:54.425
Yeah.

00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:55.065
No!

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:57.267
I'm gonna purify her!

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:01.030
Purify the demon of sound!

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.313
Get rid of the nasty demon that's inside of her!

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:07.835
Moco-chan, you know what demons do?

00:11:10.116 --> 00:11:12.798
I think Mococo could cure her of her dirtiness!

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:13.239
Yeah!

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:15.180
I'm here to help you, Nerissa!

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.941
Morning deshita.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.273
Now Moco-chan, you're referring to yourself as Mococo.

00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:23.414
Third person.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.696
If I'm gonna clean her, then yes.

00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:29.199
Watch out, Nerissa.

00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:31.240
Moco-chan took your duty.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.501
You're welcome!

00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:35.083
Was that an apology at all, Moco-chan?

00:11:35.183 --> 00:11:37.025
If it wasn't a misunderstanding.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:39.507
Was it?

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:40.688
Sorry, Nerissa.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.491
Wow!

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.054
There's actually been something else on our minds.

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:49.856
Maybe something we wanted to confess a bit.

00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:52.077
Ruffians.

00:11:53.558 --> 00:12:00.363
You know, this time, we have something we'd like to confess about a senpai in particular.

00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:05.487
We all know she's very, very cool.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:11.336
We have a lot of very cool senpai.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.516
We do, we do.

00:12:12.876 --> 00:12:20.038
But recently when we think of this senpai, we even get a bit teary because she's just that cool!

00:12:20.098 --> 00:12:21.098
Oh, maybe it's just you.

00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:23.119
I would never get teary.

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:25.339
Moco-chan's just saying that.

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:26.660
Ruffians, can you guess?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.000
Can you guess?

00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:34.823
I think she's definitely gonna think we're weird for this.

00:12:35.483 --> 00:12:35.624
Oh!

00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:36.284
Oh!

00:12:36.765 --> 00:12:36.905
Oh!

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:37.486
I see it!

00:12:38.407 --> 00:12:39.608
There's a lot of Senpai.

00:12:39.868 --> 00:12:40.709
There's a lot of Senpai.

00:12:43.587 --> 00:12:46.310
It's Calli-senpai!

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.391
Moco-chan, thank you for the drawing.

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:49.292
You're welcome.

00:12:49.772 --> 00:12:50.573
It's very good.

00:12:51.334 --> 00:12:52.275
Exactly the same.

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:56.238
Yeah, you know, Calli-senpai's super busy, right?

00:12:56.258 --> 00:13:05.046
You know, she has her new EP, Jigoku 6, that just came out, and has been on a bunch of TV shows and music TV shows recently.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:09.409
But despite her busy schedule, she still makes time for us and Advent, too.

00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:17.305
You know, she responds to our messages even though we're really, we're pretty sure she's in the middle of really important meetings.

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:19.406
And you know, we're pretty sure.

00:13:19.446 --> 00:13:20.127
Pretty sure.

00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:25.650
And when we message her, you know, say crazy things like this and that.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.391
Just crazy things, you know.

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:30.092
She's really sweet in response.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:33.514
And she stands up for others and for what she feels is right.

00:13:33.534 --> 00:13:34.055
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:36.536
We feel really lucky to have a senpai like her, you know.

00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:38.317
That's really, really cool.

00:13:38.477 --> 00:13:38.857
That's cool.

00:13:38.897 --> 00:13:39.057
Yeah.

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:39.838
And to be...

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:49.545
To be completely honest, it's not like we've been talking a bunch together through DMs because FUWAMOCO, you know, we have a hard time getting the courage from it, right?

00:13:49.785 --> 00:13:52.407
But this is still how we feel inside.

00:13:52.627 --> 00:13:53.728
It's tough, you know?

00:13:54.348 --> 00:13:56.070
And you know what too?

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.633
With FUWAMOCO, we were having a bit of a rough day the other day.

00:14:00.653 --> 00:14:04.835
Calli-senpai, she said that she lent us a copy of

00:14:05.956 --> 00:14:09.437
Her game that we were having a really hard time getting.

00:14:09.477 --> 00:14:11.878
Well, not her game, but our game, she has.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:12.758
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:15.599
You know, and that meant so much to us.

00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:18.700
It's just, it's just maybe like a little thing.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.880
Yeah, she didn't need to.

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:21.281
Right?

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:22.381
But it was very nice.

00:14:22.581 --> 00:14:23.021
Right?

00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:28.243
You know, we're kind of thinking that, Ruffians, do you know the rules of Versailles?

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:31.344
Do you know the legendary rules of Versailles?

00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:35.057
I feel like Calli-senpai is a bit like Oscar.

00:14:35.257 --> 00:14:35.477
Yeah.

00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:36.377
You know?

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:37.157
That's our thought.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:37.917
Yeah.

00:14:38.057 --> 00:14:41.338
She looks pretty similar the way I do her.

00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:43.878
But you know Calli-senpai's very cool.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.278
Very, very cool.

00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:49.399
Wanting to put herself in danger to protect those important.

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:50.679
You know?

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.259
Just like Oscar!

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.840
In danger.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.680
Yeah.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.400
That's our senpai.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:57.900
Danger.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.121
Dangerous.

00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:01.361
Like, giving a game.

00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:02.802
Very dangerous.

00:15:05.783 --> 00:15:06.864
BAU BAU!

00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:09.385
That's what we wanted to confess.

00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:13.927
Well, Ruffians.

00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:18.370
We also heard that it's a new time of year.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.970
It's that time of year.

00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:22.932
It's back to school!

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.553
Back to school season.

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:33.536
We really wanted to give a big BAU BAU to any Ruffians who are returning back to school to continue their studies.

00:15:33.656 --> 00:15:35.619
We're sure it's really rough on it.

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:44.349
New class, new faces, new strict teachers, and worst of all, mountains of homework and texts to read.

00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:47.466
But Ruffians, you can do it!

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:47.966
Yeah!

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:48.767
Hang in there!

00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:48.907
Yeah!

00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:53.808
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've done a lot of training as Demon Guard Dogs.

00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:56.388
And you know, it was really rough.

00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:57.808
Really rough.

00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:09.751
Yeah, we still always have more training to do, but... You know, Ruffians, we take you on, but we found something more important to protect right now.

00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:10.531
Right!

00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:10.891
Right.

00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:12.212
Protect you.

00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:12.692
Yeah.

00:16:12.772 --> 00:16:14.152
I think we've done enough training.

00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:18.569
You may be a little bit surprised.

00:16:35.147 --> 00:16:36.168
We are pretty good at it.

00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:37.748
Yeah, we did learn that stuff.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.089
Yeah, very studious.

00:16:39.149 --> 00:16:44.291
You know, we never made any excuses like, teacher the dog ate our homework!

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:45.211
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:50.773
And we never, you know, Moco-chan never switched spots and did my test or something.

00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:51.354
You know?

00:16:51.374 --> 00:16:54.075
Yeah, we're good students.

00:16:54.255 --> 00:16:54.795
Even math.

00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:55.835
Even math.

00:16:58.034 --> 00:17:01.898
I cried a lot while I was doing math.

00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:04.380
But yeah, math.

00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.804
And even though it was really hard, it wasn't good.

00:17:07.824 --> 00:17:11.047
It felt, you know, kind of just like prison.

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.189
Just like we were in the cell.

00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.125
It makes us feel a bit sick.

00:17:18.285 --> 00:17:19.325
Just thinking about it.

00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:21.706
Not great.

00:17:21.806 --> 00:17:31.450
So, we really wanted to give a big support of BAU BAU to all the Ruffians doing their best to improve themselves and learn as much as they can!

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.111
Ruffians!

00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:33.451
You can do it!

00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:34.532
BAU BAU!

00:17:34.612 --> 00:17:37.473
Get on the school bus!

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.314
Up to the school bus!

00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:41.795
It's time to go to school!

00:17:42.675 --> 00:17:43.355
BAU BAU!

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.996
Good luck!

00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:46.519
Good luck!

00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:48.962
Going to school!

00:17:49.662 --> 00:17:50.263
Going to school!

00:17:50.283 --> 00:17:51.204
They're on the bus now.

00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:52.846
They're going.

00:17:52.866 --> 00:17:54.948
Ruffians, you know what?

00:17:55.028 --> 00:17:55.288
I think

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:16.054
It's another special FUWAMOCO Morning because we have some very special FUWAMOCO Morning Jingles!

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.465
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:18:22.966 --> 00:18:35.190
A week ago, we asked Ruffians to come up with their very best jingles so we could all have a special jingle that we can love lots and lots for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:43.574
Once again, we really want to say a big thank you to every Ruffian for the jingles that they made just for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:48.416
Each and every one has filled us with so much passion and individuality.

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.378
Moco-chan, shall we take a listen?

00:18:51.478 --> 00:18:52.118
Is it okay?

00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:12.607
Okay.

00:19:13.087 --> 00:19:15.549
But Ruffians, remember you have to be like this, okay?

00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:17.409
You have to really get into it.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:17.890
Got it?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.771
Listen very closely, okay?

00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:22.672
Get ready to dance a bit.

00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:23.252
Yeah.

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:24.973
Okay.

00:19:25.673 --> 00:19:27.154
Let's see.

00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:29.675
Who's this first jingle from?

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:37.599
This one is a jingle from... Bo... Ed!

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:38.359
Let's listen!

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.460
De-den!

00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:48.384
It's so cute!

00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:50.665
They said they used an instrument called a Kuika.

00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:52.686
I've never heard of it.

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:53.667
I know, right?

00:19:53.927 --> 00:19:56.448
It's so cute and mysterious.

00:19:57.088 --> 00:19:59.869
It has a puppy vibe to it, right?

00:19:59.969 --> 00:20:04.071
Yeah, I feel like it has a puppy sort of feel.

00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:05.812
Not Donkey Kong.

00:20:05.892 --> 00:20:06.832
Donkey Kong?

00:20:07.252 --> 00:20:07.753
I don't know.

00:20:09.054 --> 00:20:11.296
FUWAMOCO's gonna come and get you!

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.858
We're gonna put a smile on your face!

00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:14.658
I like it.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:18.281
You know, we're definitely up to something again this morning.

00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:20.844
It's silly.

00:20:21.324 --> 00:20:21.984
Thank you!

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:24.567
BAU BAU!

00:20:25.407 --> 00:20:29.531
And next, we have a jingle from Ugokubo.

00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.431
Ugokubo-san.

00:20:30.732 --> 00:20:31.632
Let's listen!

00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:44.891
It has a bit of a futuristic feel to it.

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:49.354
But it's really cute and it has a refreshing feel.

00:20:49.394 --> 00:20:53.136
It feels like carbonated water.

00:20:53.176 --> 00:21:06.865
For me, I feel like it reminds me a bit of when you just finish installing and starting up a visual novel for the first time and you take a look at the game menu.

00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:09.787
You see all the heroines and there's the bright blue sky.

00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:12.830
Next, we have a jingle from Tiana!

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.391
Let's listen!

00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:46.639
Moco-chan, apparently this jingle is done in a genuine PC-98 format!

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:49.182
I like it!

00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:49.922
I like it!

00:21:49.942 --> 00:21:50.483
Amazing!

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:51.384
Impressive!

00:21:53.528 --> 00:21:55.050
I get too many good feelings.

00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:59.074
It hits you in the bones.

00:21:59.114 --> 00:22:03.539
A blanket that I've had for many, many, many thousands of years.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:10.947
I don't think we talked about this before, but FUWAMOCO, we really, really love the PC-98.

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:20.170
It's one of our dreams to actually have a working PC-90 and be able to play classic visual novels on it.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:20.691
Someday!

00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:21.391
Someday.

00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:23.311
It's a bone blanket, yes.

00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:26.552
Right, the vibe is so good.

00:22:26.972 --> 00:22:27.652
Thank you!

00:22:27.672 --> 00:22:28.432
BAU BAU!

00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:32.233
BAU BAU!

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:33.513
That was really cool.

00:22:33.973 --> 00:22:37.814
Well, this next submission is from Genji!

00:22:38.074 --> 00:22:39.034
Let's take a listen.

00:22:53.046 --> 00:22:55.828
This is a jingle played on the shamisen.

00:22:55.888 --> 00:22:58.870
Ruffians, do you know what the shamisen is?

00:23:01.352 --> 00:23:01.853
I wonder.

00:23:01.873 --> 00:23:05.675
It might be a lot of Ruffians' first time with a shamisen.

00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:10.579
A shamisen is a Japanese lute that's played by plucking three different strings with a...

00:23:12.295 --> 00:23:12.595
A thing.

00:23:12.915 --> 00:23:14.676
A thing called a bachi.

00:23:14.696 --> 00:23:17.237
Yeah, it's really really cool.

00:23:17.497 --> 00:23:20.098
They're so good at it too.

00:23:20.418 --> 00:23:24.559
I think it must be really difficult to learn how to play the shamisen.

00:23:25.019 --> 00:23:28.540
Especially if you're a Ruffian that's outside of Japan maybe.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.141
A lot of Ruffians know about it.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:32.862
They wrote a paper on it.

00:23:33.262 --> 00:23:35.323
Wow, this is really impressive too.

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:42.886
I like the really like, there's like a happy, a happy like traditional feeling from it.

00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:46.448
It's funny because it feels also healing but different from the bone blanket.

00:23:46.488 --> 00:23:50.630
Yeah, I want to put on a kimono now after listening to it.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.691
Thank you Genji-mama!

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:57.754
And our last single for today.

00:23:58.434 --> 00:24:00.395
This one is from Kendo!

00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:00.955
Kendo!

00:24:01.335 --> 00:24:03.757
Let's take a quick, a quick listen.

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:15.767
Hi!

00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:17.148
You're so cute!

00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:18.749
You're happiness!

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:19.409
BAU BAU!

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:22.030
It reminds me kinda like a...

00:24:23.954 --> 00:24:30.336
When you just start a really colorful co-op game, you know maybe it has like pixel graphics?

00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:33.098
Sort of similar but different from Cookie and Cream.

00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:34.378
So cute!

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:45.062
And I really like the use of our voices and the little ting at the end too.

00:24:45.082 --> 00:24:46.042
And the bonflowers!

00:24:48.197 --> 00:24:48.657
Thank you!

00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:52.319
Thank you for the BAU BAU!

00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:53.880
BAU BAU!

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.840
Thank you!

00:24:55.421 --> 00:24:56.962
BAU BAU!

00:24:57.002 --> 00:24:57.542
BAU BAU!

00:24:58.082 --> 00:25:01.724
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your jingles.

00:25:01.784 --> 00:25:05.286
And thank you for letting us share them today with you!

00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:09.628
We hope you enjoyed these few ones that we were able to showcase today.

00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:14.250
And we hope that you look forward to the big reveal that's waiting for us on Friday.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.972
It's only two sleeps away, right, Moco-chan?

00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:18.781
Yes.

00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:19.521
Yes.

00:25:21.342 --> 00:25:24.103
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:25.043
They're so good.

00:25:27.344 --> 00:25:29.705
Ruffians are just very, very impressive.

00:25:29.765 --> 00:25:31.365
What can I say?

00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:33.166
Are you surprised, Moco-chan?

00:25:33.546 --> 00:25:36.167
No, I'm not surprised, but I'm just very impressed.

00:25:38.448 --> 00:25:47.071
But, Ruffians, on the topic of being impressed, I wanted to say something!

00:25:48.106 --> 00:25:49.466
Is it okay if I say something?

00:25:51.287 --> 00:25:53.587
It doesn't matter because I'm gonna say it anyways!

00:25:54.247 --> 00:25:58.168
You know, today, it's the middle of the week!

00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:02.789
And you know, recently, it's been sort of rough.

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:10.151
So, it's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:14.732
And that means you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo.

00:26:17.225 --> 00:26:17.625
Yo!

00:26:18.626 --> 00:26:19.386
Ruffian!

00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:21.407
It's Wednesday!

00:26:21.888 --> 00:26:23.609
And maybe even Thursday!

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:26.370
Congratulations!

00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:29.432
You thought the other day would take you down, didn't you?

00:26:29.452 --> 00:26:29.912
Huh?

00:26:31.113 --> 00:26:32.093
But guess what?

00:26:32.514 --> 00:26:33.054
It didn't!

00:26:33.914 --> 00:26:36.696
And that's because you're super duper strong!

00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:38.417
You're amazing!

00:26:38.657 --> 00:26:39.858
You're doing it!

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.579
Rain or shine, you continue to go.

00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:45.141
And that is something that you need to recognize.

00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:45.641
Got it?

00:26:47.028 --> 00:26:47.548
Got it!

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:49.169
You can do it!

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.331
We can all do it together!

00:26:52.312 --> 00:26:59.477
And after this FUWAMOCO Morning, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna show the world just how awesome you are!

00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:05.541
Let's take all the silly things in stride and continue to be in control of our own world, okay?

00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:07.122
Got it?

00:27:08.283 --> 00:27:11.425
Cuz remember, I believe in you!

00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:12.966
You can do it!

00:27:13.526 --> 00:27:14.507
Ganbatte ne!

00:27:22.585 --> 00:27:25.227
That was a good Pup Talk, Moco-chan.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.372
You got this, Ruffians!

00:27:31.412 --> 00:27:35.535
You can do it!

00:27:35.855 --> 00:27:38.778
Moco-chan, shall we go to our regular corners?

00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:40.599
Doggie of the Day deshita.

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:43.522
Okay, but who's our Doggie of the Day today?

00:27:45.712 --> 00:27:48.335
It's Juju!

00:27:48.715 --> 00:27:52.940
Look at this BAU-tiful smile!

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.284
Actually, I feel like this is very impressive.

00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:59.627
Can you see those, Moco-chan?

00:27:59.907 --> 00:28:02.209
All those healthy white teeth there.

00:28:04.431 --> 00:28:05.312
Just like Moco-chan.

00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:07.713
Just like Moco-chan.

00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:11.275
Dogs' teeth are really important to their health, right?

00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:12.936
Just like Ruffians.

00:28:15.078 --> 00:28:16.879
You brush your teeth, right, Ruffians?

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:18.660
It's already FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.980
You brush your teeth, right?

00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:20.661
Go!

00:28:20.861 --> 00:28:22.042
Grab your tooth brush!

00:28:22.182 --> 00:28:23.623
You brush your teeth, right!

00:28:23.823 --> 00:28:26.845
You know what you can do while FUWAMOCO Morning is on, too?

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:28.130
Juju.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.032
Juju's a German Shepherd.

00:28:30.072 --> 00:28:30.593
Kind of like, uh...

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.771
You know, German Shepherds kinda similar.

00:28:50.871 --> 00:28:52.532
I don't think we have as much whiskers.

00:28:53.152 --> 00:28:53.592
Ah, no.

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:55.253
Juju has wonderful whiskers.

00:28:55.733 --> 00:29:00.134
But, I think German Shepherds, they like guarding and protecting things, right?

00:29:01.335 --> 00:29:05.096
I'm sure Juju's really good at protecting smiles, you know?

00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:06.897
So cute.

00:29:07.737 --> 00:29:10.438
We're glad that Juju's still lovely.

00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:12.079
A happy friend.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:13.259
Do we have whiskers?

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.060
Just use your eyes.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.141
Use your brain.

00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:20.726
How does Juju bau bau?

00:29:21.366 --> 00:29:27.829
I feel like through the teeth, you know, like... Yeah, you know, I think Juju...

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.572
Has a very good sense of humor.

00:29:40.672 --> 00:29:47.795
You can see through the sparkly smile, sparkly eyes, a bit shadowy there, but I'm sure they're sparkly.

00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:49.916
Strong gommas, yeah.

00:29:50.076 --> 00:29:52.177
And you do have some very cute ears.

00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:55.018
You can't quite see here, but gravity.

00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:56.118
Ravity.

00:29:56.238 --> 00:29:59.460
No, no, gravity!

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.720
No gravity!

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.461
Gravity!

00:30:01.741 --> 00:30:02.921
They're very cute.

00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:04.442
Oh, Juju!

00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:08.284
Keep doing your best to protect your Ruffian smile, okay?

00:30:09.324 --> 00:30:12.265
That's all the memory to smile just as big as Juju!

00:30:18.428 --> 00:30:29.692
And next, for today, I went on a walk with a Ruffian.

00:30:30.073 --> 00:30:31.693
Oh, this Ruffian is active!

00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:32.454
Very active.

00:30:32.474 --> 00:30:33.854
They went for a hike.

00:30:33.894 --> 00:30:34.494
Dangerous.

00:30:34.735 --> 00:30:38.316
And what's even better, I think Moco-chan

00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:44.058
They made a friend along the way, too!

00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:45.519
Is it a squirrel?

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:46.999
A chipmunk?

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.600
A tiny friend?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.020
A rodent?

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.681
Whatever it is, I want to point.

00:30:53.961 --> 00:30:57.402
You know, it kind of looks like one of the rodents in the cartoons.

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:57.982
Risu-senpai?

00:30:58.082 --> 00:31:00.763
I don't think Risu-senpai is quite that small.

00:31:00.783 --> 00:31:02.403
She's much cuter, she's much cuter.

00:31:05.242 --> 00:31:09.125
But you know, I think they probably got really close to you, right?

00:31:09.805 --> 00:31:11.606
Either that or you're really good at photography.

00:31:11.646 --> 00:31:12.447
Really good friends.

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:15.889
National Geographic.

00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:24.095
But yes, you know Ruffians, it's very important not to feed the wildlife, you know, no matter how much we might want to.

00:31:24.535 --> 00:31:25.296
And look for it.

00:31:25.576 --> 00:31:26.136
Look for it!

00:31:28.818 --> 00:31:29.599
Look for it to.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.351
We can't have snacks.

00:31:32.812 --> 00:31:34.253
It's for their sake.

00:31:34.293 --> 00:31:35.474
We eat our snacks.

00:31:37.657 --> 00:31:39.658
They eat their snacks.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:03.663
It could be fun, you have to dodge them.

00:32:03.683 --> 00:32:06.265
I mean, get ready to dodge.

00:32:06.285 --> 00:32:09.987
I prefer that in my video games, not in real life.

00:32:10.547 --> 00:32:12.708
It's the fun part of hiking, okay?

00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:14.629
You never know what's gonna happen.

00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:17.551
Make some friends, dodge some rocks.

00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:18.231
Exactly!

00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:21.112
Ruffians make sure you go on lots of walks, okay?

00:32:22.486 --> 00:32:23.188
Falling rocks.

00:32:23.268 --> 00:32:23.849
Rocks and rocks.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:24.451
BAU BAU!

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.722
Next we have our Question of the Day.

00:32:36.703 --> 00:32:39.244
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

00:32:39.544 --> 00:32:42.805
It's already September, and it's the season for School Trip!

00:32:42.845 --> 00:32:49.428
Whenever it comes to this time, I always recall the days of school trips back in my high school.

00:32:49.828 --> 00:32:52.109
Do you have similar experiences when you were students?

00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:53.670
I'd like to hear from you.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.011
Thank you for your question!

00:32:56.711 --> 00:33:02.496
Ah, well, FUWAMOCO, we have never really been on a shugaku-ryoku like they do in Japan, you know?

00:33:02.656 --> 00:33:04.057
It sounds fun.

00:33:04.578 --> 00:33:04.918
Right?

00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:11.704
Sometimes there'd be like little trips to like a museum where we'd learn about the great Demon Guard Dogs of the past.

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.466
But... I don't know.

00:33:14.986 --> 00:33:17.448
It's nice being out, but it's not really that fun.

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:18.409
It wasn't that fun.

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.751
You know, they make you do homework after that.

00:33:20.771 --> 00:33:21.512
It's blaaaah.

00:33:23.214 --> 00:33:25.596
It'd be fun if I just learned and didn't have to do work.

00:33:25.976 --> 00:33:26.717
Right?

00:33:27.057 --> 00:33:30.039
But, you know, it looks really fun in anime.

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:32.922
You know, they go to Hokkaido for sugaku ryoko.

00:33:33.002 --> 00:33:33.682
Yeah!

00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:37.765
They have a bunch of yummy food, and fun, and great sights.

00:33:37.825 --> 00:33:43.810
And at the end of the busy day, everyone all sleeps in the same room together.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.752
Like a sleepover party, right?

00:33:46.713 --> 00:33:49.455
Is that really a trip or is it just a vacation?

00:33:49.475 --> 00:33:50.937
I feel like it's kind of a vacation.

00:33:50.997 --> 00:33:51.757
A vacation?

00:33:52.018 --> 00:33:54.440
I don't know, I kind of feel... A vacation with friends.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:01.005
I feel a little bit envious, you know, when we see Shugaku Ryokan anime.

00:34:01.165 --> 00:34:03.327
You know, it's like, it's a multiple

00:34:03.467 --> 00:34:05.448
Day trip without parents, right?

00:34:05.568 --> 00:34:06.828
Yeah, it'd be fun.

00:34:06.908 --> 00:34:17.292
I mean, museums are fun, but I like it when we have to... We can just enjoy and learn like that instead of have to be focused on the homework and getting information for that.

00:34:17.492 --> 00:34:18.472
No, no pressure.

00:34:18.512 --> 00:34:19.513
Just learning is good.

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:23.934
But considering, you know, shugaku ryoko usually doesn't... The teachers come along, right?

00:34:23.954 --> 00:34:24.935
But there's no parents.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:30.116
I feel like that would've been something we would've never been allowed to do, right?

00:34:31.257 --> 00:34:31.357
Aww.

00:34:34.647 --> 00:34:43.215
But, you know, even though our youth spent in the classroom may be over now, I think your youth only ends when you decide it has.

00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:49.240
So, you know, Ruffians, let's all continue our burning youth all together!

00:34:58.149 --> 00:35:04.296
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today.

00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:08.241
Remember though, we're still looking constantly, every day.

00:35:08.581 --> 00:35:14.664
For more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day, for your walks, and of course more questions too!

00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:22.409
We wanted to say, you know, we are always keeping an eye on the hashtag, but if you want to retweet your submissions, tweet them again.

00:35:22.929 --> 00:35:29.173
Because you think maybe they might have been missed or it's been a little while and you still haven't been on FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:31.014
Please, please do, okay?

00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:38.818
Also, you know, I think maybe some Ruffians, they only have one doggy of a day.

00:35:38.838 --> 00:35:42.300
I would hope that their doggy is a doggy of every day.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.202
Yeah, but you know you're not gonna be switching out your dogs.

00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:48.324
So, I was gonna say...

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.785
And for our next stream, what do we have up next?

00:35:53.825 --> 00:35:54.365
We have...

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:12.079
Our album!

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:13.040
Album!

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:13.720
Album!

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.021
We're gonna be making our debut in the hololive Minecraft server.

00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:21.722
And for us, it's Minecraft debut.

00:36:21.982 --> 00:36:23.042
Yeah.

00:36:23.362 --> 00:36:24.622
We're really, really nervous.

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:24.842
Yes.

00:36:26.343 --> 00:36:26.803
Yeah.

00:36:27.123 --> 00:36:29.083
We've never played Minecraft.

00:36:29.123 --> 00:36:31.964
We've watched Minecraft, but I don't know what's going on.

00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:32.504
Yeah.

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:36.445
We're just like, oh, this is cool, but I'm lost.

00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:37.205
They're not lost.

00:36:37.645 --> 00:36:38.766
I don't know what they're doing.

00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:40.286
There's a lot of sounds, but yeah.

00:36:40.746 --> 00:36:43.567
And you know we were having a bunch of issues today.

00:36:43.587 --> 00:36:53.192
So we tried to test it before FUWAMOCO Morning did it, but... We ran into Mikocchi-senpai, and Okayu-senpai, and Aki-senpai!

00:36:54.293 --> 00:36:55.353
And you know what?

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:59.135
I didn't even know how to type or move around or anything.

00:36:59.235 --> 00:37:01.296
So we just sort of panicked a bit.

00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:04.618
Googling how to type in Minecraft!

00:37:04.678 --> 00:37:06.158
How to jump in Minecraft!

00:37:06.238 --> 00:37:06.879
We didn't get that far.

00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:09.140
How do we bow in Minecraft?

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.942
But it was fun though!

00:37:12.082 --> 00:37:13.263
But very overwhelming.

00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:19.027
Thank you Mikochi-senpai for all the takoyaki!

00:37:19.067 --> 00:37:20.848
Moco-chan shared one with me.

00:37:20.868 --> 00:37:22.729
I promised to share.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.430
Just one.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.871
More.

00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:30.495
But you know, because of it, I think we're looking forward to Minecraft even more now, right?

00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:33.697
It was fun, wasn't it?

00:37:34.037 --> 00:37:37.099
But the debut is just about to start today.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:37.860
Tonight.

00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:42.404
Please look forward to as much as we are, Ruffians!

00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:44.306
BAU BAU!

00:37:45.507 --> 00:37:45.667
And!

00:37:45.928 --> 00:37:47.149
Our schedule!

00:37:47.169 --> 00:37:48.690
Look at the schedule.

00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:52.634
Wow, we still have a lot of exciting things happening this week.

00:37:53.115 --> 00:37:53.395
But!

00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:59.982
On Friday, we have a Japanese lesson with all of Abyss going right on up.

00:38:00.422 --> 00:38:01.063
Teacher!

00:38:01.123 --> 00:38:02.844
FUWAMOCO Teacher!

00:38:03.345 --> 00:38:11.733
We're going to be teaching from the very basics up until having a regular conversation with all of you in Japanese.

00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:14.035
We're really looking forward to it.

00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:18.119
We've never spoken in Japanese and had a conversation with all of you before.

00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:20.841
Ruffians!

00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:25.566
We wanted to ask though, is there anything in particular that you want us to teach them?

00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:27.948
Do you have any ideas, Ruffians?

00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:38.702
Bad words.

00:38:39.563 --> 00:38:43.968
We have to use good words with our senpai, okay?

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:47.792
But Ruffians, you don't have to try to think right now.

00:38:48.152 --> 00:38:52.236
Let us know with the hashtag, this time, hashtag helpFWMC.

00:38:55.019 --> 00:38:57.181
F-W-M-O-C-O.

00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:02.785
And that way, you know, we might be able to include it in our lesson plan, right?

00:39:03.005 --> 00:39:06.127
Because we're teachers, we need to have a lesson plan.

00:39:06.408 --> 00:39:07.228
Preparation.

00:39:07.268 --> 00:39:08.209
Yeah, it's good.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.031
You can't think right on the spot, right?

00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:12.392
That's okay.

00:39:12.432 --> 00:39:17.636
But the sooner you can think of it and tweet about it, that would be appreciated.

00:39:18.476 --> 00:39:20.518
Lesson plan has to get written pretty quickly.

00:39:22.459 --> 00:39:24.341
BAU BAU!

00:39:24.642 --> 00:39:31.489
