Both of us!

05:16.090 --> 05:25.012
Thank you so much for waking up early and joining us today for our 99th episode!

05:25.032 --> 05:25.012
99!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.393
Can you believe it?

05:27.473 --> 05:32.674
The last episode of FUWAMOCO Morning with two numbers beside it.

05:33.795 --> 05:35.075
Are you sad, Ruffians?

05:37.074 --> 05:40.375
We have one more before 100!

05:40.415 --> 05:43.856
That's how it works, right?

05:44.096 --> 05:46.336
Numbers, huh?

05:46.356 --> 05:47.356
BAU BAU!

05:48.677 --> 05:50.877
Your two numbers is over.

05:50.897 --> 05:55.298
A little bit lonely, but you cried a little!

05:55.318 --> 05:56.378
Don't worry!

05:56.478 --> 05:59.479
It's still early for that!

05:59.679 --> 06:03.560
But that means we'll be getting a new number for next time, right?

06:05.307 --> 06:06.193
Is that how it works?

06:06.293 --> 06:07.159
I numbers friends.

06:07.179 --> 06:08.406
Not my friends.

06:09.881 --> 06:11.701

06:11.921 --> 06:22.644
Well, for any Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:22.764 --> 06:23.804

Moco-chan, where'd the second hashtag go?

06:45.043 --> 06:49.044
I didn't see hashtag, hashtag denied!

06:49.104 --> 06:54.846

You really want it.

07:12.585 --> 07:13.787
It's necessary!

07:14.347 --> 07:15.449
Necessary!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.492
You have to say pretty please, Ruffians!

07:18.934 --> 07:19.815
Pretty please!

07:20.055 --> 07:21.057
Pretty please!

07:21.077 --> 07:21.317
Ruffians!

07:24.301 --> 07:25.662
If you put it that nicely then.

07:26.403 --> 07:30.626

Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:36.570 --> 07:37.351
BAU BAU!

07:37.371 --> 07:39.512
Hashtag hashtag.

07:40.033 --> 07:40.593
BAU BAU!

07:43.419 --> 07:47.000
Wow, I didn't expect that kind of reaction, huh?

07:47.060 --> 07:49.140
That's more like it!

07:49.220 --> 07:51.900
Ruffians still saying pretty please!

07:53.361 --> 07:58.962
If you ask Ruffians to say pretty please, they'll continue saying it for a very long time.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.422
Your day is made!

08:04.103 --> 08:05.963
Well, I'm just about to ruin it.

08:06.783 --> 08:10.344
Guys, there's been another peron sighting.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.027
You know, recently it's been pretty bad.

08:17.087 --> 08:19.229
Pero's been seen in a bunch of places.

08:19.469 --> 08:20.010
Yeah.

08:21.691 --> 08:23.112
What place has he been seen now?

08:23.633 --> 08:25.214
Well, let's take a look.

08:26.855 --> 08:29.017
De-den!

08:29.698 --> 08:31.800
Oh no.

08:31.820 --> 08:37.905
Did Pero sneak into your PC and cause problems?

08:38.745 --> 08:42.649
Ruffians, have you been having any computer troubles?

08:44.641 --> 08:46.523
Has it been slow and mild?

08:46.543 --> 08:51.208
You know, maybe you should open it up and check things out.

08:52.089 --> 08:59.898
Otherwise, a big blob with ears and wings could have installed himself without you knowing.

09:00.638 --> 09:01.720
Pero Sensor.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.381
Pero Peace.

09:06.039 --> 09:06.720
Ruffians!

09:25.402 --> 09:30.547
I'm pretty sure there's been more than a few Ruffians with this issue though before, right, Moco-chan?

09:30.567 --> 09:32.529
I think I saw some, hi.

09:32.910 --> 09:39.056
Ruffians, you need to make sure that you keep yourself and your computer safe, okay?

09:40.197 --> 09:41.859
You're one to speak, hi!

09:42.259 --> 09:44.222
You need to stay safe, okay?

09:44.282 --> 09:45.563
Not wearing a virus.

09:45.923 --> 09:46.324
Yeah.

09:48.115 --> 09:52.196
But your computer is not an appropriate place for Pero to be staying in.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.557
And you know what?

09:54.017 --> 09:57.518
He'll stay there forever if he thinks he can get away with it.

09:57.538 --> 09:57.978
He will.

09:57.998 --> 09:58.818
Yeah.

09:58.918 --> 10:00.359
You wouldn't want that, huh?

10:00.819 --> 10:01.079
Yeah.

10:01.159 --> 10:01.479
No.

10:01.639 --> 10:10.422
Ruffians, you know, if your computer, if it's slowing down and there are loud sounds from it, especially if it's like a really nasty loud.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.642
Gotta check it out right away, okay?

10:12.822 --> 10:13.363
Yeah, okay.

10:13.403 --> 10:15.043
Can't put it off, okay?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.844
You have to be proactive.

10:20.814 --> 10:21.575
Peroactive.

10:22.396 --> 10:23.217
Okay, Moco-chan.

10:23.237 --> 10:23.498
Proactive!

10:23.538 --> 10:23.818

10:24.760 --> 10:27.484
Okay, Moco-chan.

10:29.106 --> 10:29.366
Yeah.

10:36.107 --> 10:37.528

11:06.127 --> 11:08.148

11:09.688 --> 11:11.549
We're so excited!

11:11.829 --> 11:11.969
Yeah!

11:12.029 --> 11:13.850
Did you hear about the opening?

11:13.870 --> 11:14.690
It's huge!

11:14.770 --> 11:16.010
Yeah, and the anime!

11:16.311 --> 11:19.352
It's called My Wife Has No Emotion.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.793
And the song is called Okaerinasai.

11:23.813 --> 11:24.733
So cute!

11:24.913 --> 11:27.434
And I am so excited!

11:27.514 --> 11:28.335
Yeah, yeah!

11:28.615 --> 11:31.936
Not just because you know Sora-senpai sang the opening theme song.

11:31.976 --> 11:33.316
Very exciting, very exciting!

11:33.616 --> 11:34.177
It's because...

11:35.417 --> 11:36.378
There's Mii Robots.

11:36.678 --> 11:40.302
And I love Mii Robots!

11:40.622 --> 11:42.744
Especially when they fall in love.

11:45.146 --> 11:47.948
So I'll definitely be watching this anime.

11:48.188 --> 11:51.071
It starts airing at the beginning of next month.

11:51.131 --> 11:51.651
So soon.

11:52.632 --> 11:54.294
Right soon!

11:55.315 --> 11:57.697
It sounds so cute!

11:58.217 --> 12:00.519
And I will probably cry a bunch.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.922
You can actually already check out the song as well!

12:03.102 --> 12:04.123
Yeah!

12:04.203 --> 12:07.526
Check out Tokinosora-senpai on Twitter!

12:12.350 --> 12:13.151
BAU BAU!

12:36.123 --> 12:37.724

12:37.764 --> 12:42.905
We can sing anime opening songs here!

12:44.025 --> 12:44.525
One day.

12:44.665 --> 12:45.426
One day maybe.

12:45.466 --> 12:46.846
Yeah, not today.

12:46.886 --> 12:47.566
Not tomorrow.

12:48.206 --> 12:48.606
One day.

12:48.866 --> 12:49.307
Maybe!

12:49.867 --> 12:57.209
Yeah, you know, both Kyary-senpai and Sora-senpai sing anime songs now!

12:57.229 --> 12:59.349
So amazing!

12:59.509 --> 13:02.470
We have such amazing senpai FUWAMOCO-chan!

13:04.161 --> 13:04.582
BAU BAU!

13:04.622 --> 13:05.183
Congratulations!

13:15.350 --> 13:16.671
FUWAMOCO!

13:17.131 --> 13:25.937
Well, speaking of Ai-senpai, you know, there's been some exciting new looks being supported by our EN-senpai!

13:26.197 --> 13:32.961
So, and you know, like, the seasons are changing and fashion, fashion kind of changes along with the seasons.

13:33.322 --> 13:38.665
So we thought that, you know, with the beginning of summer here, that we could, like, a bit of a look at them!

13:38.725 --> 13:38.885
Yeah!

13:39.045 --> 13:39.706
Yeah, first,

13:40.106 --> 13:42.707
We have Kiara-senpai!

13:42.867 --> 13:48.170
She has her new, brand new, 80's exercise style outfit!

13:48.550 --> 13:49.590
It's so cute!

13:49.610 --> 13:50.091
Right?

13:50.151 --> 13:51.772
Thanks for waiting!

13:51.792 --> 13:56.874
Yeah, it's got some, uh, breathing holes on the sleeves there.

13:56.894 --> 13:59.195
I sort of have that for my New Year's outfit.

13:59.895 --> 14:00.696
A little bit, right?

14:01.696 --> 14:08.984
You know, maybe it's not quite an 80s thing, but it's always fun to do exercise videos on YouTube, right?

14:09.004 --> 14:11.106
It's sort of the same feel, right?

14:11.266 --> 14:17.933
Yeah, maybe Kiara-senpai, maybe she'll release some cool exercise videos to do together with the KFP!

14:18.013 --> 14:18.474
Yeah!

14:18.494 --> 14:19.034
Right!

14:19.054 --> 14:21.156
Fuwawa-boshi, what?

14:31.448 --> 14:32.569
Excuse me.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.951
I like to be able to focus on my exercising.

14:36.491 --> 14:44.316
And you know, um, if, if I, if I'm a bit exposed then, uh... Where the FUWAMOCO going?!

14:44.356 --> 14:44.496
What?

14:52.840 --> 15:00.023
There's also, Moco-chan, I know, what about Mococo is what you're saying, but what about Kronii-senpai?

15:00.343 --> 15:00.623
Right?

15:00.663 --> 15:10.406
Recently Kronii-senpai also got a new outfit too!

15:11.406 --> 15:14.647
Super cool and controlling commanding Kronii!

15:17.458 --> 15:17.738
BAU BAU!

15:48.559 --> 15:54.782
FUWAMOCO Morning was a big one!

15:55.163 --> 15:59.385
Bae-senpai also got a brand new outfit!

15:59.465 --> 16:02.727
It's a very chuny chaos red sleeve.

16:02.747 --> 16:04.949
She has an eye patch too, Moco-chan!

16:06.727 --> 16:09.128
Yeah, bunnies!

16:09.508 --> 16:14.169
Yeah, but both her and Kronii-senpai kind of look like they could whip you into shape, right?

16:14.189 --> 16:17.330
But, couldn't Kiara-senpai also whip you into shape, too?

16:17.350 --> 16:21.271
I guess... A different kind of whip you into shape, girl!

16:21.351 --> 16:23.331
Yeah, we're gonna whip you into shape, huh?

16:23.351 --> 16:27.252
Yeah, you better listen to what we have to say, huh?

16:27.732 --> 16:31.553
Yeah... What do you think, Ruffians?

16:31.873 --> 16:33.914
If FUWAMOCO is to get new outfits,

16:34.594 --> 16:35.915
What do you think are the best?

16:35.975 --> 16:38.135
Maybe cool outfits like these?

16:38.276 --> 16:39.716
Or do you think they would suit us?

16:39.836 --> 16:42.077
Or wear something more cute and comfy?

16:42.117 --> 16:42.697
Yeah.

16:42.737 --> 16:43.558
That would be better.

16:43.818 --> 16:44.838
Yeah.

16:45.418 --> 16:46.479
Huh?

16:46.959 --> 16:47.959
Sleeves!

16:48.059 --> 16:48.640
Sleeves!

16:48.720 --> 16:49.340
Sleeves!

16:50.180 --> 16:52.121
Do we not have enough sleeves for you now?

16:52.141 --> 16:52.321
Sure, sure!

16:52.741 --> 16:53.502
Bikinis!

16:54.162 --> 16:54.922

16:55.002 --> 16:56.823
What are you two wearing now?

16:56.843 --> 16:58.023
Astronaut outfits!

16:58.324 --> 16:59.744
Like Ame-senpai!

16:59.764 --> 17:00.444
So cute!

17:00.524 --> 17:01.745

17:49.928 --> 17:54.230
Fluffy and fuzzy pajamas for the fluffy and fuzzy ones, you know?

17:54.250 --> 17:55.030
It's always good.

17:59.672 --> 18:10.138
Ruffians, maybe you know you've been a little bit busy and haven't really noticed, but FUWAMOCO, we've been undergoing some very serious training.

18:10.238 --> 18:10.558
Yeah.

18:11.570 --> 18:12.170
Training.

18:12.870 --> 18:14.291
In Minecraft!

18:15.631 --> 18:16.371
Yeah!

18:16.772 --> 18:21.053
You know, it might be hard to believe, but... FUWAMOCO!

18:21.073 --> 18:24.094
We really don't know much about Minecraft.

18:24.114 --> 18:28.355
We don't really have had any experience with it until we joined hololive.

18:28.375 --> 18:28.915
Right!

18:31.036 --> 18:31.776
No experience.

18:32.369 --> 18:33.189
We never played it.

18:33.289 --> 18:33.530
No.

18:33.970 --> 18:36.931
So, now we're trying our best to learn the basics.

18:36.951 --> 18:37.431
Yeah!

18:37.811 --> 18:42.253
Along with your very much appreciated help, obviously.

18:42.373 --> 18:43.314
Unnecessary help.

18:43.374 --> 18:43.894
Yeah.

18:44.194 --> 18:47.856
You know, and so far we've learned how to survive night time.

18:47.956 --> 18:49.196
Night time was very scary.

18:49.236 --> 18:49.416
Yeah.

18:51.418 --> 18:55.764
I made a bazillion stone pickaxes all at once.

18:56.225 --> 18:57.326
And we caught sheep.

18:57.927 --> 19:03.234
And finally, we're starting to be able to make and eat food.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.778
Amongst a bunch of other things.

19:08.461 --> 19:09.821
It's a very comfy time.

19:09.861 --> 19:12.042
You know, we're dual streaming it.

19:12.102 --> 19:15.884
So that means it's Fuwawa POV and my POV.

19:15.985 --> 19:16.845
Yeah.

19:17.145 --> 19:23.308
So you know, you can check maybe Moco-chan out as she minds and Fuwawa as I make food.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.030
I'm still not sure how food works though.

19:26.430 --> 19:29.652
Cause Moco-chan, your tummy killed you, right?

19:30.092 --> 19:31.033
I think so, yeah.

19:31.413 --> 19:33.274
I thought someone was shooting at me, but no.

19:33.934 --> 19:35.135
I don't know how it works.

19:35.195 --> 19:37.637
Why does it have two food bars?

19:40.300 --> 19:41.641
You just eat it, that's all.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.262
We'll have to find out next time.

19:43.663 --> 19:52.451
But because we're both streaming at the same time, you can hear both of us in the background, we can chat amongst each other.

19:52.471 --> 19:57.335
I think it makes a kind of a unique experience, a bit of a different kind of Minecraft.

20:00.396 --> 20:01.416
Ruffians, but!

20:01.476 --> 20:05.960
We're gonna be doing our best to continue our training weekly!

20:06.120 --> 20:11.085
So please join us this weekend for a nice, relaxing... Yeah.

20:11.805 --> 20:13.146
Just Minecraft time together.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.728
Minecraft time teaches common sense.

20:15.288 --> 20:16.450
Please, please.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.992
Okay, backseating is okay, okay.

20:19.032 --> 20:21.555
Please, please help, okay.

20:21.635 --> 20:22.657
BAU BAU!

20:24.318 --> 20:28.103
Yeah, it's a big learning experience, yeah.

20:28.643 --> 20:30.986
Thank you for all the help, Ruffians!

20:31.066 --> 20:31.547
Thank you!

20:33.729 --> 20:36.091
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.292
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

20:37.312 --> 20:39.534
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

20:39.554 --> 20:40.515
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

20:41.395 --> 20:44.077
BAU BAU!

20:44.658 --> 20:53.625
Well, as I said, you know, Ruffians, right now, it's the summer of Advent within the year of FUWAMOCO!

20:54.506 --> 20:59.930
You know, that means that FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be zooming around!

20:59.990 --> 21:02.152
You know, not only have zoomies,

21:03.260 --> 21:04.341
This summer time, yeah.

21:07.584 --> 21:10.026
Tired and slow zoomies.

21:10.587 --> 21:22.538
But not only will we just be at New York City for the hololive English second month of Breaking Dimensions, but we'll also be in Australia for Smash!

21:28.850 --> 21:28.930
Bye!

21:28.991 --> 21:31.941
Are we gonna be playing Minecraft in Australia?

21:32.002 --> 21:34.290
No, we're not playing Minecraft in Australia!

21:36.462 --> 21:38.003
That would be exciting though.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.566
I'm sure there's a lot of things like creepers and fuzzy mistakes.

21:41.746 --> 21:45.029
You know those kind of Minecraft enemies, the purple guy?

21:45.549 --> 21:47.451
Probably in Australia too, right?

21:47.471 --> 21:48.632
That makes sense.

21:48.672 --> 21:49.032
Yeah.

21:49.373 --> 21:53.116
But it'll be our first time down under high!

21:53.156 --> 21:53.836
Yeah!

21:54.157 --> 21:55.918
We're working hard to prepare for it.

21:56.699 --> 21:57.419
Right now!

21:57.920 --> 22:00.322
Through Smash's SNS, you can send them a question.

22:00.822 --> 22:03.524
You'd like to have us answer at the event too?

22:03.824 --> 22:04.285
Yeah.

22:04.625 --> 22:11.571
Alright, so if there's any Ruffians planning on going, please send Smash your questions and we'll answer them there for you.

22:11.991 --> 22:15.314
And you know, maybe there's some silly Ruffians out there.

22:15.714 --> 22:20.358
You might ask a question too, but you won't be at the event.

22:21.419 --> 22:22.139
Ruffians!

22:22.400 --> 22:27.303
Do you know what you can do to get your question answered even if you won't be going to Australia?

22:30.122 --> 22:34.144
You know, right?

22:34.264 --> 22:36.425
Oh my gosh, I don't think they know, Moco-chan.

22:36.445 --> 22:37.546
We say it every time.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.907
We say it every time, Ruffians!

22:41.428 --> 22:42.068
Yeah!

22:42.408 --> 22:45.070
Hashtag hashtag FWMCMORNING!

22:50.410 --> 22:53.176
Okay, Ruffians, no pouting, okay?

22:53.236 --> 22:55.440
I think you're distracted by the hashtag hashtag!

22:55.781 --> 22:57.484
They don't know what the hashtag is for!

22:57.544 --> 22:59.769
Moco-chan, you gotta cut that out then, okay?

23:03.951 --> 23:08.994
And also, the lottery for our meet and greet tickets will be opening soon, okay?

23:09.014 --> 23:14.877
They'll be opening at 8am Australia time on the 20th this month.

23:15.377 --> 23:21.541
So any Australian Ruffians who'd like to chat with us, please mark it into your calendars, okay?

23:21.561 --> 23:25.163
8am, bright and early, down under.

23:25.883 --> 23:32.024
You know, we think we'll be able to talk with more Ruffians this time compared to our first meet-and-greet in Taipei.

23:32.244 --> 23:32.504
Right!

23:32.524 --> 23:39.725
We're so excited to talk to you face-to-face, Ruffians!

23:40.245 --> 23:42.626
Please show us your biggest smiles, okay?

23:42.666 --> 23:43.286
Got it!

23:43.806 --> 23:46.347
BAU BAU!

23:46.447 --> 23:48.267
We're excited!

23:48.367 --> 23:52.308
It'll definitely be a super fun time.

23:52.328 --> 23:52.408
Yeah.

23:52.968 --> 23:53.388
Wow.

23:55.922 --> 23:57.343
There's some exciting things.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.384
No, it's also not exciting, Ruffians.

24:01.945 --> 24:03.025
When you make a mistake.

24:03.465 --> 24:03.765
Yeah.

24:04.406 --> 24:09.328
And, uh, Fuwawa, uh, I have some bad news.

24:10.948 --> 24:11.369
Yeah?

24:11.929 --> 24:19.352
You know, the other day when we were out with Nerissa, we actually brought some new pajamas together!

24:19.392 --> 24:20.832
Did Nerissa give you pajamas?

24:21.313 --> 24:21.373
No.

24:23.014 --> 24:25.997
FUWAMOCO we bought pajamas.

24:26.477 --> 24:26.957
She was with us.

24:26.978 --> 24:27.898
We counted together.

24:27.998 --> 24:29.680
And she bought pajamas from the same place.

24:31.163 --> 24:34.124
Pajamas are really fluffy and fuzzy and luxurious.

24:57.572 --> 24:58.532
Yeah.

24:58.632 --> 25:03.714
Actually, FUWAMOCO, we'd really like to have a collaboration with them one day.

25:03.734 --> 25:03.814
Yeah!

25:04.114 --> 25:06.115
You know, because we're fluffy and fuzzy.

25:06.915 --> 25:09.116
But, uh... Cute pajamas, you know?

25:09.156 --> 25:09.516
Yeah.

25:09.936 --> 25:11.016
Cuter than this!

25:11.856 --> 25:18.738
But, uh, so the new pajamas, I decided to wear them for the first time this morning.

25:18.758 --> 25:27.141
And you know, Ruffians, whenever you get something that's brand new, you're always very careful not to get it dirty or hurt.

25:27.719 --> 25:29.280
Right!

25:29.300 --> 25:39.006
So, I was very very careful until you know, I got a bit too excited while I was drinking my matcha latte.

25:39.767 --> 25:47.072
And uh, I ended up missing my mouth and accidentally poured it down the front of my pajamas.

25:49.166 --> 25:53.449
I was like, to Moco-chan, Moco-chan, help!

25:53.970 --> 25:55.311
Tissues, tissues!

25:55.411 --> 25:57.372
But we're all out of tissues!

25:57.412 --> 26:00.214
There was a lot of latte everywhere!

26:00.514 --> 26:03.777
So Moco-chan was just like, take it off, Moco-chan!

26:03.997 --> 26:07.519
So I took it off and I quickly rinsed it with cold water.

26:10.061 --> 26:12.743
I think I got a lot of the matcha off, but...

26:13.632 --> 26:16.874
We'll see how it is after it's done with the wash.

26:16.934 --> 26:17.314
Yeah.

26:17.754 --> 26:18.335
Yeah.

26:18.515 --> 26:22.137
It was a really horrible steam bath, Moco-chan.

26:22.317 --> 26:22.997
It was bad.

26:23.698 --> 26:29.201
But luckily we have steam remover because I... This is not a rare occurrence.

26:30.662 --> 26:31.082
Yeah.

26:32.243 --> 26:35.224
I accidentally... What?

26:36.365 --> 26:41.288
I accidentally sprayed something on Moco-chan the other day which stained your shirt.

26:42.068 --> 26:42.549
Yeah.

26:43.439 --> 26:43.599
Yeah.

26:43.920 --> 26:44.360
Yeah.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.101
It just happened.

26:45.121 --> 26:45.402
But, uh, yeah.

26:57.145 --> 26:57.625
I don't know.

26:57.685 --> 26:59.165
I can't believe I was that clumsy.

26:59.205 --> 27:00.286
I just missed my mouth.

27:00.326 --> 27:00.546
Again.

27:01.726 --> 27:09.248
But my mouth tattoo... If it's no good, we'll just have to hope that we can get some more cute pajamas soon.

27:09.268 --> 27:10.348
Right, Moco-chan?

27:10.688 --> 27:11.328
Hopefully.

27:12.188 --> 27:13.108
Hopefully.

27:13.128 --> 27:16.489
BAU BAU!

27:16.989 --> 27:19.690
Yeah, I'm gonna try not to miss my mouth again.

27:19.710 --> 27:21.010
Do your best.

27:21.330 --> 27:21.830
Yeah.

27:23.191 --> 27:24.531
Well, Ruffians!

27:26.717 --> 27:31.140
And that means today we get to see another Doggie of the Day!

27:31.160 --> 27:32.621
Does it have to do with the end of the week?

27:33.182 --> 27:35.623
I don't know, I just know Doggie of the Day, Doggie of the Day.

27:36.144 --> 27:38.025
I'm excited for the Doggie of the Day.

27:38.045 --> 27:38.085
Hi!

27:38.185 --> 27:41.107
This is the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan!

27:41.988 --> 27:44.590
We have a de-den!

27:44.850 --> 27:45.451
Akami!

27:46.271 --> 27:48.133
Alchemy!

27:48.173 --> 27:49.614
Really fitting name, huh?

27:49.654 --> 27:50.215
Right!

27:50.235 --> 27:52.236
Look at the powerful eyes and- Right!

27:52.637 --> 27:53.758
Is that a coffee cup?

27:53.818 --> 27:55.419
I think so, you know.

27:55.779 --> 27:56.980
Cuz you know Alchemy!

27:57.340 --> 27:59.722
Alchemy is a wolf hybrid!

27:59.742 --> 27:59.802
Huh!

28:00.283 --> 28:02.945
Actually, doggy looks wow, really cool, right?

28:03.145 --> 28:04.046
Really cool!

28:04.066 --> 28:05.727
Just a big goofball!

28:06.068 --> 28:06.968
Love his, like, eyes.

28:07.669 --> 28:08.450
Looks cool!

28:08.950 --> 28:10.051
Big goofball, huh?

28:10.451 --> 28:13.314
I don't know if we have the looks cool part down, but...

28:14.094 --> 28:16.237
I don't exactly like Alchemy, no.

28:16.257 --> 28:27.349
Alchemy also likes to have fun and cuddle, and as seen here, likes to collect objects while on walks.

28:27.490 --> 28:32.075
You know, maybe Alchemy is going to use them for us.

28:34.569 --> 28:34.869
Maybe.

28:34.909 --> 28:37.011
Don't know what's in the cup.

28:37.131 --> 28:37.591
Right.

28:37.831 --> 28:40.573
Don't know what's in the cup.

28:40.914 --> 28:43.776
How does Alchemy BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

28:45.077 --> 28:47.619
Alchemy looks cool, but... But?

28:47.939 --> 28:51.442
I think the BAU BAU is like... BAU BAU!

28:51.502 --> 28:52.463
BAU BAU!

28:52.483 --> 28:52.723
Really?

28:52.803 --> 28:53.544
BAU BAU!

28:53.924 --> 28:54.745
I disagree.

28:54.785 --> 28:56.686
It's like... BAU BAU!

28:57.727 --> 28:58.368
BAU BAU!

28:58.388 --> 28:59.448
Like that.

28:59.588 --> 29:00.189
Really?

29:00.309 --> 29:00.990
Yeah!

29:01.070 --> 29:01.230
No.

29:02.355 --> 29:04.358
You disagree, right, Ruffians?

29:05.599 --> 29:06.640
BAU BAU!

29:10.325 --> 29:11.246
Why?

29:11.406 --> 29:15.291
Alchemy looks wise as the name suggests, you know?

29:15.391 --> 29:15.712
But...

29:18.061 --> 29:21.105
Pretty silly, just like FUWAMOCO!

29:21.145 --> 29:21.626
Right?

29:23.148 --> 29:25.911
It must be nice looking all serious though.

29:26.251 --> 29:29.556
You know, if Akuma goes extreme violence, you're gonna run away.

29:29.576 --> 29:29.616
Hi!

29:30.957 --> 29:31.738
Just like us, too!

29:31.758 --> 29:31.798
Hi!

29:31.839 --> 29:31.899
Hi!

29:35.114 --> 29:36.694
BAU BAU!

29:38.235 --> 29:40.215
BAU BAU!

29:40.235 --> 29:44.216
How come he's so cool?

29:44.236 --> 29:45.837
I'm cool, though.

29:46.457 --> 29:47.497
BAU BAU!

29:48.997 --> 29:50.718
And next, Ruffians!

29:50.798 --> 29:53.579
Show us where you've been going on a walk, huh?

29:54.159 --> 29:54.859
Let's take a walk!

29:55.828 --> 29:58.351
We have de-den!

29:59.052 --> 29:59.353
What?

29:59.493 --> 29:59.833
What?

29:59.953 --> 30:00.234
What?

30:00.955 --> 30:01.455
Oh!

30:01.475 --> 30:02.777
A boulder field!

30:02.797 --> 30:03.919
A boulder field!

30:03.959 --> 30:05.761
A camping trip!

30:05.781 --> 30:07.984
So when someone is like, I want a boulder!

30:08.805 --> 30:09.686
Is this where they go?

30:09.706 --> 30:10.567
Get them from?

30:13.240 --> 30:14.300
Like a rock store.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.141
Oh, but a field!

30:16.721 --> 30:20.243
Kind of like a pumpkin field, but with boulders, right?

30:20.283 --> 30:20.963
Right!

30:21.283 --> 30:24.244
They have pebbles a little bit bigger than pebbles.

30:24.264 --> 30:26.385
Bee-boo land!

30:26.465 --> 30:29.106
You went on a camping trip to bee-boo land!

30:29.447 --> 30:30.587
Rock, rock!

30:30.727 --> 30:33.808
This is the pebbles' birthplace!

30:34.469 --> 30:36.229
But this looks so cool!

30:36.529 --> 30:42.472
I'm sure it's really hard to walk across the... Every time you step on the pebbles, it... Bleh!

30:45.025 --> 30:47.627
We're very glad you did what you saw.

30:48.067 --> 30:52.369
And I hope you had an amazing camping trip too.

30:52.529 --> 30:54.851
BAU BAU!

30:55.191 --> 31:01.074
And our Question of the Day we have... De-den!

31:02.115 --> 31:03.816
Good morning, Fuwawa-chan!

31:03.896 --> 31:05.177
Good morning, Moco-chan!

31:05.237 --> 31:06.478
Good morning!

31:06.959 --> 31:16.087
If you were to take out each advent member to a two-on-one or even one-on-one date, where would you take each of them on one date?

31:17.475 --> 31:19.196
I think this is an easy question.

31:19.356 --> 31:20.437
Right, Moco-chan?

31:20.978 --> 31:23.600
There's so many places I want to go with them.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.201
Shiori!

31:25.261 --> 31:28.043
Read to some kind of place that's very unique to Japan.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.905
Maybe somewhere more with subculture.

31:31.445 --> 31:33.287
And more books that she wants.

31:33.687 --> 31:34.208
Yeah.

31:34.508 --> 31:38.551
I think she's been saying she wants to go find more books.

31:38.971 --> 31:40.072
Yeah.

31:40.112 --> 31:42.774
Now there's a lot of places I can think of.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.416
Ah, for Nerissa!

31:44.736 --> 31:47.598
Some place that's like classy and has a meet.

31:48.119 --> 31:48.819
Has a meet.

31:48.939 --> 31:49.460
Yeah.

31:50.040 --> 31:54.123
So some place you know that is kind of like Japan, but classy.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.084
With a meet.

31:55.384 --> 31:55.825
With a meet.

31:56.305 --> 31:56.525
Yeah.

31:57.646 --> 32:00.048
And then, Biboo!

32:00.088 --> 32:02.790
Somewhere maybe more fun, and like, younger, hip.

32:02.850 --> 32:03.331
Hip!

32:04.471 --> 32:08.014
Maybe somewhere that has games, like a theme park or something.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.855
Yeah.

32:09.916 --> 32:13.338
You know, Dagashiya-san.

32:13.518 --> 32:13.879
Right.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.039
That would be fun.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.141
Problem is, it'd be fun with all of them.

32:17.161 --> 32:20.003
Yeah, I'd like to take all of Advent to Dagashiya-san.

32:20.083 --> 32:24.747
Yeah, you know, like a Japanese candy store.

32:24.827 --> 32:25.167
Right?

32:25.227 --> 32:26.108
Sweet store.

32:28.915 --> 32:37.204
There's just so many places and such a long list of things we want to do together with Alvin.

32:38.103 --> 32:41.907
But I don't know if we have enough time this time.

32:41.987 --> 32:45.270
It's tricky trying to get everybody's schedules to line up, you know?

32:45.350 --> 32:45.850
Yeah.

32:45.970 --> 32:50.875
So, you know, we might only be able to do so much together this time.

32:51.335 --> 32:55.299
But we'll treasure the moments that we do have to share together.

32:55.379 --> 32:56.019
Yeah!

32:56.119 --> 32:57.000
BAU BAU!

32:57.080 --> 32:58.962
BAU BAU!

32:59.443 --> 33:00.924
Yeah, so many places.

33:01.184 --> 33:02.725
BAU BAU!

33:02.765 --> 33:06.787
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

33:07.548 --> 33:08.709
Thank you so much!

33:09.089 --> 33:16.813
So, so much for 99 episodes of your submissions of spending all these mornings together.

33:17.154 --> 33:27.820
But Ruffians, I want to remind you, just because we're about to reach 100 episodes doesn't mean you get to stop submitting your doggy of the days, your walks,

33:28.200 --> 33:31.126
Your questions, your pero sightings, okay?

33:31.146 --> 33:32.569
Doesn't mean that you get to stop.

33:34.012 --> 33:38.862
We're always looking for new submissions, so please remember, use the hashtag!

33:40.697 --> 33:43.560
F-W-M-C-MORNING!

33:43.660 --> 33:44.180
Okay.

33:44.381 --> 33:44.481
Yeah.

33:44.541 --> 33:47.324
If you say hashtag, hashtag, they're not gonna focus, right?

33:47.344 --> 33:47.844
No.

33:47.965 --> 33:48.285
Yeah.

33:48.445 --> 33:50.407
BAU BAU!

33:50.487 --> 33:52.269
BAU BAU!

33:52.670 --> 33:56.254
Well, we have a new stream coming up very soon, right, Moco-chan?

33:56.274 --> 33:56.874
Yeah!

33:56.914 --> 33:57.775
Our next stream is...

33:59.215 --> 34:01.476
Mbembe Radio.

34:01.636 --> 34:03.297
Yeah, Mbembe Radio.

34:03.357 --> 34:09.679
It's a horror adventure game where, you know, we kind of explore things on the way back home from school.

34:10.139 --> 34:12.760
And then we kind of notice some strange occurrences happening.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.541
I have no clue about it.

34:15.741 --> 34:17.362
It's something sort of obscure and there's an Mbembe Radio!

34:17.382 --> 34:18.982
Mbembe... What's an Mbembe?

34:19.002 --> 34:19.362
BAU BAU!

34:47.875 --> 34:55.222
And then, on Sunday, we're gonna be having a watch-along of "Hachi: a Dog's Tale" together with our Doggy Pack!

34:56.664 --> 34:57.685
I'm looking forward to it.

34:57.725 --> 35:00.147
Just a nice time watching a movie all together.

35:00.167 --> 35:05.011
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

35:05.392 --> 35:11.937
And for any Ruffians who are joining us through the archives today, here is your FUWAMOCODE word!
