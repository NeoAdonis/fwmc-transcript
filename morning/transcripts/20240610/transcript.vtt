00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.731
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:13.036
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:15.378
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:15.818
BAU BAU!

00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:17.139
Ruffians!

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.181
BAU BAU!

00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:19.842
Good Morning!

00:05:27.288 --> 00:05:30.249
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.910
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.791
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.471
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:43.013
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.933
Thank you Ruffians!

00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:49.895
Thank you for joining us today for our 97th episode!

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:53.156
Congratulations on waking up early today!

00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:55.517
Ruffians, you did it!

00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.919
BAU BAU!

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.901
And just like that, we're gonna start a new week.

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:04.282
A big week.

00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:07.083
Altogether!

00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:09.384
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:11.525
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:17.748
I definitely see maybe some new Ruffians with us today.

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:19.349
Not a lot of Ruffians.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.992
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:25.152
What is this show?

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.694
So, to explain for you!

00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:28.795
Right there!

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:33.357
Who are maybe joining us for the first time, or maybe the 97th time.

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:39.961
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.282
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:45.384
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:49.667
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start

00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:51.889
Start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.413
Tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:56.614 --> 00:06:59.897
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:00.357
BAU BAU!

00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:13.323
Hashtag hashtag is back.

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:14.864
Hashtag hashtag hashtag.

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:16.564
Moco-chan's not saying that.

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:19.064
It's nice to celebrate all the small things, huh?

00:07:19.444 --> 00:07:20.725
All the small things.

00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:22.865
No matter how small they are.

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:24.205
They matter to you.

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:24.686
Yes!

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.746
If they matter to you, then they matter enough.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:30.367
Yeah.

00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:31.627
BAU hashbrown hashbrown.

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.807
Is that your breakfast today?

00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:36.068
Two hashbrowns.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.065
Well, you know, FUWAMOCO Morning, there's a lot of official breakfasts for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.046
Natto being one of them.

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.348
We can make hashbrowns one of them, too.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.751
Hashbrown, hashbrown, FWMCMorning.

00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:53.433
Who yelled out to me?

00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:57.396
Moco-chan, are you ready for natto today?

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:04.182
BAU BAU.

00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:04.362
BAU BAU!

00:08:05.314 --> 00:08:07.575
BAU BAU!

00:08:10.337 --> 00:08:16.060
But... Sadly enough... Sadly, today is a really happy day.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.181
It's the start of the week.

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:19.542
I'm in a form of good morning.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.564
First time in a little while here.

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:25.586
Well... There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:29.509
Haven't been able to escape that yet, no.

00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:32.891
Well...

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.681
Let's take a look.

00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:35.562
Okay.

00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:39.025
Where was Pero seen this time?

00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:39.866
De-den!

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:45.275
That looks pretty nice.

00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:46.015
Yeah.

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:46.515
What?

00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:52.919
I don't know, it's been such a long time since we saw Pero, but... I don't know, he's looking a little bit different.

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:54.399
Pretty good here, right?

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:55.140
Pretty good.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.961
Right, he looks cute.

00:08:57.021 --> 00:08:57.761
Cute Pero.

00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:00.202
I don't know if I'd go that far, Ruffians.

00:09:00.222 --> 00:09:01.183
That's pretty far.

00:09:01.563 --> 00:09:03.544
That looks... I don't know.

00:09:04.264 --> 00:09:04.805
Fluffy?

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:05.506
Really?

00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:11.516
Maybe have a bit of a fluffy time while we're... We FUWAMOCO, we're working like dogs!

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.077
Huh?

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.319
Yeah...

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:16.522
Filters working one more time.

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:17.963
Probably.

00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:19.184
Wow.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:25.307
You know, it seems that Pero was spotted on the off-kai, an event that happened recently in the US.

00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:25.927
Yeah!

00:09:25.947 --> 00:09:29.489
And Biboo and some of my senpai were guests there, right?

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:30.150
Right.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.170
Nice.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.131
Where did Pero get to go, huh?

00:09:33.251 --> 00:09:33.772
Right.

00:09:36.696 --> 00:09:37.496
Interesting.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.498
It's good that Pero left Biboo alone.

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:43.539
We would've heard from Biboo for sure.

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:45.900
I saw that nasty dog.

00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.581
That's what Biboo would say.

00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:48.622
Ruffians!

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:53.424
Why are you calling him a punctual and polite pupper?

00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:55.545
He's Pero.

00:09:55.945 --> 00:09:56.726
Pero?

00:09:57.186 --> 00:09:58.086
He's not polite.

00:09:58.607 --> 00:10:00.908
He's nasty, Ruffians!

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:02.068
Yeah.

00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:03.649
Not polite.

00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:05.239
Yeah, I don't know.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:12.069
Like, here the filters are working, the lighting is good, you know?

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:12.910
Maybe.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.035
Seems a little fluffy, a little happy, you know?

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:19.460
Maybe because you're gonna give him some blonde rings.

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:22.181
Not the same as Pudding.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.982
Not the same as Pudding, but it's definitely never had any pon-de-ring.

00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:28.923
Why would we give him some hugs?

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:31.444
Why would we give him some hugs?

00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:33.724
I guess that was nice of you, Ruffians.

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.225
Don't be mean to Pero!

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:38.325
You would understand, okay?

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:40.286
You would understand.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.315
But I guess that explains everything, why he looks so fluffy.

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:45.875
Yeah.

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:52.503
Yeah, you know, and I guess he was probably happy to see a bunch of Ruffians at the event.

00:10:52.543 --> 00:10:55.948
You know, he could use you as his advantage.

00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:56.328
Yes.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.469
Gotta be safe here.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:57.690
Yeah.

00:11:01.826 --> 00:11:02.226
But look!

00:11:02.366 --> 00:11:02.787
You know what?

00:11:02.807 --> 00:11:04.708
Those pon-de-rings on the left there.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:05.249
The left!

00:11:05.609 --> 00:11:07.290
They look extra cute, right?

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.511
Why a little different?

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:10.793
Maybe not so delicious, but a little more fluffy.

00:11:10.813 --> 00:11:12.455
A little more pon-de-ring-plushy?

00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:13.175
Yeah!

00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:15.297
Too cute!

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:17.438
Mine's cuter than Pero-hai.

00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:18.860
Yeah, I want them now!

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:21.682
Yay!

00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:25.145
We hope you had a bunch of fun at all caramel fields!

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:25.585
Yes!

00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:28.167
BAU BAU!

00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:32.550
So cute and the dogs chewed everything!

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.272
Thank you.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.094
BAU BAU!

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:39.856
I'm glad you had a bunch of fun!

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:41.117
Yes!

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:44.139
We need to hear more from Biboo, huh?

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:44.240
Yeah!

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.922
We saw a bunch of photos on Twitter, right?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:47.582
Yeah.

00:11:48.243 --> 00:11:48.363
Wow.

00:11:50.466 --> 00:11:52.268
BAU BAU!

00:11:52.288 --> 00:11:54.349
Ruffians!

00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:58.512
You know today's our 97th episode!

00:11:58.912 --> 00:12:03.215
And it also marks the day that FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:04.295
BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:07.857
Thank you for waiting, Ruffians!

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:17.763
I think it was a bit surprising for all of us, but you know, FUWAMOCO Morning had to take a bit of an unexpected break there for a little bit.

00:12:17.783 --> 00:12:20.844
A little bit of off-air time.

00:12:21.205 --> 00:12:29.189
Yeah, it wasn't our plans at all, but there were some sudden changes in our schedule, and they were out of my paws.

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:30.209
Out of my paws!

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.134
We had to take a little break from streaming entirely for a little bit.

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:36.915
It's been busy.

00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:44.080
You know, we BAU BAU'd a bunch about it, but there was just, you know, nothing we could do about it.

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:48.424
We're sorry for making you wait, Ruffians!

00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:51.126
We know it was super rough.

00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:53.028
It was rough for us too.

00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:53.869
No fun.

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:55.090
I guess we missed you.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.921
I miss you Ruffians.

00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:04.524
But now, we're back!

00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:09.688
And we're approaching our 100th episode very soon!

00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:11.489
Very soon!

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:15.372
So 97th episode, Wednesday will be the 98th.

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:16.693
Friday the 99th.

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:24.058
And a week from now, Monday, it's going to be the big day!

00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:27.100
You know, a week from now is really not long.

00:13:28.688 --> 00:13:29.548
Exciting!

00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:32.650
You sleep once and it'll be next week, okay?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.131
The math checks out.

00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:41.655
But Moco-chan, now your barker is barking all fuzzy in a good way again.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:43.516
More or less, right?

00:13:44.037 --> 00:13:44.357
Right?

00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:45.178
FUWAMO makes it a...

00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:49.316
Recently, there's been some especially late nights for us recently.

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:51.337
One's that FUWAMOCO didn't

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:12.929
BAU BAU!

00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:13.269
BAU BAU!

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:13.529
BAU BAU!

00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:38.556
But we're looking forward to many many more FUWAMOCO Mornings with you!

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:41.996
To celebrating our 100th episode!

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:45.557
The first year anniversary of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:46.037 --> 00:14:49.338
And many more special moments!

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:53.338
BAU BAU!

00:14:54.318 --> 00:14:55.779
I forgot about that.

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:59.959
It won't only be the 100th episode, it'll be the first anniversary soon.

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:00.199
Scary!

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:12.387
I still very very much remember the first FUWAMOCO Morning, the zero episode, the part.

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:14.929
Very scary.

00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:19.513
I don't think it's been a year, but it has been a year.

00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:21.174
Wow, frightening.

00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:24.657
BAU BAU!

00:15:24.877 --> 00:15:25.277
But!

00:15:25.478 --> 00:15:25.818
What?

00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:31.287
Wow, we have all those exciting things coming up, but Ruffians!

00:15:31.928 --> 00:15:36.952
We also just recently hit a huge milestone!

00:15:37.372 --> 00:15:43.858
FUWAMOCO, we just reached our second cover song with over 1 million views!

00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:46.741
BAU BAU!

00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:49.303
It is Kyutono Kanojo!

00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:50.024
BAU BAU!

00:15:50.104 --> 00:15:50.925
Thank you!

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:54.066
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:15:54.126 --> 00:15:59.229
Thank you for listening to over and over and over and lots and lots.

00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:04.252
It definitely reminds you of the demon dogs in us, right?

00:16:04.392 --> 00:16:06.653
Oh, FUWAMOCO, you know FUWAMOCO's favorite person?

00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:07.093
They're dogs.

00:16:07.214 --> 00:16:07.454
No!

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.515
We are demon dogs.

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.115
Thank you.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.416
Oh my god, dogs.

00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:12.216
Demon dogs.

00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:13.917
Yeah.

00:16:14.698 --> 00:16:16.899
We hope that you'll continue listening to our music.

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:17.899
Watch to it!

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:20.381
It makes us really happy, Ruffians.

00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:22.022
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:16:22.102 --> 00:16:22.242
Also!

00:16:22.262 --> 00:16:23.663
Not just that, that's a big milestone!

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:52.845
Just within the past few hours, we also reached over 850,000 YouTube subscribers!

00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:53.826
850,000 Ruffians, right!

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.047
BAU BAU!

00:16:55.067 --> 00:17:01.292
Such a big milestone!

00:17:01.372 --> 00:17:03.493
BAU BAU!

00:17:03.633 --> 00:17:06.495
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:07.296
Thank you!

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:13.541
Now we're getting closer and closer to our goal of 1 million subscribers on YouTube here!

00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:15.121
Why?

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.842
What happened if it became 1-2-1-9?

00:17:18.322 --> 00:17:18.702
Right!

00:17:18.762 --> 00:17:20.603
That's how the math works, right!

00:17:20.683 --> 00:17:21.423
Somehow!

00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:23.363
I don't know!

00:17:23.383 --> 00:17:26.164
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:17:26.184 --> 00:17:29.084
We'll continue to have a bunch of fun together with you!

00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:35.826
Protect your smile, and then, you know, one day, maybe we'll make that big dream of ours come true!

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:37.787
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:38.587
BAU BAU!

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.640
It's a good idea!

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.240
Very good idea!

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.881
The best way!

00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:01.549
Send a FUWAMOCO clip to them, your favorite one.

00:18:01.869 --> 00:18:03.971
Moco-chan, do you have a recommendation?

00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.493
The one from Minecraft.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:06.994
Is there only one from Minecraft?

00:18:07.114 --> 00:18:07.535
One of them.

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:07.755
Like?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.235
The one that...

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.501
That one.

00:18:21.381 --> 00:18:21.821
Okay.

00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:26.444
Do you know which one I'm talking about?

00:18:26.464 --> 00:18:27.024
The no one.

00:18:27.184 --> 00:18:28.105
The no one.

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:29.486
That one's good too.

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:30.306
The pickaxe one.

00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:31.327
That one's good too.

00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:32.547
Yeah.

00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:36.169
Do you know which one that one is?

00:18:36.189 --> 00:18:37.870
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.032
Could be any stream.

00:18:42.092 --> 00:18:43.233
It could be any stream.

00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:44.053
Hi.

00:18:44.073 --> 00:18:44.374
Yeah.

00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:50.730
Mama!

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:57.833
Wow, Ruffians, we continue to go forward towards our big goals and dreams.

00:18:57.973 --> 00:18:58.234
But!

00:18:58.674 --> 00:19:03.357
Somehow, we're also already halfway through the year.

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:04.438
Yeah.

00:19:05.258 --> 00:19:05.979
It's June!

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:07.780
June, not July.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.102
And... Did you know that it's June?

00:19:12.523 --> 00:19:12.803
Huh?

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.382
It's a summer time-ish, but it also means...

00:19:22.677 --> 00:19:23.418
Weddings!

00:19:23.678 --> 00:19:24.499
Weddings!

00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:25.400
And parties!

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:47.621
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:19:48.701 --> 00:19:50.522
BAU BAU!

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:51.842
You know what?

00:19:51.862 --> 00:19:59.504
This time it's a bit different compared to our previous voice packs because we recorded it together!

00:19:59.764 --> 00:20:00.324
Together!

00:20:00.724 --> 00:20:03.565
Both FUWAMOCO and surprise!

00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:04.885
Twin FUWAMOCO boys!

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:05.585
Together!

00:20:05.645 --> 00:20:06.265
Ruffians!

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:07.605
In one voice pack!

00:20:07.786 --> 00:20:08.646
Yeah!

00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:15.268
It's the first time that, you know, we've ever released a voice pack quite like this before.

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:19.851
Up until now it's been a Fuwawa voice pack, Mococo voice pack.

00:20:20.231 --> 00:20:25.093
Yeah, but we've heard a lot of things from you, Ruffians.

00:20:25.753 --> 00:20:27.054
Yeah.

00:20:27.854 --> 00:20:30.415
I'm glad you like it so much.

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.356
Yeah, a lot of things.

00:20:32.997 --> 00:20:35.598
Might kinda make you curious, Ruffians.

00:20:36.878 --> 00:20:37.619
Curious?

00:20:39.102 --> 00:20:42.165
Please go check it out on the official hololive shop.

00:20:42.185 --> 00:20:44.007
There's a one minute sample.

00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:45.429
That's pretty long.

00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:48.071
Kind of embarrassing.

00:20:49.953 --> 00:20:52.216
It's pretty long and kind of embarrassing.

00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:52.936
Go check it out.

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:56.480
You're blushing so... I was blushing so hard too, okay?

00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:57.301
Yeah.

00:20:57.721 --> 00:21:00.424
And if you go and check out the sample, I think you might blush too.

00:21:00.484 --> 00:21:00.544
So...

00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:03.827
Go take a listen!

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:09.369
Okay, we have it in both English and Japanese in our Special Voices Tour.

00:21:09.729 --> 00:21:15.631
Please check it out, you know, especially if you maybe kind of wonder what it would be like to get married to twins.

00:21:15.651 --> 00:21:20.153
BAU BAU!

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:23.415
BAU BAU!

00:21:24.095 --> 00:21:27.376
Yeah, and now you can remember, okay, it's June, not July.

00:21:27.456 --> 00:21:29.277
June Pride, not July Pride.

00:21:29.317 --> 00:21:29.817
Makes sense.

00:21:29.877 --> 00:21:31.318
Going away for July, huh?

00:21:31.818 --> 00:21:33.299
But, June.

00:21:33.399 --> 00:21:35.199
Moco-chan, you said it's kind of summer.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.220
Kind of summer.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.780
No, it is summer.

00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:39.921
Because, Ruffians.

00:21:40.782 --> 00:21:47.645
Recently, there have been so many exciting things going on in hololive English.

00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:48.665
These are a lot of them.

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:50.286
hololive English Summer.

00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:53.787
Have you been able to keep up with them so far, Ruffians?

00:21:54.407 --> 00:21:55.068
Yeah.

00:21:55.768 --> 00:21:57.829
What are you looking forward to most right now, huh?

00:22:02.284 --> 00:22:14.338
I see some Ruffians here that are making a little bit of confused faces.

00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:28.272
Well first, just a few days ago during our content writing collab with all of Advent, we announced the official start to the Summer of Advent!

00:22:30.848 --> 00:22:36.831
It's summer of advent in the year of FUWAMOCO!

00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:39.412
It's summer!

00:22:39.892 --> 00:22:40.172
Advent!

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:47.815
And a big first point of this exciting summer is an apparel collab together with OMOCAT!

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:50.557
Advent!

00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:52.780
BAU BAU!

00:22:52.840 --> 00:23:02.169
Yeah, OMOCAT, they released a really really cool, super cool apparel and went for a myth and council before, so now we know.

00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:05.992
We're really happy to be a part of the OMOCAT apparel family!

00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:08.215
Advent, yeah, we're cool too.

00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:09.875
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:23:31.861 --> 00:23:33.883
So you have to look forward to it.

00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:38.946
There will be more designs, more info, and more excitement coming up very soon!

00:23:39.547 --> 00:23:42.809
So please keep your eyes open for it, okay?

00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:46.832
You can also check out the Summer of Advent website for more information.

00:23:46.852 --> 00:23:50.415
That way you don't get lost on all the exciting things.

00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:56.299
We enjoy our super hot, super fun Advent Summer!

00:23:56.479 --> 00:23:57.400
BAU BAU!

00:23:58.182 --> 00:24:00.367
My eyes are peeled!

00:24:00.788 --> 00:24:01.510
Thank you!

00:24:01.951 --> 00:24:03.856
Make sure you put sunscreen on them too.

00:24:04.096 --> 00:24:04.918
Maybe, just maybe.

00:24:05.893 --> 00:24:06.554
Come on, Advent.

00:24:06.574 --> 00:24:07.695
Advent of Summer.

00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:09.297
But!

00:24:09.317 --> 00:24:09.377
But!

00:24:09.757 --> 00:24:10.078
But!

00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:13.081
Most excitingly, Ruffians!

00:24:14.082 --> 00:24:15.123
Ruffians!

00:24:15.203 --> 00:24:16.505
It's happening!

00:24:16.845 --> 00:24:18.126
Advent!

00:24:18.307 --> 00:24:19.948
Come on!

00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:25.755
We all announced that we'll be having our 3D debuts this summer!

00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:26.155
How?

00:24:29.736 --> 00:24:32.818
We are so extremely excited!

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:34.719
You're ready, I'm not ready.

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:38.562
I'm ready but not ready but I'm ready!

00:24:38.642 --> 00:24:43.185
Yeah, we're practicing and preparing like crazy right now, Ruffians!

00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:45.767
3D.

00:24:46.107 --> 00:24:46.487
Yeah.

00:24:46.707 --> 00:24:47.688
The BAU BAU in 3D.

00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:47.968
Right!

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.112
Wow, the fluff and fuzz in full 3D!

00:24:53.152 --> 00:24:54.113
Yeah!

00:24:54.413 --> 00:24:59.756
But I think we're even more nervous for this now than I did a year ago.

00:25:00.336 --> 00:25:01.597
Yeah.

00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:02.598
Yeah.

00:25:02.818 --> 00:25:03.378
Nervous.

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:04.599
But excited!

00:25:04.999 --> 00:25:05.820
But nervous.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:17.195
But you know, we'll finally be able to show you our fluffy and fuzzy selves and do so many fun things that we always dreamed of doing with you, Ruffians!

00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:24.038
Please look forward to it, but not too much, but please look forward to it!

00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:32.922
And if you could also cheer for Advent lots and lots as, you know, we keep working like dogs toward our big baby days.

00:25:33.123 --> 00:25:36.024
We're all working really, really hard and we're looking

00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:40.087
For everyone's daily daily assignments too!

00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:41.307
But!

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:41.968
But?

00:25:42.548 --> 00:25:43.329
But!

00:25:43.469 --> 00:25:43.729
But!

00:25:43.769 --> 00:25:46.071
That's not all, Ruffians!

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.231
Huh?

00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:47.392
Huh?

00:25:47.452 --> 00:25:49.333
hololive Idia!

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:50.654
No.

00:25:50.694 --> 00:25:54.636
We just announced our second concert!

00:25:54.836 --> 00:25:57.558
Breaking Dimensions!

00:25:57.778 --> 00:25:58.219
BAU!

00:25:58.779 --> 00:25:59.259
BAU!

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500
The Broken!

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.321
BAU BAU!

00:26:02.902 --> 00:26:05.025
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:05.345 --> 00:26:10.251
We're gonna be making our 3D stage debut very soon!

00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:11.773
I'm so excited.

00:26:11.793 --> 00:26:14.596
I don't think that I...

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.160
Moco-chan.

00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:20.101
Breaking Dimensions.

00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:20.801
It's... Two days.

00:26:21.001 --> 00:26:21.121
Huh?

00:26:21.221 --> 00:26:21.281
Yes.

00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:21.702
Two days.

00:26:45.883 --> 00:26:47.846
It's two days!

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:48.647
Not tomorrow.

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:50.148
Two days!

00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:50.889
Not one day.

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:51.590
Two days!

00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.311
Yeah!

00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:53.192
It's not tomorrow.

00:26:53.813 --> 00:26:55.275
It's August 24th and 25th.

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:55.555
Yeah!

00:27:01.562 --> 00:27:02.883
Two days, Ruffians!

00:27:02.983 --> 00:27:03.243
Two days!

00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:05.025
And right now, Ruffians!

00:27:05.385 --> 00:27:10.109
You can get your streaming tickets on SPWS on Spawn!

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:12.230
So please check them out!

00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.834
And see, you can also get your exclusive merch sets right now as well!

00:27:16.854 --> 00:27:20.177
The order period is rather short and it ends within a few weeks.

00:27:20.537 --> 00:27:22.579
So please don't forget, okay, Ruffians?

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.360
This way you can get your merch before

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.101
Right where your cool t-shirt have your cool towel.

00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.202
And most importantly that way.

00:27:30.522 --> 00:27:38.325
We can see you waving around those blue and pink ten like us!

00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:42.906
Of course there will also be ticket sales for the venue tickets!

00:27:43.567 --> 00:27:46.528
But they will also be very limited.

00:27:46.608 --> 00:27:49.589
And they're sold on a first come first serve basis.

00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:51.249
Not a lottery system.

00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:52.950
So Ruffians...

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.432
Please do your best in the battle, okay?

00:27:56.512 --> 00:27:58.093
We're cheering for you!

00:27:58.113 --> 00:27:59.254
Do your best, okay?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:33.415
We'll show you just how fluffy and fuzzy we are on the stage of K-Ruffians.

00:28:33.575 --> 00:28:33.856
BAU BAU!

00:28:33.936 --> 00:28:39.659
It's gonna be the best way to end off the summer.

00:28:39.819 --> 00:28:44.782
Just in case you're a bit confused, Breaking Dimensions is not our 3D debut.

00:28:44.882 --> 00:28:46.242
It is not our 3D debut, no.

00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:52.365
We'll be making our 3D debuts here before!

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:53.145
Before, okay.

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.085
Before!

00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:56.986
So don't worry, okay!

00:28:57.586 --> 00:29:00.127
Let's look forward to it, okay!

00:29:00.147 --> 00:29:00.587
Yeah!

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:01.707
Right.

00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:05.369
That means it's gonna be before the 24th, 25th of August.

00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:10.350
Exciting!

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.230
Exciting!

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:11.910
BAU BAU!

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.412
BAU BAU!

00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:16.513
FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:19.595
An exciting new start to the week.

00:29:20.835 --> 00:29:24.677
And sometimes the week can be a little rough even though there's exciting things.

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.939
So that means, Moco-chan!

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:30.841
You're gonna show everybody just how strong you are.

00:29:32.357 --> 00:29:35.078
Challenge yourself to something you're not the best with.

00:29:35.718 --> 00:29:37.699
NANDO!

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.621
BAU BAU!

00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:50.464
Just like all the previous weeks, Moco-chan's gonna challenge herself to overcome her dislike of NANDO.

00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:53.425
When Fuwawa asks me, are you good for it?

00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.689
No!

00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:58.230
Moco-chan's like, can I do it on Friday?

00:29:58.731 --> 00:29:59.051
No!

00:29:59.151 --> 00:30:00.511
That defeats the purpose.

00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.413
The purpose is not for you to try and eat some natto.

00:30:03.753 --> 00:30:06.954
It's for you to challenge yourself at the beginning of the week.

00:30:07.354 --> 00:30:12.216
You know, and so Ruffians, they can do their best to challenge yourself to new things.

00:30:12.817 --> 00:30:13.617
Friday!

00:30:13.717 --> 00:30:14.898
That's kind of late to start.

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:16.058
The week's like almost over.

00:30:16.958 --> 00:30:19.179
I mean, if you're gonna start, it's a good time to start.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.200
Now is always a good time to start.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.881
But, not Friday.

00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:27.592
So Moco-chan is going to do her best to eat natto.

00:30:27.652 --> 00:30:28.372
Natto!

00:30:28.753 --> 00:30:30.774
It's a common breakfast food in Japan.

00:30:30.814 --> 00:30:32.755
It's really healthy for you.

00:30:33.336 --> 00:30:34.837
But not many people like it.

00:30:35.557 --> 00:30:36.658
Not many people!

00:30:36.678 --> 00:30:38.259
It can be acquired.

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.300
It's an acquired taste.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:39.981
It's really fine.

00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:41.262
I'm sure enough people like it.

00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:41.962
I like it!

00:30:42.042 --> 00:30:42.823
It's delicious!

00:30:42.843 --> 00:30:44.084
I want to be able to eat it.

00:30:44.144 --> 00:30:47.006
It's good for you, but it's difficult.

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:49.508
Didn't you already say it was delicious?

00:30:49.768 --> 00:30:50.169
I did.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:56.014
There was a bean stuck to it, so I took it.

00:30:56.175 --> 00:30:58.517
I got a new one today.

00:30:58.537 --> 00:30:59.718
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.741
Why is it kombu dashi?

00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:04.242
Oh, because that's how it is.

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:05.782
Oh, you're not putting it in though, right?

00:31:05.882 --> 00:31:07.023
I was gonna put it in for you.

00:31:07.043 --> 00:31:08.564
No, no, no, please don't!

00:31:10.005 --> 00:31:11.906
No, I don't want kombu dashi.

00:31:12.046 --> 00:31:12.686
Okay.

00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:13.727
Wow.

00:31:13.987 --> 00:31:18.949
Moco-chan, recently you haven't been the best with challenging things.

00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:19.249
I know.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:20.130
But!

00:31:21.243 --> 00:31:23.264
Okay, now stir it in, Moco-chan.

00:31:23.284 --> 00:31:24.485
I think I stirred it in.

00:31:24.545 --> 00:31:28.448
There might be a bit of wasabi bubble in it.

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:55.461
It smells really good, Moco-chan!

00:31:55.481 --> 00:31:58.745
You're gonna beat your personal record today, right?

00:31:58.865 --> 00:31:59.145
No.

00:31:59.445 --> 00:32:00.747
What was my personal record?

00:32:00.927 --> 00:32:02.048
Eight beans!

00:32:02.649 --> 00:32:02.989
Yeah.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.950
Why?

00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:05.452
How did I do that, though?

00:32:05.752 --> 00:32:06.213
You did it.

00:32:06.473 --> 00:32:08.555
So you can do it again today, okay?

00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:12.259
And that way you can give confidence to the Ruffians, too.

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:13.701
And then, you know...

00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:20.942
Be able to protect the Ruffian smile for many, many years with the power of all the good vitamins of a natto, right?

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:22.503
I did it with sesame oil!

00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:27.123
Well, today you have wasabi, so... Good luck!

00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:29.244
Okay, FUWAMOCO-chan first.

00:32:29.704 --> 00:32:37.385
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Canada and the United States of America who work hard to make this.

00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:38.545
Yeah.

00:32:39.065 --> 00:32:41.526
I tried getting another natto, but it's still firm.

00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:44.966
Canada and America.

00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:47.447
BAU BAU!

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:49.127
Thank you for your voice!

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.508
Moco-chan.

00:32:50.628 --> 00:32:52.128
It's really gooey!

00:32:53.289 --> 00:32:54.869
Why is it so gooey today?

00:33:07.372 --> 00:33:08.533
Moco-chan.

00:33:08.693 --> 00:33:09.814
Wasabi's gonna be rough?

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:10.554
I don't know.

00:33:10.934 --> 00:33:13.136
It's like strong flavor, strong flavor.

00:33:13.156 --> 00:33:14.577
I think it'll be good.

00:33:14.617 --> 00:33:18.039
If anything, I feel like you need more wasabi.

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:18.839
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:19.479
Hurry up!

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:20.860
We're over time!

00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:22.881
What about the Doggie of the Day?

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:25.643
The Doggie of the Day is the girl you're happy with who gets cut!

00:33:25.683 --> 00:33:28.305
The air conditioning made it waft into my face!

00:33:29.436 --> 00:33:32.237
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:33:32.257 --> 00:33:33.418
Here we go!

00:33:33.838 --> 00:33:34.178
One bean?

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:38.800
One bean, okay!

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.542
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:33:42.582 --> 00:33:45.363
Just wait, just wait!

00:33:45.664 --> 00:33:50.086
No, no, wait, just wait.

00:33:50.966 --> 00:33:52.907
There's too many, it's too sticky!

00:33:58.445 --> 00:34:03.513
We're gonna be strong.

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:09.301
Oh, it's falling.

00:34:11.454 --> 00:34:14.395
No, no, no... Moco-chan!

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:19.377
You can't do... Did you just spit it back into that?

00:34:20.357 --> 00:34:23.438
It touched my tongue, okay?

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:25.119
I just dropped it off of my tongue.

00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:32.461
Moco-chan, if you don't eat a bean, this is gonna be the worst... The worst weekly challenge ever.

00:34:34.422 --> 00:34:35.162
Why not?

00:34:37.023 --> 00:34:39.543
Should I put the dashi into it?

00:34:40.004 --> 00:34:40.444
No!

00:34:40.464 --> 00:34:40.544
No?

00:34:40.604 --> 00:34:40.744
No.

00:34:44.508 --> 00:34:49.535
See, this is why we have to do this on a regular basis, okay, Moco-chan?

00:34:49.836 --> 00:34:51.218
It's really cold, though.

00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:52.940
That's good, no?

00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.284
It's actually better at room temperature.

00:34:55.304 --> 00:34:57.187
It's healthier for you.

00:34:57.207 --> 00:34:57.287
Yeah.

00:35:01.852 --> 00:35:04.053
Pon-de-rings are waiting for you, Moco-chan!

00:35:04.093 --> 00:35:05.694
The pon-de-rings are waiting for you!

00:35:05.714 --> 00:35:07.734
It's too late at night for pon-de-rings, okay?

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:12.096
Actually, I heard that they're changing the recipe for pon-de-rings.

00:35:12.536 --> 00:35:15.758
And that they might be using natto from here on out.

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:20.320
So you better get used to it, okay, Moco-chan?

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.260
Here she goes!

00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:24.241
Try again!

00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:25.522
This is looking better.

00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:26.542
Okay, okay.

00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:34.704
FUWAMOCO-CHAN!

00:35:34.824 --> 00:35:39.829
IT'S TAKING ME A WHILE!

00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:41.875
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:45.674
Well, today was the worst attempt ever.

00:35:45.814 --> 00:35:49.658
Yeah, Moco-baby is back.

00:35:50.538 --> 00:35:52.180
And now I have to eat this.

00:35:54.122 --> 00:35:55.323
Thanks, Moco-chan!

00:35:57.728 --> 00:35:58.529
BAU BAU!

00:35:58.549 --> 00:36:00.051
Oh, Ruffians.

00:36:00.692 --> 00:36:04.696
Just remember when there's something rough this week that comes in front of you.

00:36:05.838 --> 00:36:07.019
Okay, I'm gonna do it!

00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:10.623
I'm gonna show Moco-chan just how much stronger I am!

00:36:10.823 --> 00:36:12.285
I'm not a Moco baby!

00:36:12.305 --> 00:36:14.347
I'm a strong Ruffian!

00:36:17.951 --> 00:36:22.213
I feel like I am dealing with enough challenges this week, okay?

00:36:22.873 --> 00:36:25.454
Some of them can't go as great as others.

00:36:26.154 --> 00:36:28.955
So, this one, that's okay.

00:36:29.715 --> 00:36:31.936
Other challenges, I'll work harder.

00:36:36.107 --> 00:36:36.567
BAU BAU.

00:36:36.948 --> 00:36:37.869
BAU BAU!

00:36:37.969 --> 00:36:38.870
I think that's fair.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.071
You're not wrong.

00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:40.431
Yeah.

00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:41.652
BAU BAU!

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.295
Ruffians!

00:36:44.315 --> 00:36:49.279
I'm ready to see the Doggie of the Day!

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.921
Are you ready with me?

00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:52.082
Yeah!

00:36:52.102 --> 00:36:58.008
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is... Today is Binba!

00:36:59.029 --> 00:37:02.831
Viva is so cute!

00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:03.772
That is a puppy.

00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:04.533
The nose.

00:37:04.913 --> 00:37:10.777
The pink area around the nose.

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:12.398
It's so cute.

00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:17.142
Viva is a brand new addition to this Ruffian family.

00:37:17.222 --> 00:37:19.123
It sounds like she's doing her best too.

00:37:20.444 --> 00:37:24.066
Ruffians, let's give her lots of virtual head pats next.

00:37:24.126 --> 00:37:25.226
Lots of support!

00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:28.387
She's doing her best in this new family.

00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:32.269
And you know there's lots of rules and new people to get used to.

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:34.529
It can be surprising sometimes, huh?

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.451
It can be a little rough at first, but... Hang in there, BIMBO!

00:37:38.531 --> 00:37:40.992
Hang in there, BIMBO!

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.772
BAU BAU!

00:37:42.813 --> 00:37:43.133
BAU BAU!

00:37:43.173 --> 00:37:43.613
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:45.393
How does BIMBO BAU BAU?

00:37:47.175 --> 00:37:47.616
BAU BAU!

00:37:48.178 --> 00:37:48.620
BAU BAU!

00:37:49.402 --> 00:37:49.703
BAU BAU!

00:37:54.152 --> 00:37:55.133
Tiny BAU BAUs.

00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.394
They'll get bigger.

00:37:56.685 --> 00:37:58.606
You'll get bigger, yeah, huh?

00:37:58.626 --> 00:37:59.146
BAU BAU!

00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:00.566
BAU BAU!

00:38:00.606 --> 00:38:02.967
But Bimbo's just a baby!

00:38:03.027 --> 00:38:03.847
A baby!

00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:06.328
She's new to everything and... Bimbo baby.

00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:11.429
You know, that also means that there's some very exciting and cute discoveries to be made.

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:14.250
But maybe also some stumbles along the way too.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.590
Make sure you catch her, okay?

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:16.230
Yeah.

00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:18.251
We're rooting for you, Bimbo!

00:38:18.311 --> 00:38:19.031
BAU BAU!

00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:20.812
BAU BAU!

00:38:21.687 --> 00:38:22.407
So cute.

00:38:22.487 --> 00:38:23.288
Bimbo baby.

00:38:23.368 --> 00:38:27.711
Yeah, but Bimbo... I heard Bimbo can eat natto.

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.032
Yeah.

00:38:29.532 --> 00:38:37.178
Not the biggest baby here.

00:38:37.238 --> 00:38:42.782
BAU BAU!

00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:43.542
See the stuff.

00:38:44.203 --> 00:38:44.563
Do it!

00:38:45.484 --> 00:38:48.326
Moco-chan, do you feel like you wanna go for a walk right now?

00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:50.389
Yeah.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.832
Well, let's see, Ruffians, where have you been going for a walk?

00:38:53.892 --> 00:38:56.475
And then maybe Moco-chan can go up and follow you.

00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:59.497
De-den!

00:38:59.517 --> 00:38:59.557
Oh!

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:00.898
Wait, is this a lion?

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:05.642
That looks like a nice, relaxing, refreshing walk!

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:09.986
Maybe a good place to go when you need a walk, huh?

00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:13.629
Maybe we need to get away from your sister.

00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:15.069
Maybe.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.130
But look!

00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:17.611
Hi!

00:39:17.671 --> 00:39:19.792
Moco-chan, there's a lot of friends.

00:39:20.372 --> 00:39:22.133
A lot of friends at this welfare camp.

00:39:22.173 --> 00:39:26.136
Good new friends to replace my sister with!

00:39:26.176 --> 00:39:27.476
Dogs and birds.

00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:28.697
Much better, huh?

00:39:28.777 --> 00:39:30.398
A super cute hedgehog!

00:39:30.478 --> 00:39:32.199
That's an improvement.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:34.100
Not so fluffy, maybe spiky.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.740
Spiky.

00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:36.922
We can be fuzzy and spiky together.

00:39:37.202 --> 00:39:37.782
Yeah.

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:38.863
But...

00:39:39.523 --> 00:39:40.405
That photo!

00:39:40.705 --> 00:39:41.426
Right?

00:39:41.767 --> 00:39:42.207
It's amazing!

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:45.692
Yeah, you got an amazing photo of the hedgehog too!

00:39:46.293 --> 00:39:52.843
It's too bad that the fox was a bit too fast, but I guess you know they have places to be, right?

00:39:53.618 --> 00:39:54.618
BAU BAU!

00:39:55.359 --> 00:40:03.161
And for our Question of the Day we have de-den!

00:40:03.582 --> 00:40:04.762
Hi Fuwawa!

00:40:05.042 --> 00:40:05.882
Hi Mococo!

00:40:05.922 --> 00:40:07.103
BAU BAU!

00:40:07.203 --> 00:40:13.225
I noticed that I've honestly started to build up a lot of draft tweets that stay in the shadow realm.

00:40:13.585 --> 00:40:21.408
So do either of you often make tweets that either never leave the draft zone or get started over from the beginning for something better?

00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:23.200
Yeah.

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:29.650
Actually, I was just looking at my drafts the other day because, you know, our phones.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:32.294
I have my drafts and Moco-chan, you have your drafts.

00:40:32.354 --> 00:40:33.235
Don't you, Shiori?

00:40:35.467 --> 00:40:40.910
And there is a lot of draft tweets that do never make it out to you, Ruffians.

00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:44.872
Most of the time though, it's not really that important.

00:40:45.132 --> 00:40:46.313
It's a little silly.

00:40:46.413 --> 00:40:54.597
I saw one talking about how I need to use all the bath salts because I bought extra bags on sale, but then I forgot about them.

00:40:55.217 --> 00:40:57.338
And then you forgot about that tweet too, huh?

00:40:57.538 --> 00:40:58.579
Yeah!

00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:03.161
Yeah, and there was one about Mama Puppy.

00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:09.404
Mama Puppy was like, FUWAMOCO, I'm busy right now, so I'll phone you back in 20 minutes.

00:41:09.704 --> 00:41:11.485
And it happened hours.

00:41:13.345 --> 00:41:13.766
Yeah.

00:41:14.126 --> 00:41:15.987
Moco-chan, you had a voice quest?

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:17.407
A voice tweet.

00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:18.908
Yeah.

00:41:19.008 --> 00:41:20.669
I think it might be probably...

00:41:21.636 --> 00:41:25.081
Some tweets that we don't understand anymore.

00:41:25.101 --> 00:41:26.462
Some very similarly nitty tweets.

00:41:36.936 --> 00:41:39.217
There's some dream tweets, too.

00:41:39.237 --> 00:41:41.299
I forgot about them, but then I saw them.

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:42.940
Oh yeah, the dream was cool!

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.880
So... Yeah.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.001
Yeah.

00:41:46.381 --> 00:41:46.942
Re-do.

00:41:47.482 --> 00:41:48.383
Release them!

00:41:48.443 --> 00:41:49.623
Release the tweets!

00:41:49.683 --> 00:41:51.084
Send the needy tweets!

00:41:51.224 --> 00:41:53.806
They'll all be very similar, but slightly different.

00:41:57.168 --> 00:41:57.748
Yeah.

00:41:58.168 --> 00:41:59.249
They're stuck there.

00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:01.170
Don't know what to do with them.

00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:04.300
BAU BAU!

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.442
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:17.286
FUWAMOCO Morning is back, and we want you to be able to share your works, your questions.

00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:19.307
I know you have lots of questions, Ruffians.

00:42:19.487 --> 00:42:21.168
Send your questions!

00:42:21.448 --> 00:42:22.849
Yeah, your Pero Sightings.

00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:29.592
Pero's around and about, but we're not too sure where, so let us know where you saw him so we can not go there.

00:42:31.235 --> 00:42:32.236
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:42:46.212 --> 00:42:52.459
Take FWMC scoop for any cool news or interesting things you see going on in hololive.

00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:54.481
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:42:54.622 --> 00:42:55.623
BAU BAU!

00:42:55.703 --> 00:42:56.303
Thank you!

00:42:56.664 --> 00:42:57.144
Wow.

00:42:57.425 --> 00:43:01.089
On our next team, we have De-den!

00:43:01.389 --> 00:43:03.492
Dogs organized neatly!

00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:04.332
By dogs.

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.236
It'll be my first time!

00:43:08.556 --> 00:43:09.337
I've already played it.

00:43:09.437 --> 00:43:12.179
I did a very good job organizing the dogs neatly.

00:43:12.479 --> 00:43:14.781
But this time Moco-chan's gonna be with me.

00:43:14.841 --> 00:43:16.982
I guess we're gonna start where you left off, huh?

00:43:17.062 --> 00:43:20.905
Yeah, so you better be pretty good, Moco-chan.

00:43:20.925 --> 00:43:22.626
So Ruffians, please help us!

00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:25.568
Yeah, we will definitely need help, okay?

00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:30.512
It's pretty puzzling sometimes, so... Please help us out, okay?

00:43:30.532 --> 00:43:31.332
BAU BAU!

00:43:32.513 --> 00:43:34.534
And we released a brand new schedule.

00:43:34.594 --> 00:43:36.676
Our first schedule in quite a while.

00:43:37.056 --> 00:43:40.818
But after that we have FUWAMOCO Morning this week.

00:43:41.038 --> 00:43:42.899
It's FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:43:42.939 --> 00:43:45.401
We're gonna be spending it with you Ruffians.

00:43:45.421 --> 00:43:46.301
So do your best.

00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:47.682
Episode 100.

00:43:48.122 --> 00:43:49.783
Set your alarm clock to three.

00:43:49.803 --> 00:43:54.326
And then we'll also be playing more Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:43:54.566 --> 00:43:54.946
See how the

00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:57.668
This nest is holding up.

00:43:58.089 --> 00:44:04.513
More Touhou Fuujin Rokui no Mari Senchou Senpai gave Moco-chan a bunch of new hints and tricks.

00:44:04.714 --> 00:44:06.535
We're so close to clearing it!

00:44:06.615 --> 00:44:11.539
Now you have to show that you still remember and that you can get closer to finishing it.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.321
We have some more Bambi readings.

00:44:14.481 --> 00:44:16.603
We can do a new game.

00:44:16.943 --> 00:44:18.044
Japanese horror game?

00:44:18.584 --> 00:44:22.005
I don't know, it looked very cute, so I'm gonna give it a try.

00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:24.947
And then some more Minecraft!

00:44:25.027 --> 00:44:36.431
If you see us try to explore Minecraft for the first time and do things wrong that are apparently common sense, I'm done with the Doggy Pack!

00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:39.152
We're gonna be watching Hachi a Dog's Tale.

00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:45.715
I first watched a lot in quite a while, so we hope you're ready for a movie night too, our friends.

00:44:46.415 --> 00:44:48.517
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:44:48.737 --> 00:44:50.079
BAU BAU!

00:44:50.379 --> 00:44:56.725
And for Ruffians who are joining us through the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO award!

00:44:57.606 --> 00:44:59.307
It's BAU BAU!

00:44:59.368 --> 00:45:00.288

Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.021
Salute!

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:46:04.175 --> 00:46:08.137
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:46:08.177 --> 00:46:10.379
