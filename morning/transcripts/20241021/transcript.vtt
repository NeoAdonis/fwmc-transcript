00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:23.328
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:29.030
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.172
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:36.813
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:39.354
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:47.676
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:52.297
Ruffians, thank you for waking up and joining us today for our 135th episode!

00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:53.097
BAU BAU!

00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:54.198
Are you sure?

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:55.598
It's 135th episode?

00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:58.218
Only 135 episodes.

00:05:58.278 --> 00:05:59.899
What do you mean only 135 episodes?

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:00.179
Only 135!

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.099
Do you think you should be 175 today, Moco-chan?

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:03.680
In fact, yes.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.421
1C5?

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:13.521
1C5!

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:13.701
Yes!

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:26.000
You've only woken up 130- I'm pretty sure there's been more times you've woken up than 135 times.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.401
That's 100 times that you woke up.

00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:31.161
And FUWAMOCO Morning was there to greet you!

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.782
BAU BAU!

00:06:33.922 --> 00:06:38.002
Well, hello fans who are joining us for the very first time today!

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:44.343
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:45.104
A.K.A.

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:45.904
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:46.024 --> 00:06:47.524
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:49.685
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:55.429
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.954
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:06.417
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:09.680
BAU BAU!

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.002
A new morning in a week?

00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:16.145
And all of a sudden October has just about ended too.

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.125
That's really frightening.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:23.266
That means it's almost November, Ruffians, and that's pretty much winter.

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:26.407
I'm not okay with that.

00:07:26.427 --> 00:07:27.287
Are we ready for this?

00:07:27.568 --> 00:07:28.948
I'm not ready for it.

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:31.268
Are we ready for that yet?

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.209
Do we agree to this?

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:35.350
Don't say that.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.250
I'm sorry, it's Halloween.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.610
It's almost Halloween.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.151
At least there's a little Halloween.

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.091
That's exciting, right, Moco-chan?

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:43.012
Scary games.

00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:44.552
Exciting.

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:51.129
Now.

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:56.374
Well, the scary things are for later into the month, right Moco-chan?

00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.216
But now, we have disappointing stuff!

00:08:00.858 --> 00:08:03.680
Can I have scary stuff instead of disappointing stuff?

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:07.864
Disappointing first.

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:10.387
Let's take a look then.

00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:11.648
Well.

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:15.714
You know how it goes!

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.276
I know how it goes!

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.738
Ruffians spotted Pero.

00:08:20.118 --> 00:08:25.123
Ruffians sent us Pero, which is good because then we can be informed when he was seen.

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:26.364
But it's still disappointing.

00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:27.585
It's still disappointing.

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:28.646
You're Oshicording!

00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:29.106
No!

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:30.888
Disappointment!

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:32.289
It's disappointment for you!

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:35.812
That's disappointing for me to hear that your oshi is Pero.

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:38.995
Let's see, where was he spotted?

00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:40.257
Let's take a look.

00:08:41.978 --> 00:08:42.098
De-den!

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:44.120
Wait, wait.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.220
A petal pumpkin.

00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.181
Petal pumpkin.

00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:50.123
A bit of a petal pumpkin.

00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:52.184
A little bit of a petal pumpkin.

00:08:52.244 --> 00:08:53.485
Petal pumpkin.

00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:55.206
A petal petal pumpkin.

00:08:55.246 --> 00:08:57.127
Petal petal pumpkin.

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:58.868
Don't petal petal the petal pumpkin.

00:08:58.888 --> 00:09:02.090
I don't know who I'm with.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.691
He's nasty usually, right?

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:08.894
But as a pumpkin like this, he can't talk badly.

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:10.695
Yeah, he can't fly.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:13.356
No, he can't do anything really.

00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:17.839
I guess the only thing he can do is just bring some Halloween spookiness to us.

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:18.439
Right.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.380
And disappointment.

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:24.118
This is the best outcome though, right, Ruffians?

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:24.699
Yes!

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.661
Yeah, Pup Pero!

00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:27.863
Pup Pero!

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:29.445
Pero Pero Pumpkin!

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:31.807
Pumpkin pie!

00:09:31.968 --> 00:09:34.050
I present a Pero Pero Pumpkin!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.151
I don't know!

00:09:40.689 --> 00:09:42.210
Take it on this form now!

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.094
Yeah, and you know, once Halloween passes, he's just gonna rot away and become one with the soil.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:47.694
Right!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:48.475
This is the best!

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:49.776
This is the best!

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:51.958
Yeah, I don't know if we can make him into a pumpkin.

00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:55.600
I think that'd be a pretty nasty pumpkin pie.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.582
He's already a pumpkin.

00:09:57.642 --> 00:10:00.264
We can't make him into a pumpkin when he's already a pumpkin.

00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:00.504
Yeah.

00:10:01.104 --> 00:10:03.226
But yeah, this is probably the best, right?

00:10:04.347 --> 00:10:06.609
But, uh... I don't know, maybe...

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:11.018
But I'm going for good afterwards, like just out of the way.

00:10:11.038 --> 00:10:11.378
What?

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:14.080
There is that knife there, right?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.621
Garbage can.

00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:16.442
Good boy.

00:10:16.863 --> 00:10:17.243
Knife.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:19.605
BAU BAU.

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:22.087
BAU BAU!

00:10:22.828 --> 00:10:23.328
BAU BAU!

00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:26.451
Peta Pumpkin is biodegradable?

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.411
He is!

00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:27.752
He is!

00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:33.533
Not great, but okay for the moment.

00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:34.734
Biodegradable?

00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:35.556
Yeah.

00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:37.578
Not biodegradable?

00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:38.900
De-badable.

00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:40.282
It's not great.

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:41.223
I agree.

00:10:41.404 --> 00:10:42.165
It's sort of bad.

00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:42.765
Biode-badable.

00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:44.047
BAU BAU!

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:49.091
Well, Ruffians!

00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:52.434
FUWAMOCO, we have something new!

00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:54.495
Exciting!

00:10:54.515 --> 00:11:01.260
Wow, we just released our very first ASMR voice pack, Ruffians!

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.623
BAU BAU!

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.244
Thank you!

00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:09.547
Everyday with FUWAMOCO!

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:13.114
What did you think?

00:11:13.154 --> 00:11:18.255
Yeah, it was my very first time in a serious attempted ASMR.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:19.995
You bought it!

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:20.675
Yeah!

00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:23.996
It made me super nervous!

00:11:24.877 --> 00:11:26.157
BAU BAU!

00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:28.297
Look the cute visual here.

00:11:28.338 --> 00:11:29.498
So cute too!

00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:31.758
You like the preview?

00:11:31.818 --> 00:11:32.499
Yeah!

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:34.899
Right, there's a preview too.

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:35.959
Ruffians.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.240
Wow.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.141
You know, this is our first ASMR.

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:45.322
It wasn't just FUWAMOCO, you know, on our own.

00:11:45.462 --> 00:11:49.042
We had two Patrasche!

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:53.543
She wrote Lifetime, Showtime, our original introduction song.

00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:57.724
And then she's also known as the ASMR goddess.

00:11:57.804 --> 00:12:00.365
I feel like we're the only ones that are calling her that.

00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:02.485
She's definitely the ASMR goddess to me.

00:12:03.396 --> 00:12:07.538
But she produced and oversaw everything of it!

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:15.661
And we even recorded it at her extra fancy ASMR studio too!

00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:21.643
But you know, we've seen a bunch of very happy Ruffians!

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:24.224
Lots of great people!

00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:26.945
Happy Ruffians!

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:30.486
Maybe happy is a simple word to describe it.

00:12:32.477 --> 00:12:33.457
Very happy.

00:12:33.538 --> 00:12:34.178
I don't know.

00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:36.919
FUWAMOCO didn't vote in English and Japanese.

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.800
We hope you check it out.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.342
And you know what the Ruffians are saying.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.583
You can check out sample.

00:12:44.603 --> 00:12:50.085
There's a sample on the hololive English YouTube with a very cute video.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:51.406
Special video.

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:57.789
Or you can also go check it out on the official hololive shop and there's sample voices there as well.

00:12:57.869 --> 00:12:58.389
I feel like...

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.731
The video is really long.

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:03.855
I was really surprised!

00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:05.257
It's really long.

00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:11.420
I feel like if it's on the official shop, it's a bit hidden.

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.782
Now it's on the YouTube.

00:13:16.043 --> 00:13:18.144
Go take a look, Ruffians!

00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:24.108
And please go check it out on the official hololive shop too!

00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:25.289
We did our best!

00:13:25.349 --> 00:13:32.013
Right, we did our best and we're really really excited to be able to do this very special project together with Patraone-san!

00:13:32.173 --> 00:13:34.855
It was a long time in the works!

00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:36.395
We're happy.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.055
We're happy.

00:13:37.095 --> 00:13:42.497
You know, finally it made it to the Ruffians part, you know.

00:13:42.777 --> 00:13:50.018
Also, we had a very special 3D collab stream the other day with Patra Onee-san, too.

00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:54.359
So please check out the archive here on our channel if you haven't yet.

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:56.460
We did a bunch of different things.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.241
It's like a lot of different ASMR related games.

00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:02.621
And things got very crazy.

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:06.643
Shoving it!

00:14:07.564 --> 00:14:10.507
Right into my chest!

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:14.531
Patara oneesan is so bull.

00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:15.832
She's like this, like this!

00:14:15.932 --> 00:14:17.114
Here you go!

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:18.555
Right, she's so bull.

00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:20.657
I learned a lot from her.

00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:22.439
Yeah, she was...

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.004
Stepping on the Ruffians too, but we are doing our best to get off the bed!

00:14:28.344 --> 00:14:29.585
I was getting ready!

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:30.286
Right?

00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:33.288
And I just look over there like, what are you doing?

00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:42.296
But we learn a lot from her, you know, not just ASMR, but a lot, a lot.

00:14:42.336 --> 00:14:47.921
But you know, we also sung a very fun song together, played the unison dance,

00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:49.601
Please check it out again!

00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:55.283
We'll also be doing a special after party to talk about later this week, so please join us!

00:14:55.343 --> 00:15:01.225
Yeah, and we'll kinda share maybe you know what went into it, our feelings and everything, you know?

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:01.325
Yeah!

00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:10.328
So we hope that you'll join us, and please please go check out the voice pack on the hololive official shop too, okay, Ruffians?

00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:11.829
BAU BAU!

00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:13.349
Thank you!

00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:15.670
It was really really special, so...

00:15:17.305 --> 00:15:18.666
BAU BAU!

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:19.988
Wow!

00:15:20.028 --> 00:15:23.931
There's more exciting news from hololive English!

00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:27.314
Over Bay-sa-buy!

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:32.759
She just announced yesterday that she's going to be doing a very special 3D Live!

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:39.565
And it's happening this weekend on Saturday the 26th at 8pm PT!

00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:40.846
So soon!

00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:42.007
So soon right?

00:15:45.671 --> 00:15:50.736
I was so surprised, but I'm really looking forward to it!

00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:56.022
She said she's gonna be focused on performing performance.

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:59.285
Mama Shiori's gonna be lots of amazing dancing for sure!

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:00.907
It is a pain in the butt.

00:16:01.007 --> 00:16:02.108
Right after all.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.750
As expected of a pain in the butt.

00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:08.734
And the title is Chuu-Nii-Bae.

00:16:09.954 --> 00:16:13.237
At first I was like, oh that's cute, it's Chuchu-Bae!

00:16:13.757 --> 00:16:19.060
It's like, oh that's very cute, Chuchu-Bae.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:24.524
But maybe that'll be better suited for Valentine's Day.

00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:26.926
Don't laugh at us, Ruffians!

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:28.147
We just read it!

00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:31.269
I was thinking we could all be based off this title.

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:32.750
Go bow to FWMC.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.183
It's not follow me, FUWAMOCO.

00:16:39.004 --> 00:16:40.725
Although that kind of sounds cool too.

00:16:41.226 --> 00:16:41.486
No.

00:16:42.207 --> 00:16:42.728
No!

00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:44.670
This is Bei-senpai's title.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.051
It's me, Bei-senpai.

00:16:46.151 --> 00:16:47.232
And we misread it.

00:16:48.554 --> 00:16:49.235
Somehow.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.137
BAU BAU!

00:16:52.518 --> 00:16:54.200
I have a strong case of...

00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:57.153
It's about me-byo.

00:16:57.173 --> 00:16:57.213
No!

00:16:57.573 --> 00:16:57.773
No!

00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:58.234
No!

00:16:58.274 --> 00:17:01.695
Make sure you don't miss it on KMOPT!

00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:05.897
Big congratulations to Bei-senpai!

00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:12.601
Yeah, and that again is on Saturday the 26th at 8pm PT.

00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:13.361
Okay.

00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:14.562
Let's make sure you know it.

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:20.244
Go check out everything that Bei-senpai's been working so hard for on KMOPT!

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:22.946
BAU BAU!

00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.052
BAU BAU!

00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:30.078
There's a lot of exciting things going on all around the globe right now!

00:17:43.512 --> 00:17:47.653
Pop-up store happening right now in Taichung!

00:17:47.873 --> 00:17:52.195
The hololive Chill Traveler based on hololive Super Expo 2025!

00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:58.116
You know there's a lot of FUWAMOCO fans that love that aloha shirt!

00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:04.558
This special pop-up store features over 250 limited edition products!

00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:09.100
250!

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.122
I don't even know Ruffians.

00:18:11.543 --> 00:18:20.852
Yeah, and of course you know there's acrylic stands, chibi items, foldable stuff, 4 holders, but there's also some very interesting things like helmets?

00:18:21.253 --> 00:18:24.256
Motorcycle mudguards and helmets.

00:18:24.997 --> 00:18:25.737
Yeah!

00:18:25.757 --> 00:18:27.860
So if you want ice to protect your head,

00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:30.207
We can.

00:18:30.427 --> 00:18:32.728
You know that we don't have to ask Atama daijoubu?

00:18:32.788 --> 00:18:32.988
Yeah!

00:18:33.008 --> 00:18:34.049
Because we'll be protecting it!

00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:35.049
Protecting it!

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:36.489
Okay!

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.510
Yeah, there's also visors too!

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.130
Yeah!

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.892
I really want to see what we're gonna... I'm so chill with my FUWAMOCO visor.

00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:49.334
Yeah, and I think the... The motorcycle, my car, it says stop.

00:18:49.894 --> 00:18:50.614
Stop!

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:51.895
Yeah, like the bike, the bike.

00:18:51.955 --> 00:18:52.275
Yeah!

00:18:52.315 --> 00:18:53.195
All right.

00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:53.736
Basket.

00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:54.596
Basket!

00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:59.558
Yeah, there's also large life-size pillows!

00:19:00.178 --> 00:19:01.759
Of course there are, Aloha Abyss!

00:19:01.979 --> 00:19:03.440
I was surprised.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.621
But there's also- Does the helmet do ASMR?

00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:06.921
I don't think so.

00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:11.263
Well, if you put a speaker inside and then... It's quite impossible!

00:19:11.303 --> 00:19:16.065
You could always put your headphones and then put the helmet on and then... No noise!

00:19:16.465 --> 00:19:20.267
Right, I don't know how ASMR while driving on the streets works, but...

00:19:20.956 --> 00:19:25.402
FUWAMOCO Not only FUWAMOCO but other FUWAMOCO members too!

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.517
Collectible card machines!

00:19:39.097 --> 00:19:44.279
Lots of things going on, so if you're in the area, please check it out!

00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:57.383
Right now it's October 15th, and it'll be ending November 11th, so hopefully you can go over and try to get your paws on some of the very very interesting, unique merchandise that's available!

00:19:57.883 --> 00:20:01.044
Not vegetable cards, collectible cards!

00:20:01.524 --> 00:20:03.405
Vegetable cards wouldn't be too awful.

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:05.506
I don't know what the collectible cards are made of.

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:06.987
They could be from vegetables.

00:20:07.087 --> 00:20:07.627
They could be.

00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:09.928
They are probably from vegetables, but maybe not.

00:20:10.548 --> 00:20:12.689
Maybe they're made out of plastic or acrylic.

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:12.849
Yeah.

00:20:12.869 --> 00:20:14.030
I don't know what vegetables.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.990
BAU BAU!

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.032
BAU BAU!

00:20:18.072 --> 00:20:19.372
Moco-moco.

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:21.253
I don't know if you want to moco-moco those.

00:20:21.313 --> 00:20:23.214
No, it's probably paper.

00:20:23.494 --> 00:20:25.235
BAU BAU!

00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:27.036
Don't try eating it.

00:20:27.116 --> 00:20:27.396
Okay?

00:20:27.456 --> 00:20:27.536
No.

00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:45.800
Somewhere's coming to an end, but that's okay because just recently there was a brand new video series released on the hololive English channel called Secret Island Vacation with hololive English!

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.662
This is to get out more fans!

00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:56.244
Wow, this video series, it's in the style of a visual novel!

00:20:56.665 --> 00:21:01.206
And you know, depending on the next video you click on, the story kind of branches off.

00:21:01.346 --> 00:21:03.267
It's a very cute project, you know?

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:04.807
And the script!

00:21:04.887 --> 00:21:08.849
The script was actually written by Calli-senpai herself!

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:12.010
So Ruffians, if you haven't checked it out yet, please do!

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.751
You can see a bunch of us hololive English members

00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:17.232
Swimsuits.

00:21:17.672 --> 00:21:21.134
You know, having fun on a secret island.

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:26.917
It gets pretty silly too.

00:21:26.977 --> 00:21:28.258
It's a bit silly.

00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:37.984
But you know, we saw some Ruffians joking that FUWAMOCO are 1 million wishes granted within 2 days or less.

00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:41.026
After reaching 1 million.

00:21:43.962 --> 00:21:44.442
Huh?

00:21:45.063 --> 00:21:46.024
Ruffians.

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:47.685
No.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.367
It's totally separate, okay?

00:21:50.487 --> 00:21:50.847
It's separate.

00:21:50.947 --> 00:21:51.688
It's not true.

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:53.890
It's not misunderstanding!

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.350
No.

00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:55.191
Yeah.

00:21:55.922 --> 00:21:57.303
Okay, Ruffians!

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:59.606
I think for some people it's hard to understand.

00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:01.607
When it's a joke.

00:22:02.368 --> 00:22:07.973
But you know, this is just a fun visual novel style video series, right?

00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:09.695
It's different.

00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:12.978
And you know, well, FUWAMOCO!

00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:19.244
We said that, you know, a visual novel game that that's what we would like to wish for with a million wishes.

00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:25.491
You know, a FUWAMOCO visual novel game produced by FUWAMOCO!

00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:26.712
This is our wish!

00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:27.913
It's not coming out!

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.301
So, hyakuman ni?

00:22:38.341 --> 00:22:39.262
Yeah.

00:22:39.482 --> 00:22:40.503
So, hyakuman ni?

00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:42.884
So, kimatta tte waki janakute.

00:22:43.284 --> 00:22:54.732
Yeah, I know it's, that's what we would like for our one million wish, but it doesn't mean that it's been granted or anything like that at all, Ruffians, so don't get confused, okay?

00:22:54.752 --> 00:22:56.113
But yeah, you know what?

00:22:56.473 --> 00:23:04.379
If it does get granted, it'll be very, very, very, very far off in the future, so...

00:23:06.227 --> 00:23:10.229
Maybe look forward to happening someday, okay?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.690
It's our wish.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.613
You'll just have to stick around until it comes to fruition then, right?

00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:16.173
BAU BAU!

00:23:16.213 --> 00:23:17.634
Kanaetara ii ne?

00:23:17.694 --> 00:23:18.134
Ii ne!

00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:20.936
BAU BAU!

00:23:31.381 --> 00:23:32.342
Ruffians!

00:23:32.502 --> 00:23:33.483
More wishes!

00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:34.323
More wishes!

00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:36.545
Well, FUWAMOCO!

00:23:37.006 --> 00:23:40.508
Just at the very beginning of August!

00:23:40.568 --> 00:23:41.089
Yes!

00:23:41.249 --> 00:23:46.793
Around our one year anniversary, we finally released our original song!

00:23:47.234 --> 00:23:48.395
Boy to be BAU!

00:23:48.415 --> 00:23:48.515
Yeah!

00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:50.156
BAU BAU!

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:52.078
BAU BAU Ruffians!

00:23:52.178 --> 00:23:55.420
I'm sure you've been listening to it lots and lots of nights!

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.222
Can you hear it right now?

00:23:57.242 --> 00:23:59.384
Are you singing along right now?

00:24:00.544 --> 00:24:01.264
Yeah!

00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:04.626
BAU BAU!

00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:07.348
Our original song was written by PandaBoY.

00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:10.250
PandaBoY's done a lot of songs for hololive.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.550
Idol songs too, you know.

00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:16.153
Blue Clapper, a bunch of them, and Point to Be Bottles, one of them.

00:24:16.213 --> 00:24:20.135
It's a very special song that I'm not sure you know well, so...

00:24:21.256 --> 00:24:22.578
It just recently reached over 950,000 views on YouTube!

00:24:22.889 --> 00:24:24.973
Over 950,000 views on YouTube!

00:24:25.153 --> 00:24:25.694
Oh my god!

00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:29.181
Thank you so much, my friend!

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.445
It's approaching the big one million!

00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:33.228
One million!

00:24:33.829 --> 00:24:36.694
We're forever going to have an original song!

00:24:37.054 --> 00:24:38.797
One million views on YouTube!

00:24:38.858 --> 00:24:39.399
It's a million!

00:24:39.637 --> 00:24:40.178
Thank you so much, FU

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:46.083
It's just a little more!

00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:03.817
And you can see, you know, the little Polly FUWAMOCO here dancing even more as well.

00:25:04.197 --> 00:25:04.978
Heck yeah!

00:25:05.078 --> 00:25:05.658
Heck yeah!

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:07.099
Oh BAU!

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.479
Oh BAU!

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.940
We're just so happy!

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.022
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for loving FUWAMOCO lots and lots!

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.322
We hope we can release even more music in the future too!

00:25:20.442 --> 00:25:21.423
I know!

00:25:21.443 --> 00:25:25.125
The next big goal that we're gonna aim for is a solo live.

00:25:25.485 --> 00:25:27.666
And we kinda need original music for that.

00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:28.147
Right!

00:25:28.807 --> 00:25:31.248
So... We're gonna have fun!

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:32.389
BAU BAU!

00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:34.971
Thank you!

00:25:36.064 --> 00:25:39.525
FUWAMOCO, my favorite place in the world.

00:25:39.925 --> 00:25:41.685
Akihabara MisDo.

00:25:58.749 --> 00:25:59.910
It's gonna be closing.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.450
Wait!

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.173
I can't hear you!

00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:06.835
You know, we wanted to do something special.

00:26:07.236 --> 00:26:12.079
And we wanted to buy a bunch of pon-de-rings from there and have a party!

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.561
A big party!

00:26:13.621 --> 00:26:21.687
Yeah, and you know, we talked about before in the previous FUWAMOCO Morning about that we were able to buy 100 pon-de-rings at once.

00:26:22.207 --> 00:26:27.491
And you know, so we wanted to do that again and ask Mane-chan for her to help us.

00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:30.995
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:33.038
Have a howl of a day!

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:34.259
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:35.761
Have a howl of a day!

00:26:46.594 --> 00:26:49.117
Yeah, but you know Mare-chan.

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:53.243
Mare-chan, she hasn't ordered a big amount of pon-de-rings before.

00:26:53.523 --> 00:26:55.466
You know, that makes sense.

00:26:55.486 --> 00:26:58.950
So she wasn't really very sure about how many we could order.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.515
And especially, you know, there's gonna be closing soon, so we're busy.

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:03.116
Why?

00:27:04.117 --> 00:27:10.780
But, ima Mari-chan was like, okay FUWAMOCO, I'll order as many as I can get my paws on!

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.202
And she was able to get 80 paws on!

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.463
We are so happy!

00:27:19.503 --> 00:27:23.805
So we checked Twitter to see if Ruffians are going to Akibomi so we can still get pundies!

00:27:24.545 --> 00:27:25.945
We were still having porno.

00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:29.326
I was kind of worried, you know, if we buy a bunch of them.

00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:30.946
I was a little worried.

00:27:30.986 --> 00:27:37.548
I was worried that maybe all the Ruffians visiting the Akihabara MisDo, they wouldn't be able to get pornoings.

00:27:37.968 --> 00:27:41.389
They still have pornoings, so I'm glad we didn't buy them all.

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:46.190
But you know, we're able to have a big porno party!

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:46.890
And you know...

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.372
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:50.412 --> 00:27:51.813
Have a howl of a day!

00:28:07.264 --> 00:28:08.164
They were all gone!

00:28:08.404 --> 00:28:10.345
All EVE had disappeared!

00:28:10.385 --> 00:28:14.286
Before we even finished up with the night!

00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:15.907
We were so happy!

00:28:16.007 --> 00:28:18.668
Everybody was so happy!

00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:18.988
Right!

00:28:19.028 --> 00:28:21.489
We didn't have any leftovers afterwards.

00:28:21.629 --> 00:28:21.889
Right!

00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:27.831
And we're so happy to be able to, you know, enjoy our last Akibameetsu department together!

00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:31.912
And we got another very special receipt to treasure somehow.

00:28:32.652 --> 00:28:34.092
How many do we eat?

00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:34.753
Ruffians!

00:28:34.793 --> 00:28:36.173
How many do you think we eat?

00:28:36.193 --> 00:28:37.493
10 each.

00:28:37.754 --> 00:28:37.755
2040!

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:37.757
2040!

00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:37.759
2040!

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:37.761
2040!

00:28:37.762 --> 00:28:37.763
2040!

00:28:38.834 --> 00:28:39.494
We each had...

00:28:58.477 --> 00:28:58.717
One!

00:28:59.038 --> 00:29:04.163
Because you know, it was a big day for us so we were nervous.

00:29:04.363 --> 00:29:07.466
We're not really in the pon-de-ring eating mode.

00:29:10.119 --> 00:29:10.959
This song!

00:29:10.979 --> 00:29:15.341
I have one and I was happy with my one.

00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:18.102
Right, a very special one.

00:29:18.142 --> 00:29:20.282
That's all I needed!

00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:22.183
Ten each is basic!

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.243
But we are busy!

00:29:24.664 --> 00:29:26.004
Ten each is a lot.

00:29:26.444 --> 00:29:30.465
You know, if we couldn't be doing ASMR, we can't eat a bunch of pon-de-ring.

00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:32.306
Same with dancing, you see!

00:29:32.326 --> 00:29:35.427
Mine is already a lot!

00:29:37.811 --> 00:29:43.533
I'm not hungry, I'm not hungry.

00:29:44.494 --> 00:29:51.577
But it was a very special memory, so... A pon-de-ring ASMR soon?

00:29:51.877 --> 00:29:52.117
No.

00:29:52.537 --> 00:29:55.758
Like kinda when you put the piece of sashimi in front of the kitten and it's like...

00:29:59.081 --> 00:29:59.181
No!

00:29:59.201 --> 00:29:59.801
BAU BAU!

00:29:59.821 --> 00:30:09.706
We hope that you can enjoy some pon-de-ring soon, Ruffians!

00:30:09.726 --> 00:30:11.287
BAU BAU!

00:30:11.807 --> 00:30:15.309
Let's check out who's our Doggie of the Day today!

00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:17.690
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.111
BAU BAU!

00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:24.013
Here's my BAU BAU!

00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:25.694
Today's Doggie of the Day is BAU BAU!

00:30:25.754 --> 00:30:27.395
BAU BAU!

00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:31.156
I don't think that's his name though.

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:32.497
Here is my BAU BAU.

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:36.079
Look at how relaxed this doggy is.

00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:38.100
How relaxed BAU BAU is.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.261
BAU BAU's tummy is just like... BAU BAU.

00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:42.762
Look at those paws.

00:30:43.362 --> 00:30:46.504
Those cute little cross paws.

00:30:46.724 --> 00:30:47.865
Very sweet.

00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:50.806
We have perfect ears too.

00:30:50.846 --> 00:30:51.867
Very triangle.

00:30:51.887 --> 00:30:55.268
They look very similar to certain someone's, huh?

00:30:57.567 --> 00:30:59.668

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:21.260
Maybe after 10 fun days.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.881
Maybe!

00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:23.882
BAU BAU!

00:31:24.002 --> 00:31:27.065

00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:28.886
How does BAU BAU BAU BAU?

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:04.536
We should all aspire to be like BAU BAU here.

00:32:04.616 --> 00:32:06.937
Especially with the cold season coming up.

00:32:07.217 --> 00:32:10.678

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:13.959

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:18.105
Wow!

00:32:18.325 --> 00:32:20.586
Let's take a look, Ruffians!

00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:22.667
You've been continuing your walks, right?

00:32:22.687 --> 00:32:23.367
Yeah!

00:32:23.747 --> 00:32:25.848
Let's see where you went on today!

00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:27.368
I went on a walk!

00:32:27.388 --> 00:32:29.509
We have... De-den!

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:37.832
You were able to stop by and have some fun over at Round1!

00:32:38.372 --> 00:32:42.434
And look, you got our special collab drinks and coasters!

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:47.196
Oh my gosh, and the Ruffian plushies are there with you too!

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:48.916
BAU BAU!

00:32:49.056 --> 00:32:53.098
In case you don't know, Ruffians, right now, Round1, we have a special collab!

00:32:53.478 --> 00:33:02.925
There's a special hololive event happening at Round1 Entertainment Center locations all across Japan and the US right now.

00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:05.826
So you can go check it out too!

00:33:05.847 --> 00:33:09.989
But I'm so glad this Ruffian looks like they had a super fun time.

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.951
Maybe they did some karaoke or bowling.

00:33:12.971 --> 00:33:14.532
Or some of the UFO Catching game.

00:33:17.314 --> 00:33:25.483
But there'll be even more fun stuff released and happening soon at Wawon, so we hope that you can go soon, Ruffians!

00:33:25.544 --> 00:33:27.085
Yeah, please check it out!

00:33:27.646 --> 00:33:29.688

Let's take a look at our Question of the Day.

00:33:41.557 --> 00:33:44.217
We have De-den!

00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:46.458
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:52.060
I've been participating in a lot of collaborations with other hololive members lately.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.264
I was wondering if you would be interested in organizing some kind of project yourself someday.

00:33:58.664 --> 00:34:01.786
It's great to see so many different kinds of collaborations.

00:34:01.846 --> 00:34:04.568
We've been having lots of fun.

00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:10.212
We've been really happy to be getting lots of different invitations to collabs recently.

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:18.478
But FUWAMOCO, you know, we've been thinking that it would be nice one day to organize our own big collab.

00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:20.180
But recently,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.124
We get a bit nervous when we are organizing things, you know.

00:34:27.485 --> 00:34:32.428
Not only is it kind of hard for us to figure out the best game, the right game to play.

00:34:32.848 --> 00:34:39.113
We get really nervous, you know, if our collab partners are having a lot of fun and the viewers are all having fun.

00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:44.336
Sometimes we aren't really able to relax and have fun ourselves.

00:34:45.397 --> 00:34:55.311
So, you know for now I think we kind of prefer to be able to focus on our own projects and have fun together with everyone else in other ways.

00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:58.235
Yeah, get a bit more experience right first.

00:34:58.255 --> 00:35:00.078
Yeah, maybe that's a little bit better.

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:01.358
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:33.063
We need to go to the onsen, eat some yaki mochi, relax.

00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:35.624
That sounds goooood.

00:35:35.744 --> 00:35:45.628
Well thank you so much Ruffians for all of your submissions!

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:50.210
Please don't forget that FUWAMOCO is something that we make together.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.611
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:51.671

00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:53.552
FUWAMOCO is us.

00:35:54.293 --> 00:36:00.278
It's something that we make together with you, so we're always looking for your Doggie of the Day.

00:36:00.338 --> 00:36:01.640
Send us your doggy!

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.123
Your Pero Sighting so we can all stay informed.

00:36:05.243 --> 00:36:07.685
And be disciplined a bit.

00:36:08.306 --> 00:36:11.749
That we can get some of your questions, you know?

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:17.295
And also see the walks that you've been going on, especially with all the leaves changing colors and everything.

00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:18.376
It'll be nice.

00:36:19.596 --> 00:36:22.177

It's gonna be having our first ASMR afterparty!

00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:43.290
We wanted to talk all about it, what it was like, our feelings.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.833
I hope she knows what it was like together.

00:36:46.853 --> 00:36:48.494
She wanna know what you thought too.

00:36:48.534 --> 00:36:50.436
Yeah, we wanna talk all about it.

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:56.001

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.681
Cuz I'm just expecting an interview with a vampire.

00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:28.662
Nerissa wanted to watch it and you know knowing Nerissa it's probably like a vampire that Nerissa would like.

00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:31.103
So I don't think it's gonna be a scary vampire.

00:38:31.163 --> 00:38:36.104
So he'll have the white hair like the guy from Baldur's Gate?

00:38:36.164 --> 00:38:36.744
Yeah!

00:38:36.764 --> 00:38:38.704
I don't know if he's a vampire though.

00:38:38.784 --> 00:38:41.385
Is he just a guy like a bad guy?

00:38:41.545 --> 00:38:42.085
I don't know.

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.866
Probably somebody like that will be interviewing him.

00:38:45.246 --> 00:38:47.126
Then who's the Baldur's Gate guy?

00:38:47.146 --> 00:38:49.547
Remingo.

00:38:50.426 --> 00:38:51.428
Eldin.

00:38:51.548 --> 00:38:52.189

Close to Eldin!

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:54.231
That was close!

00:38:54.272 --> 00:38:57.075
He doesn't have any rings.

00:39:02.941 --> 00:39:03.241
No!

00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:05.722
It's Thursday!

00:39:06.142 --> 00:39:08.283

00:39:15.746 --> 00:39:21.648
Don't know much about it except that it's gonna be happening at 5am PT or 6am!

00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:23.669
8am!

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:24.769
ET!

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:31.032
So it might be a little bit early but well I'm sure it'll probably be very silly!

00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:31.092
Hi.

00:39:32.172 --> 00:39:32.794
Don't worry.

00:39:32.934 --> 00:39:34.277
Question, question, question mark.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:35.380
Bye bye!

00:39:41.127 --> 00:39:42.549
BAU BAU!

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:50.576
I think it was just recently announced, but there's gonna be some hololive EM racing also happening!

00:39:51.277 --> 00:39:57.983
I'm a little bit nervous, but there's also gonna be some exciting things going on, not just racing maybe!

00:39:58.003 --> 00:40:04.610
I said of course that I know we should practice, but I heard that it's very very difficult.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:10.672
And that, rather than having a controller, you should have an actual wheel.

00:40:11.252 --> 00:40:14.413
I'm wondering if we order a wheel, will it arrive in time?

00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:16.634
It's really important!

00:40:16.674 --> 00:40:17.754
Let's order a wheel, Moco-chan!

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.494
I wanna see it too!

00:40:20.215 --> 00:40:23.796
Okay, you have one paw on the wheel, I'll have one paw on the wheel.

00:40:24.076 --> 00:40:25.536
Extreme realism?

00:40:25.676 --> 00:40:26.257
Yeah!

00:40:26.677 --> 00:40:30.118
Are you sure you wanna see us racing with extreme realism?

00:40:30.158 --> 00:40:32.018
Yeah!

00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:35.660
Let's do our best, Moco-chan.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.380
BAU BAU!

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.941
I'm fighting!

00:40:40.161 --> 00:40:49.044
We have another FUWAMOCO Morning, but in the evening it's about to get a bunch of spookiness, because we're playing Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:54.746
I know I played at the pool, but it's because I didn't know what to play.

00:40:57.304 --> 00:40:58.806
We almost beat the first one!

00:40:58.826 --> 00:41:01.389
Apparently we're pretty good at it.

00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:03.112
Maybe we'll be pretty good at the second one.

00:41:03.132 --> 00:41:04.834
We're gonna need your help!

00:41:05.595 --> 00:41:11.563
And then Saturday we're gonna be doing a watch-along with Mikocchi-senpai's first solo live!

00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:13.866
I'm so excited, Mikocchi-senpai!

Recommended a long time ago.

00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:48.660
We didn't forget because Fubuki-senpai recommended it.

00:41:50.081 --> 00:41:50.742
Massage.

00:41:52.004 --> 00:41:53.265
Not a massage.

00:41:53.786 --> 00:41:55.067
I wish it was a massage.

00:41:55.207 --> 00:41:56.509
It's a massage.

00:41:56.609 --> 00:41:58.471
Although if it's by ghosts, I don't want it.

00:41:58.831 --> 00:42:03.577
Yeah, but Fubuki-senpai said FUWAMOCO you should play it, so we're gonna play it!

00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:07.474
Please hold our paws, Moco-chan.

00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:10.496
We're gonna need lots of paw holding, okay?

00:42:11.096 --> 00:42:12.337
Advent Sunday!

00:42:12.357 --> 00:42:15.819
We're gonna be having a nice, calm, relaxing time.

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:16.840
No spooky!

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.063
And just chatting together with you and doing some super chat reading as well.

00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:25.025
And that's all we coming up here!

00:42:32.727 --> 00:42:45.850
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:42:56.853 --> 00:42:57.674
