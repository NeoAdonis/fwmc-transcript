05:08.500 --> 05:10.899
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.479 --> 05:16.946
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.986 --> 05:19.208
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:19.248 --> 05:19.508
BAU BAU!

05:27.367 --> 05:32.633
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:33.113 --> 05:35.516
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:35.636 --> 05:38.700
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:38.760 --> 05:40.422
BAU BAU BAU!

05:40.442 --> 05:43.286
And today we have Shiori!

05:44.527 --> 05:45.008
Biboo!

05:45.688 --> 05:46.089
Nerissa!

05:47.082 --> 05:48.002
Fuwawa!

05:48.403 --> 05:49.623
Mococo!

05:49.923 --> 05:55.346
All of Advent, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:55.446 --> 05:58.367
BAU BAU!

05:58.847 --> 06:00.928
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

06:01.068 --> 06:08.851
Thank you, Advent, for being here to celebrate with us today, the 100th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:08.871 --> 06:11.733
Congratulations!

06:14.652 --> 06:22.096
We can't believe we made it to this big milestone episode today.

06:22.396 --> 06:27.960
And Alvin, thank you so much for wanting to be here today.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.561
You are in the flesh.

06:31.021 --> 06:31.882
I can poke you.

06:31.902 --> 06:33.182
We will tickle her.

06:33.222 --> 06:33.663
BAU BAU!

06:42.888 --> 06:45.330
BAU BAU!

06:45.611 --> 06:54.378
Maybe there's some Ruffians, some jailbirds, novelist pebbles, Adventrix joining us today for the very first time.

06:54.398 --> 06:56.040
Wish me quick cause today's the 100th episode.

06:58.782 --> 07:00.403
Right on!

07:01.023 --> 07:09.346
Well, to explain a little bit, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

07:09.486 --> 07:10.046
A.K.A.

07:10.106 --> 07:11.047
FUWAMOCO!

07:11.127 --> 07:13.748
Hosted by, usually, FUWAMOCO.

07:13.788 --> 07:14.448
But today!

07:14.468 --> 07:15.488
All of us!

07:15.508 --> 07:17.129
BAU BAU!

07:17.289 --> 07:21.170
I didn't realize it's FUWAMOCO.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.391
Oh, that's so smart!

07:22.471 --> 07:24.111
Wow!

07:24.191 --> 07:24.552
Yo!

07:24.612 --> 07:26.472
It took you 100 episodes, huh people?

07:26.492 --> 07:28.333
Yeah, I guess it did!

07:29.578 --> 07:31.144
I'll show you not the first time.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.100
Christmas.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.581
That was a Christmas episode.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.282
So Christmas?

07:40.442 --> 07:40.702
Yeah.

07:40.762 --> 07:42.202
It's a rare Christmas episode.

07:42.222 --> 07:43.442
Did you realize, Shiori?

07:43.482 --> 07:44.943
Nerissa?

07:45.163 --> 07:46.063
FWMC.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.884
Now you know.

07:49.664 --> 07:50.104
BAU BAU!

07:50.204 --> 07:51.145
It makes sense.

07:51.765 --> 07:54.066
That makes sense.

07:54.486 --> 07:55.546
But!

07:55.766 --> 07:56.386
You're here now.

07:56.586 --> 07:57.046
Yeah.

07:57.146 --> 07:57.547
Yeah.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.108
Wow, FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:01.128 --> 08:07.370
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

08:07.770 --> 08:11.332
Please tweet your thoughts, especially today, with the hashtag.

08:11.932 --> 08:14.693
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

08:15.073 --> 08:18.675
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:18.695 --> 08:19.475
BAU BAU!

08:24.493 --> 08:30.136
It's such a wonderful day!

08:30.176 --> 08:30.716
Nerissa!

08:30.796 --> 08:31.917
Nerissa Shiori!

08:32.797 --> 08:34.978
There's a special rule on FUWAMOCO Morning.

08:35.758 --> 08:37.279
You have to be loud.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.079
Got it!

08:38.099 --> 08:40.220
Because it's the morning!

08:40.341 --> 08:42.101
It's the morning!

08:51.138 --> 08:52.659
It's the boy again!

08:52.719 --> 08:52.819
Hi!

08:53.580 --> 08:54.240
Wow!

08:54.280 --> 08:58.303
Well, unfortunately we have something a little bit less nice than usual.

08:58.603 --> 08:58.843
What?

08:59.323 --> 08:59.584
What?

09:00.184 --> 09:01.024
What?

09:01.825 --> 09:04.326
There's been another pero sighting.

09:04.527 --> 09:04.667
What?

09:04.887 --> 09:05.427
But!

09:05.747 --> 09:07.929
Today's the 100th episode!

09:08.349 --> 09:09.470
It's special, you know!

09:09.490 --> 09:10.770
Beat that guy!

09:11.251 --> 09:11.951
Yeah!

09:12.852 --> 09:14.933
Why does he have to do this to us?

09:15.533 --> 09:17.134
Let's take a look then.

09:18.235 --> 09:18.415
What?

09:20.115 --> 09:21.717
Let's take a look at the Perroccino.

09:21.777 --> 09:24.299
Where did you see him this time, Ruffians?

09:26.381 --> 09:27.162
BAU BAU!

09:27.642 --> 09:28.063
It's me!

09:28.503 --> 09:29.984
The Great Perroccino!

09:30.365 --> 09:31.105
Did you miss me?

09:31.446 --> 09:31.926
That's great!

09:31.986 --> 09:32.206
Well...

09:41.303 --> 09:46.808
Even better than hearing those sweet words of yours, today is a big day to celebrate!

09:47.608 --> 09:55.855
It's episode 100 of FUWAMOCO Morning, hosted by none other than the lovely girlie of FUWAMOCAR!

09:56.276 --> 09:57.297
Have you heard of it?

09:58.157 --> 10:06.124
Well, you know, even though they call me nasty sometimes, FUWAMOCLANS, they've been working hard.

10:06.144 --> 10:09.747
Even though I'm off somewhere, it's not like

10:10.393 --> 10:13.454
I don't see all the hard work they put into the show.

10:14.215 --> 10:16.355
Constantly thinking on new topics.

10:17.016 --> 10:21.157
Waking up at 5am back in the Northwest Passage to prepare.

10:21.938 --> 10:26.840
Now staying up late in Japan to make sure that everything runs smoothly.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.761
It's not the easiest show to run.

10:30.861 --> 10:33.502
It takes a lot of dedication and planning.

10:34.163 --> 10:40.025
So, you know, you waking up three times a week and spending this time with them,

10:41.152 --> 10:42.873
I'm sure it means a lot.

10:43.554 --> 10:56.623
And while I might be nasty sometimes, even under all this muscle, I have a heart of gold that appreciates those girlyos and all of you raw friends.

10:56.863 --> 11:03.048
So please, continue to support FUWAMOCO, especially when they're working their tails off.

11:03.502 --> 11:05.683
And celebrate this big day with them.

11:05.843 --> 11:09.945
Because a hundred episodes isn't an easy feat.

11:10.605 --> 11:11.865
It's nothing to sniff at!

11:12.866 --> 11:15.327
And keep on trying to spot me, Ruffians.

11:15.887 --> 11:19.248
It's a big game of hide and go seek between you and me, ha?

11:19.268 --> 11:21.029
Try to find me!

11:21.509 --> 11:24.130
Well then, congrats FUWAMOCO!

11:24.730 --> 11:26.631
And ciao, Ruffians!

11:27.611 --> 11:28.512
BAU BAU!

11:32.203 --> 11:32.783
Cute!

11:33.524 --> 11:34.944
That was kinda nice though.

11:35.024 --> 11:36.445
Are you confused, Nerissa?

11:37.465 --> 11:38.026
What?

11:38.526 --> 11:40.507
Pero's Pero!

11:40.607 --> 11:42.567
He's just a big nasty bomb.

11:42.607 --> 11:43.648
Clap, clap, clap.

11:43.688 --> 11:44.348
Pero!

11:44.928 --> 11:45.829
Hi!

11:46.889 --> 11:47.910
Pero cute!

11:48.230 --> 11:49.330
He was kinda nice.

11:49.430 --> 11:53.632
Not so nasty, like... He wasn't nasty at all today.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.692
That's Saisou.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.553
Exactly, Biboo!

11:56.573 --> 11:57.614
I wasn't thinking that far.

11:57.694 --> 11:58.094
It's okay, bro.

11:58.114 --> 12:00.755
Let's not think that Pero was nasty.

12:05.102 --> 12:05.522
I guess.

12:05.802 --> 12:06.043
Yeah.

12:06.443 --> 12:09.705
Well, I mean, it is episode 100 today.

12:10.045 --> 12:10.406
Yeah.

12:10.706 --> 12:11.646
I guess.

12:12.287 --> 12:15.169
Maybe not so nasty today.

12:17.150 --> 12:17.850
Not today.

12:18.471 --> 12:18.991
Tomorrow.

12:19.011 --> 12:19.852
BAU BAU!

12:19.932 --> 12:29.358
I guess it wouldn't quite be FUWAMOCO Morning without Pero showing up, right?

12:30.219 --> 12:30.499
Maybe.

12:31.961 --> 12:34.582
BAU BAU!

12:34.602 --> 12:38.884
Ruffians, we've had some really good news!

12:39.304 --> 12:51.889
Maybe Doggy Pack, maybe some of you might have noticed a little bit earlier, but FUWAMOCO, we got some new emotes for members of the Doggy Pack!

12:52.109 --> 12:52.569
Yes, we do!

12:52.629 --> 12:53.350
BAU BAU BAU!

12:53.370 --> 12:54.650
Boy, they're so cute!

12:54.670 --> 12:56.631
You can really see them, right?

12:56.811 --> 12:57.431
Yeah, right!

12:57.491 --> 12:58.872
But if you open up the

12:59.532 --> 13:01.214
The emotes, you can see them better maybe.

13:02.255 --> 13:08.582
This time we have the illustrator Old Storm make them for us!

13:08.642 --> 13:10.804
Thank you so much Old Storm!

13:10.884 --> 13:13.107
Thank you!

13:13.307 --> 13:14.328
BAU BAU!

13:14.588 --> 13:16.751
This time they're very convenient.

13:18.272 --> 13:20.273
F-W-M-C letters!

13:20.313 --> 13:23.434
You can use those for FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:23.894 --> 13:24.615
Right!

13:24.755 --> 13:26.375
You can spell things out!

13:26.395 --> 13:29.837
I know, you can even spell M-O-C-O-C-O.

13:29.857 --> 13:31.257
Did I spell my D wrong?

13:31.277 --> 13:33.558
M-O-C-O-C-O.

13:33.978 --> 13:34.239
Yeah!

13:34.319 --> 13:34.619
Mococo!

13:34.639 --> 13:35.139
Yeah!

13:35.419 --> 13:35.799
Is it?

13:36.479 --> 13:36.619
M-O-C-

13:48.346 --> 13:48.686
Mococo.

13:48.706 --> 13:49.187
M-O-C-O-C-O!

13:49.687 --> 13:50.848
C-O-C-O-C-O!

13:50.868 --> 13:51.548
Mocococo!

13:51.568 --> 13:51.648
Yeah!

13:51.668 --> 13:52.428
C-O-C-O-C-O!

13:52.829 --> 13:53.189
Yeah!

13:53.209 --> 13:58.032
You can spell things like that!

14:09.178 --> 14:12.181
But we also have a Kusa Emoji!

14:12.461 --> 14:15.123
And you know FUWAMO and Mococo love big emojis, you know?

14:15.563 --> 14:20.828
So, when we do something silly, like just now, you can laugh along with us!

14:21.128 --> 14:21.328
Yeah!

14:21.348 --> 14:22.529
We're not bad eyes!

14:22.769 --> 14:25.832
Yeah, we also have some PM faces, you know?

14:25.852 --> 14:33.699
Maybe FUWAMOCO, maybe we're getting a little emotional, or needy, or crying again during a watch-along.

14:33.719 --> 14:34.359
No, never!

14:34.599 --> 14:35.020
Right?

14:35.420 --> 14:36.601
And also!

14:37.822 --> 14:40.143
Everyone's favorite!

14:40.183 --> 14:42.204
We have Moco-chan.

14:42.244 --> 14:43.205
Moco-chan!

14:43.505 --> 14:44.446
Moco-chan.

14:44.486 --> 14:45.686
Moco-chan.

14:45.846 --> 14:48.588
Please, um, hoi Mococo.

14:48.668 --> 14:49.428
Hoi!

14:49.728 --> 14:50.009
Hoi!

14:50.569 --> 14:51.109
Hoi!

14:52.110 --> 14:52.390
Hoi!

14:52.750 --> 14:53.170
Hoi!

14:53.711 --> 14:53.931
Hoi!

14:55.177 --> 14:57.420
Y'all, please use the words, okay?

14:57.540 --> 14:58.642
Are you happy?

14:58.722 --> 14:59.903
Are you happy with that?

14:59.923 --> 15:01.645
If you're happy, that's good.

15:01.665 --> 15:03.388
Moco-chan just goes, huh?

15:03.468 --> 15:03.748
Huh?

15:09.730 --> 15:11.091
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

15:11.111 --> 15:11.811
BAU BAU!

15:40.362 --> 15:41.363
It's Moco-chan.

15:41.503 --> 15:46.285
Moco-chan had the best thumbs, so that's why we thought that we'd use Moco-chan's thumbs.

15:46.485 --> 15:47.266
Yes, yes.

15:47.526 --> 15:48.626
I heard thumbs is different.

15:48.967 --> 15:49.707
They're the best!

15:49.887 --> 15:50.728
Gamer thumbs!

15:51.448 --> 15:55.410
Yes, because I really won very well in Mario Party.

15:55.610 --> 15:56.130
Gamer!

15:56.150 --> 15:59.672
Gamer thumbs, yes!

15:59.712 --> 16:04.375
But, unfortunately, Ruffians, you know, we had some bad news earlier.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.837
You know, Ruffians, it's been quite a while.

16:09.857 --> 16:12.338
And I thought we were long past this.

16:12.358 --> 16:15.739
We haven't really had this happening since we got to Japan that much.

16:15.959 --> 16:20.741
But, there's been another misunderstanding.

16:21.962 --> 16:23.262
Yeah.

16:24.603 --> 16:26.363
A big one this time.

16:26.383 --> 16:26.824
But, Nerissa.

16:33.769 --> 16:34.969
It's not our misunderstanding.

16:35.169 --> 16:35.690
It's not mine!

16:35.730 --> 16:38.831
Fuwawa didn't do anything!

16:38.891 --> 16:41.251
Why do you have to say Nerissa?

16:41.351 --> 16:42.352
What's going on?

16:42.552 --> 16:46.313
Everyone seems to think I'm colorblind.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.554
But I'm not colorblind.

16:48.954 --> 16:55.536
I go to the eye doctor regularly and I have to do all sorts of eye tests because I got my eye shot with a laser.

16:57.205 --> 16:58.786
That's amazing.

16:59.106 --> 17:00.547
I have incredible vision.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.348
I've never had any problems at all.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.490
I promise you I'm not colorblind.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.271
Please stop calling me colorblind.

17:06.811 --> 17:07.011
Thanks.

17:07.051 --> 17:12.454
Nerissa, can you repeat that a bit louder for maybe any older Ruffians in the audience?

17:12.475 --> 17:13.415
I'm not colorblind!

17:13.695 --> 17:14.035
Prove it!

17:14.055 --> 17:15.316
No, Nerissa's not colorblind!

17:15.576 --> 17:16.377
I'm not colorblind!

17:16.397 --> 17:17.318
She's not colorblind!

17:17.358 --> 17:17.778
Prove it!

17:18.058 --> 17:18.718
She has good vision.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.139
She's the eye doctor.

17:20.199 --> 17:21.240
I suck but I was wrong.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.862
Yeah, I suck but I was wrong.

17:26.656 --> 17:34.266
What color is my finger right now?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.529
What color is your finger?

17:38.487 --> 17:40.449
She's colorblind!

17:40.489 --> 17:41.590
Wait, okay.

17:41.630 --> 17:45.293
This is a misunderstanding, I'm not colorblind.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.474
Not colorblind.

17:46.554 --> 17:50.337
She did have lasers in her eyes, but she's not colorblind.

17:50.357 --> 17:56.121
Yeah, Nerissa, you know you have your horns, your one and a half horns, and that's pretty cool.

17:56.482 --> 17:57.723
But, not cool.

17:59.850 --> 18:00.911
Lasers are pretty cool.

18:00.971 --> 18:04.833
I love you, Nerissa!

18:05.213 --> 18:09.355
BAU BAU!

18:09.695 --> 18:15.638
There's no new misunderstandings, okay, Ruffians?

18:15.678 --> 18:16.799
No new ones!

18:16.999 --> 18:18.379
On episode 100!

18:18.980 --> 18:20.260
You love her laser eyes?

18:20.280 --> 18:21.521
She's not colorblind.

18:22.021 --> 18:23.262
It's a misunderstanding.

18:24.943 --> 18:25.863
Understood!

18:27.697 --> 18:29.318
BAU BAU!

18:30.359 --> 18:34.142
I am here with us!

18:34.923 --> 18:39.207
There's a little bit of a radiant sparkling sound.

18:39.647 --> 18:40.588
Biboo!

18:41.969 --> 18:42.850
Good news!

18:43.150 --> 18:44.011
You're back in Japan!

18:44.031 --> 18:45.091
If it wasn't obvious.

18:45.172 --> 18:49.075
Biboo you're back!

18:49.355 --> 18:50.216
You're back in Japan!

18:50.256 --> 18:50.696
BAU BAU!

18:50.736 --> 18:51.817
How are you feeling?

18:51.977 --> 18:53.699
A metal pipe fell on my head.

18:54.659 --> 18:55.160
What?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.401
During the bath.

18:57.128 --> 18:58.329
During the bath!

18:58.369 --> 19:00.531
Yeah, during the bath, I just fell on my head.

19:01.172 --> 19:02.073
Oh my gosh.

19:02.453 --> 19:05.416
Oh, was that the pole that you're supposed to hang your clothes up on?

19:05.456 --> 19:06.478
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:06.518 --> 19:07.699
Yeah, that fell on my head.

19:07.779 --> 19:07.899
But...

19:12.982 --> 19:18.848
It just fell and then metal pipe sound effect on my head.

19:19.228 --> 19:22.551
But Biboo, you're a strong rock, right?

19:22.572 --> 19:26.536
I'm a strong rock, but it still hurts.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.578
Hey Baldi, kiss my head right now.

19:28.818 --> 19:29.499
Kiss it, kiss it.

19:29.539 --> 19:29.679
Yay!

19:29.719 --> 19:29.819
BAU!

19:35.698 --> 19:39.242
Maybe Biboo needs to take another bath.

19:39.623 --> 19:44.648
It'll buff out and you'll be shinier than before.

19:44.688 --> 19:48.212
Biboo, now that you're back in Japan, what do you want to do?

19:48.493 --> 19:49.934
What did you miss?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.332
Biboo, you missed us, right?

20:06.652 --> 20:08.293
Yeah, I wanna hang out with everybody.

20:08.313 --> 20:09.434
That's the thing.

20:09.774 --> 20:11.515
I wanna hang out with everybody.

20:11.575 --> 20:14.436
Hey, no, I want you guys to take me places.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.418
Biboo, that's what we've been saying!

20:16.758 --> 20:18.619
You know, we owe you a date.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.980
We're gonna take you.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.202
There's a place that's a secret that we wanna take you.

20:24.302 --> 20:25.022
We decided.

20:25.082 --> 20:25.382
Yeah.

20:27.123 --> 20:31.804
Just for Biboo, not for Shiori and the Abyssgard.

20:31.884 --> 20:33.825
Dive and die!

20:33.865 --> 20:34.605
That's not fair.

20:34.945 --> 20:39.986
And actually, we talked about the long long gummies, right?

20:40.386 --> 20:40.906
Right!

20:41.066 --> 20:42.447
Or that you didn't get me.

20:42.947 --> 20:45.267
Because we were gonna get you a fresh one.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.028
And there was a good reason.

20:47.348 --> 20:51.129
Actually, we left them out in the sun.

20:51.849 --> 20:52.169
Yeah.

20:52.649 --> 20:52.749
And...

20:53.544 --> 20:54.325
They really melted.

20:54.565 --> 20:57.388
Yeah, Nerissa's and Shiori's didn't make it to them.

20:57.408 --> 20:57.488
Yeah.

20:58.469 --> 21:00.631
They really melted, they were just glue.

21:01.351 --> 21:01.852
Why?

21:03.854 --> 21:08.278
It wasn't melted in an appetizing or photogenic way, no.

21:08.298 --> 21:12.882
Yeah, but, you know, the plan was that, okay, we can just get fresh ones.

21:13.703 --> 21:17.166
But... But... They sold out.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.568
We'll fight them!

21:23.648 --> 21:24.989
We'll fight them!

21:25.209 --> 21:27.451
We'll switch Japan for them!

21:27.731 --> 21:29.633
The long long gummies.

21:30.814 --> 21:32.175
We'll buy you one then!

21:35.017 --> 21:39.741
Don't you want to tie your gummies all together and make a big giant advent circle gummies?

21:39.781 --> 21:41.202
That sounds like fun!

21:41.362 --> 21:41.462
What?

21:49.008 --> 21:51.309
We'll find a way to find it done!

21:52.129 --> 21:54.429
But we'll come back to Japan, Biboo!

21:54.489 --> 21:56.030
We're happy!

21:57.130 --> 21:58.670
BAU BAU!

21:59.670 --> 22:01.251
BAU BAU!

22:01.891 --> 22:03.711
Ruffians.

22:04.191 --> 22:08.692
We just want to say, you know, today is FUWAMOCO Morning's 100th episode.

22:09.253 --> 22:14.754
And just thank you so so much for always letting us share your mornings with you.

22:16.174 --> 22:18.255
You know, it's been really fun!

22:18.295 --> 22:20.836
We've had some really silly moments!

22:20.916 --> 22:21.537
Yeah!

22:22.497 --> 22:25.479
But, maybe some things said that they shouldn't have been said!

22:25.499 --> 22:30.261
But, you know, it's also been a bit of a rough journey sometimes.

22:30.301 --> 22:40.726
You know, back in the Northwest Passage, FUWAMOCO- Like Pero mentioned, we wake up at 5am to prepare things, and some days, you know, on the really special FUWAMOCO Mornings,

22:41.366 --> 22:44.609
Sometimes we didn't really even... We didn't sleep at all.

22:44.849 --> 22:47.331
It was just a FUWAMOCO continuation for us.

22:47.631 --> 22:47.831
Yeah.

22:48.031 --> 22:48.432
Yeah.

22:48.652 --> 22:54.116
But, you know... You know, there's been some times that the Barker is just not really working.

22:54.136 --> 22:57.279
You know, maybe we feel a little less fluffy and fuzzy.

22:57.339 --> 23:04.344
But you know, at the end of every morning, we're always so happy that you were there and that we were able to do it.

23:04.364 --> 23:10.529
You know, it started to feel like, Ruffians, you're the one starting off our day on the right.

23:11.221 --> 23:13.663
Thank you, Ruffians!

23:13.703 --> 23:14.724
Thank you!

23:15.285 --> 23:17.327
I don't know, Alvin, do you remember?

23:18.268 --> 23:20.770
Episode 50 of FUWAMOCO Morning!

23:20.870 --> 23:22.371
It was really tough for us.

23:22.452 --> 23:23.653
Right.

23:24.453 --> 23:26.255
What should we do, Alvin?

23:26.295 --> 23:28.437
Should we continue FUWAMOCO Morning?

23:28.537 --> 23:30.879
And we talk to you, and then we're like, okay!

23:31.320 --> 23:32.521
Okay, we're gonna do that!

23:32.841 --> 23:33.982
We're gonna continue.

23:34.202 --> 23:35.584
And then FUWAMOCO flip-flop.

23:36.525 --> 23:40.389
Thank you.

23:40.630 --> 23:44.955
Thank you for always being here to support us and listen to us.

23:45.115 --> 23:50.482
FUWAMOCO's being especially silly and getting ourselves into trouble and mischief.

23:53.040 --> 23:57.203
Thank you!

23:57.223 --> 23:57.503
BAU BAU!

23:58.084 --> 23:59.925
Wow, we thought you know.

24:00.286 --> 24:01.627
It's the 100th episode.

24:01.687 --> 24:03.909
A lot of special mornings spent together.

24:04.029 --> 24:05.049
And Ruffians!

24:05.410 --> 24:07.451
We asked you for your favorite moments.

24:07.471 --> 24:09.193
If you could share those with us.

24:09.373 --> 24:11.575
Thank you!

24:11.875 --> 24:13.596
So today we gathered some of them.

24:14.677 --> 24:16.659
We want to take a little look back at them.

24:16.739 --> 24:17.459
Shall we?

24:17.500 --> 24:18.240
BAU BAU!

24:24.125 --> 24:26.146
Hello, BAU BAU!

24:26.566 --> 24:28.627
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

24:28.647 --> 24:30.468
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

24:30.788 --> 24:31.769
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

24:31.809 --> 24:32.029
Today!

24:32.549 --> 24:33.329
It's a good question.

24:34.130 --> 24:52.218
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

24:53.283 --> 24:55.284
Some of Pero's medical records.

24:55.705 --> 24:57.426
We love cats!

24:57.566 --> 24:57.826
Yes!

24:58.547 --> 25:00.768
Ruffians, do you know much about this place?

25:01.028 --> 25:04.030
You asked if they can live in Moco-chan's bellybutton?

25:04.391 --> 25:07.033
De-den!

25:07.413 --> 25:10.615
I mean, howl, howl, BAU BAU!

25:10.635 --> 25:15.198
There's someone very, very, very important and dear to us.

25:15.498 --> 25:18.140
Pero's stuck in this dog's tummy?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.402
That's not us, but it is us.

25:26.378 --> 25:28.681
Moco-chan, thank you for the drawing.

25:28.741 --> 25:29.122
You're welcome.

25:29.162 --> 25:29.963
Thank you.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.486
It's very good.

25:32.686 --> 25:39.694
No, don't give me the tissue!

25:41.596 --> 25:42.397
No tissue!

25:42.477 --> 25:42.738
Ouchie!

25:44.383 --> 25:46.024
What's the reasoning why it's used, Moco-chan?

25:46.044 --> 25:53.986
Because cat starts with a C. And V starts with a D. This is how she looks all the time.

25:54.406 --> 25:54.726
Right!

25:54.946 --> 25:56.627
Are you using your brain?

25:56.647 --> 25:58.487
You did it!

25:58.607 --> 26:02.189
I did it!

26:02.289 --> 26:04.609
Ruffians, will you forgive me?

26:05.149 --> 26:06.550
Will you forgive her, dude?

26:06.570 --> 26:09.511
Ruffians, would you like me to be your accountant?

26:10.211 --> 26:12.553
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

26:12.593 --> 26:14.014
You wanna do this, right?

26:14.054 --> 26:15.595
You wanna do this!

26:31.187 --> 26:32.188
I wanna do this!

26:32.368 --> 26:33.149
Okay!

26:33.169 --> 26:33.149
3, 2, 1!

26:33.890 --> 26:36.092
I wanna do it!

26:36.152 --> 26:36.712
Don't stop!

26:36.892 --> 26:37.173
Don't!

26:37.333 --> 26:37.573
Don't!

26:37.693 --> 26:37.973
Don't!

26:38.034 --> 26:39.415
Don't stop!

26:39.955 --> 26:43.819
Take care of me!

26:43.839 --> 26:45.300
Extreme violence!

26:46.400 --> 26:47.581
It's just violence!

26:48.502 --> 26:52.966
It's just that, Moco-chan!

26:53.847 --> 26:55.528
I believe you'll be all okay!

26:55.948 --> 26:57.229
Let's do it together, okay?

26:57.990 --> 26:59.351
Stay strong!

26:59.912 --> 27:01.233
Business as usual.

27:01.573 --> 27:05.937
Ruffians keep on muttering strange things like, business as usual.

27:06.698 --> 27:08.920
Even if sometimes no one else notices it!

27:09.600 --> 27:13.124
What's important is that you recognize all your hard work.

27:13.724 --> 27:16.928
Moco-chan's chair is REVISED!

27:17.368 --> 27:17.749
Yeah!

27:17.869 --> 27:19.030
Rocking tea!

27:19.310 --> 27:19.831
New e-rolls!

27:19.911 --> 27:22.574
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

27:22.634 --> 27:24.876
BAU BAU!

27:25.397 --> 27:26.618
FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:27.559 --> 27:31.944
It was planned to be every single day of the work week.

27:32.847 --> 27:38.190
Second cover song is... De-den!

27:38.250 --> 27:41.171
Cute na Kanoja!

27:41.251 --> 27:43.212
BAU BAU!

27:44.073 --> 27:44.913
I know you can do it.

27:45.533 --> 27:49.035
Let's try to groom from every mistake and not let them take us down.

27:49.355 --> 28:00.741
It was a nice afternoon, and then suddenly, from right in front of us and out of nowhere, a grizzly bear started running towards us like a bull, so we're like... No!

28:02.602 --> 28:02.762
Water!

28:02.782 --> 28:02.962
Water!

28:03.002 --> 28:03.162
Water!

28:03.182 --> 28:03.303

28:03.323 --> 28:03.443

28:03.463 --> 28:03.623

28:03.643 --> 28:03.743

28:03.763 --> 28:03.903

28:03.923 --> 28:04.063

28:04.624 --> 28:04.844

28:04.884 --> 28:05.004

28:05.024 --> 28:05.184

28:05.204 --> 28:05.644

28:05.664 --> 28:05.784

28:05.824 --> 28:06.025

28:06.065 --> 28:06.185

28:06.205 --> 28:06.305

28:06.345 --> 28:06.485

28:06.525 --> 28:06.665

28:06.685 --> 28:06.785

28:06.825 --> 28:06.985

28:07.005 --> 28:07.145

28:07.206 --> 28:07.346

28:07.366 --> 28:07.466

28:07.486 --> 28:07.586

28:07.906 --> 28:08.086

28:08.106 --> 28:08.206

28:08.226 --> 28:08.346
Water!

28:08.366 --> 28:08.466

28:24.058 --> 28:24.179

28:24.599 --> 28:24.719

Water!

28:27.001 --> 28:27.101
Water!

28:27.850 --> 28:32.873
Kept on touching the monitor multiple, multiple times repeatedly.

28:33.354 --> 28:42.360
This weekend, there's definitely one place you'll be able to find us, and that place is... New York City!

28:42.460 --> 28:43.701
BAU BAU!

28:43.841 --> 28:44.441
BAU BAU!

28:44.821 --> 28:46.202
It's me, Pero.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.945
As you can see, Ruffians, I'm on my vacation.

28:50.545 --> 28:55.249
You've decided to erase Nerissa's name and put yours on it?

28:55.269 --> 28:56.770
Huh?

28:56.850 --> 28:58.892
What are you doing?

28:59.172 --> 29:00.954
What are you doing?

29:01.014 --> 29:01.634
Blubbers!

29:01.694 --> 29:03.175
You remember, right?

29:03.276 --> 29:03.676
Right!

29:03.796 --> 29:12.143
One level in particular is very strong at counting, has been counting every time we say BAU BAU since our debut.

29:13.021 --> 29:17.864
We reached our goal of a certain amount of Ruffians subscribed to our channel.

29:18.525 --> 29:21.026
Mama Puppy will leak our guest appearance!

29:21.086 --> 29:24.128
We hit 300,000 followers on Twitter!

29:24.188 --> 29:27.150
Thank you, Ruffians!

29:27.210 --> 29:28.992
Thank you!

29:29.152 --> 29:30.293
FUWAMOCO Scoop!

29:31.473 --> 29:36.577
Yeah, for anything, you know, you see something interesting or silly going on, we want to know about it!

29:36.597 --> 29:38.178
You want to know, let us know!

29:38.778 --> 29:40.039
I'm Perroccino!

29:40.699 --> 29:41.740
And I'm strong!

29:41.860 --> 29:42.281
Yeah!

29:43.484 --> 29:45.886
You better not doubt it or I'll rough you up!

29:56.917 --> 29:58.258
I did it!

29:58.418 --> 30:01.520
It was all over my lips, but I really did not like that!

30:01.561 --> 30:04.302
We'll have to have a toad off later.

30:04.723 --> 30:05.323
Toad off!

30:05.363 --> 30:05.823
Oh yeah!

30:05.883 --> 30:15.970
There was a very cute Moco-chan cosplay spotted on TV in the Philippines too!

30:28.955 --> 30:32.196
Come on, don't make a pain face.

30:32.717 --> 30:35.078
Don't worry, don't sweat the small stuff.

30:35.438 --> 30:37.338
And you know what?

30:37.358 --> 30:37.999
You'll be okay.

30:41.977 --> 30:44.440
Yikes.

30:44.900 --> 30:48.664
I really didn't realize that you're that kind of dog, Moco-chan.

30:48.724 --> 30:50.565
I was just trying to be a good imposter.

30:50.866 --> 30:54.089
New outfit!

30:54.209 --> 30:54.810
BAU BAU!

30:54.830 --> 30:56.091
Good morning, money puppies!

30:56.111 --> 30:56.791
I was.

30:57.432 --> 30:58.413
I wasn't.

31:06.604 --> 31:07.925
That sounded suspicious.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.669
I kept on hearing Nerissa laughing.

31:12.810 --> 31:18.075
I wake up to her laughing.

31:19.837 --> 31:23.980
Look at that.

31:24.581 --> 31:25.081
Yeah.

31:25.102 --> 31:26.543
She's trying to steal it.

31:26.603 --> 31:27.424
BAU BAU.

31:27.684 --> 31:31.708
Pushing yourself hard to do something that you don't want to do isn't always the right answer.

31:33.134 --> 31:36.036
You have to think of the importance of the journey, not just the destination, okay?

31:36.056 --> 31:37.356
There was some intense discussion about... ...my fuzziness.

31:37.376 --> 31:37.757
That's you, Ruffian!

31:37.837 --> 31:38.097
It's you!

31:38.117 --> 31:38.337
It's you!

31:38.357 --> 31:38.597
It's you!

31:38.617 --> 31:38.917
It's you!

31:38.937 --> 31:39.097
It's you!

31:39.117 --> 31:39.277
It's you!

31:39.337 --> 31:39.618
It's you!

31:39.658 --> 31:42.039
It's you!

31:42.079 --> 31:42.279
It's you!

31:42.299 --> 31:42.479
It's you!

31:42.499 --> 31:42.679
It's you!

31:42.699 --> 31:42.919
It's you!

31:42.940 --> 31:43.100
It's you!

31:43.120 --> 31:43.680
It's you!

31:43.700 --> 31:43.860
It's you!

31:43.880 --> 31:44.040
It's you!

31:44.060 --> 31:44.380
It's you!

31:44.400 --> 31:44.600
It's you!

31:44.620 --> 31:44.821
It's you!

31:44.841 --> 31:45.041
It's you!

31:45.061 --> 31:45.221
It's you!

31:45.241 --> 31:45.401
It's you!

31:45.421 --> 31:45.581
It's you!

31:45.601 --> 31:45.941
It's you!

31:45.961 --> 31:46.121
It's you!

31:46.141 --> 31:46.301
It's you!

31:46.321 --> 31:46.481
It's you!

31:46.501 --> 31:46.682
It's you!

31:46.702 --> 31:46.882
It's you!

31:46.902 --> 31:47.162
It's you!

31:47.182 --> 31:47.342
It's you!

31:47.362 --> 31:47.522
It's you!

31:47.542 --> 31:47.782
It's you!

31:47.802 --> 31:48.082
It's you!

31:48.102 --> 31:48.262
It's you!

31:48.282 --> 31:48.443
It's you!

31:48.463 --> 31:48.743
It's you!

31:48.763 --> 31:49.143
It's you!

31:49.163 --> 31:49.363
It's you!

31:49.383 --> 31:49.543
It's you!

31:49.563 --> 31:49.723
It's you!

31:49.743 --> 31:49.963
It's you!

31:49.983 --> 31:50.144
It's you!

31:50.164 --> 31:50.324
It's you!

31:50.344 --> 31:50.504
It's you!

31:50.524 --> 31:50.704
It's you!

31:50.724 --> 31:50.784
It

31:53.391 --> 31:58.894
Moco-chan's almost at a total of 200 on-stream sneezes!

31:58.934 --> 32:04.096
The other night, I had a dream about our mamas!

32:04.276 --> 32:07.518
Both Mama Puppy and Icomochi-mama!

32:08.018 --> 32:10.660
Even though not many people might recognize their efforts.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.884
I know that in your heart, you're doing it.

32:15.745 --> 32:17.127
And I do too, okay?

32:18.068 --> 32:19.950
Together with Ino-senpai!

32:19.970 --> 32:20.671
Senpai!

32:21.232 --> 32:22.213
Ino-senpai!

32:22.753 --> 32:27.419
It's been five months since the Doggy Pack formed and our membership opened!

32:28.200 --> 32:31.364
But if it falls onto me, I will be in my grave earlier than...

32:34.056 --> 32:36.537
Your mom loves you very much.

32:37.118 --> 32:40.519
Mama puppy can bark quickly with some hungry kicks.

32:40.780 --> 32:43.201
BAU BAU!

32:43.281 --> 32:45.242
What do you think, Ruffians?

32:45.502 --> 32:51.545
If FUWAMOCO is your oshi, then actually you have three oshi.

32:51.845 --> 32:55.667
Fuwawa, Mococo, and FUWAMOCO!

32:57.408 --> 32:59.871
I'm a proper demon dog, okay?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.014
Don't misunderstand.

33:02.374 --> 33:08.921
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

33:15.097 --> 33:15.998
Oh my goodness.

33:17.218 --> 33:18.959
Marine-senchou-senpai!

33:18.999 --> 33:21.481
Do us an illustration!

33:21.541 --> 33:22.921
Just for us!

33:23.101 --> 33:24.762
Just for us, okay?

33:24.962 --> 33:29.865
Make sure today you let those that matter to you know that they matter.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.266
Marshmallow mania.

33:33.067 --> 33:34.248
Yeah.

33:34.348 --> 33:37.769
Yeah, it's hard to tell what exactly it is.

33:37.809 --> 33:41.852
Thank you for always being here to have so much fun with us, Ruffians.

33:47.614 --> 33:52.256
You're resilient, so don't be scared of things and challenge yourself.

33:52.996 --> 33:59.798
And even if maybe things don't go exactly as you imagined, you'll end somewhere new and filled with possibilities.

34:00.418 --> 34:07.226
The past month or so, we've actually been in Japan moving into our new dog house!

34:07.466 --> 34:09.889
She was so cute and fluffy looking!

34:09.929 --> 34:15.035
She was so cute and she just popped out from the corner of the door frame and was like, FUWAMOCO-CHAN!

34:15.695 --> 34:25.961
If you click on it on FUWAMOCO there, you can hear many different BAU BAUs.

34:26.021 --> 34:32.745
We want to share a special FUWAMOCOland with you at the end of each stream.

34:32.945 --> 34:36.767
hololive onee-chan, she's made an unexpected new friend!

34:38.328 --> 34:39.529
Funny and ugly.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.951
And that's why his name is the FUG one.

34:42.251 --> 34:43.191
Mayo Chuchu.

34:44.052 --> 34:46.714
Chuchu giving kisses to the mayonnaise too.

34:46.754 --> 34:49.796
You got MVP too, right?

34:49.916 --> 34:50.276
I did!

34:50.336 --> 34:52.238
A different kind of MVP though.

34:52.318 --> 34:53.018
I got...

34:59.673 --> 35:02.835
Most Captured!

35:03.335 --> 35:04.376
I believe in you!

35:04.456 --> 35:07.238
So do your best, okay?

35:08.238 --> 35:10.340
I'm cheering for you!

35:10.940 --> 35:11.681
Huh?

35:13.282 --> 35:14.562
Why did you poke me?

35:16.143 --> 35:17.484
What are you doing?

35:17.744 --> 35:21.607
Us, FUWAMOCO, we have an official rival.

35:21.627 --> 35:23.428
Kevin Lamar.

35:24.028 --> 35:26.470
That's Fubuzu and I guess

35:27.205 --> 35:29.046
The Great Perroccino.

35:29.286 --> 35:32.709
We've been on ad checks going around Taipei!

35:32.749 --> 35:36.191
You can hear us BAU BAUing from the streets, Ruffians!

35:37.012 --> 35:40.354
Over 850,000 YouTube subscribers!

35:40.374 --> 35:42.075
850,000 Ruffians, right!

35:42.115 --> 35:43.136
BAU BAU!

35:43.156 --> 35:44.136
Such a big milestone!

35:48.319 --> 35:50.100
Please have fun!

35:50.540 --> 35:52.801
Yeah, for the first time in person!

35:52.821 --> 35:57.023
Oh my goodness, she was so excited!

35:57.423 --> 36:06.527
She picked me up into a big hug and spun me around and around and around and then she covered me with so much strength into a wall!

36:06.547 --> 36:11.950
There's so many places with such a long list of things we want to do together with our

36:12.150 --> 36:12.470
BAU BAU!

36:42.503 --> 36:48.416
Thank you for 100 episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:48.436 --> 36:49.538
BAU BAU!

36:53.553 --> 36:57.434
BAU BAU!

36:57.954 --> 37:01.115
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

37:01.135 --> 37:02.416
100 episodes over!

37:02.436 --> 37:03.696
Good morning!

37:03.936 --> 37:05.317
BAU BAU!

37:05.857 --> 37:12.119
Hopefully, very, very many more, as long as you let us spend your morning with you!

37:12.239 --> 37:12.499
BAU BAU!

37:16.961 --> 37:17.402
BAU!

37:17.702 --> 37:18.242
But!

37:18.683 --> 37:19.123
But!

37:19.143 --> 37:19.203
But!

37:19.624 --> 37:23.827
Right now, we get to spend a bunch of time together with Advent!

37:23.847 --> 37:31.373
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-

37:46.417 --> 37:52.279
And you know, there's already been so many exciting things that's been announced, right?

37:52.419 --> 37:55.220
One, FUWAMOCO's 3D debut this summer!

38:09.105 --> 38:12.367
You know Breaking Dimensions, New York City?

38:12.407 --> 38:15.530
Today is, as you know, our first anniversary.

38:15.670 --> 38:17.231
It's only in a month and a bit.

38:17.251 --> 38:17.431
Right.

38:17.551 --> 38:18.011
What?

38:18.091 --> 38:18.272
Really?

38:18.352 --> 38:18.772
Yeah!

38:18.812 --> 38:22.014
Only a month and a bit, people!

38:22.034 --> 38:22.234
Right!

38:22.374 --> 38:24.896
We had so many exciting things.

38:25.016 --> 38:26.177
Yeah.

38:26.277 --> 38:33.322
And also what's really exciting is that we're all here in this room today together!

38:33.742 --> 38:33.983
Yay!

38:34.143 --> 38:34.863
Thank you.

38:35.284 --> 38:35.744
Yeah.

38:36.604 --> 38:43.506
That's not the only time we'll be in the same room together this week, right?

38:44.147 --> 38:44.627
Right.

38:45.067 --> 38:46.447
Yeah, maybe.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.848
Because, well, there's a good reason.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.549
No, no, no!

38:51.669 --> 38:53.089
No, Shiori, don't!

38:53.129 --> 38:59.231
We'll be having two advent collabs on the weekend!

39:03.750 --> 39:07.312
You know, we've been doing all the collabs together pretty much weekly, right?

39:07.352 --> 39:09.113
Right, since we debuted!

39:09.574 --> 39:13.957
And usually we have our set time, but this time it's a little different.

39:14.117 --> 39:17.560
It's two hours later than our usual time.

39:17.580 --> 39:20.301
So pay attention!

39:20.622 --> 39:22.783
And I feel like, you know, there's been so much excitement!

39:22.863 --> 39:25.725
Sometimes you can be like, I can't handle all this excitement!

39:25.785 --> 39:26.746
I need to take a break!

39:26.766 --> 39:29.168
Are you tired of the excitement, Adventrix?

39:29.648 --> 39:31.290
No way!

39:31.530 --> 39:34.954
If you kinda feel like that, are you sleepy now?

39:35.014 --> 39:36.316
You don't want excitement?

39:36.456 --> 39:36.876
No!

39:36.957 --> 39:39.680
You can't miss this, okay?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.463
You'll have to be here for sure, okay?

39:44.665 --> 39:47.346
We still haven't really quite decided things, right?

39:47.566 --> 39:47.807
No.

39:48.327 --> 39:51.068
But it's gonna be a fun time for sure, okay?

39:51.108 --> 39:52.249
Two days in a row!

39:52.269 --> 39:54.150
Two days!

39:54.190 --> 39:59.912
So please, I know it's not far off, but make sure you mark it in your schedule for this week, okay?

40:00.052 --> 40:00.192
Okay!

40:00.513 --> 40:00.933
Yeah.

40:01.093 --> 40:01.333
Yeah.

40:02.025 --> 40:02.505
Got it.

40:02.546 --> 40:02.966
Got it.

40:02.986 --> 40:05.288
Thumbs up, you understand.

40:05.308 --> 40:06.790
Understood.

40:06.890 --> 40:07.991
No misunderstandings.

40:08.551 --> 40:09.392
Yeah!

40:10.193 --> 40:10.854
Good, good.

40:10.914 --> 40:13.196
Your thumbs work well for putting things in the schedule.

40:13.816 --> 40:14.077
BAU BAU!

40:14.097 --> 40:19.342
We're excited to see you there!

40:21.152 --> 40:22.433
Wow!

40:23.434 --> 40:29.618
It's the 100th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning that just happens to be at the beginning of the week!

40:30.038 --> 40:37.124
And you know the start of a new week means that it's the perfect time to challenge yourself to something new, right Moco-chan?

40:37.164 --> 40:39.125
You know this very well, right?

40:39.545 --> 40:46.850
Yeah, that's because almost every new week since FUWAMOCO Morning started, Moco-chan's been challenging herself

40:47.591 --> 40:49.412
To overcome something she dislikes.

40:50.093 --> 40:51.394
Which is natto!

40:52.634 --> 40:54.095
And, Moco-chan, how has it been going?

40:54.155 --> 40:55.396
Especially recently, huh?

40:55.516 --> 40:56.257
It's been good.

40:56.657 --> 40:58.078
Ruffians, has it been good?

40:58.098 --> 41:00.019
I've been doing well.

41:00.780 --> 41:01.841
Lots of progress.

41:03.234 --> 41:09.198
Just today, you know, it's a very special 100th episode.

41:09.238 --> 41:12.801
Advent, you know, you're here together with us.

41:12.821 --> 41:13.822
I thought you know.

41:24.970 --> 41:27.032
If maybe... Don't finish that sentence.

41:27.192 --> 41:31.075
All of you guys just want to have some natto together.

41:31.115 --> 41:34.238
Maybe Moco-chan, you can graduate from the natto challenge.

41:34.298 --> 41:36.200
It's better if we do it together, right?

41:36.520 --> 41:36.800
Right?

41:36.920 --> 41:37.581
Friendship.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.262
Friends together doing something.

41:39.382 --> 41:40.603
Overcoming something.

41:40.803 --> 41:41.784
Maybe difficult.

41:41.804 --> 41:43.526
Can I go back to jail?

41:43.846 --> 41:44.186
No!

41:45.227 --> 41:45.828
No jail.

41:45.848 --> 41:46.969
You can't escape the natto.

41:46.989 --> 41:49.150
They can be jailed.

41:49.371 --> 41:50.632
They can be jailed in natto.

41:51.986 --> 41:52.906
I am not Nobita-chan!

41:53.006 --> 41:53.406
Nobita-chan!

41:53.426 --> 41:53.907
Nobita-chan!

41:53.927 --> 41:54.507
Nobita-chan!

41:54.527 --> 41:55.027
Nobita-chan!

41:55.107 --> 41:55.447
Nobita-chan!

41:55.467 --> 41:55.947
Nobita-chan!

41:56.027 --> 41:56.567
Nobita-chan!

41:56.587 --> 41:56.847
Nobita-chan!

41:56.867 --> 41:57.187
Nobita-chan!

41:57.207 --> 41:58.248
Nobita-chan!

41:58.268 --> 41:58.628
Nobita-chan!

41:58.648 --> 41:58.888
Nobita-chan!

41:59.428 --> 42:00.908
Nobita-chan!

42:01.028 --> 42:01.488
Nobita-chan!

42:01.508 --> 42:02.089
Nobita-chan!

42:02.109 --> 42:03.149
Nobita-chan!

42:03.169 --> 42:03.769
Nobita-chan!

42:03.829 --> 42:04.369
Nobita-chan!

42:04.409 --> 42:05.069
Nobita-chan!

42:05.089 --> 42:05.750
Nobita-chan!

42:05.770 --> 42:06.390
Nobita-chan!

42:06.750 --> 42:07.070
Nobita-chan!

42:07.090 --> 42:07.510
Nobita-chan!

42:07.570 --> 42:08.090
Nobita-chan!

42:08.230 --> 42:08.710
Nobita-chan!

42:09.230 --> 42:09.651
Nobita-chan!

42:09.691 --> 42:10.031
Nobita-chan!

42:10.051 --> 42:10.311
Nobita-chan!

42:10.331 --> 42:10.791
Nobita-chan!

42:10.811 --> 42:11.091
Nobita-chan!

42:11.151 --> 42:11.691
Nobita-chan!

42:11.731 --> 42:12.171
Nobita-chan!

42:12.211 --> 42:12.651
Nobita-chan!

42:12.671 --> 42:13.211
Nobita-chan!

42:14.012 --> 42:14.392
Nobita-chan!

42:14.412 --> 42:14.812
Nobita-chan

42:16.178 --> 42:18.540
That's what Moco-chan says every time!

42:18.620 --> 42:19.900
It doesn't work, Nerissa!

42:19.980 --> 42:21.822
It doesn't work!

42:23.363 --> 42:25.584
What if I say I'll pad it better after?

42:25.644 --> 42:27.905
That won't save me from having it come back.

42:31.334 --> 42:37.098
Okay, well, first, Shiori, Biboo, Nerissa, Moco-chan.

42:37.118 --> 42:48.526
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Canada and the United States of America who worked hard to make this natural.

42:50.253 --> 42:52.915
It's from Canada and the United States of America.

42:54.376 --> 42:56.137
The beans are from there, I think.

42:56.257 --> 42:56.738
Yeah.

42:57.118 --> 42:59.780
I don't know what they made in that, though.

42:59.800 --> 42:59.840
No!

43:00.500 --> 43:01.681
Okay, Advent!

43:02.281 --> 43:02.782
Advent!

43:02.802 --> 43:04.823
Itadakimasu!

43:04.923 --> 43:05.023
No!

43:05.123 --> 43:06.144
Itadakimasen!

43:06.224 --> 43:07.205
Itadakimasu!

43:07.645 --> 43:08.726
Itadakimasu!

43:08.906 --> 43:12.489
Okay, Shiori said it the loudest, so pass it over to Shiori!

43:13.229 --> 43:14.410
Shiori, please.

43:14.450 --> 43:16.792
Please don't drop it.

43:21.290 --> 43:25.134
Oh, oh, oh, she has... How many beads is that?

43:25.174 --> 43:25.934
Shiori!

43:25.995 --> 43:27.076
Don't fake it!

43:27.156 --> 43:30.739
Don't fake it, Shiori!

43:31.039 --> 43:32.280
Why?

43:33.922 --> 43:36.724
Don't drop it!

43:37.305 --> 43:37.585
No!

43:39.547 --> 43:40.548
Oh, you loved it?

43:41.068 --> 43:45.832
Oh, if you loved it, then Nerissa will love it because Nerissa loves Shiori too!

43:48.599 --> 43:49.600
It's stinky.

43:49.660 --> 43:49.800
It is.

44:05.808 --> 44:06.388
Hi!

44:06.549 --> 44:08.670
That's what Moco-chan says every morning.

44:08.750 --> 44:09.110
Really?

44:09.150 --> 44:09.611
The both of you?

44:09.631 --> 44:10.211
Really?

44:10.271 --> 44:10.851
Oh my, Biboo!

44:10.871 --> 44:11.092
Biboo!

44:11.112 --> 44:11.292
Biboo!

44:11.312 --> 44:11.492

44:27.322 --> 44:28.263

44:28.343 --> 44:28.683

44:28.703 --> 44:28.843

44:28.863 --> 44:29.043

44:29.504 --> 44:29.664
Biboo!

44:29.684 --> 44:29.904
Biboo!

44:29.924 --> 44:30.104
Biboo!

44:30.144 --> 44:30.644
Biboo!

44:30.664 --> 44:30.824
Biboo!

44:31.865 --> 44:32.245
Biboo!

44:32.265 --> 44:32.746
Biboo!

44:32.806 --> 44:33.246
Biboo!

44:33.306 --> 44:33.546
Biboo!

44:33.566 --> 44:33.846
Biboo!

44:33.866 --> 44:34.147
Biboo!

44:34.207 --> 44:34.487
Biboo!

44:34.527 --> 44:34.707
Biboo!

44:42.275 --> 44:42.716
Help!

44:42.736 --> 44:43.297
Biboo!

44:43.818 --> 44:44.619
Biboo!

44:45.220 --> 44:46.743
That's a lot of Biboo!

44:47.684 --> 44:52.492
Biboo you need to do it!

44:52.532 --> 44:53.594
We don't have tissue.

44:55.962 --> 44:56.242
Biboo!

45:16.315 --> 45:17.717
Biboo did well.

45:19.700 --> 45:20.501
I'll take it.

45:20.821 --> 45:21.923
Biboo drink the water.

45:22.003 --> 45:24.266
Biboo is drunk for every 200.

45:24.687 --> 45:29.373
Biboo's a gamer when it comes to real life too though.

45:29.814 --> 45:32.137
That was like 10 beans just now.

45:32.157 --> 45:32.758
Do you have candy?

45:33.398 --> 45:36.582
I have a cough drop!

45:37.343 --> 45:38.525
It saves me so much!

45:38.685 --> 45:39.185
Wow!

45:39.205 --> 45:43.050
I'm so proud of Biboo!

45:43.110 --> 45:47.655
More proud than I've ever been of Moco-chan ever!

45:48.296 --> 45:49.858
Biboo strong!

45:49.918 --> 45:50.559
Yeah!

45:53.221 --> 45:53.981
Okay, Moco-chan!

45:54.602 --> 46:00.363
I won't let everyone beat me at Mario Party and then... Biboo at the natto challenge?

46:00.383 --> 46:02.004
Why do they smell so strong?

46:02.384 --> 46:03.144
Moco-chan!

46:03.164 --> 46:05.185
That's one bean you gotta hurry up!

46:05.505 --> 46:06.325
That's a bad thing!

46:06.365 --> 46:08.106
That's Shiori and Nerissa, okay?

46:08.126 --> 46:08.946
It can't be!

46:08.966 --> 46:11.266
Biboo just took a mouthful of it!

46:11.467 --> 46:12.627
She didn't eat her!

46:13.027 --> 46:13.927
Nobody said!

46:13.947 --> 46:18.209
I'm just not hoping I'm natto by myself already.

46:18.269 --> 46:19.469
You did today, though.

46:22.314 --> 46:23.855
I don't have a stomach either.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.438
I see the tummy right there, though.

46:27.598 --> 46:28.759
Okay, Moco-chan.

46:28.939 --> 46:30.500
Mococo is in danger.

46:30.520 --> 46:30.760
Yes!

46:31.561 --> 46:32.342
Okay!

46:32.362 --> 46:32.342
3, 2, 1!

46:33.583 --> 46:37.566
It's on the tongue?

46:38.126 --> 46:39.427
It's a- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

46:42.149 --> 46:43.470
Yeah, you're right!

46:43.490 --> 46:45.172
Right, there was a lot of Ruffians.

46:45.312 --> 46:46.093
I did it.

46:46.393 --> 46:46.773
I did it.

46:46.833 --> 46:48.374
Okay, then you can do the rest, Moco-chan.

46:50.020 --> 46:50.240
What?!

46:50.340 --> 46:55.382
Okay, one... There's a string to my lip!

46:55.442 --> 46:56.323
I can see it, it's shiny.

46:56.383 --> 46:59.324
Just take a big ol' scoop.

46:59.784 --> 47:02.005
Yeah, a big ol' scoop just like Biboo did.

47:02.045 --> 47:02.906
I just scooped it.

47:02.926 --> 47:03.826
Do you want me to do the same?

47:03.886 --> 47:05.106
I can do the same.

47:05.187 --> 47:06.427
I can feed you, Moco-chan.

47:06.447 --> 47:06.947
I can feed you.

47:06.987 --> 47:09.428
Do you want me to feed you, baby Moco-chan?

47:09.708 --> 47:10.309
I'm done.

47:10.389 --> 47:10.989
I'm done with this.

47:11.069 --> 47:12.290
I have one bean.

47:12.410 --> 47:15.111
Well, you know what the conclusion is then, Moco-chan.

47:20.094 --> 47:21.415
Shiori, how could you say that?

47:21.435 --> 47:21.935
How could you say that?

47:21.955 --> 47:22.516
How could you say that?

47:22.536 --> 47:23.276
How could you say that?

47:23.296 --> 47:24.157
How could you say that?

47:24.237 --> 47:25.158
How could you say that?

47:25.178 --> 47:25.698
How could you say that?

47:25.718 --> 47:26.219
How could you say that?

47:26.239 --> 47:26.979
How could you say that?

47:26.999 --> 47:27.780
How could you say that?

47:27.840 --> 47:28.460
How could you say that?

47:28.540 --> 47:29.181
How could you say that?

47:29.201 --> 47:30.082
How could you say that?

47:30.122 --> 47:30.742
How could you say that?

47:30.802 --> 47:31.943
How could you say that?

47:31.963 --> 47:32.544
How could you say that?

47:32.564 --> 47:33.084
How could you say that?

47:33.144 --> 47:33.664
How could you say that?

47:33.684 --> 47:34.265
How could you say that?

47:34.325 --> 47:35.065
How could you say that?

47:35.085 --> 47:35.686
How could you say that?

47:35.706 --> 47:36.827
How could you say that?

47:36.847 --> 47:37.647
How could you say that?

47:37.707 --> 47:38.508
How could you say that?

47:38.528 --> 47:39.269
How could you say that?

47:39.349 --> 47:40.089
How could you say that?

47:40.109 --> 47:40.950
How could you say that?

47:40.990 --> 47:41.690
How could you say that?

47:41.791 --> 47:42.591
How could you say that?

47:42.651 --> 47:43.412
How could you say that?

47:43.432 --> 47:44.072
How could you say that?

47:44.132 --> 47:44.873
How could you say that?

47:44.893 --> 47:46.014
How could you say that?

47:46.034 --> 47:46.694
How could you say that?

47:46.714 --> 47:47.415
How could you say that?

47:47.475 --> 47:48.316
How could you say that?

47:48.336 --> 47:48.916
How could you say

47:49.924 --> 48:02.410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:02.930 --> 48:07.372
There is like a natto that's more small, like a chopped up natto.

48:07.712 --> 48:17.097
Apparently that's easier to eat, but Moco-chan really refuses that one too, so... Wow, Moco-chan!

48:18.166 --> 48:21.807
I didn't eat it all together with Alvin, so... I did well, though.

48:22.908 --> 48:23.828
Ruffians!

48:24.088 --> 48:25.389
I did the best, right?

48:25.409 --> 48:26.509
Did you?

48:26.989 --> 48:27.929
I did the best!

48:28.089 --> 48:28.790
Biboo did the best!

48:28.810 --> 48:29.250
I did the best!

48:29.270 --> 48:29.890
Biboo did the best!

48:29.990 --> 48:31.331
I did the best!

48:31.471 --> 48:32.251
I did the best!

48:32.271 --> 48:39.894
She didn't complain, she didn't scream, she didn't go... Like you used to do, Biboo was just like... She said weh a lot.

48:40.274 --> 48:41.394
Yeah, not like you said.

48:41.834 --> 48:42.054
Weh.

48:45.252 --> 48:47.814
Congratulations, Bau Bau-chan!

48:47.954 --> 48:50.396
Well, I think you're still gonna have to try your best.

48:51.317 --> 48:52.538
Ruffians!

48:52.658 --> 48:56.300
You know, you saw Albert do the best of this challenge.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.562
Does it make you feel like you want to challenge something new?

48:58.602 --> 48:59.803
Maybe something you're scared of?

48:59.823 --> 49:03.446
Make sure you're like Shiori!

49:03.566 --> 49:08.149
You do your best, you don't go... You can't let your best go to waste!

49:08.269 --> 49:10.931
It's a new week!

49:11.291 --> 49:12.192
Do your best!

49:12.292 --> 49:13.013
BAU BAU!

49:14.833 --> 49:15.734
De-den!

49:31.761 --> 49:35.384
Why aren't you sharing your doggies with us?

49:51.704 --> 49:52.085
Yo!

49:52.345 --> 49:56.768
I was gonna say, does this mean... It's your dogs!

49:57.389 --> 49:58.129
Excuse me.

49:58.710 --> 50:00.671
Demon dogs, okay?

50:00.691 --> 50:01.132
Yeah!

50:01.292 --> 50:01.912
All of us!

50:02.133 --> 50:02.833
All of us!

50:03.293 --> 50:04.915
We are demon guide dogs!

50:04.975 --> 50:06.756
We protect your smile!

50:06.776 --> 50:08.858
I think you are Ruffians.

50:09.378 --> 50:10.839
Without you, okay?

50:11.279 --> 50:12.460
Don't get it mistaken.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.782
BAU BAU!

50:14.942 --> 50:20.125
Advent, how do we BAU BAU?

50:20.225 --> 50:21.867
How does FUWAMOCO BAU BAU?

50:21.887 --> 50:27.851
BAU BAU!

50:27.911 --> 50:30.292
That's pretty good, Biboo, but Nerissa, did you try your best?

50:30.692 --> 50:32.554
BAU BAU!

50:33.014 --> 50:33.835
Oh, that was better.

50:33.855 --> 50:34.915
Shiori!

50:37.508 --> 50:37.849
What?

50:37.989 --> 50:40.370
Okay, maybe that's Fuwawa with the voice changer.

50:48.276 --> 50:49.777
What would you rate us?

50:49.797 --> 50:51.218
10 out of 10.

50:51.398 --> 50:52.058
11 out of 10.

50:52.959 --> 50:53.459
20 out of 10.

50:53.580 --> 50:54.200
100 out of 10.

50:54.240 --> 50:54.540
100 out of 10.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.502
BAU BAU out of 10.

50:56.542 --> 50:57.863
Numbers don't mean anything.

50:57.943 --> 51:02.526
Like, fluffy and fuzzy, like you'd pat us every day of the day.

51:02.586 --> 51:05.248
The fluffiest.

51:05.268 --> 51:05.428
Mococo.

51:06.549 --> 51:07.770
I already knew that.

51:08.371 --> 51:10.252
Ruffians, what about you?

51:10.272 --> 51:10.632
10,000 out of 10!

51:10.672 --> 51:11.333
BAU BAU!

51:23.828 --> 51:28.329
Okay, well, this is embarrassing, so... Today I went on a walk!

51:28.610 --> 51:32.111
Ruffians, we've been going for walks for hours, touching the paws.

51:32.611 --> 51:36.032
Let's see... De-den!

51:36.052 --> 51:38.312
You can't really see it that well, huh?

51:38.472 --> 51:40.893
An adventure in the city this time, maybe?

51:40.913 --> 51:46.295
Oh, you found some graffiti that reminds me of Moco-chan!

51:47.815 --> 51:48.215
It says... No.

51:48.235 --> 51:48.275
No.

51:53.607 --> 51:54.288
No!

51:55.609 --> 51:56.009
No!

51:56.810 --> 51:57.270
No!

51:57.330 --> 51:57.670
No!

51:57.891 --> 51:58.391
No!

51:58.411 --> 52:01.334
Moco-chan doesn't say no like that!

52:01.414 --> 52:02.875
No, I don't say it like that.

52:02.895 --> 52:03.736
I say it... No way!

52:04.356 --> 52:06.558
No way to say it like that!

52:06.638 --> 52:07.599
No way to say it!

52:07.899 --> 52:08.419
No!

52:10.421 --> 52:10.902
No!

52:11.522 --> 52:12.103
No!

52:12.343 --> 52:12.923
No!

52:14.204 --> 52:15.325
That sounds annoying.

52:16.604 --> 52:16.964
Moco-chan.

52:17.224 --> 52:18.184
Moco-chan's not annoying.

52:18.644 --> 52:19.645
I'm not annoying.

52:19.905 --> 52:21.165
You're not annoying yo.

52:21.185 --> 52:23.025
Mococo!

52:23.145 --> 52:25.126
BAU BAU!

52:25.146 --> 52:29.266
I'm not annoying, I'm Mococo!

52:29.466 --> 52:30.127
Exactly.

52:30.147 --> 52:30.907
That's annoying.

52:31.027 --> 52:32.367
BAU BAU!

52:33.627 --> 52:39.788
Well, let's see what we have for the Question of the Day today.

52:40.088 --> 52:43.329
For the Question of the Day, we have...

52:43.973 --> 52:46.075
De-den!

52:46.155 --> 52:46.916
Finally!

52:46.936 --> 52:46.916
100!

52:46.956 --> 52:59.010
I know you both have asked what our favorite moments from FUWAMOCO Morning are, but do you two have any episodes or preparations for them that were super memorable?

52:59.030 --> 53:01.593
Any other big plans for the show beyond 100?

53:04.255 --> 53:09.199
I know a lot of our favorite moments, Ruffians, were your favorite moments too.

53:09.399 --> 53:10.079
Makes sense.

53:10.179 --> 53:11.200
It makes sense.

53:11.540 --> 53:17.144
But one of mine, I think Nerissa, do you remember your apology corner?

53:17.624 --> 53:18.585
Misunderstanding?

53:18.625 --> 53:20.386
Misunderstanding, I know.

53:20.406 --> 53:25.229
I think I had the most out of unacknowledging you guys.

53:27.589 --> 53:37.438
Yeah... Yeah, that's not a good... But you know... Shiori, Biboo, have you had any misunderstandings you haven't told us about?

53:37.458 --> 53:40.821
Or did you solve them without FUWAMOCO Morning?

53:41.361 --> 53:42.482
I guess that's helpful.

53:42.662 --> 53:42.842
Yeah...

53:47.608 --> 53:48.728
That's probably for the best.

53:48.888 --> 53:49.249
Yeah.

53:50.529 --> 53:52.610
And then, I guess, other memorable moments!

53:53.130 --> 53:57.131
You know, the FUWAMOCO Mornings that we worked all through the night for, you know.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.632
The ones we were really worried about.

53:58.652 --> 53:58.732
Yeah.

53:58.752 --> 54:05.274
The ones where we were like... Before, you know, we were gonna... Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

54:05.914 --> 54:09.596
Especially the pilot right after it debuted, you know.

54:10.376 --> 54:14.438
Been talking to Mama Puppy right after it because it's so busy!

54:14.458 --> 54:17.580
And we're finally going to sleep and like, we debuted!

54:17.620 --> 54:19.822
FUWAMOCO Morning!

54:20.262 --> 54:28.346
I mean, just like, all the, you know, there's the good times and there's also like the rough times, you know, where maybe we doubted ourselves.

54:28.647 --> 54:31.208
But we're really worried about a lot of stuff.

54:31.949 --> 54:35.370
But now, this one!

54:35.931 --> 54:39.373
This is one of our favorite FUWAMOCO Mornings.

54:40.213 --> 54:41.975
Thank you!

54:42.175 --> 54:45.378
BAU BAU!

54:45.498 --> 54:47.500
We love you too!

54:47.680 --> 54:50.142
BAU BAU!

54:50.703 --> 55:00.492
Well, Ruffians, we just wanna say thank you so much for always being here and sharing bits of yourselves with us every single FUWAMOCO Morning!

55:01.172 --> 55:05.694
You know, we hope that you'll continue to open up yourself lots to us.

55:05.934 --> 55:07.695
Spend your mornings with us.

55:07.955 --> 55:09.855
Send us your Pero Sightings.

55:09.915 --> 55:11.456
Let us into your lives a bit, okay?

55:11.856 --> 55:15.337
Any photos of the funny things you notice on your daily walks.

55:15.718 --> 55:18.859
Maybe any questions you can think up for us.

55:19.239 --> 55:21.480
And of course, your doggy of the days.

55:21.540 --> 55:24.481
We want to know which doggy is of your day.

55:24.721 --> 55:26.102
You want to see Pero more?

55:27.742 --> 55:29.363
It's episode 100, Ruffians.

55:31.431 --> 55:33.676
We're always waiting for your tweets, Ruffians!

55:33.957 --> 55:34.718
You know where!

55:34.738 --> 55:35.600
At... Hashtag!

55:36.242 --> 55:37.023
Hashtag!

55:37.244 --> 55:37.845
FWMCMORNING!

55:38.226 --> 55:38.707
BAU BAU!

55:44.552 --> 55:50.994
And for our next stream, we have... De-den!

55:51.854 --> 55:56.995
We're gonna be playing Jump Box Games together with Calli-senpai and hololive!

55:57.015 --> 56:01.096
BAU BAU will be over on Calli-senpai's channel!

56:01.116 --> 56:03.596
Who knows who's gonna participate?

56:03.756 --> 56:05.417
FUWAMOCO will be there!

56:05.437 --> 56:05.537
Biboo!

56:07.626 --> 56:08.387
Hi!

56:08.447 --> 56:08.888
I'll be there.

56:08.968 --> 56:10.069
You'll be there?

56:10.129 --> 56:10.971
We'll see though.
