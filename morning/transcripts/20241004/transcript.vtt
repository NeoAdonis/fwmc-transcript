05:13.264 --> 05:15.146
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:16.027 --> 05:19.110
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:19.130 --> 05:25.076
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:25.897 --> 05:28.659
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:29.080 --> 05:31.602
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:31.902 --> 05:34.345
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:37.687 --> 05:41.929
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.989 --> 05:44.150
Thank you!

05:44.210 --> 05:45.110
Ruffians!

05:45.570 --> 05:47.011
Are you awake?

05:47.031 --> 05:49.892
Yeah, you're awake?

05:50.872 --> 05:51.633
Good morning!

05:51.673 --> 05:56.715
Thank you Ruffians for waking us- Waking us up?

05:56.795 --> 06:00.076
Waking up and joining us for our 131st episode today!

06:05.412 --> 06:26.179
FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-FUWA-F

06:37.086 --> 06:38.867
Do you know what the next part is?

06:40.288 --> 06:41.228
Moco-chan.

06:41.328 --> 06:42.849
I'm asking them!

06:44.249 --> 06:44.710
Huh?

06:45.790 --> 06:46.891
BAU BAU.

06:48.552 --> 06:49.572
Not left paw.

06:50.533 --> 06:51.273
Is that a hashtag?

06:51.373 --> 06:55.115
No, that's not the FWMCMORNING information!

06:55.155 --> 07:02.138
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

07:02.198 --> 07:03.159
What's the hashtag?

07:04.539 --> 07:05.780
I forgot, Moco-chan.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.181
Use the hashtag.

07:13.342 --> 07:13.743
Yes!

07:14.023 --> 07:16.525
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:16.605 --> 07:20.708
Let's uh... Fill in the blank.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.630
This is the FUWAMOCO Morning.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.511
We get the Ruffians to answer.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.372
Let's uh...

07:30.534 --> 07:36.498
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:37.139 --> 07:38.980
BAU BAU!

07:39.740 --> 07:42.362
That was much easier than usual, Hamoco-chan.

07:42.882 --> 07:45.384
Yeah, because the Ruffians helped us out, right?

07:45.584 --> 07:46.605
They'd be stuck otherwise.

07:46.625 --> 07:46.845
Really?

07:46.865 --> 07:48.766
I don't think so.

07:48.826 --> 07:49.147
BAU BAU!

07:59.099 --> 08:01.641
FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:02.142 --> 08:03.323
Ruffians!

08:04.203 --> 08:07.426
We hope that it hasn't been too rough of a weekend.

08:07.927 --> 08:10.849
It's gonna be a really fun weekend too!

08:11.550 --> 08:13.591
I'm ready Ruffians!

08:14.212 --> 08:15.113
BAU BAU!

08:15.193 --> 08:16.454
But first!

08:16.494 --> 08:17.695
Disappointment!

08:17.955 --> 08:19.376
Disappointment?

08:19.396 --> 08:22.619
I don't want anymore of that.

08:23.460 --> 08:24.280
Disappointment time.

08:24.300 --> 08:24.380
Guys!

08:27.752 --> 08:32.738
There's been another Pero Sighting.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.183
Where was he seen this time, Moco-chan?

08:37.263 --> 08:39.505
Is there anything we can do to stop it?

08:39.826 --> 08:46.213
Well, I don't think there's anything we can do to stop it because it's important to know, but let's take a look.

08:51.047 --> 08:51.227
Oh!

08:52.308 --> 08:52.468
Oh!

08:53.389 --> 08:55.711
This is a great Pero Sighting!

08:56.472 --> 08:57.532
Yeah!

08:58.273 --> 08:58.733
Yeah?

08:59.094 --> 08:59.454
Right!

08:59.534 --> 09:01.736
No nasty Pero in view at all!

09:01.756 --> 09:01.916
Right?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.918
It's just a beautiful little place in Italy!

09:05.099 --> 09:06.179
Right!

09:06.520 --> 09:07.320
Well, I don't know.

09:07.420 --> 09:11.023
I don't think Pero would ever be caught in a place like this, right?

09:11.043 --> 09:11.984
I don't know.

09:12.184 --> 09:12.765
Right?

09:14.024 --> 09:14.464
I don't know.

09:15.105 --> 09:17.966
Do you want to live in Pero?

09:18.647 --> 09:21.749
I'm sure Pero is a beautiful place, but maybe he's visiting.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.690
Yeah.

09:23.710 --> 09:28.753
I don't know, maybe he could be hanging out somewhere else instead.

09:29.173 --> 09:29.513
Maybe.

09:29.533 --> 09:34.176
How about BAU BAU in Indonesia?

09:35.456 --> 09:37.157
I feel like it'd be strange if you know.

09:37.177 --> 09:42.320
It'd be easy to be quiet if you're in a place that is your name, you know?

09:42.681 --> 09:43.201
Why not?

09:44.168 --> 09:48.550
Yeah... It's not his city!

09:48.630 --> 09:51.912
But, BAU BAU, I'd like to visit BAU BAU!

09:51.972 --> 09:53.092
Yeah, I think I'd too!

09:53.112 --> 09:55.553
Yeah, but only if Pero isn't there.

09:55.573 --> 09:55.814
True.

09:56.254 --> 09:58.875
Yeah... We're not going searching for him, okay?

09:58.935 --> 10:00.116
Don't misunderstand!

10:00.536 --> 10:03.297
Yeah, you know, if Pero's there, it's gonna be nasty.

10:03.317 --> 10:06.879
I wanna see BAU BAU at it's most beautiful!

10:06.899 --> 10:06.979
Yeah!

10:07.559 --> 10:10.741
Yeah... As you know, I got a BAU BAU.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.062
And then... You know what we do next?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.502
Wait, BAU BAU wants some BAU BAU!

10:16.283 --> 10:18.646
BAU BAU wants!

10:19.126 --> 10:20.127
I quit!

10:20.648 --> 10:21.869
I quit!

10:25.353 --> 10:28.998
I don't know what to say!

10:29.018 --> 10:33.043
But then you're scared of maybe saying the same thing as me at the same time?

10:34.395 --> 10:36.478
I understand that feeling, huh?

10:36.538 --> 10:38.060
Yeah, we couldn't do that, huh?

10:38.200 --> 10:38.500
No.

10:38.901 --> 10:39.401
Yeah.

10:39.842 --> 10:40.523
BAU BAU!

10:40.583 --> 10:45.869
Yeah, it's funny how Pero is shaped like Pero, though.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.781
I think it would be.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.582
It's good like that.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.605
BAU BAU!

10:52.965 --> 10:54.426
FUWAMOCO!

10:54.867 --> 11:00.612
It's a new month and that means there's a new voice pack!

11:00.672 --> 11:04.415
We have the Halloween voice pack!

11:04.435 --> 11:06.977
It is October after all.

11:07.718 --> 11:11.321
And this time it's Halloween with villains.

11:12.793 --> 11:15.055
Villains.

11:15.155 --> 11:16.757
Yeah, FUWAMOCO.

11:17.758 --> 11:22.443
You know, we're both FUWAMOCO, but this time we're a little bit evil.

11:24.743 --> 11:25.964
Maybe just a tiny bit.

11:26.384 --> 11:32.390
Ruffians, have you had a chance to check the Melody Unit?

11:32.470 --> 11:36.353
If you haven't, please go over to the official hololive shop.

11:36.373 --> 11:40.316
There's some voice previews that you can check out.

11:40.797 --> 11:44.820
And maybe you can check out just how evil FUWAMOCO has become.

11:45.701 --> 11:47.262
Elizabeth is a villain!

11:47.843 --> 11:48.923
We're all villains!

11:51.240 --> 11:52.020
Yeah.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.061
It's not evil, it's just cute.

11:56.121 --> 11:59.821
Fuwawa's as evil as usual.

12:01.082 --> 12:03.202
Are you saying that I'm evil all the time?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.703
Are you saying that I'm not very evil when I'm supposed to be evil?

12:06.743 --> 12:09.183
I'm a villain.

12:09.383 --> 12:11.083
What about Mococo?

12:12.644 --> 12:14.784
BAU BAU.

12:15.764 --> 12:16.524
Yeah.

12:16.544 --> 12:20.125
Hopefully it'll put you in a spooky

12:21.343 --> 12:23.024
And a fluffy and fuzzy mood!

12:23.364 --> 12:23.764
Yo!

12:23.884 --> 12:24.504
Yeah!

12:24.584 --> 12:30.046
Yeah, but I think you know it's definitely a little less scary than the extreme love voice part.

12:30.186 --> 12:30.446
Right.

12:30.887 --> 12:36.689
So, if you want a cute and a unique way to celebrate Halloween, we recommend it!

12:37.069 --> 12:39.550
You know, this time it's extra silly.

12:39.970 --> 12:43.211
Ruffians, you know how much we love pon-de-rings.

12:43.992 --> 12:49.013
And now too, you know when there's something that we love, we want you to love it too.

12:49.113 --> 12:50.354
This time I especially

12:50.754 --> 12:56.400
What you are pondering the door is lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.744
I'm doing my best to be evil.

13:00.024 --> 13:01.266
So I need your support.

13:02.058 --> 13:02.558
Got it!

13:03.118 --> 13:07.919
So please go have a listen!

13:08.039 --> 13:10.600
You know, it's a nice way to get in the Halloween mood.

13:10.800 --> 13:16.261
Especially early on in this month, or maybe you want to save it until later.

13:16.281 --> 13:20.102
Putting extra special video maybe on Halloween night as well.

13:20.142 --> 13:24.242
Please check it out, okay?

13:24.362 --> 13:26.363
BAU BAU!

13:27.983 --> 13:28.564
And next!

13:29.044 --> 13:37.971
Well, there's been a lot of exciting big things happening in hololive English, but another one just happened!

13:37.991 --> 13:42.214
40 Senpai, she's hit a huge, huge, huge milestone!

13:42.554 --> 13:46.777
She just reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

13:46.837 --> 13:48.198
BAU BAU!

13:48.258 --> 13:50.240
Congratulations!

13:50.740 --> 13:51.720
FUWAMOCO!

13:51.740 --> 13:52.781
Congratulations!

13:52.841 --> 13:54.801
That's pretty cool!

13:54.841 --> 14:02.903
I can't wait to see what she's gonna do today!

14:16.007 --> 14:17.449
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

14:34.817 --> 14:37.479
Just a few more pages and that'll be 1 million pages.

14:37.599 --> 14:38.160
Right!

14:38.420 --> 14:39.161
Right!

14:39.681 --> 14:41.043
That's amazing!

14:41.183 --> 14:42.083
Amazing!

14:42.244 --> 14:42.824
Yeah!

14:42.884 --> 14:45.166
You can really feel all the love!

14:45.186 --> 14:46.888
Yeah!

14:47.368 --> 14:49.490
But again, congratulations!

14:49.550 --> 14:50.391
Congratulations!

14:50.851 --> 14:54.735
I feel like I wanna almost get cronies sent by headpats too.

14:54.795 --> 14:55.435
Or a hug.

14:55.756 --> 14:55.956
Yeah.

14:57.217 --> 15:00.099
And then she can give us a massage.

15:00.159 --> 15:02.600
Moco-chan, you're just thinking of more massages!

15:02.960 --> 15:06.343
I was just thinking, after a hug, maybe it'll be nice.

15:07.423 --> 15:09.405
BAU BAU!

15:10.245 --> 15:12.087
I see some Ruffians here.

15:12.427 --> 15:21.633
FUWAMOCO, you may be getting close to... We're doing our best!

15:21.733 --> 15:24.395
I don't know Ruffians!

15:29.281 --> 15:32.503
Let's do our best!

15:33.704 --> 15:39.328
And let's have a lot of fun until maybe it's our turn for a big milestone.

15:39.869 --> 15:40.329
Maybe.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.611
BAU BAU!

15:48.686 --> 15:52.471
There's some other big things happening too.

15:52.831 --> 15:57.017
And you know, something that we really really like and always look forward to.

15:57.798 --> 16:02.224
We have some senpai with some 3D lives coming out!

16:04.187 --> 16:12.397
Well, the clock just turned midnight in Japan, which means it's officially Fubuki-senpai's birthday now!

16:12.637 --> 16:14.599
BAU BAU!

16:14.679 --> 16:20.887
And to celebrate it, Fubuki-senpai is having a birthday party live entitled

16:21.227 --> 16:22.508
Fubu Kingdom!

16:22.668 --> 16:23.849
Fubu Kingdom!

16:24.269 --> 16:24.770
Prologue!

16:24.990 --> 16:25.110
Yes!

16:25.651 --> 16:26.852
And it's on the 5th!

16:27.512 --> 16:29.594
At 5AMP- 4AM!

16:30.094 --> 16:30.574
4AMPT!

16:30.895 --> 16:31.395
Yes!

16:32.436 --> 16:34.217
4AMPT or 8PM GST.

16:34.378 --> 16:37.740
And the theme is FUBU KINGDOM!

16:37.800 --> 16:38.261
Nice!

16:38.461 --> 16:41.083
I'm wondering just what kind of kingdom it's gonna be.

16:41.123 --> 16:41.823
Very nice.

16:42.304 --> 16:44.586
What kind of kingdom will she be showing us around in?

16:44.866 --> 16:47.748
What kind of friends will be there waiting for us, huh?

16:47.888 --> 16:48.749
Definitely the best.

16:49.069 --> 16:54.432
Happy birthday FUWAMOCO!

16:54.532 --> 16:55.393
FUWAMOCO!

16:55.433 --> 16:57.113
So that's really soon, so check it out, okay?

16:57.153 --> 16:58.854
Really soon, yeah!

16:59.315 --> 17:07.659
But shortly after that, FUWAMOCO will be having her 4th anniversary 3D Lifetime Mirage!

17:07.919 --> 17:09.360
Mirage!

17:09.380 --> 17:11.021
Yeah, sound extra special.

17:11.659 --> 17:20.684
And that's gonna be on the 5th at 5PM KT, about 12 hours difference, right?

17:20.884 --> 17:23.485
Or the 6th at 9AM JST!

17:23.605 --> 17:26.426
Very very soon too!

17:26.486 --> 17:28.467
Yeah, very soon, you know.

17:28.487 --> 17:32.309
Shiori-senpai just kind of shared some of the guest stuff.

17:32.369 --> 17:34.250
Maybe a bit of a sample.

17:34.330 --> 17:36.171
I know there's some horns there.

17:36.851 --> 17:45.334
Yeah, I think Nerissa mentioned that she's gonna be one of the guests here at Kiara-senpai's live here.

17:45.914 --> 17:54.256
Yeah, so you'll have to make sure to set your clothes ready to check out what kind of mirage Kiara-senpai has waiting for us.

17:54.857 --> 17:55.737
What could they sing?

17:56.617 --> 17:58.678
They could sing so many things together!

17:58.698 --> 17:59.578
I'm so excited!

18:00.771 --> 18:01.232
Yay!

18:01.252 --> 18:01.312
Yay!

18:01.912 --> 18:03.352
Good for Nerissa!

18:03.392 --> 18:03.993
Yay!

18:04.033 --> 18:04.873
Yay!

18:05.053 --> 18:08.795
And a happy 4th anniversary to Kiara-senpai!

18:08.815 --> 18:08.875
Yay!

18:09.615 --> 18:09.935
But!

18:10.355 --> 18:11.016
That's not it!

18:11.056 --> 18:12.156
Let's not just stop there!

18:12.216 --> 18:14.077
Let's not wait!

18:14.217 --> 18:14.817
Stop!

18:14.857 --> 18:17.719
FUWAMOCO's hololive ID we have already set!

18:17.819 --> 18:18.539
Yay!

18:18.939 --> 18:21.460
It's gonna be her birthday live too!

18:21.700 --> 18:25.042
Her very first CD birthday live!

18:25.062 --> 18:25.962
I can't believe it!

18:26.082 --> 18:26.302
Yeah!

18:27.823 --> 18:33.987
She's also gonna be showcasing her new 3D outfit that she used her million wish on!

18:34.387 --> 18:34.768
Really?

18:34.908 --> 18:35.308
Yeah right!

18:35.348 --> 18:35.929
That's crazy!

18:36.742 --> 18:55.104
And there'll be other friends joining her as well. So I'm really excited. It's not gonna be too long until then too so. Let's look forward to it and make sure you know. That we're there to support all our senpais.

18:55.161 --> 18:55.261
Yay

18:56.322 --> 18:58.823
You know how big a birthday 3D Live is?

18:59.083 --> 18:59.763
It's a really big deal!

18:59.783 --> 19:01.364
It's a big deal, okay?

19:01.424 --> 19:04.325
Lots of process and hard work goes into it.

19:04.365 --> 19:04.445
Yes!

19:04.605 --> 19:04.845
Yes!

19:04.965 --> 19:05.065
Yes!

19:05.205 --> 19:14.208
We really hope that you'll be there to support everybody and to celebrate, you know, whether it's their birthday, anniversary, or just, you know, another day.

19:14.689 --> 19:16.069
It's a big celebration!

19:16.209 --> 19:17.530
A big 3D Live!

19:18.310 --> 19:19.550
I'm so excited.

19:19.650 --> 19:22.371
I wanna be able to see how they're gonna perform.

19:22.451 --> 19:22.752
Yeah!

19:24.112 --> 19:25.936
What kind of always so much new outfit?

19:26.037 --> 19:27.059
Why excited?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.161
Rebirth?

19:28.562 --> 19:28.763
Huh?

19:28.783 --> 19:30.046
What kind of always so much new outfit?

19:30.086 --> 19:30.727
She's enjoying me!

19:33.637 --> 19:36.459
BAU BAU!

19:37.300 --> 19:39.481
Yeah, exciting, right?

19:39.501 --> 19:42.123
We have lots of great stuff coming up.

19:42.524 --> 19:45.286
But it doesn't just stop there!

19:45.426 --> 19:47.628
We have Biboo!

19:47.988 --> 19:49.930
hololive English -Advent- aura.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.171
Beautiful sparkling gem.

19:52.672 --> 19:54.813
Koseki Bijou.

19:55.134 --> 19:59.537
She's been kind of teasing something over on her Twitter.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.580
And I think it's something really big.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.422
Look here, Ruffians!

20:04.542 --> 20:09.106
What and who are all these magical girls here?

20:09.166 --> 20:12.109
Who could it be?

20:12.129 --> 20:17.513
Green, blue, dark blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.735
Like a rainbow.

20:19.755 --> 20:22.198
Shiny.

20:23.038 --> 20:24.940
Shiny, sparkly.

20:26.161 --> 20:26.722
Pretty cute.

20:28.543 --> 20:30.173
I don't know why.

20:32.770 --> 20:33.770
It's not a salad.

20:34.210 --> 20:34.511
No.

20:34.751 --> 20:35.371
Salad?

20:35.531 --> 20:36.471
It's not a salad.

20:37.011 --> 20:38.671
It's at least a fruit bowl.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.232
It's not delicious leaves, okay?

20:42.552 --> 20:50.353
But Biboo, she's mentioning you know she's gonna be doing an archive karaoke stream on the 6th at 4pm PT.

20:50.493 --> 20:54.454
And that will be leading into this big announcement!

20:54.614 --> 20:58.715
At 6pm PT or 10am JST on the 7th.

20:58.775 --> 21:00.655
So please be there!

21:01.575 --> 21:02.916
Don't miss it, okay?

21:02.996 --> 21:05.478
We're so excited, I can't wait!

21:05.498 --> 21:08.059
Mococo must be hungry.

21:09.500 --> 21:09.900
No.

21:10.281 --> 21:13.042
Ruffians, I think that's your problem.

21:13.322 --> 21:15.123
You still haven't had breakfast, okay?

21:15.163 --> 21:16.144
Go have breakfast.

21:16.184 --> 21:17.205
Go have fun.

21:17.225 --> 21:20.307
Breakfast, okay, Ruffians?

21:21.467 --> 21:24.569
Don't miss Biboo's big announcement!

21:25.770 --> 21:27.951
BAU BAU!

21:32.915 --> 21:34.276
BAU BAU!

21:34.897 --> 21:43.184
Over on the JP side of things, Mikoji-senpai!

21:43.444 --> 21:52.572
Just a few hours earlier she was doing a stream where she made a sheet of her family relationships to other hololive members!

21:52.592 --> 21:53.834
Let's take a look!

21:55.500 --> 21:56.921
FUWAMOCO!

21:56.961 --> 21:57.922
We'll be her pets!

22:21.111 --> 22:21.471
Yes!

22:21.651 --> 22:23.734
We're demon dogs!

22:23.914 --> 22:28.139
We can't be Mikuchi-senpai's pets!

22:28.159 --> 22:29.420
What's wrong with that?

22:29.581 --> 22:31.423
It is Mikuchi-senpai time.

22:32.500 --> 22:32.700
Hi.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.821
I can be Mikocchi-senpai's pet.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.821
Yes!

22:36.041 --> 22:38.882
You know she said she'd scold us when we do bad things.

22:39.222 --> 22:40.483
We do bad things, Ruffians!

22:40.543 --> 22:42.043
We don't do bad things.

22:42.103 --> 22:43.163
Bad things.

22:43.303 --> 22:43.544
What?

22:43.824 --> 22:45.164
She wouldn't say mad at us.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.805
Oh my god.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.646
Don't be scary and mad, Mikocchi-senpai.

22:52.106 --> 22:54.407
Oh actually, what kind of bad things should we do?

22:55.666 --> 22:56.648
I want to test her.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.672
She talked about it, but I don't want to mention that yet.

22:59.972 --> 23:03.117
We will do both kind of bad things.

23:03.137 --> 23:03.177
No!

23:03.577 --> 23:03.618
No!

23:03.638 --> 23:03.998
No!

23:04.058 --> 23:04.859
No!

23:04.959 --> 23:05.380
No.

23:05.400 --> 23:05.440
No.

23:05.460 --> 23:05.500
No.

23:06.081 --> 23:06.622
No.

23:12.866 --> 23:16.127
We had a chill on Mikocchi-senpai.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.568
What part should we chill on?

23:17.920 --> 23:28.743
But you know, I sort of feel like her mom is part of the dog family. Dad's part of the dog family.

23:33.994 --> 23:34.034
Ah

23:35.032 --> 23:38.514
Shouldn't we be more like her little tiny sisters or something?

23:38.714 --> 23:38.955
Why?

23:39.035 --> 23:41.216
It looks like there's a lot of dogs in her family.

23:41.276 --> 23:41.816
Yeah!

23:41.956 --> 23:43.437
Or onee-chan!

23:43.497 --> 23:44.998
You know, Korone-senpai!

23:45.038 --> 23:46.079
Korone-senpai!

23:46.759 --> 23:47.140
Huh?

23:47.240 --> 23:49.241
Why is it dogs as her pets, huh?

23:49.421 --> 23:53.363
Her parents are dogs, her sisters are dogs, and her pets are dogs.

23:53.924 --> 23:54.304
Huh?

23:55.345 --> 23:56.465
Something is fishy.

23:58.026 --> 23:58.727
And doggy.

24:01.569 --> 24:05.052
But you know, she also said that she wanted to clean out our ears!

24:05.613 --> 24:06.333
Which works well!

24:06.353 --> 24:10.717
Because we wanted to always get our ears cleaned professionally in Japan!

24:10.737 --> 24:21.086
Yeah, that's what a lot of fathers and fathers... You know, it'd be exuberant, but... Getting them cleaned by Winkochi-san, but... Is that not unprofessional?

24:24.528 --> 24:31.551
But, you know, Rikuchi-senpai's gonna clean our ears off, and that means... It doesn't count as touching the ears, okay?

24:31.831 --> 24:32.611
Love pillow!

24:32.631 --> 24:33.011
Take it!

24:33.051 --> 24:33.692
Love pillow!

24:33.732 --> 24:34.252
Love pillow!

24:34.312 --> 24:35.072
Love pillow!

24:35.112 --> 24:37.713
Love pillow from Rikuchi-senpai.

24:37.793 --> 24:39.454
It's not touching the ears, okay?

24:39.834 --> 24:41.495
It's cleaning them.

24:41.675 --> 24:42.535
It's different.

24:42.555 --> 24:46.917
Cleaning is not touching.

24:48.311 --> 24:50.693
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:11.833 --> 25:15.275
And I'm sure that she'll give us lots of pon-de-rings, right?

25:15.295 --> 25:15.896
Treats!

25:15.996 --> 25:19.438
Treats could be good, yeah!

25:19.618 --> 25:20.039
BAU BAU!

25:20.079 --> 25:21.440
We'll even send Mia for her, too.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.200
Yeah!

25:23.461 --> 25:25.383
Wouldn't that make us more cat-like?

25:27.544 --> 25:30.487
Well, Mikocchi-senpai knows she'll give us good pon-de-rings.

25:32.392 --> 25:35.935
Do not touch the ears!

25:35.975 --> 25:37.776
Do not touch the ears!

25:37.796 --> 25:41.859
Cleaning is different.

25:42.039 --> 25:42.460
It's different.

25:42.480 --> 25:42.980
Different touch.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.299
BAU BAU!

25:58.779 --> 25:59.380
Wow!

25:59.620 --> 26:01.161
Also my Doggie of the Day!

26:01.181 --> 26:01.221
Yo!

26:01.241 --> 26:02.662
Let's check out today's Doggie of the Day!

26:02.722 --> 26:05.303
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

26:05.323 --> 26:05.544
Naichuu!

26:05.564 --> 26:05.684
Wow!

26:05.704 --> 26:05.824
Wow!

26:05.844 --> 26:05.964
Wow!

26:06.004 --> 26:21.934
What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a...

26:22.414 --> 26:27.816
Wow, and look there's a very happy looking eel coming on back there.

26:27.916 --> 26:30.417
Yeah, I'm probably swishing back and forth.

26:30.437 --> 26:31.157
You're not happy?

26:31.258 --> 26:31.998
I'm happy!

26:32.058 --> 26:34.579
You're just like any good Doggie of the Day.

26:34.599 --> 26:35.699
A big cheek!

26:36.039 --> 26:40.161
Yeah, the big cheek's the one that poked that, wasn't you?

26:40.781 --> 26:42.002
Very, very cute.

26:42.082 --> 26:43.882
Not bad, wasn't you?

26:43.922 --> 26:46.403
No, no, no, no, no!

26:46.423 --> 26:46.704
Yeah.

26:46.744 --> 26:47.644
Very cute.

26:47.904 --> 26:49.845
Very good Doggie of the Day.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.947
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm BAU BAU.

26:53.207 --> 26:53.988
BAU BAU.

26:54.008 --> 26:55.930
BAU BAU.

26:55.970 --> 26:56.610
BAU BAU.

26:57.831 --> 26:58.472
BAU BAU.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.110
FUWAMOCO!

27:13.130 --> 27:14.190
It's a bit different.

27:14.510 --> 27:17.811
You know there's lots of doggies out there.

27:17.831 --> 27:18.931
FUWAMOCO.

27:19.032 --> 27:25.133
FUWAMOCO loves to be chased around lots and lots until it gets all tuckered out and then loves to be carried.

27:25.173 --> 27:26.414
Wow, what a baby.

27:27.274 --> 27:29.075
I am FUWAMOCO!

27:29.095 --> 27:30.235
Moco-chan, are we ready?

27:30.275 --> 27:31.655
Are we ready to do that job?

27:31.675 --> 27:32.876
FUWAMOCO!

27:32.896 --> 27:33.396
Yeah!

27:33.456 --> 27:39.518
You know we'll chase and chase FUWAMOCO and then I think you know we're gonna take him away forever.

27:40.031 --> 27:41.015
Whatever!

27:41.115 --> 27:41.175
Yum.

27:46.405 --> 27:49.866
That was very cute, doggy!

27:49.926 --> 27:50.926
Night tour!

27:51.106 --> 27:54.007
Bye bye!

27:54.047 --> 27:57.208
FUWAMOCO Abyss!

27:57.408 --> 28:01.029
Even though the season's changing, it's getting a little bit cooler.

28:01.049 --> 28:05.070
You're still getting those paws outside hitting the pavement, right?

28:05.890 --> 28:07.911
Let's check out what we went on today!

28:07.991 --> 28:09.011
I went on a walk!

28:09.571 --> 28:12.352
We have... De-den!

28:12.412 --> 28:14.853
The Aria Plus

28:15.073 --> 28:19.737
Fubuki-senpai and Mio-senpai and your whole club!

28:19.797 --> 28:27.044
We're so happy we're able to get out and enjoy the Aniplex cafe that's happening in Singapore right now!

28:27.404 --> 28:31.628
There's so many exciting things going on in Singapore!

28:31.648 --> 28:35.172
These club cafes are always such a bunch of fun!

28:40.270 --> 28:42.532
And we hope that you had a really good time.

28:42.572 --> 28:46.296
Maybe you're able to get your paws on some treasure too.

28:46.756 --> 28:49.359
I'd say it's a very successful walk there.

28:49.499 --> 28:50.540
Meet with some friends!

28:53.342 --> 28:56.365
Maybe you're able to give some head pats there.

28:57.326 --> 28:58.327
I definitely do so.

29:00.335 --> 29:01.115
BAU BAU!

29:01.215 --> 29:05.578
I'm glad you got up for a good time.

29:05.638 --> 29:06.878
BAU BAU!

29:07.799 --> 29:11.620
Wow, next we have our Question of the Day.

29:11.721 --> 29:15.502
Our Question of the Day is the best!

29:15.843 --> 29:17.944
FUWAMOCO!

29:18.504 --> 29:25.387
I guess I never really thought about it, but is there a reason you don't swear or use a vulgar language?

29:25.907 --> 29:26.728
Do you hold yourself?

29:28.473 --> 29:29.794
You're so bad.

29:30.334 --> 29:32.896
Why is it just not in your nature?

29:32.916 --> 29:35.939
I like and respect that you both don't do it.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.421
BAU BAU!

29:38.521 --> 29:41.523
You know, that's just not FUWAMOCO.

29:41.543 --> 29:43.585
It's just, we're not like that.

29:43.765 --> 29:44.265
We've never been.

29:44.305 --> 29:46.567
We're not that kind of demon dog, you know what I mean?

29:46.607 --> 29:47.768
We've never been, yeah.

29:47.868 --> 29:51.111
And mama puppy and papa puppy never said stuff like that.

29:51.131 --> 29:51.631
No, no, no.

29:51.791 --> 29:56.575
And I feel like whenever we hear those kind of things, I feel kind of scary.

29:58.855 --> 30:04.717
You know, it doesn't really make us feel too good and we don't want you to feel like that either.

30:04.957 --> 30:06.177
You know, it's just not us.

30:06.557 --> 30:10.138
It's just weird.

30:10.218 --> 30:12.839
We prefer more fluffy and fuzzy words, you know?

30:12.859 --> 30:15.960
It's just not us, that's why it's weird.

30:16.180 --> 30:20.041
That's just how we feel.

There's nothing deep about it.
