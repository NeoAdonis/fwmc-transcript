00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.742
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:17.584
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:21.365
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:23.366
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:27.248
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.689
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.791
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:34.431
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.442 --> 00:05:41.847
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning, Ruffians!

00:05:42.548 --> 00:05:45.470
It's our 80th episode today!

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.691
And we still doing!

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:51.037
80th episode at 8am!

00:05:51.057 --> 00:05:54.500
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.781
Are we sure though?

00:05:56.442 --> 00:05:57.503
I'm pretty sure.

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:57.903
Yes.

00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:58.263
80 already?

00:05:58.363 --> 00:05:59.244
I know, right?

00:05:59.264 --> 00:06:01.466
I mean, we do have enough.

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:07.897
Christmas.

00:06:08.298 --> 00:06:11.719
We had the FUWAMOCO Morning specials, but... Specials!

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:18.321
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 80th episode!

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:20.262
BAU BAU!

00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:23.683
Hey, it's already the 80th episode!

00:06:23.743 --> 00:06:26.464
Somehow, we're here at 80 now!

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:29.085
It's not our age.

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.106
Not our age.

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:31.586
No, we're much older than that.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:32.627
BAU BAU!

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:35.928
Well, Ruffians,

00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:38.969
It's our 80th episode today, but... Oh!

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.530
Hatsuriyatai!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.971
I'm gonna explain!

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:52.694
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:53.914
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:55.795
And it's hosted by us.

00:06:56.455 --> 00:06:57.896
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:03.679
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.201
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag... What?

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:10.802
That's not a hashtag.

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:14.804
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:19.347
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:23.270
BAU BAU!

00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:25.812
Hashtag.

00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:28.314
Hashtag.

00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:29.095
Hashtag.

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:32.258
What's the thing you hold stuff in, Moco-chan?

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:34.460
Plastic bag.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.242
Plastic bag.

00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.243
Hashtag.

00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:40.785
Say it again?

00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:42.747
Plastic bag.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:44.168
Hashtag.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:46.685
Huh.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:47.746
BAU BAU!

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:49.087
BAU BAU!

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.230
Wow!

00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:55.373
Maybe not as good as a plastic bag.

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.255
But it looks sort of similar.

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:04.901
A Ruffian spotted Pero again.

00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:11.267
And Moco-chan, you think Pero is a... He looks kind of like a plastic bag.

00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:12.928
But the plastic bag's better?

00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:16.823
Can't hold stuff with Pero.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:21.585
Let's see where he was spotted!

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.065
De-den!

00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:31.489
What does this mean, Moco-chan?

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.110
Was he spotted nowhere?

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.190
De-den!

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.491
I feel...

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:51.786
Just because you're here, a bit of a vision.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:53.327
What's going on here?

00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:58.951
When I look at Pero like that, I'm a bit concerned.

00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:00.652
The look in his eyes.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.295
Straight up, there's a Ruffian.

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:07.996
Were you able to pick up the package?

00:09:09.317 --> 00:09:09.998
What was in it?

00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:16.060
Maybe our debut merch?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.781
That would be nice, you know?

00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:22.062
We hope you're able to get it with no problems.

00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:27.104
But, well... Moco-chan.

00:09:28.004 --> 00:09:29.284
That's the thing.

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:38.248
Well, we were told that this Ruffian hasn't tweeted since they uploaded this photo.

00:09:39.108 --> 00:09:39.208
Oh.

00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:42.925
They might be in trouble.

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:48.567
If you're doing okay, Ruffian, give us a sign!

00:09:48.827 --> 00:09:52.048
I didn't know that picking up packages could be this dangerous.

00:09:52.528 --> 00:09:54.369
Be careful, Ruffians, okay?

00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:55.869
You have to be on the lookout.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.770
Yeah.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.730
Okay.

00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:00.511
Safety's important.

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:01.171
BAU BAU.

00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:01.311
Got it?

00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:01.811
BAU BAU.

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.652
We want you to be safe.

00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:05.113
Got it?

00:10:05.173 --> 00:10:05.473
Yeah.

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:08.354
As demon guards, we want you to be safe.

00:10:09.363 --> 00:10:11.085
BAU BAU!

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:18.493
Well, Ruffians, we have some amazing news for you!

00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:21.336
Adventrix too!

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:29.544
Because, well, Nerissa and Biboo, they're gonna be releasing their first cover song together!

00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:32.547
BAU BAU!

00:10:32.627 --> 00:10:40.795
It's gonna be on Nerissa's channel and it'll be premiering tomorrow on Tuesday at 5pm PT or 10am JST.

00:10:40.835 --> 00:10:43.238
We're so excited!

00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:47.922
We're gonna be singing the song "OTOMEROID"!

00:10:48.243 --> 00:10:49.564
It's cute, so shiny.

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.054
You know what I really like?

00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:58.559
Both Nerissa and Biboo, they have very different voices and personalities.

00:11:20.277 --> 00:11:25.458
I think, you know, it really works so well because they're so different, you know?

00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:25.958
Right, right!

00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:30.379
Yeah, I really love that about Advent, right?

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:35.520
We're all so different, but you know, we come together to make a very special unit!

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.781
Please make sure to check it out, Ruffians!

00:11:38.861 --> 00:11:39.141
Okay!

00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:42.701
Only one more sleep until it premieres.

00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.661
Got it!

00:11:44.282 --> 00:11:45.922
BAU BAU!

00:11:46.782 --> 00:11:50.147
Ruffians, you know, this week is

00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:02.642
BAU!

00:12:02.702 --> 00:12:03.023
BAU!

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:03.283
BAU!

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:24.834
She's doing a pause for a cause charity scheme to raise money for cat protection in the UK!

00:12:24.914 --> 00:12:27.495
BAU BAU!

00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:34.939
And well, I think you know how much we love cats, right Ruffians?

00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:39.236
And, Calli-senpai does too!

00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:42.738
So she invited us to be a part of it!

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:47.121
But you know, our demon dog paws will be put to good use!

00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:50.963
Paws for a Cause!

00:12:51.003 --> 00:13:00.648
We'll be taking a look all together at some of your adorable pets with the hashtag #FUWAMOCALLIPETS.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:03.770
Not just dogs this time.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:04.590
Cats.

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:06.750
It's safe in the cheeks.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.571
Just a little.

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:40.181
But we're also going to be playing a Mario Party together with her and another lovely VTuber named Milky Queen!

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:44.202
And it's the first time for all of us!

00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:49.803
We're really excited because Milky Queen was how we discovered VTubers first!

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:51.324
We really love her!

00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:56.006
We're really looking forward to having such a silly time.

00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:58.267
A Mario Party!

00:13:58.287 --> 00:14:02.870
Kinda brings something different out in FUWAMOCO, right?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.893
We've been trying to get Advent to play with us, but... It hasn't happened.

00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:17.560
Please join us and Calli-senpai for a pause for our first charity stream tomorrow, okay?

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:22.104
Let's all put all our paws towards a good cause.

00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:26.348
BAU BAU!

00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:27.769
It'll be cute.

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:32.914
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's cute pets!

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:33.715
Right!

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:35.096
Especially the cats.

00:14:35.297 --> 00:14:38.279
Please, please send us your cats, okay?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.961
Physically, not just photos.

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:40.462
Yeah.

00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:41.222
Physically.

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:45.146
BAU BAU!

00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:50.631
Well, Ruffians, I wonder... Did you see this?

00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:53.154
They're cool, but...

00:14:53.823 --> 00:14:59.789
But Marine-senchou-senpai drew us an illustration!

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.851
Just for us!

00:15:00.871 --> 00:15:02.412
Just for us, okay?

00:15:02.472 --> 00:15:07.057
She drew Moco-chan here by hand with a mechanical pencil.

00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:08.599
Isn't it adorable?

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:10.060
Adorable, huh?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.201
Yeah.

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:18.125
Ah, well, you know, Marine-senchou-senpai, she said that we're cute, too.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:23.567
But she said that she especially likes how Moco-chan, how you speak.

00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:26.929
I don't really know what she's talking about too much, though.

00:15:28.109 --> 00:15:31.530
I know the Ruffians said on my birthday that you like the way I speak, too.

00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.872
But... I don't know.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.212
I don't know.

00:15:36.232 --> 00:15:36.572
True.

00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:37.212
Agreed 100%.

00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:37.453
Huh?

00:15:37.513 --> 00:15:37.713
Huh?

00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:43.005
Like, BAU BAU!

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:43.625
BAU BAU!

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:44.987
Ore mo!

00:15:45.127 --> 00:15:45.807
Ore mo!

00:15:46.227 --> 00:15:47.548
Morning senchou!

00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:48.889
Morning senchou!

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.590
Ahoy!

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.471
Ahoy!

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:53.393
That sounds weird.

00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:53.893
Ahoy!

00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:55.454
Ahoy!

00:15:55.675 --> 00:15:56.235
Ahoy!

00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:56.876
Ahoy!

00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:01.479
Sounds a little different.

00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:01.979
It does!

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.201
It sounds a little different.

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:06.163
Mococo!

00:16:06.243 --> 00:16:06.303
Huh?

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:09.294
Hi!

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:12.657
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:15.540
I hear it.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:21.164
I hear it, Ruffians.

00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:27.189
Anyways, Marin-senchou-senpai's illustration is now up on our fridge.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.373
Our fridge is a very special spot, okay Ruffians?

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:33.254
It's not just the fridge, okay?

00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:34.375
Because you know,

00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.818
The fridge is where all your food is.

00:16:39.018 --> 00:16:43.820
And whenever you need to have food, which is multiple times a day, you look at the fridge.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.841
It's a special, special spot.

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.141
That's why it's special, because there's food in it!

00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:50.902
And because there's special things on the front, too.

00:16:53.402 --> 00:17:02.509
Well, we really love it that much, okay?

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:03.169
BAU BAU!

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:11.515
Alright, we got illustrations from Calli-senpai, Mikocchi-senpai, Marine-senchou-senpai.

00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:17.580
We're gonna have to start doing more drawings ourselves, but... But, well...

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.730
Ruffians.

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:28.312
Ruffians.

00:17:29.472 --> 00:17:34.254
We have a little bit of an apology to make.

00:17:36.775 --> 00:17:44.018
You know, yesterday we had a homework day, right?

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:46.759
On our schedule it's a homework day.

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:48.020
Yeah.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.032
And you know, we said we're going to work really, really hard, right?

00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:56.733
Get our homework done.

00:17:56.753 --> 00:18:01.916
Yeah.

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:06.939
Well, actually... That's not what happened at all!

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:10.521
We're so, so, so Ruffians!

00:18:12.887 --> 00:18:21.710
There were alarms, and by the time we woke up, it was already way dark out.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.451
Really, really dark.

00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:24.731
Yeah.

00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:29.953
You know, we even would have slept through our regular meeting time with Mine-chan!

00:18:30.553 --> 00:18:33.494
But, luckily it was cancelled yesterday.

00:18:33.554 --> 00:18:34.495
Yeah.

00:18:35.035 --> 00:18:35.255
So...

00:18:37.093 --> 00:18:40.435
We didn't get as much homework done as we had planned.

00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:43.416
Yeah.

00:18:43.816 --> 00:18:46.398
But, but, we did get a lot of rest.

00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:47.418
Yeah.

00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:49.979
Which is really important too, right?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:50.980
Yeah.

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:56.282
It's kind of an important part of our duty as Demon Guide Dogs, too, right?

00:18:56.342 --> 00:18:58.383
You too, Ruffians.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:18:59.103
Right?

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:01.265
That's why I always say right, okay?

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.567
So make sure you rest when you need to rest, okay?

00:19:05.027 --> 00:19:09.230
But, uh... Now we have to run, run, run, okay?

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.291
And, you know, uh... Well, uh...

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.061
And yes, our sleepiness.

00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:26.881
Our soupy brain-ness.

00:19:28.362 --> 00:19:30.762
It also caused something else to happen.

00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:31.643
Yeah.

00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:33.883
Ruffians.

00:19:35.444 --> 00:19:51.048
I don't know how many hours we slept, but because of it, well, there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.884
Somehow, somewhere, many times over, we misunderstood the time that we would be collabing with Koe-senpai.

00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:24.193
You know, we even go from the date and time with her.

00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:28.657
You know, somehow we just really got confused with time zones.

00:20:29.077 --> 00:20:30.258
You know, we're used to it.

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:33.341
We've been doing this forever with no issues.

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:36.203
Why now all of a sudden?

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:37.885
Must be the spring.

00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:39.066
Yeah.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.805
Anyways, we now have five different things on Valentine's Day.

00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:51.349
This is our updated schedule.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.854
We have a karaoke stream together with Kawaii Senpai first thing in the morning at 6am.

00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:00.842
A little early FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:21:01.402 --> 00:21:07.186
And then a collab cover song releases at 7AM on Kuro-senpai's channel.

00:21:07.727 --> 00:21:12.730
And then over on our channel, well, it's FUWAMOCO Morning at 8AM.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:19.694
Then, a super special choose-your-own-adventure Valentine's Day stream at 6PM.

00:21:20.335 --> 00:21:25.158
And finally, our members-only version Valentine's Day stream.

00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:27.772
Yeah.

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:30.753
It's just a bit busy.

00:21:31.113 --> 00:21:31.934
Just a bit.

00:21:32.554 --> 00:21:44.600
Yeah, but between all the prep for the Valentine's Day stream and all our plans, I don't really know when we'll be sleeping, but we know one thing, Ruffians!

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.623
We're going to have an amazing Valentine's Day together with all of you!

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:58.648
Please join us and let's have the best Valentine's Day all together, okay?

00:21:59.109 --> 00:21:59.769
Midnight now.

00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:05.513
BAU BAU!

00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:09.896
You have to be there for the Valentine's Day stream, okay?

00:22:10.076 --> 00:22:11.657
You have to.

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:13.398
BAU BAU!

00:22:17.817 --> 00:22:18.617
Wow!

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.001
Moco-chan, do you know what day of the week it is?

00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:25.143
No, I can't remember anymore.

00:22:26.084 --> 00:22:26.985
Ruffians!

00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:28.567
Do you know what day of the week it is?

00:22:29.207 --> 00:22:36.875
It's Monday, the first day of the week, which means Moco-chan is gonna challenge herself to something new?

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:39.477
New question mark.

00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:45.580
Which is... Overcoming her dislike of natto!

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:53.204
It's now been very many weeks now.

00:22:53.791 --> 00:23:02.614
And Moco-chan's been doing her best to overcome her dislike of natto, which is a Japanese breakfast food, a very popular breakfast food.

00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:03.855
That's fermented beans.

00:23:04.595 --> 00:23:06.235
And it's really good for you!

00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:08.816
And I like it a lot.

00:23:08.836 --> 00:23:09.997
I have it every day.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.550
It's really good for you, good for your tummy.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.511
Vitamins you can only get from natto.

00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:22.552
Which, you know, it's interesting, Moco-chan, because sometimes we hear that from Ruffians that there's a vitamin that you can only get from FUWAMOCO.

00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:25.973
If you think about it, we're like the Ruffians, natto, then, huh?

00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:28.573
So... Ruffians!

00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:30.874
And we are natto-ers!

00:23:31.894 --> 00:23:35.795
So then, Moco-chan, today you have to be a bit of a cannibal.

00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:36.455
What?

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.755
And eat the...

00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:40.497
The bean version of FUWAMOCO.

00:23:43.078 --> 00:23:43.758
Got it!

00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:45.999
Understood?

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:46.599
Yeah.

00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:48.120
Yeah.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.380
Moco-chan!

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.482
It's all ready!

00:23:55.382 --> 00:23:59.624
Why are you making ghost sounds like that?

00:23:59.684 --> 00:24:02.445
Last time, Moco-chan, you ate two beans, right?

00:24:02.645 --> 00:24:03.465
I did!

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:03.845
Yeah!

00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:07.407
But I don't have any stuff for this!

00:24:07.807 --> 00:24:08.087
Stuff?

00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:10.955
Sesame oil.

00:24:10.995 --> 00:24:16.138
Well, I said no to the sesame oil today because I want Moco-chan to improve, Ruffians.

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:18.400
But I did say yes to soy sauce.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.321
I don't want soy sauce!

00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:22.162
I want soy sauce later.

00:24:22.222 --> 00:24:25.524
I don't want sesame oil.

00:24:27.285 --> 00:24:28.967
Moco-chan, do you want the soy sauce?

00:24:29.007 --> 00:24:29.787
No crutches!

00:24:30.868 --> 00:24:31.488
Crunches?

00:24:31.668 --> 00:24:32.769
No, no crutches.

00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:36.852
Soy sauce, no?

00:24:38.137 --> 00:24:39.178
Ruffians, look at the design!

00:24:39.198 --> 00:24:42.180
Wait, I'm gonna pick up a bean and put a drop on the bean.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.261
You have to make sure you aim proper.

00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:46.042
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:24:46.082 --> 00:24:47.103
I haven't picked it up!

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:52.706
Let me choose the bean!

00:24:52.726 --> 00:24:55.748
Choose faster!

00:24:55.968 --> 00:24:57.029
It's stringy!

00:24:57.049 --> 00:25:03.353
Okay, one second, one second!

00:25:03.693 --> 00:25:04.573
Okay, okay, okay.

00:25:05.174 --> 00:25:06.214
Drop of soy sauce.

00:25:06.354 --> 00:25:07.275
Just a drop, just a drop.

00:25:13.534 --> 00:25:16.455
Guess that was your best attempt, huh?

00:25:16.475 --> 00:25:20.577
I see you on there.

00:25:20.837 --> 00:25:22.938
Here we go!

00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:25.159
Here we go!

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.280
Okay, Moco-chan, you can do it!

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.182
No countdown this time!

00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:33.152
3, 2, 2!

00:25:33.162 --> 00:25:40.665
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:25:40.725 --> 00:25:42.086
Don't make that face!

00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:44.057
You got it!

00:25:44.077 --> 00:25:45.378
You got it!

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:47.121
Oh, she's chewing it!

00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:48.402
Yum, yum, yum!

00:25:48.462 --> 00:25:49.984
You did it!

00:25:50.044 --> 00:25:52.487
You did it, Moco-chan!

00:25:52.788 --> 00:25:54.349
I just tasted soy sauce.

00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:56.853
Okay, let's do a second one then.

00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:00.171
It tastes different.

00:26:00.852 --> 00:26:04.533
But I feel like last time when we put soy sauce on it, it was worse.

00:26:05.093 --> 00:26:06.554
Much, much worse.

00:26:07.214 --> 00:26:07.774
No!

00:26:08.154 --> 00:26:14.097
And to be honest, I totally saw the soy sauce completely miss the bean and just get on the chopsticks.

00:26:14.877 --> 00:26:17.538
What does it taste like?

00:26:18.158 --> 00:26:19.779
It maybe tastes like natto?

00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:20.379
No.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.500
Okay.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.581
We're gonna do a second bean!

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:28.231
Let's see if it's any better.

00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:32.156
Could you be getting used to the taste, Moco-chan?

00:26:33.497 --> 00:26:34.418
You chewed it!

00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:35.780
There's no way you didn't taste it.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.541
Okay, go!

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:36.741
Go!

00:26:37.282 --> 00:26:37.883
It's in there!

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:38.523
It's in!

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:39.585
Oh!

00:26:42.388 --> 00:26:43.450
Oh, you're chewing it!

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.132
Can you do a third?

00:26:46.765 --> 00:26:49.166
Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

00:26:49.627 --> 00:26:51.207
It's today's the day!

00:26:51.828 --> 00:26:54.029
Okay Moco-chan, third bean, let's do it!

00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:55.490
Are you gonna take two?

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.690
Two beans at once?

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.831
They're stuck together.

00:26:57.851 --> 00:26:59.311
You can do it, you can do it.

00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:00.632
Four beans.

00:27:01.292 --> 00:27:02.333
Four beans today!

00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:02.893
No.

00:27:03.354 --> 00:27:04.714
Keep going, keep going!

00:27:04.734 --> 00:27:05.635
Let's do three.

00:27:05.675 --> 00:27:07.255
This is a big one though, okay?

00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:08.036
It's a big one.

00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:09.514
Okay, I did it.

00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:10.595
Three beans.

00:27:11.316 --> 00:27:12.236
A little soy sauce.

00:27:12.356 --> 00:27:13.117
Oh, oh, I missed.

00:27:13.137 --> 00:27:13.697
I missed it.

00:27:13.857 --> 00:27:14.298
There we go.

00:27:14.358 --> 00:27:14.738
There we go.

00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:15.839
Is that enough for that?

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:16.279
That's good.

00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:17.120
That's good.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.182
Beautifully covered in a blanket of soy sauce.

00:27:20.282 --> 00:27:21.302
I don't know about that.

00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:23.324
I have the natto from Tochigiza.

00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:24.004
Okay, okay.

00:27:24.164 --> 00:27:24.865
It's very enjoyable.

00:27:24.885 --> 00:27:25.485
Countdown!

00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:26.446
Three!

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.647
Two!

00:27:28.347 --> 00:27:28.547
One!

00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:30.749
Okay, okay.

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:32.430
Some strings, but it's okay.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.230
Moco-chan's a pro.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.913
Oh, except for the face is getting a bit more intense this time.

00:27:39.038 --> 00:27:39.959
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:27:40.199 --> 00:27:40.819
Another bean!

00:27:40.879 --> 00:27:41.680
Another bean!

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.880
Another!

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.281
Another!

00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:45.161
Yeah!

00:27:45.462 --> 00:27:49.603
Another bean!

00:27:50.004 --> 00:27:51.464
I can see it on your face.

00:27:51.524 --> 00:27:54.426
You still have so much room to go.

00:27:55.786 --> 00:27:56.467
I can see it.

00:27:57.247 --> 00:28:01.329
I know all the faces Moco-chan makes when she eats natto.

00:28:01.969 --> 00:28:05.491
And she has so much more natto she can eat today.

00:28:05.991 --> 00:28:07.492
You're just pouring it all over.

00:28:08.915 --> 00:28:09.635
Fourth bean!

00:28:09.735 --> 00:28:10.315
Here we go!

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:14.517
This one has quite a good blanket of soy sauce on it.

00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:19.458
It's gone.

00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:23.299
Oh my goodness!

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:24.960
It tastes different to me.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.900
Four beans!

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.961
It tastes... It tastes very sweet.

00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:31.221
Akemoco-chan, you're gonna go for your fifth bean.

00:28:31.642 --> 00:28:33.122
No soy sauce!

00:28:33.142 --> 00:28:34.302
Yeah!

00:28:35.963 --> 00:28:36.683
No soy sauce.

00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:40.010
No soy sauce for you.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.472
My gosh, this is a miracle, Ruffians!

00:28:43.613 --> 00:28:47.296
It's a Valentine's Day miracle!

00:28:48.537 --> 00:28:49.658
Oh my gosh!

00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:52.520
I didn't eat the natto just for you, okay?

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.362
Moco-chan is becoming unstoppable!

00:28:55.382 --> 00:28:56.743
Natto machine!

00:28:56.764 --> 00:28:58.205
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:28:58.885 --> 00:28:59.446
Go!

00:28:59.546 --> 00:29:00.707
No soy sauce!

00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:03.589
A raw, straight natto bean.

00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:07.012
She chewed it!

00:29:09.899 --> 00:29:11.141
Oh my gosh!

00:29:11.381 --> 00:29:12.743
Ruffians!

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:18.491
Are you just... What's the situation here, Moco-chan?

00:29:18.551 --> 00:29:20.334
Are you just... I don't know.

00:29:21.515 --> 00:29:21.735
Wow.

00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:23.691
I don't know what to say.

00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:26.612
Okay, I need to test you.

00:29:27.092 --> 00:29:29.072
You need to take up at least three at once.

00:29:29.092 --> 00:29:30.113
Three at once?

00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:31.813
And then this could be over.

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:34.594
I don't even know how many beans I'm eating then.

00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:36.434
That's five beans you've eaten.

00:29:36.954 --> 00:29:37.354
Five?

00:29:37.614 --> 00:29:38.615
Yeah, that's five.

00:29:38.895 --> 00:29:40.055
Today you have five!

00:29:40.635 --> 00:29:41.835
You have five today!

00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:45.216
Three at once, we're gonna do it.

00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:46.576
Three at once?

00:29:46.676 --> 00:29:47.156
Yeah.

00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:49.237
And then you can finish your meal.

00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:53.888
Oh my gosh.

00:29:54.488 --> 00:29:58.929
There's more sticky stuff between them when there's many of those.

00:29:58.969 --> 00:29:59.169
Yeah.

00:29:59.209 --> 00:30:00.050
That's the good part.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.670
You have two beans!

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:02.230
One more!

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:03.130
One more!

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.951
I don't think I can pick up three at once.

00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:10.712
Do you want your record to be... Eight beans?

00:30:10.932 --> 00:30:12.352
Or do you want it to be seven beans?

00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:14.713
I think eight is a better number.

00:30:16.473 --> 00:30:16.953
I don't know.

00:30:19.611 --> 00:30:21.492
8 bins to infinity!

00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:22.172
Right!

00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:23.872
8 bins on 80.

00:30:24.032 --> 00:30:24.592
Right.

00:30:26.053 --> 00:30:30.233
That makes sense, but I feel like 3 at once is really pushing it, Ruffians!

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:31.274
You can do it!

00:30:31.294 --> 00:30:33.374
Do you want a bit of soy sauce for this one?

00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:33.954
Yeah.

00:30:36.415 --> 00:30:37.295
There you go.

00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:39.035
Just a little bit of a blanket.

00:30:39.155 --> 00:30:41.036
Okay, this is 3 at once now!

00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:41.676
Okay!

00:30:41.696 --> 00:30:44.136
Okay! 3! 2! 1!

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.964
You did it, Moco-chan!

00:30:53.064 --> 00:30:56.629
I did it!

00:30:56.949 --> 00:30:59.593
Let me see.

00:31:00.434 --> 00:31:00.834
I did it!

00:31:06.682 --> 00:31:07.463
I did it!

00:31:07.643 --> 00:31:10.405
I'm so proud of you, FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:31:10.866 --> 00:31:13.207
BAU BAU!

00:31:13.328 --> 00:31:14.629
I did it, okay?

00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:18.011
I ate eight beers!

00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:20.453
What was my previous record?

00:31:20.794 --> 00:31:20.954
Three.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.691
BAU BAU!

00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:23.591
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:31:23.611 --> 00:31:24.332
I feel confused.

00:31:24.352 --> 00:31:27.736
Yeah, that's almost a whole spoonful!

00:31:43.212 --> 00:31:44.513
Wow.

00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:47.275
You can eat natto?

00:31:47.475 --> 00:31:47.715
No.

00:31:47.935 --> 00:31:49.556
You can't?

00:31:49.576 --> 00:31:49.616
No!

00:31:49.796 --> 00:31:50.337
Wow.

00:31:50.737 --> 00:31:51.657
Ruffians!

00:31:52.218 --> 00:31:56.541
Remember, it's the start of a new week, so you can challenge it!

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.841
You can do the thing!

00:31:58.142 --> 00:32:01.464
Moco-chan, she almost ate eight beans!

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:04.306
That's like a sixteenth of the pack.

00:32:04.586 --> 00:32:05.406
That's pretty good.

00:32:07.153 --> 00:32:10.234
BAU BAU!

00:32:10.294 --> 00:32:13.334
Good job, Moco-chan!

00:32:13.434 --> 00:32:14.374
BAU BAU!

00:32:14.394 --> 00:32:20.176
I thank you farmers in Tochigi for making delicious natto.

00:32:20.196 --> 00:32:21.676
BAU BAU!

00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:26.017
This week, you know, is Cali-senpai's paws for the cause charity.

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:30.217
But let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day.

00:32:30.758 --> 00:32:32.318
Doggie of the Day is...

00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:34.910
De-den!

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.392
BAU BAU!

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.410
Big, big eyes.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.131
I love you!

00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:51.511
So cute!

00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:52.352
Very cute!

00:32:52.432 --> 00:32:53.832
Nose too!

00:32:53.892 --> 00:32:55.893
Big booba boy!

00:32:56.293 --> 00:32:58.554
Well, Kota's a very good boy.

00:32:58.574 --> 00:33:02.735
He loves to play and cuddle and sleep.

00:33:03.255 --> 00:33:04.695
All good things, huh?

00:33:04.796 --> 00:33:07.336
How does Kota BAU BAU?

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.060
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.441
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:11.841
BAU BAU!

00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:41.445
You can see all the sweetness behind those puppy dog eyes.

00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:44.406
But Ruffians, do you notice something?

00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:46.567
Yeah.

00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:47.568
You see that there?

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:48.028
We noticed.

00:33:48.348 --> 00:33:49.008
Cora!

00:33:49.388 --> 00:33:52.909
Cora has the pick of any shoe to chew on there.

00:33:52.929 --> 00:33:53.950
A lot of shoes!

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.690
Yeah.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.351
And not a single one has been bitten.

00:33:57.611 --> 00:33:58.711
Not a single one!

00:33:58.792 --> 00:33:59.132
Right?

00:33:59.552 --> 00:34:01.713
What a good doggy!

00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.573
You are, Cora!

00:34:03.673 --> 00:34:05.354
BAU BAU!

00:34:05.394 --> 00:34:07.294
Good self-control.

00:34:07.355 --> 00:34:08.115
Not one!

00:34:08.395 --> 00:34:09.575
BAU BAU!

00:34:11.796 --> 00:34:17.182
And next for our today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

00:34:18.003 --> 00:34:22.468
It's a beautiful day!

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:30.577
It really makes you want to go like dance and sing and be swirly about in the shining green field.

00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:31.959
Did you do that?

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:32.840
I feel like

00:34:33.462 --> 00:34:36.464
You know, it would make sense if there was a fuzzy cow or two.

00:34:37.265 --> 00:34:41.428
And I could jump on the cow, see what happens.

00:34:41.448 --> 00:34:42.509
Yeah!

00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:47.633
But, you know, this kind of beautiful day really makes me so excited for spring!

00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:48.234
Right!

00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:50.676
Just around the corner, how rough it is!

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:55.079
Think of all those wonderful walks waiting for us then, huh?

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.661
I can't wait!

00:34:57.021 --> 00:34:57.882
BAU BAU!

00:35:01.384 --> 00:35:06.965
Oh, and next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:07.346
Oh!

00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:10.706
Hi, Fuwawa-chan, uh, Moco-chan!

00:35:10.786 --> 00:35:11.447
Hello!

00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:13.227
I have a question for Moco-chan.

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:17.688
You said you really like succulents, and you have some plants already.

00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:22.229
Is there an occasion why you started to care for them, and what is your favorite kind?

00:35:22.529 --> 00:35:25.410
Your morning programs always make my day!

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.190
BAU BAU!

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.171
Wow, wow, Moco-chan.

00:35:30.307 --> 00:35:34.189
Originally, I saw succulents online.

00:35:35.389 --> 00:35:38.390
And, I don't know, I wanted to care for something.

00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:42.572
I guess, I guess I felt a bit lonely.

00:35:42.592 --> 00:35:44.472
I wanted some friends.

00:35:45.153 --> 00:35:47.294
I know they don't die easily!

00:35:48.254 --> 00:35:49.814
They won't leave you alone!

00:35:50.555 --> 00:35:50.975
And I...

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:52.559
I don't know.

00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:53.980
They look really fun.

00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:57.082
There's a lot of different types.

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:58.382
I know.

00:35:58.883 --> 00:36:03.125
They're very resilient, but also kind of particular about stuff.

00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:05.326
Kind of like me.

00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:07.688
And, I don't know.

00:36:08.108 --> 00:36:09.689
I like taking care of them.

00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:12.770
Although mine are very, very thirsty right now.

00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:15.332
But they aren't dead!

00:36:16.072 --> 00:36:17.413
Are they being taken care of?

00:36:17.513 --> 00:36:19.014
They are being taken care of.

00:36:19.594 --> 00:36:26.621
I wish I could get more light because the more light that some of them have then they turn

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.131
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:59.694 --> 00:37:00.195
BAU BAU!

00:37:09.949 --> 00:37:13.453
We have another theme coming up today.

00:37:13.473 --> 00:37:15.276
What theme is that, Moco-chan?

00:37:15.636 --> 00:37:18.600
We have White Album!

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.222
De-den!

00:37:20.402 --> 00:37:23.706
We're playing White Album.

00:37:24.086 --> 00:37:29.012
If you haven't heard of it before, it's a visual novel that we really, really like.

00:37:29.853 --> 00:37:31.175
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:45.373 --> 00:37:47.754
Things get dramatic.

00:37:47.794 --> 00:38:04.560
You know and well especially with her famous senpai also an idol she took us out on a date and then we saw we might have seen Yuki and her producer also out for a date business meeting date and then you know Yuki's manager trying to start a

00:38:05.709 --> 00:38:06.209
BAU BAU!

00:38:34.127 --> 00:38:38.289
And for our schedule, well, as you know, we messed up.

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:39.389
We messed up!

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.971
So please make sure that you take a good look at the updated version of our schedule.

00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.293
You can also find it on the YouTube community page and Twitter.

00:38:48.453 --> 00:38:55.156
And yes, let's have a lot of fun while surviving an extra special Valentine's Day together.

00:38:55.516 --> 00:39:00.438
Make sure, you know, our special Valentine's Day stream makes sure you're there.

00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:01.959
You have to be there, okay?

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:03.220
BAU BAU!

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.164
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 80th episode!

00:39:08.244 --> 00:39:15.811
Thank you for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning here with us.

00:39:23.228 --> 00:39:28.352

00:39:28.373 --> 00:39:29.654
Thank you so much!
