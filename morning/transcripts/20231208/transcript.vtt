00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.597
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:05.582
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:05.743 --> 00:05:09.508
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:11.370
BAU BAU!

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.975
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.118
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.062
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:20.122 --> 00:05:21.103
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:23.767
You're really tall today, huh?

00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:25.008
I'm tall.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.576
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:31.818
Even if I was tall today.

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:34.561
Did you stretch a bit too hard?

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.823
Yeah, I did stretch quite a bit.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:41.427
I was feeling a little sore after yesterday, but... But Ruffians!

00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:46.992
Thank you for joining us today for our 54th episode!

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.254
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.814 --> 00:06:00.984
Well, for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show, and it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:01.824
A.K.A.

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:02.665
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.146
It's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:06.487 --> 00:06:12.848
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.808
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:17.989
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.310
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.690
BAU BAU!

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.890
Ruffians.

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.271
Ruffians first.

00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:38.055
I wanted to say that was uncalled for, Moco-chan.

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:39.516
Great sneezy morning!

00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:44.899
I was gonna apologize, but now I have to apologize for Moco-chan too.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.821
Ruffians, I'm sorry.

00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.163
I'm sorry for the sister of mine.

00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:59.930
And I'm also sorry because it seems like Pero kinda took over FUWAMOCO Morning the other day.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.479
Are you doing okay, Ruffians?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.700
You know, especially because Moco-chan wasn't there at the pup talk for you.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.421
Is that my fault now?

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:16.702
It's not your fault, but... We hope Pero wasn't too nasty.

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:19.783
You're traumatized.

00:07:20.283 --> 00:07:22.883
Oh my gosh.

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.844
Pero's break was ruined.

00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:30.965
Wait, your body's now... I don't know about that.

00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:36.326
Well, it seems like he was there to try to teach us a lesson.

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:39.548
That FUWAMOCO Morning is too long, right?

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.472
You know, it is a short-format morning show after all.

00:07:44.773 --> 00:07:46.874
Like I say every morning, right?

00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:49.656
So, we're gonna have to shorten it down.

00:07:49.857 --> 00:07:54.080
Otherwise, Pero will be back waaaay sooner than...

00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:55.018
BAU BAU!

00:07:55.038 --> 00:07:55.318
BAU BAU!

00:07:55.338 --> 00:07:55.518
BAU BAU!

00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:24.933
You're confused.

00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:25.533
It's okay.

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:26.154
It's the morning.

00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:27.215
You're still sleepy.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:29.197
You don't know what's going on.

00:08:29.537 --> 00:08:30.017
It's okay.

00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:30.358
It's okay!

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:35.803
Hopefully we don't see Peron for a very long, long time now.

00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:35.903
Yeah.

00:08:37.764 --> 00:08:38.005
Why?

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:39.866
What?

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:40.487
What?

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:41.648
What?

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.632
There was a... Okay, what's sighting?

00:08:48.837 --> 00:08:50.338
What did I just see, though?

00:08:51.338 --> 00:08:54.879
Well, let's see where this Ruffian spotted Pero.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.741
De-den!

00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:00.782
Oh!

00:09:02.082 --> 00:09:03.903
There's Pero, that's him.

00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:06.244
Oh gosh.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:11.466
Ruffians, do we really need to give him any more attention than he deserves?

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.284
Trying to sniff your tires.

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.788
Is this some sort of hobby of Pero's?

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:20.531
Sounds kinda like it.

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.349
That's kind of a dangerous hobby you got there.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.953
You know, being low to the ground, behind a car tire there.

00:09:29.854 --> 00:09:33.597
Ruffians, definitely don't try this kind of thing, okay?

00:09:33.737 --> 00:09:33.977
Yeah.

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:36.359
Pero is asking for trouble.

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:37.740
Yeah.

00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:45.326
Well, hopefully everything worked out for this Ruffian and you were able to use your car with no troubles afterwards.

00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:46.888
Right?

00:09:47.148 --> 00:09:47.368
Yeah.

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:48.609
No trouble.

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:54.381
BAU BAU!

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:55.983
Forget about that.

00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:57.043
Forget about it.

00:09:57.104 --> 00:09:58.985
I just wanna forget about it.

00:09:59.025 --> 00:10:00.346
Forget about it.

00:10:00.747 --> 00:10:01.507
But next!

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:02.768
Ruffians!

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:05.050
RuffianS!

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.732
We're so happy because...

00:10:08.783 --> 00:10:10.044
Lifetime Showtime!

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:11.424
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:11.484 --> 00:10:13.165
I am with you in your song!

00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:16.026
Got 300,000 views!

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:19.207
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.507
Thank you!

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.160
We did it!

00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:26.363
We shared lifetime showtime back with you!

00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:29.465
During our debut, you were remembered by Ruffians!

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.787
And it's hit 300,000 views now!

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.949
Thank you so much for loving it!

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.050
And listening to it so much, Ruffians!

00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:38.211
Thank you!

00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.233
It really means so much to us.

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:48.560
Especially, you know, since before we talked about it, our big goal was maybe that it could hit 300,000 views one day, right?

00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:50.802
And you know it!

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.084
We did it!

00:10:53.325 --> 00:10:54.045
We did it!

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:57.228
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:10:57.248 --> 00:11:00.031
Wow, this song, my first showtime, it was written by another

00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:01.012
I got it.

00:11:29.092 --> 00:11:31.113
You are so many subscribers!

00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:33.875
Has hit 3 million views!

00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:36.856
BAU BAU!

00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:38.718
Thank you!

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:42.600
My first cover song.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.641
Ruffians, you were pretty surprised, right?

00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:45.301
When we said it.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.003
With you at the end of our debut, right?

00:11:48.043 --> 00:11:50.924
Right, because you listened to Lifetime so many times.

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:51.825
BAU BAU!

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:52.485
BAU BAU!

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:53.125
BAU BAU!

00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:53.566
Right.

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:55.327
Right!

00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:57.028
Right, you know.

00:11:57.768 --> 00:12:06.280
We weren't able to see your reaction then, because you know we were busy running off to meet up with all the Advent members, you know, for a collab.

00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:10.466
I'm still curious.

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:11.889
What were you feeling back then?

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.856
But thank you so much, Ruffians, for still listening to a bunch.

00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:20.159
It really means a lot to us.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.768
And we hope that we can put a lot more effort and strength and power into putting more music

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.209
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:32.930
Thank you!

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.511
Moco-chan, what kind of song would you like to sing next?

00:12:35.652 --> 00:12:36.212
I don't know.

00:12:36.832 --> 00:12:38.713
There's a lot of songs that I would like to sing.

00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:38.973
Right?

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:41.354
Kaibutsu was kind of cool and powerful.

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:44.176
I sort of have fun sort of surprising the Ruffians.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:52.179
So I feel like I would like to do, maybe, maybe not very soon, but sometime I would like to do something that surprises you.

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:53.540
Surprises the Ruffians.

00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.312
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:12:56.352 --> 00:12:56.592
BAU BAU!

00:12:56.932 --> 00:12:59.753
I don't really get it, but it's very happy!

00:13:16.613 --> 00:13:20.055
The hololive reddit has hit over 1,000,000!

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:20.915
BAU BAU!

00:13:22.696 --> 00:13:26.038
Can you believe it?

00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:27.818
That's a lot of people, Ruffians.

00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:29.779
A lot of people.

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:31.521
1,000,000.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.521
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for loving hololive.

00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:40.004
No matter where you are on the internet, be it YouTube or Twitter or TikTok and Reddit.

00:13:40.084 --> 00:13:41.165
Thank you!

00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:41.745
Nice.

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:52.470
We hope, Ruffians, that you'll continue to share your passion about hololive with everyone out there.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:14:01.475
You know, we actually joined the hololive reddit recently, and we started posting every now and then, so if you see us there, don't be surprised.

00:14:01.495 --> 00:14:06.297
You know, every now and then I see in the comments being like, is this the actual FUWAMOCO?

00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:12.040
Yeah, I know it says BAU BAU.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.701
It does.

00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:17.703
But you know, we don't really know how Reddit works still, so...

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:19.493
BAU BAU!

00:14:49.213 --> 00:14:50.514
Thank you!

00:14:50.594 --> 00:14:51.714
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:54.316
Thank you, hololive fans!

00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:58.818
Well, actually... On Monday.

00:14:58.838 --> 00:15:00.659
Monday.

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:01.860
Monday was it.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.242
Well, we asked for something from you, Ruffians.

00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:12.565
And finally, we got our first big FUWAMOCO scoop!

00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:15.447
Given to us by a Ruffian.

00:15:16.407 --> 00:15:17.148
We have...

00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:22.000
Kronii passed her driver's license exam!

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.660
BAU BAU!

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.901
Yeah!

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:27.602
So Kronii-senpai just passed her driver's license exam.

00:15:27.702 --> 00:15:28.622
That's pretty cool.

00:15:28.722 --> 00:15:29.503
Amazing.

00:15:29.543 --> 00:15:33.024
Congratulations Kronii-senpai!

00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:33.984
Congratulations!

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:34.864
I'm not envious.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:40.126
You know, we've heard that those kind of things are pretty rough sometimes.

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:42.227
As demon guard dogs...

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:45.067
We like to keep our paws on the ground, yeah.

00:15:45.378 --> 00:16:04.585
Yeah, safety. But it would be kinda nice to try it again. But at least right now, Ruffians, our priority is protecting your smile, so... Well, maybe it would be kinda cool if Kronii-senpai could show us her driving skills one day, Ruffians!

00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:06.147
What do you think?

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:07.409
What do you think?

00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:10.694
Okay idea, good idea. Is it safe to get in a vehicle with her?

00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:18.405
I'm getting nervous!

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:31.219
BAU BAU!

00:16:31.239 --> 00:16:31.560
BAU BAU!

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.120
BAU BAU!

00:17:01.726 --> 00:17:03.828
Ruffians.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.113
There's been, I guess, a misunderstanding.

00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:12.776
A bit of a misunderstanding.

00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:13.977
Yeah.

00:17:14.477 --> 00:17:19.401
Kind of a big misunderstanding.

00:17:19.542 --> 00:17:24.826
Well, this time, you know, Fuwawa, she misunderstood something.

00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:27.589
That's why it's a big misunderstanding, okay?

00:17:29.363 --> 00:17:30.364
Guys, you see.

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:33.328
During our holo parade stream.

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:35.050
You know there was a minigame.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.254
And up at the top right, it had the game controls written out.

00:17:38.334 --> 00:17:39.695
You know, like this.

00:17:41.998 --> 00:17:44.060
What do you think it's saying?

00:17:45.722 --> 00:17:45.883
Well.

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:47.844
Fuwawa!

00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:51.886
She understood it as W equals jump.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.067
S equals space.

00:17:56.148 --> 00:18:01.111
And thought that those were the buttons to control the character the entire time.

00:18:01.632 --> 00:18:02.372
She thought that.

00:18:02.992 --> 00:18:04.473
Until yesterday evening.

00:18:06.969 --> 00:18:14.714
Ruffians, I only realized that it really doesn't make sense yesterday, but... You know W jump?

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:16.195
Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.096
The S space.

00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:19.777
She wasn't thinking about it.

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:24.378
Now that I think about it, it makes my head hurt.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:30.043
Yeah, my head hurt when you were saying it too.

00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:36.308
Well, you know, it's just that keyboard controls are always weird for games, right?

00:18:36.488 --> 00:18:41.513
So, it made sense to me at that moment, but... I guess not.

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:41.573
No.

00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:42.013
Uh-uh.

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:44.055
Yeah.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.576
It's an honest mistake.

00:18:46.217 --> 00:18:47.197
That's kind of you.

00:18:48.553 --> 00:18:49.214
Thank you.

00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:50.295
Thank you.

00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:57.502
But, well, I'll do my best next time to maybe understand the game's controls better.

00:18:57.522 --> 00:18:58.243
You do need to.

00:18:59.164 --> 00:19:01.706
It's important for me to be able to help you, Moco-chan.

00:19:01.746 --> 00:19:02.427
But you don't.

00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:03.388
I do!

00:19:03.468 --> 00:19:06.371
Even yesterday you didn't want to help even though there was a controller.

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:06.571
I did!

00:19:06.591 --> 00:19:08.413
You didn't take the controller in your own paws.

00:19:08.533 --> 00:19:08.873
I took it.

00:19:08.893 --> 00:19:10.235
You did after I yelled at you.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:20.257
But yes, I'll do my best not to misunderstand and okay, Ruffians!

00:19:21.898 --> 00:19:23.559
BAU BAU!

00:19:24.219 --> 00:19:26.601
The Ruffians are so kind though.

00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:30.223
It was just an honest mistake, alright?

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:32.465
Thank you for agreeing.

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:34.026
Moco-chan agrees.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.927
Okay, next thing, next thing.

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:37.548
So, Ruffians!

00:19:37.948 --> 00:19:41.211
I know, I talked about, you know, going to sleep yesterday.

00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:42.692
Only to happen.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.293
Yeah, yeah, it happens.

00:19:44.353 --> 00:19:45.614
Going to sleep happens.

00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:49.576
But, I was woken up only an hour after going to sleep, right?

00:19:50.797 --> 00:19:57.402
But, during that time, you know, I had a pretty cool dream!

00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:01.645
So, I had a dream.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.732
I don't know, this is so specific I feel.

00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:21.483
I can see it!

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:22.363
I can see it!

00:20:22.503 --> 00:20:26.484
Yes, okay, but it was drawn in a very nostalgic sort of, like, natsukashii style.

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:29.625
Maybe like pixel art or something like that.

00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:30.685
It was very cute.

00:20:30.706 --> 00:20:31.946
They were all very happy, okay?

00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:35.027
Happy squirrels running together, pixelized.

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:35.987
Good wallpaper.

00:20:36.327 --> 00:20:47.370
But, the thing is, is that when you looked at it from a different angle, you could see more into the world and more things, like stuff behind them in different angles.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.630
So,

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:54.534
It was very detailed and I could see like different train lines behind them and buildings.

00:20:54.994 --> 00:20:57.316
But then suddenly I could see Godzilla.

00:20:58.337 --> 00:21:02.500
And then some buildings looked more like the main street, the Chuo Dori and Akihabara.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.062
And then there was Mahoro from Mahoromatic.

00:21:07.363 --> 00:21:10.826
It was a very immersive wallpaper experience.

00:21:10.946 --> 00:21:11.546
Oh yeah.

00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:13.628
And then I woke up.

00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:16.230
And I didn't have the wallpaper.

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:21.042
Is there any way I can get a wallpaper like this now?

00:21:22.924 --> 00:21:26.368
Is there fancy ones now?

00:21:32.255 --> 00:21:33.437
Is nothing new like that?

00:21:33.517 --> 00:21:33.897
Yes!

00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:36.680
There's wallpapers like that now!

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:38.959
I don't know.

00:21:38.979 --> 00:21:46.043
For now, our desktop wallpaper is still the Advent Debut Key Visual, which I'm very happy with.

00:21:46.503 --> 00:21:49.565
But you know, if there's cool new wallpapers, I would like to see them.

00:21:49.925 --> 00:21:50.245
Why?

00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:53.787
Dreams can be flying high!

00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:56.909
We follow your cursor?

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.852
That's pretty cool, but it's not as cool as seeing things at different angles high.

00:22:02.032 --> 00:22:07.455
Could you imagine if the Advent Debut Key Visual, if we all followed the cursor?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.601
Oh my gosh.

00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:14.543
That would be cool.

00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:19.026
I think that Moco-chan, that our wallpaper will probably never change.

00:22:19.426 --> 00:22:20.066
Probably.

00:22:20.147 --> 00:22:20.587
Yeah.

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:22.608
It's probably gonna be forever this.

00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:24.149
Actually, I don't think so.

00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.790
What?

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.210
Why?

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.131
Nevermind!

00:22:28.072 --> 00:22:29.553
BAU BAU!

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:34.076
Well, that was an interesting dream, Moco-chan.

00:22:34.096 --> 00:22:35.517
I think there's a...

00:22:37.018 --> 00:22:37.458
I don't know.

00:22:37.478 --> 00:22:40.740
Ruffians!

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.501
Let's check out some of your submissions.

00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:44.562
Starting with the Doggie of the Day!

00:22:44.642 --> 00:22:48.345
We have... De-den!

00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:48.925
Why?

00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:51.346
The Doggie of the Day today is me!

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.087
Not Fuwawa.

00:22:54.048 --> 00:22:55.088
Not Fuwawa.

00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:58.010
The Doggie of the Day is not Fuwawa.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.671
It's me!

00:23:00.071 --> 00:23:00.471
It's me!

00:23:03.593 --> 00:23:06.335
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:34.934
Mii is a bear.

00:23:34.954 --> 00:23:37.015
I love those silly eyes.

00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:39.737
Hey Moco-chan, do you think you could make the same face as Mii there?

00:23:39.957 --> 00:23:42.478
Or BAU BAU-ing into a fan?

00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:49.222
Ah, like a... Is that the sound Mii makes?

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.423
That's the sound of Mii in front of the fan.

00:23:51.443 --> 00:23:52.203
That's how Mii BAU BAU-s.

00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:53.764
Yes, in front of the fan!

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:58.367
You know when it's just quiet, but then you're in front of the fan and you're like...

00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:01.396
And the AC is just right.

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:06.118
Like that!

00:24:06.138 --> 00:24:10.359
I don't know, I think Mii-chan would probably be like BAU!

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:16.962
Wait, it's in the fan, right?

00:24:18.303 --> 00:24:20.844
Moco-chan, it has to have the fan sound.

00:24:20.924 --> 00:24:22.124
I can't do that!

00:24:22.204 --> 00:24:27.526
BAU!

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:28.947
I don't know, I don't know.

00:24:30.627 --> 00:24:31.648
Good reason.

00:24:31.688 --> 00:24:33.009
Mii needs it.

00:24:33.189 --> 00:24:33.469
Really.

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:47.828
Safety is number one.

00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:49.689
Do we not want more singing?

00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:50.450
Maybe not sometimes.

00:25:02.678 --> 00:25:06.340
Yeah, but me, me is a very, very good friend.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.781
Very good friend, yes.

00:25:08.661 --> 00:25:12.163
BAU BAU!

00:25:12.223 --> 00:25:13.023
Cute.

00:25:13.383 --> 00:25:14.044
And more!

00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:16.005
Today I went on a walk.

00:25:16.045 --> 00:25:16.185
Walk?

00:25:16.305 --> 00:25:17.165
Where did we go to?

00:25:17.265 --> 00:25:19.726
We have de-den!

00:25:19.746 --> 00:25:22.688
So cute!

00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:28.891
It sort of looks like one of the winter romance movies.

00:25:30.673 --> 00:25:32.397
The perfect day spot.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.206
It'd be nice to go there one more time.

00:25:36.987 --> 00:25:39.272
You can drink the apple cider.

00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:43.376
Have lots of apple cider, not hot choco.

00:25:43.396 --> 00:25:45.057
Not hot Mococo.

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:46.278
Not hot choco.

00:26:06.225 --> 00:26:07.986
BAU BAU!

00:26:08.827 --> 00:26:11.888
And then we have our Question of the Day.

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.770
We have... De-den!

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.091
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:16.691
Good morning!

00:26:16.731 --> 00:26:18.192
Quick question.

00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:21.414
Since Pero is your demon dog master mentor.

00:26:21.614 --> 00:26:21.914
Hi.

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:22.515
Mentor.

00:26:22.755 --> 00:26:23.395
Mentor.

00:26:23.435 --> 00:26:26.357
He's just a pet, really.

00:26:26.457 --> 00:26:28.198
Please don't let him know, okay?

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:39.536
Would this mean that once you become masters yourself that you would transform into a form similar to Pero's squishy physique?

00:26:40.037 --> 00:26:42.138
BAU BAU!

00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:45.761
FUWAMOCO similar to Pero.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.032
Hi!

00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:54.677
Why would that ever happen?

00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:57.280
Has anything given you that impression?

00:26:57.761 --> 00:27:01.104
That we would transform into something so grotesque?

00:27:02.386 --> 00:27:04.368
You know, Hale is Pero.

00:27:04.848 --> 00:27:05.809
He's our mentor.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.452
You know, Papa Puppy.

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:10.333
Does Papa Puppy look like Pero?

00:27:10.594 --> 00:27:12.335
No, that would be awful.

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:15.318
You know, we have more than just two bones.

00:27:15.338 --> 00:27:16.619
We're fluffy!

00:27:16.979 --> 00:27:17.540
We're fuzzy!

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:17.900
Yeah.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:21.489
Master Koi Dogs!

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:22.750
Master Koi Dogs FUWAMOCO!

00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:45.438
BAU BAU!

00:27:56.028 --> 00:28:00.230
Next, we have a very important stream coming up.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.370
We do!

00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:02.072
Our next stream is... De-den!

00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:07.315
We're playing Play It Up together with all of Advent unit.

00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:07.916
Right!

00:28:08.376 --> 00:28:13.960
But more important, we have a very big announcement!

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.082
An announcement from all of us.

00:28:17.502 --> 00:28:20.524
And we really want you to be there to hear it first, okay?

00:28:20.624 --> 00:28:21.024
Okay!

00:28:22.245 --> 00:28:23.226
You'll be there, right?

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.006
You'll be there!

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:27.488
It's gonna be fun!

00:28:28.648 --> 00:28:29.068
It is!

00:28:29.108 --> 00:28:32.690
But we're really, really excited to share this announcement with you!

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.971
Please be there, okay?

00:28:35.391 --> 00:28:38.053
Pero already spoiled the announcement.

00:28:38.773 --> 00:28:39.093
Huh?

00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:40.234
What?

00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:42.015
What?

00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:46.817
Oh my gosh, that's a big deal.

00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:49.578
Wait, what?

00:28:49.638 --> 00:28:50.499
What do you know?

00:28:51.593 --> 00:28:52.594
What do you know?

00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:53.895
Tell us.

00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:55.176
Tell us.

00:28:55.196 --> 00:28:58.839
Huh?

00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:03.103
Do we have to get Mane-chan involved now?

00:29:03.143 --> 00:29:04.143
You can't tell us!

00:29:04.864 --> 00:29:06.705
Do we have to get Mane-chan involved?

Oh my gosh, this is gonna become a... A big... A big problem.

But we're looking really, really forward to it.

00:29:56.066 --> 00:30:01.169
And you know, it's been a little while, so we'll have a nice, sweet time playing together again.

00:30:01.249 --> 00:30:02.210
No scary stuff.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.693
Not becoming an elephant.

00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:08.455
