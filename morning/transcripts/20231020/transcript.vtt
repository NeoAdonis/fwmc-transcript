00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.031
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:17.933
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:21.835
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:23.776
BAU BAU!

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:27.057
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.138
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:32.059
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:33.220
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.964
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:43.589
Thank you Ruffians for being here, waking up early for our 34th episode!

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.490
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:58.020
I saw there was a couple Ruffians saying that maybe this was their first time watching live today.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.221
Or their first time watching in a long time.

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:05.024
Which reminds you, FUWAMOCO- It's a very serious matter.

00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:06.704
Very serious, okay?

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:07.985
Make sure you get it.

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:09.586
No misunderstandings, okay?

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:17.254
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, today, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:17.274 --> 00:06:17.975
A.K.A.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.117
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:22.420
And is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:28.187
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:36.212
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:40.774
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:45.036
BAU BAU!

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.778
Ruffians, how are you feeling today?

00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:49.839
You're feeling... Awake.

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.499
Excited.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:51.140
Awake.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.740
Frightened.

00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:56.502
There was a Pero Sighting?

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:56.702
Oi!

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:57.643
I see you.

00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:00.138
Hopefully not a very scary one.

00:07:00.158 --> 00:07:00.798
Not a scary one.

00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:01.638
Not a vicious one.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:02.459
No vicious.

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:03.539
Let's see.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.760
De-den!

00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:08.842
A special flying dog?

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.984
This is a bit of a surprising sighting.

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:12.544
Right!

00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:17.286
Pero just swooped on in and started staring at you deliously.

00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:21.909
You better do something before he messes with your plants.

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:23.690
You don't want him to push them over, right?

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.371
You know, I have a few little succulents.

00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:30.854
And I always have to keep an eye on Pero so he doesn't do anything to them too, you know?

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:34.356
But you know, there's the owl plant, right?

00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:35.817
FUWAMOCO-chan's plant.

00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:38.658
Yeah, and succulents can look pretty yummy too, right?

00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:46.463
You know, Pero keeps on saying that if I'm not careful he's gonna take a big bite out of them.

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:51.197
So, hopefully, he doesn't do anything like that to your butt.

00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:52.158
Okay?

00:07:52.519 --> 00:08:00.166
But you know, the joke's on him, cause if he does, he'll just get violently sick!

00:08:01.992 --> 00:08:07.136
Ruffians, don't hit us with that if we ever decide to get nice and close to your plants, okay?

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:32.550
I don't want to get bonked by the shoe, okay?

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.913
Don't bonk us with your shoe, Ruffians.

00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:40.035
But shoes and slippers are the best against unwanted pests, though, right?

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:40.876
It is.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:42.217
You know an unwanted pest?

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:44.178
I guess.

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:45.699
He's good at biting plants, you know.

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:46.399
Yeah, he's a pest.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.383
But we were taught this secret method between guard dogs here in Japan and

00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:54.445
Since then, we've never done anything else.

00:08:54.485 --> 00:08:55.045
This is it.

00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:55.906
This is the method.

00:08:56.306 --> 00:09:00.289
I think some Ruffians know that I don't really like socks.

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:05.252
And I have slippers, but they're rarely used for my feet.

00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:07.213
BAU BAU!

00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:07.934
BAU BAU!

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:08.294
BAU BAU!

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.014
BAU BAU!

00:09:36.698 --> 00:09:43.402
Well, we'd actually like to invite you to our Advent Halloween Party!

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.663
BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:46.784
Ruffians, I see a lot of noise.

00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:48.305
I'm concerned.

00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:49.946
We invited you already.

00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:52.448
We invited you already, you didn't forget about our invitation.

00:09:52.488 --> 00:09:53.749
You didn't forget, right.

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:54.890
We invited you.

00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:57.771
I'm really concerned, Moco-chan.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:58.412
Right.

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:01.857
Well, Ruffians, now you have plans, okay?

00:10:02.357 --> 00:10:03.157
We have plans!

00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:05.478
There is plans, you have plans!

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:11.599
Because this year, we're having a Halloween party!

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:15.380
A special costume party too!

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.741
A lot of Ruffians have been designing outfits for us, right?

00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:20.261
I'm really happy!

00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:23.162
But you haven't forgotten about yourself too, right?

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.413
You need to have a costume for yourself too, you know.

00:10:28.653 --> 00:10:29.894
It's a costume party.

00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:36.479
Please don't forget to share your hololive themed costumes with the hashtag Advent Costume Party on Twitter.

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:37.719
And you know what?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.643
All of Advent, we might review it during our party.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.705
That would be pretty cool, right?

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:49.208
You know, it doesn't even need to be anything amazing at all.

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:50.530
Nothing fancy.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.033
We just want to see your love and passion, right?

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.334
Just that, you know.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:57.338
You know you could dress up as a pebble, right?

00:10:57.778 --> 00:11:00.281
Or a petal like I mentioned yesterday, too.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.906
Or even like a FUWAMOCO-themed outfit, right?

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:05.027
You know, we've got some...

00:11:06.108 --> 00:11:08.169
Please share them with us, okay?

00:11:08.229 --> 00:11:09.370
We're waiting!

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.130
We're waiting!

00:11:35.604 --> 00:11:37.466
BAU BAU!

00:11:39.247 --> 00:11:40.408
I'm excited for you.

00:11:40.848 --> 00:11:43.670
Lots of Halloween stories.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.893
But not Halloween related.

00:11:48.233 --> 00:11:56.799
Ruffians, Moco-chan has something to confess to you.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.361
Something kind of...

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.281
Really, really, really embarrassing.

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:07.444
And, you know, Moco-chan, she's been kind of thinking about whether she should share it with you for a long time now.

00:12:07.484 --> 00:12:09.125
It sounds like you're pretty happy, huh?

00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:09.606
Me?

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:12.588
No, but, you know, it's been, it's been weighing on your chest.

00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:14.489
It's been really, really embarrassing!

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:20.032
It's been weighing on your chest and, you know, it might be good to feel FU afterwards, you know?

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:21.093
Yeah.

00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:24.715
But it's... You don't want anything weighing on my chest?

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:30.189
Wow, Moco-chan.

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:31.430
Please, yeah.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.832
Feel free, feel free, you know?

00:12:34.032 --> 00:12:34.712
Freedom waits.

00:12:37.554 --> 00:12:38.455
BAU!

00:12:40.657 --> 00:12:53.766
You know... It might be a bit surprising, but... I'm actually really afraid of big dogs.

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:56.929
Yeah.

00:12:58.476 --> 00:13:06.883
You know, any dog that's bigger than me, for some reason, I don't really know why, but maybe they feel the fear from me.

00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:11.087
But they seem to like me in particular compared to Fuwawa.

00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:14.310
It's really embarrassing.

00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:24.130
You know, even when I try to sneak away from any big dogs approaching me when we go on our walks, they always end up running up to me and it makes me scared so I flinch and then hide behind Fuwawa.

00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:26.452
It's really embarrassing.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.395
It's embarrassing for me too, Ruffians.

00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:34.500
I'm sure the owner thinks I'm pretty funny, huh?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.060
Yeah.

00:13:37.342 --> 00:13:37.562
No.

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:38.964
Smaller dogs.

00:13:39.564 --> 00:13:39.925
Okay.

00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:41.426
Medium dogs.

00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:42.767
Okay.

00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:45.250
Extremely fluffy big dogs.

00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:48.813
Maybe okay if they have good manners.

00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:50.154
Okay.

00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:54.058
But for most big dogs, I like to keep my distance.

00:13:55.239 --> 00:13:57.841
I'm sorry if your doggy is a big dog.

00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:02.536
I like to keep a good distance between us until I'm used to them.

00:14:03.096 --> 00:14:04.718
Then we can be friends.

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:09.381
But until then, I'd like them to stay away from me.

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:11.083
It makes me nervous.

00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:16.127
But you know, Ruffians!

00:14:16.968 --> 00:14:18.128
Don't misunderstand, okay?

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:24.033
Because I'm a tough, big, demon guard dog, okay?

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.314
Don't misunderstand!

00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:27.176
I'm big.

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:28.217
I'm big.

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:29.886
I'm big!

00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:31.947
Got it.

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:34.668
Got it!

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:36.248
Yeah, right!

00:14:36.869 --> 00:14:37.889
Tough puppy.

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:38.589
I'm tough!

00:14:39.049 --> 00:14:39.649
I'm rough!

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.790
I'm big!

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:42.650
Got it.

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:45.171
BAU BAU!

00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:46.692
Do you feel better, Moco-chan?

00:14:47.752 --> 00:14:49.273
The Ruffians don't understand.

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:50.693
That makes me feel unhappy.

00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:57.330
I'll give a Ruffian some time and I should've come around, right?

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.290
You'll come around?

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.730
Yeah.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.812
Did you say so?

00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:04.173
I opened my heart.

00:15:05.413 --> 00:15:06.554
I opened my heart.

00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:07.955
You did.

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:09.115
You did.

00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:10.556
I should've come around.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.817
I'll accept it, okay?

00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:15.658
It's not a question, it's an answer.

00:15:15.678 --> 00:15:18.840
BAU BAU!

00:15:20.034 --> 00:15:23.676
Well, Ruffians, we have some happy news!

00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:26.157
Happy news!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.298
Now that Moco-chan's confessed, you feel a little bit lighter.

00:15:29.819 --> 00:15:33.180
Well, we can share some good news!

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.301
Happy news!

00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:41.164
Ruffians, Papa Puppy came by yesterday.

00:15:41.224 --> 00:15:44.845
And he came by with his two kids, too!

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:45.726
And guess what?

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:47.390
Guess what?

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.573
Moco-chan's chair is REVISED!

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:52.954
I have my arm back!

00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:55.316
It's huge!

00:15:55.396 --> 00:15:58.438
Moco-chan even found all the screws for the chair too!

00:15:58.578 --> 00:15:59.539
I'm amazing!

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.820
I have them all!

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.321
It's arm is back.

00:16:02.381 --> 00:16:02.962
It's fixed.

00:16:04.203 --> 00:16:12.850
For now, as Puppapuppi put it very ominously, he was actually even surprised that the other arm hadn't fallen off yet too.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:20.688
Actually, he did break a tool in the process of fixing it.

00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:27.535
There is a sacrifice for the revival of it.

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:32.119
Let's see maybe how many Donkey Kong Country themes it will take until it breaks?

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:33.640
Maybe?

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:35.903
Can we not do that?

00:16:38.382 --> 00:16:39.042
It'll be okay.

00:16:39.283 --> 00:16:41.924
How many more Donkey Kong Country sims do we even have?

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:42.925
We're almost done, right?

00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:45.947
I don't know, we go pretty bananas.

00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:49.069
The chair will be okay.

00:16:49.229 --> 00:16:49.730
BAU BAU!

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.633
Happy new, happy news!

00:16:54.653 --> 00:16:55.934
Welcome back, chair arm.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:56.994
BAU BAU!

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:06.074
It's weird having the orange back, but it's happy.

00:17:06.094 --> 00:17:07.815
More happy stuff, right?

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:09.276
Ruffians!

00:17:14.758 --> 00:17:19.299
You were there with us early yesterday when we played holo no Suika, right?

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:19.860
It was a lot of fun, right?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.100
It was fun.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.220
Right!

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.360
Right!

00:17:20.972 --> 00:17:22.395
It was a lot of fun, right?

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.016
It was fun.

00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:23.597
Right!

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:24.960
High score!

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.282
High score, yeah!

00:17:26.302 --> 00:17:27.444
High score!

00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:28.000
10,000!

00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:30.931
Number 1 is Mococo!

00:17:32.394 --> 00:17:32.714
Yeah.

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:34.037
Well, well fused.

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:39.487
There was a little bit of a misunderstanding there too.

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:41.531
Just a little bit.

00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:47.846
So, we feel like we need to clear things up so that no more misunderstandings.

00:17:48.406 --> 00:17:51.508
Well, our beloved senpai was there, right?

00:17:52.368 --> 00:18:00.913
And Moco-chan might have accidentally said things like, you know, we have to get rid of this senpai or there's a lot of garbage.

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:03.175
Referring to our senpai.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.924
Moco-chan, it's just all a misunderstanding, right?

00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:07.885
It's a misunderstanding!

00:18:07.925 --> 00:18:11.668
You know, it's garbage in an affectionate way.

00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:14.049
That's the way you use it.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.772
Yeah, like garbage can make a lot of amazing things, right?

00:18:17.812 --> 00:18:19.013
Like jewelry and...

00:18:20.154 --> 00:18:21.614
You're just garbage to me!

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:22.535
You're just garbage to me!

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:56.268
Ruffians, you're good with that, right?

00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:59.270
But see, this is exactly it.

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:00.952
Ruffians, you understand, right?

00:19:01.232 --> 00:19:03.975
That's why garbage is an endearing term.

00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:05.256
Yeah, just like useless.

00:19:05.536 --> 00:19:07.358
I say that a lot when playing games.

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:08.539
You're useless.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.762
You called me useless before too, but it's endearing.

00:19:11.822 --> 00:19:12.843
But I like you.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:15.335
No misunderstandings!

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:15.835
It's good.

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:16.416
We love A.I.

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:17.936
Senpai very much.

00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:18.516
Lots of respect.

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:19.056
That's A.I.

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:20.056
Senpai, okay?

00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:21.297
No misunderstandings!

00:19:21.317 --> 00:19:21.537
BAU BAU!

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.061
You love garbage.

00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:40.802
The Ruffians are garbage.

00:19:55.865 --> 00:19:57.547
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:20:19.474 --> 00:20:19.854
Raspberries.

00:20:19.894 --> 00:20:21.274
Frozen raspberries.

00:20:21.615 --> 00:20:22.475
And you take this.

00:20:23.195 --> 00:20:24.255
You add some milk.

00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:26.336
And then you get this!

00:20:27.076 --> 00:20:28.016
Yummy!

00:20:28.116 --> 00:20:30.917
Frozen raspberries and milk!

00:20:30.957 --> 00:20:32.877
You crush them up and put milk on it.

00:20:33.278 --> 00:20:35.198
And then it becomes like an ice cream.

00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:36.118
It's so yummy!

00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:37.439
It's very good.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.400
We've been a bit addicted to it recently.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:41.780
Yeah.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.000
We really like sweet and sour things.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.281
Raspberries are just that.

00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:46.021
Yeah!

00:20:47.096 --> 00:20:51.259
Moco-chan has to have her own bag, and I have to have my own bag too.

00:21:05.188 --> 00:21:09.350
There's no confusion, and no one steals each other's raspberries when they're not looking.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.592
I know there's the ice cream machines, but it's fine, just using arm power, you know.

00:21:14.612 --> 00:21:16.632
Squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish.

00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:18.593
Yeah, and then just mix it all up.

00:21:19.313 --> 00:21:19.714
Ice cream.

00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:22.815
Do you think you'll try it, Ruffian?

00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:25.616
Never tried it, but it sounds delicious.

00:21:25.656 --> 00:21:26.216
It is!

00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:27.417
You should try it!

00:21:27.437 --> 00:21:27.557
Honey!

00:21:27.817 --> 00:21:29.357
You don't need honey for it.

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:29.897
No honey.

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:31.318
Just milk and raspberries.

00:21:31.378 --> 00:21:32.518
Right, the raspberries.

00:21:32.719 --> 00:21:33.179
Soy milk!

00:21:35.868 --> 00:21:37.028
Not soy milk, maybe.

00:21:37.048 --> 00:21:38.349
Something a bit more milky.

00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:40.050
A bit more milky.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.611
Yeah, it's almost like a milkshake, but ice cream.

00:21:43.012 --> 00:21:43.592
Right.

00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:44.652
You should try it.

00:21:44.692 --> 00:21:46.193
You should try it.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:51.116
Yeah, it's oishii.

00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:52.477
It's oishii.

00:21:52.517 --> 00:21:53.017
Yes.

00:21:53.237 --> 00:21:54.138
We recommend.

00:21:54.238 --> 00:21:57.820
Yes, our big recommendation of today, Friday.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.322
Friday is Frozen Raspberry Day.

00:22:02.382 --> 00:22:04.163
BAU BAU!

00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:08.286
Well, let's move on to our regular corner, Moco-chan.

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:12.890
Today we have another Doggie of the Day!

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.871
Who's the doggy today?

00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:16.132
De-den!

00:22:16.152 --> 00:22:19.274
It's Hazel!

00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:24.497
She's 13 years old and pretty cranky.

00:22:24.578 --> 00:22:29.240
I guess 13 years of wisdom can get someone pretty cranky.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.281
But here she is.

00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:33.203
She's here with her favorite hot dog toy.

00:22:33.283 --> 00:22:34.003
Hot dog.

00:22:34.023 --> 00:22:35.064
She wants her privacy.

00:22:35.924 --> 00:22:38.886
Don't get too close to her and her favorite toy, right?

00:22:39.607 --> 00:22:41.368
She does look a bit big.

00:22:41.848 --> 00:22:44.249
But she also sort of looks like a hot dog.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.370
A spicy hot dog.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.291
A spicy hot dog.

00:22:48.792 --> 00:22:49.794
Cute.

00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:51.236
How does she BAU BAU?

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:55.022
You know, maybe like a BAU BAU and she's really excited for her hotdog?

00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:58.487
You know like... BAU BAU!

00:22:59.188 --> 00:22:59.889
BAU BAU!

00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:01.632
Give me the hotdog BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:02.213
Like that?

00:23:02.233 --> 00:23:02.313
Yeah.

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.047
I'm sure, yes.

00:23:22.438 --> 00:23:23.958
That's why her crankiness is good.

00:23:23.998 --> 00:23:25.599
She can protect you.

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:26.779
She can help, you know?

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:27.559
It's good.

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:30.100
Crankiness is extra protection skill.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.200
It's a good thing.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.681
Yeah, but just make sure that you don't get in between her and her hotdog time.

00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:36.721
No, no, no.

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:38.121
Precious hotdog time.

00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:38.981
Precious hotdog.

00:23:39.122 --> 00:23:39.742
Don't touch.

00:23:40.102 --> 00:23:40.942
BAU BAU!

00:23:41.082 --> 00:23:47.383
Did a Ruffian go on to a nice walk?

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:48.884
Let's see!

00:23:49.404 --> 00:23:50.284
De-den!

00:23:52.382 --> 00:23:53.823
Is this a painting?

00:23:54.124 --> 00:23:54.925
Is this real?

00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:56.306
Is this real life?

00:23:57.087 --> 00:23:58.208
It's beautiful!

00:23:58.368 --> 00:24:01.031
It's really, really beautiful.

00:24:02.212 --> 00:24:05.095
Why didn't you just stop there and live there forever?

00:24:07.057 --> 00:24:08.258
It's so pretty, right?

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:11.501
I think I would just cry if I saw this in real life.

00:24:12.922 --> 00:24:18.326
Sights like this make you really grateful for the passing seasons and passing time.

00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:18.907
Right!

00:24:18.967 --> 00:24:20.788
It makes you feel alive too!

00:24:20.948 --> 00:24:22.690
Too many bugs, that's not important.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.530
It's beautiful.

00:24:24.011 --> 00:24:26.032
Don't worry about the bugs when it's this beautiful.

00:24:27.193 --> 00:24:30.654
I think this probably has to be one of the best wall shots from the Ruffians so far.

00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:32.054
It's really beautiful.

00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:32.495
Right?

00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:35.235
All those leaves, every single leaf is yellow.

00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:37.456
And then the blue skies.

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:39.937
It's amazing.

00:24:40.137 --> 00:24:42.077
A beautiful walk indeed.

00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:44.078
Hopefully we can go on more walks here.

00:24:44.638 --> 00:24:45.338
It's very nice.

00:24:45.878 --> 00:24:46.518
BAU BAU!

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:52.341
And finally, for our Question of the Day!

00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:56.224
We have... De-den!

00:24:57.104 --> 00:25:01.487
How long did it take you to decide on Ruffians as your fan name while you were in the cell?

00:25:01.928 --> 00:25:05.930
Are you able to share any of the other names you were considering before deciding?

00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:11.194
It took us a little while to figure it out, but I think Moco-chan, you mentioned it before?

00:25:11.214 --> 00:25:13.015
I mentioned it before, just a little bit.

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:17.338
But it was the first thing that came to Moco-chan's mind when she woke up one moment.

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:18.039
Yeah!

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:19.060
I woke up.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.421
I literally woke up.

00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:22.723
And then I was like, Ruffians.

00:25:23.804 --> 00:25:27.146
Even before she said good morning or anything to me.

00:25:27.387 --> 00:25:29.989
But before that we had some ideas.

00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:31.790
Fluffer, fluffer was one of them.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.232
But Mari-chan said it's not the best.

00:25:34.252 --> 00:25:38.696
Yeah, because you know, when you fluzzers right, it has to be equal so it doesn't work.

00:25:40.197 --> 00:25:40.557
Ruffians.

00:25:40.577 --> 00:25:40.978
Abyssians.

00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:41.638
Doggie Pack.

00:25:41.658 --> 00:25:42.078
Doggie Pack.

00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:03.972
It's a very warm winter's night.

00:26:05.092 --> 00:26:07.214
I think it's only Ruffians.

00:26:08.374 --> 00:26:10.696
Very rough, very soft.

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:11.336
Special.

00:26:11.476 --> 00:26:11.897
BAU BAU!

00:26:11.917 --> 00:26:18.121
We like Ruffians too because you're a Ruffian so you can't change that.

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:19.581
What about kerfluffians though?

00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:20.382
Kerfluffians?

00:26:20.422 --> 00:26:22.403
Kerfluffians!

00:26:25.745 --> 00:26:27.668
Doggy, doggy, doggy days.

00:26:43.687 --> 00:26:47.868
Thank you everyone.

00:26:48.368 --> 00:26:50.309
Please don't forget to use the hashtag.

00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:54.590
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.170
You thought too.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.270
BAU BAU!

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.371
Thank you!

00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:05.292
Our next stream, we have another stream coming up.

00:27:08.217 --> 00:27:09.739
We got a new job, Ruffians!

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.301
Our job is... We have two jobs now.

00:27:11.321 --> 00:27:12.822
To protect your smile, and we have to work...

00:27:22.353 --> 00:27:24.756
Part-time at the convenience store.

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:27.139
Do we at least get to sample the new products?

00:27:37.933 --> 00:27:40.794
Do we get to have the food that's left over and gonna expire?

00:27:40.814 --> 00:27:41.934
That would be nice, no?

00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:42.634
Yeah.

00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:45.035
If we do that, can we get promoted to tengchou?

00:27:45.055 --> 00:27:46.595
By eating the leftover food?

00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:48.356
I guess it helps with waste.

00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:49.236
Yeah!

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:51.897
But we'll do our best, Ruffians!

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:55.138
We'll do our best to make every customer that comes in smile!

00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:55.738
Yeah!

00:27:55.758 --> 00:27:57.718
This is our convenience store!

00:27:57.778 --> 00:27:58.499
And you too!

00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:01.719
We need to make a lasting impression.

00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:02.100
Yeah.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.140
BAU BAU!

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.941
And our schedule!

00:28:07.912 --> 00:28:10.795
Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:12.537
We're excited!

00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:14.479
We're hyped!

00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:17.242
It's gonna be very spooky and silly.

00:28:26.027 --> 00:28:30.889
You know we're gonna sing a lot of songs that make us feel a bit of shiver when we hear them.

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:31.609
Shiver.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.251
So we hope that you feel that way too.

00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.632
We're gonna make the Ruffians shiver.

00:28:37.892 --> 00:28:40.533
We're gonna make the hair on your arms stand up.

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:42.774
Maybe.

00:28:42.814 --> 00:28:43.394
Maybe.

00:28:43.654 --> 00:28:46.455
Do we have like a recommended drink of choice for the moment?

00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:48.435
To enjoy while walking or partying?

00:28:48.475 --> 00:28:52.416
It's a Halloween special, so... I guess apple juice or apple cider?

00:28:52.436 --> 00:28:56.117
Yummy full tasting!

00:28:56.277 --> 00:29:02.158
But we're really excited because we'll be singing a few songs that we really didn't think we'd ever be able to sing for you!

00:29:02.178 --> 00:29:03.498
We prepared specially!

00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:07.199
Yeah, we prepared them specially so that we could sing them for you.

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.680
Made specifically for FUWAMOCO.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.160
Yeah.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.220
It sounds really good.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.601

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.126
We've reached the end of the week!

00:29:29.346 --> 00:29:31.067
The end of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:31.107 --> 00:29:31.827
We did it!

00:29:31.867 --> 00:29:33.548
The end of the week, Ruffians!

00:29:34.368 --> 00:29:41.311
