00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:10.898
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:14.700
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.963
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.983 --> 00:05:21.043
BAU!

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:24.785
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.966
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:30.267
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:30.307 --> 00:05:31.488
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.055
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:38.677
Ruffians!

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.019
Good morning!

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.006
Thank you for waking up and joining us for our 52nd episode today!

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:45.427
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:50.969
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.568 --> 00:06:23.170
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.012
BAU BAU!

00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:26.993
Moco-chan.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.374
Was it a Pero Sighting?

00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:31.336
Did we see Pero in all Ruffians?

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:33.237
Apparently!

00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:35.599
One Ruffian did see Pero.

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:37.880
Let's see where he was found!

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.020
De-den!

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:45.818
Wait.

00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:46.998
Pero.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.979
Pero's trapped there underneath the ice.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:52.080
He's not having fun, huh?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.101
He must be cold.

00:06:58.383 --> 00:06:59.223
Look closely.

00:06:59.823 --> 00:07:01.084
Closely at his face.

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:03.004
Deep into his eyes.

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:05.165
Ruffians.

00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:07.166
Can you hear his screams?

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:07.566
I can.

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.361
And something else.

00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:18.042
This Ruffian suggests that Pero went for a swim.

00:07:18.743 --> 00:07:22.783
And that, you know, he made a mistake because he didn't realize it was freezing out.

00:07:22.803 --> 00:07:24.064
That's a big mistake.

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:30.365
Yeah, they end off the tweet with a, I hope he is alright, period.

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:31.865
I don't know.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.306
That sounds sort of suspicious.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:34.586
Why?

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:37.642
Maybe it's not a genuine concern.

00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:41.085
He could be like, I hope he has a right exclamation mark!

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.427
I hope he's good there!

00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:46.411
It's almost like you tricked him.

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.133
Try to trap him there.

00:07:48.153 --> 00:07:51.817
I didn't want to say it, but... You wouldn't do that, right?

00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:52.558
Right!

00:07:55.407 --> 00:08:08.351
Well, uh, Pero, you know he's very abundantly round and snow-colored, so he does pretty well in the winter already, but... Let's hope he escapes your icy pool soon!

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:09.112
Yeah.

00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:12.233
You make sure nothing else gets dropped in there, okay?

00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:14.914
Yeah, yeah, it's a hazard.

00:08:15.014 --> 00:08:15.514
And you!

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:18.255
Stay warm yourself too, okay?

00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:21.836
BAU BAU!

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:22.996
BAU BAU!

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.137
Pero be good.

00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:27.956
Oh boy, oh boy.

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:29.957
BAU BAU.

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:36.519
Well, you know, it's officially the holiday season, Ruffians.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:36.759
It is!

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:42.521
And to celebrate, the long-awaited hololive Christmas voice packs are out!

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:47.923
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:51.244
You know, and of course, of course,

00:08:52.359 --> 00:09:03.108
FUWAMOCO went participating in it!

00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:06.231
We did our best to record them both in English and Japanese.

00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.554
So we hope that you'll check both of them out and spend Christmas together with us.

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:18.821
We always have so much fun with the voice packs so we hope that you enjoy them as much as we do too.

00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.462
Oh boy!

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:23.136
Thank you!

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:24.579
Thank you!

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:34.536
Also, you know, this time it was especially special to us because we got to think about what kind of Christmas that we want to spend together with you.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:42.450
And, you know, we put all of the excitement and the feelings into these voice packs, so please take a listen, okay?

00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:42.961
Thank you

00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:49.968
And also, we know how hard all of Advent like to record both in English and Japanese.

00:09:50.008 --> 00:09:52.370
So we hope that you'll check them out, okay?

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.653
It's not everyday you get to hear them speaking in Japanese.

00:09:55.974 --> 00:10:00.078
I mean, we, we sometimes, sometimes speak in Japanese.

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:04.422
But you know, all the other Advent members, not that often.

00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:05.703
Look at Nerissa there!

00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:05.943
So cute!

00:10:20.418 --> 00:10:25.801
I wonder what her feelings were when it was getting taken like that.

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:28.262
But you can take out samples on the website too, okay?

00:10:28.302 --> 00:10:28.722
Right!

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:29.543
Samples!

00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:31.084
I love samples.

00:10:31.224 --> 00:10:31.944
Stamples.

00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:33.785
Stamples.

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:35.426
That's what you said.

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:39.068
BAU BAU!

00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:43.170
Voice box is fun.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.431
There's more exciting news about the fun stuff!

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:49.448
Ina-senpai!

00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:56.772
Ina-senpai is having her birthday CD concert!

00:10:56.832 --> 00:10:57.312
BAU BAU!

00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:58.513
Ina-senpai dunk!

00:10:59.313 --> 00:11:00.474
Ina-senpai dunk!

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:04.596
The concert's gonna be on Saturday, December 9th at 5PM PT or 10AM JST.

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:13.131
Ino-senpai's birthday was back in May, so it's a bit of a belated birthday.

00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:15.474
Belated birthday, but still very, very happy.

00:11:15.594 --> 00:11:20.279
Nonetheless, it's super exciting for all of us, especially the takodachi, too.

00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:26.524
We're excited to see what she's going to do and what she might be performing as well.

00:11:26.564 --> 00:11:32.808
We really love Ino-san's voice and her atmosphere, but I really, really love her dancing as well.

00:11:32.968 --> 00:11:33.228
I do too!

00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:34.749
I want to see it!

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.290
Don't miss it, okay, Ruffians?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.612
We'll be live right after with Super Mario World.

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:42.714
As soon as it ends, too.

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:44.475
Mario Bros Wonder, which one is it?

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:45.816
What did you say?

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:48.737
Super Mario Wonder and Mario Bros Wonder.

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:51.818
I thought you said Mario Kart Wonder.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:52.678
That's not right.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:54.599
It's not right.

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:56.480
We're with the Mario Wonder.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.361
Mario Brothers Wonder.

00:11:58.461 --> 00:11:59.381
Okay, thank you.

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:02.542
BAU BAU!

00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.603
BAU BAU!

00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:12.714
Not just that, you know, there's a lot of exciting things going on.

00:12:12.814 --> 00:12:16.336
And this one, we kind of talked about it about two weeks ago.

00:12:16.356 --> 00:12:17.337
Sort of recently.

00:12:17.377 --> 00:12:24.481
Yeah, but hololive right now currently has an official shop for a limited time in Tokyo Station!

00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:25.322
Yeah!

00:12:25.362 --> 00:12:26.983
In Tokyo Character Street.

00:12:27.063 --> 00:12:28.884
Some images.

00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:30.125
Yeah, a pop-up store.

00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:33.607
It's located in the basement of Tokyo Station.

00:12:34.047 --> 00:12:36.489
And yeah, that's part of the Tokyo Character Street.

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:43.413
You know, it's filled with stores of famous brands like Hello Kitty, Pokemon, Pretty Cure, you know?

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:44.094
Pretty Cure!

00:12:44.454 --> 00:12:45.675
All those cool things.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:50.638
And you can find IRyS-senpai is the Tokyo Tourism Ambassador.

00:12:50.658 --> 00:12:53.620
You know, Mikochi-senpai, Karin-senpai, Gura-senpai.

00:12:54.021 --> 00:12:57.143
And they're there to greet you with new goodies!

00:12:57.683 --> 00:13:02.026
And you know, you can find other merch from other hololive members there as well, too!

00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:02.386
But!

00:13:03.007 --> 00:13:04.568
We talked about that before, but!

00:13:05.448 --> 00:13:06.049
Actually!

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.092
Starting on the 6th.

00:13:08.212 --> 00:13:10.396
That's like tomorrow in Japan, right?

00:13:10.976 --> 00:13:11.237
No.

00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:12.018
Yeah!

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:13.921
Because it just became the 5th.

00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:16.456
I guess it is tomorrow.

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:20.478
But tomorrow, yes!

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:23.659
You can find advent there too, but only if you're lucky.

00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:38.404
Yeah, with every purchase of 3,300 yen, maybe $30, you might be able to get a special novelty card with an advent member or reglass member on it.

00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:43.246
Unfortunately, there isn't any Advent merch there to buy.

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:49.189
But we do really hope that there will be merch for Adventrix to get their paws on in the future.

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:51.610
You know, we're still new so I guess it can't be helped.

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:53.544
Merchandise.

00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:58.210
Advent merchandise.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.032
Actually, those novelty cards.

00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:06.659
Those are the very first place ever that you can see our signatures, Ruffians.

00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:09.042
Our signatures!

00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:10.043
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:18.077
Ruffians, we know how many are printed, so good luck!

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:36.993
Yeah.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:45.617
You might also be able to hear the Regulus members doing in-store announcements when they're too doing this limited period of time, you know?

00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:49.199
Like, oh, please check out this, or oh, I'm this member, you know?

00:14:49.219 --> 00:14:50.099
Those kind of things.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.760
Yeah.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.461
Don't you think that's so fun?

00:14:52.481 --> 00:14:54.301
Yeah, actually, no.

00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:58.904
It's sort of a hidden skill of mine, but I'm really good.

00:14:58.924 --> 00:14:59.004
What?

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:00.684
It is a skill.

00:15:01.225 --> 00:15:03.646
I'm really good at doing store announcements.

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:07.127
I think it would've been really fun!

00:15:07.487 --> 00:15:12.828
Moco-chan, sometimes this is the point where it's like, oh, we go to a store and you hear the in-store announcement.

00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:15.228
Yes, and I get a bit, a bit angry.

00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:17.069
More energy!

00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:18.149
More energy!

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:19.589
Make it interesting!

00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:20.089
Right!

00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:23.150
The store is closing in five minutes!

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.991
Please make your way to the closest register.

00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.371
Thank you, and have a good night.

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:31.192
You know it!

00:15:33.144 --> 00:15:35.146
It's a skill one.

00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:38.108
Yeah, I want to direct you where to go.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.532
We hope that you'll check it out if you're visiting Japan soon, Ruffians.

00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:48.915
And good luck to those trying to get our novelty cards.

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:54.319
We did put lots of love into them, so hopefully it can reach your paws, too.

00:15:55.043 --> 00:15:56.104
BAU BAU!

00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:56.604
I forgot.

00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:58.445
This is what they look like.

00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:00.667
You know you can see Shiori's sample there.

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:01.787
A bit of a sample.

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:04.049
At her signature!

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:05.309
But always a secret.

00:16:05.349 --> 00:16:06.710
It's a secret.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.191
I guess.

00:16:09.072 --> 00:16:10.032
I guess it's a secret.

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:11.733
Why is always a secret?

00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:15.794
Shiori's the leader, she doesn't get to keep secrets.

00:16:17.515 --> 00:16:18.856
That's why.

00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:25.179
Yeah, but we... I don't know, there's a lot of white space on Shiori's in comparison to ours.

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:26.659
Which is probably good.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.221
I think we made it difficult.

00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:31.041
Yeah.

00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:34.703
We might have been a bit rough on the staff or something.

00:16:35.023 --> 00:16:35.523
Just a bit.

00:16:35.764 --> 00:16:36.264
Yeah.

00:16:37.004 --> 00:16:39.325
Please try to get your paws on the Ruffians!

00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:39.925
BAU BAU!

00:16:43.964 --> 00:16:45.625
Next, you know, Ruffians.

00:16:46.446 --> 00:16:46.786
Today.

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:46.906
Today!

00:16:47.587 --> 00:16:48.047
Today!

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:52.289
Is that what you wanted?

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.990
Yeah.

00:16:54.791 --> 00:17:01.575
Today is not December 1st anymore, but it's the first Monday of December.

00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:03.917
Which is pretty much the start of December.

00:17:03.937 --> 00:17:07.939
The first full week of the final month of the year.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.901
How has your December been so far, Ruffians?

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:16.943
If it could've started better, don't wait, okay?

00:17:17.043 --> 00:17:20.087
Just pretend that today is the first day of the month, okay?

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:25.012
And do your best to make December into the month that you can be the most proud of this year, okay?

00:17:25.032 --> 00:17:32.421
Yeah, you know, it's cold so you might feel like you just want to kind of curl up and take it easy, but don't give in!

00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:33.982
Don't give in, okay?

00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:34.562
Get going!

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:37.044
And do those things you want to do.

00:17:37.084 --> 00:17:40.767
Yeah, I know FUWAMOCO will be doing the same.

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:47.633
So let's do our best and really have a ton of fun celebrating at the end of the year here in just a few weeks.

00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:51.356
There's gonna be so many exciting things!

00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:52.237
BAU BAU!

00:17:53.978 --> 00:17:55.259
Are you excited?

00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.406
All the month has been good so far.

00:17:58.466 --> 00:17:59.227
Oh, that's good.

00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:00.907
Well, it's just gonna get better.

00:18:01.287 --> 00:18:02.588
You have the bed right now.

00:18:02.908 --> 00:18:04.608
You're in bed right now.

00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:05.848
You have a... That's good.

00:18:06.048 --> 00:18:09.149
You have until the end of FUWAMOCO Morning to get out of bed.

00:18:09.469 --> 00:18:09.790
What?

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.410
What if they're going to sleep though?

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.592
Oh, if that's the case, then stay in bed.

00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:21.593
BAU BAU!

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:22.553
Ruffians!

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:29.268
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make all together, right?

00:18:29.348 --> 00:18:30.009
Right!

00:18:31.492 --> 00:18:31.973
Well...

00:18:32.782 --> 00:18:35.383
We'd like to ask a little bit more of you.

00:18:35.543 --> 00:18:36.543
That's all right.

00:18:36.703 --> 00:18:38.984
We need your help, okay?

00:18:39.224 --> 00:18:49.007
We need you to let us know if something exciting or silly or interesting happened during our Ien-senpai's streams or on Twitter.

00:18:49.207 --> 00:18:52.328
Let us know, okay, with the Twitter new hashtag.

00:18:53.448 --> 00:18:57.150
Hashtag FUWAMOCO scoop!

00:18:58.451 --> 00:18:58.992
Yeah!

00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:00.893
FUWAMOCO scoop!

00:19:02.054 --> 00:19:07.177
Yeah, for anything, you know, you see something interesting or silly going on, we want to know about it!

00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:08.778
You want to know, let us know!

00:19:08.798 --> 00:19:20.205
We want to be able to include more about Ien-sanpai and other Advent members during FUWAMOCO Morning, but, you know, sometimes it's kind of hard for us to gather all the news during real time.

00:19:21.005 --> 00:19:23.426
I didn't realize.

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:24.466
What?

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:32.867
So, Ruffians, we'll need your help to let us know when there is a scoop that we should kinda dig into.

00:19:33.228 --> 00:19:39.229
Or maybe something celebratory going on that maybe us and other Ruffians might have missed.

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:45.470
We'll do our best to include your scoop and let all the other Ruffians know just how on the beat you are with hololive English, okay?

00:19:46.911 --> 00:19:51.394
Let's continue to evolve FUWAMOCO Morning together, okay, Ruffians?

00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:53.056
BAU BAU!

00:19:53.136 --> 00:19:53.836
Reporters!

00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:56.158
Are you reporters or are you detectives?

00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:59.581
That's up to you, what kind of journalism you want to provide!

00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:03.685
BAU BAU!

00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:10.210
I don't know, I'm kind of feeling a little bit more festive now.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.851
It's very December.

00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:13.613
Very December!

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:21.646
But, you know, the other day, Mama Puppy, Mama Puppy came by and visited us Ruffians.

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:26.168
You know, she kind of surprised us by saying she wanted to visit suddenly.

00:20:26.628 --> 00:20:31.271
But then, it's okay, she'll be really quick because she knows how busy we are and everything.

00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:33.872
Well, you know what she did?

00:20:35.353 --> 00:20:38.955
She brought a whole bunch of Christmas things for us.

00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:44.657
Isn't that nice?

00:20:45.157 --> 00:20:50.742
I know there was some special advent calendars that we've had since we were puppies.

00:20:50.762 --> 00:20:54.465
A very special festive-smelling candle.

00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:58.768
And even a fully-decorated mini Christmas tree!

00:20:59.388 --> 00:20:59.969
It was funny.

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:02.751
Do you know why, Ruffians?

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:04.613
Any ideas?

00:21:05.788 --> 00:21:20.493
It's because we told Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy a while back that this Christmas is really important to us because, you know, it's the first Christmas that, well, Christmas and New Year, you know, that we get to spend with you!

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:30.377
With you, Ruffians, you know, and we want to be able to spend it with you as much as possible, so that's why Mama Puppy brought those by, so

00:21:30.657 --> 00:21:30.898
BAU BAU!

00:21:30.918 --> 00:21:31.118
BAU BAU!

00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:39.236
BAU BAU!

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:43.078
I'm looking forward to it so much.

00:22:08.164 --> 00:22:10.727
Well, there's a lot of fun and exciting things going on.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.369
Happy stuff, lots of good stuff, yes.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.014
But, unfortunately, Ruffians!

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:19.178
We had another misunderstanding.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:27.786
And actually, this time, I don't know Ruffians, you might not have actually noticed it.

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:30.188
Yeah, you might not know about it.

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:33.631
But, so, the other day, right?

00:22:34.432 --> 00:22:38.395
We had our Love Live and Idol Master Only Rock n' Rawr Party, right?

00:22:39.296 --> 00:22:45.842
And doing one song, Koi ni Naritai Aquarium, we did something a bit different because it's fun!

00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:46.562
It's fun!

00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:48.804
Rock n' Rawr parties are fun!

00:22:49.085 --> 00:22:49.565
Right!

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:59.834
You know, you might have heard us talk about it before, Ruffians, but often for idol lives, there are special words that fans shout out from the audience called calls.

00:23:01.075 --> 00:23:02.556
You know, BAU BAU BAU.

00:23:04.178 --> 00:23:05.359
You've heard them before, right?

00:23:08.823 --> 00:23:09.343
You have.

00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:10.384
Right, right?

00:23:10.504 --> 00:23:11.724
Yes, calls, calls.

00:23:11.864 --> 00:23:12.704
Right.

00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:16.025
Yeah.

00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:20.887
But, I guess usually, they're at a certain time in the progression of the song.

00:23:21.327 --> 00:23:23.328
And, you know, sometimes they're followed with movements.

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:27.029
And, you know, they can sometimes be a bit distracting for some people.

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:28.029
A little bit, maybe.

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:30.190
Yeah, a bit distracting.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.611
But for some, it's really fun and makes you a part of the performance.

00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:34.452
BAU BAU!

00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:49.505
Yeah, tiger.

00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:50.246
Yeah, tiger.

00:23:50.266 --> 00:23:51.087
Yeah, tiger.

00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:51.967
Yeah, tiger.

00:23:52.107 --> 00:23:52.328
Yeah.

00:23:52.408 --> 00:23:53.048
Yeah.

00:23:53.268 --> 00:23:53.548
Yeah.

00:24:15.485 --> 00:24:20.411
Actually, Ruffians, you're not allowed to use this call at official performances.

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:28.802
So if you saw us at our Rock n' Rawr Party and thought, oh, I can go to Tokyo Dome this next week and say, yay, Taiga!

00:24:28.822 --> 00:24:31.505
Sorry, you definitely can't.

00:24:34.329 --> 00:24:35.409
You know what you can do?

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:36.970
Yes, you can what?

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.530
You can yank Tiger during our Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.270
Yes, yes!

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.191
Because Aqua isn't there.

00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:43.211
Too bad.

00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:44.331
Yeah, it's not.

00:24:44.711 --> 00:24:45.511
It's just FUWAMOCO.

00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:46.432
It's just FUWAMOCO.

00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:47.872
You'll have to be okay with us.

00:24:47.912 --> 00:24:53.873
Yeah, and you know Rock n' Rawr Parties aren't held in big venues with lots of venue staff and acoustics.

00:24:53.953 --> 00:24:55.013
It's just our studio, you know?

00:24:55.153 --> 00:24:59.594
Yeah, we don't have any acoustics where the sound travels at different speeds, you know?

00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:02.555
Yeah, it won't cause any issues with us.

00:25:03.075 --> 00:25:04.135
Yeah, because we're the performers.

00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:04.935
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:05.095 --> 00:25:13.117
And I don't think it's going to cause any issues with the Ruffians next to you because I'm pretty sure they're far enough away that they can't hear you.

00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:13.997
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:17.938
But... It's okay.

00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:18.718
I can't believe it.

00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:19.598
You can't do it.

00:25:19.698 --> 00:25:21.959
It's because it's not allowed, okay?

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:22.439
Yeah.

00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:23.399
You can't do it.

00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.720
But rock n' rawr parties, it's okay.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.540
It's okay.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.201
But yeah, I can't believe Moco-chan got in trouble with the Yei Taiga police on Twitter.

00:25:33.345 --> 00:25:34.526
We were just having fun.

00:25:35.327 --> 00:25:35.747
Sorry.

00:25:36.127 --> 00:25:37.288
Sorry, Yetiiger, please.

00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:38.269
Yetiiger!

00:25:38.409 --> 00:25:39.810
What?

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.171
BAU BAU.

00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:42.532
We were just having fun.

00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:44.233
Not officially, you cannot.

00:25:44.393 --> 00:25:44.713
Okay?

00:25:44.754 --> 00:25:46.095
Not officially, no.

00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:46.675
Okay?

00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:49.257
No, but at Rock n' Rawr Parties, yes.

00:25:49.317 --> 00:25:50.358
At karaoke, yes.

00:25:50.578 --> 00:25:54.080
If you want to sleep during a Rock n' Rawr Party, that's okay.

00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:58.344
If you want to just wail during a Rock n' Rawr Party, that's okay.

00:25:58.604 --> 00:25:59.104
Yeah.

00:25:59.945 --> 00:26:01.046
Okay.

00:26:01.086 --> 00:26:02.046
You don't get it!

00:26:03.327 --> 00:26:04.008
It makes sense.

00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:04.968
It's loud.

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:05.509
It's loud.

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:06.209
It's distracting.

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:07.190
It's distracting.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:07.791
Yeah.

00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:08.171
Yeah.

00:26:08.411 --> 00:26:08.831
Okay.

00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:10.412
BAU BAU!

00:26:10.473 --> 00:26:12.814
BAU BAU!

00:26:15.897 --> 00:26:15.997
Sorry!

00:26:16.297 --> 00:26:18.578
Moco-chan, it's that time of the day!

00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:21.481
The start of a new week, the first week of December.

00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:22.661
I woke up!

00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:25.744
I woke up and you know what the first thing I said was?

00:26:27.395 --> 00:26:29.877
Oh no, this is the day I have to eat natto, right?

00:26:30.417 --> 00:26:30.837
It was.

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:35.000
I don't want to eat natto today.

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.822
Moco-chan!

00:26:38.942 --> 00:26:43.926
It's time for you to challenge eating natto again, you know.

00:26:44.966 --> 00:26:47.928
It's the first week, the first Monday of December.

00:26:48.709 --> 00:26:51.871
And I don't know about you, but natto makes me feel extra festive.

00:26:52.431 --> 00:26:53.192
Ruffians.

00:26:53.652 --> 00:26:55.233
Ruffians.

00:26:56.107 --> 00:27:00.951
Will Santa come visit me more if I eat more natto?

00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.453
I heard that Santa loves natto.

00:27:04.013 --> 00:27:05.654
Yeah, he's from Tochigi.

00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:08.076
Yeah, Santa's from Tochigi?

00:27:09.017 --> 00:27:11.759
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, which one, Ruffians?

00:27:11.779 --> 00:27:18.084
No, but the Santa from Tochigi would like it even more if you had a natto mix with strawberries from Tochigi, too.

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:27.019
Well, Ruffians, today Moco-chan's gonna once again challenge eating natto.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:35.463
And if you don't know what natto is, natto is a fermented soybean that's a very common breakfast food in Japan because it's very healthy, very good for you.

00:27:35.503 --> 00:27:38.684
There's a healthy vitamin that you can only get from natto.

00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:45.087
But it's also very sticky and very smelly and slimy.

00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:46.560
It's difficult.

00:27:46.881 --> 00:27:48.182
But it's a superfood.

00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:54.170
And I want Moco-chan to be able to protect your smile for many, many years, just like me.

00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:58.737
So you're going to do your best today, Moco-chan, and eat the natto, okay?

00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:02.502
I even got more soy sauce for you, right?

00:28:03.972 --> 00:28:05.393
It was good last time with the soy sauce.

00:28:05.413 --> 00:28:06.634
No, it was too much with that.

00:28:07.114 --> 00:28:07.615
Oh, well.

00:28:08.315 --> 00:28:09.096
Wait, did you put it in?

00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:09.876
Did you put it in?

00:28:09.936 --> 00:28:10.697
I didn't put it in.

00:28:10.717 --> 00:28:11.357
Okay, good.

00:28:11.617 --> 00:28:15.420
Okay, well, I gotta get it all ready here.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.021
No, that's not the chopsticks I like either.

00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:24.886
And while I get it ready, Moco-chan, can you say a big thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who work hard to make this?

00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:28.348
Thank you, farmers in Tochigi who work hard to make the natto.

00:28:28.688 --> 00:28:31.150
I really appreciate it and I think it's really amazing.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.011
But, I'm not good with natto.

00:28:34.452 --> 00:28:35.012
It's done!

00:28:35.712 --> 00:28:38.914
I appreciate all your hard work, even though it's difficult for me.

00:28:39.054 --> 00:28:41.876
Moco-chan, I'm gonna help you this time, okay?

00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:42.936
No, please no.

00:28:42.976 --> 00:28:43.977
I don't need help!

00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:45.437
I don't need help!

00:28:45.497 --> 00:28:46.718
Here it goes, FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:28:46.778 --> 00:28:47.218
No, stop!

00:28:47.238 --> 00:28:47.779
Here it comes!

00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:50.180
I don't wanna throw it!

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.221
I don't wanna throw it!

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:56.463
If I put negi in it, it's waste, okay?

00:28:56.503 --> 00:28:57.963
Negi wa dame da yo!

00:28:57.983 --> 00:28:58.824
Negi ireta.

00:28:58.904 --> 00:28:59.804
No onions.

00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:03.445
Okay, I guess Moco-chan doesn't need help.

00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:05.886
I guess she's an old enough puppy.

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:09.367
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:29:09.587 --> 00:29:11.848
How many beans are you gonna- That's the smallest bean.

00:29:11.888 --> 00:29:12.928
It's like half a bean!

00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:14.809
There's two beans and they're big.

00:29:14.829 --> 00:29:16.590
Okay, she has two beans now.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.231
This is good.

00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:21.391
Don't make fun of the beans.

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:26.536
Are you ready, Moco-chan?

00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:27.736
I'm really not.

00:29:28.076 --> 00:29:34.838
Moco-chan, your face looks a little bit more blue than normal.

00:29:36.478 --> 00:29:37.038
Does it?

00:29:37.298 --> 00:29:37.838
Yeah.

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:41.099
Good luck!

00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:43.639
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:44.339
Here we go!

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:46.100
I just wanna drop it down my throat.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.300
That's all you have to do.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.960
Okay!

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.020
Three!

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.461
No, no, the smell overcame me!

00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:57.573
Moco-chan.

00:29:57.673 --> 00:29:58.093
Okay!

00:29:59.434 --> 00:30:00.715
How am I gonna do this?

00:30:00.975 --> 00:30:01.896
You're just gonna do it.

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:02.977
That's how you have to do it.

00:30:02.997 --> 00:30:04.438
I don't want to put it in my mouth!

00:30:04.518 --> 00:30:05.498
It's like bungee jumping!

00:30:05.518 --> 00:30:06.079
Okay, let's do this!

00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:06.459
No, no, no, no!

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:07.500
Don't go bungee jumping!

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.381
It's not just the smell, okay, Ruffians?

00:30:09.421 --> 00:30:09.601
Three!

00:30:09.801 --> 00:30:12.863
No, it's not just the smell, it's the taste!

00:30:12.883 --> 00:30:13.404
Two!

00:30:13.424 --> 00:30:15.745
When I chew it, it's bad.

00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:15.865
One!

00:30:15.986 --> 00:30:16.386
In it goes!

00:30:16.406 --> 00:30:16.706
In it goes!

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:17.086
In it goes!

00:30:17.106 --> 00:30:17.286
I can't!

00:30:17.306 --> 00:30:17.547
I can't!

00:30:17.567 --> 00:30:18.507
Moco-chan, do it!

00:30:18.627 --> 00:30:19.008
Do it!

00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:20.228
Chew it!

00:30:20.268 --> 00:30:23.190
My face moves away from it.

00:30:24.271 --> 00:30:24.531
Go!

00:30:25.052 --> 00:30:25.212
Go!

00:30:28.277 --> 00:30:30.439
Okay, okay, so close, so close, don't smell!

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.141
Just do it!

00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:34.223
You're making yourself hurt more!

00:30:34.243 --> 00:30:36.085
I can't.

00:30:36.405 --> 00:30:36.866
Why not?

00:30:36.886 --> 00:30:40.890
No, why are you just- Why are you doing that?

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.792
Why are you just-

00:30:45.284 --> 00:30:48.187
It didn't even... You just touched it!

00:30:48.287 --> 00:30:49.489
You just touched it!

00:30:49.609 --> 00:30:50.750
No, I can't do it!

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.911
I can't do it today!

00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:54.674
I touched it with my tongue and I can't do it!

00:30:54.734 --> 00:30:56.436
Ruffians, this is getting worse!

00:30:56.536 --> 00:30:59.158
That's not a normal reaction, Moco-chan!

00:30:59.178 --> 00:31:01.080
I touched it with my tongue!

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.103
Are you sure you're not feeling some trauma now?

00:31:04.344 --> 00:31:05.365
I can't do it!

00:31:07.352 --> 00:31:08.912
This is so much worse.

00:31:09.553 --> 00:31:10.813
Are you sure, Moco-chan?

00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:11.533
I can't.

00:31:11.713 --> 00:31:12.093
I can't.

00:31:12.173 --> 00:31:12.453
Don't.

00:31:12.593 --> 00:31:12.873
Don't.

00:31:13.033 --> 00:31:13.313
Don't.

00:31:13.573 --> 00:31:13.893
Stop.

00:31:14.014 --> 00:31:14.394
I'm done.

00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:15.634
Challenge over.

00:31:15.654 --> 00:31:17.254
I did my best.

00:31:17.974 --> 00:31:18.875
Happy December.

00:31:18.895 --> 00:31:24.596
This is going worse and worse, Ruffians.

00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:25.856
Happy December.

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:28.137
No, no, Santa is still.

00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:28.997
Santa is still.

00:31:30.762 --> 00:31:32.082
Santa is still okay.

00:31:32.782 --> 00:31:35.023
Mococo is progressing backwards.

00:31:35.323 --> 00:31:35.603
Yeah.

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:37.403
No, it's not December, no way!

00:31:37.423 --> 00:31:38.384
This is worse.

00:31:39.004 --> 00:31:40.284
No, I did my best.

00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:40.984
Thank you.

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:42.584
Thank you.

00:31:42.644 --> 00:31:43.345
Poor Natto.

00:31:43.765 --> 00:31:45.745
Moco-chan's not trying to be mean.

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:46.625
Eat it later, okay?

00:31:46.645 --> 00:31:48.606
Moco-chan's not trying to be mean.

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:49.686
You're delicious.

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:51.706
My sister is just silly.

00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:53.427
I'm not silly.

00:31:53.447 --> 00:31:54.647
Okay, well.

00:31:55.127 --> 00:31:55.987
I'm not silly!

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.148
I'm Mococo!

00:32:01.914 --> 00:32:02.554
Okay.

00:32:04.755 --> 00:32:05.355
You good?

00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:08.436
I don't want to get not delivered.

00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:09.436
There we go.

00:32:09.856 --> 00:32:11.056
Well, Ruffians!

00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:13.937
Let's head to our regular corner shop.

00:32:14.017 --> 00:32:16.357
Next we have Doggie of the Day!

00:32:16.377 --> 00:32:20.298
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:32:20.498 --> 00:32:22.579
Clementine!

00:32:22.699 --> 00:32:24.039
BAU BAU!

00:32:24.179 --> 00:32:25.540
So cute and sleepy.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.720
What an adorable dog.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.205
Look at the dots on her nose and her fuzzy, fuzzy ears!

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:31.645
Very cute.

00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:51.416
A very festive Clementine Christmas Orange, right?

00:32:52.116 --> 00:32:56.058
Yeah, she looks like she likes to curl up to the fire too.

00:32:56.738 --> 00:32:57.778
Very, very cute.

00:32:58.078 --> 00:32:59.399
Very cute.

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:02.379
How does Clementine BAU BAU?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.801
I think it would be a sweet and polite BAU BAU.

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:24.635
Oh, that's good Like that Kind of like if Karmontime was the Baobab Yeah Baobab Baobab But I feel like even though she looks sweet You know, if push was to come to shove Is that how it goes?

00:33:24.655 --> 00:33:35.429
I don't think it is She could do pretty well protecting I think so too I don't want her to have those kind of feelings though I want to protect Karmontime Yeah

00:33:35.594 --> 00:33:43.385
But you know Clementine, she's definitely been on her best behavior this year and is looking forward to what Santa might be bringing for her.

00:33:43.405 --> 00:33:43.845
Just like me!

00:33:44.844 --> 00:33:45.124
BAU BAU!

00:33:45.204 --> 00:33:47.105
And for today, I went on a walk with... De-den!

00:34:16.813 --> 00:34:17.714
It looks really cool.

00:34:17.734 --> 00:34:19.775
Look at the sky, it's all orange.

00:34:19.835 --> 00:34:20.775
But it's so dark.

00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:22.696
It looks a little bit spooky, right?

00:34:23.096 --> 00:34:24.577
But you know, you have a smoothie.

00:34:24.637 --> 00:34:26.618
You're funny!

00:34:26.758 --> 00:34:28.639
Not spooky if you have a smoothie.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:28.959
Right?

00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:32.141
Smoothies keep the spookies away.

00:34:32.221 --> 00:34:32.761
Exactly.

00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:37.642
Oh, but that's really cool with the signs behind the crazy firelight colors there.

00:34:38.022 --> 00:34:39.042
Pretty cool.

00:34:39.342 --> 00:34:43.883
It's a bit shocking to like look at the night sky and see that, but... Silent Hill!

00:34:44.623 --> 00:34:45.063
Hi!

00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:46.584
I think it's good though, you know?

00:34:47.004 --> 00:34:50.744
All the cool stuff like the signs and the reasons behind it, so... Yeah.

00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:54.105
But, but, please be safe on your walks, okay?

00:34:54.145 --> 00:34:55.205
Be okay.

00:34:55.285 --> 00:34:56.045
Don't slip.

00:34:56.505 --> 00:34:57.906
It looks pretty dark in there, too.

00:34:57.966 --> 00:34:58.366
It's dark.

00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.903
Be safe, okay?

00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.245
BAU BAU!

00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:08.235
Question of the Day!

00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:10.917
We have... De-den!

00:35:11.858 --> 00:35:16.082
Some time ago you mentioned you wanted to help unite all hololive.

00:35:16.122 --> 00:35:19.965
Have you thought of doing some Japanese teaching streamings?

00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:26.571
That way English-speaking Ruffians will understand you and your senpais better, and it would be fun to learn from you.

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:27.472
What do you think?

00:35:27.912 --> 00:35:29.093
It's a good question.

00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:31.255
We'd really love to do more!

00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:31.876
We had our

00:35:32.216 --> 00:35:34.500
Japanese lesson with Advent, right?

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.390
We taught them some important Japanese words and phrases.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.596
It was a lot of fun, but also a lot of work, too.

00:35:45.865 --> 00:35:46.245
BAU BAU!

00:35:46.305 --> 00:35:46.505
BAU BAU!

00:36:04.472 --> 00:36:08.357
Our brains, they kind of felt like they were going to explode a bit last time.

00:36:08.377 --> 00:36:09.257
Just a bit!

00:36:09.298 --> 00:36:09.978
Just a bit!

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.502
But we really want to do more now!

00:36:13.562 --> 00:36:14.964
Yeah, it will be fun!

00:36:15.164 --> 00:36:18.768
But obviously, you know, our Japanese isn't perfect either, so... No, it won't be perfect.

00:36:19.128 --> 00:36:20.229
We do our best.

00:36:20.249 --> 00:36:22.312
We may be a bit of a silly sensei.

00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:25.074
We might make some mistakes, too.

00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:25.655
You think!

00:36:27.912 --> 00:36:31.835
Do you think we're just silly?

00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:35.898
Silly sensei.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.942
There's not many teachers that will teach you some kind of words.

00:36:42.943 --> 00:36:49.067
But we would like to be able to try teaching English to some of our JP senpais too!

00:36:49.368 --> 00:36:55.972
Ruffians, do you have any ideas for a senpai that you think would like an English lesson from FUWAMOCO?

00:37:00.372 --> 00:37:00.812
Biboo.

00:37:00.912 --> 00:37:02.013
Biboo knows English.

00:37:02.093 --> 00:37:04.355
I think maybe Biboo could teach us some English.

00:37:04.375 --> 00:37:04.955
Mikocchi-senpai.

00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:05.436
Poruru-oneechan.

00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:07.918
She doesn't seem very into it.

00:37:07.938 --> 00:37:08.018
Why?

00:37:14.673 --> 00:37:15.153
Pekora.

00:37:15.513 --> 00:37:17.014
Pekora-senpai.

00:37:17.074 --> 00:37:18.414
She's busy with her concert.

00:37:18.454 --> 00:37:20.875
She doesn't have time to learn English right now.

00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:23.036
Kaie-senpai.

00:37:23.056 --> 00:37:24.456
That would be cute.

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:29.218
We'll have to think about it.

00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:30.478
BAU BAU!

00:37:30.558 --> 00:37:32.739
Thank you for the question!

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:36.980
And thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.581
And we'll be counting on you as we ask

00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:40.061
BAU BAU!

00:37:40.121 --> 00:37:41.062

00:38:02.148 --> 00:38:02.568
De-den!

00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:24.442
I don't really know much about the game yet.

00:38:24.462 --> 00:38:26.362
But it seems like it's very addicting.

00:38:26.443 --> 00:38:31.204
Yeah, I'm just looking forward to seeing how much passion we'll get to, you know?

00:38:31.624 --> 00:38:33.365
We hope you'll join us, Ruffians!

00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:34.865
BAU BAU!

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:36.886
And our schedule!

00:38:37.386 --> 00:38:44.691
Wow, this week we have a lot of exciting things going on, but on Friday we have a collab together with all of Advent.

00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:50.914
We're playing Blade Up, but this time at the end we have a big announcement for you!

00:38:50.974 --> 00:38:56.118
We hope that you'll be there to hear it right from us, and that you'll look forward to it too.

00:38:57.178 --> 00:38:58.919
BAU BAU!

00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:00.500
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.723
Thank you so much for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:14.408
Wow, but before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:39:14.789 --> 00:39:15.609

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:17.190

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:48.323
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:39:48.363 --> 00:39:51.126
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:51.166 --> 00:39:51.646
BAU BAU!
