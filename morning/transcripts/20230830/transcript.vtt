00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:05.060
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:08.790
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:12.260
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.715
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.150
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.220
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.624
And together we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:32.704 --> 00:05:40.850
Thank you for joining us today for our 13th episode!

00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:48.336
For Ruffians that are maybe joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every

00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:50.517
Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:52.717
So FUWAMOCO, in case you didn't know.

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:53.678
That's right, it's FUWAMOCO.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.019
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:02.860
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.620
Ruffians!

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.481
Not the left paw.

00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:06.421
Not the left, the right paw.

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:12.723
Please remember to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:12.763 --> 00:06:15.164
It's up at the top right corner there.

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:22.649
Let's all do our best to BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.971
BAU BAU!

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:26.572
Ruffians!

00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:27.292
BAU BAU.

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:30.275
Moco-chan.

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:35.178
It seems like there's been another.

00:06:38.223 --> 00:06:40.104
Pero Sighting!

00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:42.985
I guess he stands out a bit, right?

00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:44.066
Maybe just a bit.

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:47.808
Ruffians, you do such a good job finding Pero.

00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:48.848
Where is he this time?

00:06:49.148 --> 00:06:50.989
Where is he this time?

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.451
Where is he in this room?

00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:56.392
What?

00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:57.612
Where?

00:06:58.653 --> 00:06:59.694
Where?

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:02.935
Pero's stuck in this dog's tummy?

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.516
What's going on here?

00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:06.517
Ruffians!

00:07:09.392 --> 00:07:11.574
Wait, how did he get in there?

00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:12.996
What are you doing, Pero?

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.681
Is this dog sick?

00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:22.874
Pero, Pero?

00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:24.314
Maybe sick.

00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:25.935
Maybe sick?

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:29.077
I hope this dog's okay.

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:33.699
I hope this isn't another symptom of BAU BAU-byo.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:34.800
What's up, Ruffians?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.520
You're next!

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.581
We are next!

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:41.504
I don't like the feeling I get from this photo.

00:07:41.964 --> 00:07:43.064
It's very unsettling.

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:43.685
Right?

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:46.426
Is the doggy going to rescue him?

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:47.687
Maybe?

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.869
What's gonna happen to the dog though?

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.516
Is this what happens in the back rooms?

00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:56.814
Maybe it's related?

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:58.434
Transportation.

00:07:58.714 --> 00:08:00.835
Ruffians, do you have any answers?

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:04.296
Maybe there's some doctors in the audience?

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:05.517
Doctors!

00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:07.898
Can you explain?

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:09.538
I obviously don't understand.

00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:10.759
I'm not seeing any good answers.

00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:11.199
No.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:12.239
Rebirth.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.680
That's not an answer.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.380
Rebirth.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.761
Pero is baby.

00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:18.141
Like this dog.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:19.222
Very rude, baby.

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:23.420
I don't think that's how it works, Ruffians.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.660
I don't think so.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:24.840
No.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.001
Hoping for the best.

00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:27.401
Yes!

00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:33.064
I feel like this is our most unsettling and intense Pero Sighting yet.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:34.405
What do you think?

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:37.844
I don't know.

00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:43.827
Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more sightings, okay?

00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:45.007
Or an explanation.

00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:46.508
Or an explanation, yeah.

00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:50.529
Remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:08:50.849 --> 00:08:52.790
That was disturbing.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.271
That was a disturbing way to start our morning.

00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:57.052
Just a bit!

00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:58.012
It's gone now!

00:08:58.152 --> 00:08:59.373
Let's all think about it.

00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:01.253
It's over.

00:09:01.273 --> 00:09:02.094
Okay.

00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:04.214
On to the Happy Puddin' FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:06.897
It's not the happy part.

00:09:07.457 --> 00:09:07.698
What?

00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:09.340
It's not the happy part.

00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:11.182
Not the happy part?

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:12.083
Ruffians.

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:14.646
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, always all happy part!

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:20.553
We have another... A misunderstanding, huh?

00:09:21.254 --> 00:09:21.555
Yeah.

00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:22.235
So!

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:27.680
I wanted to say, this misunderstanding was again.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.620
Again.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.761
During our chat with all of Abyss.

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:34.622
During the first day of the Splash Party Potsuwa.

00:09:36.382 --> 00:09:37.942
I was really confused, you know?

00:09:37.962 --> 00:09:41.103
Were you Ruffians?

00:09:42.343 --> 00:09:43.324
Were you confused?

00:09:43.344 --> 00:09:43.784
Do you know?

00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:45.384
Do you know what it is?

00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:46.885
Do you know what happened?

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:50.725
I'm not seeing it.

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:52.766
I'm not.

00:09:53.413 --> 00:09:55.454
So... Then it's important we talk about it today.

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:56.234
Yeah, yeah!

00:09:56.274 --> 00:09:57.135
Have to clear it, you know?

00:09:57.155 --> 00:09:57.515
Yeah.

00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:04.118
So Nuresai... She was talking about... What kind of... Of rice... That she likes.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:08.280
And, you know... She seemed really hungry, so... She was hungry.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.000
You know, I wanted to make her hungrier.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.261
Yeah.

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:12.942
And... I was playing with her like, Open up!

00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:14.122
I'm the mama bird!

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.143
Here comes the rice!

00:10:15.303 --> 00:10:16.303
It's piping hot!

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:22.046
And... And... You know... Then... Then she started...

00:10:23.743 --> 00:10:24.245
Morning.

00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:26.089
B-morning!

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.937
And I was really confused.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:31.740
Right.

00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.621
That would be cool.

00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:41.406
And you know, I even saw comments on videos of it saying things like, Mococo is doing this on purpose!

00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:45.109
And that I'm going to become like, some of our senpai.

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.429
Yeah.

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:52.513
I saw a comment that Moco-chan's like, Matsuri-senpai tweeting.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.075
She's gonna become Matsuri-senpai!

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.620
Ruffians!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.781
That's kind of rude to Matsuri-senpai, right?

00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:03.562
Matsuri-senpai is Matsuri-senpai.

00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:06.582
And she does what she does wonderfully, you know?

00:11:06.602 --> 00:11:09.923
Moco-chan, you can't become Matsuri-senpai.

00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:11.584
I don't know if I want that.

00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:13.584
Moco-chan, that's rude.

00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:17.305
I'm Mococo, okay?

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:18.385
She's Mococo.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.726
It both starts with an M, but it's totally different, okay?

00:11:23.907 --> 00:11:25.287
You know...

00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:28.318
All I know is that I was framed.

00:11:28.338 --> 00:11:32.623
I was just trying to be Mama Bird for Nurses Baby Bird.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:34.305
That was where you made the mistake.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.482
If you look, if you look, you can see my expression.

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:39.683
I'm very confused.

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:40.683
I'm very hurt.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:41.243
Okay.

00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:42.464
Go watch!

00:11:42.904 --> 00:11:43.585
You can see.

00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:44.845
There's footage.

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:48.908
There's evidence of me being very confused.

00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:50.749
You got hurt by her moans.

00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:51.509
Moco-chan.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:52.189
I was hurt.

00:11:52.309 --> 00:11:54.211
Yeah.

00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:54.611
Yeah.

00:11:54.951 --> 00:11:55.371
Okay.

00:11:56.192 --> 00:11:56.832
I was framed.

00:11:57.692 --> 00:11:58.973
Understood.

00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:00.674
Misunderstanding clear.

00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:02.135
You get it now.

00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:07.171
Good.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:08.192
Good.

00:12:09.692 --> 00:12:09.792
Yes!

00:12:09.852 --> 00:12:10.412
Innocent!

00:12:10.532 --> 00:12:11.392
Innocent!

00:12:11.512 --> 00:12:11.792
Okay!

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:13.233
Yeah, we're innocent puppies.

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:14.693
Always are forever.

00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:16.233
Got it.

00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:17.013
Yeah.

00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:18.354
Not really.

00:12:18.374 --> 00:12:19.954
That's your problem.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.574
It's clear now!

00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:24.875
BAU BAU!

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:29.076
So that means only happy things now, right?

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:29.536
Yeah.

00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:30.816
No more sad things.

00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:31.136
No.

00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:35.713
Now onto the happy part.

00:12:36.473 --> 00:12:39.374
I actually have something else I need to talk about.

00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:42.514
Something else?

00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:45.015
Maybe it's not happy.

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:45.555
What?!

00:12:46.135 --> 00:12:50.676
It's something really, really important, okay, Ruffians?

00:12:51.276 --> 00:12:52.997
And it's a bit embarrassing.

00:12:53.457 --> 00:12:56.417
A bit for me, but maybe more for someone else.

00:12:56.437 --> 00:12:57.958
For someone else?

00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:58.458
Nerissa!

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:06.462
You know, we uploaded our Holo Summer Shorts, right?

00:13:07.503 --> 00:13:07.843
Yeah.

00:13:08.984 --> 00:13:11.226
I have something important to share.

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:16.170
So... Holo Summer Shorts.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.091
This person's not gonna be very happy.

00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:21.645
What?

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:25.089
Fuwawa exposed me!

00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.529
What?

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.932
It's a picture of you, not me.

00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:30.834
Fuwawa doesn't know, but I caught her.

00:13:30.855 --> 00:13:32.356
What?

00:13:32.877 --> 00:13:36.640
She keeps on watching my shorts over and over and over.

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:42.706
You know, I'll call for her, and then I hear the splashing sounds from my video.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.725
And I keep on asking her why.

00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:48.087
And she says, oh, I just want to watch it.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.748
I just want to watch it, Mococo.

00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:53.911
And then she has a silly expression, a silly smile on her face.

00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:56.313
I just, I can't help it, Ruffians!

00:13:56.353 --> 00:13:58.375
You know, it's really cute!

00:13:58.395 --> 00:14:01.097
Ruffians, you feel the same way, right?

00:14:01.137 --> 00:14:02.998
It's making you feel the same way.

00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:07.122
You were watching lots and lots with a silly smile on your face, maybe, too.

00:14:07.182 --> 00:14:07.722
Right?

00:14:08.022 --> 00:14:08.423
Right?

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:11.379
Right!

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.441
You get it right!

00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:14.581
It's cute!

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.082
It just can't be helped!

00:14:18.203 --> 00:14:18.683
I don't know.

00:14:18.703 --> 00:14:21.985
I feel like, you know, it's a must watch.

00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:24.067
50 times kind of sweat.

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.267
One time, oh it's cute.

00:14:25.527 --> 00:14:26.128
Two times, oh it's cute!

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:26.988
You think it's that good?

00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:28.249
Three times, it's really cute!

00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:29.670
You think it's that good?

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.370
It's cute.

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:32.031
It's my sister.

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:38.314
You know, especially when Moco-chan laughs and then splashes.

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:42.295
And then, you know, she kind of gets a bit more of a ram.

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:43.776
Moco-chan, spicy!

00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:44.576
Spicy?

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:45.696
I'm never spicy.

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:47.937
Never spicy.

00:14:48.057 --> 00:14:48.738
Ruffians!

00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:52.019
Make sure, if you haven't checked it out yet, that you watch it, okay?

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:54.180
Maybe 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, 50 times!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.380
100 times!

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.580
500,000 times!

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.660
Yeah, make sure you watch FUWAMOCO too, okay?

00:15:02.284 --> 00:15:03.929
FUWAMOCO-chan, you should be proud!

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.433
You should be proud!

00:15:05.453 --> 00:15:06.396
Of what?

00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:08.737
Of your splashing.

00:15:09.357 --> 00:15:10.397
I did a good job splashing.

00:15:10.417 --> 00:15:11.218
You did, you did.

00:15:11.238 --> 00:15:15.479
You got us all thoroughly splashed.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.461
The next thing we wanted to talk about today.

00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:21.422
This!

00:15:21.762 --> 00:15:23.062
This, this, this!

00:15:23.363 --> 00:15:27.464
We've received a lot of questions from you Ruffians about our claws.

00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:28.945
Our magic claws.

00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:30.305
Very important.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.826
They're magic claws.

00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:33.807
Here's a bit more information about them.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.127
You might have seen it.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.088
Right, right!

00:15:37.148 --> 00:15:38.630
So, aren't they pretty?

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.691
Aren't they cool?

00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:43.476
Mine are very good too.

00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:46.660
I bet you wish you could have some too.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.782
Ruffians?

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:49.163
Yeah, Ruffians.

00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:50.065
You can't though.

00:15:51.627 --> 00:15:54.590
But, most importantly, they used...

00:15:55.832 --> 00:16:00.537
They're most necessary, you know, as part of our job as Demon Guard Dogs.

00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:07.424
But I feel like, at least, as far as protecting your smile goes, they don't really have that much of a use right now.

00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:09.446
But, you know, that's a good thing!

00:16:09.646 --> 00:16:11.668
Yeah, good thing, right?

00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:12.349
No violence.

00:16:12.669 --> 00:16:15.152
I think, you know, Ruffians, if you got a taste of them,

00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:18.473
Ah, your smile might be gone for good.

00:16:18.593 --> 00:16:19.553
A bit, a bit.

00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:20.713
Yeah.

00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:21.953
They might have a couple smiles.

00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:22.253
They hurt.

00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:23.294
They hurt, you know.

00:16:23.574 --> 00:16:24.594
Yeah, you might have a couple smiles.

00:16:24.654 --> 00:16:26.254
A couple smiles now, huh?

00:16:26.434 --> 00:16:26.774
Huh?

00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:29.455
But yeah, we don't really need them, you know.

00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:32.576
When we're taking it easy and relaxing with you.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:33.576
Yeah, but.

00:16:33.856 --> 00:16:34.136
Yeah.

00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:36.377
We can put them away, so.

00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:37.157
If we want to.

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:38.137
They're always there.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:40.419
Whenever we want them.

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:42.200
But we didn't always have them though.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.404
You know, only after we got to a certain level in our Demon Dog Training, that we got them.

00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:51.286
You know, it happened when we got our claws too.

00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:53.588
Important part of Guard Dog Training, you know?

00:16:53.608 --> 00:16:59.412
And the strength of our claws is directly linked to the gem on the end of the claws just here.

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:01.513
A gem, very important.

00:17:02.794 --> 00:17:14.716
Yeah, you know, uh... But... It's a bit annoying because Pero... Pero still likes to complain that we need to work harder to be able to get our claws much stronger.

00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:16.677
I think it's pretty good.

00:17:16.777 --> 00:17:18.657
I don't think we're weak at all, you know?

00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:22.578
I think the Ruffians would think that they're very, very sharp.

00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:23.618
Yeah, they're strong.

00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:24.518
They're strong for now.

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:29.219
We don't need them that much to be able to protect your smiles, so... Hopefully.

00:17:29.419 --> 00:17:31.820
Yeah, unless something really scary comes along.

00:17:33.933 --> 00:17:35.494
But that shouldn't happen, right?

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.095
That shouldn't happen, right?

00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:41.558
Ruffians, you're not gonna make us use the legacy, right?

00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:45.960
Yeah, I don't think you want that.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.001
I don't think you will last.

00:17:48.182 --> 00:17:50.283
So, make sure you praise!

00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:51.344
Praise Moco-chan!

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:53.085
Moco-chan, is that a threat?

00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:58.757
Right?

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:01.518
Right?

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:02.419
Yeah.

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:05.280
No, no Berserker BAU BAUbers.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.262
Yeah, I wouldn't recommend them for back itching either.

00:18:11.062 --> 00:18:11.782
No, no, no.

00:18:12.262 --> 00:18:16.744
For those times, a twin is helpful.

00:18:16.884 --> 00:18:18.505
Moco-chan's good at back itching.

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.626
This is regular.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:21.166
Regular.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.406
Regular quiz.

00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:22.566
Yeah.

00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:22.706
One!

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:31.983
Ah, well, we also, we thought it was important that we talk about this today.

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:33.804
But this might be a bit more important.

00:18:35.465 --> 00:18:40.990
You know, we've mentioned it a bunch, but, but, we really like pon-de-rings.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.131
In case you didn't know.

00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:44.553
Ruffians, you remember what they are, right?

00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:45.073
Right!

00:18:45.253 --> 00:18:45.534
Right?

00:18:46.154 --> 00:18:47.195
The pon-de-rings.

00:18:51.957 --> 00:18:52.638
Yes, yes!

00:18:52.718 --> 00:18:53.799
Pon-de-ring, yes!

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.120
Yeah, pon-de-ring.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.444
It's a donut that's like super mochi-mochi like and chewy!

00:19:00.624 --> 00:19:03.326
But honestly, it's much more than just that.

00:19:03.346 --> 00:19:04.307
It doesn't compare.

00:19:04.787 --> 00:19:06.109
Ruffies, do you like donuts?

00:19:07.249 --> 00:19:07.530
Do you?

00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:10.777
Because you don't have to like donuts.

00:19:11.157 --> 00:19:13.179
To be honest, we're kind of mixed on them.

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:21.969
Donuts are like... I guess they're yummy, but... Because of that, we kind of feel like it's unfair to call pon-de-rings donuts.

00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:23.010
It's better than that.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.672
Pon-de-ring is a pon-de-ring!

00:19:25.593 --> 00:19:26.694
They're in their own class.

00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:27.635
They're like bulls.

00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:29.858
That's good, but pon-de-rings are better.

00:19:29.938 --> 00:19:30.318
They're better.

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.040
I don't know!

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.762
They kind of look like a dog toilet.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:35.942
They're really chewy!

00:19:35.962 --> 00:19:36.943
You know?

00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:42.807
The reason why it looks chewy is because it's CHEWY!

00:19:42.987 --> 00:19:43.627
Yeah!

00:19:43.988 --> 00:19:45.188
And it's really soft, too.

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:46.809
There's different flavors!

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.032
Like strawberry, or chocolate, or matcha sauce.

00:19:50.052 --> 00:19:51.533
You don't have to have a chocolate one.

00:19:51.573 --> 00:19:52.113
Yeah, no.

00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.755
But our favorite is just plain.

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:57.196
You know, it's slightly sweet.

00:19:57.577 --> 00:19:58.697
Yeah, you can't beat it.

00:19:58.777 --> 00:19:59.458
It's just perfect.

00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:01.420
Perfectly sweet.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.901
Good balance.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:07.886
But because of that, you know, I feel like you never really get tired because of it.

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:08.627
Exactly!

00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:11.970
Perfectly sweet, so you could have something that's a bit more like bitter.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.031
Yeah, good balance.

00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:14.733
I wouldn't want to have soda with it.

00:20:15.493 --> 00:20:17.195
That would be disgusting.

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:20.657
Unless you're maybe like a very strong sweetness Ruffian.

00:20:21.318 --> 00:20:23.499
I think we're pretty strong, but I'm not that way.

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:25.241
Not that strong, no.

00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:29.384
Because you know they're just perfectly sweet, you could eat a bunch of them!

00:20:29.404 --> 00:20:30.505
A bunch of them!

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.746
I guess for better or worse.

00:20:33.907 --> 00:20:41.613
Ruffians, can you guess what a normal order of pawings would be for us while we are both doing guard dog training?

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:44.195
Huh?

00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:47.294
A hundred and one?

00:20:47.755 --> 00:20:47.995
No.

00:20:48.035 --> 00:20:50.779
That's a bit difficult.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:51.901
A dozen?

00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:53.764
Twenty each?

00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:54.965
Ten!

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.403
It's a pool box.

00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:04.844
A pool box!

00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:07.988
They give you a special box, like a pon-de-ring box?

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:10.992
I don't know, it looks kind of like a... I think it's a normal donut box.

00:21:11.012 --> 00:21:13.535
But if you only fill it up with pon-de-ring, then it's a pon-de-ring box.

00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:17.580
It looks special, like you know that you're transporting them across the country.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.981
Right!

00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:19.022
Very official.

00:21:21.284 --> 00:21:26.228
But we also make sure that we run a round of bites so they don't have a negative effect or anything.

00:21:26.288 --> 00:21:28.410
Yeah, you know when you're doing training, it's okay.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.672
But it's not like pon-de-rings would ever do anything horrible to you.

00:21:31.732 --> 00:21:33.353
No, they only are good stuff.

00:21:33.373 --> 00:21:35.935
They only bring smiles, you know?

00:21:36.376 --> 00:21:38.017
It's like a special smile soup, right?

00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:41.299
Right, when you look at them, they make you happy, they make you smile.

00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:45.983
And then when you eat them, you take a... You get even a bigger smile!

00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:48.692
Ah, yeah.

00:21:49.012 --> 00:21:52.474
You know, they have a lot of the different, like, the pawns, the pawns.

00:21:52.534 --> 00:21:53.095
How many pawns?

00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:53.635
Eight pawns?

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:55.435
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

00:21:55.536 --> 00:21:57.478
I'm memorizing.

00:21:57.738 --> 00:21:58.318
Eight pawns.

00:21:58.458 --> 00:22:00.059
If it doesn't have eight, it's not right.

00:22:00.099 --> 00:22:01.220
Yeah, it needs to be the eight.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:01.960
Eight pawns.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.361
Yeah.

00:22:02.461 --> 00:22:03.601
So you can eat them slowly.

00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:04.302
And share!

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:05.462
Right, that too.

00:22:05.502 --> 00:22:08.344
Because you know, you can divide eight by two.

00:22:08.364 --> 00:22:10.746
I can too, but we don't do that.

00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:12.387
But it's possible.

00:22:12.407 --> 00:22:14.568
If you need it to be there, you can.

00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:17.830
And you can share it equally because you know there's eight.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:18.850
There's eight.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.593
Yeah, and then the other good thing about Pon-de-rings is that there's a king!

00:22:23.613 --> 00:22:25.094
A king of Pon-de-rings.

00:22:25.534 --> 00:22:26.454
He's very cute.

00:22:27.075 --> 00:22:29.776
I want to know actually, Ruffians, do you know his name?

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:31.037
The king.

00:22:31.197 --> 00:22:33.838
I think we talked about him too earlier.

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:37.240
Maybe that was during our Japanese Latsudance too?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:37.721
Maybe.

00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:38.481
Maybe.

00:22:40.032 --> 00:22:40.633
Pondelion!

00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:43.295
He's the king!

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:48.300
He's the king of the Pon-de-rings, the Pondelion.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.564
You know there's a bunch of mascots, but he's the best.

00:22:51.624 --> 00:22:52.725
Pondelion's the best.

00:22:53.085 --> 00:22:55.548
What were the other ones?

00:22:55.928 --> 00:22:57.029
Honeycooler.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.591
Honeywooler!

00:22:58.631 --> 00:22:59.231
Honeywooler!

00:22:59.271 --> 00:23:00.793
Honeywooler!

00:23:01.794 --> 00:23:03.536
I can't remember the other one.

00:23:05.312 --> 00:23:11.784
But you know, I feel like it would be nice if we could be like the twin demon dogs upon the rings.

00:23:12.585 --> 00:23:14.649
You know he's the king, we're the twin demon dogs.

00:23:16.184 --> 00:23:18.346
I feel like we work well together, you know?

00:23:18.386 --> 00:23:21.469
We bring smiles, we protect them, right?

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:22.990
It's a perfect balance!

00:23:23.991 --> 00:23:28.274
So Ruffians, if you see Ponda Rings around, please have at least one.

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:29.696
Yeah, think about us, okay?

00:23:29.716 --> 00:23:30.697
When you eat them, right?

00:23:30.737 --> 00:23:34.340
But remember, you can tell a true Ponda Ring by how many of the ponds it has.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.000
Eight.

00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:36.381
Eight.

00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:36.922
Important.

00:23:37.262 --> 00:23:37.662
Okay?

00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:39.424
BAU BAU!

00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:40.585
Ponda BAU!

00:23:40.605 --> 00:23:41.145
Ponda BAU!

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:41.646
Ponda BAU.

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:44.376
This is so good.

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:46.257
I can taste it right now.

00:23:46.277 --> 00:23:49.940
It's good.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.341
Almost as delicious as cats.

00:23:52.742 --> 00:23:52.982
And next!

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.013
FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

00:24:01.073 --> 00:24:02.013
Ruffians!

00:24:02.234 --> 00:24:07.538
As you might know, we're looking for a jingle from you for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:24:07.558 --> 00:24:12.002
We wanted to say again thank you for so many wonderful submissions.

00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:14.484
We've been listening to a bunch of them.

00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:17.706
They're all so so so unique.

00:24:18.927 --> 00:24:26.052
But we can only decide on one jingle, so... I think we'd like to showcase a bunch of them too, you know?

00:24:26.072 --> 00:24:29.854
They're all so great, so I feel really mixed.

00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:30.535
Yeah.

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.696
Does that sound fun, Ruffians?

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:33.897
Showcase?

00:24:34.077 --> 00:24:35.117
Showcase some of them too!

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.055
Is that good?

00:24:37.655 --> 00:24:37.975
Yes!

00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:38.456
Yes!

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:40.077
Okay!

00:24:40.237 --> 00:24:41.478
Good, good, good, good.

00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:49.384
But we also wanted to mention for creators, again, we're planning to use the jingle at the very beginning of each episode.

00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:58.492
So, you know, once we transition to the studio and we play just right before we go, holo holo BAU BAU!

00:24:58.532 --> 00:24:59.332
You know?

00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:00.533
Just right there.

00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:00.874
Yeah.

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:06.871
And also a reminder, the third line is quickly approaching.

00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:09.152
It's on September 3rd.

00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:12.273
So don't forget, okay?

00:25:12.573 --> 00:25:13.214
Be careful.

00:25:13.634 --> 00:25:15.775
It's almost September.

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:19.096
Almost.

00:25:19.256 --> 00:25:24.498
Let's all bring close to August together and make September the best month we can.

00:25:25.538 --> 00:25:25.839
Ever!

00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:26.559
The best month ever.

00:25:30.322 --> 00:25:36.746
Well, I think it's time for our Regular Corner's Doggie of the Day!

00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:37.527
BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:39.688
Who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:40.849
We'll see.

00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:41.570
De-den!

00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:45.552
It's Coco!

00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:46.293
Not Mococo.

00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:47.553
Coco!

00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:48.854
I'm not Doggie of the Day.

00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:49.994
You're not Doggie of the Day.

00:25:50.014 --> 00:25:51.335
You're never Doggie of the Day.

00:25:51.595 --> 00:25:53.455
I'm always Doggie of the Day.

00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:53.535
Huh?

00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:54.216
No!

00:25:54.576 --> 00:25:56.276
Coco is Doggie of the Day today.

00:25:57.117 --> 00:26:03.179
Coco is very sleepy after being woken up early in the morning doing Splash Party Day 2.

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:04.319
I see.

00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:05.839
Get a good rest, Coco!

00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:05.999
Yeah!

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.160
Whatever, Mococo.

00:26:09.278 --> 00:26:10.279
Well, I don't know.

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:14.221
Moco-chan, maybe you feel similar to Coco.

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:15.362
You sympathize a bit.

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:16.843
Yeah, I feel like this.

00:26:17.283 --> 00:26:19.385
I feel like this right... Not right now.

00:26:20.926 --> 00:26:22.547
Not right now, but recently.

00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:24.628
Maybe on Splash Party Day too.

00:26:24.888 --> 00:26:25.569
Maybe a bit.

00:26:25.809 --> 00:26:28.251
Same expression.

00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:34.055
It's good, you know, that this Ruffian snapped a photo of Coco's sleeping face and not Mococo's.

00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:38.918
I don't think Moco-chan would be nearly as cute.

00:26:39.738 --> 00:26:41.359
I would be a bit more angry looking.

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.280
That's for sure.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.661
Maybe some drool.

00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:47.802
Your tail would be all fuzzy.

00:26:48.622 --> 00:26:49.163
You know?

00:26:49.763 --> 00:26:50.083
Right?

00:26:50.323 --> 00:26:51.244
Is that a problem?

00:26:51.504 --> 00:26:52.344
That's a problem.

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:53.825
Ruffians don't want to see that.

00:26:56.836 --> 00:26:58.537
What's that angry face for?

00:26:58.617 --> 00:26:59.538
See, that's even better!

00:27:00.438 --> 00:27:01.159
I told you so.

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.221
Coco's sleeping face is the cutest.

00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:08.103
Not to be confused with Moco-chan.

00:27:08.484 --> 00:27:10.345
How does Coco BAU BAU?

00:27:10.565 --> 00:27:14.888
You know, like maybe a half asleep BAU BAU, or like sleeping BAU BAU.

00:27:14.908 --> 00:27:16.609
Oh boy.

00:27:16.709 --> 00:27:17.109
Oh boy.

00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:19.983
BAU BAU.

00:27:20.623 --> 00:27:21.324
BAU BAU.

00:27:21.404 --> 00:27:22.244
I just woke up.

00:27:22.445 --> 00:27:24.506
You woke me up because of the splash party.

00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:25.407
BAU BAU.

00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:26.448
BAU BAU.

00:27:26.788 --> 00:27:28.009
My English is BAU BAU!

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.470
A bit rough.

00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:31.731
A bit rough, yeah.

00:27:32.552 --> 00:27:33.713
Well, I think you know.

00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:43.626
Coco, you know, even though you woke up Coco while having too much fun during the splash party, I think, you know, you don't really mind.

00:27:43.726 --> 00:27:46.928
Go on a nice early walk together, you know?

00:27:46.968 --> 00:27:49.149
She's just glad that you're having fun.

00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:50.470
That's the most important thing.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:56.293
But you know, there's probably the expectation that you're going to take her out bright and early for a walk though, you know?

00:27:56.313 --> 00:28:00.156
That's your duty as her loyal and loving family, right?

00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:02.262
Walks.

00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:02.962
Walks.

00:28:03.263 --> 00:28:04.744
No leash!

00:28:05.064 --> 00:28:06.645
Leash is probably a good idea, Moco-chan.

00:28:06.686 --> 00:28:08.167
For you, no leash.

00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:10.969
But for Coco, a leash probably sounds very good.

00:28:13.612 --> 00:28:16.034
BAU BAU!

00:28:16.935 --> 00:28:20.598
But today I went on a walk.

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:23.260
We have... De-den!

00:28:26.589 --> 00:28:29.214
Such a nice walk on a foresty trail.

00:28:29.254 --> 00:28:30.737
And together with your dad!

00:28:33.543 --> 00:28:33.943
So nice.

00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:35.244
Right?

00:28:35.504 --> 00:28:36.445
Good memories.

00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:39.066
Nice time spent together.

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:42.468
You know, we're glad you could spend that time together.

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:49.672
And, you know, I feel like maybe that might not say it, but with you, it made me really happy, too.

00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:50.773
Yeah.

00:28:51.874 --> 00:28:55.616
And you had your first Ice Pumpkin Spice Latte of the Year, too.

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:55.996
Special.

00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:57.577
Extra special.

00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:02.579
Do you like it better iced?

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.842
Ruffians, yum!

00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:05.687
Because you can get it hot or cold.

00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.953
I feel like it looks pretty cold in the photo.

00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:16.796
But I guess if you're doing a forest trail, then it might get a bit hot, right?

00:29:16.816 --> 00:29:20.199
The heart's pumping together with that.

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:22.781
Do you think we should try it?

00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:24.802
The ice pumpkin spice latte?

00:29:24.842 --> 00:29:25.743
Hot is better.

00:29:26.644 --> 00:29:27.044
Ice.

00:29:27.484 --> 00:29:28.085
Blended!

00:29:28.205 --> 00:29:30.086
Like hot and cold together.

00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.347
How does that work?

00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:32.168
Hot!

00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:34.750
Even in hot weather!

00:29:37.132 --> 00:29:39.635
Extra, extra, extra birds.

00:29:40.656 --> 00:29:42.879
And you saw some silly birds too.

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:46.563
I don't know how to pronounce those birds, but they sound pretty silly.

00:29:48.285 --> 00:29:52.429
But I guess you know, before we know it, it's gonna be spooky season again.

00:29:54.747 --> 00:29:55.928
No spooky.

00:29:56.429 --> 00:30:01.154
Let's make sure to go on lots of walks before it gets kind of gross and weird out there.

00:30:01.554 --> 00:30:01.775
Okay.

00:30:01.895 --> 00:30:02.676
No wet dogs.

00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:03.777
No wet dogs.

00:30:03.837 --> 00:30:04.217
Not yet.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.580
Thank you!

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.181
BAU BAU!

00:30:08.301 --> 00:30:09.381
BAU BAU!

00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:13.724
And today for our Question of the Day!

00:30:13.804 --> 00:30:14.625
What do we have?

00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:15.945
Ta-da!

00:30:17.366 --> 00:30:23.390
Does Mococo notice that she adds an A at the end of all her O and U ending words?

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.930
BAUI?

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.730
NOI?

00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:26.011
YUI?

00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:27.552
Do you do that?

00:30:27.612 --> 00:30:29.013
When did this start?

00:30:29.493 --> 00:30:32.515
How come Fuwawa doesn't do this if you're twins?

00:30:33.175 --> 00:30:33.976
Hey!

00:30:34.336 --> 00:30:35.477
Do I even do this?

00:30:37.047 --> 00:30:37.907
I don't think I do.

00:30:37.927 --> 00:30:39.308
Does Moco-chan do this?

00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:40.128
I do not know this.

00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:43.329
My BAU is totally normal, okay?

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.730
No, you're just trying to make me self-conscious of it, huh?

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.110
Right.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:53.732
Just because we're not exactly the same on everything doesn't mean that we're less twins, you know?

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:56.173
You're not misunderstanding.

00:30:56.213 --> 00:30:58.873
We don't have to go over this in the misunderstanding corner, do we?

00:30:59.274 --> 00:30:59.954
That's a threat.

00:31:03.256 --> 00:31:05.658
You know, I see comments being like, oi!

00:31:05.938 --> 00:31:07.419
They are identical twins.

00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:09.360
Just use your eyes, you know?

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:13.624
Fuwawa has bigger ears and different eye color.

00:31:13.864 --> 00:31:16.766
They can't be identical.

00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:17.687
What do you mean?

00:31:18.607 --> 00:31:21.750
Are you calling our Maba Puppy a liar then?

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.412
On something so important?

00:31:25.072 --> 00:31:25.532
Hai!

00:31:25.993 --> 00:31:26.233
Hai!

00:31:26.893 --> 00:31:30.016
This is one of my favorite things I'm watching, you see.

00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:34.995
Thank you!

00:31:36.336 --> 00:31:37.277
Thank you!

00:31:37.357 --> 00:31:38.157
I'm happy!

00:31:38.598 --> 00:31:39.278
You're happy?

00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:40.259
Good Ruffians.

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:40.779
So nice.

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:41.440
Yeah!

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.901
Thank you!

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:46.964
BAU BAU!

00:31:47.004 --> 00:31:48.625
Thank you!

00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:51.807
Moco-chan, you do something like that, huh?

00:31:52.087 --> 00:31:52.408
Huh?

00:31:53.148 --> 00:31:53.568
Okay, well.

00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:54.029
BAU BAU!

00:31:54.069 --> 00:31:54.909
BAU BAU!

00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:03.562
Moco-chan, you feel pretty, uh, fired up today?

00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:04.803
Am I?

00:32:05.203 --> 00:32:05.403
Maybe?

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:10.024
It seems like you are pretty, uh... Well, Ruffians, don't forget!

00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:15.446
We're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day.

00:32:15.686 --> 00:32:18.107
We want to hear more about your rocks and of course, questions!

00:32:18.527 --> 00:32:18.987
Questions!

00:32:19.167 --> 00:32:20.148
Ask me questions!

00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:21.488
Rocks, not your rocks.

00:32:21.728 --> 00:32:22.588
No, no pebbles.

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:27.190
Send your Pebbles to Biboo, okay?

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.891
That's the Biboo.

00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:29.911
That's the hashtag Pebble.

00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:33.312
We're hashtag FWMCMorning.

00:32:33.412 --> 00:32:35.113
It's a bit different.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.894
BAU BAU!

00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:40.435
We'll be waiting for your submissions!

00:32:40.515 --> 00:32:44.996
I've talked about a couple important things today, but I have something else.

00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:48.178
Something really important I want to tell you, okay?

00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:56.232
So, this.

00:32:57.533 --> 00:33:01.235
This here is a Mococo pep talk, okay?

00:33:01.795 --> 00:33:04.317
You're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:33:05.557 --> 00:33:07.018
Now, you!

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:08.599
Ruffians!

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:11.461
You've made it to the middle of the week!

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.342
Congratulations!

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:15.111
Ruffians!

00:33:15.672 --> 00:33:17.194
You're doing amazing.

00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:18.436
You're doing it!

00:33:19.538 --> 00:33:21.903
And you need to give yourself credit for that, okay?

00:33:22.564 --> 00:33:27.052
You know, you woke up today to watch FUWAMOCO Morning and you know what?

00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:31.902
After this, you're gonna make today amazing!

00:33:32.883 --> 00:33:33.723
I know you can do it.

00:33:34.543 --> 00:33:37.444
We all have days where we feel, you know, a bit off.

00:33:37.864 --> 00:33:42.926
But we just need to remind ourselves to take things in stride and keep on at it, okay?

00:33:43.666 --> 00:33:46.307
It's gonna be okay, because I believe in you.

00:33:49.008 --> 00:33:49.828
You can do it!

00:33:50.008 --> 00:33:50.928
I know you can!

00:33:51.388 --> 00:33:53.689
Ganbatte-nya!

00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:55.230
You awake now?

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.430
Huh?

00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:04.847
That was amazing, Moco-chan!

00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:06.948
BAU BAU!

00:34:07.648 --> 00:34:09.109
BAU BAU!

00:34:09.129 --> 00:34:09.849
Awake now!

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:13.131
You can do it, Ruffians!

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.531
You can do it!

00:34:14.591 --> 00:34:15.312
Our next stream!

00:34:15.372 --> 00:34:16.612
Our next stream!

00:34:16.632 --> 00:34:19.494
We have an Extra Special.

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:25.856
It's our one month celebration with you!

00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:29.138
I can't believe it's already been a month since we debuted.

00:34:29.498 --> 00:34:31.139
Ruffians, does it feel like that?

00:34:31.759 --> 00:34:33.040
It doesn't feel like that.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.581
Where did time go?

00:34:35.601 --> 00:34:36.821
We blinked and now we're here.

00:34:36.901 --> 00:34:37.301
It's here. 101.

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:46.925
But we actually have something very important that we'd like to share with you tonight.

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:49.186
We really hope you'll join us, okay? 101!

00:34:51.912 --> 00:34:55.533
I know, you know, it's maybe a bit rough, maybe.

00:34:55.673 --> 00:34:56.974
Ruffians are like, ah, it's rough.

00:34:57.294 --> 00:34:59.674
Because we did so many celebrations recently.

00:34:59.694 --> 00:35:01.975
I have to spend too much time with FUWAMOCO.

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:07.697
But you know, for us, one month really means a lot to us.

00:35:07.877 --> 00:35:08.257
It does.

00:35:08.957 --> 00:35:11.098
We really hope that you'll be there.

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:14.819
We're really excited to share what we have to share with you today!

00:35:15.219 --> 00:35:20.901
And, you know, we're gonna talk about a bunch of our feelings, you know, from before we debuted, since then.

00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:26.503
You know, we'll review some of our favorite moments from the past month and maybe talk about a future too!

00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:30.816
We hope that we'll see you there!

00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:32.757
BAU BAU!

00:35:33.617 --> 00:35:37.919
And for what else is coming up, we have our schedule!

00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:44.761
This upcoming weekend we're gonna be playing It Takes Two for the first time!

00:35:44.781 --> 00:35:46.562
We did take a bit of a peek at it.

00:35:48.323 --> 00:35:51.365
It seems like it's gonna be pretty chaotic.

00:35:52.346 --> 00:35:53.507
I guess that makes sense.

00:35:53.707 --> 00:35:55.548
If it takes two of us, it's sort of chaotic.

00:35:55.689 --> 00:35:58.371
We can be pretty mischievous sometimes too.

00:36:00.713 --> 00:36:03.836
I think Ruffians know that the best.

00:36:05.277 --> 00:36:09.580
It's gonna be interesting.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.424
On Sunday, we'll also be doing a very long super chat.

00:36:14.724 --> 00:36:19.908
It started early so that it can end late.

00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:22.971
It's gonna take however long it takes.

00:36:23.211 --> 00:36:24.272
We're gonna get it done.

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:32.974
We're really really thankful and want to make sure that we can properly express our feelings to you and say thank you for all your support.

00:36:34.983 --> 00:36:35.944
It means a lot to us.

00:36:36.004 --> 00:36:36.884
It's been a long time.

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:38.685
You've been waiting a long time.

00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:43.308
So, you know, let's have a lot of fun chit-chatting, being silly.

00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:47.811
Oh well, you know, we're finally able to properly say thank you.

00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:50.193
We hope you'll join us!

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:55.196
I'm not sure how long it's gonna be, but you know, one stream, the maximum is 12 hours.

00:36:57.482 --> 00:36:59.103
We'll see!

00:36:59.123 --> 00:37:02.766
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:37:02.806 --> 00:37:05.628
Thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:12.474
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!
