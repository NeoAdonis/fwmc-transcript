00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.431
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.953

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.304
Thank you for joining us today, Ruffians.

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:43.208
It's the end of the week, but it's also the 116th episode!

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:44.249
Not the 115th, no.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.260
Earlier.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.181
Funtime.

00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:58.622
Oh my son, it's the 116th episode!

00:05:58.802 --> 00:05:59.342
Right!

00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:02.583

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:07.245
Bye!

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:13.820
Maybe some Ruffians, maybe it's been a little while since your last FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.702
Yeah, it needed a bit of a refresher.

00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:23.669
Wow, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:24.309
A.K.A.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:25.510
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.192
And it's hosted by us.

00:06:27.852 --> 00:06:29.212
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:35.594
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:41.855

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:49.096
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.116 --> 00:06:53.377
Are you having a good morning so far, Ruffians?

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:55.678
Pressing the hashtag, hashtag button?

00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:56.338
Hashtag.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:56.918
Hashtag.

00:06:57.878 --> 00:06:58.439
Hashtag.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:59.059
Hi.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.720
Ya.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.164
What if you wanna start your day off on the left paw?

00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:04.625
No!

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.667
Oh, my answer is different.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.351
If you wanna start your day off on the left paw, go!

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:13.513
Go for it!

00:07:14.854 --> 00:07:17.156
If that will make you smile the most.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.099
You need to start on the right paw, okay?

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:21.080
Not the left one.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:23.483
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:25.004
Only the right paw.

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:26.344
You go for it, Ruffians.

00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:30.366
The left paw is some... You know sometimes it's good to kinda change things up, you know?

00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:32.127
Ah, not get unbalanced.

00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:33.307
Right, you know.

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:34.068
Left paw!

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:34.588
No.

00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:35.883
Right paw.

00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:36.583
Yes.

00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:37.904
Left paw.

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:38.564
Ah!

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:41.647
Then, Fuwawa's left paw, Moco-chan's right paw.

00:07:41.707 --> 00:07:42.347
Yeah!

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:43.087
BAU BAU!

00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:44.689
BAU BAU!

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:44.869
I'm done!

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:45.929
That means both paws equal.

00:07:56.627 --> 00:07:58.128
A big weekend's coming up!

00:07:58.148 --> 00:07:58.748
Yeah!

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:00.570
But we have bad news!

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.150
What?

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.371
Nothing's been cancelled, why?

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:06.109
No?

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.390
What is that?

00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.932
Apparently... What?

00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:13.693
There's been a Pero Sighting.

00:08:13.873 --> 00:08:14.894
A Pero Sighting!

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:18.095
That's what we have here!

00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:19.896
Where's the picture?

00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:21.537
Let's see where he is then.

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:25.379
De-den!

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.800
Nothing's there.

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:29.308
Huh?

00:08:29.948 --> 00:08:30.889
Still no Pero?

00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:31.249
Huh?

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:32.529
Ruffians!

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:35.931
We heard he had a birthday party.

00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:37.091
Right.

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:37.631
Huh?

00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:39.712
Where is he?

00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:40.512
Huh?

00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:43.453
Why didn't you take a photo of the birthday boy, huh?

00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:45.214
Huh?

00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:50.916
Well, uh, maybe he like escaped before the Ruffians could get a photo.

00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:53.057
Maybe he's off somewhere again.

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:55.638
I don't know.

00:08:55.718 --> 00:08:57.159
He was supposed to be back.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.460
Are you sure about that?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.782
Maybe he's preparing for something important.

00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:02.522
Huh?

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:04.863
The Pero have important things to do.

00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:07.145
I don't know.

00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:08.765
He's doing research.

00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:12.748
You can ask him what kind of research.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:16.690
Well...

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:18.336
We'll have to see.

00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:19.817
BAU BAU.

00:09:19.897 --> 00:09:21.019
BAU BAU!

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:23.081
Next time make sure you take a picture, okay?

00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:25.043
Picture says if that one works or not.

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:25.904
Then we know!

00:09:26.344 --> 00:09:27.446
Exactly where he is.

00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:31.330
And... Fuwamoco doesn't need to worry about it.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.810
Yeah!

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:32.952
BAU BAU!

00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:34.073
BAU BAU!

00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:35.534
Well, we'll see!

00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:36.035
Good news!

00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:36.996
Good news!

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:38.817
The season.

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:40.238
It's summer!

00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:41.118
It's summer!

00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:42.799
Finally summer!

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:43.719
And you know what?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.742
We're spending it together with you, our teacher, having fun on a summer camp too!

00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:51.622
BAU BAU!

00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:52.363
BAU BAU!

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:54.264
Oh no!

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.045
Voice pack!

00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:56.567
Academy voice pack!

00:09:57.467 --> 00:10:00.430
The Academy voice pack series is back!

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:01.091
It's back!

00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.753
FUWAMOCO it is!

00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:04.535
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:09.640
They're in our bathing suits together with Noel-senpai and Kanata-senpai!

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.020
Yeah!

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.921
The key visual!

00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:11.322
Right!

00:10:11.842 --> 00:10:13.344
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:17.408
You know, it was just released out early in the morning, Ruffians.

00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:18.029
Really?

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:20.672
But how many of you got your paws on it yet?

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:21.513
Cute!

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:24.596
You saw it, you saw it!

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:30.022
Moco-chan, you're having trouble with a little crab on your head there.

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:31.824
I was feeling a bit crabby, huh?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.062
Oh, there's a lot in them!

00:10:35.182 --> 00:10:36.223
You just got it!

00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:37.685
Oh, really!

00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:39.186
Oh, what did you think, Ruffians?

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:41.388
Oh, you might take it out!

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:44.411
Yeah, we got Fluffy the Fuzzy!

00:10:45.893 --> 00:10:47.675
Silver hair, silver hair.

00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:50.990
But yeah!

00:10:52.932 --> 00:10:53.632
I know!

00:10:53.772 --> 00:11:02.898
This time if you want you can check out my introduction video and then kind of see what kind of things happen on a summer trip.

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:10.544
So maybe spicy situations like feeding flowers on shaved ice and uh...

00:11:11.993 --> 00:11:13.736
Putting sunscreen on me.

00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:15.419
Is sunscreen spicy?

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:17.142
Is shaved ice spicy?

00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:19.366
Shaved ice is sweet, Moco-chan.

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:22.912
In what situation is shaved ice spicy?

00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:25.523
Well, Ruffians!

00:11:25.863 --> 00:11:33.665
If you wanna get an even better listen, you can go to the official hololive shop and listen to some sample voices there!

00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:35.786
And then you'll know exactly- Oh!

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:37.546
This is where the voice pack is!

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:37.886
Right?

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.006
You might be curious, huh?

00:11:39.026 --> 00:11:40.507
We also recorded that, huh?

00:11:40.527 --> 00:11:43.748
We recorded it in English and Japanese, so you can- Oh!

00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:45.768
What's the difference between them?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:49.869
You can also have a listen to some of our Senpai's voice packs too!

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:51.489
And their special voices too!

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.333
But we always put lots of love and effort into our voice packs, so please go ahead and take them out, okay?

00:12:00.513 --> 00:12:02.994
We wanna hear what you thought, okay, Ruffians?

00:12:03.114 --> 00:12:04.995
Yeah, you know the academy.

00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:07.737
The academy series has been going for a little while now.

00:12:07.757 --> 00:12:09.618
A little bit now, but you can jump in now.

00:12:09.858 --> 00:12:10.958
Yeah, I know.

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.720
But I hear there's some mysterious exchange soon.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.441
It's too hot.

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.102
So you can always jump in, okay?

00:12:17.122 --> 00:12:17.982
BAU BAU!

00:12:18.222 --> 00:12:19.123
BAU BAU!

00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:22.924
Wow!

00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:24.485
The summer continues.

00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:36.550
And this summer, in only just a few weeks from now, hololive English, we're holding our second concert, Breaking Dimensions, in New York City!

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.811
Yeah!

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:38.951
BAU BAU!

00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:40.372
What's this?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:41.052
What's this?

00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:42.273
FUWAMOCO after...

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.582
Making our brand new 3D debut this weekend!

00:12:46.602 --> 00:12:47.402
This weekend!

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:52.345
Of course, we'll be performing there with all of Advent as well!

00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:52.445
Yeah!

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:54.647
Yeah, let's go!

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:56.848
Bum bum bum bum!

00:12:56.888 --> 00:13:00.390
There's a lot of excitement going on, I think, Ruffians.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:10.416
But to get you pumped up even more, there's going to be an official program for the concert on the hololive English channel on YouTube here!

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.636
The official one.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:12.457
The official one.

00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:18.324
Not the official one.

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:21.688
You know, maybe there's some new extra information.

00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:24.371
Oh yeah, we haven't heard much for a little while.

00:13:24.391 --> 00:13:24.952
Right?

00:13:25.353 --> 00:13:28.196
You know, Ruffians got their tickets.

00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:29.518
Maybe for your streaming.

00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:35.284
But it's right before our 3D debut, so it's gonna be a very exciting day, okay?

00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:40.310
Yeah, it's happening right before our 3D debut.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:47.198
But Moco-chan, we actually got something a little bit special that we can share with the Ruffians.

00:13:49.472 --> 00:13:51.575
Well, take a look at this!

00:13:54.498 --> 00:14:00.104
It's me, Fuwawa!

00:14:00.584 --> 00:14:05.470
You look so fluffy and ready to break the dimensions!

00:14:06.223 --> 00:14:11.868
Yeah, maybe you'll just have to wait a little bit longer to see exactly how fluffy!

00:14:12.469 --> 00:14:12.989
Yeah!

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.651
And... Me!

00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:18.214
Moco-chan!

00:14:18.234 --> 00:14:19.094
Moco-chan!

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:19.595
Yeah!

00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:21.196
Pretty fluffy tail there.

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:22.217
Right!

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:23.018
Yeah!

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:24.179
Like a big puff.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:25.160
Right!

00:14:29.727 --> 00:14:31.749
I look forward to seeing it!

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.310
Maybe soon.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.231
Maybe.

00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:40.116
You'll have to tune into the program to catch all the latest news on Breaking Dimensions!

00:14:40.197 --> 00:14:41.017
Yay!

00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:43.499
Maybe there'll be some surprises too.

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:48.584
And then, after that, a 3D debut!

00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:51.667
BAU BAU BAU!

00:14:52.127 --> 00:14:53.548
But, what did you say?

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:54.910
A fuzzy tail?

00:14:56.447 --> 00:14:57.349
I'm the fluffy one.

00:14:57.589 --> 00:14:58.751
Did you say fluffy, Taylor?

00:14:58.771 --> 00:14:59.712
No, I said fuzzy.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.598
Are you sure about that?

00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:04.960
I'm the fluffy one.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.002
She said fluffy.

00:15:11.332 --> 00:15:14.314
I'm the fluffy one, I'm Fuwawa!

00:15:14.855 --> 00:15:15.896
BAU BAU!

00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:17.157
BAU BAU BAU!

00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:19.738
Speaking of 3D debuts!

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:20.499
Yes!

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:28.505
Someone who's not fluffy, someone who's not fuzzy, will be making their 3D debut today!

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:29.386
Yes!

00:15:29.766 --> 00:15:31.988
And that one is Nerissa!

00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:34.309
Nerissa, we be good!

00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:36.191
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:15:37.852 --> 00:15:44.014
Yeah, she's gonna be taking to the stage just after she released her brand new EP.

00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:44.774
Right.

00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:49.356
But she'll be making her debut at 8pm PT.

00:15:49.676 --> 00:15:50.917
So maybe Ruffians.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:56.844
Maybe you can get ready, get some coffee, maybe grab, gather some popcorn!

00:15:56.864 --> 00:15:57.064
Yeah!

00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:58.505
Or some meat!

00:15:58.725 --> 00:15:59.145
Meat!

00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:00.826
Nerissa always wants some meat!

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:01.946
What do you want to eat, Nerissa?

00:16:01.986 --> 00:16:02.306
Meat?

00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:04.387
No carbonated soda?

00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:04.767
No.

00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:05.367
No.

00:16:06.068 --> 00:16:11.610
Once you have that all, you can get ready for Nerissa's beautiful boys!

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.150
Yeah!

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.791
Are you excited, Ruffians?

00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:14.191
Yeah!

00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:14.731
Yeah!

00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:16.012
Somehow!

00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:16.692
Bye bye!

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.834
We're looking forward to it!

00:16:21.874 --> 00:16:23.654
I wonder what Nerissa's gonna do.

00:16:23.694 --> 00:16:27.155
We'll have to see very soon.

00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:28.096
Only 12 hours!

00:16:28.876 --> 00:16:31.157
You have a bit of time to make some popcorn.

00:16:32.017 --> 00:16:34.518
If you properly manage your time, you can do it.

00:16:34.538 --> 00:16:38.259
12 hours is quite a bit of time to make some popcorn.

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:39.199
Maybe.

00:16:39.219 --> 00:16:40.380
BAU BAU!

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.580
But, tomorrow...

00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:46.037
Tomorrow.

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.118
Tomorrow, Ruffians!

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.799
That's our big day!

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:53.980
But then we make our 3D debut!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.060
Yes!

00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:56.321
Moco-chan.

00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:57.661
Which is bigger?

00:16:58.262 --> 00:16:59.762
Nervous or excited?

00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:03.984
Both.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:06.885
Both?

00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:09.706
Well, I'll be excited.

00:17:09.746 --> 00:17:10.686
You'll be nervous?

00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:11.166
Yes!

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:11.946
Okay.

00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:12.366
Yes!

00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:12.847
Yeah.

00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:13.747
We are both.

00:17:14.497 --> 00:17:16.358
Ah, yeah!

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:28.247
It's also, you know, not only is it a day that we're really excited and nervous, it's also the day that you find out really just how fluffy and fuzzy we are!

00:17:28.867 --> 00:17:33.350
You know, even practicing singing and dancing non-stop!

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.254
You know, we worked so, so hard towards this one day!

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.140
Yeah.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.782
Ruffians, we hope you know just how hard that we've worked.

00:17:44.122 --> 00:17:46.504
How many tears we've shed.

00:17:46.584 --> 00:17:48.805
How much we sweat.

00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.646
It's been a long journey.

00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:51.707
It has!

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:52.327
Yeah.

00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:54.848
And tomorrow... It's gonna be great.

00:17:55.088 --> 00:18:00.231
Well, tomorrow will be the result of all our hard work.

00:18:00.251 --> 00:18:00.331
Yeah.

00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:04.073
Please, Ruffians, please look forward to the day!

00:18:04.453 --> 00:18:04.673
Yeah!

00:18:05.154 --> 00:18:05.914
Yeah.

00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:07.215
And, Ruffians,

00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:09.836
Countdown images!

00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:12.940
It says three days left, but it's no longer three days left.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.761
No, it's closer!

00:18:13.962 --> 00:18:17.486
Yeah, much closer.

00:18:17.987 --> 00:18:20.450
What did you think, Ruffians?

00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.452
What do you think?

00:18:21.472 --> 00:18:22.854
Looking a bit fluffy there.

00:18:26.758 --> 00:18:29.459
Yeah!

00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:30.640
Are you excited?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:30.980
Yeah!

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.802
Well, I tweeted about how I'm going to put you into a fluffy hair look.

00:18:36.162 --> 00:18:36.342
Yeah!

00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:37.683
Figuratively.

00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:38.684
Figuratively.

00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:43.706
But it seems like a lot of Ruffians think I might actually... Ruffians?

00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:48.748
I'm an idol, you know!

00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:49.908
Yeah!

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:53.130
And look, I know.

00:18:55.146 --> 00:18:57.188
Well, uh, Ruffians.

00:18:58.649 --> 00:19:07.736
Actually, the Great Okan apparently even thinks that there might be some extreme violence too!

00:19:07.756 --> 00:19:10.498
Yeah, he responded to us on Twitter!

00:19:10.778 --> 00:19:10.958
Yeah!

00:19:10.978 --> 00:19:12.819
We're so surprised!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.083
But, uh, the Great Okan is a really famous pro wrestler in Japan!

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:18.524
Yeah!

00:19:18.604 --> 00:19:22.286
And also is a huge hololive fan too!

00:19:22.506 --> 00:19:22.747
Yeah!

00:19:22.827 --> 00:19:24.388
Yeah... But...

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.881
Maybe he's confused.

00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:32.466
Yeah, I think he's confused too.

00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:36.069
We're idols, Ruffians!

00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:36.469
Yeah!

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:37.470
Demon dogs!

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.471
Got it!

00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:39.452
Got it!

00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:41.834
Have you seen me?

00:19:41.874 --> 00:19:41.914
Oh!

00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:48.622
Wow!

00:19:48.682 --> 00:19:49.162
Hi!

00:19:49.202 --> 00:19:50.323
Two days left!

00:19:50.343 --> 00:19:50.923
Two days!

00:19:50.963 --> 00:19:51.764
We're not at two days!

00:19:51.964 --> 00:19:54.225
I think a Ruffian is at 36 hours.

00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:56.306
Oh, that's like right in between.

00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:59.488
Just about.

00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:02.190
If you think about it, that's like one day left.

00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:04.612
One day plus 12 hours.

00:20:04.952 --> 00:20:05.372
Yeah.

00:20:05.592 --> 00:20:06.553
Is that 36 hours?

00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:07.414
I don't know.

00:20:07.894 --> 00:20:08.114
I think.

00:20:09.435 --> 00:20:11.476
And there's Moco-chan there!

00:20:11.516 --> 00:20:12.036
Yeah!

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:12.917
It's me!

00:20:13.017 --> 00:20:14.238
Looking very fluffy!

00:20:14.258 --> 00:20:14.698
Fluffy?

00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:15.599
A fuzzy.

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:18.873
What is wrong with you today, huh?

00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:21.133
It is opposite day!

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:22.613
Opposite day!

00:20:22.633 --> 00:20:30.215
I'm sorry for offending you so horribly, Moco-chan.

00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:30.775
Thank you!

00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:34.296
Thank you for the apology, huh?

00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:36.776
Okay, you look fuzzy then!

00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:37.416
Got it?

00:20:37.496 --> 00:20:37.996
Thank you!

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:38.816
Got it!

00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:40.097
That is correct!

00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:40.417
Okay.

00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:45.207
Yeah, please look forward to it, okay?

00:20:45.227 --> 00:20:46.287
BAU BAU!

00:20:46.368 --> 00:20:48.569
BAU BAU!

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.611
But we're gonna put our all.

00:20:50.631 --> 00:20:54.894
Hopefully we don't make any mistakes.

00:20:56.515 --> 00:21:01.018
Make sure you wave your penlights lots and lots on BAU BAU for us too, okay?

00:21:01.038 --> 00:21:02.299
Okay, Ruffians!

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:02.760
BAU BAU!

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.020
36 hours.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.078
August 10th, 8pm PT.

00:21:11.118 --> 00:21:12.320
BAU BAU!

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.784
Are you sure that's the time?

00:21:14.804 --> 00:21:14.864
Yes.

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:16.527
No.

00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:17.047
Yes.

00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:17.528
Yes?

00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:17.969
Yes.

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:21.955
Yes.

00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.905
BAU BAU!

00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:28.186
How many times have we been saying it, Moco-chan?

00:21:28.306 --> 00:21:30.587
We've said it so much I can't remember anymore.

00:21:31.387 --> 00:21:32.627
BAU BAU.

00:21:33.307 --> 00:21:34.808
BAU BAU!

00:21:34.948 --> 00:21:40.009
Wow, now that we remember the important things, let's take a look at the other important things.

00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:40.649
Yeah!

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:43.270
Like today's Doggie of the Day!

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.590
We have De-den!

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:45.870
Hanzo!

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:46.691
Hanzo!

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:49.791
The Doggie of the Day!

00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:51.232
I can hear this noise.

00:21:53.236 --> 00:22:04.142
Hanzo's cute!

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:06.304
Just like that!

00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:09.565
Look at all the rules of the fluffles!

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.166
Yeah!

00:22:11.326 --> 00:22:15.969
Very, very cute!

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:18.751
But Hanzo loves to nap.

00:22:19.491 --> 00:22:21.552
Moco-chan, what did we need earlier?

00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:22.593
A nap.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.820
What do we do?

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.921
Practice.

00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:28.102
BAU BAU.

00:22:28.162 --> 00:22:29.142

00:22:51.891 --> 00:23:08.779
I will personally make sure that Hanzo always has the freshest, most comfy smelling sheets in the world.

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:10.120
Personal guarantee.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.221
Fuwawa guarantees it.

00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:16.443
But you know, maybe FUWAMOCO, maybe we can replace that plushie too.

00:23:18.949 --> 00:23:19.770
It does, of course.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.891
Oh, no, it's Pero.

00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:22.352
No!

00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:26.076
I-I-I-Hanzo looks very comfy there.

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.877
I wanna be comfy, too.

00:23:27.897 --> 00:23:28.738
I wanna be nice.

00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:29.419
Yeah.

00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:32.662
BAU BAU!

00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:33.703
BAU BAU!

00:23:33.743 --> 00:23:35.824
Well, Ruffians, the movie continues!

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:38.987
Let's take a look where your paws have been taking you!

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:40.148
We have De-den!

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:52.893
We're so happy that you were able to go for a nice walk after not being home for a little while.

00:23:53.173 --> 00:23:54.514
And with good company.

00:23:54.534 --> 00:24:00.396
We're really happy that you were able to rescue her out of the machine.

00:24:01.891 --> 00:24:05.416
Had Ayame-senpai to accompany you all the places you've been.

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:07.660
You had some good luck there, huh?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.461
Yeah.

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:09.683
Why?

00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:13.168
Thank you for sharing it with us!

00:24:13.488 --> 00:24:14.309
Mama!

00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:19.475
And next, Moco-chan, do we have a question?

00:24:19.696 --> 00:24:20.056
Yeah.

00:24:20.336 --> 00:24:20.576
Oh.

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:25.261
For our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:27.923
I was wondering what you would prefer.

00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:35.910
If we take many screenshots during our upcoming 3D showcase, or fully focus our attention on enjoying your performance?

00:24:35.971 --> 00:24:36.731
Good question.

00:24:38.881 --> 00:24:42.062
Well, I think this duet makes you the most happy.

00:24:42.122 --> 00:24:42.823
Yeah!

00:24:42.963 --> 00:24:51.366
You know, whether that's commenting a lot so that we can see you, or being in a call and BAU BAU-ing together with other Ruffians.

00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:51.766
Right!

00:24:51.806 --> 00:24:53.427
You know, like a WATCH party.

00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:54.467
A WATCH party.

00:24:54.547 --> 00:24:54.807
Yeah.

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:57.468
Maybe live tweeting using our hashtag.

00:24:57.488 --> 00:24:58.369
That would be nice too.

00:24:58.409 --> 00:25:00.270
Don't use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.050
No, no, no.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.411
Making memes.

00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:07.394
Or being the best photographer ever and sharing your pics.

00:25:07.814 --> 00:25:09.355
It's all up to you!

00:25:09.455 --> 00:25:11.376
Whatever is the most fun you know.

00:25:11.556 --> 00:25:16.059
And you can watch it live and then decide to do that afterwards too!

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:18.361
It's up to you, Ruffians!

00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:20.382
Only one hashtag!

00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:21.422
Only one hashtag!

00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:24.084
The hashtag is... Hashtag!

00:25:24.885 --> 00:25:26.366
FWMC3D!

00:25:26.506 --> 00:25:27.026
Got it.

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:29.840
Not that hard.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:30.540
Yeah.

00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:31.421
Yeah.

00:25:32.342 --> 00:25:36.926
I can't believe it's so soon.

00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:37.807
Ruffians!

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:38.968
Do you know what you're gonna do?

00:25:38.988 --> 00:25:40.850
Do you have a plan, Ruffians?

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.671
I usually tweet afterwards.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.073
That's a strategy too, you know?

00:25:46.014 --> 00:25:47.856
It would be cool if... What?

00:25:48.497 --> 00:25:48.957
Twins.

00:25:49.277 --> 00:25:50.999
That would be cool.

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:51.699
Huh?

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.640
FUWAMOCO.

00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:53.881
Trending.

00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:53.961
Huh?

00:25:54.963 --> 00:25:55.764
Trendy.

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:56.584
Trendy.

00:25:56.745 --> 00:25:58.546
Trendy means you're up on the times.

00:25:59.227 --> 00:26:01.889
But you don't call Twitter, Twitter anymore.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.971
I'm gonna trend on Twitter!

00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:05.312
Yay!

00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:06.513
If the Ruffians help.

00:26:06.933 --> 00:26:07.654
Yay!

00:26:08.574 --> 00:26:08.895
BAU BAU!

00:26:08.975 --> 00:26:13.759
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:16.060
All your questions, please send us more questions.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.343
There's been some very good questions recently.

00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:21.265
Also, your Pero Sightings.

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:21.765
Yay!

00:26:21.985 --> 00:26:23.707
I'm sure you can see them around.

00:26:24.836 --> 00:26:25.196
Soon.

00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:25.737
Maybe.

00:26:25.777 --> 00:26:26.097
Maybe.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:28.799
Just a little bit closer, okay?

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.801
And your walks in summertime!

00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:31.802
Go out for a walk!

00:26:32.323 --> 00:26:36.546
And if you maybe see a very cute doggy, maybe that's the Doggie of the Day!

00:26:36.566 --> 00:26:39.469
Let us know with the hashtag!

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:41.811
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:44.153
BAU BAU!

00:26:44.673 --> 00:26:45.354
And next!

00:26:45.434 --> 00:26:51.079
Well, Nerissa's 3D debut is coming up very soon, but before that... Wait!

00:26:51.239 --> 00:26:51.880
We have...

00:26:52.852 --> 00:26:53.252
De-den!

00:26:53.553 --> 00:26:56.936
We're playing the newest hololive game from hololive Indie!

00:26:56.956 --> 00:26:58.237
Treasure Mountain.

00:26:58.357 --> 00:26:59.338
It looks pretty fun.

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:02.701
It looks really fun, very colorful, very cute!

00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:07.105
It looks kinda like a little bit reminiscent of Suica game.

00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:08.046
But not.

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:08.486
It's not.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:09.970
Advent.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.751
Making a mountain.

00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:11.711
Treasure.

00:27:12.051 --> 00:27:13.112
Oh, with our senpai.

00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:14.353
Cause they are the treasure!

00:27:14.393 --> 00:27:16.174
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:22.117
Oh, we're gonna give it a shot and... But we'll see how much fun it really, really is.

00:27:22.177 --> 00:27:24.318
My angel senpai is very loud in it.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.079
Well, we'll see.

00:27:26.139 --> 00:27:29.201
So we're gonna be even louder maybe.

00:27:29.361 --> 00:27:33.263
And then, right after that, it's Nerissa's CD debut!

00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:34.403
Yeah!

00:27:34.464 --> 00:27:35.144
BAU BAU!

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.347

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:40.712
Don't forget the time, okay?

00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:42.354
She has her own hashtag too.

00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:47.221
Can we take a peek at our schedule, Moco-chan?

00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:49.805
Just in case you forgot, there's a theory!

00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:51.787
Happy debut!

00:27:52.107 --> 00:28:00.751
And after that, well, on Sunday at 6pm PT, we're gonna be having an after-party for our debut!

00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:06.474
We'll talk about lots of different stuff this night, and our thoughts on stuff all day.

00:28:06.514 --> 00:28:09.795
You know, what kind of feelings we put into things, you know.

00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:12.336
You definitely wanna hear all the stories.

00:28:12.777 --> 00:28:13.897
The entire day!

00:28:13.977 --> 00:28:15.238

Thank you, Ruffians!

00:28:45.284 --> 00:28:55.816
After today's FUWAMOCO, well, we might be a little bit more fluffy, a little bit more fuzzy, but we hope that

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.271
Just now even more!

00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:01.913
And now you'll join us for more mornings!

00:29:03.914 --> 00:29:04.915
I'm still in this one.

00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:12.780
