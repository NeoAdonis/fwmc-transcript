05:10.600 --> 05:13.034
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:13.514 --> 05:17.197
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.217 --> 05:21.300
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.320 --> 05:21.741
BAU!

05:21.881 --> 05:27.085
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:27.445 --> 05:29.967
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:30.207 --> 05:33.049
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:33.109 --> 05:33.269
BAU!

05:35.130 --> 05:38.832
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.212 --> 05:45.094
Ruffians, thank you for joining us today for our 27th episode!

05:45.514 --> 05:47.995
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:48.675 --> 05:50.196
For first-time ruffians!

05:50.216 --> 05:51.756
First-time ruffians?

05:51.776 --> 05:53.077
First-time ruffians.

05:53.337 --> 05:55.098
Ruffians that are here for the first time.

05:55.198 --> 05:55.458
Yes!

05:55.698 --> 05:57.278
That's what makes you a first-time ruffian.

05:58.979 --> 06:05.964
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show that's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:06.224 --> 06:07.765
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:08.125 --> 06:11.647
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:12.088 --> 06:17.531
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:18.132 --> 06:22.615
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING.

06:23.275 --> 06:27.478
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:27.498 --> 06:28.219
BAU BAU!

06:29.899 --> 06:34.301
A new start to a new day of a new month.

06:35.141 --> 06:38.622
Has he been around recently?

06:38.662 --> 06:41.022
We haven't seen him, but... A Pero Sighting!

06:41.042 --> 06:41.182
De-den!

06:51.021 --> 06:56.703
Pero was found at a cat cafe.

06:56.823 --> 06:57.783
That's nice.

06:58.163 --> 07:05.926
It looks like he was seen trying so hard to fit in with the other cats that he even glued whiskers to his face.

07:06.906 --> 07:09.867
That's kinda uncool, Pero.

07:10.247 --> 07:12.588
Did he do it because he's lonely?

07:12.608 --> 07:14.889
Or because he wants to get closer to the cats?

07:14.909 --> 07:20.211
Or did he do it because he wants the cute girls to visit the cafe to pet him?

07:21.974 --> 07:22.754
That's not good.

07:23.254 --> 07:26.075
You know, to glue whiskers on his face, that's pretty desperate.

07:26.355 --> 07:27.075
Why?

07:27.095 --> 07:29.576
What do you think, ruffians?

07:31.496 --> 07:34.397
You think that Pero is fine just the way he is, right?

07:34.417 --> 07:36.777
He doesn't need the whiskers, right?

07:36.817 --> 07:37.197
Right!

07:37.217 --> 07:42.138
Kick him out!

07:44.099 --> 07:46.939
What if he just wants to enjoy the cats too, huh?

07:46.959 --> 07:50.460
Pero's just... Pero's Pero, you know?

07:51.519 --> 07:53.361
A stern talking to it.

07:53.681 --> 07:58.666
Well, I don't see any ruffians saying that Pero's just fine the way he is, you know.

08:00.267 --> 08:00.948
Well, right.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.369
Well, right.

08:05.031 --> 08:08.455
Well, you know, I think Pero's fine.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.116
He's nasty.

08:11.197 --> 08:12.779
But it'll be okay, right?

08:12.919 --> 08:14.320
One day Pero'll be nice.

08:14.992 --> 08:18.694
I think he's fine in the shape and the way he is.

08:18.734 --> 08:22.236
His personality could get a bit of a makeover.

08:22.576 --> 08:25.938
But we're all, you know, we're all our own individual.

08:26.338 --> 08:29.740
And that should be something that we're all very proud of, you know?

08:30.481 --> 08:30.921
Right?

08:31.961 --> 08:33.322
Ruffians, why didn't you say that?

08:33.742 --> 08:35.724
Pero's gonna be upset if you don't say it.

08:36.264 --> 08:37.445
Don't say that, you know?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.959
Ruffians, remember, okay?

08:41.099 --> 08:46.521
At the very least, we shouldn't really have to worry about that.

08:57.982 --> 08:59.743
But he does have a big tongue.

09:00.103 --> 09:01.523
But the cats should be safe, yeah.

09:01.763 --> 09:02.944
They should be.

09:03.124 --> 09:06.105
But if we were in a cafe, it's a bit of a different story.

09:06.125 --> 09:09.586
But they're safe from Pero, it's good.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.587
BAU BAU!

09:11.987 --> 09:13.427
Thank you, Ruffians!

09:13.847 --> 09:15.968
Please let us know if you see Pero around again.

09:15.988 --> 09:21.670
You can let us know with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING.

09:21.970 --> 09:24.251
BAU BAU!

09:24.271 --> 09:24.691
Ruffians!

09:28.411 --> 09:28.932
October!

09:30.815 --> 09:31.777
It's October!

09:31.937 --> 09:33.439
And with that...

09:38.925 --> 09:39.626
It's a new month!

09:40.246 --> 09:42.087
New hopes, yeah!

09:42.548 --> 09:49.272
You know, and this is the first October FUWAMOCO Morning today, too!

09:49.732 --> 09:57.738
And yeah, like we mentioned, you know, a new month brings new hopes and dreams and goals that we want to reach, too!

09:58.258 --> 10:01.941
Did you spend some time to reflect on how September went for you, Ruffians?

10:03.137 --> 10:08.644
We know that some people might think it's silly, but we think that reflecting is a really good habit.

10:09.044 --> 10:10.186
We do it often, right?

10:11.487 --> 10:13.309
What did you think of your September high?

10:14.311 --> 10:17.194
Were you able to reach your goals?

10:18.191 --> 10:21.233
You know, what went well, what could've been better.

10:21.253 --> 10:28.696
I think for most people, and even us of course, you know, I don't think everything goes perfectly all the time.

10:29.277 --> 10:31.738
But you know, we were tired in September.

10:32.258 --> 10:35.740
And some things went well, other things could've been better.

10:36.621 --> 10:40.543
So, let's take some time, think about it, and figure out.

10:41.437 --> 10:42.938
What do we want for October?

10:42.958 --> 10:44.298
Exactly.

10:44.559 --> 10:47.220
How can we better aim for that, you know?

10:47.600 --> 10:53.003
I think, for us, for FUWAMOCO, we want to focus more on our guard dog training, right?

10:54.484 --> 10:55.164
Yeah.

10:55.484 --> 10:55.824
Right.

10:55.924 --> 10:57.405
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

10:59.086 --> 10:59.546
Maybe.

11:00.647 --> 11:01.967
I don't know, maybe not.

11:02.027 --> 11:03.888
Maybe, maybe yes, maybe not, maybe.

11:04.429 --> 11:08.351
But, you're gonna have to hold our paw for that, okay?

11:08.771 --> 11:10.452
It's gonna be tough, so, okay?

11:11.909 --> 11:12.549
You're good for it.

11:12.850 --> 11:13.330
For the eye.

11:13.570 --> 11:14.251
Ruffians!

11:16.892 --> 11:18.974
Oh, that looks like ruffians' eye.

11:19.094 --> 11:20.395
Okay.

11:21.255 --> 11:21.755
Okay.

11:22.136 --> 11:24.397
We'll work hard on that for October, okay?

11:26.438 --> 11:35.304
But we also want to work on our sleeping habits and patterns so we can be more effective guard dogs and protect even more ruffian smiles, okay?

11:38.526 --> 11:40.828
I think you know.

11:43.022 --> 11:52.584
Also, in October, maybe it sounds a bit weird too, but they really like to lean on the other members more too.

11:53.384 --> 11:53.704
I know.

11:54.205 --> 11:56.505
After talking to them, we're always so happy.

11:56.885 --> 11:57.785
So it would be nice.

12:00.246 --> 12:05.567
Let's work hard towards becoming even stronger together for October, okay, ruffians?

12:07.222 --> 12:08.143
BAU BAU!

12:08.203 --> 12:09.225
BAU BAU!

12:09.245 --> 12:10.086
It's October.

12:10.246 --> 12:10.487
Bye.

12:10.687 --> 12:16.355
Actually there was some really good news.

12:16.455 --> 12:17.396
Happy news!

12:18.017 --> 12:20.701
I don't know if you realize, ruffians, but...

12:22.068 --> 12:28.572
We have over 100 videos on our FUWAMOCO channel now!

12:29.972 --> 12:31.453
Wow, Ruffians!

12:31.553 --> 12:35.395
It's only two months and we already have over 100 videos!

12:35.455 --> 12:36.836
Right!

12:37.276 --> 12:38.017
Right!

12:38.617 --> 12:39.878
So fast!

12:40.078 --> 12:41.519
So fast!

12:41.799 --> 12:44.800
Thank you for supporting us, Ruffians!

12:44.880 --> 12:46.001
Thank you!

12:46.021 --> 12:51.244
You know, it's not quite 100 livestreams, including no membership and unarchived streams yet, but...

12:51.804 --> 12:52.185
Soon.

12:53.246 --> 12:54.708
Very soon for sure.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.249
We'll be there!

12:57.050 --> 12:59.754
We can't wait until we hit 1,000 videos someday in 5-5 years.

12:59.794 --> 13:03.838
But if we hit 100 in 2 months, then can't you do the math?

13:03.858 --> 13:04.159
20 months?

13:12.830 --> 13:14.550
What's the math on that, ruffians?

13:15.090 --> 13:15.450
Do the math!

13:15.931 --> 13:20.371
I don't think it's gonna be something that you can just solve with a math equation, though.

13:20.891 --> 13:21.932
Math equation?

13:21.992 --> 13:22.892
Math equation.

13:24.532 --> 13:25.892
I don't think so, you know.

13:25.912 --> 13:26.312
20 months.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.653
One year and eight months.

13:30.453 --> 13:32.694
Okay, two years.

13:33.034 --> 13:33.614
Two years.

13:33.634 --> 13:35.194
That's the goal.

13:35.754 --> 13:36.554
Two years?

13:36.574 --> 13:37.575
Two years.

13:37.815 --> 13:39.235
Should we try, ruffians?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.935
That might be really tricky, Domoco-chan, you know?

13:43.195 --> 13:44.336
I think it might be tricky.

13:45.557 --> 13:46.117
Three years.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.019
Let's make the goal three years, okay?

13:48.279 --> 13:50.901
I don't know if the math is good, but three years, okay?

13:51.061 --> 13:57.046
Actually, I was taking a peek at some of our senpai's channels to see who has a thousand videos.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.528
And I was surprised to see which senpai do and maybe don't.

14:01.309 --> 14:01.649
Right?

14:01.709 --> 14:06.073
But it also makes sense because they're very busy in lots of different ways, too.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.755
Should we hope to also be busy, too?

14:11.718 --> 14:12.619
We're gonna be busy.

14:13.760 --> 14:22.026
But you know, it's also happy to be busy outside of YouTube too, so... Let's do our best!

14:22.627 --> 14:24.949
I want everything too.

14:25.369 --> 14:26.610
Greedy.

14:26.750 --> 14:27.230
I'm greedy.

14:27.331 --> 14:35.537
We'll continue to work hard here and outside of YouTube too, you know, whether it be streams or videos or sorts.

14:37.245 --> 14:42.266
BAU BAU!

14:43.706 --> 14:46.447
And it's also another special day.

14:46.467 --> 14:51.568
It's a special day today, not just our first October FUWAMOCO Morning.

14:52.068 --> 14:56.629
But, ruffians, I don't know, maybe there's some ruffians that realized it.

14:57.289 --> 14:59.890
Ruffians, can you guess what special day it is today?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.177
Okay, I'll give you a clue.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.259
It is October 2nd.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.821
October 2nd.

15:09.081 --> 15:11.143
That's the day today.

15:11.283 --> 15:11.823
It is.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.969
It doesn't have to do with Monday.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.031
Or Natto.

15:20.551 --> 15:22.513
Not that much.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.655
Korone-senpai's birthday was yesterday though.

15:31.035 --> 15:31.335
Is it?

15:32.136 --> 15:32.957
You know.

15:34.978 --> 15:38.160
Special.

15:38.301 --> 15:39.521
Okay, let's give it to them.

15:39.541 --> 15:41.423
Okay, the ruffians didn't call it.

15:42.003 --> 15:45.666
Wow, I can't believe you didn't know this, ruffians!

15:45.806 --> 15:46.767
Okay!

15:46.787 --> 15:50.129
Today is... Tofu Day!

15:53.297 --> 15:57.360
October 2nd is Tofu Day!

15:57.380 --> 15:58.700
It's Tofu Day!

15:59.141 --> 16:04.244
Ten can be read in Japanese as To and Chu and Fu, so Tofu.

16:06.585 --> 16:07.566
I bet you're surprised.

16:07.606 --> 16:10.588
You didn't even know it was a day to celebrate, huh?

16:10.628 --> 16:12.229
Tofu Day!

16:12.529 --> 16:14.991
Toho Day would be cool too, but...

16:15.891 --> 16:17.432
Not today, you know.

16:18.093 --> 16:21.295
Yeah, you know, but tofu is so yummy!

16:21.615 --> 16:30.241
I think there might be some ruffians who think tofu doesn't have much flavor to it, but that's exactly why tofu is wonderful too!

16:30.341 --> 16:33.182
You know, it's a blank canvas for your favorite flavors.

16:33.222 --> 16:35.824
There's so many different things you can do with it!

16:35.904 --> 16:36.445
Right!

16:36.525 --> 16:38.406
You can make it spicy, you can make it...

16:38.846 --> 16:41.528
If you like that, I guess, you can make a deep fry.

16:41.829 --> 16:43.270
You can put it in the soup.

16:43.430 --> 16:44.991
Oh yeah, you can deep fry it.

16:45.011 --> 16:45.572
You can.

16:45.752 --> 16:47.694
I just thought it might be dangerous.

16:48.815 --> 16:49.996
Also!

16:50.476 --> 16:52.738
It's not tofu, but it's like in the family.

16:52.758 --> 16:53.338
The family.

16:53.358 --> 16:54.539
The tofu family.

16:54.599 --> 16:55.820
Soy milk!

16:55.880 --> 16:56.481
Yeah!

16:57.021 --> 16:59.323
Or as we like to call it, tofu milk.

16:59.363 --> 17:00.364
Tofu milk!

17:00.685 --> 17:01.465
Yeah!

17:01.625 --> 17:02.606
Tofu milk!

17:02.626 --> 17:05.909
We've talked about it before, but we really like soy milk.

17:06.469 --> 17:08.471
My favorite is Kikkoman.

17:08.551 --> 17:10.252
Yeah, Kikkoman.

17:10.632 --> 17:13.315
You know when we were doing guard dog training in Japan?

17:13.335 --> 17:18.619
At one point, we got so addicted to the black tea flavor that they would sell.

17:21.263 --> 17:26.909
It was so bad at one point that we bought big cartons by the box.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.651
By the box, yeah.

17:29.092 --> 17:30.693
It's just so yummy!

17:30.934 --> 17:35.919
But they have different flavors too, like not just the black tea flavor, not just the milk.

17:36.279 --> 17:39.423
They have a lot of flavors.

17:39.503 --> 17:42.846
And our second favorite flavor is the red bean flavor.

17:44.082 --> 17:48.844
Ruffians, think of a flavor that you think would be good for soy milk.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.465
Which flavor do you think would be enticing to you?

17:59.788 --> 18:00.689
Never had tofu before.

18:00.709 --> 18:02.570
Vanilla, they have vanilla!

18:02.830 --> 18:04.330
Almond, they have almond!

18:04.350 --> 18:05.371
Cucumber, they don't have that.

18:05.571 --> 18:06.631
Banana milk, they have that!

18:06.671 --> 18:07.772
Strawberry, they have that!

18:08.532 --> 18:09.133
Strawberry, yes!

18:09.173 --> 18:09.833
Matcha, yes!

18:09.893 --> 18:10.653
Chocolate, yes!

18:11.114 --> 18:12.294
Maple, I'm sure they must.

18:13.355 --> 18:15.056
Pineapple, yes!

18:15.336 --> 18:16.316
Sea chocolate, yes!

18:16.336 --> 18:17.317
Azuki, yes!

18:17.337 --> 18:19.998
So many flavors!

18:20.778 --> 18:21.819
Lavender, maybe not.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.300
It's a bit fancy, but maybe!

18:23.900 --> 18:24.640
Light tea, yes!

18:26.081 --> 18:26.901
Light sesame, yes!

18:29.269 --> 18:31.030
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

18:43.863 --> 18:49.887
Maybe one day we'll buy as many as we can and taste test them all for you!

18:50.527 --> 18:53.129
Buy a lot of different flavors, you know?

18:53.729 --> 19:00.834
It's a bit of a silly mini dream, but a big soy milk party and taste all the flavors.

19:01.114 --> 19:02.254
It sounds fun, right?

19:02.294 --> 19:03.035
Yeah!

19:03.295 --> 19:06.597
You'll have to drink lots of soy milk with us too, Ruffians, okay?

19:06.637 --> 19:11.860
Just a little tiny of each flavor, but it'll be a lot of soy milk.

19:13.801 --> 19:15.582
BAU BAU!

19:15.962 --> 19:18.183
Happy Tofu Day, Ruffians!

19:18.203 --> 19:21.364
Let's all celebrate by eating tofu.

19:21.384 --> 19:24.705
Yeah, don't have it this straight if you don't want that.

19:24.785 --> 19:25.425
Not like this.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.846
It looks like a block of paper.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.107
BAU BAU!

19:33.168 --> 19:34.768
Such a happy... Happy day.

19:34.968 --> 19:35.769
Happy day.

19:35.869 --> 19:36.449
Happy day.

19:38.270 --> 19:38.430
But...

19:44.980 --> 19:47.921
Ruffians.

19:48.261 --> 19:56.723
To be honest, today, we thought we could maybe get to today without any misunderstandings, you know?

19:57.063 --> 20:03.065
But accidentally, we made a misunderstanding ourselves.

20:03.725 --> 20:04.245
We did.

20:04.265 --> 20:05.526
Yeah.

20:09.327 --> 20:10.687
Do you realize what we lost?

20:11.567 --> 20:17.573
You realize we were trying so hard to not make any misunderstandings, too.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.776
Aren't we always trying to avoid the misunderstandings?

20:22.137 --> 20:23.779
We never cause them ourselves, right?

20:25.801 --> 20:30.906
But, well, I guess... Ruffians!

20:31.186 --> 20:34.649
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, there was something weird, right?

20:34.669 --> 20:34.830
No.

20:35.754 --> 20:36.014
Right?

20:36.595 --> 20:37.596
You noticed it, right?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.899
I think the ruffians noticed it, Moco-chan.

20:41.900 --> 20:42.540
I don't know.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.324
Well, you know, there was no misunderstanding.

20:46.384 --> 20:47.344
No mention of it.

20:47.845 --> 20:48.445
Nothing!

20:49.046 --> 20:49.927
Nothing at all.

20:50.187 --> 20:52.009
We're sorry if we disappointed you.

20:53.270 --> 20:55.852
But, but, it's okay.

20:56.112 --> 20:57.854
Because, you know, there was none.

20:57.934 --> 20:59.555
There was no misunderstanding.

21:00.635 --> 21:06.537
Not until now, so, uh, yeah, uh, we had no misunderstandings last time.

21:06.797 --> 21:07.397
Yay.

21:07.417 --> 21:10.198
Do you think we could do this trick, Moco-chan?

21:10.218 --> 21:16.119
No, no, no, no, because we inadvertently made another one by forgetting it last time.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.580
Ruffians!

21:18.740 --> 21:20.880
We'll try better next time, okay?

21:20.900 --> 21:21.220
Yeah.

21:24.088 --> 21:24.469
One day.

21:25.010 --> 21:25.711
A future.

21:26.211 --> 21:28.635
A future without misunderstandings.

21:28.695 --> 21:29.055
One day.

21:29.296 --> 21:29.676
One day.

21:30.177 --> 21:32.520
It'll be a beautiful, sparkly day.

21:38.689 --> 21:41.171
Celebrate with us, okay ruffians?

21:41.952 --> 21:47.577
Well ruffians, it's the start of a new week for the fifth time.

21:47.597 --> 21:55.103
The start of a new week, which means... Oh, oh, and it's also, it's also Tofu Day.

21:56.736 --> 21:57.176
Extra.

21:57.376 --> 22:06.619
Extra means that Moco-chan will be continuing to challenge herself to eat natto today!

22:07.299 --> 22:11.740
Today this is Moco-chan's fourth time trying to eat natto.

22:11.780 --> 22:12.900
To try to conquer.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.440
To overcome it.

22:14.821 --> 22:15.881
To challenge yourself.

22:16.561 --> 22:18.321
I don't want the fluffiness!

22:18.741 --> 22:20.202
I want the fuzziness!

22:20.242 --> 22:20.302
No...

22:45.686 --> 22:46.426
Oh no, just a little bit.

22:46.446 --> 22:47.066
Just a little bit.

22:47.226 --> 22:49.127
Just a little bit.

22:49.207 --> 22:51.907
But yes, natto is really healthy for you.

22:52.408 --> 22:53.948
And this is why we want Moco-chan to eat it.

22:53.968 --> 22:55.248
I do want to eat it.

22:55.528 --> 22:56.869
Okay, I do want to eat it.

22:56.929 --> 23:03.850
But if you cook it, then you know you can continue to protect the ruffian smile for many, many years to come.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.551
Just like me.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.371
But ruffians, you feel inspired, right?

23:08.391 --> 23:10.152
By my challenge, right?

23:10.172 --> 23:11.352
Because I do want to eat it.

23:12.253 --> 23:13.575
But this is difficult.

23:14.175 --> 23:18.842
And I want to do it, but if someone wants to push me to it, I don't want to do it.

23:20.124 --> 23:22.247
I feel inspired!

23:23.177 --> 23:23.737
Right!

23:23.757 --> 23:27.700
If you're hot, Mococo is working hard!

23:28.160 --> 23:30.362
And something difficult that she wants to do!

23:30.382 --> 23:30.502
Yeah!

23:31.882 --> 23:33.904
So I'm gonna work hard too, right?

23:33.924 --> 23:35.725
I think she's extra ready.

23:35.765 --> 23:37.466
Cuz I'm doing it for you, okay?!

23:38.226 --> 23:40.288
It's extra ready, Moco-chan!

23:40.308 --> 23:41.288
What does that mean?

23:41.388 --> 23:43.229
It smells very strong today.

23:43.310 --> 23:43.670
Why?

23:45.492 --> 23:49.093
Maybe just because this natto is very... It's the same.

23:49.273 --> 23:49.713
Happy.

23:50.093 --> 23:50.393
Happy.

23:50.413 --> 23:51.554
It's the same as always.

23:51.574 --> 23:53.054
It's different, natto.

23:53.074 --> 23:53.674
Tochigi!

23:53.914 --> 23:54.975
Tochigi!

23:55.595 --> 23:58.676
I'm not stalling, I'm telling you my life story.

23:59.916 --> 24:14.240
Well, you know, I've seen some Japanese ruffians saying that maybe they should let Moco-chan put the tare sauce on top of it, but... You know, Moco-chan's strong, and I feel like it's more polite to the beans this way, too, so... Oh, it doesn't expire.

24:14.260 --> 24:14.880
I think I can do it.

24:15.540 --> 24:16.542
Natto doesn't expire.

24:16.682 --> 24:20.265
It just gets dry, so it's not yummy.

24:20.746 --> 24:26.151
But Moco-chan, today your goal is three beans.

24:26.652 --> 24:28.013
I would like to sleep more.

24:28.073 --> 24:30.736
No, because I wasn't able to eat three last time.

24:30.756 --> 24:32.378
What's the extra bean, Moco-chan?

24:32.418 --> 24:33.679
I don't have a tissue.

24:34.912 --> 24:36.352
Okay, Moco-chan!

24:36.412 --> 24:37.173
I'm not ready!

24:37.213 --> 24:40.234
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi!

24:40.534 --> 24:42.354
Who worked very hard to make this.

24:42.494 --> 24:44.495
Thank you, I know you worked really hard.

24:45.015 --> 24:46.196
It's not gonna get wasted.

24:46.216 --> 24:50.517
Just so you know, ruffians, Fuwawa always eats it, so it's not wasted, okay?

24:51.317 --> 24:52.158
Very important.

24:52.998 --> 24:55.759
Okay, well, Moco-chan, here you are!

24:55.779 --> 24:58.440
You're right, it does smell really strong today.

24:58.460 --> 25:01.481
I have Moco-chan's favorite chopsticks for her, too.

25:02.101 --> 25:02.581
No tissue, though.

25:03.877 --> 25:04.537
I have a tissue.

25:04.557 --> 25:05.038
No tissue.

25:05.078 --> 25:05.478
Forget that.

25:05.498 --> 25:06.279
I really want a tissue.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.079
Forget that.

25:07.479 --> 25:09.060
Tissue's not gonna go in your mouth.

25:09.521 --> 25:17.666
It's the natto that's gonna... It's so neba neba today.

25:17.686 --> 25:18.586
Take your virus from Tochigi.

25:18.626 --> 25:19.727
Thank you.

25:20.107 --> 25:21.728
It's so neba neba today.

25:22.249 --> 25:23.550
Very slimy, huh?

25:24.150 --> 25:24.850
Very sticky.

25:32.774 --> 25:34.915
Once again, I'm looking for some good beans, okay?

25:35.215 --> 25:36.075
Good beans?

25:36.716 --> 25:37.936
They're all good though.

25:38.816 --> 25:40.717
Particularly good beans, okay?

25:42.398 --> 25:43.738
They're all good.

25:43.918 --> 25:49.700
Are you sure you can't just, um, use... Get the neba neba off of it?

25:50.721 --> 25:51.101
No.

25:52.034 --> 25:53.135
Okay, Moco-chan, hurry up!

25:53.335 --> 25:53.935
Hurry up!

25:54.636 --> 25:54.996
I'm trying!

25:55.016 --> 25:55.256
I'm trying!

25:55.276 --> 25:57.197
Don't call me a dude!

25:57.237 --> 25:57.397
Why?

26:12.605 --> 26:13.465
This is just one bean.

26:13.525 --> 26:14.885
I'm trying to get them.

26:14.965 --> 26:16.606
Are you going to go one bean at a time?

26:16.646 --> 26:17.646
No, of course not.

26:17.686 --> 26:20.587
I'm trying to gather... Why is it so neba neba?

26:20.627 --> 26:22.127
Where's the non-neba neba one?

26:22.807 --> 26:24.567
No, you need to eat them all.

26:24.907 --> 26:29.968
I just smelled it a bit.

26:30.068 --> 26:31.589
It just wafted over here.

26:31.649 --> 26:32.849
I didn't even get close.

26:33.389 --> 26:37.350
Wow, you didn't even give it permission to waft over here.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.270
I didn't.

26:39.713 --> 26:40.954
Why is it bad today?

26:40.974 --> 26:45.216
Moco-chan already had something to eat, too.

26:45.356 --> 26:45.816
I didn't.

26:45.976 --> 26:46.737
Yeah, that's true.

26:46.857 --> 26:47.237
Oh, I did!

26:48.257 --> 26:48.978
I forgot.

26:49.398 --> 26:51.219
I gave you soup, remember?

26:51.339 --> 26:53.400
Okay, I'm trying to stack them.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.701
Stack the beans like Tetris.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.483
Moco-chan, that's playing with your food.

26:58.503 --> 26:59.283
That's not good.

26:59.303 --> 27:00.083
Ah, it's not!

27:00.103 --> 27:01.004
Because they're sticky.

27:03.325 --> 27:06.667
Wait, so the Tetris pieces are just sticky and they're not for you?

27:12.680 --> 27:16.563
One second, one second, one second!

27:18.164 --> 27:19.245
It's time, Moco-chan.

27:22.717 --> 27:24.738
I'm not being evil, I'm being supportive.

27:24.758 --> 27:26.238
Moco-chan wants to do this.

27:26.258 --> 27:28.399
Moco-chan, you want to do this, right?

27:28.419 --> 27:29.699
But I actually need a tissue.

27:29.719 --> 27:31.840
Because I actually need a tissue.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.061
I don't know what to do, Moco-chan.

27:34.561 --> 27:35.821
I actually need a tissue.

27:37.802 --> 27:39.002
What if you just eat it?

27:39.022 --> 27:41.843
Don't use the tissue, you need to eat it, Moco-chan.

27:41.943 --> 27:43.223
Every time you don't eat it.

27:43.243 --> 27:45.704
It just goes in your mouth and then you spit it out.

27:45.744 --> 27:46.404
It's not good.

27:46.524 --> 27:47.765
I'm doing my best, okay?

27:47.785 --> 27:48.445
That's not good!

27:50.834 --> 27:52.655
You're serious about this, right Moco-chan?

27:52.735 --> 27:53.556
I'm serious.

27:53.856 --> 27:54.317
Are you?

27:54.337 --> 27:55.598
Okay.

27:55.658 --> 27:56.839
I don't know, ruffians.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.061
That's one... Three beans!

27:59.181 --> 28:00.782
Oh, that is three beans.

28:00.902 --> 28:03.325
I have confirmed that is definitely three beans.

28:04.185 --> 28:04.566
Okay.

28:04.586 --> 28:06.267
Okay Moco-chan, you're gonna do it!

28:09.949 --> 28:13.833
I'm trying to get used to the smell because I was already done in by it, okay?

28:14.213 --> 28:15.134
It's getting close.

28:16.014 --> 28:18.336
I'm just trying to like, get used to it, okay?

28:18.356 --> 28:19.697
Open wide, Mococo!

28:20.078 --> 28:21.839
Not yet, not yet.

28:24.190 --> 28:25.090
Moco-chan, you can do it!

28:25.150 --> 28:25.670
You can do it!

28:26.091 --> 28:26.471
Wow.

28:26.911 --> 28:27.151
Wow.

28:27.251 --> 28:31.132
I don't know if I'm a ruffian or not, but I sneezed five times in a row because my nose is very, uh, not working today, but now I feel like it is.

28:31.152 --> 28:31.412
That's good.

28:31.432 --> 28:33.453
See, good things happen when you have natto, Moco-chan.

28:33.473 --> 28:34.053
I'm just smelling it.

28:34.073 --> 28:34.693
I'm just smelling it.

28:34.753 --> 28:35.333
I'm just smelling it.

28:35.353 --> 28:36.333
I'm just smelling it.

28:36.353 --> 28:36.814
I'm just smelling it.

28:36.834 --> 28:37.254
I'm just smelling it.

28:37.274 --> 28:37.734
I'm just smelling it.

28:37.754 --> 28:38.154
I'm just smelling it.

28:38.174 --> 28:38.614
I'm just smelling it.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.074
I'm just smelling it.

28:39.094 --> 28:39.514
I'm just smelling it.

28:39.534 --> 28:39.994
I'm just smelling it.

28:40.555 --> 28:43.735
I'm just smelling it.

28:43.775 --> 28:44.236
I'm just smelling it.

28:44.256 --> 28:44.816
I'm just smelling it.

28:44.856 --> 28:45.336
I'm just smelling it.

28:45.396 --> 28:47.096
I'm just smelling it.

28:47.116 --> 28:47.597
I'm just smelling it.

28:47.617 --> 28:48.037
I'm just smelling it.

28:48.057 --> 28:49.577
I'm just smelling it.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.057
I'm just smelling it.

28:50.077 --> 28:50.537
I'm just smelling it.

28:50.557 --> 28:52.438
I'm just smelling it.

28:52.458 --> 28:52.638
I'm just

28:53.336 --> 28:54.176
Okay, ready?

28:55.957 --> 28:57.037
Should I chew it?

28:57.577 --> 28:58.957
You should eat it, Moco-chan.

28:59.477 --> 29:00.637
You know you need to chew to eat it.

29:00.658 --> 29:02.718
Can you promise me I will have water after?

29:03.118 --> 29:04.138
As long as I chew it.

29:04.498 --> 29:06.699
As long as it stays in you, you know?

29:06.779 --> 29:07.059
What?

29:07.179 --> 29:07.999
That you eat it.

29:08.859 --> 29:10.720
That doesn't go into the tissue.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.380
Can I use the tissue on my tongue after?

29:14.400 --> 29:16.401
Not on the tongue.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.341
You can use it on your lips.

29:18.921 --> 29:19.921
Like a napkin.

29:20.382 --> 29:21.722
I wanna use it on my tongue.

29:22.122 --> 29:22.202
No.

29:24.925 --> 29:27.226
I'm trying to figure out my strategy, okay?

29:28.886 --> 29:29.466
Moco-chan!

29:29.486 --> 29:31.107
I'm trying, I'm trying!

29:31.187 --> 29:32.427
It's been five minutes!

29:33.147 --> 29:33.627
Fii!

29:33.987 --> 29:35.368
No, no, no, no!

29:36.328 --> 29:37.128
I'm stopping you.

29:38.128 --> 29:38.428
Okay.

29:39.789 --> 29:41.429
Please don't let the fish in.

29:41.689 --> 29:42.809
I'm not stalling!

29:43.349 --> 29:44.330
I am preparing.

29:48.345 --> 29:49.226
Okay, Moco-chan!

29:49.727 --> 29:51.309
Here we go!

29:51.329 --> 29:51.309
10!

29:52.210 --> 29:52.730
8!

29:52.570 --> 29:52.730
No, 10!

29:52.770 --> 29:52.730
9!

29:52.990 --> 29:52.730
8!

29:53.191 --> 29:52.730
7!

29:53.211 --> 29:52.730
6!

29:53.231 --> 29:52.730
5!

29:53.251 --> 29:52.730
4!

29:54.072 --> 29:52.730
3!

29:54.092 --> 29:52.730
2! 1!

30:04.603 --> 30:05.264
I tried!

30:05.424 --> 30:05.884
I tried!

30:05.904 --> 30:06.585
Give me a moment!

30:06.625 --> 30:07.405
Give me a moment!

30:08.426 --> 30:08.766
Do it!

30:08.946 --> 30:09.206
Go!

30:09.566 --> 30:09.927
Go!

30:10.407 --> 30:10.747
Go!

30:11.708 --> 30:12.948
In!

30:13.349 --> 30:14.949
This is so pathetic.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.690
Do it!

30:17.411 --> 30:18.331
Moco-chan.

30:21.353 --> 30:25.576
You're just opening your mouth and it's floating and then going away.

30:25.596 --> 30:27.597
Moco-chan, don't think, just do!

30:27.677 --> 30:28.537
Exactly!

30:28.737 --> 30:29.378
Exactly!

30:31.639 --> 30:32.982
I'm gonna turn off my brain, okay?

30:33.002 --> 30:33.603
Turn it off!

30:33.743 --> 30:34.284
You're eating!

30:34.304 --> 30:35.627
Okay, brain off.

30:35.647 --> 30:36.047
Brain off!

30:37.458 --> 30:37.978
In it goes.

30:38.739 --> 30:39.759
I can't turn it off.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.260
My brain wants to stay on.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.641
Mocoto.

30:42.681 --> 30:43.741
I really want to try.

30:43.821 --> 30:44.862
I really want to try.

30:44.902 --> 30:46.663
You want to do this, right?

30:46.703 --> 30:48.104
You want to do this?

30:48.144 --> 30:49.925
You want to do this?

30:50.405 --> 30:50.585
Okay.

30:50.605 --> 30:50.585
3, 2, 1.

30:51.405 --> 30:52.006
I want to do it.

30:52.066 --> 30:52.626
Don't stop.

30:52.806 --> 30:53.887
Don't, don't, don't.

30:53.927 --> 30:55.488
Don't stop.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.189
Wait, Shizu.

30:57.349 --> 30:57.689
Don't.

30:57.729 --> 30:58.409
Wait, stop.

30:58.529 --> 31:00.450
Okay, I want to do it.

31:00.850 --> 31:01.691
I want to do it.

31:02.051 --> 31:02.812
I want to do it.

31:04.269 --> 31:06.111
Here we go!

31:06.131 --> 31:06.111
3, 2, 1!

31:07.652 --> 31:07.972
It's in!

31:08.173 --> 31:08.473
It's in!

31:08.653 --> 31:08.973
It's in!

31:09.314 --> 31:10.255
Oh, it got some strings.

31:10.435 --> 31:11.756
Moco-chan's wiping her lips.

31:11.816 --> 31:12.296
That's good.

31:12.877 --> 31:13.137
Chew it!

31:13.237 --> 31:13.498
Chew it!

31:13.558 --> 31:14.719
Don't spit it out!

31:14.739 --> 31:14.999
Chew it!

31:16.460 --> 31:16.901
Chew it!

31:17.701 --> 31:17.822
Oh!

31:18.462 --> 31:18.622
Oh!

31:18.642 --> 31:19.203
Swallow!

31:19.223 --> 31:20.284
Swallow!

31:20.484 --> 31:21.125
You can do it!

31:21.485 --> 31:22.646
You can do it!

31:22.706 --> 31:23.627
You can do it!

31:24.287 --> 31:24.508
Yeah!

31:24.568 --> 31:25.048
Yeah!

31:25.248 --> 31:25.869
Yeah!

31:25.969 --> 31:26.069
Oh!

31:26.429 --> 31:26.570
Oh!

31:26.890 --> 31:26.990
Oh?

31:31.543 --> 31:35.345
Wait, you didn't chew it at all!

31:35.385 --> 31:36.786
They just sat in there!

31:36.886 --> 31:41.349
I tried!

31:41.569 --> 31:42.309
I tried!

31:42.329 --> 31:46.252
I had it in my mouth for so long!

31:46.312 --> 31:47.432
It was good, though!

31:47.452 --> 31:49.013
I tried!

31:49.193 --> 31:49.814
It was yummy!

31:49.934 --> 31:51.495
I left tears, though!

31:51.515 --> 31:55.337
I tried really hard, ruffians!

32:02.088 --> 32:07.112
That was another attempt.

32:08.873 --> 32:13.516
Let's remember Moco-chan's struggles.

32:13.536 --> 32:17.818
Moco-chan's struggles to overcome her hardship with natto.

32:17.918 --> 32:22.321
And let's do our best to overcome our own troubles this week too, okay?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.403
BAU BAU!

32:24.483 --> 32:24.963
I tried.

32:25.403 --> 32:26.304
Moco-chan, say BAU BAU.

32:29.577 --> 32:30.517
BAU BAU!

32:31.137 --> 32:31.418
BAU BAU!

32:31.458 --> 32:34.679
BAU BAU!

32:35.059 --> 32:35.599
I tried.

32:36.399 --> 32:36.979
I tried.

32:37.079 --> 32:38.100
You did, you did.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.160
I need hand pads and I don't have water.

32:40.540 --> 32:43.881
Give me hand pads and tissues with my tears and water, please.

32:44.821 --> 32:46.662
Renato was in there for a while.

32:46.782 --> 32:47.862
I was really excited.

32:48.002 --> 32:49.223
I thought you could do it, Moco-chan.

32:51.480 --> 32:55.383
Next time... Doggie of the Day!

32:55.403 --> 33:01.207
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Sky!

33:01.808 --> 33:03.409
Look at Sky!

33:09.400 --> 33:11.321
Look at the eyes!

33:11.341 --> 33:12.842
It's like my eyes right now!

33:12.862 --> 33:13.663
It's really cute, right?

33:28.852 --> 33:29.933
Right?

33:30.373 --> 33:35.878
It's like the eyes saying, I've had enough natto, can I go home now?

33:36.779 --> 33:37.199
No!

33:37.219 --> 33:38.680
No, you don't!

33:38.901 --> 33:41.223
These eyes love natto!

33:41.803 --> 33:42.644
They're excited!

33:42.724 --> 33:44.285
They have energy!

33:44.305 --> 33:45.106
They can do it!

33:45.426 --> 33:47.808
Their eyes have a good time, right?

33:48.589 --> 33:50.610
Right?

33:50.630 --> 33:53.833
So cute!

33:54.073 --> 33:56.756
Well, Moco-chan, how does Sky say BAU BAU?

33:57.950 --> 34:03.696
I think that's Moco-chan's heart saying BAU BAU.

34:04.878 --> 34:10.844
I don't know, I think it's when I got BAU BAU, right?

34:11.705 --> 34:12.807
I think you know Sky?

34:13.147 --> 34:13.507
Sky?

34:15.666 --> 34:16.506
It's doing the best.

34:16.606 --> 34:16.946
Yes!

34:17.006 --> 34:20.868
It's good to go for walks, but... Yeah, all dogs are a bit different, right?

34:21.148 --> 34:21.588
Ah, right.

34:21.948 --> 34:27.190
And maybe Sky likes to be on the couch more than out in nature getting exercise.

34:27.310 --> 34:28.230
Maybe some days.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.391
That's fine, I guess.

34:29.411 --> 34:31.812
Yeah, I think that's totally fine, you know?

34:31.912 --> 34:35.133
So... But... I don't know.

34:35.433 --> 34:43.736
On those days when we're just like, I don't wanna go outside, I think it's okay to just curl up on the couch, you know?

34:44.529 --> 34:46.070
Today I went on a walk!

34:46.711 --> 34:48.532
Where did this ruffian go for a walk?

34:48.632 --> 34:48.952
De-den!

35:06.631 --> 35:07.712
It's Akihabara.

35:07.752 --> 35:10.214
A walk in Akihabara!

35:10.274 --> 35:11.115
Mansei Baishi!

35:11.135 --> 35:14.038
This photo is from the Mansei Baishi bridge.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.600
Looking gorgeous, kind of.

35:17.260 --> 35:18.081
It's so pretty.

35:18.141 --> 35:20.163
I don't know if we've ever seen it quite like this.

35:20.263 --> 35:20.683
Really?

35:20.763 --> 35:22.004
It's nice.

35:22.165 --> 35:23.225
Very romantic.

35:23.266 --> 35:23.606
Right?

35:23.686 --> 35:24.246
I know!

35:24.447 --> 35:27.009
Akihabara being Akihabara and everything.

35:27.049 --> 35:31.312
You wouldn't think that there'd be a view this romantic there, right?

35:31.352 --> 35:32.534
Mansei Baishi is nice.

35:34.207 --> 35:45.990
But you know, I hope that you had a bunch of fun in Akihabara and that maybe you weren't too surprised when everything closed up and it got dark at around 8pm.

35:47.131 --> 35:52.132
It always surprises us too, because Akihabara closes very early, right?

35:52.372 --> 35:56.233
And you know, you just want to have more fun in Akihabara, right?

35:56.273 --> 35:58.634
Too bad it closes rather early.

35:59.614 --> 36:00.815
Gotta be quick.

36:00.875 --> 36:01.996
Gotta be quick.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.738
BAU BAU!

36:04.758 --> 36:07.680
And next we have the question of the day!

36:07.700 --> 36:09.181
What question do we have today?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.002
De-den!

36:11.582 --> 36:13.083
Hi FUWAMOCO!

36:13.143 --> 36:14.144
Hello!

36:14.164 --> 36:18.407
Now that we are a few days in autumn... Moco-chan!

36:18.807 --> 36:21.869
Same as last time!

36:23.170 --> 36:26.412
This is not the question of today, this was the question of last time.

36:29.514 --> 36:31.580
What's the question of today?

36:35.647 --> 36:41.129
Hello FUWAMOCO!

36:41.209 --> 36:42.070
I have a question.

36:42.090 --> 36:48.192
Since I also have a twin brother myself, so I can't help but be curious.

36:48.632 --> 36:53.374
Do you two have experience about sharing one thing between each other by taking a twin?

36:53.754 --> 36:55.574
Do you two ever have a fight because of that?

36:56.034 --> 36:56.635
Thank you!

36:57.135 --> 36:58.275
Thank you for the question!

37:00.536 --> 37:03.178
Sharing is the name of our lives, I think.

37:03.518 --> 37:04.639
It's everything.

37:06.279 --> 37:08.101
So I think we're pretty good at it, right?

37:08.141 --> 37:09.982
Yeah, but sometimes we aren't!

37:10.262 --> 37:11.683
No, sometimes we aren't, yeah.

37:12.083 --> 37:21.368
But we do squabble about things here and there, but when we do it's always over-silly things like food or computer time or something like that.

37:22.769 --> 37:24.710
But most recently, it was the Switch.

37:25.050 --> 37:25.771
Yeah.

37:25.831 --> 37:27.532
Ruffians, you know, right?

37:28.072 --> 37:28.692
We know it!

37:29.073 --> 37:31.193
Some ruffians, because you saw us tweet, right?

37:32.054 --> 37:34.315
Ruffians just said, oh, get a second Switch!

37:35.015 --> 37:36.996
It's not easy, you can't do that!

37:37.036 --> 37:37.996
No, it's not just like that.

37:38.056 --> 37:38.897
You have to share!

37:38.917 --> 37:40.337
That's not how you do it, ruffians.

37:40.437 --> 37:44.139
We don't use the Switch enough to get two Switches, that's silly.

37:44.299 --> 37:47.340
But when we use the Switch, we both want to use the Switch at the same time!

37:47.360 --> 37:47.701
Exactly!

37:47.901 --> 37:49.441
So then we share it.

37:50.142 --> 37:53.363
One round of Suika game, other round of Suika game.

37:53.923 --> 37:54.284
Yeah.

37:54.364 --> 37:54.704
Yeah.

37:56.645 --> 38:01.188
But food, you know, that obviously needs to be very equal.

38:01.248 --> 38:05.892
So, you know, if Fuwawa has a more delicious mushroom in her soup, then I want that.

38:08.746 --> 38:09.787
It's a bit complicated.

38:09.907 --> 38:17.229
It's not that easy, but you know, we just remind ourselves that we'll be all equal out in the end.

38:17.889 --> 38:19.249
It's not a big deal, you know?

38:19.670 --> 38:22.070
Even though sometimes it might be really hard to do that.

38:23.011 --> 38:24.171
Just remember, you know?

38:24.471 --> 38:26.472
Ruffians, you know how to share too, though, right?

38:27.512 --> 38:27.973
You should.

38:28.953 --> 38:31.756
It's a very important skill, okay?

38:31.796 --> 38:31.996
Right?

38:32.036 --> 38:34.498
But just keep on remembering, you know?

38:34.558 --> 38:36.180
Sharing, you know?

38:36.740 --> 38:37.281
It's important.

38:37.781 --> 38:38.322
It's important.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.443
It's not worth creating your bond over that, so.

38:40.463 --> 38:40.624
Yeah.

38:45.988 --> 38:46.949
BAU BAU!

38:47.029 --> 38:48.430
Thank you for the question!

38:48.450 --> 38:50.152
FUWAMOCO-chan.

38:50.192 --> 38:54.075
You sure took a long time eating natto, so... Let's go fast here!

38:54.095 --> 38:55.676
Our next theme!

38:56.337 --> 39:00.160
Today we're going to be focusing on some homework and recording.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.481
Going very, very hard on those.

39:02.542 --> 39:06.224
But we'll be back tomorrow with... De-den!

39:06.525 --> 39:07.746
Parasol Show!

39:08.066 --> 39:09.027
Parasol Show!

39:09.327 --> 39:11.289
Not the closing shit, Parasol Show!

39:11.609 --> 39:12.289
Yes!

39:12.570 --> 39:14.972
It's another very popular game from Chiyo's life.

39:15.652 --> 39:18.694
Who made the closing shift that's why it's like this.

39:18.794 --> 39:20.536
And we played it a few weeks ago.

39:20.556 --> 39:23.338
I don't know, you know.

39:23.698 --> 39:27.261
I feel like the closing shift wasn't all that too scary.

39:27.501 --> 39:28.282
We made drinks.

39:28.302 --> 39:29.042
I like that.

39:29.262 --> 39:31.124
So we should be okay this time, right?

39:32.104 --> 39:34.466
Ruffians, I don't know.

39:34.887 --> 39:38.529
We might not need you to hold our paw this time.

39:38.669 --> 39:38.990
Maybe.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.391
I think maybe we'll be okay.

39:41.392 --> 39:44.155
But please be there for us, okay?

39:44.195 --> 39:47.459
We'll show you that we're strong, guys.

39:47.499 --> 39:48.660
Thumbnail TV-8.

39:49.862 --> 39:51.243
BAU BAU!

39:51.444 --> 39:54.147
And take another look at our schedule.

39:54.207 --> 39:55.889
De-den!

39:56.350 --> 39:59.914
Well, on Wednesday we're gonna be starting the morning with

40:00.888 --> 40:01.788
FUWAMOCO Morning.

40:02.008 --> 40:02.428
But!

40:02.828 --> 40:04.829
It's not just FUWAMOCO Morning.

40:04.849 --> 40:07.989
We're gonna be streaming three times a day!

40:08.029 --> 40:09.070
Three times!

40:09.110 --> 40:18.952
We're sharing our morning together, and then in the afternoon, we're gonna be joining some of our Holo EN Senpai and Advent members together in Party Animals!

40:19.212 --> 40:20.012
I'm excited!

40:20.292 --> 40:22.532
Yeah, we're gonna be battling it out there together.

40:22.572 --> 40:24.213
It's our first time playing that game too, right?

40:24.233 --> 40:27.253
Yeah, we don't know who's gonna be joining, so it's a surprise.

40:27.273 --> 40:28.094
It's a surprise.

40:29.274 --> 40:29.634
And then,

40:30.074 --> 40:34.016
We're gonna be starting out in Resident Evil 4 Remake.

40:34.136 --> 40:40.680
You know, morning, afternoon in the middle, and night!

40:40.760 --> 40:41.920
Three times!

40:42.120 --> 40:42.380
Right?

40:42.481 --> 40:46.903
It'll definitely be a very fun day, but a busy one.

40:46.943 --> 40:51.565
So Ruffians, we hope that you'll be able to share your day, some of your time.

40:51.966 --> 40:53.166
You'll be there for us too.

40:53.186 --> 40:58.249
It's gonna be very fun, so... BAU BAU!

40:59.366 --> 41:03.109
Thank you ruffians for joining us today!

41:03.469 --> 41:09.534
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special ruffians today!

41:09.554 --> 41:10.094

41:10.114 --> 41:10.895

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

41:49.573 --> 41:51.495
