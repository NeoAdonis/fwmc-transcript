## Pero Sighting (06:39)

[@Ztynz1](https://twitter.com/Ztynz1/status/1719572335747797367) found Pero in the gym and it seems that he does, in fact, lift. FUWAMOCO encourage Ruffians not to wait until next year and make November a month for getting in good shape!

Haachama](https://www.youtube.com/@AkaiHaato) returns with [a chit-chat stream](https://youtu.be/q6KktlRYeuI) where she shares the reasons behind her absence and demyths some of the fan theories around that. FUWAMOCO share how they felt about the return of her senpai along with their first impressions of her.

## Dog Day (13:43)

Japan celebrates Dog Day ([犬の日, 'Inu no hi'](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%8A%AC%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5)) today! It originates from a word play on how the 'one's on the date sound like barks. FUWAMOCO expects Ruffians to celebrate it by petting any dog they find and BAU BAUing out loud.

## Confession (15:23)

FUWAMOCO confessed that they didn't have any candy this Halloween. The sisters warn Ruffians not to overindulge on sweets now that they might be on sale.

## Misunderstandings (17:45)

No misunderstandings to start the month on the right paw! FUWAMOCO aim to have a "No Misunderstandings November"; Ruffians are doubtful about that...

## Rawr n' Response (19:10)

As it's tradition, FUWAMOCO will be hosting another Rawr n' Response on Twitter! Later in the day they will post a tweet and Ruffians can reply to it with the hashtag \#FUWAMOCO for a chance of getting a response from the lovely sisters. Good luck! 2023-11-01T19:00Z

## Today I Went On A Walk (26:50)

 A sidewalk covered by a golden carpet made out of leaves: that's what [Ken](https://twitter.com/chef17/status/1719098415596929396) found while going on a walk along the streets of New York.

## Question Of The Day (27:40)

[Nae Yurimiya](https://twitter.com/yurimiyanae/status/1716191380580839841) asks FUWAMOCO if there's ever been a story that made them change their outlook on life. The twin sister shared that they were influenced by many of the Visual Novels they've read, as well as by the stories and interviews from other creators. It seems that Mama puppy and Papa puppy have also been a big influence in their way of being.
