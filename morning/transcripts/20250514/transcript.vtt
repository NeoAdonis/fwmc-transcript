00:05:12.168 --> 00:05:18.806
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:22.195
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:27.943
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:31.467
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:34.570
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.252
BAU BAU!

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:41.078
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.324
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for our 157th episode!

00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:49.347
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:51.449
That's a lot of mornings now.

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:55.734
Have any more too.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:06:05.264
But for Ruffians joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:07.086
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:10.409
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.895
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:18.017
So, please,

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:19.579
Please, Moco-chan, please!

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.861
Tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:22.662 --> 00:06:24.984
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:29.168
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.511
BAU BAU!

00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:33.192
Speedy intro today!

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:37.036
We just wanna get you the info, Ruffians!

00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:41.661
We're here to wake you up and get you up for the day.

00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:41.901
Right!

00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:42.222
Right!

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:43.823
We're just gonna pull those sheets off.

00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:47.667
Time to get up and kick you up the morning!

00:06:47.647 --> 00:06:49.889
Just the facts, yes.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.652
Important info, yes.

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:55.394
Yeah, it's supposed to be short format after all, huh?

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:55.514
Yeah.

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.337
BAU BAU!

00:06:58.357 --> 00:06:59.378
I am finally good!

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.680
Well, let's keep it that way, huh?

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:03.602
Yeah!

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:05.924
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.304 --> 00:07:06.465
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:08.366
Well, it's Wednesday, Moco-chan.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.468
What do you have for the wolfies today?

00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:13.952
Another Pero?

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:15.553
Why, no.

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:17.535
Can we just not?

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:24.742
Let's see!

00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:32.293
Where do we see Pero this time?

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:33.054
De-den!

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.350
Wow!

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:47.664
I don't know what to say.

00:07:47.704 --> 00:07:51.611
You know, usually, safety reasons, Ruffians, you know.

00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:54.776
Self-defense, you know.

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:59.243
Poke the balloon, those kind of things, but... Well, you know, Pero?

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:01.547
Pero looks really chill here, right?

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:02.669
Comfy, huh?

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:03.350
Right.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.091
I don't know.

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:08.559
Kind of makes me want to go out and enjoy the summer, too.

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:09.941
Right.

00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:11.704
What about you, Ruffians?

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:25.457
Ruffians, are you already in summer mode now?

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.681
Yeah?

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:27.061
Yeah.

00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:28.804
You want to swim?

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:29.605
You want to swim?

00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:31.047
Doggy paddle, right?

00:08:31.087 --> 00:08:32.128
Yes, doggy paddle.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.712
That's his pool now.

00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:35.913
Well, you know.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:36.815
I'll deny that.

00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.056
He has his glasses on.

00:08:38.377 --> 00:08:39.799
He looks kind of sleepy.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.545
Maybe you could just kind of go in there and splash quite quietly to yourself in the corner.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:45.747
You're still in spring mode.

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:48.170
You miss winter?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.517
Well, winter's just right around the corner once you get to the summer time and the fall time, right?

00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:55.039
You know.

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:56.080
He's alright.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.081
I'm still awake somewhere.

00:08:57.101 --> 00:09:02.808
I haven't seen Pero swim before.

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:05.491
Ruffians, do you think Pero can swim?

00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:10.937
Push him under the water then.

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:12.138
What do you think?

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:18.305
I feel like his little wings could go bop bop bop bop, but I don't think... He's pure muscle, right?

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:22.950
I think if he was to swim on his side, he'd kind of be like a shark.

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:26.475
Pure muscle.

00:09:27.055 --> 00:09:27.516
Sink.

00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:28.116
Right.

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:30.178
Float.

00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:32.240
I think you sound right, Moco-chan.

00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:34.823
Well, we haven't tried, but... Muscles!

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:35.804
You don't have to float!

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:37.425
Pero looks so comfy here.

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:38.506
We're not gonna do anything.

00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:39.567
We'll just leave him be.

00:09:39.587 --> 00:09:42.430
You know, I just... I feel bad looking at this.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.911
I know it'll happen.

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:45.433
Something will happen.

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:46.073
I just know it.

00:09:47.655 --> 00:09:47.755
Yeah.

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:50.938
Moco-chan, do you feel like you're looking forward to the summertime a bit more now?

00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:52.279
Well...

00:09:53.272 --> 00:10:08.669
We're starting to get all the heat, but... Maybe I'll still be fine, huh?

00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:08.849
Excited!

00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:08.970
Yeah!

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.250
How you know?

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.711
All Hawaii shaved ice!

00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:10.453
We'll party together the whole year!

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:17.117
Those things sound fun too!

00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:19.542
Let's look forward to the summer!

00:10:19.562 --> 00:10:22.166
Yeah, and the cicadas.

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.950
BAU BAU!

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.616
Thanks for Pero, you know, teaching us the important things.

00:10:28.598 --> 00:10:30.000
BAU BAU!

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.401
We'll enjoy summer.

00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:32.104
Yeah, you know.

00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:34.609
This is not all hot and sweat.

00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.492
Let's hope Pero brings back holo-summer.

00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:44.993
BAU BAU!

00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:46.295
Speaking of the summer.

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:53.884
Yeah, and speaking of things that you know we've all been waiting for for a long time!

00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:55.486
We've been looking forward to!

00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:56.308
So so much!

00:10:56.328 --> 00:11:00.052
Early on the hololive official English channel!

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:03.957
Bae-senpai, IRyS-senpai, and Biboo!

00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:09.364
They had a 3D livestream with some breaking news!

00:11:09.344 --> 00:11:16.660
I heard things got pretty silly, but more importantly, it's finally here!

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:23.775
hololive English's second concert, "Breaking Dimensions," is now on Blu-ray!

00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:25.400
Yes!

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.324
Finally!

00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:28.525
Exciting!

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:29.106
Finally, finally!

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:29.947
Another second concert!

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:33.032
It happened in New York City last year!

00:11:33.272 --> 00:11:34.695
Can you believe it?

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:38.020
Now it's so long ago, but it doesn't feel like it.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:49.999
It doesn't feel like it, but... But on this Blu-ray disc, you can find both Day 1 and Day 2 of live performances from all of hololive English.

00:11:50.907 --> 00:11:53.750
Very, very important snapshot back into 2024.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.053
I can't believe it's been so long.

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:57.395
What took so long?

00:11:57.935 --> 00:11:59.377
It's not a given!

00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:01.359
You know!

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:03.802
Please, please, please, please, please, please!

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:04.263
We've been asking too!

00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:05.284
Blue Ray, Blue Ray, Blue Ray, Blue Ray!

00:12:05.304 --> 00:12:06.005
Please!

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:06.205
Yeah.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:11.811
They didn't, they didn't get us a DVD version.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:11.972
VHS!

00:12:12.993 --> 00:12:14.875
I wanted a DVD version!

00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:19.260
Imagine you made a VHS version and you brought it back in the past.

00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:32.514
You know, for FUWAMOCO, it's really really important because it was my first time performing on the big stage together with our senpai.

00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:33.696
In New York too!

00:12:33.716 --> 00:12:37.061
Yeah, it really meant a lot to us, you know.

00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:41.247
Performing Purupururiri with Biboo and Abe-senpai.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:46.134
You know, seeing Bono-senpai stay with me in the middle of the night.

00:12:46.314 --> 00:12:49.078
Mumei-senpai's a new star!

00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:53.188
You know, being able to see all of us singing Reunion together.

00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:55.354
There's always that one part where I get so teary.

00:12:55.394 --> 00:12:56.376
Right.

00:12:56.617 --> 00:13:00.366
I don't know, Reunion was always a really good song, but after that performance.

00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:01.790
The choreography is just so good.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.637
You know, Reunion's a really special song.

00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:16.945
They're all performances that we'll never ever forget, but with this blu-ray disc, now we can relive it as many times as we want.

00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:25.413
But, Ruffians, you can get it on the official hololive shop, but it's available on pre-order until June 5th, about one month.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:30.698
So, we really recommend pre-ordering yours now before you forget!

00:13:30.718 --> 00:13:31.458
We will!

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.240
We are going to, yes!

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:42.204
Because FUWAMOCO we have the experience of getting to order Connect the World's Blu-ray of our first concert.

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:45.513
Who here has Connect the World's Blu-ray?

00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:48.681
Can you give it to us?

00:13:51.057 --> 00:13:55.064
Because we didn't get it and now we regret it forever.

00:13:55.164 --> 00:13:56.246
It's impossible to get.

00:13:56.767 --> 00:13:57.849
It's impossible.

00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:59.271
We have looked everywhere.

00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:00.934
We have asked for a long time.

00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:02.076
So many stuff is on.

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:02.657
No.

00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:02.737
No.

00:14:03.017 --> 00:14:03.739
Excuse me.

00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:07.104
Do you have any copies of Connect the World lying around?

00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:09.148
I mean, you know.

00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:09.508
Nope.

00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:10.049
Nope.

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.490
Nope.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:10.811
Nope.

00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:12.534
Can't give you one if they don't have one.

00:14:14.257 --> 00:14:14.517
Yeah.

00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:19.193
So Ruffians, we're waiting for a reprint of it, just like you.

00:14:19.413 --> 00:14:21.775
We are the biggest supporter.

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:25.038
Wanna do a Inao Connect World rerun?

00:14:25.058 --> 00:14:26.720
We'll ask again.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:31.564
So Ruffians, just make sure you don't repeat what we did.

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:34.707
Because it's very special.

00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:41.754
If you feel like you want to archive this special, special moment for hololive English, then now's the time, you know?

00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:43.255
Or you could ask Shiori.

00:14:45.766 --> 00:15:02.543
I don't know if that's gonna work out in the Ruffians' favors, but... You know, also Rikki dimensions, it was our first time performing our original song, Blame to be Balla, on stage, so... Hopefully you can see a bit of improvement, some changes and stuff.

00:15:02.523 --> 00:15:06.849
But we hope that you'll decide to get it, Ruffians!

00:15:06.869 --> 00:15:08.612
BAU BAU!

00:15:08.632 --> 00:15:11.716
Are you ready to start the day with a couple extra items?

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:14.340
BAU BAU!

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.686
Looks like it's gonna be lots of fun!

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:22.371
Sounds like there's some anticipation there.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.285
BAU BAU!

00:15:28.109 --> 00:15:29.473
Thank you Ruffians!

00:15:31.818 --> 00:15:32.019
Thank you!

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:33.462
We have some more news!

00:15:33.482 --> 00:15:34.745
Talking about New York!

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:35.547
New York!

00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:36.930
Kinda close to New York.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.033
Is it close to New York?

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:39.356
I think it's close to New York.

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:41.862
Ruffians let us know if it's close to New York!

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:47.150
FUWAMOCO unofficial world tour continues!

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.396
New year, new unofficial world tour!

00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:55.723
New York is next in the polls!

00:15:56.724 --> 00:16:01.451
We're going to Boston!

00:16:01.992 --> 00:16:02.753
Boston!

00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:04.736
BALLISTIN!

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.058
Yes!

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:10.245
We're going to be a ballistin for the whole week!

00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:11.908
Super Kyle can finally ballistin!

00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:12.709
Yeah!

00:16:12.729 --> 00:16:17.957
Together we'll be there at the base!

00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:18.158
Yeah!

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:18.258
Fun!

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:25.129
We're really really excited, you know, and a little bit nervous because this time we'll be dancing around and singing and dancing!

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:52.095
Moco-chan, what do you think of the set list?

00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:55.843
I think you'll be excited, but it's a bit different, I feel.

00:16:55.863 --> 00:16:56.985
Maybe it was a bit different.

00:16:57.026 --> 00:16:57.807
Is it still a bit different?

00:16:57.887 --> 00:16:58.308
I don't know.

00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:02.157
We thought really, really hard about it.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:03.159
Really, really hard.

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:06.386
We have, you know, some classic hololive songs.

00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:08.069
Classic anime songs.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.314
Classic songs overall.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:11.316
Right.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:13.598
So you'll definitely want to be there.

00:17:13.618 --> 00:17:15.159
I think it's better than we haven't sung before.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.780
We haven't, we haven't.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.461
No, no.

00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:19.844
It's a good thing it's kind of an embarrassing song.

00:17:22.446 --> 00:17:24.868
But we have a very fun setlist prepared.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.233
So Ruffians, we hope that you'll jam out together with us!

00:17:30.253 --> 00:17:36.158
And most importantly and all, don't forget your pen lights and your big bobo's and probably the blanket too.

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:36.399
Okay!

00:17:36.439 --> 00:17:40.122
I'm excited but nervous, excited but nervous.

00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:43.058
Always the case, Moco-chan.

00:17:44.723 --> 00:17:50.261
But we'll do our best there, so we hope to see you on May 24th in Boston!

00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.993
BAU BAU!

00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:56.362
Anime Baustan.

00:17:56.422 --> 00:17:59.345
What would Bae-senpai be doing?

00:17:59.365 --> 00:17:59.886
Oh right.

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:02.328
Probably something different from us.

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:04.410
We did suggest some songs.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.793
But then, I think... Oh no, we didn't steal them.

00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:07.233
It's okay.

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:11.357
BAU BAU!

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:12.478
Yeah.

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:12.758
Yeah.

00:18:12.778 --> 00:18:13.719
Bae-sen!

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:14.600
Baustan!

00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:16.122
It both works.

00:18:16.142 --> 00:18:16.762
Both works.

00:18:16.923 --> 00:18:17.123
It's good.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:18.544
Anime Baustan.

00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:22.028
Anime Baustan.

00:18:22.428 --> 00:18:22.528
Yeah!

00:18:22.508 --> 00:18:31.820
But you know, not just Anime Boston.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.387
There's gonna be another very exciting hololive related event coming up shortly.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:40.270
Yeah, and we thought we would share it!

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.952
On... what month is it?

00:18:41.972 --> 00:18:43.234
ME!

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:45.744
I'm being so reticed!

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:52.873
In Tokyo, there's gonna be a hololive fan event called "Holokle" happening!

00:18:52.893 --> 00:18:53.093
Holokle!

00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:55.456
It's made by a whole bunch of hololisters.

00:18:55.476 --> 00:18:56.917
It's a doujin event.

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:59.300
I don't know if it's a fan doujin.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.540
Fan event!

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.002
Fan event, yeah.

00:19:01.022 --> 00:19:03.505
Run by other hololive fans.

00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:06.408
And this is actually the ninth time.

00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:06.969
Right.

00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:08.691
And look at FUWAMOCO!

00:19:08.711 --> 00:19:09.031
We're out there!

00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:09.492
We're out there on the

00:19:10.332 --> 00:19:17.839
Drawn by Ayamy-sensei!

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:19.961
So cute!

00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:20.441
Thank you Ayamy-sensei!

00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:21.342
We were excited to see on Twitter, you know?

00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:22.103
So cute!

00:19:22.123 --> 00:19:28.068
But you know, FUWAMOCO, we really really like you know, doujin works, fan works.

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:32.332
Yeah, but in case you're not really certain, these sort of events, there's a bunch of fun things going on.

00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:35.254
But mainly there's a lot of unofficial fan works.

00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:35.935
Books!

00:19:36.235 --> 00:19:39.158
You know, doujin shi, any sort of fan works.

00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:42.582
From a lot of different circles, all fans, you know.

00:19:43.022 --> 00:19:47.848
And this time also including Icomochi-mama!

00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:50.030
Icomochi-mama will be there too!

00:19:50.291 --> 00:19:50.651
And Ayamy-sensei!

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:56.137
We're just so excited and really really happy to see so many circles, hololive.

00:19:56.157 --> 00:20:01.023
We always really want to support doujinshi events, you know, fan events and everything like that.

00:20:02.064 --> 00:20:05.628
We hope that we can get our paws on everyone's legs somehow.

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:07.990
Thank you!

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.571
I know us.

00:20:08.888 --> 00:20:13.032
In the past, we talked about taking, you know, a photo of our treasures.

00:20:14.053 --> 00:20:19.439
I don't know if it's gonna fit in a photo anymore, Ruffians.

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:21.261
We did attempt it.

00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:22.782
We did attempt it, we did.

00:20:22.802 --> 00:20:28.468
But... It would've taken a... We were struggling!

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:29.930
Probably twice over.

00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:32.252
Multiple photos then!

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:34.014
That's a lot of photos.

00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:35.976
Yeah, I think, yeah.

00:20:37.017 --> 00:20:38.018
Is it that much?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.270
Lots of treasures.

00:20:42.795 --> 00:20:45.358
Lots of treasures!

00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:48.892
Thank you for your time!

00:20:48.912 --> 00:20:52.256
Thank you so much to all the sequels.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.759
You're creating wonderful works.

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:56.781
You know there's also Komike as well.

00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:59.924
Komike is coming up in the summertime.

00:20:59.964 --> 00:21:02.227
We'll be looking forward to that.

00:21:02.247 --> 00:21:04.169
Please, please keep on creating.

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:07.632
Creating the things that you want to make with all your heart.

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:12.738
Yeah, we're always here to support you, okay?

00:21:12.758 --> 00:21:12.958
Thank you!

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:13.419
Thank you!

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:13.759
BAU BAU!

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:14.901
Mane-chan, ganbare!

00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:15.982
Ya!

00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:22.411
You know, Mane-chan's list keeps on getting bigger and bigger by the end.

00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.032
BAU BAU!

00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:28.559
BAU BAU!

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.023
Wow, Ruffians.

00:21:31.283 --> 00:21:32.505
Do you remember?

00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:34.207
The other day?

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:35.709
On Monday.

00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:37.592
Monday FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:41.637
Kinda started off on a bit of a wrong paw.

00:21:43.152 --> 00:21:45.814
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:50.479
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.142
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:54.162 --> 00:21:54.502
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.343
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:56.084 --> 00:21:57.065
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:57.145 --> 00:21:58.065
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:58.085 --> 00:21:59.267
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:59.287 --> 00:21:59.747
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:00.568
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:00.648 --> 00:22:01.148
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:01.228 --> 00:22:02.049
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:02.069 --> 00:22:02.409
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:03.070
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.610
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:04.091
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:04.131 --> 00:22:05.072
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:05.812
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:05.832 --> 00:22:06.313
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:06.813
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:06.873 --> 00:22:07.554
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:07.574 --> 00:22:07.934
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:08.295
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:08.715
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:09.316
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:09.796
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:10.276
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:10.297 --> 00:22:11.978
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:12.959
Why?

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.581
I've never heard that.

00:22:14.601 --> 00:22:15.523
Not the meatballs!

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:16.524
It wasn't the meatballs!

00:22:17.706 --> 00:22:22.915
But Ruffians, I guess they continue, they continue.

00:22:22.935 --> 00:22:28.364
You know, that same day, we went to the grocery store and got some groceries.

00:22:28.824 --> 00:22:30.527
More natto!

00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:39.822
And our total, it came up to 4,444 yen.

00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:45.337
What do you do?

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:45.857
What do you do?

00:22:46.037 --> 00:22:47.979
That's a very ominous number in Japan.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:48.800
What do you do when that happens?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.942
Because boy can also read like that.

00:22:52.643 --> 00:22:53.805
What do you do when that happens?

00:22:53.825 --> 00:22:54.765
What are you supposed to do?

00:22:54.825 --> 00:23:03.454
Are you supposed to do something because she'd be like, excuse me, um, I can't, I can't pay this, uh, can I, can I just grab a candy or something?

00:23:06.296 --> 00:23:12.542
But it was already, it was already all done and they're like, please go pay and... Yeah.

00:23:13.552 --> 00:23:15.716
You don't pay!

00:23:15.736 --> 00:23:16.397
At that point you just don't pay!

00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:17.519
Call Calli-senpai!

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:19.402
Demand an explanation!

00:23:19.422 --> 00:23:19.722
I think I will!

00:23:19.742 --> 00:23:20.604
I think I will!

00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:21.405
I think that sounds like a good idea!

00:23:21.425 --> 00:23:22.207
I think that!

00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:22.447
You don't!

00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:27.996
Because what's even worse is nothing particularly bad happened that day.

00:23:28.017 --> 00:23:28.898
But when does it end?

00:23:29.459 --> 00:23:30.721
When's it gonna happen, you know?

00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:32.604
I don't know what to do, Ruffians!

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:36.751
Is this something that, you know, pon-de-rings can solve?

00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:38.935
Headpods can fix it?

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.220
What?

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.061
What do we do now?

00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:46.207
But it's funny though because in the middle of Gears Solid 3 we have our save data, right?

00:23:46.227 --> 00:23:55.521
2025 05 05 00 11 11 10 Yeah.

00:23:55.541 --> 00:23:55.981
I don't know.

00:23:56.662 --> 00:23:59.827
If it had been 4 4 4 4, would we have been unhappy?

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.172
I would be scared.

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.053
I would be scared.

00:24:04.253 --> 00:24:05.355
But we keep the save, right?

00:24:05.976 --> 00:24:06.897
Haunted save.

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:11.745
Wearing swimsuits is not the answer to everything, Ruffians!

00:24:11.765 --> 00:24:14.008
Swimsuits is not the answer to everything, okay?

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.071
BAU BAU.

00:24:16.091 --> 00:24:17.874
Maybe we'll call the Calli-senpai.

00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:18.895
Shiawase no.

00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:19.356
Shie.

00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:21.258
Shie.

00:24:21.278 --> 00:24:22.240
I won't have pants.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.381
I'm pondering.

00:24:23.682 --> 00:24:24.923
Okay, Ruffians.

00:24:25.204 --> 00:24:26.445
I'm gonna ask Calli-senpai.

00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:28.328
She'll maybe show her advice.

00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:35.013
I don't think we're particularly suspicious.

00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:39.019
Superstitious.

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:41.663
We're a little bit suspicious.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.216
Hopefully nothing bad happens.

00:24:51.236 --> 00:24:53.860
BAU BAU!

00:24:55.882 --> 00:25:00.966
Well, Ruffians, we've already talked about the new exciting blog breaking the legends.

00:25:01.447 --> 00:25:04.029
But there's also exciting stuff in case you missed it.

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:13.838
Yeah, as you might know, right now we're celebrating our 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:25:13.858 --> 00:25:14.798
We are 1 million!

00:25:14.818 --> 00:25:21.664
On FUWAMOCO, we have a very deluxe set of merchandise that we carefully produced ourselves.

00:25:21.684 --> 00:25:22.965
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:23.346 --> 00:25:25.888
With these old paws.

00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:30.401
And here we take a look at our Moco-chan.

00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:37.039
Well you can see here, Icomochi-mama and Mama!

00:25:38.423 --> 00:25:40.047
She's done the illustration for it there!

00:25:40.067 --> 00:25:40.228
BAU BAU!

00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:40.729
Thank you Icomochi-mama!

00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:41.110
I'm so so lucky!

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:46.396
Well first we have a Dreams Come True Acrylic Diorama Stand!

00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:46.496
Yes!

00:25:46.737 --> 00:25:49.460
And see you know, this is the first!

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:49.760
The first!

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.546
The first Diorama Stand Acrylic Stand of FUWAMOCO us together!

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:55.227
The first one!

00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:55.707
The first one ever!

00:25:55.727 --> 00:25:56.628
And Ruffians!

00:25:56.648 --> 00:25:58.511
Today you are with us to make us petal too!

00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:03.456
You know, so it's extra special and must have in the collection!

00:26:04.638 --> 00:26:07.121
And you already have a sponsor for it!

00:26:07.141 --> 00:26:07.401

00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:10.066
We're really looking forward to it too, you know.

00:26:10.126 --> 00:26:13.011
We wanted to be a very special acrylic diorama.

00:26:13.031 --> 00:26:13.752
You know.

00:26:13.952 --> 00:26:17.338
Why is it taking so long to get here, you know?

00:26:17.358 --> 00:26:18.400
We've all been waiting.

00:26:22.427 --> 00:26:22.707

00:26:22.687 --> 00:26:26.494
Ruffians, you remember on the day we debuted, I pledged.

00:26:26.574 --> 00:26:27.295
I pledged.

00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:28.117
I pledged of loyalty.

00:26:28.137 --> 00:26:29.519
You haven't forgotten, right?

00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:31.463
To protect you smile, Ruffians.

00:26:31.483 --> 00:26:31.924
From us to you.

00:26:32.645 --> 00:26:33.126
And here.

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:34.268
You can get it.

00:26:34.288 --> 00:26:35.470
You can have that.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.556
I pledged forever and ever.

00:26:38.576 --> 00:26:43.665
And you know that way, maybe on days that are a little rough, you can take a look at it and be like,

00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:17.444
I've heard some rumors that if you order four, then sometimes you get all four.

00:27:17.464 --> 00:27:18.766
It's a rumor!

00:27:18.786 --> 00:27:19.246
I haven't tested it.

00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:19.787
It's not tested.

00:27:19.807 --> 00:27:21.069
It's quite a rumor.

00:27:21.589 --> 00:27:22.971
So, you know... Gotcha.

00:27:23.051 --> 00:27:23.191
Gotcha.

00:27:23.211 --> 00:27:25.254
But I mean, if you get all four Mococos, is that a problem?

00:27:25.714 --> 00:27:26.735
That's not a problem, right?

00:27:26.755 --> 00:27:27.636
Ruffians, that's not a problem, right?

00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:39.150
If you pull all four Mococos, are you gonna be like... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Of course not!

00:27:41.413 --> 00:27:42.517
Of course not.

00:27:43.902 --> 00:27:44.183

Maybe a little less than that to be able to pre-order it.

00:30:08.766 --> 00:30:09.627
Is that what you want to do?

00:30:09.647 --> 00:30:10.368
The Doggie of the Day?

00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:11.369
Right?

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:14.113
The Doggie of the Day always makes the day happier, right?

What's this Pup Talk?

00:30:38.242 --> 00:30:40.084
Ruffians are talking about- Where's the Pup Talk?!

00:30:40.064 --> 00:30:40.084

00:30:41.617 --> 00:30:43.040
Hi.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.648
Moco-chan, maybe you have some encouraging words for us.

00:30:49.835 --> 00:30:50.116

00:31:05.162 --> 00:31:07.986
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:31:08.807 --> 00:31:12.191
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:31:14.694 --> 00:31:15.235
Ruffians!

00:31:16.837 --> 00:31:24.327
You know, in the past, how we've had wake-up style Pup Talks, right?

00:31:24.347 --> 00:31:24.787
Right!

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.393
Well, this year,

00:31:31.685 --> 00:31:33.748
This here is a sleepy style!

00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:36.892
Sleepy sleep style pup talk!

00:31:40.716 --> 00:31:42.819
Are you sleepy?

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:51.049
Do you think that... maybe... today was Monday?

00:31:51.069 --> 00:31:54.994
Are you a bit out of it?

00:31:55.014 --> 00:31:59.079
Do you need... an extra five minutes?

00:31:59.099 --> 00:31:59.159
No?

00:31:59.179 --> 00:31:59.340
No?

00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:01.202
Well...

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:11.496
You've been doing your best, but sometimes, you know, it's just time to give yourself a little bit more leniency, a little bit more kindness.

00:32:12.277 --> 00:32:16.602
So, we're gonna take a small nap together!

00:32:18.364 --> 00:32:21.146
That was a really loud announcement.

00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:23.108

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.530

00:32:33.654 --> 00:32:34.996

00:32:36.797 --> 00:32:40.061
Very, very, very comfy.

00:32:42.263 --> 00:32:44.805
You're already sleepy beforehand, so let's cover it.

00:32:45.606 --> 00:32:46.987
No more getting sleepy.

00:32:48.128 --> 00:32:52.833
Now, close your eyes.

00:32:52.993 --> 00:32:54.875
Very, very slowly.

00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:58.138
Slowly.

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:06.297
And deep breaths.

00:33:32.982 --> 00:33:36.146
Well, how was it?

00:33:38.749 --> 00:33:41.592
How was the nap?

Yeah?

00:33:46.918 --> 00:33:51.183
Well, let's all do our best in the last bit of the week until Friday, okay?

00:33:52.184 --> 00:33:53.286
Rested, yes, good.

00:33:54.547 --> 00:33:57.510

00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:30.939
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:34:30.959 --> 00:34:31.560
It's Biscuit!

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:31.841
Biscuit!

00:34:32.602 --> 00:34:33.684
Wow, what a rink.

00:34:33.804 --> 00:34:34.185
What?

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.448
Look at the rink.

00:34:35.468 --> 00:34:35.748
Super suave.

00:34:35.768 --> 00:34:36.289
Can I like this?

00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:37.852
Does it look good?

00:34:37.872 --> 00:34:38.473
Let's see Moco-chan.

00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:39.716
Oh!

00:34:39.736 --> 00:34:39.996
Oh!

00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:45.534
I would say it's biscuit-esque.

00:34:46.115 --> 00:34:47.076
Oh, that was good.

00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:50.701
BAU BAU!

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.627
But, but, but, look!

00:34:54.767 --> 00:34:58.812
Look at Biscuit's mum on arm!

00:34:58.832 --> 00:34:59.413
It's so cute!

00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:01.336
Cute!

00:35:01.356 --> 00:35:02.057
It's cute!

00:35:02.077 --> 00:35:04.380
The longer I look at it, the cuter it gets.

00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:08.694
Moco-chan, you're so tired.

00:35:09.115 --> 00:35:10.417
Oh, wink biscuit.

00:35:10.517 --> 00:35:11.299
Wink!

00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:12.141
I don't think you can.

00:35:14.485 --> 00:35:14.585
Wink!

00:35:14.605 --> 00:35:17.030
How does biscuit bow bow, Moco-chan?

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:28.753
I think it'll be sort of like... You know biscuit's pretty soft, maybe like... BOW BOW.

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:28.933
BOW BOW.

00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:36.068
It's Biscuit!

00:35:36.088 --> 00:35:36.188
Yeah!

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.491
Why is he winking?

00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:42.356
I don't know if Hey Lady is that polite, Moco-chan.

00:35:43.157 --> 00:35:44.539
That was him being slob!

00:35:46.722 --> 00:35:47.503
Hey Lady.

00:35:47.983 --> 00:35:48.985
BAU BAU!

00:35:50.427 --> 00:35:50.687
It's Biscuit!

00:35:51.108 --> 00:35:52.750
Yes!

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:53.691
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:59.038
Actually, Biscuit is a much much more well-trained gentleman.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.892
Hi!

00:36:02.573 --> 00:36:09.703
But, you know Abyssgard, you can tell he have a biscuit is a super cute toasted potato baby boy.

00:36:09.743 --> 00:36:11.546
Momo knows, Momo knows.

00:36:12.147 --> 00:36:12.267
Right.

00:36:12.828 --> 00:36:18.656
You know, and the fact that he's become your shadow is true prove just how much he loves you.

00:36:18.736 --> 00:36:20.318
You have a biscuit shadow.

00:36:21.732 --> 00:36:22.413
Delicious.

00:36:23.374 --> 00:36:29.501
But you know, also, it's pretty obvious, but the cuddles, the kisses, the winks, too.

00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.463
Those are all proof, too.

00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:33.966
BAU BAU!

00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:41.615
Thank you for making this FUWAMOCO channel, Biscuit!

00:36:41.635 --> 00:36:41.795
BAU BAU!

00:36:41.815 --> 00:36:42.536
BAU BAU!

00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:42.776
Thank you.

00:36:42.796 --> 00:36:45.779
Looks like egg, yeah!

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.742
It's not egg, it's biscuit.

00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.202
Biscuit.

00:36:48.523 --> 00:36:50.625
It's not egg, it's biscuit.

00:36:50.605 --> 00:36:52.670
BAU BAU!

00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:55.296
We're just gonna go on a walk right now.

00:36:55.316 --> 00:36:55.878
Moco-chan.

00:36:55.978 --> 00:36:57.181
Walk, okay!

00:36:57.201 --> 00:36:57.622
FUWAMOCO!

00:36:58.564 --> 00:36:58.965
Show us.

00:36:59.306 --> 00:37:00.509
Where did you go on a walk?

00:37:01.391 --> 00:37:03.376
We have de-den!

00:37:03.817 --> 00:37:05.982
What is this?

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:13.077
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:15.000
Have a howl of a day!

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.706
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:30.687
Have a howl of a day!

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:33.614
It's beautiful!

00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:36.240
We're really glad that you got out.

00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:40.149
A bit of a bike ride adventure despite the rain.

00:37:40.189 --> 00:37:42.895
You know sometimes the rain makes it even more fun, right?

00:37:42.915 --> 00:37:44.980
I bet you were a soggy doggy after all.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.684
Let's hope it was a soggy doggy.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:54.191
But as long as you have lots of fun, and it seems like you saw lots of different things and had a good time, so... That's important.

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.753
Cool car too.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:56.534
Good memories!

00:37:57.254 --> 00:37:59.316
BAU BAU!

00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:00.698
Thank you for sharing your walk with us!

00:38:01.138 --> 00:38:01.398
Thank you!

00:38:01.578 --> 00:38:06.303
And next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:38:06.703 --> 00:38:12.129
I'm curious what you both consider to be the ideal heroine in the VN's Vision novels you play.

00:38:12.529 --> 00:38:16.553
Do you save them for the last, or do you gun for them first?

00:38:16.533 --> 00:38:24.041
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:42.540
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:50.678
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:54.927
Have a howl of a day!

00:38:55.396 --> 00:39:03.188
You know, if there's one, your favorite girl, then I feel like saving her for last is best because you want her to be the true end, right?

00:39:03.649 --> 00:39:04.110
That's true.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.513
You want to end with the true end in your heart.

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:07.815
Well, this is not the true end, though.

00:39:08.056 --> 00:39:09.258
She's just a side hero here.

00:39:09.779 --> 00:39:11.101
You didn't even have an end, you cry.

00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:12.423
No, don't cry.

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:15.868
Yeah, or you write a bad review.

00:39:16.777 --> 00:39:26.933
No, no, but I think, you know, the most fun way is just to kind of go in blind, you know, be like, OK, I kind of like her.

00:39:26.953 --> 00:39:29.036
Maybe I'm going to try and aim for her ruler.

00:39:29.397 --> 00:39:32.081
But if it doesn't happen, well, we'll see where we go, you know?

00:39:32.502 --> 00:39:35.747
That's the most fun way to be able to just enjoy a visual novel.

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:38.191
Visual novels are life.

00:39:38.211 --> 00:39:39.493
I'll see where this goes.

00:39:39.473 --> 00:39:46.064
That's the number one way I think to go on the adventure.

00:39:46.444 --> 00:39:47.486
And if it ends up well, good.

00:39:47.807 --> 00:39:49.970
And if it doesn't end up well, well that's maybe part of the story.

00:39:51.152 --> 00:39:56.941
We should all go say FUWAMOCO!

00:39:56.962 --> 00:39:57.703
BAU BAU!

00:39:57.723 --> 00:40:00.067
Blind playthroughs are the best.

00:40:00.127 --> 00:40:02.090
You keep on dying and then that's better.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.013
A lot of people said that recently.

00:40:03.993 --> 00:40:05.155
BAU BAU.

00:40:05.195 --> 00:40:09.922
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:40:09.942 --> 00:40:15.691
We're always looking for more submissions from you because you know FUWAMOCO Morning, we're your hosts.

00:40:16.272 --> 00:40:18.456
FUWAMOCO, we're your hosts.

00:40:18.796 --> 00:40:22.542
But Ruffians, you're a very important part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:40:22.522 --> 00:40:25.550
So we're always waiting for your Pero sightings.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.196
Doggy of the days, your walks, I wanna see where you're going.

00:40:28.336 --> 00:40:29.880
And your questions too!

00:40:30.482 --> 00:40:32.026
So please let us know with the hashtag!

00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:35.234
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:40:36.838 --> 00:40:37.179
BAU BAU!

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.805
And our next team!

00:40:40.223 --> 00:40:44.149
Well, we have a schedule.

00:40:44.169 --> 00:40:47.074
Because our next stream is an Advent collab.

00:40:47.094 --> 00:40:53.084
We're going to be playing Jackbox Games on Biboo's channel on Thursday at 6pm PT.

00:40:53.104 --> 00:40:58.012
It's been quite a while, way too long since our last Advent collab.

00:40:58.032 --> 00:41:01.938
Which is good because Jackbox Games can get kind of crazy sometimes, right?

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.763
It is good.

00:41:05.452 --> 00:41:07.074
Be extra crazy.

00:41:07.194 --> 00:41:09.337
Not too sure what's gonna happen, yeah.

00:41:09.357 --> 00:41:12.380
We always love Advent Co-op.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:12.901
I know.

00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:18.768
It's a Jackbox game, so we'll see what happens.

00:41:18.788 --> 00:41:20.190
We hope that you join us in all of Advent Day.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:27.158
And otherwise, we have... On the weekend on Saturday at 6pm, we're gonna be starting Fatal Frame on PS2.

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.720
6pm or 5pm?

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.022
I can't remember.

00:41:30.042 --> 00:41:30.202
5pm.

00:41:30.282 --> 00:41:30.382
5pm!

00:41:30.402 --> 00:41:30.983
An hour earlier.

00:41:31.403 --> 00:41:31.864
Important.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.015
And you know the PS2 I think is doing pretty well.

00:41:36.055 --> 00:41:39.180
I wasn't complaining too much earlier with Metal Gear Solid 3.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.065
Especially when we forgot to turn it off after we finished playing.

00:41:42.085 --> 00:41:43.527
Yeah, it's off now.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:47.914
But you know Fatal Frame is a classic, a legendary horror game.

00:41:48.916 --> 00:41:52.020
And we're kinda not the best at horror games.

00:41:52.842 --> 00:41:54.144
Right, Ruffians?

00:41:54.164 --> 00:41:54.604
Are we getting better?

00:41:54.624 --> 00:41:55.686
I don't like mirrors.

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:57.128
I don't like windows.

00:41:57.148 --> 00:41:58.731
I don't like screens.

00:41:58.811 --> 00:42:00.113
I don't like cameras.

00:42:01.274 --> 00:42:04.416
You know FUWAMOCO is the perfect game if you don't like cameras, right?

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:12.145
We'll find out how it goes, but please be there to hold our paws while viewing!

00:42:12.165 --> 00:42:13.106
And in between we have a 2AM PT on Sunday.

00:42:13.126 --> 00:42:15.309
We're gonna be over on Ruri-senpai's channel for an Animal Tower Battle Tournament.

00:42:15.369 --> 00:42:18.594
It's a very simple but complicated game where we stack animals on top of each other to make a tower.

00:42:18.834 --> 00:42:19.195
Animal.

00:42:19.255 --> 00:42:19.395
Animal.

00:42:19.415 --> 00:42:19.575
Animal.

00:42:19.635 --> 00:42:19.795
Animal.

00:42:19.815 --> 00:42:19.976
Animal.

00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:20.136
Animal.

00:42:20.156 --> 00:42:20.296
Animal.

00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:20.456
Animal.

00:42:20.476 --> 00:42:20.617
Animal.

00:42:20.897 --> 00:42:21.117
Animal.

00:42:21.137 --> 00:42:21.297
Animal.

00:42:21.317 --> 00:42:21.458
Animal.

00:42:21.478 --> 00:42:21.678
Animal.

00:42:21.718 --> 00:42:21.858
Animal.

00:42:21.878 --> 00:42:22.018
Animal.

00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:22.199
Animal.

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:22.359
Animal.

00:42:22.379 --> 00:42:22.559
Animal.

00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:22.719
Animal.

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:22.880
Animal.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.040
Animal.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.200
Animal.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.360
Animal.

00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:24.021
Animal.

00:42:24.302 --> 00:42:24.442
Animal.

00:42:24.462 --> 00:42:24.662
Animal.

00:42:24.682 --> 00:42:24.822
Animal.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:25.023
Animal.

00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:25.183
Animal.

00:42:25.203 --> 00:42:25.343
Animal.

00:42:25.363 --> 00:42:25.523
Animal.

00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:25.684
Animal.

00:42:25.704 --> 00:42:25.844
Animal.

00:42:25.864 --> 00:42:26.024
Animal.

00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:26.184
Animal.

00:42:26.204 --> 00:42:26.345
Animal.

00:42:26.365 --> 00:42:26.505
Animal.

00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:26.845
Animal.

00:42:26.865 --> 00:42:27.066
Animal.

00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:27.867
Animal.

00:42:27.927 --> 00:42:28.067
Animal.

00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:28.247
Animal.

00:42:28.267 --> 00:42:28.407
Animal.

00:42:28.427 --> 00:42:28.568
Animal.

00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:29.088
Animal.

00:42:29.108 --> 00:42:29.249
Animal.

00:42:29.269 --> 00:42:29.429
Animal.

00:42:29.449 --> 00:42:29.589
Animal.

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:29.749
Animal.
