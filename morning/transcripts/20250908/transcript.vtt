00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:33.154
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:39.123
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:44.732
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:46.816
I'm Mococo!

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:49.922
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:51.686
BAU BAU!

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:56.896
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:57.076 --> 00:05:05.052
Thank you for joining us for our 170th episode today, Ruffians!

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.315
171!

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:06.535
BAU BAU!

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.437
BAU BAU!

00:05:08.457 --> 00:05:10.339
I feel like it's such happy numbers.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:10.999
171!

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.922
I don't know why, it reminds me of ice cream.

00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:15.123
Like 31.

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.287
It's 171 flavors, Moco-chan!

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:20.208
That'll be fun.

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.031
Just bite down, Moco-chan!

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:24.212
You're gonna pick one flavor, huh?

00:05:25.273 --> 00:05:26.154
And I'll stick to it!

00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:30.378
BAU BAU!

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.940
Double BGM!

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:34.142
Why?

00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:44.320
Is that better, Ruffians?

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:47.826
Is that better?

00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:50.952
No?

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:51.974
Yeah?

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.019
Yeah?

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:55.280
Okay!

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.143
We'll figure it out later then!

00:05:57.578 --> 00:06:00.023
BAU BAU!

00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:04.671
Now that that mischief's solved, Moco-chan!

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:07.557
Out of 107 flavors of ice cream, what are you gonna have, huh?

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:12.286
You're just gonna have one flavor, huh?

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:15.372
Yeah.

00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:16.594
Black licorice ice cream.

00:06:16.654 --> 00:06:18.658
Maybe?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.513
BAU BAU!

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:24.338
Ruffians, it's a brand new week!

00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:25.540
Thank you for joining us!

00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:36.377
And for Ruffians who are here for the very first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:38.840
A.K.A.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.461
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:42.906
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:49.034
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays, once a week.

00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:52.218
You know, so FUWAMOCO can get a bit more balanced in our lives!

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.206
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:58.706
Yeah!

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:01.470
Please take your de-

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.353

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:05.496
Please tweet your thoughts.

00:07:05.516 --> 00:07:07.439
Not your tweets, please tweet your tweets.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.502
With the hashtag!

00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:11.444
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.570
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.154
BAU BAU!

00:07:20.698 --> 00:07:23.822
Thank you Ruffians!

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:24.403

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:41.269
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:41.890
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.053
There's some technical issues today, huh?

00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:45.596
A bit.

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:50.282
Well, that's what happens sometimes when you wake up on a Monday morning, huh?

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:52.646
Technical issues.

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.929
BAU BAU!

00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.251
BAU BAU!

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:59.376
Well, Moco-chan, let's get started with the week, shall we?

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:03.229
More technical issues.

00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:03.709
Huh?

00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:04.510
What do you mean?

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:05.632
Huh?

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:08.235
BAU BAU!

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:13.723
Well... Technically more issues, you know.

00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:14.123
Huh?

00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:20.993
Cuz... There's been another Pero sighting!

00:09:23.216 --> 00:09:24.738
Where was he sitting now, Moco-chan?

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:26.460
Let's take a look.

00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:27.856
Okay.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.020
De-den!

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:32.382
Huh?

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:33.884
Uh, hi!

00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:34.224
Hi.

00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:35.306
Ludicrous?

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:35.446
Oh!

00:09:36.087 --> 00:09:39.190
Looks like there's some nasty came across your shirt.

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.333
Hi.

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:43.696
Hi.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.260
But, I... Moco-chan.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.340
Hi.

00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.082
I don't know.

00:09:48.102 --> 00:09:53.629
If you think about it, maybe we're... Ruffians, you know.

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:55.951
Nobody's supposed to do that, right?

00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.815
Look at a solar lunar eclipse?

00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:04.202
Oh, you know, maybe Pero... Pero was just trying to protect you!

00:10:04.222 --> 00:10:04.383
Right?

00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:08.508
If you look at the lunar eclipse in your eyes, they burn into fire, right?

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:09.770
Isn't that a solar eclipse?

00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:13.135
Huh?

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:16.459
Isn't a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse not the same thing?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:16.560
Huh?

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:23.970
He wasn't protecting you.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.762
One okie solo bag.

00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:28.643
Both aren't safe.

00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:36.113
Hi?

00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:37.915
They're different!

00:10:38.516 --> 00:10:39.637
They're different!

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.365
They're similar, but different.

00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.207
Just like FUWAMOCO!

00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:52.201
Ruffians, I can tell you.

00:10:52.702 --> 00:10:55.954
If you look at us, your eyes aren't gonna burn up.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:57.339
I suppose not.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:01.112
Let us know if...

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.970
BAU BAU!

00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.296
Maybe this was a good Pero sighting.

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:12.578
Maybe it was bad.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:18.769
But today I learned that there's a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse and they are different.

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:19.711
A little dot.

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:21.353
A tiny dot.

00:11:21.954 --> 00:11:24.018
It kind of looks like something on the left.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.863
It's a dot.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.869
BAU BAU!

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:36.056
Well, Ruffians, there's been a bunch of brand new things happening.

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:37.537
Lots of cool ones.

00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:50.351
And just this last past week, we performed together with Ayame-senpai during her 7th anniversary D&D Live!

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:50.771
BAU BAU!

00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:56.597
We performed a song called Mawari Setsugetsuka together with her.

00:11:57.033 --> 00:12:00.664
You know it!

00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:04.757
It's a legendary anime song!

00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:07.642
But a very cheeky one.

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:09.484
A lot of tongue twisters.

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:12.509
Yeah, and it's so fast, so hard to sing.

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:16.775
That's really hard for Japanese people too, you know.

00:12:17.176 --> 00:12:18.618
But we did our best!

00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:20.080
A lot of tongue movement.

00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:21.623
Yeah.

00:12:22.144 --> 00:12:28.373
We practiced a lot a lot, and there was definitely a lot of frustration at times too, huh?

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:35.498
We are so happy together to be able to perform with Ayame-senpai!

00:12:35.518 --> 00:12:38.922
And we are Ayame-senpai's first EN guest too!

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:40.644
It's kind of hard to believe.

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:45.770
BAU BAU!

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:51.596
I don't know, more than anything I was also surprised that Ayame-senpai hadn't sung this song yet.

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:51.777
Right!

00:12:51.797 --> 00:12:54.079
I feel like it's just Ayame-senpai's song.

00:12:56.282 --> 00:12:56.402
Right!

00:12:56.382 --> 00:13:04.239
If I had to say my favorite part, it was the ha ha ha ha ha ha haiya!

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:05.362
Oh no, Moco-chan.

00:13:05.983 --> 00:13:10.032
Lily's favorite part was... my waiting part.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:10.172
Yeah.

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:14.702
That's the main part of the song, huh?

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:21.070
But if you didn't check it out yet, please go check it out on Anime-senpai's channel!

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.874
Yeah, we're able to dance with fans and everything too!

00:13:24.955 --> 00:13:25.937
Very pretty!

00:13:25.957 --> 00:13:29.361
And Anime-senpai has a new outfit too!

00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:30.643
So you have to take a look!

00:13:31.504 --> 00:13:34.928
But on the topic of 3D lives,

00:13:34.908 --> 00:13:43.716
Just hours ago, Botan-senpai had her birthday 3D live!

00:13:44.297 --> 00:13:46.019
It was amazing!

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:51.464
Botan-senpai, she said it was her first music live in 3 years!

00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:52.024
3 years!

00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:56.889
I can't believe it, but we were so so excited!

00:13:56.909 --> 00:13:59.111
I love seeing Botan-senpai singing and dancing!

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.955
And we really love Botan-senpai's music too, so we couldn't leave!

00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:04.476
But, uh...

00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:06.883
We're a little bit busy.

00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:08.726
We're at the studio.

00:14:08.746 --> 00:14:11.651
We only got back until the last song.

00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:19.885
Only to realize... Almost every single song she sung was a Visual Novels song!

00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:23.190
From Visual Novels, Bishoujo Games songs!

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.834
Ruffians!

00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:30.266
Why did you not let us know sooner?

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:33.754
We were so so happy!

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:36.500
So many fevers!

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:40.169
You should've let us know.

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.690
Yeah, it was amazing!

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.635
Nino Towaru Ryuu no Koi no Uta.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.118
Nino-senpai did it before.

00:14:45.138 --> 00:14:46.881
That's my song!

00:14:47.302 --> 00:14:48.745
I say that!

00:14:49.446 --> 00:14:53.273
Nino and Nobuta, let's go!

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:54.075
Let's go!

00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:59.244
Yeah, and us Fudeho's here together with Hanata-senpai too.

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:00.687
Absolutely legendary!

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.690
Amazing.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.752
Yeah.

00:15:04.293 --> 00:15:08.680
I don't know, we definitely need to talk to Botan-senpai more about all of this.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.364
Were you supposed to tell us about it?

00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:13.587
Yes, you were.

00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:15.130
You were supposed to.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.053
Before FUWAMOCO stops what you're doing, go!

00:15:17.073 --> 00:15:18.996
Right!

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:22.662
You were sleeping when it happened and I guess that's a good example.

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:23.924
You should have woken up!

00:15:24.245 --> 00:15:26.288
No, the most important part is you're here now!

00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:30.314
I should have woken up.

00:15:30.335 --> 00:15:37.827
But you definitely need to go check it out and wish Botan-senpai a happy birthday!

00:15:37.847 --> 00:15:38.528
I'm sleeping no doubt!

00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:40.912
I was there together with Botan-senpai too, singing and dancing!

00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:41.693
I'm happy.

00:15:41.713 --> 00:15:44.157
Yeah, she did an amazing job.

00:15:44.137 --> 00:15:47.060
Please go take a look at Advent!

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.744
Of course, Botan-senpai, she also just debuted a brand new original song too!

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:58.369
So go take a listen too, okay?

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.691
BAU BAU!

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:05.035
Happy birthday, Botan-senpai!

00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:06.877
Happy birthday, Botan-senpai!

00:16:06.997 --> 00:16:12.501
My favorite senpai of them all, Birthday-senpai!

00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:13.182
BAU BAU!

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:23.560
Bye bye!

00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:28.908
It was Ayame-senpai's 7th anniversary live.

00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:32.453
It was Sora-senpai's 8th anniversary too.

00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:34.276
It's been months going on!

00:16:34.316 --> 00:16:37.760
And another big anniversary coming up.

00:16:38.862 --> 00:16:43.488
It's Calli-senpai's 5th anniversary.

00:16:43.508 --> 00:16:46.172
5th anniversary.

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:47.929
Morning Calliope.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:54.338
hololive English and Myth is all turning 5 very soon here!

00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:56.442
And Calli's here too!

00:16:56.862 --> 00:17:03.412
She's celebrating with a very special dating show together with VRChat!

00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:06.596
And there's gonna be a new outfit!

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:13.326
But also all of hololive will be there as guests too!

00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:14.488
BAU BAU!

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:17.612
I'm so excited!

00:17:17.632 --> 00:17:23.058
You know, Calli-senpai, she's so, so wonderful, so talented.

00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:24.560
All of our senpai are.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:35.953
Yeah, but you know, sometimes she can get very emotional, especially when it comes to, you know, things like this, so... I would never know what that is like, ever.

00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:43.029
I'm sure you know it's gonna be a very special 5th anniversary celebration.

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:46.976
And a lot of fun too!

00:17:46.996 --> 00:17:54.128
So we hope that you'll be there!

00:17:54.228 --> 00:17:55.731
BAU BAU!

00:18:00.487 --> 00:18:10.681
Off the topic of 3D comics, we have De-den!

00:18:11.202 --> 00:18:13.705
A merch update for FUWAMOCO!

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:19.153
We are very happy to see lots of Ruffians suddenly without beds.

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:23.787
Because they're full with FUWAMOCO-dake!

00:18:23.807 --> 00:18:25.272
Your bed has been taken over!

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:25.392
Look!

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.321
Ruffians!

00:18:28.682 --> 00:18:29.905
No more room for you.

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:33.075
You're gonna have to sleep on the floor now.

00:18:33.427 --> 00:18:36.071
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:41.339
Thank you so much Ruffians for waiting a little bit longer than usual.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.181
It took a little bit of time.

00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:49.993
Yeah, there's some bumps along the road, but I'm happy to see our birthday match finally reaching you!

00:18:50.013 --> 00:18:54.540
There's some Ruffians with some amazing Itabags going!

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.843
You know, the poshi keychain.

00:18:57.244 --> 00:18:57.965
Yeah!

00:18:57.985 --> 00:19:01.590
Now Ruffians, we can go easily with you wherever!

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.794
A bit more portable size!

00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:07.159
Easier to fit in your photos maybe than the friends with you!

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.741
We're really cute!

00:19:08.761 --> 00:19:13.668
Yeah, and also seeing our signed ticket cards added to your signs too!

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:16.112
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:19:16.853 --> 00:19:17.474
Thank you!

00:19:17.494 --> 00:19:19.136
An update from FUWAMOCO too!

00:19:19.176 --> 00:19:22.401
You know we had our 1 million celebration merch!

00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:23.262
I paused!

00:19:23.442 --> 00:19:24.724
I done writing!

00:19:24.804 --> 00:19:26.747
We finished all the signatures!

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:27.788
It finished in a good while.

00:19:27.808 --> 00:19:29.030
A little while ago.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.552
Yeah, that's busy.

00:19:31.013 --> 00:19:36.320
But now that means that maybe they'll be reaching you in mid-November?

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.781
Maybe.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:36.901
Soon!

00:19:38.663 --> 00:19:40.626
That's only like two months away.

00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:45.528
A month and a half ish.

00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:49.111
Are you waiting for a punch?

00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:52.354
We can't wait for it to reach you!

00:19:52.374 --> 00:19:52.714
Now!

00:19:53.415 --> 00:19:57.719
We're already on sighting our second anniversary!

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.522
The paws are still going, Ruffians!

00:20:00.542 --> 00:20:01.783
From one to another!

00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:05.927
And the shirts look so cool!

00:20:05.947 --> 00:20:08.629
I can't wait to see you wearing them, Ruffians!

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:11.372
It'll be perfect with the hat.

00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:14.656
BAU BAU!

00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:15.297
Thank you so so much, Ruffians!

00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:20.024
You know, the FUWAMOCO collection's gonna get very very big this year.

00:20:22.687 --> 00:20:24.349
Is it gonna be okay, Ruffians?

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:26.572
Maybe we'll have to get another shelf, huh?

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:27.734
We were just tidying up.

00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:35.685
And now we're going... We need some shelf suggestions, I think, Ruffians.

00:20:37.567 --> 00:20:38.669
Yeah.

00:20:38.689 --> 00:20:39.950
Yeah, only two years?

00:20:41.192 --> 00:20:41.292
Yeah!

00:20:42.233 --> 00:20:43.996
Another house, another house.

00:20:44.737 --> 00:20:47.001
Maybe a dog house.

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:50.367
What?

00:20:50.387 --> 00:20:50.547
BAU BAU!

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:52.831
Thank you always, always.

00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:55.275
Thank you!

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:59.382
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.735
No, Ruffians, you don't need that.

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:06.482
Because you know there was also the Pero Pushy too.

00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:07.224
BAU BAU!

00:21:07.244 --> 00:21:12.037
I mean, it is life-size, right?

00:21:12.077 --> 00:21:13.641
Pretty much the same.

00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:17.736
BAU BAU!

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:20.680
And Ruffians!

00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:25.748
Just the other day, we're also on the official hololive channel.

00:21:26.088 --> 00:21:30.915
Because there is a very special 3D program with brand new news!

00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:34.260
About 6 of us.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:34.460
And!

00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:40.048
That the Blu-ray just released!

00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:41.130
You can now pre-order it on the hololive shop!

00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:43.466
Amazing, Ruffians.

00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:46.710
It includes all stages and the creator stage.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.872
That's over a hundred songs.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:51.234
You know, I might know a bit what you're thinking.

00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:55.298
I saw it, I went to it, you know.

00:21:55.338 --> 00:21:56.980
I watched, I caught the streaming ticket.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.121
It's just gonna be the same.

00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:00.703
Maybe some angles will be fixed up and done.

00:22:00.723 --> 00:22:01.424
We understand, you know.

00:22:01.464 --> 00:22:02.305
That's what you would think.

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:05.188
But, we were really surprised.

00:22:06.028 --> 00:22:07.550
Yeah.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.571
Holofocus.

00:22:09.432 --> 00:22:11.674
Ruffians, holofocus!

00:22:12.903 --> 00:22:15.727
It's like an OSHI cam, but way better!

00:22:15.747 --> 00:22:16.789
It's completely different!

00:22:17.209 --> 00:22:21.115
Just off your OSHI, brand new angles, close-ups, everything!

00:22:21.356 --> 00:22:21.596
Yeah.

00:22:22.137 --> 00:22:24.581
Basically, every unit's song!

00:22:24.961 --> 00:22:28.747
You can use the whole focus to take a look at your own OSHI!

00:22:29.428 --> 00:22:32.112
And you know, it's not just a straight-on angle!

00:22:32.132 --> 00:22:32.192
No.

00:22:32.633 --> 00:22:38.862
The best angles have been hand-picked so that you can have the best place, the best place, the best perspective!

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:41.286
Watch your OSHI!

00:22:41.306 --> 00:22:42.167
Of course, Alpha-san.

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:47.322
You put so much love into it, Ruffians!

00:22:47.342 --> 00:22:55.754
It came in like... You know, all of us, we worked really, really hard to do the absolute best we could.

00:22:57.537 --> 00:23:09.054
You know, so every time, Ruffians, I think sometimes, you know, you feel very passionate about your oshi, you want to see your oshi from many different angles and perspectives, and maybe sometimes you'll be like, THE CAMERAMAN!

00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:11.418
WHAT'S THE CAMERAMAN DOING?!

00:23:11.438 --> 00:23:12.139
WHAT THE HECK?!

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:12.880
Now,

00:23:13.197 --> 00:23:16.442
You'll never feel like that again, we'll focus a lot.

00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:20.409
So you know, if you want to watch Rebellions and... Ah!

00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:22.673
I want to see Mococo hype up the crowd!

00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:23.474
Right!

00:23:23.534 --> 00:23:27.521
You can just see Moco-chan and be like... I don't want to see Moco-chan!

00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:29.444
I want to see what everybody else is doing!

00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:33.511
I want to see Biboo run across the stage from one side to the other in no time!

00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:34.713
Right!

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:36.235
Almost bumping into everyone!

00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:37.077
You know what?

00:23:37.137 --> 00:23:40.123
Because of Holofocus, you can now see them!

00:23:40.143 --> 00:23:45.855
So you know before, if you went to Sixpence, you saw it on the streaming!

00:23:46.236 --> 00:23:51.987
Now you can experience it with the Blu-ray in a completely different way with Holofocus!

00:23:52.007 --> 00:23:53.751
I'm sort of curious though, I wonder...

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.993
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:03.719
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:12.648
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:13.349 --> 00:24:18.374
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:18.414 --> 00:24:21.797
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:29.385
Who knows what it could have in it?

00:24:29.405 --> 00:24:30.126
So please go check it out, FUWAMOCO!

00:24:30.286 --> 00:24:34.190
And if you're interested in the stream, you see this.

00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:37.593
Moco-chan!

00:24:37.954 --> 00:24:38.755
I did it again.

00:24:38.775 --> 00:24:51.548
I was trying to, you know, make an example of the adrenaline that, you know,

00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:57.919
I'm gonna be like, I can't do it!

00:24:57.979 --> 00:24:59.522
Look at my best attempt now!

00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:02.226
I did it.

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:04.050
That was a pretty good attempt, Moco-chan.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.155
Look at me standing there all silly like she's not gonna do it.

00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:10.982
I am expecting my sister to fail.

00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:12.023
Hai.

00:25:12.204 --> 00:25:15.429
Yeah, I was like, okay, go ahead Moco-chan, go ahead and fail!

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:17.012
Hai!

00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:23.500
Well, but there was a lot of silly moments together with Matsuri-senpai and Ririka-chu.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.342
So, please go take a look too.

00:25:25.562 --> 00:25:34.292
But, holofocus, you know, this means that, well, maybe we can live in a timeline that we're so lucky to get all for one.

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:35.193
No way.

00:25:35.213 --> 00:25:35.614
I know.

00:25:35.654 --> 00:25:40.179
Holofocus, maybe, could it be in the end?

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:40.359
Right!

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:40.820
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:46.206
We'll have to let them know how much you love the holofocus so they can look at it.

00:25:46.186 --> 00:25:47.808
Wasn't that great?

00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:50.751
Yeah.

00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:51.031
Right?

00:25:51.912 --> 00:25:54.034
No more worries about the camera man.

00:25:54.134 --> 00:25:55.536
I know, right?

00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:55.836
Yeah.

00:25:55.856 --> 00:25:59.040
Why did the blue rain take so long for this?

00:26:00.001 --> 00:26:00.742
This is why.

00:26:01.002 --> 00:26:01.843
Holofocus.

00:26:02.003 --> 00:26:02.744
This is why.

00:26:02.764 --> 00:26:04.405
It makes sense now.

00:26:04.426 --> 00:26:04.886
Yeah.

00:26:04.966 --> 00:26:05.927
I see, I see.

00:26:06.828 --> 00:26:08.890
Right?

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.010
Yeah.

00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:10.832
BAU BAU!

00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:11.193
BAU BAU!

00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:15.197
We also very synchronized and funny ways to doing the program, huh?

00:26:15.548 --> 00:26:17.610
I don't know.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.211
I don't know.

00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:21.374
I did one silly backwards running jumping.

00:26:21.394 --> 00:26:23.917
I don't know what that was.

00:26:23.937 --> 00:26:25.399
I saw it, I was like what the heck?

00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:26.420
I never move like that.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.322
Why would we move like that?

00:26:28.342 --> 00:26:30.484
I only went like that because I was petite.

00:26:30.504 --> 00:26:34.609
And then I was like oh I gotta move back out of the way cause I'm gonna get Ririka's way.

00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:38.153
You decided to do the same thing huh?

00:26:38.573 --> 00:26:39.034
I don't know.

00:26:41.396 --> 00:26:42.858
Should we have this kind of power?

00:26:42.898 --> 00:26:43.839
That's a good question.

00:26:43.899 --> 00:26:44.880
I don't know.

00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:52.669
Okay, let's continue here!

00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:53.971
BAU BAU!

00:26:53.991 --> 00:26:55.674
Hi.

00:26:56.675 --> 00:26:59.059
Hello!

00:26:59.079 --> 00:26:59.460
Ruffians!

00:27:01.002 --> 00:27:01.964
It's alright.

00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:04.167
Yeah.

00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:09.636
It's all... Uh-huh.

00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:15.566
Ruffians!

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:27.746
I don't know why this is the case.

00:27:27.927 --> 00:27:31.573
There seems to be some confusion about who tweeted this.

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:46.712
But, Ruffians, you should definitely, definitely know by now when Moco-chan, when she says she didn't do something, that means she's obviously the culprit, right?

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:50.137
That's never how it is.

00:27:50.157 --> 00:27:50.437
Right?

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.622
Ha?

00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:54.803
Yeah.

00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:56.425
Yeah.

00:27:56.445 --> 00:27:57.687
That's never how it is, okay?

00:27:57.707 --> 00:27:58.208
Thank you.

00:27:59.189 --> 00:28:01.232
Yes.

00:28:01.252 --> 00:28:02.033
Uh, well.

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:04.721
It was a bit hot.

00:28:06.483 --> 00:28:10.026
It made me a little bit more than normal.

00:28:10.326 --> 00:28:14.850
I don't want things to be like this, Moco-chan.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.894
Why don't we just remember for this tweet, huh?

00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.775
Don't look proud like that!

00:28:22.357 --> 00:28:23.378
I can't say anything.

00:28:24.339 --> 00:28:26.981
It was just something that I tweeted on the way to the studio.

00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:30.484
I mean, no.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.856
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:28:35.876 --> 00:28:36.056
Ruffians!

00:28:36.237 --> 00:28:36.858
You did amazing!

00:28:36.938 --> 00:28:38.040
There's lots and lots of amazing art!

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.560
Hi!

00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:42.647
Most of it is quote retweeted.

00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:46.854
And we can't see them for some reason.

00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:53.265
They aren't in the hashtag.

00:28:55.743 --> 00:29:01.389
But, you know, there's lots of cute ones like this!

00:29:01.409 --> 00:29:01.870
Cute!

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.290
Right?

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.373
Mococo is... Question mark?

00:29:05.434 --> 00:29:06.955
You have an answer now, right?

00:29:08.897 --> 00:29:10.219
Clear answer!

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:10.579
Cute!

00:29:11.861 --> 00:29:12.401
Nice!

00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:12.621
Cute!

00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:13.562
BAU BAU!

00:29:13.582 --> 00:29:14.884
Mococo is BAU BAU!

00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:16.005
Nice!

00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:18.668
Nice!

00:29:19.469 --> 00:29:20.029
Cute!

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.531
Cute!

00:29:22.772 --> 00:29:23.113
Kawaii!

00:29:23.133 --> 00:29:24.214
Mococo is right!

00:29:24.835 --> 00:29:27.739
Always right.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.107
But um... You know... I'm sorry.

00:29:33.127 --> 00:29:33.948
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:42.341
YouTube actually... Seems to think... I'm too sexy.

00:29:42.361 --> 00:29:48.009
Guys, you know... Me upload is very very... Sexy.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.271
Moshi-chan!

00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:52.936
You know, for my birthday!

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:53.998
And uh...

00:29:55.075 --> 00:30:01.424
YouTube seems like it doesn't want to show anyone it.

00:30:01.444 --> 00:30:01.544
Yeah.

00:30:01.564 --> 00:30:02.585
Yeah.

00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:03.246
Did you see it?

00:30:03.266 --> 00:30:04.087
Did you see it, Ruffians?

00:30:04.528 --> 00:30:05.830
Did YouTube show you it?

00:30:11.738 --> 00:30:12.038
Saw it?

00:30:12.198 --> 00:30:12.839
Question mark?

00:30:14.622 --> 00:30:16.384
Maybe that's a no.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:18.207
You saw it?

00:30:18.227 --> 00:30:18.527
You did!

00:30:18.547 --> 00:30:19.328
You saw it!

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.772
Don't watch shorts, huh?

00:30:23.172 --> 00:30:25.474
Why would you not watch this?

00:30:25.494 --> 00:30:25.995
Huh?

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:34.102
Maybe send it to a friend then.

00:30:34.122 --> 00:30:37.584
You could've asked the Lopez to send this to a friend, Moco-chan!

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:40.547
You can be like, Hi friend!

00:30:41.087 --> 00:30:43.950
I have something very, very sexy to show you.

00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:46.152
Here you go.

00:30:46.172 --> 00:30:48.013
That sounds very suspicious, Moco-chan!

00:30:48.594 --> 00:30:50.175
Suspicious YouTube link.

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:58.413
I don't know, Moco-chan.

00:30:58.473 --> 00:31:03.562
I don't know what this means, but... It means one thing and one thing only.

00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:06.587
You know the answer, right?

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:16.163
Mococo is... Too much for YouTube.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.166
BAU BAU!

00:31:21.186 --> 00:31:26.638
Thank you so much so many creators!

00:31:26.658 --> 00:31:27.160
Thank you!

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.509
Don't forget about Fuwawa.

00:31:31.529 --> 00:31:31.890
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:42.760
On the topic of maybe making your heart beat a little faster than usual, FUWAMOCO!

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:49.868
We're actually going to be right back to the hololive official channel!

00:31:50.248 --> 00:31:57.476
Because we're going to be on a special 3D program for Natsukyuu!

00:31:57.496 --> 00:31:57.656
De-den!

00:31:59.979 --> 00:32:02.181
How do I cover it up?

00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:06.807
It hasn't quite ended!

00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:07.632
We're not gonna let it end!

00:32:07.865 --> 00:32:11.990
We did it and I know there's a big holo by the legs, but!

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:13.531
We're back!

00:32:13.551 --> 00:32:15.774
We're part of the Natsukyuu!

00:32:16.174 --> 00:32:21.280
We're ready to make your heart kyun-kyun a little bit, Ruffians!

00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:25.665
This time it's a lot of firsts for us!

00:32:25.845 --> 00:32:34.335
And we're on the official hololive channel and we're asked to participate in this program in Japanese, so we did our best!

00:32:34.355 --> 00:32:36.117
It was rocking!

00:32:36.097 --> 00:32:44.866
Yeah, but we really hope that in the future that maybe hololive EN on the EN channel we can have more programs like this too, right?

00:32:45.127 --> 00:32:51.794
Well, you don't know what you're looking forward to yet, so... BAU BAU!

00:32:51.814 --> 00:32:52.775
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:54.977
Let's check it out!

00:32:54.997 --> 00:32:55.898
BAU BAU!

00:32:55.918 --> 00:32:56.058
Aha!

00:32:56.078 --> 00:32:58.220
That's more like it, yeah.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.703
You don't have to look at FUWASENPAI anymore.

00:33:01.662 --> 00:33:14.699
Today was a little bit silly to start off the day with.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:19.825
Can you make it a little bit better?

00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:21.888
Can you fix all the problems?

00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:22.649
Can I?

00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:25.172
You can fix all the problems, right?

00:33:29.017 --> 00:33:31.640
I'm gonna try my best, Moco-chan.

00:33:32.161 --> 00:33:32.922
I'll try.

00:33:32.942 --> 00:33:33.783
I can't promise.

00:33:33.803 --> 00:33:36.566
No promises, but... I'll try!

00:33:37.868 --> 00:33:38.429
Okay!

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:40.631
BAU BAU!

00:33:45.277 --> 00:33:46.218
Ruffians!

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.202
It's that time again!

00:33:50.127 --> 00:33:50.528
Ah.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:53.191
I got confused.

00:33:53.912 --> 00:33:58.798
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:03.725
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:06.188
Mococo!

00:34:06.208 --> 00:34:06.528
Ruffians!

00:34:08.991 --> 00:34:09.172
Ruffians!

00:34:10.754 --> 00:34:11.234
You know.

00:34:12.516 --> 00:34:17.923
You know when it's night time and your body is aching.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.232
I need rest!

00:34:23.215 --> 00:34:24.896
I'm sleepy!

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:30.262
I can't do this anymore!

00:34:31.223 --> 00:34:33.025
Yeah.

00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:33.565
You know that.

00:34:35.187 --> 00:34:36.728
You know what time it is then.

00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:45.177
It is time to listen to what you're saying and go to sleep.

00:34:46.253 --> 00:34:54.463
You know, close your eyes, get a good rest, get cozy, and come back again strong the next day in the morning!

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:55.505
Yeah!

00:34:56.446 --> 00:34:56.906
Okay!

00:34:56.926 --> 00:34:57.027
Yeah.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.351
Time to sleep.

00:35:00.972 --> 00:35:01.813
Maybe not right now.

00:35:02.794 --> 00:35:04.756
Later.

00:35:04.776 --> 00:35:08.481
You know, if you do that, you'll thank yourself.

00:35:09.642 --> 00:35:10.102
Got it.

00:35:10.823 --> 00:35:11.323
Every day.

00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:12.985
For a whole week, okay?

00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:14.326
Just try it!

00:35:16.268 --> 00:35:20.671
Let's all power through and make this an amazing week all together!

00:35:23.394 --> 00:35:23.554
BAU BAU!

00:35:26.937 --> 00:35:30.520
BAU BAU!

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:30.780
BAU BAU!

00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:33.763
There's a lot of Ruffians that just woke up, Moco-chan.

00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:34.924
What could this mean?

00:35:34.944 --> 00:35:36.485
I'm not saying go to sleep right now.

00:35:36.565 --> 00:35:38.687
I said night time.

00:35:39.308 --> 00:35:48.820
Like when the Ruffians, when you get home from your busy day, they're like, I wanna go to bed!

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.081
Listen to yourself.

00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:51.884
Don't play Uma Musume.

00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:54.927
Don't play Silksong.

00:35:55.808 --> 00:35:58.532
Other Senpai.

00:35:58.552 --> 00:36:03.878
Or... Members.

00:36:03.899 --> 00:36:04.559
Go to bed!

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.521
Go to bed!

00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:07.543
But not right now, because it's a new week!

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.395
BAU BAU!

00:36:11.415 --> 00:36:11.636
FUWAMOCO!

00:36:11.656 --> 00:36:16.223
Let's take a look at some of our submissions from Ruffians!

00:36:17.506 --> 00:36:22.394
Today we have today's Doggie of the Day!

00:36:23.075 --> 00:36:27.663
And today's Doggie of the Day is... That!

00:36:28.184 --> 00:36:29.025
It's...

00:36:29.697 --> 00:36:31.440
Fluffy dog!

00:36:36.429 --> 00:36:36.650

00:36:40.377 --> 00:36:40.757
Fluffy dog!

00:36:40.778 --> 00:36:40.998
Fluffy dog!

00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:41.238
Fluffy dog!

00:36:41.258 --> 00:36:41.479
Fluffy dog!

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:41.719

00:36:41.759 --> 00:36:42.020

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.304
Oh, so pretty.

00:36:55.684 --> 00:36:58.208
Up with the trends, you know.

00:36:58.308 --> 00:36:59.891
Perfect eyelashes.

00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:01.453
Yeah, flowers.

00:37:01.473 --> 00:37:03.657
You know, also very fashionable.

00:37:03.717 --> 00:37:09.125
Hanging around FUWAMOCO places with you two.

00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:09.245
Yeah!

00:37:09.265 --> 00:37:15.095
But I think we can tell Flower Dog's a very hard-working doggy of a day, huh?

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:16.056
Can probably

00:37:16.762 --> 00:37:17.784
Carry stuff.

00:37:18.665 --> 00:37:18.985
Yes.

00:37:19.146 --> 00:37:21.129
Is flower dog an okay name?

00:37:21.149 --> 00:37:22.731
Flower dog everyday?

00:37:22.751 --> 00:37:24.033
Flower dog.

00:37:24.053 --> 00:37:25.215
Flower dog?

00:37:25.716 --> 00:37:26.137
Yeah.

00:37:26.597 --> 00:37:27.559
Cute.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.362
Moco-chan.

00:37:29.842 --> 00:37:31.665
How does flower dog bow bow?

00:37:36.773 --> 00:37:37.234
Wow!

00:37:38.015 --> 00:37:38.095
Wow!

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:45.719
Maybe the bark was kind of not working so well.

00:37:46.401 --> 00:37:49.671
It's a warning sign.

00:37:50.444 --> 00:37:54.908
Wow, you know, flower dogs are very hard worker.

00:37:54.928 --> 00:37:57.931
He can carry lots of heavy flowers.

00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.273
There's heavy flowers, right?

00:37:59.293 --> 00:38:00.174
Heavy flowers!

00:38:00.294 --> 00:38:01.114
Heavy flowers!

00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:05.759
You know, like the flowers that intertwine two people deeply in love.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.665
Yes, flower dog, flower dog works hard to protect the love of all!

00:38:11.905 --> 00:38:13.046
And very well behaved.

00:38:13.487 --> 00:38:14.708
As a flower dog should be.

00:38:15.529 --> 00:38:18.331
He'll probably carry a boulder.

00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:19.432
A boulder.

00:38:19.452 --> 00:38:19.552
Yeah.

00:38:19.693 --> 00:38:20.113
Of love.

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:22.037
Yes.

00:38:22.138 --> 00:38:23.482
BAU BAU!

00:38:24.325 --> 00:38:25.650
BAU BAU!

00:38:26.051 --> 00:38:27.797
He protects smiles too?

00:38:27.998 --> 00:38:28.078
Yes.

00:38:29.054 --> 00:38:29.815
Also love.

00:38:32.439 --> 00:38:33.921
BAU BAU!

00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:37.866
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:38:38.407 --> 00:38:42.873
We have... De-den!

00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:49.081
That sounds like it was a very long good nature walk.

00:38:49.582 --> 00:38:50.323
Nice walk!

00:38:50.343 --> 00:38:52.446
You know, it sort of looks like...

00:38:52.426 --> 00:38:56.832
You know when people leave forgotten items along a path?

00:38:56.852 --> 00:39:02.059
Ah, like when you're hiking and you're like, oh, there's a hat here, and then you put it up on like a marker?

00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.364
Ah, someone lost their FUWAMOCO here.

00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:08.268
You didn't leave us in the forest, did you?

00:39:08.288 --> 00:39:15.177
You gotta hear a POPO coming from the trees.

00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:16.594
BAU BAU!

00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:20.967
FUWAMOCO!

00:39:20.987 --> 00:39:21.508
BAU BAU!

00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:24.817
I'm sure we powered this Ruffian's walk.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.422
Right, Moco-chan?

00:39:26.442 --> 00:39:27.365
We didn't get lost.

00:39:27.706 --> 00:39:28.889
We didn't get left behind.

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:30.313
Hope so.

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:33.082
Start of a horror game!

00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:37.030
BAU BAU!

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.495
Thank you!

00:39:39.515 --> 00:39:40.617
I'm glad you found a good one!

00:39:40.637 --> 00:39:41.859
And look at all those leaves!

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.466
It's gonna be very, very pretty autumn leaves falling too.

00:39:45.486 --> 00:39:45.947
It's still summer!

00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:48.893
I have summer leaves.

00:39:49.649 --> 00:40:03.670
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:11.522
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:40:11.502 --> 00:40:22.618
Well, you know, we've talked about it a bit before, but we're very particular with the choreography for our songs, you know, especially our originals.

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:26.003
I think we really like fun choreography.

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:28.667
Maybe something that Ruffians can join in together.

00:40:28.934 --> 00:40:29.735

00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:55.489
Gotta get stronger!

00:41:56.279 --> 00:42:03.075
Ruffians, it's time for us to go swimming soon.

00:42:04.979 --> 00:42:06.403
BAU BAU!

00:42:07.385 --> 00:42:12.617
We have the swimsuits now, so pull them Moc-tan.

00:42:15.584 --> 00:42:22.811
Thank you so much for all your submissions, Ruffians!

00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:25.813
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together.

00:42:26.314 --> 00:42:28.355
Here with you, Ruffians!

00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.177
Temporarily, once a week.

00:42:30.197 --> 00:42:33.620
But we're always looking forward to your doggy of a days!

00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:38.064
Seeing your walks that you're going on, especially with maybe new autumn leaves.

00:42:38.525 --> 00:42:40.867
Seeing your questions.

00:42:41.007 --> 00:42:45.591
Such good questions, Ruffians!

00:42:45.571 --> 00:42:53.819
Don't forget to use the hashtag!

00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:56.361
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:42:58.904 --> 00:43:00.365
Thank you Ruffians!

00:43:01.086 --> 00:43:04.670
And we have another stream coming up very shortly!

00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:11.376
We're gonna be playing Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:43:11.879 --> 00:43:14.042
Wow, we're playing it on this nest?

00:43:14.382 --> 00:43:17.006
This nest does not have save states.

00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:19.229
We made a mistake.

00:43:19.249 --> 00:43:20.450
We are out of lives.

00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:25.497
We got too excited after beating the last boss and we didn't save.

00:43:25.517 --> 00:43:27.119
And now we're in a little bit of a pinch.

00:43:27.499 --> 00:43:27.820
But!

00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:30.844
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

00:43:30.944 --> 00:43:33.287
I think we can get through Castle Crush.

00:43:33.808 --> 00:43:36.351
We are crushed in a castle.

00:43:37.377 --> 00:43:39.259
We're getting better at this, Ruffians!

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:41.182
We can do it, okay!

00:43:42.424 --> 00:43:43.945
BAU BAU!

00:43:43.965 --> 00:43:45.748
Snackcorn is currently off.

00:43:45.768 --> 00:43:48.411
Snackcorn has taken a vacation.

00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:49.292
Yes.

00:43:49.312 --> 00:43:53.157
And we'll be back just in time for more Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:43:54.379 --> 00:43:55.600
Please help us, Ruffians!

00:43:55.621 --> 00:43:56.061
I'm feeling confident.

00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:57.563
Moco-chan, how are you feeling?

00:43:59.635 --> 00:44:00.958

Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:44:24.989 --> 00:44:31.302
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
