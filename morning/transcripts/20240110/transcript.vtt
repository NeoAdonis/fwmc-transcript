05:15.225 --> 05:17.361
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:17.441 --> 05:21.304
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:21.324 --> 05:24.787
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:24.907 --> 05:27.169
BAU BAU!

05:28.470 --> 05:31.373
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.275
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:34.376 --> 05:36.758
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:39.554 --> 05:43.340
Today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:43.961 --> 05:44.823
Ruffians!

05:45.043 --> 05:47.808
It's been a while!

05:47.848 --> 05:48.268
You miss us?

05:52.342 --> 05:55.224
Thank you for joining us for our 66th episode today!

05:55.264 --> 05:55.684
Thank you!

05:55.704 --> 05:56.685
BAU BAU!

06:23.156 --> 06:26.240
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

06:26.520 --> 06:26.961
Homework.

06:27.481 --> 06:28.662
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

06:28.863 --> 06:29.483
Homework.

06:29.804 --> 06:30.625
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

06:30.665 --> 06:31.465
Homework.

06:33.568 --> 06:37.392
Well, we're gonna do our best all together today!

06:37.892 --> 06:38.653
Ruffians!

06:39.074 --> 06:44.139
Maybe it's your first time, maybe it's not your first time, but just so you know,

06:45.080 --> 06:51.084
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:51.344 --> 06:51.844
A.k.a.

06:51.904 --> 06:52.505
FUWAMOCO!

06:52.705 --> 06:56.347
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:56.868 --> 07:02.011
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

07:02.531 --> 07:07.194
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

07:07.454 --> 07:11.237
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:11.257 --> 07:11.897
BAU BAU!

07:16.300 --> 07:18.622
Ruffians, are you feeling refreshed?

07:18.962 --> 07:19.482
Refreshed?

07:19.543 --> 07:20.243
Good to go!

07:20.263 --> 07:23.125
Maybe not, it's Wednesday.

07:24.346 --> 07:26.287
Wednesday's not really a refreshing day.

07:28.009 --> 07:31.031
But, maybe you went somewhere fun recently?

07:31.131 --> 07:33.733
I don't know.

07:34.393 --> 07:37.415
I think there's been another Pero Sighting.

07:38.576 --> 07:41.038
And this time, Pero was spotted.

07:45.660 --> 07:46.240
Cafe?

07:46.961 --> 07:49.481
Oh, this looks like a super cute cafe!

07:49.561 --> 07:50.742
A super cute cafe!

07:50.802 --> 07:53.843
Oh, they have those croissant cubes too, huh?

07:54.463 --> 07:56.063
I like croissant cubes.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.144
Croissant cubes!

07:57.244 --> 07:58.164
It's pretty fun!

07:58.184 --> 07:59.824
It's sort of fancy.

08:00.024 --> 08:06.366
But, uh, there's one there that looks like it doesn't really belong, huh?

08:07.447 --> 08:09.607
Is that... Pero?

08:10.908 --> 08:11.328
Pero-san?

08:14.608 --> 08:17.950
I'll have a petal of sun, please!

08:18.131 --> 08:19.591
One petal of sun, please!

08:23.974 --> 08:27.116
You know, it's not like I want one.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.358
I just want to see it.

08:29.438 --> 08:31.919
Why not just, you know, get a petal of sun?

08:32.319 --> 08:36.662
And then you can give it to some seagulls or something.

08:36.702 --> 08:39.104
You can watch them rip it apart!

08:41.544 --> 08:43.425
That sounds good, yeah!

08:43.445 --> 08:46.647
It could be, you know, some morning entertainment.

08:52.290 --> 08:55.452
Well, what is Pero trying to do here though, huh?

08:56.252 --> 08:58.573
Is he trying to get eaten?

08:58.713 --> 09:08.899
Well, maybe not the seagulls, but maybe his plan is to get taken home with a cute girl who likes going around and trying new cafes.

09:11.363 --> 09:12.264
I don't know.

09:12.324 --> 09:14.726
Maybe that's kind of weird.

09:14.806 --> 09:19.371
I don't know.

09:19.391 --> 09:23.615
Yeah, I don't know if he has white chocolate inside.

09:24.336 --> 09:25.417
But kind of a nice hope.

09:25.717 --> 09:28.520
But I think at the very least there's...

09:29.502 --> 09:29.902
BAU BAU!

09:46.071 --> 09:47.493
You might get food poisoning.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.474
You like your petal-less on boneless?

09:51.015 --> 09:55.179
You have to make sure that the tag there, it says boneless.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.360
Boneless petal-less.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.782
You have to pay attention to the line print.

09:59.182 --> 09:59.683
Got it.

09:59.843 --> 10:02.945
You have the croissants with the bones and then the boneless croissants.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.167
It's the two types of croissants, okay?

10:05.648 --> 10:06.989
Bones, boneless.

10:07.269 --> 10:07.709
Got it.

10:08.790 --> 10:11.393
Extra crunch, extra crunch.

10:11.433 --> 10:12.734
The crunch sound is your teeth.

10:16.305 --> 10:23.048
Well, Ruffians, there's been a lot of exciting things happening here with FUWAMOCO.

10:23.068 --> 10:26.170
But more happiness!

10:26.770 --> 10:30.572
White Lava's most recent song cover has reached 200,000 views!

10:30.612 --> 10:34.434
Thank you, Ruffians!

10:36.395 --> 10:43.979
You know, maybe the winter is coming to an end where you are, but we really love it if you could continue to listen to it all year round, okay?

10:43.999 --> 10:48.181
You know, it's a really emotional song and we put all of ourselves into it.

10:48.361 --> 11:00.328
Yeah, you know, but we're really just so happy that you enjoy it this much, despite it being an older song, a bit of an older song, and maybe not so well known outside of Japan.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.310
Thank you so much, ruffians!

11:03.730 --> 11:08.013
We'll continue to work hard to put out new music and cover songs, okay?

11:08.613 --> 11:10.454
Thank you!

11:10.574 --> 11:11.895
BAU BAU!

11:11.915 --> 11:13.176
My love is red hot!

11:13.196 --> 11:16.538
I'm your favorite chihuahua!

11:16.658 --> 11:20.220
Mama puppy likes it a lot, too.

11:21.001 --> 11:24.583
BAU BAU!

11:24.623 --> 11:26.624
Mama puppy was comparing it.

11:29.392 --> 11:30.412
She's silly.

11:30.472 --> 11:36.098
We talked on the phone and then she had to phone us back right after to ask about it.

11:37.158 --> 11:38.660
BAU BAU!

11:39.140 --> 11:41.803
Ruffians!

11:42.223 --> 11:47.067
Something cool just happened just an hour ago!

11:47.087 --> 11:48.549
Do you know what it was?

11:48.629 --> 11:48.889
Do you?

11:55.709 --> 11:56.769
Oh, I see one thing.

11:56.829 --> 11:57.570
Not that one.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.751
Not that one.

12:01.071 --> 12:02.652
Ruffians!

12:02.672 --> 12:09.694
Ai-senpai and Holomith just dropped a new original song all together called Reunion!

12:09.754 --> 12:12.795
BAU BAU!

12:13.175 --> 12:14.176
Did you check it out?

12:14.196 --> 12:17.117
It's on the official hololive English channel.

12:17.157 --> 12:19.017
What you did for the premiere?

12:19.498 --> 12:20.038
What you think?

12:21.124 --> 12:24.586
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

12:24.666 --> 12:26.747
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

12:50.939 --> 12:52.260
They're really cute and touching.

12:52.340 --> 12:55.962
In English, though, you know I can touch you straight in the heart!

12:56.963 --> 13:01.385
And you know, we're just so happy to see all our senpai happy together.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.588
But... You saw us complain about the YouTube premiere volume?

13:07.089 --> 13:08.129
No, you didn't!

13:08.149 --> 13:11.091
My ears were... destroyed.

13:11.111 --> 13:12.332
No, not at all!

13:12.352 --> 13:18.756
But it was okay because your ears, your hearing was reunited when you hear her reunion, right?

13:21.423 --> 13:21.703
Right!

13:22.303 --> 13:27.225
It's the reason why I choose the premiere music I do.

13:27.725 --> 13:32.767
But Ruffians, if you weren't able to check it out, please go and do so right after this.

13:32.807 --> 13:34.288
Like Moco-chan said, after this.

13:34.588 --> 13:35.468
After, okay?

13:36.108 --> 13:38.169
It'll warm up your heart for sure.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.129
BAU BAU!

13:42.563 --> 13:44.103
And more exciting things!

13:44.183 --> 13:47.505
I saw a lot of ruffians talk about this because this is kind of the talk of the hour.

13:47.525 --> 13:47.785
The hour?

13:48.066 --> 13:49.366
The hour talk of the day.

13:49.406 --> 13:50.627
Talk of the week.

13:50.907 --> 13:52.008
Talk of the month.

13:52.028 --> 13:52.568
Big talk.

13:52.948 --> 13:53.709
Big talk.

13:53.909 --> 13:55.329
And more amazing news!

13:55.850 --> 14:00.132
Marine-senchou-senpai just reached 3 million subscribers on YouTube!

14:00.152 --> 14:00.972
BAU BAU BAU!

14:06.134 --> 14:07.875
That's so amazing!

14:07.895 --> 14:09.196
That is crazy.

14:09.256 --> 14:09.756
Oh my gosh.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.157
That is crazy.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.438
Oh my goodness.

14:13.278 --> 14:16.020
I was so happy for her.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.061
Mari-senchou-senpai!

14:18.442 --> 14:24.546
Congratulations on 3 million subscribers!

14:24.646 --> 14:26.147
Congratulations!

14:26.187 --> 14:26.687
BAU BAU!

14:26.707 --> 14:27.788
3 million is a rare number.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.169
3 million... That's amazing.

14:35.878 --> 14:44.045
You know, seeing all the things that Marine-sensho-senpai does really, really inspires us.

14:44.265 --> 14:52.252
You know, we hope that we can be just a little, little bit like her one day and release a lot of really amazing creative works and music.

14:53.453 --> 14:57.937
Actually, sometimes,

14:58.750 --> 14:59.290
FUWAMOCO.

14:59.310 --> 15:03.171
We have a little bit of a tendency to get a bit gloomy.

15:03.551 --> 15:09.892
I'm wondering, you know, if we can ever be anywhere near how amazing My Essential Senpai is.

15:10.012 --> 15:15.573
Yeah, but, you know, we just remind ourselves that, you know, we are FUWAMOCO.

15:16.253 --> 15:19.234
And it hasn't been a year since we debuted.

15:19.754 --> 15:22.955
So, you know, we're just being some baby steps, right?

15:23.215 --> 15:23.875
Baby steps.

15:25.756 --> 15:26.257
BAU BAU!

15:26.297 --> 15:27.197
Well, ruffians, I think... I think...

15:48.769 --> 15:51.952
We might have gotten a bit of a scoop from you!

15:52.433 --> 15:52.873
A scoop?

15:52.893 --> 15:55.436
We got a scoop from a ruffian this one!

15:56.016 --> 15:56.797
Thank you!

15:56.897 --> 16:00.581
Thank you so much for the impeccable journalism!

16:00.641 --> 16:01.802
Doi doi doi!

16:01.942 --> 16:03.283
Doi doi doi!

16:03.323 --> 16:04.244
I scooped it!

16:05.726 --> 16:06.146
Biboo.

16:06.346 --> 16:09.069
Biboo was spreading the curse so well.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.131
Well, during the whole cup.

16:12.045 --> 16:17.551
You know, there is some time where we could actually try to appeal ourselves to everybody watching the stream, right?

16:17.651 --> 16:18.112
Yeah.

16:18.212 --> 16:20.234
Biboo did a good job, you know?

16:20.374 --> 16:23.778
She decided to do what she does best and be silly!

16:23.798 --> 16:27.382
And that was while dancing to the No Rizzler song.

16:28.257 --> 16:28.557
Yeah.

16:28.937 --> 16:32.300
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

16:32.340 --> 16:40.946
She definitely stood out there, but it also seems like there might be some JPNki that are a little bit confused about the song.

16:41.326 --> 16:47.610
You know, it's not necessarily a song filled with love for Abyss, although, you know, we feel like it.

16:47.650 --> 16:48.551
I feel like that.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.732
It makes me feel warm and fluffy.

16:50.832 --> 16:51.253
Yeah.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.375
It's actually supposed to be kind of an annoying song.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.840
Is that because it's too catchy?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.261
It's very catchy, right?

17:01.542 --> 17:05.144
You know the lyrics are strange, but I think it means well.

17:05.164 --> 17:06.465
I think so too.

17:06.645 --> 17:22.577
Ruffians, are you ever like us where sometimes you like wake up in the middle of the night and be like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

17:24.393 --> 17:25.073
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

17:42.304 --> 17:43.405
That part, you know.

17:43.465 --> 17:44.165
That part.

17:44.245 --> 17:44.806
That part.

17:44.986 --> 17:46.327
I'm sorry, ruffians.

17:46.427 --> 17:47.668
Did we hurt you just now?

17:47.688 --> 17:51.470
It'll be okay soon.

17:51.890 --> 17:53.051
It means we're okay.

17:53.271 --> 17:55.333
You can't be mad if it means we're okay.

17:55.733 --> 17:59.455
Yeah, but Biboo definitely did a good job standing out.

17:59.516 --> 18:02.337
You made us proud, Biboo!

18:02.377 --> 18:03.538
We were so proud!

18:03.678 --> 18:06.440
An amazing job in the Chiyo Club, too.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.822
BAU BAU!

18:09.842 --> 18:11.003
BAU BAU!

18:11.243 --> 18:11.864
Amazing.

18:12.844 --> 18:15.045
It's emotional, ruffians.

18:15.406 --> 18:18.447
If you don't feel emotional, I think something's wrong with you, okay?

18:19.088 --> 18:21.049
BAU BAU!

18:21.749 --> 18:23.650
Well, ruffians...

18:28.044 --> 18:32.429
You know how just recently we did a viral response on Twitter, right?

18:32.469 --> 18:34.191
We responded to some of your tweets.

18:34.311 --> 18:38.155
Thank you for so many tweets!

18:38.175 --> 18:44.962
We had so much fun, but doing it, we got a question asking Moco-chan if she felt that

18:46.571 --> 19:02.344
I, Fuwawa, me, Fuwawa, if I'm a skeevy dog, a skeevy dog, and me, Fuwawa, I responded back saying that, well, maybe it's Koyori-senpai's fault, you know it.

19:02.865 --> 19:03.285
Right?

19:03.665 --> 19:05.146
Right, ruffians?

19:05.707 --> 19:06.067
Right?

19:07.548 --> 19:08.789
A scaby dog.

19:08.849 --> 19:12.052
That's what Koyori-senpai said.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.733
A scaby dog.

19:14.033 --> 19:19.777
But you know, Koyori-senpai, as you can see, she caught wind of it.

19:20.178 --> 19:22.259
Yeah, who told on us, ruffians?

19:22.359 --> 19:24.661
Right, who told on us?

19:24.921 --> 19:28.624
So she asked Moco-chan directly if she thought that.

19:30.276 --> 19:32.677
I don't know if I was a skeevy dog.

19:32.697 --> 19:35.599
Moco-chan, you said that we're both the same.

19:35.619 --> 19:37.600
We're not that skeevy.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.281
You know, we're always together.

19:39.301 --> 19:43.844
So, I don't know why, ruffians, why do you think we're so different?

19:45.264 --> 19:46.765
I don't know why you think this.

19:47.305 --> 19:48.526
We're always together.

19:48.546 --> 19:51.828
We're not that different.

19:52.708 --> 19:58.432
But you know, Koyori-senpai, she doesn't really seem to believe this though, huh?

19:58.752 --> 19:59.032
No.

20:00.336 --> 20:01.556
What do you think, ruffians?

20:04.597 --> 20:07.277
We aren't skeevier than Koyori-senpai, right?

20:09.038 --> 20:10.998
We are pretty different, right?

20:11.038 --> 20:12.918
We're twins, but we have different points.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.839
We're not that different.

20:15.359 --> 20:18.559
We have the same likes, the same skills.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.740
We aren't different.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.741
Thank you, that's true.

20:25.001 --> 20:26.221
We're twins, okay?

20:29.295 --> 20:29.555
Pink.

20:29.936 --> 20:30.296
Blue.

20:30.556 --> 20:32.258
Yes.

20:32.278 --> 20:43.150
I don't know what Koyori-senpai's thinking, but we hope that we can play lots and learn lots from Koyori-senpai in the near future!

20:43.490 --> 20:45.612
It was really fun at the club.

20:45.632 --> 20:47.655
We're so lucky to be surrounded by

20:48.135 --> 20:51.876
So many amazing senpai that we can learn from.

20:52.216 --> 20:54.157
We feel like that every single day.

20:54.637 --> 20:57.979
I feel funny being like, I love senpai!

20:58.399 --> 20:59.139
But it's true.

20:59.219 --> 21:03.080
It's hard not to love all your senpai when they're all so talented and so nice.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.441
Amazing and nice.

21:05.481 --> 21:06.421
Sorry.

21:06.442 --> 21:09.803
BAU BAU!

21:10.483 --> 21:13.284
Okay, so the conclusion is, we're not

21:15.097 --> 21:17.498
We're not skeevy dogs, ruffians!

21:17.858 --> 21:19.899
Koeri-senpai is a skeevy dog?

21:19.979 --> 21:21.920
Is Koeri-senpai a skeevy dog?

21:21.940 --> 21:23.121
She's a skeevy dog.

21:23.141 --> 21:26.282
There's the answer.

21:26.803 --> 21:31.065
BAU BAU!

21:32.045 --> 21:34.466
Well, it's the middle of the week somehow.

21:34.907 --> 21:38.048
Ruffians is this week on as fast as it has been.

21:38.088 --> 21:38.848
You as it has us.

21:40.236 --> 21:43.199
Hopefully it has, but it is not!

21:43.459 --> 21:45.641
Moco-chan, you have some words, right?

21:50.185 --> 21:51.286
Ruffians!

21:52.647 --> 21:54.829
It's that time again!

21:55.971 --> 22:01.476
It's time that you're gonna listen up, because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

22:02.116 --> 22:04.899
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

22:06.863 --> 22:09.926
Somehow, we're already into the thick of it!

22:10.627 --> 22:13.110
The thick of 2024!

22:13.590 --> 22:15.813
You know, it can be pretty exciting.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.416
A new year, a bunch of plans!

22:19.236 --> 22:23.681
But, sometimes, it can be a bit overwhelming too.

22:24.642 --> 22:28.827
Sometimes it can feel like it's hard to see which way you need to go, right?

22:30.046 --> 22:39.515
But you know, when you feel a bit overwhelmed and aren't sure what to do with your feelings, sometimes the best thing you can do is just take a step back for a bit.

22:40.716 --> 22:42.397
Maybe go on a bit of a walk!

22:43.198 --> 22:44.239
Try something new!

22:44.259 --> 22:52.226
That way, maybe you can figure out why you feel that way and can come back feeling refreshed and ready to go!

22:52.967 --> 22:53.827
Sometimes, you know,

22:54.932 --> 23:02.998
Giving yourself a push towards your goal is necessary, but pushing yourself hard to do something that you don't want to do isn't always the right answer.

23:04.199 --> 23:08.002
You have to think of the importance of the journey, not just the destination, okay?

23:08.022 --> 23:19.031
And you know, I hope that if you ever feel a bit overwhelmed, that you feel comfortable coming back here to us for headbutts.

23:20.052 --> 23:22.854
And that you know, when we feel a bit overwhelmed,

23:23.373 --> 23:25.655
Remember when you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.

23:43.724 --> 23:46.865
We're always waiting here, okay?

23:46.885 --> 23:50.646
We'll be here for you.

23:51.746 --> 23:52.646
BAU BAU!

23:53.146 --> 23:55.287
Do we have a Doggie of the Day today?

23:55.307 --> 24:01.908
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Stella!

24:02.048 --> 24:03.849
BAU BAU!

24:03.869 --> 24:04.829
She's ready for this!

24:05.469 --> 24:10.093
You know, it looks like a really good orange.

24:10.253 --> 24:13.415
I haven't had any oranges for a while.

24:34.651 --> 24:48.625
Mochi, if you put kagami mochi in my head... It'd probably fall and then I'd eat it.

24:49.366 --> 24:50.087
BAU BAU!

24:50.147 --> 24:52.089
How do you think Stella BAU BAUs?

24:52.409 --> 24:55.792
You know, with the... With the orange on the hat there.

24:59.035 --> 24:59.815
BAU BAU.

25:00.596 --> 25:01.476
A bit disappointed.

25:01.516 --> 25:02.276
BAU BAU.

25:02.917 --> 25:04.578
Gaman shiteru you de.

25:04.618 --> 25:05.258
BAU BAU.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.018
Holding back.

25:06.479 --> 25:07.599
BAU BAU.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.081
BAU BAU.

25:10.101 --> 25:11.962
Trying to stay up a little bit.

25:12.482 --> 25:13.522
BAU BAU.

25:13.722 --> 25:14.323
BAU BAU.

25:14.583 --> 25:15.503
BAU BAU.

25:15.523 --> 25:16.144
BAU BAU.

25:16.184 --> 25:20.526
BAU BAU in the star!

25:20.926 --> 25:23.047
She's such a good girl.

25:23.187 --> 25:25.149
And beautiful too!

25:25.509 --> 25:25.749
I think

25:26.480 --> 25:31.786
She had a very wonderful end of the year and start of the year together with you as well.

25:32.968 --> 25:38.274
And you know, even though she can't eat the orange right now, I think she knows she'll get an orange eventually.

25:38.334 --> 25:39.495
Eventually.

25:39.695 --> 25:40.216
She better.

25:41.618 --> 25:45.842
But after, maybe a month from now, there'll be a lot of yummies waiting for her.

25:46.943 --> 25:47.484
Ruffians!

25:47.544 --> 25:49.586
You've been out going for walks, right?

26:07.385 --> 26:07.986
It is a threat.

26:08.006 --> 26:08.366
Go on a walk.

26:08.386 --> 26:10.788
Let's see what walks you've been on.

26:10.808 --> 26:11.889
Today's walk is... De-den!

26:22.347 --> 26:25.949
It looks like it was the perfect weather for a nice walk in the countryside, huh?

26:26.290 --> 26:27.450
It looks like a movie.

26:27.571 --> 26:28.871
It's kind of glossy.

26:28.891 --> 26:35.276
But we're so glad that you were able to get out and decompress from the busyness of everything.

26:35.776 --> 26:39.518
Actually, it sort of reminds me of a princess movie.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.521
A princess movie!

26:42.801 --> 26:43.441
You know what?

26:43.862 --> 26:45.943
It looks like a princess movie.

26:45.983 --> 26:46.964
Nice lily pads?

26:47.024 --> 26:50.126
Yeah, cause there's lily pads in princess movies, huh?

26:50.146 --> 26:53.248
This ruffian leper walked right into a princess movie, huh?

26:53.268 --> 26:53.889
Exactly!

26:53.969 --> 26:57.051
You didn't know it, but you're the princess.

26:57.491 --> 27:01.414
Hopefully he can go on more good walks soon.

27:02.195 --> 27:03.936
BAU BAU!

27:06.596 --> 27:07.536
No, but you're the princess.

27:07.556 --> 27:08.357
You're the princess!

27:08.417 --> 27:10.017
Congratulations!

27:11.677 --> 27:16.379
And for our question of the day... We have de-den!

27:16.699 --> 27:18.359
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

27:18.559 --> 27:18.819
Hello!

27:18.879 --> 27:23.120
We know every hololive member gets to ask for a wish.

27:23.380 --> 27:29.842
Within reason, when they reach 1 million subscribers, have you given any thought about what yours might be?

27:30.142 --> 27:30.582
Well...

27:33.583 --> 27:35.065
I have one million wishes.

27:35.705 --> 27:40.590
We've actually thought about it a little bit.

27:40.610 --> 27:43.933
But you know, we still have a ways to go.

27:43.993 --> 27:47.816
But we're going to work hard so that maybe it can be sooner than later.

27:49.073 --> 27:58.263
But I think that we would both like to wish for something that would be hard to make come true normally.

27:58.323 --> 28:02.046
Something maybe that requires a lot of talented individuals to make.

28:02.687 --> 28:05.830
But you know, we're not sure what the rules are, you know?

28:07.151 --> 28:09.193
Surely we can't just wish for anything.

28:09.233 --> 28:09.633
Right.

28:09.853 --> 28:10.914
Could you wish for two wishes?

28:10.994 --> 28:12.115
See, I don't think so.

28:12.415 --> 28:13.536
I don't think so.

28:14.356 --> 28:17.078
Yeah, but you know, we have some good ideas, you know.

28:17.638 --> 28:21.181
And based on what we're allowed to do, let's use what we think is best.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.561
Right.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.022
Wish for more wishes!

28:24.543 --> 28:29.506
That would be cool if we get two wishes, but I don't think that's very fair to the other members, right?

28:29.546 --> 28:30.186
Right.

28:30.246 --> 28:32.048
So... Ask for 1.5 wishes?

28:32.288 --> 28:34.349
We'll just have to ask for very very good wishes.

28:34.369 --> 28:35.149
Wrestling stream!

28:36.290 --> 28:37.191
Wrestling stream.

28:37.231 --> 28:39.013
Would you want that for our 1 million views?

28:39.074 --> 28:40.375
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

28:40.435 --> 28:41.356
Would you be happy?

28:41.376 --> 28:42.017
Would you think?

28:42.037 --> 28:42.337
Okay.

28:42.778 --> 28:44.980
FUWAMOCO, I'm good with that.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.182
They made a good decision.

28:46.202 --> 28:46.262
Yes!

28:47.083 --> 28:47.563
Yes!

28:48.104 --> 28:48.244
Yes!

28:52.650 --> 28:53.832
We'll think about it.

28:54.332 --> 28:55.494
We'll have to think about it.

28:55.614 --> 28:56.516
One million wishes.

28:57.437 --> 29:00.682
We're excited for that wish to come true one day.

29:00.722 --> 29:05.309
More than anything, we're just looking forward to the journey together with you all.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.051
Exactly.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.252
BAU BAU!

29:08.572 --> 29:14.494
Thank you so much, FUWAMOCO fans, for all your submissions for making FUWAMOCO Morning what it is.

29:14.814 --> 29:22.397
We're always looking forward to more Doggie of the Day, seeing what walks you're going on, and which movie you're gonna walk into next, huh?

29:22.797 --> 29:26.759
Yeah, and your questions, and also Pero Sightings too.

29:27.479 --> 29:29.080
Always waiting, okay?

29:29.540 --> 29:29.700
And!

29:30.674 --> 29:35.838
For your journalism with the FUWAMOCO scoop too, put on a journalism hat!

29:37.079 --> 29:39.101
Thank you so much for watching!

29:39.161 --> 29:40.682
BAU BAU!

29:48.208 --> 29:50.969
It's going to be really, really soon.

30:14.923 --> 30:18.765
We're gonna have to eat a lot of sushi, so make sure, Moco-chan, that your tummy is empty, okay?

30:19.326 --> 30:20.786
Empty tummy.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.608
Best way to return!

30:24.148 --> 30:29.071
We're gonna have a lot of fun, so we hope you'll be there, maybe!

30:29.131 --> 30:31.012
Ruffians, you can have sushi too with us!

30:32.553 --> 30:34.354
BAU BAU!

30:34.794 --> 30:46.698
And if we take a little peek at our schedule here, well, we have some lethal company collabs, but between that, we have a rock n' roll party!

30:46.718 --> 30:47.618
Rock n' roll party!

30:47.698 --> 30:49.139
Are you excited, ruffians?

30:49.619 --> 30:51.880
The first rock n' roll party of the year!

30:51.940 --> 30:52.380
Right!

30:52.560 --> 30:55.161
After our countdown one, that kind of is right in between.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.041
I'd say it's more 2023 than anything.

30:57.061 --> 30:57.442
Yeah, yeah.

30:59.082 --> 31:00.062
Excited!

31:00.603 --> 31:02.944
Can we not tell them now?

31:03.344 --> 31:05.845
No, let's tell them Friday is a bit late.

31:05.905 --> 31:09.106
No, I can tell them Friday is a bit late.

31:09.166 --> 31:09.586
Friday?

31:09.606 --> 31:11.407
You okay with Friday, Ruffians?

31:13.428 --> 31:14.328
You okay with Friday?

31:18.148 --> 31:19.529
FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:19.549 --> 31:21.972
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

31:39.609 --> 31:41.672
Nemurenai yoru ni wa.

31:43.374 --> 31:45.797
No, that's not the thing!

31:46.057 --> 31:48.820
But this time we're going to be less silly.

31:49.281 --> 31:53.286
So we hope that you're ready to hear some great thoughts about BAU BAU!

31:54.708 --> 31:55.789
BAU BAU!

31:58.819 --> 32:00.740
BAU BAU!

32:01.040 --> 32:05.561
We're looking forward to spending some more fun times together, ruffians!

32:06.241 --> 32:07.101
Thank you!

32:07.221 --> 32:12.842
Thank you for waking up early and joining us for another FUWAMOCO Morning today!

32:12.862 --> 32:19.263
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special ruffians!

And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

33:10.874 --> 33:13.835
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:13.936 --> 33:15.316
