06:01.930 --> 06:03.554
Hello BAU BAU!

06:04.195 --> 06:07.401
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:07.662 --> 06:09.145
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

06:13.762 --> 06:17.103
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

06:17.643 --> 06:20.204
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

06:20.344 --> 06:22.945
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

06:23.125 --> 06:25.245
BAU BAU!

06:25.906 --> 06:30.167
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:30.667 --> 06:31.747
Ruffians!

06:31.907 --> 06:32.527
Sky Blinding!

06:32.567 --> 06:35.128
BAU BAU!

06:35.288 --> 06:37.529
It's been a little while, Ruffians!

06:38.950 --> 06:42.433
Thank you for joining us today for our 127th episode!

06:42.714 --> 06:49.461
We're so happy to be back!

06:49.561 --> 06:50.942
Yeah, it's been a while!

06:50.982 --> 06:55.287
Yeah, there's been a little bit of different programming going on.

06:56.027 --> 06:57.848
It's a bit different than normal, huh?

06:58.328 --> 07:00.769
But we're back for our 127th episode!

07:00.889 --> 07:03.610
Thank you for waking up, Ruffians!

07:03.670 --> 07:04.510
Thank you!

07:04.550 --> 07:05.790
BAU BAU!

07:06.251 --> 07:11.412
Well, for Ruffians who are just joining us for the first time today... Good morning!

07:11.552 --> 07:12.453
Good morning!

07:12.833 --> 07:13.853
FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:13.873 --> 07:18.975
It's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday!

07:19.375 --> 07:19.855
A.K.A.

07:19.935 --> 07:20.755
FUWAMOCO!

07:21.155 --> 07:22.376
And it's hosted by us!

07:22.956 --> 07:24.457
FUWAMOCO!

07:24.477 --> 07:30.302
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:30.382 --> 07:30.943
Yeah!

07:31.403 --> 07:33.805
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

07:34.105 --> 07:36.927

More hashtag, hashtag.

07:55.119 --> 07:56.559
I just had an idea.

07:57.820 --> 07:58.960
Huh?

07:59.260 --> 07:59.780
Can I down?

07:59.980 --> 08:00.520
Can I down?

08:00.920 --> 08:01.380
Okay.

08:02.501 --> 08:02.861
Okay.

08:11.875 --> 08:15.497
My first idea of the day, Ruffians!

08:16.017 --> 08:17.638
BAU BAU!

08:17.818 --> 08:19.019
BAU BAU!

08:19.079 --> 08:21.460
I hope you have your first idea of the day soon.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.161
Yeah.

08:23.201 --> 08:23.641
Yeah.

08:23.781 --> 08:24.482
BAU BAU!

08:25.102 --> 08:27.203
BAU BAU!

08:27.463 --> 08:32.005
Well, Ruffians, it's been about a week since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

08:32.205 --> 08:33.046
Yeah.

08:33.326 --> 08:37.308
But there's been a lot of stuff going on.

08:37.328 --> 08:37.388
Yes!

08:37.408 --> 08:39.089
Let's take a look.

08:40.330 --> 08:40.850
Actually...

08:42.622 --> 08:44.722
What else do we have?

08:46.983 --> 08:47.443
You know.

08:47.883 --> 08:48.163
What?

08:48.263 --> 08:48.503
What?

08:48.623 --> 08:48.863
What?

08:49.503 --> 08:51.544
What do you mean you know, Moco-chan?

08:52.084 --> 08:55.985
Pero Sighting.

08:56.085 --> 08:59.445
We've been holo-santos for a week, Ruffians!

08:59.826 --> 09:05.787
I didn't see Pero really there that long.

09:05.887 --> 09:06.727
Sighting, but...

09:07.468 --> 09:09.189
Did you see all the Ruffians?

09:09.269 --> 09:10.089
Let's take a look.

09:10.689 --> 09:11.610
Okay.

09:12.230 --> 09:12.950
Okay.

09:13.450 --> 09:17.212
De-den!

09:17.372 --> 09:17.652
What?

09:17.812 --> 09:18.172
What?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.053
What is this?

09:20.333 --> 09:20.613
Huh?

09:20.773 --> 09:22.333
A petal flower?

09:22.513 --> 09:23.874
He's a baboon!

09:24.154 --> 09:24.794
Yeah!

09:25.074 --> 09:25.715
Baboon?

09:25.795 --> 09:28.476
I don't know if I like the sound of that.

09:29.176 --> 09:30.916
It sounds so cheerful though, no?

09:31.817 --> 09:32.057
Maybe?

09:33.343 --> 09:41.506
But, you know, Ruffians, well, you know they say it's not good to really pick flowers, right?

09:41.786 --> 09:42.707
Without permission.

09:42.747 --> 09:46.788
Yeah, because then somebody, they're gonna not be able to enjoy the flower.

09:46.828 --> 09:51.270
It's only gonna be you who enjoys the flower, especially when they're not yours and stuff.

09:51.390 --> 09:56.192
If they're not yours, that's one thing, but if you want to pick the flower and it's yours, then you're okay.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.313
But, but, I feel like...

10:00.790 --> 10:03.471
In this case, this is a special case for a friend!

10:03.892 --> 10:09.695
You know, so, uh... Why don't you go ahead... Pick that flower!

10:09.855 --> 10:13.157
Give it to someone who would really truly appreciate it, you know?

10:13.177 --> 10:15.058
Someone like maybe...

10:16.380 --> 10:17.161
Garbage can.

10:18.221 --> 10:21.304
Why?

10:21.584 --> 10:26.168
I guess at that point, it would be now a... It was a miracle of nature.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.409
Yeah.

10:27.529 --> 10:27.789
It was.

10:27.889 --> 10:29.070
Past tense.

10:29.350 --> 10:32.193
No petal flowers!

10:32.573 --> 10:33.834
No, we don't need those.

10:33.894 --> 10:34.795
BAU BAU!

10:35.175 --> 10:39.058
Petal flower.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.681
The least liked flower by FUWAMOCO.

10:42.981 --> 10:44.903
Imagine getting a bouquet like that.

10:47.315 --> 10:48.396
I don't want to imagine that.

10:48.676 --> 10:50.118
That's really nasty.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.140
That's a bouquet of flowers you give to your worst enemy.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.301
Yeah.

10:54.962 --> 10:55.222
Yeah.

10:55.443 --> 10:55.823
I guess.

10:56.143 --> 10:57.544
Ruffians, what do you think?

10:57.605 --> 10:57.905
Yes?

10:58.846 --> 11:00.687
You like a sexy flower?

11:01.048 --> 11:01.508
Huh?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.250
Huh?

11:05.832 --> 11:05.972
Huh?

11:06.032 --> 11:06.773
What flower?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.014
A sexy flower.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.957
We're talking about nasty flowers.

11:13.302 --> 11:15.664
It's okay, forget it, forget it.

11:15.764 --> 11:18.345
FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:18.525 --> 11:20.887
Look, we got distracted there.

11:21.287 --> 11:26.630
But you know, there's been some really big important things going on since our last FUWAMOCO Morning.

11:26.650 --> 11:31.333
So let's introduce some of them, shall we?

11:31.393 --> 11:38.298
I'm sure you've heard Ruffians, but... Sure, but... Wow, some big important news is that... Wow.

11:39.190 --> 11:43.512
Our very dear senpai, Amelia Watson of Holomyth.

11:43.973 --> 11:48.375
She's announced that she'll be ending her streaming activities at the end of this month.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.316
It's not a graduation though!

11:50.416 --> 11:54.579
No, it's just, it will be the end of her current activities though.

11:55.159 --> 11:57.700
You know, it's hard to say goodbye.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.062
But we're wishing her the absolute best!

12:00.602 --> 12:03.203
We'll treasure all the special memories we made together!

12:04.604 --> 12:05.786
Not graduating.

12:06.827 --> 12:11.494
But FUWAMOCO, you know, we really wish that we could have gotten to know Ame-senpai even better.

12:12.054 --> 12:16.741
But the times that we did shit, you know, like we had the spelling bee!

12:17.221 --> 12:18.643
And then a manga.

12:27.069 --> 12:38.872
We were really super lucky to be able to have our first and last collab together with Ame-senpai!

12:38.892 --> 12:43.713
Just the other day we solved some puzzles in Escape Simulator!

12:44.053 --> 12:46.394
It's just like we had always dreamed of!

12:46.874 --> 12:48.935
That was one of my big dreams.

12:49.015 --> 12:50.296
They were a bit tricky too, huh?

12:50.316 --> 12:53.679
Yeah, some of them really were, but... Good morning.

12:54.759 --> 12:55.580
It was really fun.

12:55.720 --> 13:00.343
I liked how Ame-senpai was like, FUWAMOCO, do you wanna do this part?

13:00.924 --> 13:01.864
It was very nice.

13:03.305 --> 13:04.847
We could've done very well, huh?

13:05.187 --> 13:07.909
It was really fun sitting with the wand, though!

13:07.929 --> 13:11.272
Please check it out if you haven't, okay?

13:11.553 --> 13:13.094
Yeah, I saw there was one comment.

13:13.194 --> 13:18.139
Oh, if Ame- If Ame-senpai, if she does this, she'll get it on the first try.

13:20.395 --> 13:22.197
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

13:22.237 --> 13:25.500
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.161
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

13:39.873 --> 13:42.976
Everything that she's done that she's brought to us.

13:43.677 --> 13:45.498
All of hololive English!

13:45.819 --> 13:49.843
But she still has a very exciting week coming up.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.464
Lots of really cool things.

13:51.484 --> 13:52.065
Let's take a look.

13:52.085 --> 13:53.266
There's a sketch meeting.

13:53.286 --> 13:55.929
It's a little bit small, so it's hard to see here.

13:55.949 --> 14:00.854
But obviously we have some Elden Ring Endurance streams coming up.

14:01.833 --> 14:05.155
Wow, you know Ame-senpai was playing Elden Ring a lot then.

14:05.715 --> 14:09.837
I guess maybe we're gonna see where that adventure goes even more.

14:09.857 --> 14:13.920
And then there's gonna be a Valve multiplayer marathon too!

14:14.020 --> 14:20.483
But, I guess more FUWAMOCO will be there when we play Team Fortress 2 and Garry's Mod as well.

14:20.523 --> 14:23.785
There's gonna be a bunch of other Valve games being

14:23.925 --> 14:25.667
Ocean Charity Stream

14:41.606 --> 14:44.548
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

14:44.588 --> 14:47.050
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

15:04.123 --> 15:05.825
Yeah, that will be really special too.

15:05.845 --> 15:10.249
And then, on the 30th, on September 30th at 5pm PT.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.673
That will be Ame-senpai's final stream there.

15:13.693 --> 15:16.676
Make sure you don't miss it, okay Ruffians?

15:19.839 --> 15:25.165
It might be hard sometimes, but let's all make sure to be able to say goodbye with a smile.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.087
We'll smile!

15:26.527 --> 15:33.275
Yeah, and of course, FUWAMOCO will be there watching the Miz Club and Abyss Senpai's final stream too, so...

15:35.638 --> 15:38.440
Thank you for everything, everyone!

15:38.600 --> 15:43.282
And I look forward to the remaining series that we have here together.

15:43.362 --> 15:43.902
BAU BAU!

15:44.002 --> 15:46.364
Let's make it really fun again!

15:46.644 --> 15:47.244
BAU BAU!

15:47.324 --> 15:48.525
BAU BAU!

15:51.648 --> 15:58.410
We are FUWAMOCO!

15:58.690 --> 16:02.492
Ruffians!

16:03.152 --> 16:03.652
We did it!

16:03.892 --> 16:04.332
We did it!

16:04.473 --> 16:08.354
We finally made our hologram debut!

16:12.224 --> 16:17.709
If you're maybe wondering what exactly hologram is, the full title is holo no graffiti.

16:17.809 --> 16:23.233
It's a very long running 3D anime that airs on the hololive official channel every week.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.835
And by air I mean like there's a new episode.

16:26.076 --> 16:27.117
But air sounds cooler.

16:28.443 --> 16:31.104
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.365
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

16:33.385 --> 16:35.747
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

16:47.672 --> 16:49.373
You're like a pondering butterfly!

16:51.075 --> 16:54.577
You're definitely in nature, huh?

16:55.157 --> 16:56.598
A pondering butterfly.

16:56.879 --> 16:59.460
You're like me having a fever!

16:59.480 --> 17:01.242
Fuwawa scream!

17:01.262 --> 17:03.103
This is not anything like it.

17:11.783 --> 17:12.964
That's probably it.

17:13.145 --> 17:13.845
That's pretty it.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.947
What do you think, Ruffians?

17:15.967 --> 17:24.735
Within the 1 minute and 50 seconds, I think you can see just how much trouble and silliness that we could get into.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.557
It was pretty close.

17:27.597 --> 17:28.438
It was perfect.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.961
BAU BAU!

17:32.381 --> 17:34.163
If you like the part where we hug the most.

17:35.864 --> 17:36.565
When was that?

17:37.185 --> 17:38.787
I thought it was maybe that part.

17:42.787 --> 17:48.809
Ruffians, if you haven't watched it yet, please go over to the official hololive channel!

17:48.829 --> 17:55.831
Check it out and make sure to leave a comment on the episode just to let us know how much you liked seeing us in hololive!

17:58.012 --> 18:00.613
Somehow, I don't know how it happened, but

18:25.707 --> 18:26.788
hololive GTA.

18:26.928 --> 18:29.391
The week long hololive GTA event.

18:29.952 --> 18:33.176
It came to an end and it ended with a big bang!

18:33.536 --> 18:34.637
Yeah!

18:35.058 --> 18:37.180
Can we explain in case they don't know?

18:37.200 --> 18:37.281
Yeah!

18:37.541 --> 18:40.644
Well... We mentioned this lately before, but...

18:41.285 --> 18:47.808
But the reason behind why FUWAMOCO Morning wasn't on last week was because of this very big event.

18:47.848 --> 18:53.631
You know, all of hololive JP, ID, EN, device, it was that big event.

18:53.891 --> 18:56.912
All of us were all participating in holo GTA.

18:56.992 --> 19:00.554
Yeah, and it was our first time ever too!

19:00.694 --> 19:01.574
Yeah, right!

19:01.594 --> 19:03.135
We had no clue what to expect.

19:03.235 --> 19:04.395
Yeah, you're still catching up.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.936
There's a lot that went on.

19:05.956 --> 19:06.857
There is a lot.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.178
So many different perspectives.

19:10.158 --> 19:11.199
A lot of chaos.

19:11.379 --> 19:12.200
A lot of laughs.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.360
Heartbreak.

19:13.461 --> 19:14.581
Betrayal.

19:15.182 --> 19:15.702
Everything.

19:15.722 --> 19:15.782
Wow.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.864
It has everything.

19:18.024 --> 19:18.324
Yeah.

19:18.364 --> 19:19.545
And of course explosions.

19:19.585 --> 19:19.925
Yeah.

19:19.965 --> 19:21.246
But to explain a bit more!

19:21.286 --> 19:21.426
Yes!

19:21.847 --> 19:24.789
Well, we moved to the town of Holosantos!

19:25.209 --> 19:27.891
And we did our best working different professions.

19:27.931 --> 19:29.672
You know, there was the gang.

19:29.692 --> 19:30.653
And the police.

19:30.813 --> 19:33.295
They had civilians like the bakery.

19:33.535 --> 19:36.037
The cabaret.

19:36.357 --> 19:36.958
You know the...

19:38.296 --> 19:44.598
FUWAMOCO!

19:44.638 --> 19:48.419
You'd think that we might have been working at the cat cafe.

19:48.739 --> 19:53.240
But we became medics and we're working at the pillbox hospital!

19:53.260 --> 19:56.441
Because, you know, this is a roleplay series.

19:56.481 --> 19:59.882
So, you know, it's a bit different than normal life!

19:59.922 --> 20:01.242
Yeah, but we're just a bit...

20:01.502 --> 20:04.364
We are working under the head medic Fubuki-sensei!

20:04.424 --> 20:13.630
Together with a bunch of other medics like Banjo-sensei, Ina-sensei, Iris-sensei, Iofi-sensei, Ririka-sensei.

20:14.090 --> 20:16.332
It was a lot of fun, you know?

20:16.692 --> 20:19.934
I don't know how it happened, but six hours every day.

20:19.954 --> 20:21.395
It went by in no time.

20:21.595 --> 20:21.996
Right!

20:22.056 --> 20:25.078
Yeah, we did all our shifts too!

20:25.298 --> 20:28.480
But by the end of it, we were really sad that it had

20:29.761 --> 20:31.603
It was legendary, right?

20:31.703 --> 20:36.928
We feel so honored to have been a part!

20:36.968 --> 20:37.909
But it's sort of funny.

20:37.929 --> 20:40.992
I already feel nostalgic now somehow.

20:41.012 --> 20:43.915
You watched all the TV show!

20:44.755 --> 20:46.417
We were the best doctors!

20:50.841 --> 20:55.965
But you know the event, because you know it was with a JP-senpai and everything too.

20:56.285 --> 20:58.507
The event was mainly in Japanese.

20:58.567 --> 21:04.072
But we had Pero TL helping us translate the whole 7 day event live!

21:04.532 --> 21:08.595
So please check out the archives if you weren't able to join us in the moment.

21:08.635 --> 21:12.699
You know it was pretty crazy when it comes to different time zones and everything too.

21:12.899 --> 21:14.180
So please check out

21:15.460 --> 21:17.021
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:17.141 --> 21:18.701
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:18.721 --> 21:20.762
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:44.590 --> 21:47.841
It's hard to pick a favorite while we keep on going.

21:47.861 --> 21:49.024
What's your favorite moment?

21:50.324 --> 21:58.346
I don't think we can really say it, but we picked some of our very special photos that we got to take during our time in Holosan for us.

21:59.587 --> 22:03.848
This isn't from our perspective, but I think it's one of our favorite moments.

22:04.228 --> 22:09.730
It's a bit of a spoiler, so if you don't want to know how the story ends, look away for now.

22:10.470 --> 22:11.570
Turn off your headphones.

22:13.031 --> 22:13.371
But!

22:13.391 --> 22:14.331
Yeah.

22:14.911 --> 22:15.611
This moment.

22:16.152 --> 22:16.572
You know.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.472
Wow.

22:18.530 --> 22:19.471
I don't know!

22:19.991 --> 22:20.851
Ruffians!

22:21.252 --> 22:24.373
The three ended with that wedding!

22:24.393 --> 22:29.916
You'd think that it was all scripted or something, but it was all live!

22:30.257 --> 22:31.918
Just happening right then!

22:32.238 --> 22:34.579
Coincidence after coincidence!

22:35.560 --> 22:37.301
It was amazing!

22:37.441 --> 22:39.762
Amazing wedding!

22:40.582 --> 22:41.263
I don't know...

22:42.865 --> 22:44.026
What a clean shot.

22:44.146 --> 22:45.367
Yeah.

22:45.748 --> 22:47.109
It was so good.

22:47.189 --> 22:52.214
If you haven't been able to check it out, please find out why this happened.

22:53.275 --> 22:54.977
The events leading up to it.

22:55.537 --> 23:05.286
Yeah, and I think, you know, if you check out a clip from HoloGT, maybe sometimes it might be hard not to hear Fubuki-sensei being FUWAMOCO!

23:07.500 --> 23:08.901
We had a lot of fun, right?

23:09.001 --> 23:09.121
Yeah!

23:09.201 --> 23:12.323
And you know, there's a bunch of different moments, you know?

23:12.404 --> 23:12.704
Yeah!

23:12.724 --> 23:16.607
As in our... Sort of explosive... Ambulance!

23:16.647 --> 23:17.187
Yeah!

23:17.267 --> 23:17.847
I know, yeah.

23:17.867 --> 23:19.909
Gotta get to the scene as fast as you can.

23:19.929 --> 23:21.190
And a couple incidents.

23:21.490 --> 23:27.114
Yeah, sometimes you get back to the hospital so fast that the patient's no longer with you.

23:27.234 --> 23:28.755
They're missing from your car.

23:29.035 --> 23:30.657
That happened a couple times, huh?

23:31.077 --> 23:31.817
A couple times?

23:31.997 --> 23:32.418
Yeah.

23:33.374 --> 23:35.235
This normal stuff.

23:35.535 --> 23:37.477
We told them to wear their seatbelts!

23:37.517 --> 23:39.117
We did every time!

23:39.137 --> 23:40.979
We can't be helpful.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.840
We can't help them if they don't wear their seatbelts.

23:42.860 --> 23:45.381
Can't help them anymore than saying, put your seatbelt on.

23:45.421 --> 23:47.542
Ruffians, I think you should know now.

23:48.203 --> 23:49.303
Put your seatbelt on!

23:50.504 --> 23:50.864
Got it?

23:51.125 --> 23:51.505
Yeah.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.265
Yeah.

23:52.846 --> 24:00.090
Did you like it?

24:00.750 --> 24:02.711
I liked our dog.

24:03.192 --> 24:03.832
I liked it!

24:03.872 --> 24:06.393
It was a challenge getting up the stairs.

24:06.493 --> 24:08.194
It was a challenge in general!

24:08.214 --> 24:10.736
Definitely didn't want anyone over.

24:12.968 --> 24:13.829
We were smiling.

24:13.969 --> 24:14.509
Yeah.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.452
Smiling so much there was red all over the road.

24:17.773 --> 24:18.233
Yeah.

24:18.273 --> 24:20.055
So much lipstick.

24:20.095 --> 24:20.575
Yeah.

24:21.356 --> 24:22.677
Yeah.

24:22.777 --> 24:26.220
It was fun and... I'm burger car!

24:26.461 --> 24:29.584
Ultimate car is a burger car!

24:29.644 --> 24:31.345
Does it count as a car?

24:31.846 --> 24:32.807
It counts as a car.

24:33.047 --> 24:35.429
Well, the honk button isn't a honk button.

24:35.449 --> 24:36.310
There's no honk.

24:36.510 --> 24:37.231
No what though?

24:42.175 --> 24:45.478
What if it had jets so it could do more than just jump?

24:47.720 --> 24:48.641
We'll never know!

24:48.721 --> 24:53.986
What if it could've done more than jump and just fly?

24:54.527 --> 24:54.887
Maybe?

24:56.630 --> 24:58.671
Yeah, it had a boost.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.032
And then Garibaldi appeared!

25:02.092 --> 25:03.832
Don't care about Garibaldi!

25:03.892 --> 25:06.753
You have to check it out, okay?

25:06.773 --> 25:09.794
Garibaldi doesn't get hit by... Nothing.

25:09.854 --> 25:10.014
Yeah.

25:12.597 --> 25:15.958
Make sure you check it out, okay?

25:16.078 --> 25:18.019
But it was just so much fun.

25:18.059 --> 25:22.060
We're really happy to be able to get to know our senpai.

25:22.500 --> 25:30.623
Also to have all of IAAN ID also included because you know it's really hard with multiple languages or language barriers.

25:30.643 --> 25:33.224
Especially knowing you have the police, the gang.

25:33.264 --> 25:35.745
You gotta hear some important instructions.

25:37.065 --> 25:41.346
Is there anyone watching FUWAMOCO Morning for the first time?

25:41.746 --> 25:42.326
Raise your hand!

25:42.346 --> 25:42.626
BAU BAU!

25:42.646 --> 25:43.507
There might be.

25:43.567 --> 25:44.027
Liar.

25:44.107 --> 25:44.287
Liar.

25:44.307 --> 25:44.447
Liar.

26:07.432 --> 26:08.372
FUWAMOCO!

26:08.452 --> 26:13.733
I see some new hands now!

26:13.813 --> 26:16.354
BAU BAU!

26:16.434 --> 26:19.694
Thank you and welcome!

26:20.575 --> 26:29.896
But you know, FUWAMOCO, whether in Holosantos or not, we'll continue to do our best to protect you so I am!

26:30.036 --> 26:32.337
And no ambulances included this time.

26:33.397 --> 26:33.657
No.

26:36.533 --> 26:39.097
I miss it.

26:39.277 --> 26:42.302
When I hear a clip and I hear the sounds down in my heart.

26:42.483 --> 26:45.388
We really are so honored to have been apart.

26:45.788 --> 26:46.550
I still don't get it.

26:46.570 --> 26:54.824
It feels a little bit like a dream.

26:55.304 --> 26:56.186
It's another week.

26:56.827 --> 26:58.350
Another week all of a sudden.

27:03.873 --> 27:08.174
Has it been a little bit of a struggle without FUWAMOCO Morning?

27:08.194 --> 27:12.275
Do you need maybe a little bit of a Pup Talk?

27:12.295 --> 27:17.096
Moco-chan, is there some words you could give us today?

27:17.116 --> 27:24.877
Ruffians!

27:26.817 --> 27:27.457
Do you know?

27:27.477 --> 27:29.898
Do you know it's back?

27:31.695 --> 27:32.516
Yeah!

27:32.956 --> 27:36.779
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

27:37.399 --> 27:39.601
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

27:40.061 --> 27:41.142
Mococo!

27:42.423 --> 27:43.003
Ruffians!

27:44.004 --> 27:46.225
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

27:48.967 --> 27:49.688
Did you miss it?

27:52.650 --> 27:58.636
Well, you know, sometimes it's good to take a small break and then get back into your regular groove, you know?

27:58.656 --> 28:06.543
We had fun in Holosantos together, but you know, it's also important to treasure our regular everyday as well.

28:07.965 --> 28:15.292
So, let's all try to keep ourselves in tip-top shape and also try to do something that's a bit scary.

28:15.972 --> 28:16.273
Maybe...

28:17.168 --> 28:17.709
Everyday.

28:17.729 --> 28:22.334
Cuz you never know what kind of amazing result you could have too.

28:22.354 --> 28:23.195
Yes!

28:25.358 --> 28:26.279
You can do it!

28:26.980 --> 28:28.562
Ganbatte de!

28:28.962 --> 28:29.743
BAU BAU!

28:31.033 --> 28:33.416
BAU BAU!

28:33.436 --> 28:37.760
Let's do it best Ruffians again!

28:38.441 --> 28:42.065
Let's take a look at some of the regular corners then!

28:42.626 --> 28:47.731
Today we have a brand new Doggie of the Day!

28:47.751 --> 28:52.916
Today's Doggie of the Day is De-den!

28:54.938 --> 28:55.258
Joey!

28:55.318 --> 28:56.899
Cute boy!

28:56.959 --> 28:57.440
Joey!

28:57.500 --> 29:00.001
Joey, you look so wise!

29:00.642 --> 29:01.462
I guess what?

29:01.562 --> 29:03.224
Tomorrow!

29:03.324 --> 29:08.067
Tomorrow is Joey's birthday!

29:08.167 --> 29:11.870
Happy birthday, Joey!

29:12.010 --> 29:13.070
Happy birthday!

29:13.090 --> 29:14.491
So cute fluffy!

29:14.511 --> 29:14.611
Right?

29:14.892 --> 29:15.452
Fluffy!

29:15.472 --> 29:18.174
This means you know now Joey's gonna be getting even wiser.

29:18.574 --> 29:21.296
That's a 10 out of 10 dog.

29:21.316 --> 29:24.779
Yeah, I think so too.

29:25.419 --> 29:26.840
Looks like Garibaldi.

29:28.261 --> 29:29.342
This is Jolie.

29:29.362 --> 29:31.344
This is Jolie, not Garibaldi.

29:31.724 --> 29:33.045
Not Husky Miku.

29:33.565 --> 29:34.246
Very different.

29:34.266 --> 29:35.347
This is Jolie.

29:35.627 --> 29:39.090
And tomorrow is Jolie's birthday, so happy birthday Jolie!

29:39.150 --> 29:41.792
BAU BAU!

29:42.272 --> 29:44.233
How does Jolie BAU BAU?

29:48.099 --> 29:48.981
Sounds wise?

29:49.001 --> 29:51.905
That's what I was going for.

30:00.888 --> 30:05.372
Well, Julie, thank you for being a fan of FUWAMOCO!

30:05.572 --> 30:06.472
Especially Mococo!

30:06.512 --> 30:07.693
BAU BAU!

30:08.254 --> 30:17.920
I'm gonna say make sure that you BAU BAU lots and not just when you see Moco-chan on the screen, okay?

30:17.940 --> 30:18.020
Okay!

30:18.461 --> 30:21.303
BAU BAU!

30:24.305 --> 30:25.586
I got that one.

30:25.666 --> 30:27.067
Not just when Pup Talks, okay?

30:30.488 --> 30:33.129
FUWAMOCO!

30:33.209 --> 30:38.891
Next we have our... Today I went on a walk with Ruffians!

30:39.131 --> 30:40.452
Mane-chan!

30:40.892 --> 30:47.154
Mane-chan wanted to let you know first that there's gonna be a spider in this next video.

30:47.734 --> 30:50.295
So if you don't like spiders, look away, okay?

30:51.655 --> 30:52.336
Let's take a look!

30:54.536 --> 30:54.697
Oh!

30:55.557 --> 30:55.677
Oh!

31:02.020 --> 31:07.764
Moco-chan!

31:07.784 --> 31:10.967
Mane-chan tried to save you, but Moco-chan messed it up.

31:11.167 --> 31:12.167
I messed it up!

31:12.248 --> 31:13.408
I messed it up!

31:13.448 --> 31:19.032
I messed it up!

31:19.192 --> 31:23.535
Well, let's take a look now that we already saw the funky spider.

31:23.555 --> 31:25.417
Okay, real spider.

31:25.437 --> 31:26.618
You gotta get ready, okay?

31:26.678 --> 31:27.678
Real spider now!

31:28.399 --> 31:29.780
Just now, you didn't see it before.

31:33.922 --> 31:37.124
Really funky but really cool, right?

31:38.004 --> 31:39.065
It's also kind of funny.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.646
It does look like a starfish but an angry one.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.248
A starfish I do not want on me.

31:44.268 --> 31:45.668
Really tastes like a starfish.

31:46.629 --> 31:48.250
I would think it tastes like a spider.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.089
I unfortunately have tasted that.

31:51.129 --> 31:52.969
Camerafolding with RTX On!

31:52.989 --> 31:53.209
Chuu!

31:54.610 --> 31:55.010
Chuu!

31:55.030 --> 31:56.170
Basically.

31:56.210 --> 31:56.790
Basically.

31:57.090 --> 31:58.431
Yeah, just a little.

31:58.451 --> 31:59.991
It's not good.

32:00.632 --> 32:01.572
Yeah, but you know.

32:01.672 --> 32:02.032
Yeah.

32:02.052 --> 32:04.453
Definitely crypto money, chan.

32:05.147 --> 32:09.430
Yeah, so it's just that good of a photo, you know?

32:10.010 --> 32:12.791
Yeah, but is it fluffy or fuzzy though?

32:12.811 --> 32:15.333
Let's decide together Moco-chan, okay?

32:16.033 --> 32:17.094
Okay.

32:17.114 --> 32:17.094
3, 2, 1.

32:18.315 --> 32:19.035
Fuzzy!

32:19.455 --> 32:21.096
Yeah, definitely fuzzy.

32:21.476 --> 32:22.177
Yeah.

32:22.237 --> 32:22.537
BAU BAU!

32:22.557 --> 32:27.100
Stay away from it though.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.701
I'm glad it didn't go on you.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.464
BAU BAU!

32:35.404 --> 32:38.605
And next we have a Question of the Day!

32:38.625 --> 32:41.347
Moco-chan don't mess this one up okay?

32:41.367 --> 32:45.609
We have a Question of the Day!

32:46.788 --> 32:48.588
De-den!

32:48.968 --> 32:51.929
What is Fuwawa's favorite Samuel character?

32:52.329 --> 32:55.590
What is Mococo's favorite Samuel character?

32:56.050 --> 32:58.470
Also, what are your favorite Pokemon?

32:58.490 --> 32:59.791
Please let us know!

32:59.911 --> 33:02.471
BAU BAU!

33:02.891 --> 33:03.851
Good question.

33:03.871 --> 33:05.632
No spiders this time.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.892
Oh, I see some good guesses.

33:07.912 --> 33:09.592
Fuwawa!

33:09.652 --> 33:12.013
My favorite Samuel character is...

33:13.073 --> 33:17.575
Has to be Pompompurin Oshinomobo!

33:17.995 --> 33:20.036
Yeah, that one's very cute.

33:20.277 --> 33:21.777
I like little twin stars.

33:22.017 --> 33:22.218
Yeah.

33:22.738 --> 33:24.979
Yeah, but Pompompurin's cute as well.

33:25.019 --> 33:27.940
Yeah, it's a really good vibe, but... Little twin stars!

33:27.960 --> 33:30.922
They can even say bad and their names in a sentence, Moco-chan.

33:30.962 --> 33:31.222
What?

33:32.988 --> 33:36.170
When did I do wrong?

33:36.390 --> 33:37.030
BAU BAU!

33:37.090 --> 33:41.512
It's not Sanrio, but we really like Pondylion too!

33:41.552 --> 33:42.853
The best mascot!

33:42.933 --> 33:43.894
Yeah!

33:44.214 --> 33:49.176
But Pondylion is Pon-de-ring Mister Donut's mascot.

33:49.196 --> 33:51.698
Yeah, we really like mascot characters.

33:52.418 --> 33:59.061
But as for Pokemon, there's so many good Pokemon, but I really like Leporeon.

33:59.121 --> 33:59.361
Yeah.

33:59.782 --> 34:00.242
Moco-chan.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.977
I like Alolan Raichu.

34:04.718 --> 34:06.261
But you don't like Fluffy, right?

34:07.342 --> 34:07.963
Not so much.

34:08.464 --> 34:08.984
Yeah.

34:09.986 --> 34:18.018
We're not gonna get too angry at Fluffy though because otherwise Fluffy's gonna get us back and that's gonna be scary.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.127
Right, Moco-chan?

34:22.167 --> 34:23.967
FUWAMOCO was scary last time, right?

34:24.047 --> 34:27.628
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

34:27.708 --> 34:30.488
I love and like you!

34:30.688 --> 34:32.929
BAU BAU!

34:32.949 --> 34:36.410
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for your submissions!

34:36.670 --> 34:43.771
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is always something that we make together, so thank you for being here with us!

34:43.991 --> 34:46.892
We're always looking forward to more doggy of a days!

34:47.572 --> 34:49.633
To be seeing the walks that you've been going on.

34:49.693 --> 34:50.994
Hopefully you don't see spiders.

34:51.034 --> 34:54.595
Maybe you might be seeing the change in color of the leaves soon.

34:55.296 --> 34:58.938
Hopefully no peril amongst those leaves, you know?

34:59.518 --> 35:01.279
So please let us know!

35:01.319 --> 35:05.201
You can use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

35:05.321 --> 35:06.621
Okay, Ruffians!

35:07.081 --> 35:07.502
BAU BAU!

35:08.382 --> 35:11.525
FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:11.665 --> 35:13.507
FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:13.587 --> 35:15.589
FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:15.629 --> 35:18.772
FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:27.520 --> 35:28.321
EDF!

35:28.721 --> 35:29.782
EDF!

35:30.482 --> 35:33.924
We played all together last week and we got pretty strong.

35:33.944 --> 35:39.467
Pretty good at defending the earth but not strong enough to have our senpai join us in game.

35:39.807 --> 35:47.271
So we're gonna go back and we're gonna see just how strong we can be with Advent plus hololive English senpai with me.

35:47.852 --> 35:48.772
BAU BAU!

35:48.812 --> 35:50.173
Please join us!

35:50.853 --> 35:53.054
And put a schedule!

35:53.934 --> 35:57.776
After that, on Tuesday we're playing a game called Urayama.

35:58.216 --> 36:02.418
Gonna go deep into the Japanese countryside.

36:02.438 --> 36:06.320
And we're gonna have some nice fun.

36:06.340 --> 36:09.501
I hope I don't see anything frightening.

36:09.541 --> 36:10.842
Not anything too frightening.

36:11.382 --> 36:13.303
My heart is sort of scary.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.344
We'll see how it goes.

36:18.364 --> 36:21.426
Hopefully, at the very least, it's beautiful!

36:22.266 --> 36:22.426
Yeah!

36:23.007 --> 36:23.807
I'm excited!

36:23.867 --> 36:30.031
We have FUWAMOCO Morning followed by Ame-senpai's Valve Game Marathon!

36:30.051 --> 36:30.251
Yeah!

36:30.371 --> 36:31.892
We're gonna be doing a Team Fortress 2.

36:31.952 --> 36:34.413
First time Team Fortress 2 for us!

36:34.934 --> 36:37.055
And then Garry's Mod together with everybody.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.296
Garry's Mod was so much fun!

36:38.396 --> 36:38.896
Yeah!

36:38.936 --> 36:41.397
And we played it for Myth's third anniversary too.

36:41.477 --> 36:41.818
It's funny.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.039
In case you don't know, it's like hide and seek.

36:44.199 --> 36:45.640
Yeah, it was really fun.

36:46.280 --> 36:50.184
And then on Saturday we're having our Rock n' Rawr Party!

36:50.284 --> 36:52.546
This is how we're gonna end our summer, Ruffians!

36:52.566 --> 36:54.567
This is the end of summer, okay?

36:54.647 --> 36:56.989
You know, get your water gun all loaded up.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.191
Some nice drinks on screen.

36:59.431 --> 37:00.933
And let's have a summer party, okay?

37:00.953 --> 37:01.914
Okay!

37:02.274 --> 37:03.255
BAU BAU!

37:04.236 --> 37:11.721
And then after that a homework day for us so we're gonna do our best to take a little bit of a moment to be able to get some more sleep and some more work done.

37:13.943 --> 37:16.105
BAU BAU!

37:16.125 --> 37:20.408
We're the Ruffians who are joining us to the archive today!

37:20.428 --> 37:23.871

Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:42.757 --> 37:49.079
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

We've!

38:22.304 --> 38:24.305
