00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:11.115
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:15.258
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:19.201
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:19.821
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:24.692
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.914
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:29.956
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:32.998
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:37.802
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.282 --> 00:05:39.383
Ruffians!

00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:44.667
Thank you for waking up for us and joining us today for our 103rd episode!

00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:45.027
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:48.990
Everything is normal.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.736
You just got up, but you just got up, okay?

00:05:58.797 --> 00:06:00.558
That's amazing.

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:06.581
But it's not normal because today's gonna be a good day that starts off on the right paw.

00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:09.323
I hope every day is a good day that starts off on the right paw.

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:11.565
But it's gonna be an extra special one.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.106
Extra special normal day!

00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:14.266
BAU BAU!

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:22.129
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.210
I see a lot of new Ruffians.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:33.512
I think maybe some will join us from... Five Nights at Freddy's!

00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:34.112
Is that it?

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:35.372
Five Nights at Freddy's?

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:37.053
From BAU BAU?

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:40.437
From Five Nights at Freddy's.

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:41.357
Did we say it?

00:06:42.397 --> 00:06:42.678
Yeah!

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:43.358
BAU BAU!

00:06:43.538 --> 00:06:45.919
BAU BAU!

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.680
It's about FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.401
No, it's your first time joining us.

00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.722
It wouldn't be good if you're confused right off the morning.

00:06:54.742 --> 00:07:02.225
Yeah, well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:03.145
A.K.A.

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:04.126
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:04.146 --> 00:07:05.266
Hosted by us!

00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:07.107
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:13.350
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.250
I'm sorry I'm busy laughing here.

00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:17.091
Why are you laughing, Moco-chan?

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:18.712
I'm used off the morning.

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:20.893
What does that mean?

00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:27.356
But, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:31.918
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:32.338 --> 00:07:34.279
BAU BAU!

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.822
Ah, we skipped natto one day!

00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:39.903
That's fine.

00:07:40.223 --> 00:07:41.104
No one will cry.

00:07:41.184 --> 00:07:43.325
No one will cry, Ruffians.

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:45.026
Ruffians, you could've cried, right?

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:45.607
Did we?

00:07:45.687 --> 00:07:47.908
Moco-chan, the Ruffians are crying!

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:49.849
Did we skip natto one day?

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:50.290
Really?

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.752
You see the natto coming out of their eyes right now!

00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:54.693
That's not healthy.

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.955
Maybe you should go to the doctor, huh?

00:07:58.455 --> 00:07:58.815
Huh?

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.817
BAU BAU!

00:08:01.577 --> 00:08:02.198
BAU BAU!

00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:03.819
You're happy for Moco-chan.

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:04.579
Thank you.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:15.106
Well, it's gonna be a good Wednesday, a good middle of the week.

00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:16.668
Moco-chan.

00:08:17.588 --> 00:08:18.769
Why are you making that noise?

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.130
It's up for this.

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:24.014
There's been another Pero Sighting!

00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:28.086
I don't know.

00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:31.049
Every time it's a bit of a downer.

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:34.712
But, maybe it's better to get the downers out of the way first.

00:08:34.772 --> 00:08:37.235
I feel like Pero's been kinda nice recently, you know?

00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:38.996
Not really getting in our way.

00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:40.538
Doing some nice things.

00:08:40.698 --> 00:08:41.158
Right!

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.381
Ruffians, don't we like Pero?

00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:44.822
Wait, I don't know.

00:08:45.182 --> 00:08:46.384
Let's see, Ruffians.

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:48.005
You say that right now, but...

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:52.557
De-den!

00:08:52.857 --> 00:08:56.840
These are the Warehouse Cards!

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.364
I have the Super Expo 2020 movie footage!

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:05.106
I'm really glad that you found some!

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:05.807
It's nice, huh?

00:09:05.827 --> 00:09:06.227
Yeah!

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.989
And you got our lovely senpai!

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:09.769
And Shiori!

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.212
You can't see her here, but... And me!

00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:13.552
BAU BAU!

00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:13.672
But...

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.491
It also looks like you got pero.

00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:29.633
But maybe... Is this Ruffian doesn't seem to mind?

00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:31.953
Are you sure?

00:09:31.973 --> 00:09:33.173
Are you sure?

00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:37.694
You didn't feel like, ah, this is awful.

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:41.335
Anyone else would have been better, right?

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:42.596
Really?

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:43.856
Really, really?

00:09:45.358 --> 00:09:47.979
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:23.116
What about Mococo?

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:28.739
What about Nerissa, ha, Moco-chan?

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:31.621
Here's a bonerissa.

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:32.662
I can't bonerissa.

00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:45.669
Wow.

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:48.851
We're glad that you had amazing gacha luck.

00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:50.713
No, Moco-chan, but Pero, I guess that's okay.

00:10:51.093 --> 00:10:54.196
And we hope it continues forever and ever, right?

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:56.418
Right, Moco-chan?

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:58.800
Okay.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.743
Yeah, because that means that this Mofi will then get Moco-chan, too!

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.124
That's what I was thinking.

00:11:04.144 --> 00:11:04.485
Yeah.

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.347
BAU BAU!

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.768
I guess it's good that you got Pero.

00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:09.589
That makes you happy.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.210
BAU BAU.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.471
Forget Nerissa.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:12.732
BAU BAU!

00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:19.392
Well, Ruffians!

00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:28.502
We might kind of have a bit of an apology to make.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:33.807
Ruffians, we're really, really sorry.

00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:37.894
Did you know?

00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:38.815
Did you notice?

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:49.161
Maybe there's some Ruffians here that didn't notice, but actually, for the first time ever ever, we had to cancel a FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.942
And very suddenly too.

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:51.822
Very suddenly.

00:11:52.162 --> 00:11:53.443
Up until now, you know.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.884
A couple hours beforehand.

00:11:54.904 --> 00:11:56.105
A few hours, yeah.

00:11:56.405 --> 00:12:01.808
But up until now, you know, every single FUWAMOCO Morning, every single one since we debuted,

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:05.930
Every single one has happened until now.

00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.752
No oversleeping, no sickness.

00:12:09.373 --> 00:12:11.974
Every single one.

00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:13.355
We power through them all.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:14.936
But on Monday, we had to cancel.

00:12:21.244 --> 00:12:25.086
Ruffians, there was a really, really good reason though.

00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:28.748
So uh, thank you for understanding!

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:29.569
Yeah!

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:30.309
Yeah!

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:31.910
You see!

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.771
Wow, FUWAMOCO!

00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.173
It was a really crazy intense day!

00:12:37.193 --> 00:12:37.693
Crazy!

00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:38.754
FUWAMOCO!

00:12:39.054 --> 00:12:41.695
We have been up from early, early morning!

00:12:41.715 --> 00:12:42.796
Really, really early.

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:42.956
Yeah.

00:12:43.176 --> 00:12:46.058
Until late night working so hard!

00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:47.078
Like dogs!

00:12:47.198 --> 00:12:47.899
Like dogs!

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:49.860
Like dogs and dogs and dogs.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.123
We're working hard all together with all of Advent too!

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:15.438
Despite being super tired puppies, you know, we're like, okay, yep, we're going to do a FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:16.058
Of course!

00:13:16.138 --> 00:13:19.721
As always, you know, because we wanted to make sure to start the week off.

00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:20.762
That's what we had planned.

00:13:20.782 --> 00:13:22.723
Yeah, on the right paw together with you.

00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:25.665
That's what we had planned.

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.667
You know, we even haven't had dinner.

00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:28.147
Yeah.

00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:31.250
And Nerissa and Biboo are gonna go out to get something yummy.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.951
And we said no.

00:13:33.743 --> 00:13:38.409
Like we've done many times before, you know.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.113
We have an important engagement with the Ruffians, right?

00:13:42.193 --> 00:13:43.455
But then... Actually...

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.811
Suisei-senpai came in!

00:13:50.911 --> 00:13:54.415
BAU BAU!

00:13:54.575 --> 00:13:59.642
Those Suisei-senpais came in like a comet!

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:00.323
Like a comet!

00:14:01.124 --> 00:14:05.730
And it was our first time meeting Suisei-senpai and we were so surprised!

00:14:10.087 --> 00:14:10.807
Yeah.

00:14:11.547 --> 00:14:18.209
Suisei-senpai, she asked what our plans were because our busy day was now over.

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:18.769
Yeah.

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:21.869
And we said, you know, we have FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:24.250
You know, that's what we have planned.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.150
That's what we are gonna do.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:32.992
But then she was like, oh, FUWAMOCO, you'll come to Yakiniku with all of us, right?

00:14:33.252 --> 00:14:33.912
Right.

00:14:34.912 --> 00:14:38.376
And Ruffians... We knew what we had to do.

00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:48.286
You know, because if THE Suisei Senpai... THE Suisei Senpai... If she asks you to dinner, what do you say, Ruffians?

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:51.669
Are you gonna ignore a comment?

00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:52.770
You can't do that.

00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:53.351
Huh?

00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:54.092
Yeah.

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:55.740
Yes.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.801
Yes.

00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:57.141
Yes.

00:15:12.058 --> 00:15:18.821
Yeah, we're so excited, so nervous, but really, really, really happy to have dinner with her, you know.

00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:19.322
Yeah!

00:15:19.342 --> 00:15:23.484
FUWAMOCO, we really respect and admire Senpai so much.

00:15:23.584 --> 00:15:24.064
Of course.

00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:30.727
And we're really happy to be able to have the opportunity to ask her a bunch of questions!

00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:33.309
So many questions, always!

00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:36.010
We got a lot of Senpai power from her.

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:43.294
I was sitting directly across from Suisei-senpai!

00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:52.720
And every time she cooked a piece of meat for me and put it on my plate, I felt like I was gonna cry, Ruffians!

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.743
You were crying, right?

00:15:56.783 --> 00:15:58.664
Suisei-senpai BAU BAU!

00:15:58.964 --> 00:16:00.165
This isn't the time for that!

00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:07.489
FUWAMOCO, maybe we're not the best at yakiniku.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.131
We're probably not the best people to invite to yakiniku.

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:11.632
Because I...

00:16:12.935 --> 00:16:13.675
We scream.

00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:16.776
We're babies when it comes to yakiniku.

00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:18.196
We don't know what to do.

00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:20.056
And the fire is scary.

00:16:22.177 --> 00:16:24.337
So we scream and we can't control ourselves.

00:16:24.857 --> 00:16:26.858
Suisei-senpai was laughing at us.

00:16:29.998 --> 00:16:33.939
It's not like we were forced to go to dinner with Dai-senpai.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.340
We wanted to go, you know?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:37.960
Of course.

00:16:38.462 --> 00:16:38.802
Hi.

00:16:39.142 --> 00:16:48.427
And you know, it's not like there's ever gonna be another chance when we can go out to dinner with Nerissa and Biboo and Suisei-senpai!

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:48.827
Yeah.

00:16:48.847 --> 00:16:49.827
It's very slim.

00:16:49.887 --> 00:16:50.888
Yeah.

00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:52.088
It felt like a dream.

00:16:52.329 --> 00:16:55.090
Yeah, and we wanted to take the opportunity too!

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:55.370
Yeah!

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.612
You know, cause Suisei-senpai is very, very pretty too, right?

00:16:59.632 --> 00:16:59.812
Yeah.

00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:01.713
We hope you understand, Ruffians!

00:17:02.173 --> 00:17:04.874
You know, it wasn't a decision that we made lightly.

00:17:04.894 --> 00:17:04.934
No.

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:05.335
Uh-uh.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:05.495
No.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:14.968
Yeah, but we were just, we were really really happy because we were able to share with Suisei-senpai just how hungry we were!

00:17:15.028 --> 00:17:17.230
But, but, not in the yakiniku way.

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.432
In the ambitious sort of way.

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:20.393
Ambitious way.

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:22.595
Yeah, but we weren't hungry afterwards.

00:17:23.696 --> 00:17:25.537
We were, no, we were done.

00:17:26.037 --> 00:17:31.259
But Suisei-senpai also said that she'll be cheering us on too!

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:33.680
And you know what?

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.542
Nerissa and Biboo and I were actually laughing to each other.

00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:48.687
Because when we were walking back, Fuwawa and Suisei-senpai were walking together, and Nerissa was like, oh, it looks like they're on a date together, huh?

00:17:53.662 --> 00:17:57.804
I was trying to be the coolest demon dog I could be a Ruffian.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.586
Although I wasn't looking very cool at the time.

00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:04.007
You're probably looking like a big ball of mess.

00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:06.148
I'm very sweaty.

00:18:06.508 --> 00:18:09.970
Comments are hot, yo.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:16.253
Thank you Suisei-senpai for treating us to delicious yakiniku!

00:18:16.653 --> 00:18:20.175
And for giving us lots of amazing advice and support!

00:18:20.775 --> 00:18:22.096
Thank you!

00:18:22.256 --> 00:18:23.817
Arigatou!

00:18:24.077 --> 00:18:32.843
That one day, maybe FUWAMOCO, we can become amazing members of hololive just like our Suisei-senpai is too.

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:35.905
BAU BAU!

00:18:36.045 --> 00:18:37.166
Ruffians!

00:18:37.726 --> 00:18:38.546
You understand?

00:18:40.928 --> 00:18:41.528
Understandable.

00:18:42.709 --> 00:18:43.329
Understandable?

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.470
BAU BAU!

00:18:49.690 --> 00:19:03.317
Speaking of dreams, over the weekend I had a really funny dream that there was a new generation of hololive English called Justice that debuted!

00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:19.091
I think there was... It wasn't a dream, Moco-chan!

00:19:19.232 --> 00:19:21.693
I think there was... Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

00:19:22.134 --> 00:19:24.515
Yeah, over the weekend!

00:19:24.576 --> 00:19:27.077
The newest generation of hololive English!

00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:28.739
Justice!

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.240
Made their debut!

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.923
We have Bijou and Senpai!

00:19:34.983 --> 00:19:36.224
Crazy dream, right?

00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:42.609
It was so, so nice to see them debut and get cool!

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.891
The love to be held now and then!

00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:48.811
Then Cecilia!

00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:50.971
And then Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame!

00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:55.052
And then Gigi!

00:19:55.132 --> 00:20:00.213
It was nice that, you know, all of Advent, we were able to do a off-cloud watch-a-wee-ya!

00:20:00.253 --> 00:20:03.754
And I gave you those from the studio!

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:06.054
And it was really, it was just so nice.

00:20:06.134 --> 00:20:08.255
It was really cute to see them do their best.

00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:11.136
Debuting, remembering, that was us not too long ago.

00:20:11.156 --> 00:20:13.376
Yeah, it made us all a bit nostalgic, huh?

00:20:13.596 --> 00:20:16.077
Yeah, this... This FUWAMOCO Senpai!

00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:17.397
Yeah, this FUWAMOCO!

00:20:17.457 --> 00:20:22.559
I was feeling like a... a very, uh... mature puppy at that moment.

00:20:22.939 --> 00:20:24.159
Yeah.

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:24.900
You know?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.100
FUWAMOCO's right!

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.401
It was just so much fun cheering them on!

00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:29.641
Yeah!

00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:33.402
But, uh... We're definitely not gonna let them catch us, you know?

00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:35.883
But, you know, it needs to be said!

00:20:36.163 --> 00:20:36.663
But, but...

00:20:37.243 --> 00:20:37.804
Yeah, just like that.

00:20:37.824 --> 00:20:37.944
Yeah.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.883
That's a senpai's job, right?

00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:04.265
Good senpai behavior!

00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:05.787
Exactly!

00:21:05.907 --> 00:21:09.189
They've already got to see so much of their personalities.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.429
Right?

00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:12.471
And they released an amazing original song too.

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:15.693
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:19.635
Yeah!

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:23.437
And, you know, Elizabeth's already done a bunch of karaoke!

00:21:23.477 --> 00:21:23.937
Right!

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:25.938
But, I was really curious!

00:21:26.158 --> 00:21:26.418
Huh?

00:21:26.538 --> 00:21:33.240
I wanna see, you know, I wanna see Elizabeth- She did a really good Advent impersonation in BAU BAU.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.162
But, I haven't seen a Pero impersonation, right?

00:21:37.242 --> 00:21:37.982
We don't need that.

00:21:38.482 --> 00:21:39.242
He's nasty.

00:21:39.822 --> 00:21:43.724
I wanna see Elizabeth's Pero impersonation, right, Ruffians?

00:21:45.244 --> 00:21:45.644
Right!

00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:46.725
Hmm...

00:21:48.334 --> 00:21:49.515
Biboo did that!

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.137
I wanna see.

00:21:51.297 --> 00:21:52.177
Biboo did that!

00:21:52.398 --> 00:21:55.460
Which one is it?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.121
Cecilia too, you know?

00:21:57.141 --> 00:21:59.283
We made plans to rip off her head, right?

00:21:59.343 --> 00:22:00.984
Yes, we did make plans for that.

00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:04.888
After we rip off her head... And I had to rub our fingers on her joints.

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:06.129
That too, I guess.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:13.414
But you know, I thought it'd be fun that after we try ripping off her head, then we could drink tea together and see how that goes.

00:22:14.415 --> 00:22:14.856
Right!

00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:16.437
Where would it go, huh?

00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:17.999
I don't know, we have to see!

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:18.800
We have to try!

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.320
Right!

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.163
Alright!

00:22:23.284 --> 00:22:25.066
I could try something, Moco-chan.

00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:29.931
Cecilia could take a drink from the tea.

00:22:30.651 --> 00:22:33.715
And then we could see if it falls out of the neck.

00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:35.917
Then maybe we could drink from that.

00:22:38.616 --> 00:22:39.719
Wait, Ruffians!

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.003
It's an idea!

00:22:41.023 --> 00:22:41.645
Yeah!

00:22:41.926 --> 00:22:42.748
An idea!

00:22:42.768 --> 00:22:43.009
Right!

00:22:47.913 --> 00:22:52.016
FUWAMOCO It's an idea!

00:22:52.056 --> 00:22:52.637
Moco-chan.

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:19.457
I don't know.

00:23:19.477 --> 00:23:19.577
Maybe.

00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:25.721
You know, you power up a bit if you got some of Gigi's grammar power.

00:23:26.522 --> 00:23:27.842
I wonder how I can do that.

00:23:27.882 --> 00:23:31.745
Maybe you could just take a finger off of her something.

00:23:32.045 --> 00:23:32.605
Just a bite.

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:33.526
Yeah.

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:35.467
BAU BAU!

00:23:35.507 --> 00:23:36.548
We're good senpai, right?

00:23:36.608 --> 00:23:38.089
Thank you!

00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:38.869
I'm happy!

00:23:38.929 --> 00:23:39.630
Welcome Justin!

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:39.930
BAU BAU!

00:23:45.273 --> 00:23:47.834
It's been exciting, huh, Ruffians?

00:23:47.934 --> 00:23:49.715
It's been very exciting, yeah.

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:51.595
Just take a yobi yobi.

00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:52.516
BAU BAU!

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:57.458
On the topic of... Moco-chan!

00:23:57.558 --> 00:24:00.920
On the topic of exciting!

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.242
I thought we were on the topic of figs.

00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:07.423
No, no, no, no!

00:24:07.523 --> 00:24:09.283
This is on the topic of figs!

00:24:09.363 --> 00:24:10.744
Figs!

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.765
Ruffians, we had some amazing

00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:18.549
We're so happy to let you know, but FUWAMOCO!

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:25.814
We're gonna be special guests at Good Smile Company's panel at Anime Expo!

00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:27.235
BAU BAU!

00:24:27.295 --> 00:24:28.275
BAU BAU!

00:24:28.415 --> 00:24:29.476
BAU BAU!

00:24:29.516 --> 00:24:30.056
BAU BAU!

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.302
Are you going to be there, Ruffians?

00:24:38.662 --> 00:24:41.484
Maybe you had some fun summer plans in LA?

00:24:41.504 --> 00:24:45.487
If you did, maybe we'll see you there!

00:24:45.807 --> 00:24:48.369
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:54.894
We are so, so incredibly honored and just absolutely thrilled to be a part of this.

00:24:54.914 --> 00:24:56.935
You know how much we love figures, right?

00:24:59.777 --> 00:25:07.061
FUWAMOCO, since we've been small little puppies, we've actually been collecting figures, and we love them so much!

00:25:07.181 --> 00:25:11.563
And Good Smiles figures have been a very special part of our collection.

00:25:12.064 --> 00:25:21.209
Even FUWAMOCO, we remember looking at the very first Nendoroid to come out, together with the mama puppy, and we were like, oh they're so cute!

00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:23.450
So we collect them all!

00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:29.459
We decided to only get our very favorite characters.

00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:31.221
Which is a good decision.

00:25:31.241 --> 00:25:32.863
Yeah, good decision.

00:25:33.043 --> 00:25:33.664
There's over 2,000!

00:25:33.884 --> 00:25:36.307
2,000 Nendoroids!

00:25:37.048 --> 00:25:37.528
Yeah.

00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:38.289
A good decision.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.951
Good decision.

00:25:40.912 --> 00:25:43.656
Yeah, I don't have a big enough doghouse for that many Nendoroids.

00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:44.877
No, that's a lot of space.

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:45.478
Yeah.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:58.429
But we'll be on the panel together with YAGOO-san himself and the founder of Good Smile Company, Takanori Aki!

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.092
We're super novice Ruffians!

00:26:01.132 --> 00:26:02.133
What are we gonna do?

00:26:02.553 --> 00:26:06.897
What should we do to be able to share our love for figures even more, Ruffians?

00:26:08.838 --> 00:26:09.859
What are we gonna do?

00:26:10.139 --> 00:26:11.240
What are we gonna say?

00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:16.385
We can, you know... I think we're gonna say a bit more than that.

00:26:16.405 --> 00:26:21.169
FUWAMOCO, what's your thoughts on this?

00:26:21.189 --> 00:26:24.892
That's it, that's it.

00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:27.134
I think we gotta do better than that.

00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:31.578
So we're gonna do our best, okay?

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:34.101
I'll talk about your version and on.

00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:34.541
What?

00:26:38.324 --> 00:26:40.525
I know that the rarest nendoroid is Ryofuko-chan.

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:42.226
I wanted it.

00:26:42.987 --> 00:26:44.808
It's really cute.

00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:46.309
And I like the opening theme.

00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:47.469
It's not gonna happen.

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:48.370
Never gonna happen.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.111
But I think we have number 37.

00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:51.152
Hostile Inc.

00:26:58.914 --> 00:27:00.675
Tell them about your collection.

00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:03.776
I don't know if it's the right time for that.

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:11.298
Yeah, but there's gonna be announcements and prizes, so Ruffians, please don't forget about it, okay?

00:27:11.678 --> 00:27:17.759
We hope that you'll be cheering on these geeky puppies that are in FUWAMOCO one-to-one.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.560
You love too much, though.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.646
Since we're making our first appearance at Anime Expo, okay?

00:27:24.607 --> 00:27:26.390
BAU BAU!

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.676
Let's all show our power together, okay?

00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:30.878
BAU BAU!

00:27:33.083 --> 00:27:35.064
Breaking Dimensions!

00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:36.225
BAU BAU!

00:27:36.546 --> 00:27:49.575
hololive English's second concert, Breaking Dimensions, is happening in August.

00:27:49.695 --> 00:27:50.375
August 24th and 25th.

00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:55.078
Anyways, we just announced that there's gonna be some guests!

00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:58.700
First we have Kobo-senpai announced!

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.981
And now Muna-senpai!

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:04.022
And there's two more interesting shapes here.

00:28:04.042 --> 00:28:06.424
Oh, this shape's called senpai.

00:28:06.904 --> 00:28:08.305
Senpai shapes.

00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:10.005
Who do you think these senpai shapes are?

00:28:10.286 --> 00:28:10.946
Ruffians!

00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:13.467
Two more?

00:28:13.607 --> 00:28:14.688
Lump and Lumpy.

00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:16.096
Lumpy lumpy.

00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:18.858
A slime.

00:28:18.898 --> 00:28:20.179
Yes, a slime.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.120
Pero!

00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:23.462
I don't think it's Pero.

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:26.644
Why would anyone call him the guest on anything, huh?

00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:30.808
Well, I heard YMCA is Pero's favorite song to sing, right?

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:32.110
You don't want to see that?

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:32.930
I don't know.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.112
That would break too many dimensions, okay?

00:28:35.152 --> 00:28:36.773
That's true.

00:28:36.793 --> 00:28:42.157
Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll find out soon who these two muffy senpai shapes are.

00:28:43.037 --> 00:28:50.083
But, most importantly, Ruffians, you might have kind of let your guard down, but it's okay because these guard dogs, we have it for you.

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:51.163
I don't want that to happen.

00:28:51.203 --> 00:28:51.323
No.

00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:52.004
Yeah, the tickets that-

00:28:52.124 --> 00:29:03.894
In-venue in-person tickets for Breaking Dimensions goes on sale on Friday the 28th at 6pm PT, 9pm EDT, or the 29th 10am JST.

00:29:04.555 --> 00:29:05.356
Really soon!

00:29:05.436 --> 00:29:07.297
It's finally really soon!

00:29:07.338 --> 00:29:09.960
We'll remind you again next FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.103
Yeah, because we're super excited!

00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:13.264
It's gonna be a battle!

00:29:13.364 --> 00:29:13.885
Yeah!

00:29:13.945 --> 00:29:16.248
So you can't let your guard down!

00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:26.182
For Ruffians that are a little bit far away from the King's Theatre in New York, there are online digital streaming tickets available right now!

00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:26.662
Right now!

00:29:27.123 --> 00:29:31.346
Please go get them over on the SPW and on the Spawn website.

00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:37.050
Because FUWAMOCO will be making our first concert appearance there too!

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.131
Yes!

00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:38.751
Two days!

00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:40.652
Not one day, Moco-chan!

00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:41.413
Two days!

00:29:47.618 --> 00:29:59.268
And Ruffians, if you thought you know that this is an amazing concert, I gotta get a t-shirt, I gotta get some merch, right now you can still get your merch set on the official hololive website.

00:29:59.808 --> 00:30:03.992
It's actually extended, so if you're a little forgetful, it's okay, it happens.

00:30:05.212 --> 00:30:07.674
You can still get it, but there is some unfortunate news.

00:30:07.914 --> 00:30:10.195
The sets only come with one penlight.

00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:15.719
So that means, you know, that maybe you might need two penlights.

00:30:15.959 --> 00:30:19.621
Yeah, you might need to snag a friend's penlight.

00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:21.742
Excuse me, I would like to borrow that there.

00:30:21.942 --> 00:30:23.463
Buy two sets.

00:30:23.663 --> 00:30:25.625
Or you could always make your own penlight.

00:30:26.445 --> 00:30:29.246
We are alright.

00:30:29.546 --> 00:30:30.647
Lots of ideas!

00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:33.188
You can't have blue and pink at the same time.

00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:34.428
You need two.

00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:35.289
Okay.

00:30:36.329 --> 00:30:40.010
There's still some time to figure out what to do with the dilemma.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.151
Make your choices!

00:30:42.752 --> 00:30:47.193
We hope that you look forward to it just as much as we are, Ruffians!

00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:47.834
BAU BAU!

00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:57.687
Is this something exciting, Moco-chan?

00:30:57.707 --> 00:30:59.628
Is this something sad?

00:31:22.238 --> 00:31:25.200
Well, we have some news, Ruffians.

00:31:26.061 --> 00:31:27.101
Biboo was kidnapped.

00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:28.542
She was kidnapped.

00:31:28.582 --> 00:31:29.043
Kidnapped.

00:31:29.223 --> 00:31:30.724
Kidnapped for good this time.

00:31:31.184 --> 00:31:31.665
Yeah.

00:31:32.545 --> 00:31:33.066
Yeah.

00:31:33.246 --> 00:31:33.586
Yeah.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.527
I'm sorry that it's a bit alarming.

00:31:36.268 --> 00:31:36.728
Yeah.

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:37.609
She was kidnapped.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.392
Before Justice made their debut,

00:31:42.152 --> 00:31:45.314
Biboo was kidnapped by a group of criminals.

00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:47.976
Innocent criminals called Advent.

00:31:49.537 --> 00:31:53.880
We had to kidnap her away from the pebbles while she was playing Elden Ring.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.583
You know, cause she was having a lot of fun and then there was a let's in the boss.

00:31:58.743 --> 00:32:01.946
Yeah, you might not have heard it, but we broke down the door.

00:32:01.966 --> 00:32:03.066
We broke down the door.

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:04.967
We stormed the room!

00:32:04.987 --> 00:32:07.768
We stormed the room and told her, you have to get out!

00:32:08.028 --> 00:32:10.088
I'm gonna turn off the computer!

00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:10.508
Yeah.

00:32:10.588 --> 00:32:12.309
And we even tickled her, Ruffians.

00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:13.289
We even tickled her.

00:32:13.309 --> 00:32:13.389
Yeah.

00:32:13.649 --> 00:32:14.789
In a ticklish spot.

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.409
Yeah!

00:32:15.569 --> 00:32:17.530
And she... She was gaming.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.430
She did not react.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.450
She was a rock.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.170
She was a rock.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.311
Somehow that's surprising.

00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:22.411
Yeah.

00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:24.331
Yeah.

00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:27.492
I don't know, when Biboo's gaming, she is gaming.

00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:33.833
And, uh, I think Pebbles already realized this, but Biboo gaming is very cute.

00:32:36.295 --> 00:32:37.917
But she was also sweating a lot too.

00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:38.277
What?!

00:32:38.437 --> 00:32:41.580
But that might have had to do with the fact that she was getting kidnapped by Alphys.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:41.941
And tickled!

00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.422
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:43.542 --> 00:32:49.028
I did think, you know, I'm gonna pull the chair away but I decided that that's maybe a bit too cool.

00:32:49.188 --> 00:32:51.130
I know we talked about wanting to do that.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.191
She's almost done with the boss, so.

00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:53.511
Yeah.

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:54.072
But!

00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:55.053
We showed mercy.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:59.155
Just in time, Biboo was able to fell the hajim.

00:32:59.356 --> 00:33:01.817
And made it in time for Justice's debut.

00:33:01.837 --> 00:33:02.438
Yeah!

00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:03.458
Yeah.

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:09.703
But, uh, if you wanna hear what it sounds like for Abbot to kidnap Biboo, go check it out.

00:33:09.843 --> 00:33:10.363
BAU BAU!

00:33:19.257 --> 00:33:23.158
Ruffians, how has the week been going so far, huh?

00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:26.900
Hopefully you have some more energy.

00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:31.763
But maybe you need a little bit of a push too.

00:33:32.483 --> 00:33:34.064
Pick me up.

00:33:34.624 --> 00:33:37.605
Moco-chan, you're still sleepy.

00:33:37.986 --> 00:33:39.426
A bit rough.

00:33:40.147 --> 00:33:41.207
Tough but going.

00:33:41.487 --> 00:33:42.067
I get it.

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:42.868
It's been alright.

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.895
Could be better though, right?

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:48.638
Well, maybe you need a bit of a talk then!

00:33:48.658 --> 00:33:54.944
Ruffians!

00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:58.667
It's that time again!

00:33:58.687 --> 00:34:00.729
You're right!

00:34:01.589 --> 00:34:04.192
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:34:04.932 --> 00:34:07.354
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:08.095
Mococo!

00:34:12.182 --> 00:34:13.943
How are things going, Ruffians?

00:34:15.764 --> 00:34:21.248
You know, before we even realized it, it seems like we're in the thick of summer already!

00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:25.330
Are you keeping your energy levels up?

00:34:26.811 --> 00:34:29.473
You won't let the heat and the humidity zap at you, right?

00:34:30.533 --> 00:34:30.894
Right?

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:38.839
One thing that's important is that you make sure to keep yourself refreshed by not only just drinking water,

00:34:39.723 --> 00:34:43.006
But by keeping up with trying out new things every now and then too.

00:34:43.026 --> 00:34:45.087
You know?

00:34:46.128 --> 00:34:53.774
It's always a great feeling of accomplishment when you can give yourself a pat on the back after trying something that was, uh, maybe a bit scary.

00:34:53.794 --> 00:34:55.735
You know?

00:34:56.616 --> 00:34:57.517
I know you can do it.

00:34:58.698 --> 00:34:59.658
No matter what you think.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:00.999
You're strong!

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.280
It won't faze you.

00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:06.464
In the end, you'll be glad you tried and didn't regret it.

00:35:06.684 --> 00:35:07.945
No matter the outcome, okay?

00:35:08.892 --> 00:35:11.675
So, let's take control of this summer.

00:35:12.015 --> 00:35:15.438
This summer of Advent and say no!

00:35:16.339 --> 00:35:21.444
Actually, this is the summer of me!

00:35:22.785 --> 00:35:25.708
Let's all do our best to make it an unforgettable summer, okay?

00:35:26.629 --> 00:35:28.370
Ganbatte ne!

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.972
BAU BAU!

00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:31.473
BAU BAU!

00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:39.423
The summer of Advent and the summer of you, Ruffians!

00:35:39.443 --> 00:35:40.103
BAU BAU!

00:36:03.338 --> 00:36:03.538
Lady!

00:36:03.658 --> 00:36:04.119
Lady!

00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:06.120
So cute!

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.320
Lady!

00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:22.831
She's woofy!

00:36:23.232 --> 00:36:24.733
And has boobies!

00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:27.694
And has butt scrunchies!

00:36:28.235 --> 00:36:31.957
And adjustable anything that can fit in her mouth!

00:36:32.097 --> 00:36:32.918
And has donuts!

00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:34.079
And you know what?

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:35.760
I love Winnie!

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.844
Winnie, look at Winnie's eyes!

00:36:41.884 --> 00:36:43.084
That's a puppy!

00:36:43.264 --> 00:36:44.685
That's a puppy!

00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:46.386
Baby Fuwawa, excuse me!

00:36:47.702 --> 00:36:50.244
Little baby Mococo, hi!

00:36:50.344 --> 00:36:53.167
It's me, it's Moco-chan!

00:36:53.247 --> 00:36:53.367
Hi!

00:36:53.407 --> 00:36:53.987
Hi!

00:36:54.008 --> 00:36:56.350
BAU BAU!

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:01.114
I think Winnie, Winnie BAU BAU is like... BAU BAU!

00:37:01.514 --> 00:37:02.795
BAU BAU!

00:37:02.875 --> 00:37:04.917
BAU BAU!

00:37:04.997 --> 00:37:07.019
Winnie, Winnie.

00:37:07.379 --> 00:37:09.161
Winnie, you're too cute.

00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:10.662
Look at Winnie's ears.

00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:11.783
My ears are cuter though.

00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:16.908
BAU BAU!

00:37:16.948 --> 00:37:18.428
Can we give Winnie a ranking?

00:37:18.448 --> 00:37:19.749
A ranking?

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:20.329
A rating?

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.310
Ranking.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.991
My brain is broken.

00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:25.271
That's Winnie.

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:25.471
Winnie.

00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:26.452
Breaker of brains.

00:37:36.332 --> 00:37:36.732
That's it.

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.433
BAU BAU!

00:37:39.453 --> 00:37:46.496
And let's take a look at the work we've been going over for you.

00:37:46.716 --> 00:37:50.178
Today's work is... De-den!

00:37:50.218 --> 00:37:51.138
Mococo Sky!

00:37:51.198 --> 00:37:53.679
A FUWAMOCO colored sky above the snow.

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:54.580
A Mococo Sky!

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.581
No more white about Mococo, right?

00:37:56.761 --> 00:37:59.202
Yeah, it's a Moco-chan sky.

00:37:59.602 --> 00:38:01.723
Well, I hope you go home safe.

00:38:01.863 --> 00:38:04.304
I'm gonna assume you go home safe since you uploaded this.

00:38:06.126 --> 00:38:07.368
Twitter.

00:38:07.548 --> 00:38:09.350
I don't think a ghost can upload to Twitter, huh?

00:38:10.751 --> 00:38:18.074
Well, I'm glad that you know you got to see a beautiful sky to calm you down after what I'm sure was a very busy day.

00:38:18.174 --> 00:38:18.634
Right.

00:38:19.394 --> 00:38:21.815
BAU BAU!

00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:25.736
Time for our Question of the Day!

00:38:25.756 --> 00:38:26.856
We have de-den!

00:38:26.896 --> 00:38:30.718
Morning FUWAMOCO!

00:38:30.778 --> 00:38:31.718
Morning!

00:38:32.578 --> 00:38:33.459
BAU BAU!

00:38:33.799 --> 00:38:36.820
This question was in my mind for almost a year now!

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.901
How come as demon guard dogs,

00:38:40.261 --> 00:38:43.702
You decided to protect our smiles instead of steal them.

00:38:44.203 --> 00:38:45.483
Aren't demons evil?

00:38:45.503 --> 00:38:50.965
And we unintentionally sold our souls for this.

00:38:50.985 --> 00:38:53.506
That's a very cute illustration.

00:38:53.627 --> 00:38:56.528
A very accurate one of FUWAMOCO.

00:38:57.028 --> 00:39:06.912
But to answer your question, you know, sometimes, and this isn't everyone, but sometimes people don't want their smiles protected.

00:39:07.873 --> 00:39:12.155
So, you know, we try to ask, you know, is it okay if we protect your smile?

00:39:12.275 --> 00:39:12.896
We try.

00:39:12.916 --> 00:39:14.457
Is it okay to boil your smile?

00:39:14.517 --> 00:39:15.057
Try.

00:39:15.437 --> 00:39:22.762
But sometimes we do accidentally protect smiles even if you don't want it to be.

00:39:22.782 --> 00:39:23.162
Yeah.

00:39:23.983 --> 00:39:27.905
And some people think, you know, that's pretty demonic.

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:28.225
Right?

00:39:28.285 --> 00:39:28.446
Yeah.

00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:29.646
Right?

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.768
We're gonna protect your smile!

00:39:31.788 --> 00:39:33.649
We're gonna protect your smile!

00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:36.170
Whether you like it or not.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.931
We'll protect it, okay?

00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:40.631
Very demonic, right?

00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:44.872
Resistance is futile.

00:39:45.193 --> 00:39:47.893
We're FUWAMOCO!

00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:51.895
It's futile.

00:39:51.995 --> 00:39:52.395
Got it.

00:39:52.795 --> 00:39:54.295
That's why.

00:39:55.496 --> 00:39:57.476
That's why these puppies are demon-grinded.

00:39:57.516 --> 00:39:58.177
Got it.

00:39:59.673 --> 00:40:01.014
Yeah, we'll protect it.

00:40:01.474 --> 00:40:02.635
BAU BAU!

00:40:03.395 --> 00:40:04.136

00:40:04.336 --> 00:40:04.456
Hi!

00:40:04.556 --> 00:40:07.938
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:40:08.258 --> 00:40:08.539
Thank you!

00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:10.780
We're always looking for new submissions.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.562
Your puppy's very cute puppy winning today.

00:40:13.582 --> 00:40:13.682
Right.

00:40:14.382 --> 00:40:16.904
Your doggies, your questions.

00:40:17.684 --> 00:40:23.608
All of them, so please let us know what's on your mind with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:24.789

And for our next stream,

00:40:29.692 --> 00:40:32.373
We have... De-den!

00:40:32.853 --> 00:40:35.213
The game of sis wheels!

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:36.733
Yeah.

00:40:37.794 --> 00:40:39.874
We're gonna be rolling on a big rock each.

00:40:40.274 --> 00:40:42.195
One rock for me, one rock for you.

00:40:42.215 --> 00:40:42.755
And Mococo!

00:40:42.775 --> 00:40:44.355
We're not gonna have to share the rock.

00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:47.276
Because we're versusing each other!

00:40:47.696 --> 00:40:49.956
Yeah, sister versus sister.

00:40:49.996 --> 00:40:50.256
Yeah.

00:40:50.396 --> 00:40:51.636
Who is the strongest?

00:40:51.656 --> 00:40:52.137
Alright.

00:40:52.217 --> 00:40:53.677
Who can push it the farthest?

00:40:53.837 --> 00:40:54.017
Yeah.

00:40:54.637 --> 00:40:56.077
That's what we're gonna be doing.

00:40:56.557 --> 00:41:00.098
So Ruffians, we'll need you to kinda help us.

00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:02.518
Maybe let us know what to avoid.

00:41:02.778 --> 00:41:05.419
Let us know how to beat each other up.

00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:06.359
Yeah!

00:41:06.379 --> 00:41:07.599
Because we're gonna roll the rock.

00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:09.059
We'll find the ultimate winner.

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:09.660
Oh yeah.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.380

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.141

00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:20.861
After that, well, on Thursday we're playing Portal 2 together!

00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:22.282
Ah, cool!

00:41:22.422 --> 00:41:23.642
Cool, yeah!

00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:31.129
We've never played Portal before, but we've heard a lot of Ruffians suggesting FUWAMOCO, you should check it out!

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:36.734
And we're always interested in playing fun games, because all games are fun to play!

00:41:36.774 --> 00:41:40.838
So we're gonna do our best and see just how much fun Portal 2 is!

00:41:40.858 --> 00:41:41.739

00:41:41.759 --> 00:41:47.485
