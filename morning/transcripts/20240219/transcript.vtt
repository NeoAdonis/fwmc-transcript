05:08.550 --> 05:10.672
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.252 --> 05:14.815
It's time for... FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.835 --> 05:21.661
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.141 --> 05:23.663
BAU BAU!

05:23.963 --> 05:25.524
BAU BAU!

05:26.345 --> 05:27.546
BAU BAU!

05:28.246 --> 05:32.390
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm... BAU BAU!

05:36.013 --> 05:37.034
BAU BAU!

05:38.036 --> 05:38.341
Pfft.

05:40.681 --> 05:44.064
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:44.104 --> 05:46.085
BAU BAU!

05:46.826 --> 05:48.828
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:48.908 --> 05:51.289
BAU BAU BAU!

05:51.770 --> 05:56.433
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:56.854 --> 06:03.299
Thank you Ruffians for waking up bright and early and joining us today for our 82nd episode!

06:03.439 --> 06:03.859
BAU BAU!

06:09.203 --> 06:09.824
Hello!

06:09.844 --> 06:21.092
For Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

06:21.573 --> 06:24.895
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:24.915 --> 06:30.639
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:31.020 --> 06:36.044
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:36.764 --> 06:40.766
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:40.966 --> 06:43.127
BAU BAU!

06:43.487 --> 06:44.548
Are you still sleepy?

06:44.568 --> 06:44.608
Oh!

06:46.209 --> 06:47.169
Sleepy?

06:47.349 --> 06:47.630
Oh!

06:47.670 --> 06:49.510
Moco-chan do you have a cure for that?

06:50.471 --> 06:51.531
BAU BAU!

06:51.992 --> 06:53.352
BAU BAU!

06:54.053 --> 06:55.373
BAU BAU!

06:55.734 --> 06:58.255
BAU BAU... BAU BAU!

06:59.455 --> 07:01.356
Good now?

07:01.557 --> 07:02.217
You're good now.

07:02.881 --> 07:03.821
BAU BAU.

07:06.022 --> 07:11.603
Well, hopefully that's gotten the sleepy away a little bit of it.

07:11.803 --> 07:12.263
Yeah.

07:13.064 --> 07:13.664
You're awake.

07:14.344 --> 07:15.644
Moco-chan alive.

07:15.664 --> 07:18.665
Yeah.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.686
A good way to start off the brand new week is with a big BAU BAU.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.606
BAU BAU CANNON!

07:27.187 --> 07:28.067
Okay, Moco-chan.

07:32.483 --> 07:37.005
Well, I hope you're awake for the next part because, uh... Because?

07:37.025 --> 07:39.025
You might need your brain.

07:39.605 --> 07:40.246
Brain?

07:41.026 --> 07:41.746
Is it math?

07:43.127 --> 07:46.448
There was... another perosighting.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.188
And... That?

07:50.249 --> 07:54.430
I think... you're gonna need the help of your brain to process it a bit.

07:58.292 --> 07:58.572
What?

07:58.652 --> 07:59.372
What's happening?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.233
Don't be too surprised, okay?

08:01.393 --> 08:01.693
Huh?

08:03.204 --> 08:03.745
De-den!

08:03.765 --> 08:04.826
You're good Ruffians!

08:20.541 --> 08:24.064
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

08:35.732 --> 08:39.614
He's even cuter because he's taking down pets!

08:39.654 --> 08:43.436
He just realized how nasty he is to hawa Ruffians.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.498
What nice nature, yes!

08:47.518 --> 08:53.021
Do your best at that, giant millipede!

08:53.041 --> 08:54.281
Squeeze!

08:54.481 --> 08:57.743
Moco-chan, you like millipedes too.

08:57.863 --> 09:01.505
I think they're pretty cute and they're shiny.

09:01.665 --> 09:02.945
I think they just feel happy.

09:04.346 --> 09:08.211
I realize that some Ruffians might not like them first thing in the morning, huh?

09:08.231 --> 09:09.733
It's nature.

09:09.893 --> 09:10.313
Yeah.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.395
They're cute.

09:11.815 --> 09:12.356
And nice.

09:12.796 --> 09:14.118
Not like Pero.

09:14.398 --> 09:15.099
No.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.441
Yeah.

09:17.162 --> 09:20.186
But it kinda looks like they're wrestling, right?

09:20.426 --> 09:20.806
Right!

09:20.846 --> 09:21.307
Yeah!

09:21.647 --> 09:22.789
I sorta think that Pero

09:23.749 --> 09:26.272
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

09:26.332 --> 09:26.772
BAU BAU!

09:39.164 --> 09:40.825
Pero doesn't really have that.

09:40.965 --> 09:41.366
Hai.

09:41.646 --> 09:45.409
But it's kind of an even match, you know, Moco-chan, actually.

09:45.549 --> 09:45.869
Why?

09:46.409 --> 09:48.591
Because, you know, they're both round.

09:49.151 --> 09:51.593
And Mr. Millipede, he doesn't have any arms.

09:51.613 --> 09:53.394
He has, like, thousands of legs.

09:53.495 --> 09:53.935
Legs?

09:53.955 --> 09:57.177
I mean, Pero has wings.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.780
I don't know, I think the legs are better than arms.

10:03.358 --> 10:05.199
Why, Moco-chan, can you explain?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.179
Legs are better than wings!

10:07.879 --> 10:10.980
I think they have more strength to them.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.841
I guess you know, wrestling, you can't really fly.

10:13.861 --> 10:22.163
Unless you're gonna jump and then body slam, but I think that option's probably not that possible for Pero anymore.

10:22.283 --> 10:25.884
And you know, it's against the rules of wrestling to use your tongue, too.

10:27.812 --> 10:29.353
Don't think about that, okay?

10:29.393 --> 10:34.934
Well, Ruffians, I think we can kinda tell who's gonna win, huh?

10:35.034 --> 10:36.794
Good luck, Mr. Giant Ability!

10:37.214 --> 10:38.074
BAU BAU!

10:49.637 --> 10:54.059
Well, you know that if you go on a walk you could see something like that.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.801
A very fancy fight, huh?

10:56.861 --> 11:00.442
You never know what you're gonna see when you go for a walk, Ruffian.

11:01.663 --> 11:03.344
BAU BAU!

11:03.604 --> 11:05.385
Well, on a happier note!

11:06.065 --> 11:07.006
Ruffians!

11:07.146 --> 11:10.630
Last week we released a brand new cover song!

11:11.190 --> 11:15.795
We released a cover of Let Me Be With You from the anime Chobits!

11:15.955 --> 11:20.359
And you know, it's a song that's really special and filled with memories for us.

11:21.500 --> 11:34.444
You know, we are both really surprised because Chobits is now over 20 years old, but even then now, well, there's been a hundred thousand views!

11:34.504 --> 11:35.204
Thank you!

11:35.744 --> 11:38.365
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

11:38.745 --> 11:46.427
It really means a lot to us because, you know, like we kind of mentioned before, we don't really think it's gonna be the kind of cover song that, you know, gets

11:47.007 --> 11:49.069
Akitagawa Katsutoshi-san.

12:14.451 --> 12:16.372
He also retweeted our cover!

12:16.472 --> 12:17.233
Yeah!

12:17.293 --> 12:19.414
BAU BAU BAU!

12:19.494 --> 12:22.495
It makes us feel a little embarrassed about it.

12:22.535 --> 12:23.556
Me too!

12:23.816 --> 12:31.440
Anyways, we hope that, you know, it can help give you a bit of energy to get through the day by listening to it.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.721
A good start to the day!

12:32.741 --> 12:35.322
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:35.803 --> 12:39.284
BAU BAU BAU!

12:39.324 --> 12:43.247
Why are you like this?

12:46.545 --> 12:48.647
BAU BAU!

12:48.727 --> 12:49.548
Thank you!

12:49.928 --> 12:52.171
You know, Biboo at least let me be with you.

12:52.311 --> 12:56.976
And then Nerissa and Biboo, they released a cover of Otome Boy.

12:57.096 --> 12:59.618
But, well, Shiori, she also had

13:00.459 --> 13:02.722
Did you check it out Ruffians?

13:18.482 --> 13:21.886
Snowden, you know it's a slice of life visual novel where

13:35.160 --> 13:37.321
Wow, can you guess what happens?

13:38.382 --> 13:42.004
You get snowed in together with Shiori!

13:42.044 --> 13:47.647
Or you can go and download it for free from itch.io, so please go check it out!

13:47.847 --> 13:49.247
You know, I can't believe that!

13:49.608 --> 13:53.610
As Abyss members, we all like VNs so much!

13:53.830 --> 13:54.830
This is a marvel!

13:54.850 --> 13:56.831
It's so nice!

13:57.212 --> 13:57.492
You know,

13:58.132 --> 13:59.493
VNs are really fun though!

13:59.513 --> 14:00.233
Really fun!

14:00.354 --> 14:01.334
I don't know.

14:01.534 --> 14:05.557
It'd be so nice to do an Advent visual novel or something!

14:05.897 --> 14:06.237
You know.

14:06.758 --> 14:11.541
Especially since, you know, we did our VN style stream recently too for Valentine's Day!

14:12.001 --> 14:24.329
We had so many ideas, but... I don't know, Ruffians, you know, with our VN streams and everything... Afterwards, we're kind of thinking... Do we want to do another in the future?

14:25.089 --> 14:35.016
It takes a lot of work and I don't know, maybe we don't have enough ideas for new scenarios.

14:36.817 --> 14:39.019
But then, we realized.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.981
I know!

14:42.995 --> 14:46.756
We have almost endless ideas for scenarios.

14:46.816 --> 14:52.338
There's no problem, they're Ruffians, okay?

14:53.198 --> 14:56.379
It's a lot of work, but it's worth it because it's really fun.

14:56.399 --> 14:59.800
We're just endlessly silly high!

15:00.500 --> 15:05.902
I was like, Moco-chan, what about, you know... I don't know if we can do it again.

15:05.922 --> 15:08.082
And then I was like, oh wait, wait, what about that?

15:08.242 --> 15:08.602
Or that?

15:08.943 --> 15:09.483
Could do that.

15:10.043 --> 15:10.403
And that.

15:12.113 --> 15:17.016
I think we'll be okay, Ruffians, as long as you... I don't know!

15:17.076 --> 15:24.300
I said we're endlessly silly, but... Maybe the Ruffians are a bit silly or hot!

15:25.260 --> 15:30.784
Maybe... Well, hopefully we can meet even more in the future!

15:32.726 --> 15:38.448
We both really hope that you'll grow to love visual novels as much as I should!

15:38.608 --> 15:42.010
BAU BAU!

15:42.550 --> 15:47.172
It'd be nice if we could have like a visual novel book club together with Advent.

15:48.118 --> 15:54.583
Hello, Ruffians!

15:55.084 --> 15:56.625
As you know, it's Monday!

15:57.185 --> 15:59.027
It's the start of a new week.

15:59.467 --> 16:03.991
But there are even more milestones happening this week too!

16:04.772 --> 16:08.054
Last week we celebrated our 200 days since our debut.

16:10.596 --> 16:14.858
Together we have Moco-chan's 200th sneeze!

16:15.418 --> 16:18.639
And now today, we're celebrating 300 videos on the channel!

16:18.699 --> 16:20.520
That's just crazy!

16:20.620 --> 16:20.820
Really?

16:20.840 --> 16:21.800
300 videos!

16:21.860 --> 16:24.721
So then that's like two videos every day.

16:24.741 --> 16:25.101
No, that'd be 400.

16:25.221 --> 16:25.682
One and a half!

16:39.037 --> 16:40.518
Let's thank you!

16:40.558 --> 16:44.621
Thank you for always being here to have so much fun with us Ruffians.

16:44.701 --> 16:50.444
You know, it's hard to believe that in six months we've already done so much all together.

16:51.045 --> 16:55.988
But it also makes us really excited for what's waiting in the future too, hai!

16:56.328 --> 16:56.868
Hai!

16:56.948 --> 16:58.069
Hai!

16:59.090 --> 17:00.630
Mococo's so good at math!

17:01.091 --> 17:02.952
That's a nice compliment, Hamoko-chan.

17:03.712 --> 17:04.493
It's not hard.

17:05.934 --> 17:07.735
That type of math is not hard.

17:10.285 --> 17:17.930
Ruffians, you know, we just feel really, really happy so we wanted to share this accomplishment with you today.

17:18.430 --> 17:21.572
Let's go on to create even more together, okay?

17:22.132 --> 17:23.953
BAU BAU!

17:25.494 --> 17:27.275
Mococo the math genius.

17:28.235 --> 17:29.096
I don't know about that.

17:29.236 --> 17:30.036
And sneezer.

17:31.457 --> 17:32.277
It's connected.

17:32.297 --> 17:34.959
You sneeze more, do more math.

17:37.452 --> 17:37.872
Icy.

17:38.032 --> 17:38.932
That's where it comes from.

17:38.952 --> 17:39.332
Icy.

17:39.832 --> 17:40.433
BAU BAU!

17:40.553 --> 17:42.153
BAU BAU!

17:42.733 --> 17:46.235
Wow, Ruffians, it's also been some really cool news!

17:47.395 --> 17:48.175
I have a question.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.196
I know it's morning.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.157
Maybe this is not your preferred breakfast.

17:52.497 --> 17:55.938
But, Ruffians, do you like sushi?

17:56.038 --> 17:56.438
Sushi!

17:56.458 --> 17:58.259
Fish.

17:58.319 --> 18:00.959
Maybe no raw fish.

18:03.634 --> 18:08.817
Now is the chance!

18:09.037 --> 18:24.386
Well, if you haven't had sushi before, or if you happen to like sushi, this is perfect for you because a certain Same-senpai, well, she has something special going on at Sushiro Taiwan!

18:25.947 --> 18:27.448
BAU BAU!

18:27.748 --> 18:34.332
Right now, you know they have a special collab going on with Gura-senpai and it's super cute!

18:34.912 --> 18:46.638
If you go right now, you can not only get some really cute merch, look at the bottles and everything, but you can actually even see Gura-senpai there riding on the sushi conveyor belt!

18:46.678 --> 18:47.078
Right!

18:47.238 --> 18:49.579
I wanna see her go round and round!

18:51.580 --> 18:56.866
Yeah, I think it would be a really fun sushi dining experience.

18:56.946 --> 18:58.328
Are you pre-ordered?

19:00.670 --> 19:05.576
Ruffians, what's your favorite type of sushi?

19:05.856 --> 19:06.637
I feel like it's a...

19:08.100 --> 19:10.502
What's a hotly debated question?

19:10.522 --> 19:11.423
Ikura!

19:11.503 --> 19:12.003
Salmon!

19:12.083 --> 19:13.204
Tuna!

19:13.364 --> 19:14.685
Tuna!

19:14.745 --> 19:15.546
Tuna!

19:15.586 --> 19:15.926
Tuna!

19:15.986 --> 19:16.627
Tuna!

19:17.047 --> 19:17.528
Unagi!

19:17.688 --> 19:20.550
Wow, sophisticated!

19:21.130 --> 19:22.331
Tamago!

19:22.772 --> 19:25.634
I'm hungry now.

19:28.496 --> 19:29.517
I'm hungry.

19:29.577 --> 19:32.620
I feel like maybe Gura-senpai's favorite sushi.

19:34.454 --> 19:34.974
Ebi.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.915
But, maybe salmon.

19:38.015 --> 19:40.856
Everyone likes salmon, right?

19:41.617 --> 19:47.659
Everyone likes salmon, so... Ebi or salmon.

19:47.799 --> 19:52.781
Maybe, you know, if we go to Sushigura-senpai one day, we can find out.

19:52.801 --> 19:56.762
She could teach us what the most delicious fish in the sea is.

19:56.822 --> 19:57.543
More about them, huh?

19:59.123 --> 20:00.364
BAU BAU!

20:00.404 --> 20:03.526
Please check it out on K-Ruby!

20:04.026 --> 20:05.687
I like salmon too.

20:06.148 --> 20:06.928
It's so yummy.

20:07.308 --> 20:08.869
No tamago, thank you.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.131
That's not a fish, it's okay.

20:11.251 --> 20:11.791
BAU BAU!

20:13.052 --> 20:15.253
Wow, Ruffians!

20:18.914 --> 20:38.418
I'm not sure if you saw, but... Our precious senpai, Haachama-senpai, also reached a big milestone of 8.8 million views on her original song, Red Heart!

20:39.178 --> 20:43.599
We always, we loved Red Heart so much!

20:43.639 --> 20:47.840
I feel like it's such an emotional and exciting original song, but...

20:48.220 --> 20:51.443
We always end up getting a bit teary-eyed when we hear it.

20:51.523 --> 20:52.124
Yeah.

20:52.424 --> 20:54.646
I don't know, it's just something about it, huh?

20:54.986 --> 20:55.227
Yeah.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.009
But we're so happy for Haachama-senpai!

20:58.169 --> 20:58.610
Yeah.

20:58.770 --> 21:01.332
But, well, we congratulated her on Twitter.

21:01.352 --> 21:01.793
Yeah.

21:02.093 --> 21:05.817
She responded to our BAU BAU with a bug bug.

21:05.837 --> 21:08.419
Huh?

21:08.679 --> 21:08.920
What?

21:09.659 --> 21:10.659
What does that mean?

21:11.119 --> 21:11.740
Bug, bug.

21:12.140 --> 21:12.720
Bug, bug.

21:12.780 --> 21:13.860
Hello, hello, bug.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.140
Bug, bug, bug.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.421
I have no clue, Ruffians.

21:18.081 --> 21:20.502
Do you have any insight?

21:20.702 --> 21:22.962
Insight into Haachama-senpai's mind.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.003
Something that we're missing.

21:25.343 --> 21:26.103
Bug, bug.

21:26.323 --> 21:30.164
Does she want to eat bugs with us?

21:32.177 --> 21:37.822
Is this the dialect of BAU BAU?

21:37.842 --> 21:39.303
I haven't heard that one before.

21:40.104 --> 21:41.065
She loves bugs.

21:41.585 --> 21:42.646
Invitation.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.571
Taranchama.

21:49.612 --> 21:50.653
I don't know, Ruffians.

21:50.693 --> 21:52.715
How should we respond to her?

21:52.855 --> 21:54.937
It's just a typo, you think?

21:56.298 --> 21:57.419
I don't know about that.

22:00.684 --> 22:03.866
It's a BAU BAU invitation!

22:04.066 --> 22:04.866
Just say yes!

22:04.966 --> 22:05.726
Just say yes!

22:06.507 --> 22:06.907
Yes?

22:07.967 --> 22:09.648
Yes, BAU BAU yummy.

22:09.688 --> 22:10.689
BAU BAU yummy.

22:10.729 --> 22:11.729
Yes, BAU BAU.

22:12.469 --> 22:15.671
Okay, well... I guess we'll try that then!

22:16.571 --> 22:16.851
Yes!

22:16.911 --> 22:17.712
Yes, BAU BAU!

22:18.852 --> 22:19.332
Okay.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.653
Thank you, Ruffians!

22:22.494 --> 22:24.234
BAU BAU!

22:24.454 --> 22:29.256
We should ask the Ruffians more often for how we should respond to our senpai, right?

22:29.276 --> 22:31.517
Because we get nervous, right?

22:31.537 --> 22:33.258
Thank you, Ruffians.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.999
Thank you!

22:36.079 --> 22:39.881
BAU BAU!

22:40.621 --> 22:41.622
Ruffians!

22:42.822 --> 22:44.303
It's that time of the week?

22:46.707 --> 22:49.648
Time to challenge yourself to something new, right?

22:51.889 --> 23:02.594
So, Ruffians, after Moco-chan's amazing success last week at eating natto, we're gonna try again!

23:02.674 --> 23:06.375
Moco-chan is time to challenge natto!

23:06.395 --> 23:08.656
Do we have soy sauce this time?

23:08.736 --> 23:09.477
No, we're out!

23:09.517 --> 23:10.277
Why?

23:10.317 --> 23:12.078
We're out of the sesame oil.

23:12.178 --> 23:14.119
We're out of the soy sauce.

23:14.799 --> 23:14.939
Yup.

23:16.332 --> 23:18.634
I'm looking around for it and I didn't see it.

23:19.194 --> 23:28.381
Yeah, well, for some Ruffians that are not too sure maybe what natto is, natto is a very common breakfast food in Japan that consists of fermented soy beans.

23:28.922 --> 23:31.164
And it's really, really healthy for you.

23:31.224 --> 23:39.950
Lots of good vitamins, good for the tummy, but it's very slimy and stinky and... Sticky.

23:40.170 --> 23:40.531
S-S-S.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.112
But it's really good.

23:42.192 --> 23:43.533
And I really like it lots.

23:43.873 --> 23:45.755
And I want Moco-chan to be able to protect

23:46.175 --> 23:47.876
You're slow for a long time.

23:47.896 --> 23:50.017
And Moco-chan, you want to do this too, right?

23:50.037 --> 23:53.499
Yeah, I just feel like it's difficult first thing in the morning.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.842
When you're supposed to eat natto, I just feel like it's difficult.

23:58.523 --> 24:00.224
My tummy's not ready for that yet.

24:00.264 --> 24:00.604
Really?

24:00.644 --> 24:02.825
Because I woke up brighter earlier.

24:02.845 --> 24:06.167
I was like, oh my goodness, I want to eat natto right now.

24:06.187 --> 24:12.131
And I was seriously considering it, but then I was like, oh, then that would mean I'd eat two packs a day, and I don't know.

24:13.809 --> 24:30.266
So, now Moco-chan, I am in the mood for natto, but I want you to eat just as much, if not more than last time, because Moco-chan last time she ate 8 beans of natto, her highest record, but she had a lot of help from Mr. Soy Sauce.

24:30.286 --> 24:33.509
So, well, Moco-chan, do you think you can do it today?

24:34.955 --> 24:36.496
I don't have confidence.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.636
The raw natto.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.297
I don't have confidence.

24:39.777 --> 24:41.137
You can go ahead and eat!

24:41.357 --> 24:42.218
I did have eight!

24:42.258 --> 24:44.319
Ten beans today?

24:44.339 --> 24:44.379
No!

24:44.859 --> 24:46.599
It looks really, really good!

24:46.619 --> 24:47.920
Aim for two.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.280
It looks like it's hot bean.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.801
Okay, we're aiming for two!

24:50.941 --> 24:51.601
Okay.

24:52.241 --> 24:59.444
Okay, well, before you... It hit me!

24:59.484 --> 25:01.225
The smell hit me!

25:01.525 --> 25:03.726
Moco-chan, do you know what we have to do first?

25:03.786 --> 25:04.166
Here.

25:05.447 --> 25:06.808
Thank you.

25:07.349 --> 25:11.353
We have to thank the farmers in Tochigi who worked hard to make this.

25:12.830 --> 25:13.551
Thank you!

25:13.571 --> 25:16.833
Thank you, Tochigi Farmers!

25:17.253 --> 25:18.454
Now, Moco-chan!

25:18.775 --> 25:24.879
You're gonna show everybody how delicious natto is and that you're a strong, good dog, right?

25:25.260 --> 25:27.261
The smell keeps on hitting me!

25:27.882 --> 25:29.063
Oh, that's one bean!

25:29.083 --> 25:30.424
It is one bean!

25:30.484 --> 25:32.345
Gotta hurry it up, Moco-chan!

25:32.365 --> 25:32.425
Why?!

25:32.886 --> 25:33.466
Speed!

25:33.886 --> 25:34.407
Speed!

25:34.467 --> 25:36.388
I'm not speedrunning natto!

25:37.049 --> 25:39.310
I think it'd be easier if you speedrun it.

25:39.351 --> 25:39.571
No!

25:41.417 --> 25:44.742
Okay, here we go!

25:44.762 --> 25:44.742
3, 2, 1!

25:47.405 --> 25:48.267
Okay, good, good.

25:48.387 --> 25:51.451
Oh, oh no, the face is bad right off- Oh, no, no, no.

25:51.771 --> 25:52.953
Moco-chan, you can do it!

25:53.414 --> 25:54.996
You can do it, just the first being.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.798
Once you get used to it then.

26:03.905 --> 26:09.186
Isn't it a bit rough today, Moco-chan?

26:09.966 --> 26:10.926
Don't cry!

26:10.946 --> 26:12.327
It's a bit rough today.

26:12.367 --> 26:13.547
You're gonna get strong!

26:13.587 --> 26:15.207
You can do it, Moco-chan!

26:16.187 --> 26:17.327
It's a bit rough today.

26:18.548 --> 26:20.048
Never, never give up!

26:21.828 --> 26:23.369
Moco-chan, never, never give up.

26:23.869 --> 26:28.629
It's not Pup Talk Day, okay?

26:28.690 --> 26:30.110
Go, go, Mococo!

26:30.150 --> 26:30.670
Ganbare!

26:32.785 --> 26:34.227
Second bead.

26:34.707 --> 26:35.948
Second bead!

26:35.968 --> 26:37.570
You can do it, Moco-chan!

26:37.690 --> 26:38.411
In it goes!

26:38.511 --> 26:39.172
In it goes!

26:39.192 --> 26:39.172
3, 2, 1!

26:39.432 --> 26:41.114
You did it!

26:41.154 --> 26:41.914
You did it!

26:55.840 --> 26:56.801
That seemed to go better.

26:56.841 --> 26:58.181
No, no, that's it, that's it, that's it!

26:58.201 --> 26:58.521
Three!

26:58.541 --> 26:58.701
Three!

26:58.821 --> 27:00.782
No, no, no, I hate my goal!

27:00.802 --> 27:01.142
Two!

27:01.182 --> 27:02.323
I'm over my goal!

27:02.363 --> 27:03.423
That's enough!

27:04.623 --> 27:05.864
BAU BAU.

27:05.884 --> 27:07.624
Did you hear my stomp?

27:07.724 --> 27:09.285
Moco-chan stomping.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.405
That stomp!

27:10.525 --> 27:15.347
It's very sticky today, but there's lots of strings.

27:16.287 --> 27:16.887
Wow.

27:17.568 --> 27:18.568
It must be very fresh.

27:20.151 --> 27:22.759
What did you think, Moco-chan, compared to the flavor last week?

27:22.860 --> 27:25.066
I liked it last week better.

27:25.247 --> 27:27.012
No, not this week.

27:27.759 --> 27:29.000
BAU BAU!

27:30.441 --> 27:33.464
Last week's harvest was better for our birds, okay?

27:33.504 --> 27:34.525
Work a bit harder.

27:36.346 --> 27:38.668
It's not their fault, it's the soybeans.

27:38.748 --> 27:40.930
You know, they need to work harder.

27:42.771 --> 27:43.932
BAU BAU!

27:44.012 --> 27:44.793
BAU BAU!

27:44.833 --> 27:51.959
Ruffians, remember to do your best in all the things that you want to conquer and challenge yourself to this week too, okay?

27:51.999 --> 27:52.860
Just like Moco-chan!

27:52.940 --> 27:54.221
I feel hot now!

27:57.740 --> 27:58.221
It's good!

27:58.501 --> 28:00.782
You're ready to go for a brand new week!

28:01.463 --> 28:03.444
BAU BAU!

28:05.705 --> 28:06.526
Wow!

28:06.546 --> 28:10.248
Moco-chan, you did pretty good at the challenge today!

28:10.268 --> 28:13.050
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day is today!

28:14.318 --> 28:14.779
Wow.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.962
Should we look at the Doggie of the Day?

28:18.002 --> 28:19.524
I think I'll see you up right.

28:19.825 --> 28:21.386
Maybe.

28:22.388 --> 28:23.509
Wow.

28:23.589 --> 28:29.977
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Lucy!

28:30.017 --> 28:30.798
So pretty!

28:31.278 --> 28:31.719
Right?

28:31.759 --> 28:34.141
Such pretty eyes and coloring.

28:34.762 --> 28:40.128
Wow, apparently Lucy, Lucy's a bit of a scaredy cat.

28:40.228 --> 28:43.392
This is the Doggie of the Day, not the cat.

28:43.492 --> 28:47.796
Well, you know, she does her best though to be the toughest guard dog she can be.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.019
She's just like us.

28:50.079 --> 28:52.902
Yeah, we're a little bit scaredy cat.

28:53.242 --> 28:53.523
No.

28:53.563 --> 28:53.703
No.

28:53.763 --> 28:54.043
No.

28:54.544 --> 28:54.864
Uh-uh.

28:55.084 --> 28:55.665
Scaredy dog.

28:56.331 --> 28:57.351
BAU BAU!

28:57.371 --> 28:58.492
BAU BAU!

29:26.607 --> 29:28.428
I don't know, is that loud enough?

29:28.848 --> 29:29.528
BAU BAU!

29:30.188 --> 29:34.049
That's a really high-pitched, but... Is it loud?

29:34.069 --> 29:36.210
I think that's loud.

29:37.030 --> 29:39.971
I don't know, it kinda sounds louder.

29:40.331 --> 29:41.612
Louder, I think.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.873
Yeah, that's like loud, it's not super loud.

29:45.453 --> 29:47.594
Well, do you have any ideas?

29:48.621 --> 29:49.322
BAU BAU!

29:49.922 --> 29:50.863
It sounds the same.

29:50.983 --> 29:51.924
BAU BAU!

29:54.786 --> 29:55.306
Like that?

29:55.406 --> 29:56.127
Maybe.

29:56.407 --> 29:57.288
Maybe.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.930
I think that's about it.

30:03.012 --> 30:03.772
BAU BAU!

30:04.293 --> 30:06.575
BAU BAU!

30:06.615 --> 30:10.638
You know, Lucy might have a super loud BAU BAU.

30:10.698 --> 30:14.360
But she's just a sweetheart of a puppy and she does her best.

30:14.420 --> 30:14.841
Yeah.

30:15.121 --> 30:15.601
You know.

30:16.820 --> 30:17.100
BAU BAU!

30:41.556 --> 30:42.876
Well, next!

30:43.157 --> 30:46.577
We have our Today I Went on a Walk!

30:46.677 --> 30:50.678
And we have... De-den!

30:50.998 --> 30:54.219
Pretty sky beach!

30:54.299 --> 30:57.400
It's so sandy!

30:57.420 --> 31:02.461
You know, sandy beaches, I feel like they're a bit rarer than northwest passes.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.642
Yeah, they're not as beautiful, that's for sure.

31:05.822 --> 31:06.802
But we like the beach!

31:06.862 --> 31:10.283
You know, playing in the water, making sandcastles.

31:10.803 --> 31:11.763
Deer game.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.624
Playing with crabs.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.764
You know, gathering shells.

31:16.244 --> 31:17.825
It's a lot of fun, huh?

31:17.905 --> 31:20.045
There's so much to do at the beach.

31:20.205 --> 31:22.065
I don't think you know, there's a parasol.

31:22.105 --> 31:24.566
We'll be definitely outside the parasol.

31:24.586 --> 31:28.547
But remember, Ruffians, sunscreen is super important.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.367
Sunscreen!

31:29.407 --> 31:30.067
Sunscreen!

31:30.107 --> 31:32.928
We can't become red hot hot dogs or anything.

31:34.228 --> 31:37.229
So please be careful, okay?

31:37.770 --> 31:39.810
BAU BAU!

31:40.711 --> 31:48.014
It would be nice to walk down the sandy beach, right?

31:48.694 --> 31:57.191
Well, maybe it's a little bit cold still in the Northwest Passage, but in the future.

31:57.552 --> 32:13.085
And next for our Question of the Day, we have... My question is, how do you feel about Ruffian's drawing stream assets for the both of you?

32:13.345 --> 32:14.366
Like silly hats?

32:16.254 --> 32:17.835
Do you encourage us too?

32:18.155 --> 32:20.636
Would you like to use Ruffian-made assets?

32:21.056 --> 32:21.716
Thank you!

32:21.796 --> 32:22.396
Love you!

32:22.556 --> 32:24.417
BAU BAU!

32:25.457 --> 32:28.339
We love it!

32:28.419 --> 32:31.140
So much that when you ask I want to go NO!

32:34.181 --> 32:35.022
Just to be silly?

32:35.062 --> 32:36.202
Just to be silly.

32:37.363 --> 32:45.168
But actually, hashtag FUWAMOCO is also supposed to be a place where you can share things like that with us too.

32:45.328 --> 32:50.291
You know, anything that you think could make us or make our streams more fun.

32:50.452 --> 32:54.234
Yeah, you know, we would love assets or anything you think would be cool.

32:55.215 --> 33:01.058
We'll do our best to use them, but sometimes we can't for a lot of reasons too.

33:02.279 --> 33:04.640
If we can't, please understand, okay?

33:05.381 --> 33:11.363
But if there's something you think would be cool for us to have or use, feel free, okay?

33:11.423 --> 33:15.926
We're always waiting and we absolutely will use them where we can.

33:16.066 --> 33:17.486
Go at it!

33:18.247 --> 33:19.787
BAU BAU!

33:19.907 --> 33:20.748
Great assets!

33:21.528 --> 33:27.191
Maybe in the future, Ruffians maybe provide us with some great, great assets.

33:27.331 --> 33:27.711
BAU BAU!

33:31.733 --> 33:35.076
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

33:35.676 --> 33:40.661
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we always make together.

33:41.381 --> 33:48.147
Well, you know, Ruffians, we have our Extra Special Ruffian at the end of every FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

33:50.448 --> 33:56.672
If you want to be further part of FUWAMOCO Morning, you can always send submissions to Doggie of the Day Pero Sightings!

33:57.413 --> 34:12.082
Because you know this, thankfully, many Ruffians, hundreds, thousands of Ruffians join us for FUWAMOCO Morning, but for submissions, well, there's less than thousands, less than hundreds, sometimes even less than tens!

34:12.162 --> 34:12.642
Sorry!

34:13.883 --> 34:15.425
We're always waiting, okay?

34:15.445 --> 34:18.387
We're waiting, okay?

34:18.747 --> 34:20.068
Please use the hashtag!

34:20.148 --> 34:21.930
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

34:22.190 --> 34:25.893
BAU BAU BAU!

34:25.933 --> 34:34.240
Well, for our next stream coming up tonight, with the Doggy Pack, we're gonna be watching The Notebook!

34:34.741 --> 34:36.702
The famous romance movie.

34:37.463 --> 34:39.085
We've never seen it before.

34:39.105 --> 34:41.327
I have no clue what to expect at all.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.029
It's a romance movie.

34:43.049 --> 34:47.454
There's a notebook, the cover, and the rain.

34:47.474 --> 34:48.054
That's it!

34:49.115 --> 34:52.959
Maybe they get an umbrella, maybe they don't.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.462
I don't know, but it's about a notebook.

34:55.502 --> 34:56.944
That's how I feel.

34:57.324 --> 34:58.665
Let's try not to cry.

34:59.608 --> 35:00.048
BAU BAU!

35:18.894 --> 35:29.597
I think you know we're going to get to know Choco-senpai a lot and share a lot of our personal information with her.

35:29.617 --> 35:30.937
Personal information?

35:30.957 --> 35:33.337
Yeah, hololive body measurement.

35:48.490 --> 35:48.790
Hi.

35:48.950 --> 35:49.270
Hi.

35:49.690 --> 35:53.472
I don't know, we're a bit nervous, but... Did I hear about that?

35:53.572 --> 36:00.374
Please look forward to it, Ruffians!

36:00.494 --> 36:00.975
