[Kei-ki](https://twitter.com/kei_ki/status/1694435692896469225) founds Pero exploring Teotihuacan.

FUWAMOCO reached 600K subscribers on YouTube during their [endurance Suika Game stream](https://youtu.be/3PFyuPcp-Fw?t=13583)!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Advent Halloween ([11:14](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=11m14s))

This week: Halloween party. Sunday, collab + announcement. Send ideas for costumes on Twitter using the hashtag [#DressUpFWMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DressUpFWMC).

## ü§í BAU BAU BYOU ([14:15](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=14m15s))

Some Ruffians have reported having some very specific [nightmares](https://youtu.be/QW_VwFyUBeU). FUWAMOCO hope that those Ruffians get well soon‚Ä¶

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([16:39](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=16m39s))

During [last Suika game stream](https://youtu.be/3PFyuPcp-Fw?t=5321), as part of their punishment games if they didn't reach 3000 points at any round, Moco-chan had to say some embarrassing lines. One of them made her regress on her age and become a baby. Mococo clarifies that she is, in fact, not a baby.

## üê¶ Twitter Exposure ([19:18](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=19m18s))

They know what you do: X (formerly Twitter) is snitching to FUWAMOCO on all Ruffians' activities: from what other Ruffians are saying about them and how they interact with each other, to suspicious likes. ‚Ä¶and even some dubious sound bite compilations‚Ä¶ The sisters ask Ruffians to keep doing what they're most passionate with on Twitter without caring too much about being watched.

## üèÜ Natto Challenge ([21:55](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=21m55s))

Another attempt a natto without [quite the success that everyone hoped for‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=1602). Adding salt to the wound, [Fuwawa asserts some dominance](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=1727) by having a bite of the same natto with no issues whatsoever.

## üê∂ Doggie of the Day ([29:33](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=29m33s))

[Don (2theMAX) Miller](https://twitter.com/2theMAXStairFax/status/1712834437103116612)'s Chica. They like to make noises, just like Mococo!

## üö∂ Today I Went On A Walk ([32:04](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=32m04s))

[SkyCat](https://twitter.com/SkyCat46/status/1712131846144753694) spotted a white splash on a road. For some reason, Ruffians started to get worried about Pero‚Ä¶

## ‚ùì Question Of The Day ([33:16](https://youtu.be/qTcTR5q0gTk?t=33m16s))

[Pannysama](https://twitter.com/Pannysama/status/1713500769536946180) wonders if FUWAMOCO's content would have been different if the girls would had gotten into the Japanese branch. The twins don't expect there would have been any difference in terms of content, but perhaps a bit in terms of stiffness. For instance, Mococo thinks that it would have been harder to make commentary in Japanese while playing at the same time.
