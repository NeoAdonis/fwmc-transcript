05:10.695 --> 05:13.333
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:13.837 --> 05:18.543
Merry Christmas, Ruffians!

05:18.623 --> 05:24.569
It may be Christmas, but it's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:24.890 --> 05:28.394
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:28.434 --> 05:28.874
BAU BAU!

05:30.255 --> 05:34.699
I'm not Fuwa Santa, I'm Fuwawa!

05:35.380 --> 05:38.762
I'm not Moco Santa, I'm Mococo!

05:38.903 --> 05:41.625
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:41.705 --> 05:43.266
BAU BAU!

05:43.807 --> 05:49.511
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:49.791 --> 05:53.855
Thank you for joining us today for a very special episode.

05:55.316 --> 05:58.018
That only happens once a year.

05:58.119 --> 05:58.739
Once a year!

05:58.919 --> 06:02.863
The Christmas episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:03.223 --> 06:07.427
Moco-chan, today we're putting the sea into... Christmas.

06:07.447 --> 06:11.251
The Sea of Christmas into FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:11.271 --> 06:14.814
I don't think we have anything to do with the Sea of Christmas.

06:15.455 --> 06:16.495
I don't know.

06:17.296 --> 06:18.978
Ruffians, do you understand?

06:20.569 --> 06:23.292
It's Christmas, no more misunderstanding.

06:23.312 --> 06:25.834
BAU BAU!

06:25.854 --> 06:32.781
I hope for any Ruffians that are maybe early to see if Moco Santa brought them anything.

06:32.801 --> 06:35.303
FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:35.724 --> 06:38.126
It's a short format morning show held

06:38.306 --> 06:42.529
Every Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and even Christmas too!

06:42.909 --> 06:43.790
A.K.A.

06:44.150 --> 06:44.770
FUWAMOCO!

06:45.191 --> 06:48.593
Is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:49.233 --> 06:54.997
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:55.438 --> 07:00.541
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:00.921 --> 07:05.024
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:05.464 --> 07:07.325
BAU BAU!

07:09.027 --> 07:09.627
Ruffians.

07:11.088 --> 07:12.709
Did Moco-san to visit you?

07:12.729 --> 07:17.111
I'm just curious.

07:18.652 --> 07:21.634
Moco-chan, maybe we got some photos.

07:22.915 --> 07:23.595
Wow!

07:23.615 --> 07:28.758
It does seem like we had another Pero Sighting.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.721
Let's see what we have here!

07:33.381 --> 07:33.922
De-den!

07:38.641 --> 07:43.282
Yup, I think Moco-Santa visited this ruffian last night.

07:43.642 --> 07:45.603
Look at all those presents.

07:46.043 --> 07:50.144
So beautifully and carefully wrapped up there, you know.

07:50.484 --> 07:53.745
Waiting for you underneath the Christmas tree.

07:54.886 --> 08:03.828
But, uh, the one in the center there... Kinda looks a bit familiar, huh?

08:04.048 --> 08:06.169
Yeah, I recognize the silhouette.

08:11.757 --> 08:15.761
This present likes to move around when you turn away.

08:17.042 --> 08:23.849
Sometimes you can even hear a creepy laugh coming from it too.

08:26.820 --> 08:29.561
Well that is, uh, lovely.

08:30.101 --> 08:30.421
Yes.

08:31.862 --> 08:33.622
I love it when my toys make sounds like that.

08:33.662 --> 08:36.043
Creepy laugh.

08:36.623 --> 08:43.825
Could it be like, you know, when you have like a stuffed animal and you give it a nice big hug, it makes a cute sound?

08:44.045 --> 08:45.086
Is it like that?

08:46.626 --> 08:47.346
I don't think it is.

08:47.406 --> 08:48.006
Not this time.

08:50.592 --> 08:55.076
We hope that Moco-Santa brought everything you asked for!

08:55.216 --> 08:59.100
Maybe not this, but other things.

08:59.720 --> 09:04.104
If not those, please know that Moco-Santa worked very hard.

09:04.565 --> 09:10.911
And remember, that Moco-Santa also brought you that smile on your face too!

09:12.465 --> 09:15.886
BAU BAU!

09:16.266 --> 09:23.448
I want to see more Ruffians' photos, but... Well, we have important things to share, you know.

09:24.688 --> 09:26.169
All this month!

09:26.189 --> 09:30.970
I think you've had something to enjoy every single day after you wake up, huh?

09:31.030 --> 09:31.510
Right!

09:32.270 --> 09:36.034
Kind of like a Advent Calendar!

09:36.315 --> 09:37.716
That's right!

09:38.097 --> 09:41.360
The hololive English Advent Calendar!

09:41.400 --> 09:47.687
But it kicked off right from the beginning of the month, and it's been filled with a number of silly goodies.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.910
You mean Shira opened up every single one, right?

09:51.311 --> 09:57.216
Well, you can check them out at holoen-alvin.com!

09:57.296 --> 10:02.840
There's a super cute webpage for it, so make sure you go and check it out!

10:03.020 --> 10:03.440
I got it!

10:03.481 --> 10:07.544
Moco-chan, what was our favorite video?

10:07.884 --> 10:09.305
That's a hard one, but...

10:10.014 --> 10:12.498
You know, we had a lot of fun!

10:12.878 --> 10:16.804
But I feel like the first video was also very memorable for us.

10:17.765 --> 10:18.707
Very silly!

10:18.747 --> 10:20.329
I know that suits us.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.394
We kind of became Christmas ornaments, right?

10:25.897 --> 10:37.062
Every Advent Calendar will eventually reach the end, but there's been a little hiccup, and the grand finale will be reaching you a little later than expected.

10:37.102 --> 10:38.482
But you know what?

10:38.902 --> 10:41.944
That just means that you can look forward to it!

10:42.024 --> 10:43.584
Look forward to it within this week.

10:44.785 --> 10:47.606
Thank you for enjoying the Advent Calendar!

10:48.126 --> 10:53.410
We're glad that hololive EN could bring a little cheer to every day of yours this December.

10:53.430 --> 10:53.630

Animation 2 and you can find it over on the official YouTube channel.

11:22.589 --> 11:24.811
It was so cute!

11:25.011 --> 11:28.995
It starts with Jingle Bells and then it continues on from there.

11:29.015 --> 11:32.457
I was really excited to watch it.

11:32.517 --> 11:35.860
See our Senpais take on such great songs.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.621
See which song they have to sing next!

11:39.703 --> 11:46.048
Also, in case you missed it, we have some very cozy Christmas merch on pre-order right now.

11:46.369 --> 11:47.149
So check it out!

11:47.169 --> 11:50.152
Ruffians, do you know what I'm going to say?

11:55.498 --> 11:57.740
Maybe they have an idea.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.744
I really like the Festive Christmas mug and plate.

12:02.325 --> 12:05.348
You know, the mug is very cute.

12:05.708 --> 12:12.815
It makes you feel like maybe drinking a big cup of hot moco-kai out of it.

12:13.215 --> 12:15.097
You know, yeah, that's the mug, huh?

12:16.138 --> 12:18.660
Maybe it could be another mug for my collection too.

12:20.438 --> 12:24.301
BAU BAU!

12:27.704 --> 12:39.493
Ruffians, we have a lot planned for the holidays for the end of the year here, but maybe, just maybe, are you still looking for a way, a fun way, to enjoy your Christmas today?

12:41.915 --> 12:49.040
In case you aren't, earlier this month we released some very special Christmas voicebacks!

12:49.500 --> 12:50.841
All of our ventures.

12:51.341 --> 12:55.044
This time they're both in English and Japanese.

12:55.104 --> 12:59.887
You can have a little listen to a sample beforehand too just to see what they're like.

13:03.012 --> 13:11.538
FUWAMOCO, we had just a little bit of fun imagining what kind of Christmas we'd like to share with you.

13:11.839 --> 13:15.982
We hope that maybe you'll decide to join us and have a listen to them.

13:16.482 --> 13:19.944
That way we can bring a bit more Christmas to you.

13:20.024 --> 13:21.485
Even more Christmas!

13:21.666 --> 13:23.027
Are you ready for that, Ruffians?

13:23.287 --> 13:24.708
Even more Christmas!

13:27.279 --> 13:29.521
One of you are Christmas Wastebag.

13:30.182 --> 13:32.504
Don't have a Christmas Overload, okay?

13:32.644 --> 13:33.905
I won't want that.

13:34.545 --> 13:35.926
BAU BAU!

13:35.946 --> 13:38.689
BAU BAU!

13:39.750 --> 13:44.514
Well, Ruffians, you know, if you haven't noticed, it's Christmas.

13:44.754 --> 13:46.555
It's Christmas Day today.

13:46.595 --> 13:52.721
If you haven't noticed, I would ask you to check your eyes.

13:52.801 --> 13:53.661
And well, you know,

13:56.285 --> 13:58.806
We've been on our best behavior this year.

13:58.866 --> 13:59.826
We have!

14:00.346 --> 14:01.727
We've done very well.

14:01.887 --> 14:03.067
What do you think, Ruffians?

14:03.387 --> 14:04.727
We did a good job, right?

14:04.807 --> 14:05.347
Right!

14:06.328 --> 14:07.928
Right?

14:09.068 --> 14:09.369
Right?

14:12.009 --> 14:12.909
Check your eyes.

14:13.870 --> 14:14.450
Hi!

14:15.170 --> 14:15.830
It's Christmas.

14:15.870 --> 14:17.451
We did an amazing job.

14:17.671 --> 14:18.591
A great job!

14:19.913 --> 14:21.074
I think we have it.

14:21.894 --> 14:25.577
We made a bit of a mistake.

14:25.797 --> 14:32.742
There's been a misunderstanding.

14:32.762 --> 14:32.982
BAU BAU.

14:43.573 --> 14:45.634
Abyss Understanding.

14:46.494 --> 14:57.938
Ruffians, you know, during our special Christmas Among Us collab with hololive English, you know, something surprising happened!

14:58.318 --> 15:02.859
Something even more surprising than FUWAMOCO becoming the impostor.

15:05.632 --> 15:06.993
We were the imposter.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.555
And unsurprisingly, everyone figured out that.

15:12.255 --> 15:15.357
And they got rid of us pretty fast.

15:16.157 --> 15:20.159
But you know, we whole grudges were the imposter.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.860
We're not just gonna give up.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.181
We're not gonna accept it.

15:23.261 --> 15:24.421
Not acceptable.

15:24.441 --> 15:30.685
So you know, when we were chatting as a ghost afterwards, we were telling everyone how we were innocent.

15:31.025 --> 15:32.806
Innocent puppies.

15:33.566 --> 15:33.866
Yeah.

15:34.747 --> 15:35.187
And, and,

15:36.820 --> 15:41.762
You know, Biboo, being Biboo, she saw through that.

15:42.882 --> 15:45.403
And so, we said, forget it Biboo!

15:45.483 --> 15:46.223
BAU BAU!

15:46.283 --> 15:47.304
Yeah, forget it!

15:48.204 --> 15:51.005
But, uh, among us didn't like that.

15:51.805 --> 15:52.686
And censored me.

15:54.646 --> 15:56.847
Maybe I was a bit too aggressive with it.

15:56.967 --> 16:01.889
Well, you know, even at that moment, Moco-chan, I thought you crossed the line too, you know?

16:02.932 --> 16:06.054
You don't need to take that toll on Biboo and Ame-senpai.

16:06.074 --> 16:12.058
I really didn't realize that you're that kind of dog, Moco-chan.

16:12.158 --> 16:14.099
I was just trying to be a good imposter.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.161
That's what an imposter would say, huh?

16:20.182 --> 16:23.665
I think you really shocked our senpai, too.

16:23.825 --> 16:28.087
Even Ame-senpai thought that your aggression was directed towards her, too, so...

16:30.091 --> 16:31.272
It was embarrassing.

16:32.073 --> 16:33.134
I was embarrassed.

16:34.455 --> 16:36.457
It was a big misunderstanding, huh?

16:37.538 --> 16:37.999
Right!

16:38.879 --> 16:40.461
I didn't mean to come off that way!

16:42.122 --> 16:43.384
You get it, right, Ruffians?

16:44.745 --> 16:45.946
You understand now?

16:48.448 --> 16:48.789
Right?

16:50.650 --> 16:51.491
Poor Biboo.

16:52.072 --> 16:53.753
No, you mean poor Mococo!

16:56.098 --> 16:58.059
It's Christmas, okay?

16:58.879 --> 17:00.279
It's Christmas!

17:01.020 --> 17:11.743
Hopefully, Moco-chan, that's our last big misunderstanding of 2023.

17:12.664 --> 17:13.044
Yes!

17:13.624 --> 17:15.345
It better be!

17:16.385 --> 17:17.205
BAU BAU!

17:19.400 --> 17:20.421
Last misunderstanding?

17:20.441 --> 17:21.902
BAU BAU!

17:22.322 --> 17:26.344
You're still a bit shocked?

17:26.945 --> 17:27.885
I'm sorry.

17:28.325 --> 17:33.689
I was pretty shocked too, but... It was among us.

17:33.809 --> 17:37.691
It was a misunderstanding.

17:37.831 --> 17:38.792
Ruffians!

17:39.412 --> 17:40.213
It's Gabi-sumas.

17:40.813 --> 17:42.134
It is.

17:43.615 --> 17:47.337
So... You know... We kind of have...

17:48.357 --> 17:49.437
A present for you!

17:52.618 --> 17:54.679
Maybe you know that already.

17:55.379 --> 17:56.699
Maybe.

17:56.719 --> 18:01.901
But, you know, we wanted to add an extra present on your Christmas tree.

18:01.961 --> 18:03.521
No, why is it just for you?

18:04.581 --> 18:08.182
So, we prepared a new song of a cover.

18:08.642 --> 18:12.583
A new song cover of a song that we really like.

18:13.704 --> 18:14.204
A cover of...

18:16.321 --> 18:22.325
It's a really famous winter song in Japan.

18:22.506 --> 18:23.366
It's very emotional.

18:23.606 --> 18:25.147
It has a really good meaning behind it.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.854
So we wanted to sing it for you.

18:35.054 --> 18:39.977
We think maybe with this, you'll be able to hear a bit of a different FUWAMOCO.

18:40.097 --> 18:43.799
We want you to listen to it as soon as possible, okay?

18:44.199 --> 18:48.982
So right after FUWAMOCO Morning today, we'll be going to the Premium!

18:49.442 --> 18:50.363
All together!

18:50.383 --> 18:52.184
We want to see your reaction, okay?

18:52.444 --> 18:55.065
When you open up the present.

18:55.185 --> 18:56.806
What we want to hear, what you think of it too.

18:57.907 --> 19:05.992
You know, it's been a very busy time for FUWAMOCO, but we're really, really happy we could have this present ready for you.

19:06.092 --> 19:06.453
Yeah!

19:06.473 --> 19:10.395
Please just wait a little longer until opening, okay?

19:11.055 --> 19:13.557
Only a couple more minutes, okay?

19:13.797 --> 19:15.799
The premiere will be right after this, okay?

19:15.819 --> 19:17.159
We'll go all together, okay?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.540
So don't worry about missing it.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.261
BAU BAU!

19:19.281 --> 19:21.842
BAU BAU!

19:22.303 --> 19:26.365
Well, speaking of presents...

19:30.660 --> 19:34.003
The only present we prepared for today.

19:34.823 --> 19:43.871
Actually, you know, rather than this one being a present from us, this is more of a present from Mama Puppy.

19:44.211 --> 19:53.839
Mama Puppy, you know, she surprised us yesterday by popping by to drop off some special Christmas gear and food traditional to the Northwest Passage.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.583
We thought that maybe...

20:14.983 --> 20:23.473
We do our Twitterspace and put them up all together here!

20:23.814 --> 20:30.061
So, at 9.10am PT or 2.10am JST, we're gonna be holding a Christmas Morning Twitterspace!

20:30.121 --> 20:31.503
BAU BAU!

20:35.595 --> 20:36.636
Sighted Ruffians!

20:36.936 --> 20:39.217
Maybe we could open presents all together!

20:39.517 --> 20:43.159
Oh, maybe we've already opened your presents.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.159
That's okay.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.680
You didn't need to wait for us.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.783
I'm sort of curious what's going to be in the stockings.

20:53.704 --> 20:57.387
We're looking forward to opening them up for you!

20:57.607 --> 21:01.409
BAU BAU!

21:01.569 --> 21:03.250
So many exciting things.

21:03.330 --> 21:06.212
So many Christmas things.

21:07.113 --> 21:08.093
It's Christmas!

21:10.424 --> 21:20.388
Well, not only is it just Christmas today, it's also the start of the very last week of 2023.

21:22.169 --> 21:32.493
So, you know, with even more passion than usual, that means we absolutely need to challenge ourselves to something new.

21:33.618 --> 21:34.919
What is eggnog, Moco-chan?

21:57.778 --> 22:06.702
I don't really know, but I think it's eggs and a nog and milk.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.242
Is nog the milk?

22:13.064 --> 22:13.964
I think I heard right.

22:15.445 --> 22:16.586
Eggs plus Nogs.

22:16.746 --> 22:17.066
Right.

22:17.566 --> 22:18.906
Egg Nog.

22:19.067 --> 22:22.948
Well, our history with Egg Nog isn't very long.

22:23.688 --> 22:26.690
We tried some of our very little puppies.

22:27.730 --> 22:28.210
Oh, he did it.

22:29.251 --> 22:29.471
Yeah.

22:30.211 --> 22:31.592
So we never had it again!

22:31.692 --> 22:32.852
Never again.

22:33.412 --> 22:38.615
But today we'll overcome those bad memories and challenge it again!

22:38.635 --> 22:40.856
Okay, Ruffians?

22:42.827 --> 22:44.528
You're gonna challenge it with us, right?

22:45.148 --> 22:55.512
But, you know, interestingly enough, we actually have two different types of eggnog today.

22:56.293 --> 23:07.457
Well, Mama Fuffy, you know, she probably heard that we're going to be challenging ourselves to some eggnog today, and she thought that she'd help out by importing some for us too.

23:08.097 --> 23:11.419
That was really kind of her to hide!

23:12.956 --> 23:21.245
Today we have a classic eggnog and a traditional eggnog.

23:22.986 --> 23:23.667
What's the difference?

23:23.687 --> 23:25.229
I don't know.

23:25.429 --> 23:26.230
Maybe that will be...

23:27.568 --> 23:28.268
Moco-chan.

23:28.709 --> 23:33.551
Well, I don't think any farmers from Tochigi were involved in the process of making the eggnog.

23:34.052 --> 23:35.272
So, uh, yeah.

23:35.533 --> 23:36.873
I don't think so either.

23:36.913 --> 23:38.054
But still, thank you.

23:38.254 --> 23:49.220
Moco-chan, maybe let's say thank you to all the eggs, and the chickens, and the nogs, and the cows, and the farmers, and all those who worked hard for us today.

23:49.541 --> 23:51.162
And Moco-chan!

23:51.182 --> 23:52.042
Mama puppy too.

23:52.062 --> 23:52.863
And Mama puppy.

23:53.903 --> 23:54.764
And Papa puppy.

23:56.104 --> 23:56.405
Moco-chan.

23:58.283 --> 24:01.646
I don't know if I want to be a part of the corner like this.

24:01.786 --> 24:05.728
Now that you're a part of the challenge corner, you don't want to participate?

24:05.989 --> 24:06.189
Okay.

24:08.090 --> 24:10.992
Moco-chan, you take- Why do I have to start?

24:11.633 --> 24:12.533
We're both gonna start.

24:12.573 --> 24:13.594
You take the classic.

24:14.155 --> 24:18.157
I'll take the traditional.

24:19.118 --> 24:21.860
At a glance, it's rather thick.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.844
The colors are different too.

24:32.658 --> 24:36.779
It's supposed to look nice, right?

24:38.480 --> 24:41.981
It has a bit of a festive smell to it, but not in a good way.

24:42.361 --> 24:47.702
I don't know, mine smells like fruit milk.

24:47.883 --> 24:48.483
Fruit milk!

24:51.784 --> 24:52.464
Yours is worse.

24:52.524 --> 24:54.084
Yours is worse.

24:54.144 --> 24:54.584
Oh, thank you.

24:54.644 --> 24:56.785
Thank you for telling me that mine is worse!

24:56.845 --> 24:58.846
Yours is much, much, much, much more thin.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.250
Yes, it smells like fruit milk.

25:06.332 --> 25:06.512
What?

25:06.852 --> 25:08.433
Nothing is wrong with my nose!

25:08.453 --> 25:09.714
That's what it smells like!

25:11.736 --> 25:13.557
Ruffians!

25:13.737 --> 25:15.018
What is it?

25:15.118 --> 25:17.640
There's little stuff floating in it.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.001
Is it supposed to be like that?

25:19.021 --> 25:19.882
It is.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.044
It looks like tea grinds.

25:22.064 --> 25:23.124
It does.

25:24.966 --> 25:25.906
Just take a sip.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.308
You say it like it's easy.

25:28.428 --> 25:29.109
Okay, Moco-chan.

25:32.461 --> 25:37.283
I don't know how I'm supposed to have this, but I feel like I want chopsticks.

25:37.343 --> 25:40.425
That's not the way!

25:40.545 --> 25:42.906
I have a straw and I don't want to use it.

25:43.646 --> 25:44.947
Okay, Moco-chan.

25:46.007 --> 25:48.588
Let's count down from ten together, okay?

25:50.769 --> 25:51.110
Ten.

25:51.950 --> 25:52.330
Nine.

25:53.271 --> 25:53.531
Eight.

25:54.571 --> 25:55.031
Seven.

25:55.952 --> 25:56.532
Six.

25:57.212 --> 25:57.613
Five.

25:58.553 --> 25:58.993
Four.

25:59.013 --> 26:00.174
Three.

26:02.918 --> 26:04.700
It's scary.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.081
You have the straw!

26:06.101 --> 26:06.901
Moco-chan!

26:12.005 --> 26:16.428
That's really sweet.

26:16.588 --> 26:22.393
It tastes like fruit milk.

26:23.353 --> 26:25.355
It took a while going up the straw.

26:25.535 --> 26:26.676
Yeah.

26:26.996 --> 26:27.997
It tastes like fruit milk.

26:28.517 --> 26:30.639
That tastes like fruit milk.

26:32.852 --> 26:33.713
I don't like it.

26:33.733 --> 26:35.534
Is it different?

26:35.554 --> 26:36.934
Is it that different?

26:37.275 --> 26:38.235
It's really thick.

26:38.355 --> 26:39.136
It's really thick.

26:39.216 --> 26:41.117
It's not good.

26:41.757 --> 26:42.838
Okay, switch now.

26:44.619 --> 26:46.460
They are very different from each other.

26:46.480 --> 26:51.442
It tastes like fruit milk.

26:51.482 --> 26:52.363
That was the other one.

26:52.763 --> 26:53.744
Okay, are we gonna try one?

26:54.084 --> 26:56.065
It tastes festive in a horrible way.

26:57.935 --> 26:59.615
That's a traditional flavor.

27:01.296 --> 27:06.697
I'm gonna try the classic which Moco-chan calls Fruit Milk.

27:07.297 --> 27:08.957
Three... Wait, three?

27:09.577 --> 27:19.859
Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Oh, this one's for babies.

27:20.820 --> 27:21.080
What?!

27:22.740 --> 27:24.660
It's Fruit Milk.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.101
This one is not Fruit Milk.

27:26.421 --> 27:27.281
That one's horrible.

27:28.750 --> 27:31.512
How can they be the same thing and so different?

27:32.673 --> 27:34.253
Classic and traditional.

27:35.754 --> 27:38.216
What's the difference between classic and traditional?

27:38.276 --> 27:38.856
The words!

27:40.117 --> 27:42.418
Shouldn't classic also be traditional?

27:42.438 --> 27:45.220
Traditional's horrible, Ruffians!

27:45.640 --> 27:49.763
It's really, like, look at the resistance when you put the straw through it!

27:49.963 --> 27:51.323
It just makes me feel upset.

27:51.824 --> 27:52.864
I'm uncomfortable.

27:52.884 --> 27:55.326
It's the same thing but different.

27:56.988 --> 27:58.188
Why would you drink this?

27:58.348 --> 27:59.629
Where are the eggs?

28:01.790 --> 28:02.870
Why is it so thick?

28:03.530 --> 28:04.991
Why does it taste like fruit?

28:06.611 --> 28:07.272
It's wrong.

28:07.312 --> 28:10.653
It's like, you know... Breakfast cereal!

28:10.773 --> 28:13.714
The only other answer is... Together now.

28:14.094 --> 28:15.015
We have to mix them.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.615
Mix them together!

28:17.675 --> 28:18.756
Yeah!

28:19.536 --> 28:21.117
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:21.217 --> 28:22.617
I'm gonna take out the straw.

28:22.637 --> 28:24.278
You're gonna get everywhere.

28:27.964 --> 28:29.865
I didn't spill but now the cup is very full.

28:37.895 --> 28:40.236
Moco-chan, you- We didn't need this, why?

28:40.256 --> 28:46.380
Moco-chan, you take one straw, and I'll take one straw, and we'll do the movie thing.

28:46.540 --> 28:55.465
It's like that, the movie, the fancy drink, when you have the one fancy drink and then two straws, and you drink it across the table.

28:55.485 --> 28:57.286
This is horrible!

28:57.426 --> 28:57.727
Okay.

28:57.887 --> 29:01.089
Five, four, three, two, one!

29:09.943 --> 29:12.245
Why did you do that to me?

29:13.867 --> 29:14.628
That is worse.

29:14.648 --> 29:15.849
That is definitely worse.

29:15.909 --> 29:16.449
It got worse.

29:16.529 --> 29:18.852
Traditional and classic is not supposed to mix.

29:18.872 --> 29:20.393
Worlds that aren't supposed to meet.

29:23.133 --> 29:30.116
Ruffians... I like sweet things, but it's not sweet in the right way.

29:33.078 --> 29:37.420
No, that's not something... No, not something to drink.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.922
But if you like it, well then that's good because we have a lot for you to drink.

29:44.703 --> 29:46.724
Please take the eggnog, okay?

29:46.784 --> 29:47.845
Ruffians!

29:48.485 --> 29:49.486
Not again, I feel like...

29:50.888 --> 29:52.209
I feel like my head hurts.

29:53.330 --> 29:57.312
We did our best today!

29:57.452 --> 29:59.874
I don't know if this is something I want to continue.

30:02.576 --> 30:04.337
We will leave this challenge in 2023.

30:09.017 --> 30:16.740
Moco-chan, you know, let's try our best not to forget the feelings that we had here today doing this challenge.

30:17.420 --> 30:20.682
And somehow, let's do our best to use those.

30:20.802 --> 30:21.862
What feelings were those?

30:22.262 --> 30:25.523
To push ourselves in 2024, too!

30:25.704 --> 30:27.584
What feelings am I supposed to feel?

30:28.225 --> 30:31.826
The taste in your mouth.

30:31.846 --> 30:32.066
That.

30:32.126 --> 30:32.286
No.

30:32.326 --> 30:33.166
That's not gonna help you.

30:33.206 --> 30:33.246
No.

30:33.266 --> 30:33.487
Nuh-uh.

30:35.180 --> 30:39.065
BAU BAU!

30:39.485 --> 30:40.546
Let's take a look.

30:40.927 --> 30:42.349
Do we have a Doggie of the Day today?

30:42.389 --> 30:43.470
Doggie of the Day!

30:43.790 --> 30:45.873
Doggie of the Christmas Day!

30:46.073 --> 30:49.937
Today's Doggie of the Christmas Day is... De-den!

30:50.098 --> 30:50.718
Senpai!

30:55.338 --> 30:55.858
Simba!

30:56.139 --> 31:00.325
You're so cute!

31:00.405 --> 31:02.167
Look at you!

31:03.049 --> 31:04.430
Simba's so happy!

31:04.951 --> 31:05.853
It's Christmas!

31:05.893 --> 31:08.496
Very peaceful Simba Christmas.

31:09.926 --> 31:11.528
How does Simba bau bau?

31:29.264 --> 31:30.846
Santa Claus is here!

31:30.866 --> 31:32.127
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

31:32.567 --> 31:39.354
Okay, when Santa Claus arrives for Simba, Simba goes like BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

31:39.374 --> 31:40.214
Oh, I like that.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.135
Very exciting.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.757
I think that's just how it is.

31:43.337 --> 31:43.517
Yeah.

31:45.379 --> 31:51.445
Well, you know, I can tell just from this scene of Pero, Simba loves Christmas.

31:51.765 --> 31:52.326
Very much.

31:52.686 --> 32:01.995
But no, not because Simba knows that Simba's gonna be showered with new toys and treats and some head pads too.

32:02.215 --> 32:02.335
No.

32:02.555 --> 32:03.236
It's not that.

32:03.877 --> 32:06.039
It's because Simba knows that

32:07.065 --> 32:09.087
We get to spend it together with you!

32:09.187 --> 32:10.127
Yeah!

32:10.528 --> 32:15.151
And you know sometimes there's also big fluffy white snow that gathers?

32:15.532 --> 32:16.512
And that's fun too!

32:16.673 --> 32:17.693
Pretty fun!

32:17.713 --> 32:18.734
BAU BAU!

32:18.834 --> 32:21.076
BAU BAU!

32:21.917 --> 32:23.278
Cute!

32:23.778 --> 32:29.342
And for our Walk of Christmas Day, do we have a nice festive walk?

32:29.523 --> 32:31.124
We have De-den!

32:35.645 --> 32:37.726
Those are some fluffy snowflakes.

32:37.786 --> 32:39.688
Really fluffy snowflakes!

32:39.988 --> 32:47.013
You know, it looks like you have a very, very, very white Christmas going on where you are, Hoi.

32:47.774 --> 32:49.695
We're so happy!

32:50.736 --> 32:53.638
I feel like I can almost hear your footsteps in the snow.

32:53.678 --> 32:55.159
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

33:00.635 --> 33:06.998
Well, we hope you're bundled up very, very tightly, very, very warmly for that nice walk.

33:07.138 --> 33:10.579
You need to make sure you don't catch a cold, okay?

33:10.959 --> 33:16.322
But, do try to catch maybe a snowflake on your tongue.

33:16.642 --> 33:18.383
BAU BAU!

33:21.904 --> 33:26.828
The question of Christmas Day, we have De-den!

33:27.289 --> 33:29.250
Hello FUWAMOCO!

33:29.330 --> 33:35.095
Been wondering since you played White Album, how many VMs did you both start but never finished?

33:35.535 --> 33:39.759
The way you talked about this made it sound like the list was pretty long.

33:40.379 --> 33:49.525
I don't know, you know, I think this is a very good question because the holiday season, I feel like it's actually a good time, a really good time to play visual novels.

33:50.406 --> 33:51.066
But you know what?

33:52.580 --> 33:53.441
Wait how long?

33:54.401 --> 33:57.543
As we said and talked about before, we haven't finished!

33:58.504 --> 34:04.527
As you know, Fuwawa got a bit discouraged because the RNG was pretty frustrating at times.

34:05.048 --> 34:10.251
And you know, guard dog training, it gets in the way a bit, huh?

34:10.811 --> 34:18.676
To be honest, you know, there are so many amazing visual novels out there that we wanted to play for many dog years.

34:19.156 --> 34:26.042
And we've played bits here and there, but Guard Dog Training takes a lot of time.

34:26.462 --> 34:33.227
So even when we start one game, we aren't really able to play it very often.

34:33.307 --> 34:39.032
And then, you know, so a lot of times we just can't quite get to the ending of a room.

34:39.052 --> 34:40.373
We can't quite complete it.

34:41.154 --> 34:42.775
It's awful, right?

34:43.686 --> 34:48.651
But our feelings towards them don't change at all.

34:49.251 --> 34:51.093
It's just life that gets in the way.

34:51.514 --> 34:58.120
And on the bright side, that just means there are a lot of amazing VMs we still have to enjoy.

34:58.140 --> 35:02.865
Just like any games or books or hobbies or things.

35:03.085 --> 35:05.627
But as for how long the list is...

35:08.288 --> 35:10.190
We don't want that!

35:11.030 --> 35:11.431
Yeah, so...

35:26.723 --> 35:27.865
It's a long list.

35:27.885 --> 35:29.707
BAU BAU!

35:29.767 --> 35:33.451
Thank you for the questions!

35:33.571 --> 35:36.814
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

35:36.854 --> 35:39.297
Your special Christmas submissions!

35:39.317 --> 35:44.042
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.684
It's been like that all the way this year.

35:47.724 --> 35:49.545
And it's not going to change!

35:49.625 --> 35:50.486
It's not going to change.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.367
In 2024, it will be the same too.

35:52.387 --> 35:56.849
So we're looking forward to many more FUWAMOCO Mornings with you.

35:57.669 --> 35:59.951
As well as Doggie of the Day.

36:00.131 --> 36:03.452
Walks, questions, everything.

36:04.293 --> 36:08.095
Thank you for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning with us.

Our next team we have coming up, we have De-den!

36:25.247 --> 36:26.888
Yes, Ruffians!

36:27.369 --> 36:33.674
You shared your most precious, your favorite Christmas memories with us, and now we're going to

36:34.034 --> 36:36.620
Nice and cozy, all together.

36:37.101 --> 36:39.526
And we're gonna enjoy them tonight.

36:39.827 --> 36:40.889
Find a fireplace.

36:41.190 --> 36:41.831
Yeah.

36:41.852 --> 36:44.136
We can have a good couple.

36:45.018 --> 36:50.260
Mococo and I have maybe some Christmas treats too, you know?

36:50.661 --> 36:55.643
Let's have a very warm and nostalgic Christmas Day evening together, okay?

36:56.323 --> 36:57.524
BAU BAU!

36:58.124 --> 37:01.065
And if we take another peek at our schedule... Live Schedule 2023!

37:01.105 --> 37:03.006
You have to use your eyes very well, okay?

37:07.148 --> 37:10.469
You're gonna have to use the binoculars.

37:10.870 --> 37:11.990
The futamagane.

37:12.110 --> 37:13.431
Yes.

37:13.571 --> 37:14.231
Yeah.

37:14.671 --> 37:16.832
It's a crazy end of the year.

37:17.092 --> 37:18.153
Please spend it with us.

37:19.893 --> 37:25.956
You know, there's a lot going on so surely you can find something that you think stands out.

37:26.096 --> 37:28.937
That you have to be there for.

37:29.317 --> 37:30.718
Watch interesting stuff.

37:31.118 --> 37:34.399
We don't know what the week is gonna have for us.

37:34.879 --> 37:35.800
But all we can say

37:36.560 --> 37:37.361
It's gonna be fun.

37:39.101 --> 37:41.143
