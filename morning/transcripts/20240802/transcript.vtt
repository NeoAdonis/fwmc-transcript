Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:11.249
Is that really loud?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.170
BAU BAU!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.750
BAU BAU!

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.594
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.316
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:26.138
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:27.499
BAU BAU!

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:29.640
Too quiet now.

00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:31.501
Louder!

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.102
Like this!

00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:33.894
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:37.176
One more time, okay?

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:37.396
Okay.

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:39.637
Moco-chan, can we do the thing where we jump out again?

00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:40.297
Oh, okay.

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:41.478
One second.

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:43.899
Okay.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.659
Okay.

00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:50.982
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:55.003
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:55.404 --> 00:05:56.864

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.247
Are you sure it's not too loud?

00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:02.447
No!

00:06:07.178 --> 00:06:09.258
I love his ears dying.

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:10.299
BAU BAU!

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.339
BAU BAU!

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:12.800
High five!

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.061
Well, hopefully it's good now.

00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:29.624
Well, now that we're not destroying the Ruffians.

00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:31.445
Ruffians!

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:36.248
Today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:39.030

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:46.053
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 113th episode!

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:47.094
BAU BAU!

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:51.456
We're not super loud today!

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.057
You never know what's gonna happen.

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:56.098
It's a lovely day and we got more fans!

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:56.958
BAU BAU!

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:14.165
For Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:17.666

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:34.183
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:34.944
BAU BAU!

00:07:38.288 --> 00:07:39.789
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:42.149
Yeah, it's short format.

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:42.750
Thank you.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.850
It is!

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.330
I will show you how short it is.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.151
Okay.

00:07:46.171 --> 00:07:48.891
BAU BAU!

00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:52.252
It just started!

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:58.154
Today's FUWAMOCO Morning just started, but the week is coming to a close, right?

00:07:58.174 --> 00:08:00.135
But that doesn't mean that the fun is over!

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:01.155
No!

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:04.276
And how are we gonna have fun this weekend, Moco-chan?

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.577
We're gonna start with

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:09.362
Pero Sighting.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.883
That's not fun though.

00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:14.163
Is that fun, Ruffians?

00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:20.345
I'm asking seriously right now.

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:20.885
No.

00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:23.046
The Ruffians say no.

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:23.746
No.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:24.606
No.

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:25.746
Yeah.

00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:26.846
Yes.

00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:27.567
Yes.

00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:28.727
Yes, it's surprising.

00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:30.167
Yes, it's fun.

00:08:30.647 --> 00:08:31.428
Nuh-uh.

00:08:32.088 --> 00:08:34.668
Well, let's hear it here this time!

00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:35.208
Okay.

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.749
Okay.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.189
De-den.

00:08:41.184 --> 00:08:41.645
De-den!

00:08:43.946 --> 00:08:50.531
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:54.214
Seems like Pero wasn't seen anywhere.

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:55.915
Ruffians.

00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:58.797
Is this our fault?

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:03.646
Well, we're safe today.

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:04.527
Well, that's good.

00:09:04.547 --> 00:09:08.908
You know, now we're into our second year here at hololive.

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:12.889
Maybe... Maybe this is a year without Pero.

00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:15.249
I don't know.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.210
Tell the truth.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.251
I feel kinda sad, you know?

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:22.991
I don't know.

00:09:24.232 --> 00:09:25.212
Feels a little bit...

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:28.698
It'll be okay.

00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:31.660
We're strong demon guard dogs, right, Moco-chan?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.321
We are the BAU BAU team by ourselves!

00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:34.042
Yeah.

00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:35.823
BAU BAU.

00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:36.563
BAU BAU!

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:39.025
Let's not think about those things.

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:39.906
Yeah, no.

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:40.226
Yeah.

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:43.368
BAU BAU!

00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:43.969
BAU BAU!

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:45.130
FUWAMOCO for you!

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:51.334
Yeah, like I mentioned, we are now officially into our second year here in hololive!

00:09:51.414 --> 00:09:56.338
Because just the other day, we celebrated our first anniversary!

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:57.499
BAU BAU!

00:09:59.607 --> 00:10:01.709
It was big, huh?

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.572
I don't know, you know what?

00:10:04.112 --> 00:10:07.036
I'm just so happy to be able to celebrate it together with you.

00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:10.340
Already one year has gone by.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.466
I don't know, it still doesn't really connect.

00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:17.857
I feel like every day I'm like, how?

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:20.159
How am I so lucky, huh?

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:20.959
Right.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:29.866
But I think now, now that we've been at hololive for one year, I think now we're starting to feel... I remember hololive.

00:10:29.886 --> 00:10:30.087
Me too.

00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:30.367
Me too.

00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:30.807

Me too.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:34.830
Me too.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.990
Me too.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.151
Me too.

00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:35.351
Me too.

00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:35.531
Me too.

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.031
Me too.

00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:36.372
Me too.

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:36.632

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:37.392
Me too.

00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:37.613
Me too.

00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:37.773
Me too.

00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:37.973
Me too.

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:38.633
Me too.

00:10:38.653 --> 00:10:38.954
Me too.

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:39.474
Me too.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:39.654
Me too.

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:40.054
Me too.

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:40.195
Me too.

00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:40.395
Me too.

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:41.075
Me too.

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:41.295
Me too.

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:41.436
Me too.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:41.596
Me too.

00:10:41.656 --> 00:10:41.816
Me too.

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:41.996
Me too.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:42.136
Me too.

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:42.296
Me too.

00:10:42.316 --> 00:10:42.456
Me too.

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:42.636
Me too.

00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:42.857
Me too.

00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:43.077
Me too.

00:10:43.117 --> 00:10:43.337
Me too.

00:10:43.357 --> 00:10:43.557
Me too.

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:43.797
Me too.

00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:43.938
Me too.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:44.138
Me too.

00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:44.318
Me too

00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:46.465
I don't know.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.488
The brain is gonna burst.

00:10:52.008 --> 00:10:52.848
It's BAU BAU.

00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:56.450
And BAU time hasn't helped yet either.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:56.970
No.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:04.193
But Ruffians, we really just can't wait for another year filled with precious memories.

00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:11.497
Precious memories that we're able to make so precious because of you here with us, Ruffians.

00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:13.763
Thank you!

00:11:13.783 --> 00:11:16.365
We're gonna keep on protecting your smile!

00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:17.206
But!

00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:22.590
In case Ruffians, you know, there's a bunch of Ruffians I think a little bit busy.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:29.616
Maybe you wanna know just what kind of exciting things we're up to in our first anniversary celebration!

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:37.062
Well, it wouldn't quite be FUWAMOCO without us singing a bunch of our favorite songs this time!

00:11:37.122 --> 00:11:40.004
Special songs, you know, that we sung back when we

00:11:40.184 --> 00:11:41.825
First debut!

00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:46.948
But we did sing Sirens!

00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:48.769
Sirens!

00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:52.191
And of course we also looked over our debut as well!

00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.713
That was something.

00:11:54.773 --> 00:11:55.774
Nervous, FUWAMOCO.

00:11:55.954 --> 00:11:57.315
Can you do an introduction?

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.047
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:12:02.648 --> 00:12:05.552
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.636
Together we're FUWAMOCO!

00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:10.158
BAU BAU!

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:13.523
Yeah.

00:12:13.563 --> 00:12:13.803
Yeah.

00:12:14.163 --> 00:12:22.626
I think we're much, much more FUWAMOCO-y about being comfortable here with the FUWAMOCOs now.

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:22.826
Right!

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:23.546
Yeah.

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:24.606
BAU BAU!

00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:25.766
BAU BAU!

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.707
Yeah, a little bit low-key, low-edgy.

00:12:27.787 --> 00:12:29.087
Low-tension one.

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:30.388
Yeah.

00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:30.468
But!

00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:32.588
But!

00:12:32.908 --> 00:12:38.730
You know, we also revealed first anniversary merchandise!

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:42.532
Let's take a look, okay?

00:12:42.552 --> 00:12:44.193
We have Icomochi-mama!

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:45.554
Icomochi-mama juice!

00:12:45.614 --> 00:12:49.376
BAU BAU!

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:50.397
Let's take a look, okay?

00:12:50.557 --> 00:12:55.039
So this is the complete set of our first anniversary merch.

00:12:55.059 --> 00:13:01.743
We have our Happy Puppy Happy, our BAU BAU Whiskey Chain Pero plushie, FUWAMOCO glass set, and the bonus.

00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:02.863
Close up.

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:03.043
See?

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:03.864
Right here!

00:13:04.464 --> 00:13:16.573
Wow, for the Ruffians, you know, some Ruffians are able to get their paws on the limited edition, which comes with a handwritten autograph of both myself, Moco-chan, too!

00:13:16.613 --> 00:13:18.275
FUWAMOCO!

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:19.416
Together!

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:24.119
And for Ruffians, you know, so I want the complete set!

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:27.222
It comes with a duplicated foil stamp autograph as well.

00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:28.823
Which is very, very nice to me.

00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:32.105
Yeah, so you'll be able to display that, and you know...

00:13:34.207 --> 00:13:35.828
How was that?

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:38.731
Yeah, here's our happy puppy!

00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:40.792
Is this the first time you've seen a happy before?

00:13:40.813 --> 00:13:44.215
It's definitely not the first time you've seen a happy puppy, huh?

00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:45.296
Yeah, no, definitely not.

00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:52.982
But a happy is something that you can wear at live performances and cheers or conventions, you know?

00:13:53.963 --> 00:14:00.673
I know anyone will see you from like a mile away and be like, oh, that's a Ruffian, huh?

00:14:00.733 --> 00:14:05.440
It's very, very cute, especially because of Icomochi-mama's illustration.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.324
And you know, they're very particular about the designs.

00:14:08.905 --> 00:14:09.245
Yes.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.427
So please take a look at it.

00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:16.729
It's gonna be very fluffy and fuzzy.

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:18.950
We wanna see all your happy looking!

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.012
We wanna see just how happy puppies you are, Ruffians, wearing the happy puppy outfit.

00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:23.532
BAU BAU!

00:14:23.712 --> 00:14:24.873
And next!

00:14:25.453 --> 00:14:27.896
Yeah, the BAU BAU voice teacher!

00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:31.881
With a super cute illustration by Reriko-san!

00:14:31.941 --> 00:14:35.285
And there's six original voice recordings in it!

00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:37.668
I wonder what it could be, huh?

00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:39.970
But you can bring us with you everywhere!

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.371
Everywhere!

00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:42.053
We'll protect your smile!

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:45.177
When you're feeling a bit like, uh, my BAU BAU voice is not good!

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:47.967
Just press it and it'll be there.

00:14:48.148 --> 00:14:49.869
With the original voice.

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:50.870
The greetings!

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.272
They all have to find out what they are.

00:14:53.672 --> 00:14:54.493
BAU BAU!

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:55.434
And next!

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:57.395
Nasty.

00:14:59.757 --> 00:15:00.058
Nasty.

00:15:00.518 --> 00:15:03.260
Ruffians, you really wanted a Pero plushie.

00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:04.561
Here it is!

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.144
It's unfortunately terribly cute.

00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:09.185
And it's life-size.

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:10.727
Pero life-size.

00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:13.576
He'll be so perilous.

00:15:13.616 --> 00:15:16.739
He's a bit bigger than the Ruffians, but, uh, yeah.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:20.142
Unfortunately, I came out really, really cute.

00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:21.202
He's round.

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:22.724
He's too cute.

00:15:22.824 --> 00:15:23.845
I'm very cute.

00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:24.185
Yeah.

00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:26.220
One peron, yes.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.562
So you want to make sure that you bring home your own peron pussy!

00:15:29.682 --> 00:15:32.344
So that you can kick it and punch it and point it!

00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:35.406
Do whatever you want with violent toys.

00:15:35.506 --> 00:15:36.046
Violence.

00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:37.227
Extreme violence.

00:15:37.347 --> 00:15:38.728
Extreme violence!

00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:40.169
So it's a cute peron pussy.

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:41.210
Yeah!

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.533
And next, we have the FUWAMOCO glass set!

00:15:45.793 --> 00:15:48.935
You can drink two different types of drinks at the same time.

00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:49.215
Yeah!

00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:52.157
If you forgetful, or you know a glass and then Mocococo.

00:15:52.757 --> 00:15:54.819
Water in one, tea in another.

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:58.061
Milk in one, orange juice in the other.

00:15:58.081 --> 00:15:59.202
Maybe not that.

00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:02.612
You won't get confused, right?

00:16:02.632 --> 00:16:03.913
They're very different drinks.

00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:05.074
Yeah!

00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:08.536
Yeah, but you can drink from them while having a donut.

00:16:08.597 --> 00:16:10.878
Yeah, we're watching us here.

00:16:10.898 --> 00:16:15.782
So you know, first thing in the morning, you gotta have an ice coffee during FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:16:15.802 --> 00:16:16.883
You can choose.

00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:19.105
Oh, today it's gonna be the Fuwawa glass.

00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:24.229
Maybe on the Wednesday, FUWAMOCO Morning, the Pup Talk, you drink out of the Moco-chan glass.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.711
It's up to you!

00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:31.573
And that's our anniversary!

00:16:31.613 --> 00:16:33.254
We still on sale!

00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:38.537
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for getting your paws on the limited edition set!

00:16:39.017 --> 00:16:43.819
We're so excited for you to be able to take a look at our signatures.

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:47.821
We're gonna put a lot of our hearts into them!

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:51.163
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:16:51.223 --> 00:16:52.164
But that wasn't it!

00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:53.204
That was a surprise.

00:16:54.905 --> 00:16:56.527
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:18.007
The most surprising, the most exciting thing happened!

00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:19.328
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:22.451
We released our first original song!

00:17:22.471 --> 00:17:23.192
Yeah!

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:24.033
BAU BAU!

00:17:24.353 --> 00:17:27.777
The song is titled, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★!

00:17:27.837 --> 00:17:28.357
BAU BAU!

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.033
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:50.290
Ruffians, despite what you think, it's very nice and high quality.

00:18:12.762 --> 00:18:13.743
This is not our 3D debut.

00:18:13.803 --> 00:18:16.626
It's not our 3D debut.

00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:18.188
Wait, they dance!

00:18:18.248 --> 00:18:19.188
Yes, they dance!

00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:21.291
With FUWAMOCO, of course they dance!

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.122
Please don't get confused, that is still yet to come.

00:18:27.963 --> 00:18:33.987
But now Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★ is streaming on music platforms everywhere!

00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:36.288
So you can listen to it wherever you want!

00:18:36.728 --> 00:18:41.071
Please go and pick your favorite service, pick the place you listen to music.

00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:43.532
Favorite it and listen, and listen, and listen, and listen.

00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:46.994
Please, Ruffians!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:51.157
And also, we had a bit of an afterparty for the rest.

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:53.279
Yeah, what did we do at the after party?

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:57.021
Yeah, there was a complete doggy boot camp.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:58.743
Yeah, training session.

00:18:58.783 --> 00:19:04.027
Yeah, and we taught all of Ruffians how to cheer the best way possibly for us.

00:19:04.047 --> 00:19:05.048
Doing calls.

00:19:05.168 --> 00:19:09.291
Yeah, you know, calls is something that they do at idol performances a lot.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:13.855
And there's a lot of places where you can BAU BAU and FUWAMOCO.

00:19:14.415 --> 00:19:14.955
Dang it.

00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:20.459
So we wanted to do it all together with you Ruffians so that you'll be ready wherever you go.

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:24.281
And maybe like, uh... Now?

00:19:24.401 --> 00:19:25.002
Now!

00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:26.422
We'll do it now!

00:19:26.523 --> 00:19:29.544
Let's do it once more right now, okay?

00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:31.526
Okay, Ruffians!

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:34.648
I know it's first thing in the morning, but... Are you ready?

00:19:34.668 --> 00:19:35.748
Are you ready?

00:19:35.768 --> 00:19:37.709
Yeah, right now, right now!

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:38.170

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:38.730
Okay!

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.151
Okay, Ruffians!

Yeah, I know it's all of a sudden first thing in the morning, but... But basically, you know, it's like a... What's it?

00:23:44.484 --> 00:23:46.025
A radio exercise?

00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:46.505
You know?

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:47.005
Right, right.

00:23:47.465 --> 00:23:49.567
Punch to the left, punch to the right.

00:23:49.587 --> 00:23:51.970
It's still not quite in your head yet, that's fine.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.970
That's okay.

00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:54.272

00:23:54.312 --> 00:23:57.695

It's pretty catchy, you know?

00:24:16.242 --> 00:24:18.583
You know, I'm actually sort of curious.

00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:18.903
Oh?

00:24:19.603 --> 00:24:22.263
I feel like it'd be cool to have a metal version.

00:24:22.663 --> 00:24:23.264
A metal?

00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:24.664
Yeah, a metal version.

00:24:28.344 --> 00:24:28.644

00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:29.225
Oh.

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.563
Maybe the Ruffians have to take care of that!

00:24:36.643 --> 00:24:37.204
Heck yeah!

00:24:37.224 --> 00:24:41.230
How does the heck time become like sweet time?

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.414
I don't know.

00:24:45.676 --> 00:24:48.360

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.941

BAU BAU!

00:24:58.885 --> 00:25:03.607
With all that excitement, there's also been something exciting going on too!

00:25:04.388 --> 00:25:09.451
Lots of us hololive members, we're a part of HoloARC!

00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:11.672
We're playing a game called ARC.

00:25:11.712 --> 00:25:16.075
You know, with the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs, and more dinosaurs.

00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:19.276
Together with a bunch of my senpai in a huge event!

00:25:20.437 --> 00:25:25.179
Members from JP, members from EN, like us, Karina-chan.

00:25:25.199 --> 00:25:26.560
Yeah, me too.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.901
It was so much fun!

00:25:28.921 --> 00:25:33.543
We got to have our dinosaurs, and then we did big raids all together.

00:25:33.624 --> 00:25:38.246
Yeah, but on the very last day, the final day, we fought a new dinosaur.

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:40.947
It's not a dinosaur, really.

00:25:41.327 --> 00:25:42.608
It's a snowy owl.

00:25:43.451 --> 00:25:44.651
Dinosaur.

00:25:44.792 --> 00:25:45.612
It's a funny story.

00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:46.672
It's very cute.

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.353
I guess it's a dinosaur.

00:25:48.373 --> 00:25:53.034
We were part of the healing team, which is us and Hiroha-senpai.

00:25:53.054 --> 00:25:57.996
Hiroha-senpai was an amazing, amazing leader for it.

00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:02.178
We were able to heal both Jumai-senpai!

00:26:02.218 --> 00:26:05.879
We did well and we beat the final raid too, even though it was a bit tough.

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:07.581
It was really scary.

00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:08.382
Really silly.

00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:09.322
I was like, oh, it's done.

00:26:09.342 --> 00:26:10.183
No, it's not.

00:26:10.203 --> 00:26:14.087
Suddenly, right before the radio, the dinosaurs are busy taking a bath.

00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:15.469
They're still having dinner.

00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:17.489
What's with that?

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.130
Huh?

00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:18.991
Huh?

00:26:20.132 --> 00:26:20.532
Huh?

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:22.174
Here I am waiting.

00:26:23.095 --> 00:26:23.675
Waiting!

00:26:23.775 --> 00:26:31.963
Because we got to talk with Yuruha-senpai a bunch about our favorite ice creams and tea ceremony and a bunch of silly things.

00:26:32.403 --> 00:26:38.789
But we were just so happy because even though it was a pretty tricky game, we were complete beginners in everything.

00:26:39.329 --> 00:26:42.550
We were just so happy to be able to get to know our senpai more.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.151
We were able to get closer and bond and everything.

00:26:47.751 --> 00:26:50.052
You know, that wasn't cool.

00:26:51.232 --> 00:26:55.254
The dinosaurs are cute, but our senpai were cuter.

00:26:55.274 --> 00:26:56.594
But next time, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:26:57.014 --> 00:26:58.895
Our dinosaurs.

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.704
We should get them with our own paws, you know?

00:27:08.264 --> 00:27:09.465
Oh, I don't know how!

00:27:09.765 --> 00:27:12.306
They were given to us by our senpai.

00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:12.726
Yeah.

00:27:12.786 --> 00:27:14.327
They're like, oh, I have something cute.

00:27:14.387 --> 00:27:16.168
Give it to FUWAMOCO, you know?

00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:16.728
Yeah.

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.449
I'm happy, but... I appreciate it.

00:27:18.709 --> 00:27:22.271
We need to show that, you know, we're independent demon dolls.

00:27:22.311 --> 00:27:22.871
Yeah.

00:27:23.091 --> 00:27:24.792
We're self-sufficient, right?

00:27:24.812 --> 00:27:25.552
Hand-me-downs.

00:27:26.313 --> 00:27:27.393
No, they weren't hand-me-downs.

00:27:27.413 --> 00:27:28.534
They were presents, okay?

00:27:28.554 --> 00:27:31.135
Precious, precious presents, yeah.

00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:36.221
But I really hope that we can play a game together again soon.

00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:37.904
It was really fun.

00:27:38.164 --> 00:27:40.387
You know, just like the spelling bee was.

00:27:40.407 --> 00:27:43.511
I hope we can do more big collabs soon!

00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:44.232
BAU BAU!

00:27:45.937 --> 00:27:50.838
Thank you to Pekora-senpai and to all the staff that helped organize it.

00:27:51.318 --> 00:27:53.339
Thank you, thank you!

00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:56.239
BAU BAU!

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.900
And well, you know what?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.901
That was one thing that we did in summer here that was very fun.

00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:03.961
But the summer still continues!

00:28:03.981 --> 00:28:05.202
It's still young!

00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:15.624
And to continue the funness of summer, not just the summer of Advent, but hololive city has now started!

00:28:16.004 --> 00:28:17.986
BAU BAU!

00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:20.408
Ruffians, do you remember hololive City?

00:28:20.488 --> 00:28:24.191
We talked about it briefly before, but maybe it's a bit hard to remember.

00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:26.793
A few months ago we talked about it.

00:28:26.813 --> 00:28:34.219
hololive City is basically hololive teaming up together with a bunch of theme parks all across Japan.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.821
Greetings, hololive city.

00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:38.302
This is an amazing collab!

00:28:38.722 --> 00:28:50.728
And this time, FUWAMOCO, we're part of hololive city and we're representing hololive at Tokyo Dome City Attraction!

00:28:51.028 --> 00:28:52.789
Look at all our senpai!

00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:53.369
Amazing!

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.751
FUWAMOCO

00:29:13.777 --> 00:29:21.640
We're just so happy because we've seen a bunch of Ruffians, you know, having fun running around Tokyo Dome City, eating our shaved ice.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.681
Yeah, the FUWAMOCO shaved ice!

00:29:23.721 --> 00:29:25.042
And BAU BAU donuts!

00:29:25.122 --> 00:29:26.802
Yeah, we have BAU BAU donuts!

00:29:26.942 --> 00:29:29.243
They're super cute!

00:29:29.964 --> 00:29:35.066
And actually, you know, we've seen some Ruffians be like, I wanted to get the donuts, but...

00:29:35.786 --> 00:29:38.347
I wasn't able to get my paws on them.

00:29:38.727 --> 00:29:40.348
They sold out.

00:29:40.368 --> 00:29:41.528
I'm sorry.

00:29:42.209 --> 00:29:47.671
But the shaved ice is very fluffy, very fuzzy, so we recommend that too.

00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.032
But, you know, that's not just the Ruffians.

00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:57.555
There's actually more Ruffians saying that, oh, I can't get my paws on FUWAMOCO's merchandise.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:05.133
Somehow, some of our merch is already sold out despite it being the second day of the event.

00:30:05.514 --> 00:30:07.839
Why are our acrylic stands going high?

00:30:09.901 --> 00:30:11.582
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:30:11.662 --> 00:30:13.563
We're really sorry!

00:30:13.643 --> 00:30:17.146
We're really sorry, Ruffians, for couldn't get done.

00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:20.208
Yeah, we really hope that there's a restock soon.

00:30:20.448 --> 00:30:24.210
And also, a lot more Ruffians can get their paws on us too!

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:30.074
And then we can travel all together around Tokyo Dome City attractions!

00:30:30.674 --> 00:30:31.435
It's gonna be fun.

00:30:32.295 --> 00:30:36.878
Also make sure that you go on our rides of Hoppin' Droppin'.

00:30:37.138 --> 00:30:39.240
It's not a kid's ride.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.781
Droppin' is scary.

00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:42.062
It's serious, okay?

00:30:42.302 --> 00:30:45.844
And on that way, you can also hear us BAU BAU!

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:46.665
BAU BAU!

00:30:46.685 --> 00:30:47.565
While you ride it.

00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:48.826
And maybe some music as well.

00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:51.508
Huh?

00:30:51.568 --> 00:30:53.710
Lots and lots of fun secrets!

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.452
If you're visiting Tokyo, please come on by!

00:30:56.473 --> 00:31:07.202
The hololive city is going to be here until September, so hopefully you know if you have a fun summer trip coming up, you can stop on by!

00:31:07.342 --> 00:31:09.804
BAU BAU!

00:31:10.564 --> 00:31:11.065
I'm so excited.

00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:13.947
I want to see even more photos of FUWAMOCO!

00:31:13.987 --> 00:31:15.047
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it!

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.288
Would you ride that ride?

00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:16.848
Yes!

00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:17.689
Of course!

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:18.690
Hoppin' droppin'.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.190
Of course!

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.591
FUWAMOCO would ride that ride.

00:31:20.611 --> 00:31:22.192
You can't just leave droppin' like that.

00:31:22.212 --> 00:31:22.652
No!

00:31:22.852 --> 00:31:23.613
He's hoppin'.

00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:24.393
He's hoppin'.

00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:25.834
You have to be hoppin' too!

00:31:25.974 --> 00:31:26.354
Yeah.

00:31:26.654 --> 00:31:28.255
Hop on to droppin'.

00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:28.936
Yeah.

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:30.817
Yeah.

00:31:30.877 --> 00:31:34.359
But, speaking of hoppin', I'm kinda hoppin' down.

00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:40.083
Excitement and nervousness, because... Advent's 3D debut is...

00:31:41.742 --> 00:31:42.623
Can you believe it?

00:31:42.643 --> 00:31:53.292
Ruffians, tonight... Tonight is a big day, but you know, it's just a few days after our first anniversary, right?

00:31:53.372 --> 00:31:53.772
Yeah.

00:31:54.473 --> 00:31:57.536
And Advent's 3D debuts are really soon!

00:31:57.596 --> 00:31:58.076
Yeah.

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:05.863
In fact, you know, Biboo, her 3D debut is two days away.

00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:06.163
Two days.

00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:09.406
But, two days, I... It's hard to believe.

00:32:09.987 --> 00:32:10.948
What's even less?

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:12.730
Even closer!

00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:15.233
Shiori's debut!

00:32:15.253 --> 00:32:17.696
That's tonight, Ruffians!

00:32:18.116 --> 00:32:21.259
It's not even 24 hours away, that's tonight!

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.081
Is it 12 hours away?

00:32:23.302 --> 00:32:24.343
I don't even know anymore.

00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:32.320
Ruffians, are you hyped?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.101
Are you excited?

00:32:33.121 --> 00:32:36.503
I am discombobulated.

00:32:36.523 --> 00:32:39.986
It's 11 hours from now.

00:32:43.164 --> 00:32:46.106
Okay, it's not even 12!

00:32:47.947 --> 00:32:48.607
Oh my gosh.

00:32:49.407 --> 00:32:50.468
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:32:50.508 --> 00:32:55.370
Let's get ready to see Shiori in her fully 3D body!

00:32:56.111 --> 00:32:58.732
And see her being all silly, being all squally.

00:32:58.872 --> 00:32:59.713
There, there.

00:33:00.493 --> 00:33:03.614
Whatever other silly Shiori things she says, I don't like it either.

00:33:03.654 --> 00:33:04.915
There'll be lots of them!

00:33:04.935 --> 00:33:06.996
What time is that at?

00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:10.377
It's at 8pm PT!

00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:13.119
Or 12pm JST.

00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:17.921
Make sure you get lots of snacks!

00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:24.824
Shiori's favorite snacks... Shiori's really liked plonder rings recently.

00:33:24.844 --> 00:33:29.706
Shiori, FUWAMOCO, can we get plonder rings?

00:33:31.537 --> 00:33:32.718
Yes, Shiori, we can.

00:33:32.838 --> 00:33:33.819
Yes, yes, yes!

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:36.320
It's at 8pm PT.

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:42.465
I don't think we can get even more hyped than that.

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:44.306
No.

00:33:45.387 --> 00:33:46.608
It's gonna be busy.

00:33:46.708 --> 00:33:48.689
Please get ready, Ruffians!

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.072
Let's all cheer on Shiori, okay?

00:33:53.613 --> 00:33:53.913
Okay!

00:33:54.353 --> 00:33:55.374
BAU BAU!

00:33:55.414 --> 00:33:57.175
I'm so, so excited.

00:33:57.255 --> 00:33:58.176
I can't even believe it.

00:33:58.516 --> 00:33:59.357
It's 4am for you.

00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:00.458
I know it's tough, but...

00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:03.719
3D debut though.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.561
It only happened once.

00:34:06.601 --> 00:34:08.162
3D debut only happens once.

00:34:08.263 --> 00:34:12.706
Ruffians, Yuzu will never tell you to stay up the crazy hours.

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:17.189
But I think 3D debuts.

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:20.231
I think it's worth it.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:24.414
I told somebody we very deeply love Shiori!

00:34:24.975 --> 00:34:26.095
Biboo!

00:34:26.236 --> 00:34:27.797
It's a special special event.

00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.409
BAU BAU!

00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:41.896
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today.

00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:46.939
I feel like I need to see a doggy.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.141
And this is the Doggie of the Day.

00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:50.382
We have... De-den!

00:34:54.748 --> 00:34:58.150
Bomi's a Doggie of the Day!

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:03.033
Bomi's a bundle of... I'm not feeling great though.

00:35:04.365 --> 00:35:06.867
Get better soon, Bomi!

00:35:07.407 --> 00:35:08.307
Get better!

00:35:08.688 --> 00:35:11.729
I'm sure you know Bomi will be back to BAU BAUing.

00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:15.191
I always feel better after being all bundled up.

00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:17.533
Bundled up getting sick of these.

00:35:17.553 --> 00:35:20.214
Then you'll be all ready to go again.

00:35:20.254 --> 00:35:23.256
Bomi looks so nice and fluffy there, too.

00:35:23.776 --> 00:35:25.337
Good eyebrows, huh?

00:35:26.578 --> 00:35:27.978
Ten out of ten, dog!

00:35:27.998 --> 00:35:29.860
Actually, you're mistaken.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.861
Better than that.

00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.502
A thousand out of ten.

00:35:34.812 --> 00:35:36.554
BAU BAU!

00:35:36.614 --> 00:35:39.178
Moco-chan, how does Bomi BAU BAU?

00:35:39.198 --> 00:35:45.646
I think Bomi is probably feeling a little bit down, so maybe like... BAU BAU.

00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:46.587
Very quiet.

00:35:47.128 --> 00:35:49.711
Soon, Bomi will be like BAU BAU!

00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:50.492
BAU BAU!

00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:56.572
I'm looking forward to hearing that BOOMY BAU BAU!

00:35:56.952 --> 00:35:57.473
BOOMY!

00:35:57.533 --> 00:36:01.135
BOOMY is just such a sweet and jolly little purr-purr!

00:36:01.635 --> 00:36:05.138
And we hope you'll be back to full BOOMY level soon!

00:36:05.158 --> 00:36:06.058
BOOMY STRENGTH!

00:36:06.158 --> 00:36:06.839
Yeah!

00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:11.202
We hope you can run around outside in the spring cleaning this summer time here!

00:36:11.262 --> 00:36:12.563
Why do you feel so good?

00:36:13.706 --> 00:36:15.889
Then, well, you may mistake.

00:36:16.269 --> 00:36:19.253
You'll be a fully soggy doggy now.

00:36:19.273 --> 00:36:19.573
BAU BAU!

00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:23.317
See you very soon!

00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:27.923
Well, thanks for our Today I Went On A Walk!

00:36:28.383 --> 00:36:29.585
We have... De-den!

00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:34.864
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.051
But, uh, the bees!

00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:53.611
The bees!

00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:58.692
I'm sure the bees are a little scary, but they're probably just doing a very important job, right?

00:36:58.732 --> 00:37:00.472
Yeah, they're just buzz-buzzing around, huh?

00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:01.152
Yeah, buzz-buzz.

00:37:01.432 --> 00:37:01.972
Buzz-buzz.

00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:03.793
They get close to you, just go BAU BAU!

00:37:03.833 --> 00:37:04.473
BAU BAU!

00:37:04.813 --> 00:37:05.433
That's it.

00:37:05.653 --> 00:37:05.933
Yeah.

00:37:05.953 --> 00:37:11.995
Yeah, but good job for you getting out there to enjoy the lushness around the summer nature!

00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:12.535
Yeah!

00:37:12.575 --> 00:37:13.515
And weather!

00:37:13.535 --> 00:37:15.135
And hopefully you had sunscreen on!

00:37:15.155 --> 00:37:15.335
Yeah.

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:17.236
So do it next time for sure.

00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:17.896
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:21.505
BAU BAU!

00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:22.245
Bees are cute.

00:37:22.265 --> 00:37:22.745
They are!

00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:23.265
They are!

00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:24.166
They're fuzzy, right?

00:37:24.186 --> 00:37:26.807
They're fuzzy, but then they get a bit cold sometimes.

00:37:26.867 --> 00:37:27.968
Yeah, and then they're like, ahh.

00:37:27.988 --> 00:37:29.429
That's when you have to BAU BAU.

00:37:29.449 --> 00:37:30.369
BAU BAU, run away.

00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:31.290
But yeah.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.272
But next, we have our Question of the Day!

00:37:35.392 --> 00:37:36.552
Let's take a look.

00:37:36.892 --> 00:37:38.653
De-den!

00:37:39.194 --> 00:37:41.395
Does Mococo like Mango-chan?

00:37:41.735 --> 00:37:46.337
Both the nicknames and the condiments.

00:37:46.777 --> 00:37:47.418
Mangoes!

00:37:49.694 --> 00:37:50.574
Mangoes are yummy!

00:37:50.674 --> 00:37:51.755
I like mangoes!

00:37:51.775 --> 00:37:54.216
It wasn't asked of me, but I like mangoes!

00:37:54.256 --> 00:37:55.856
What about mango-chan, Moco-chan?

00:37:56.676 --> 00:37:58.277
They yummy.

00:37:58.537 --> 00:38:00.397
But fresh mangoes are better, right?

00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:01.778
I like mangoes.

00:38:02.578 --> 00:38:08.900
But Ruffians... You know, I'm Mococo, right?

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:15.342
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:38:16.423 --> 00:38:18.883
Mococo or Moco-chan is okay.

00:38:18.903 --> 00:38:22.945
But I want people to know my name properly, okay?

00:38:26.546 --> 00:38:27.706
If you change it too much...

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.241
It's not recognizable, you know?

00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:32.802
That makes me a little bit sad.

00:38:33.623 --> 00:38:34.143
Understood.

00:38:34.163 --> 00:38:35.224
Got it.

00:38:35.304 --> 00:38:35.424
Okay.

00:38:36.004 --> 00:38:36.505
I'm Mococo!

00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:36.825
BAU BAU!

00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:37.425
Okay.

00:38:37.445 --> 00:38:38.906
What's the spell, Moco-chan?

00:38:38.946 --> 00:38:40.067
What is the spell?

00:38:40.087 --> 00:38:40.767
Mococo!

00:38:40.787 --> 00:38:41.128

Please send us your doggy of the days, your walks.

00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:08.905
I know you're seeing beautiful things outside.

00:39:09.405 --> 00:39:12.468
Please take a photo for us to see too, okay?

00:39:12.488 --> 00:39:19.214

00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:21.896

00:39:21.936 --> 00:39:25.959

00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:31.544
For our next stream coming up, we have De-den!

00:39:32.665 --> 00:39:34.847
It's Super Chat Week!

00:39:35.027 --> 00:39:37.890
Thank you, Ruffians, for being here!

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:47.477
We're gonna read a bunch of your Super Chats and chat all about, you know, our recent feelings with our song release and our future anniversary and lots of stuff!

00:39:47.497 --> 00:39:48.918

00:39:48.959 --> 00:39:51.621
So we hope you'll be there for a comfy time.

00:39:51.661 --> 00:39:54.243
Just you be there, okay?

00:39:54.303 --> 00:39:55.244
And then after that,

00:39:55.824 --> 00:40:00.765
Wow, if you look at our schedule, Moco-chan, there's something big right after that!

00:40:00.846 --> 00:40:01.266
Right after!

00:40:01.286 --> 00:40:02.846
Shiori's 3D debut!

00:40:02.946 --> 00:40:04.227
Yeah!

00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:05.387
Mama!

00:40:05.427 --> 00:40:14.229
We can't wait, so make sure you get nice and cozy for the super chat meeting, and then get ready for something else in Shiori's 3D debut!

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.010
That's what she has for us, huh?

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:22.152
But, don't forget the next day at the same time, Biboo's 3D debut is happening too, so...

00:40:23.332 --> 00:40:27.253
Let's have a bunch of excitement!

Shiori and Biboo will both have made their CD debut!

00:41:01.674 --> 00:41:02.615
That's crazy!

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:11.704
