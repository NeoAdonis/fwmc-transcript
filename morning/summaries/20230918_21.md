## 👀 Pero Sighting ([06:32](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=06m32s))

[@rengoku_White](https://twitter.com/rengoku_White/status/1702960335039467607) went to the rice fields, where they found Pero pulling some crops.

## ▶️ 2M views for "Kaibutsu" ([09:23](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=09m23s))

FUWAMOCO's [cover of YOASOBI's "Kaibutsu"](https://youtu.be/Yr1EI_jYBB8) has now reached two million views!

## ❌ Misunderstanding ([11:38](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=11m38s))

Or rather "no misunderstandings today". FUWAMOCO seem really proud of that! Ruffians? Not so much…

## 🙇 Apology ([13:23](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=13m23s))

Were there really no misunderstandings, though? Fuwawa has to apologize for [what she said during the Kanji de GO! stream](https://youtu.be/Ugqx0D9hx7k?t=6879)… While she was looking to say "jukugo" (as in 四字熟語, yojijukugo, four-character idiom), she actually said "jukyujo" (熟女, "well-aged lady") ([explanation](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=15m17s)).

## 🙊 Confession ([17:13](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=17m13s))

FUWAMOCO have to confess that, besides all consoles that they mentioned that they had, they also have (or rather "had") Dreamcast. Unfortunately, one day it just disappeared, something that FUWAMOCO are not very fond of…

## 🏆 Today's challenge ([17:38](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=17m38s))

Once again, Mococo is challenged to eat some natto. Brought to you by the hardworking farmers at Tochigi!

## 🐶 Doggie of the Day ([29:39](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=29m39s))

Today's doggie is [FriendlyPunk](https://twitter.com/FriendlyPunk56/status/1701318555697086640)'s Toby, who's recovering from a surgery. We hope he'll get well soon!

## 🚶 Today I Went On A Walk ([31:40](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=31m40s))

[@Yggy87](https://twitter.com/Yggy87/status/1703169377795735608) (Windjammer) went on a walk down the block party they had on their street! Lots of fun for kids (and adults too?) to be had.

## ❓ Question Of The Day ([33:20](https://youtu.be/ySxu81riSGY?t=33m20s))

Answering [Hyorp](https://twitter.com/CascadeHope/status/1703261733601907046)'s question, FUWAMOCO share some good places to go during a trip to Japan (besides Mister Donuts, of course!). Shinjuku Gyoen, Asakusa, Nakamise Street and Skytree/Tokyo Solamachi mall are some of the highlights they shared.
