00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.683
We're so happy to be able to spend

00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:01.608
A new month together with your Ruffians!

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.894
And you know, August was such an amazing time!

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:07.597
Lots of stuff happened!

00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:09.419
Lots of stuff happened the last little bit too!

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.243
Wow!

00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:21.235
For those that are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:22.297 --> 00:06:22.958
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:26.843
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:31.868
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays.

00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:33.709
Once a week.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:34.070

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.065
That was a sighting.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:38.092
Like a... You know, all of hololive English in New York?

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:41.036
Not that kind of sighting.

00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:46.965
I was gonna keep it positive, but... You know, you know.

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:50.730
That was a... A Pero-Pero sighting.

00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:56.138
Start with the nasty news!

00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:56.579
What was it?

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:56.719
Do it.

00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.355
Where was he slated now, Moco-chan?

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:05.060
Let's take a look!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.301
De-den!

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:11.769
Ruffians!

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.494
The boss?

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:18.218
This is a really scary boss!

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.394
Are you sure that's a bus?

00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:22.857
That's a nasty photo.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.242
A nasty bus.

00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:29.389
But, you know, I guess, you know, I've heard that.

00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:31.774
New York City.

00:08:31.874 --> 00:08:36.422
Public transportation, sometimes you see a lot of different things, you know.

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:37.244
Could be dicey.

00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:39.287
Rats.

00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:41.792
A pizza that the bus is over.

00:08:41.772 --> 00:09:03.510
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.362
Sometimes you see Pero too?

00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:07.065
You never know!

00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:10.110
You have to be prepared!

00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.515
The pot's is gliding light!

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:17.020
Mistaken.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:21.588
Hopefully, you know, I think there's a lot of garbage cans in New York.

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:26.796
Maybe Pero finds his way into a garbage can?

00:09:26.936 --> 00:09:28.198
Slam dunk!

00:09:31.435 --> 00:09:32.877
He's everywhere.

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:34.358
You never know.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.580
Look behind you, Ruffians!

00:09:38.442 --> 00:09:40.444
BAU BAU!

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:41.285
What?

00:09:41.606 --> 00:09:42.286
Airport?

00:09:42.306 --> 00:09:43.368
At the airport?

00:09:44.469 --> 00:09:45.830
Why is Pero at the airport?

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.312
You have to check.

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:49.514
Make sure your bags are safe!

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:51.456
Pero could just fly.

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:54.539
You know he has his wings, but... He's nasty.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:58.023
And he's lazy.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.025
Takes the plane.

00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:01.353
BAU BAU.

00:10:02.774 --> 00:10:03.955
BAU BAU!

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:05.957
But speaking of New York... New York?

00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:07.799
What happened in New Yorkcon?

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:12.484
Maybe some Ruffians that aren't... I don't know, things are busy.

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:16.428
It's okay, I'm in the booth.

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:19.231
It's okay, don't feel bad.

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.753
There's something big that happened!

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:21.493
Yeah!

00:10:21.513 --> 00:10:25.177
hololive English, we had our third concert!

00:10:25.197 --> 00:10:25.437
All for one!

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.881
In New York City at Radio City Music Hall!

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.085
It happened on August 23rd and 24th!

00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:34.608
Just recently!

00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.290
Did you see it?

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.650
It happened!

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.254
Thank you for cheering for us so much!

00:10:40.175 --> 00:10:45.241
We had a bunch of fun and amazing show all together!

00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:47.704
And you know what?

00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:51.308
One kid also got all for one t-shirt!

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:54.151
Oh my!

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:54.471
You were there!

00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:54.872
You were there!

00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:55.212
It was epic!

00:10:55.232 --> 00:10:55.733
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:55.753 --> 00:10:57.374
It was the time that we said it all together!

00:10:57.394 --> 00:11:01.539
It was absolutely amazing!

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:06.184
And did you see it?

00:11:06.204 --> 00:11:06.424
My howling!

00:11:06.444 --> 00:11:07.125
Yeah!

00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:07.345
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:10.689
We performed Mio-senpai's original song!

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.190
Yeah!

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.231
Howling!

00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:13.812
For the ones!

00:11:13.832 --> 00:11:14.933
And, uh...

00:11:14.913 --> 00:11:21.722
We also performed Lifetime Showdown for the very first time on the big stage!

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:22.864
But that wasn't it!

00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:25.247
We saw a lot of different songs as well!

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:27.650
And we had lots and lots of different stories!

00:11:28.852 --> 00:11:29.112
Wow.

00:11:29.994 --> 00:11:32.517
I like those FUWAMOCO Morning stories!

00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:42.831
Maybe we could talk about all the other fun things we did behind the stage, you know, backstage, checking around New York, all those things!

00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:44.093
Another time, like,

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:50.634
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:52.536
Have a howl of a day!

00:11:53.237 --> 00:11:56.481
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.982
Have a howl of a day!

00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:01.886
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:01.986 --> 00:12:04.409
Have a howl of a day!

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:08.753
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:15.160
Have a howl of a day!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.610
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:21.704 --> 00:12:33.655
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:37.659
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:40.321
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:41.162
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:41.182 --> 00:12:44.505
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:48.228 --> 00:12:50.310
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:53.286
BAU BAU!

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.910
I know what you're thinking.

00:12:56.491 --> 00:12:59.777
You know, well, FUWAMOCO the princess is every day, right?

00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:01.900
Are you thinking that, Ruffian?

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.982
Right, you're thinking that, right.

00:13:04.264 --> 00:13:04.565
BAU BAU!

00:13:05.126 --> 00:13:05.927
Right!

00:13:06.528 --> 00:13:09.453
But, uh, maybe this is a little bit different.

00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:11.276
A little bit unexpected.

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.159
It was supposed to be.

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:18.726
FUWAMOCO with princesses this time!

00:13:18.746 --> 00:13:20.448
Maybe a little bit selfish.

00:13:20.488 --> 00:13:22.850
Maybe a little bit mean.

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:25.293
Maybe.

00:13:25.594 --> 00:13:29.458
Maybe not the nicest princess in all the princess palaces.

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:32.362
Kingdoms.

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:36.126
But you can check it out on the official hololive shop!

00:13:37.034 --> 00:13:37.975
Preview!

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:43.141
You can preview the English version and Japanese version we recorded in both.

00:13:43.642 --> 00:13:48.848
There's also SP voice too, you can listen to the preview for that.

00:13:48.868 --> 00:13:58.299
But if you haven't listened to our voice pack before, it's like a full drama series with sound effects and everything.

00:13:58.319 --> 00:13:58.840
Lots of stuff going on.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.708
And despite what I have seen, it was not influenced by La+-senpai, no.

00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:13.908
That was well before the plus senpai ever caught us.

00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:18.536
Our acting is good!

00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:18.756
Thank you!

00:14:19.557 --> 00:14:20.940
We're doing our best.

00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:23.824
It was a little bit tricky this time.

00:14:23.844 --> 00:14:24.926
It was really tricky.

00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:28.472
I wonder why FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:14:29.144 --> 00:14:30.325
I did my best!

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:36.011
Please check it out, Ruffians!

00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:39.835
BAU BAU!

00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:40.015
BAU BAU!

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:40.476
Wow, Ruffians.

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:53.349
Speaking of... New... New... New... New things... New horrors... Yeah, uh... Well, Ruffians, you know, right now it's summertime.

00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:57.733
And the summer season is also heavily associated with

00:14:58.861 --> 00:15:13.461
We were not cold, we were very very hot.

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:15.479
FUWAMOCO!

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:22.728
We happened to go to Fuji-Q Highland and Amusement Park.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:28.696
To Japan's most scariest haunted house, Sen'itsumeikyo.

00:15:29.297 --> 00:15:30.859
Because of Fubuki-senpai!

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:30.979
Yeah!

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:36.706
We went to the labyrinth of fear as part of Fubuki-senpai's hololive 4 2025.

00:15:37.247 --> 00:15:40.631
It happened on her channel!

00:15:42.153 --> 00:15:42.233
Yes!

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.863
I don't know, Fuwa keeps up as she said.

00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:53.956
You know we're trying to test our senses as dogs, as canines, human dogs, to, you know, be able to predict when something scary is gonna be.

00:15:53.976 --> 00:15:56.960
It's always better to vote than us.

00:15:58.442 --> 00:15:59.644
I don't know how well I did.

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:04.791
Ruffians, something is very important that did not get included.

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:09.418
Do you know?

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:14.502
How long it takes to go through Sanitsumekyo?

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:17.165
It's the scariest haunted house in Japan!

00:16:17.426 --> 00:16:19.829
It is in an old hospital.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.772
They built the park around the hospital.

00:16:25.135 --> 00:16:27.478
It is 50 minutes long.

00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:29.561
5-0!

00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:30.562
5-0!

00:16:30.662 --> 00:16:31.223
5-0!

00:16:31.243 --> 00:16:33.406
5-0 Ruffians!

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:34.427
Not 5 minutes!

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:55.352
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:56.674
Mio-senpai.

00:16:57.495 --> 00:16:58.416
Hi.

00:16:58.437 --> 00:17:00.079
I trusted mama.

00:17:03.244 --> 00:17:06.709
We went through Senritsumeikyuu all together.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.474
And it was horrible for FUWAMOCO, you know?

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:12.217
You can imagine the screams.

00:17:12.637 --> 00:17:20.749
When we went together with Calli-senpai to Odaiba, we were really stuck to her back.

00:17:21.303 --> 00:17:29.592
Apparently things don't get much better because at the end of it Mio-senpai's back was really really sweaty with her sweat and...

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.401
My sweat.

00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:31.943
Maybe Moco-chan's sweat.

00:17:32.143 --> 00:17:34.026
Maybe my sweat.

00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:36.289
But how did this happen, Ruffians?

00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:39.654
You know, Fubuki-senpai is just like, FUWAMOCO!

00:17:39.674 --> 00:17:44.822
Do you wanna go to maybe a haunted house together with me or Mio-senpai?

00:17:44.842 --> 00:17:44.902
Oh!

00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:46.244
Yeah!

00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:46.825
Let's go!

00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:49.468
Go somewhere with Fubuki-senpai and Mio-senpai!

00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:49.989
Yes!

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.032
Go somewhere together!

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:52.132
Yes!

00:17:52.152 --> 00:17:52.853
That's what we heard!

00:17:52.913 --> 00:17:53.414
Yes!

00:17:53.434 --> 00:17:56.038
Fubuki-senpai knows that we're big, scary cats.

00:17:56.058 --> 00:17:58.161
We're demon dogs, but...

00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.145
So, well, we just said yes.

00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:06.115
And we didn't... We didn't know that there was a haunted house this scary in Japan.

00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:09.722
And that, well... Yeah.

00:18:09.742 --> 00:18:10.222
Yeah.

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:11.645
Yeah.

00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:17.395
If Fubuki-senpai said, let's go to a haunted house, you'd go right, Ruffians?

00:18:17.415 --> 00:18:18.657
You can't say no, right?

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.803
Have you ever been tricked by Fubuki?

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.115
I don't think I played this.

00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:26.760
Well, definitely check it out, okay?

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:32.370
But at first, Fubuki-senpai made the mistake of having us go first.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.273
Fubuki-senpai said, FUWAMOCO, you have to go in the front.

00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:35.856
You have to lead us all.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:39.743
The first ten steps were very, very long.

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:41.566
Yeah.

00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:43.970
Step a minute, right, Moco-chan?

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.611
Step a minute!

00:18:45.112 --> 00:18:45.613
Yeah.

00:18:48.395 --> 00:19:13.828
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:13.808 --> 00:19:14.749
This smells.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.933
It smells like a horse meadow.

00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:18.655
It smells really bad.

00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:20.238
It's all the scents.

00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:23.463
So if you like that thing, you could go check it out yourself.

00:19:23.523 --> 00:19:28.030
But otherwise, go watch Ohuhu Miki-chan's channel!

00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:28.971
Yeah.

00:19:28.991 --> 00:19:30.113
Till you make it out.

00:19:30.515 --> 00:19:32.897
We are still alive, yes.

00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:35.440
It was really scary.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.680
Yeah.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:39.864
But, and you know, Fubuki-senpai was pretty scary too.

00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:42.427
She was, you know, the game master.

00:19:42.927 --> 00:19:48.773
But, she was also really, really nice too because she was like, use the stairs!

00:19:49.394 --> 00:19:50.515
FUWAMOCO make sure to breathe!

00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:54.979
And if Fubuki-senpai didn't do that, I think I might have passed out.

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:57.822
I felt like passing out.

00:19:59.793 --> 00:20:01.475
The stairs were important.

00:20:09.946 --> 00:20:20.839
The stairs are safe!

00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:29.025
One of the silliest points I think was, whenever there was a door, we'd all try to go through it at the same time.

00:20:29.285 --> 00:20:30.487
Just like this!

00:20:30.507 --> 00:20:34.653
And the first couple times it was a little bit awkward, we didn't really say anything.

00:20:34.994 --> 00:20:37.037
We were just all trying to go through!

00:20:37.898 --> 00:20:39.100
And then it happened again!

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.443
And then it kept on happening and happening again!

00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:44.812
Nobody wanted to go first, no one wanted to be left behind.

00:20:44.832 --> 00:20:44.933
Yeah.

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:47.259
I'll go through together.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:48.623
It's all squishing.

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:50.428
Lots of fluff, lots of fuzz.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.554
I'll squish it through the door.

00:20:52.574 --> 00:20:52.935
I can't do it!

00:20:54.282 --> 00:21:15.666
Thank you Mio-senpai for being Moco-chan's shield and sweaty towel.

00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:19.513
Right, we have more stories we can talk about during hololive.

00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:23.840
Oh for one, after party even though it's sort of related, not really related.

00:21:26.925 --> 00:21:29.870
BAU BAU!

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.895
I'm really happy to be a part of it even though it was really scary.

00:21:33.803 --> 00:21:39.574
And speaking of other exciting things!

00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:42.760
Advent!

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.287
Back at the end of July was our 2nd anniversary!

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:55.204
But just the other day, we had our 2nd anniversary 3D Balls!

00:21:55.184 --> 00:21:58.349
We're on the right!

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.833
Ruffians, did you watch?

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:04.699
BAU BAU!

00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:07.463
What did you think of?

00:22:07.483 --> 00:22:14.334
But you know, in 3D Live, we're able to show off some of our driving skills, right Moco-chan?

00:22:14.614 --> 00:22:17.739
You're pretty cool.

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:18.981
Drifting, yeah!

00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:21.445
The zombie was kinda nice.

00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:25.019
I know, the zombie kinda waited for us there.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.265
Except when Shiori almost run it over.

00:22:29.285 --> 00:22:29.805
Yeah.

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:37.677
And we got to kinda show our bathing suits a little bit too, Moco-chan.

00:22:37.697 --> 00:22:39.540
I like spending time on the beach together.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.408
You know, running and being like... We surprised all fans!

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:51.617
You faked it!

00:22:53.504 --> 00:23:00.715
You know, maybe you thought, oh, summer's already over, right?

00:23:00.735 --> 00:23:02.618
It's not over, you'd be surprised.

00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:05.603
Yup.

00:23:05.623 --> 00:23:17.622
And you know, well, we did a bunch of different games and then our faces got a little bit scrambled and maybe things got

00:23:18.682 --> 00:23:20.664
What a funny we became hot.

00:23:20.684 --> 00:23:22.045
Oi dogs, dobermans.

00:23:22.285 --> 00:23:27.750
Dobermans is... That's not what we look like normally, okay?

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.732
That was... That was pokey, okay?

00:23:29.752 --> 00:23:31.674
It's not normal.

00:23:32.555 --> 00:23:33.756
Okay?

00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:36.198
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:40.202
Demon guard dogs, not dobermans!

00:23:40.222 --> 00:23:40.962
Not chihuahuas!

00:23:41.363 --> 00:23:46.107
Nerissa did do a very good job at guiding Biboo and Shiori, huh?

00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:49.744
Follow my voice!

00:23:49.764 --> 00:23:50.446
Follow my voice!

00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:51.107
Follow my voice!

00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:52.249
Follow my voice!

00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:53.652
It's not working!

00:23:53.672 --> 00:23:55.355
It doesn't work, Nerissa!

00:23:57.118 --> 00:23:57.780
Wrong eyes?

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.062
A lot of wrong!

00:23:59.283 --> 00:24:02.248
A lot of wrong Ruffians!

00:24:02.268 --> 00:24:03.150
But you still look cute!

00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:14.605
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:22.601
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:23.203 --> 00:24:29.796
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:45.169
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru.

00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:47.512
Original song series.

00:24:48.013 --> 00:24:50.797
The story of Advent!

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:55.744
This time, you know, Persona, it's a little bit more of a slower song.

00:24:55.764 --> 00:24:56.385
Slow?

00:24:56.405 --> 00:24:57.526
Can you call it slow?

00:24:57.607 --> 00:25:02.273
I think so, you know, compared to Genesis or Balian, it's more upbeat.

00:25:02.674 --> 00:25:02.854
Alluring!

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:28.909
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:32.194
It kind of brings out a lot of different qualities in our voices.

00:25:32.715 --> 00:25:36.261
And maybe you can hear parts of our voices that you haven't heard yet.

00:25:37.463 --> 00:25:42.671
Also, we hope that you'll listen to it lots and maybe we can sing it for you more too in the future.

00:25:42.691 --> 00:25:44.974
Oh, please check it out!

00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:48.300
It's on streaming services, Spotify.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.648
And you can also check the music video on the hololive English official channel too.

00:25:53.628 --> 00:25:55.694
The video's so cool!

00:25:57.117 --> 00:25:57.298
Right!

00:25:57.418 --> 00:25:59.845
I prefer Genesis for now.

00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:03.535
They both play different songs, you know.

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:06.302
Genesis is pretty jazzy.

00:26:06.403 --> 00:26:09.932
Prisoner is different.

00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:16.098
Thank you Ruffians!

00:26:16.439 --> 00:26:20.568
Please continue listening to both Genesis and Prisoner!

00:26:20.588 --> 00:26:22.833
BAU BAU!

00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:30.030
You know we're having a bunch of fun in New York and then right after the weekend afterwards!

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:38.270
Wow, there was a very special 3-day baseball event going on in Taipei, the Taipei Dome.

00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:44.987
It was hololive night with us, FUWAMOCO, Raora, and Gigi!

00:26:45.007 --> 00:26:45.167
BAU BAU!

00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:47.110
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.174
Today we are dancing on the beach of Dragon!

00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:53.199
There's a bunch of cool stuff going on!

00:26:53.219 --> 00:26:57.024
Did you happen to see any of the Ico videos?

00:26:59.768 --> 00:26:59.949
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.412
See there's some photos!

00:27:05.036 --> 00:27:07.219
There's lots of stuff going on!

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.703
And you know...

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:14.130
FUWAMOCO, we did our best together with Gigi and Raora!

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.859
We sang some cheering anthems in Chinese!

00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:20.706
It was very difficult, but we did our best!

00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:25.617
There's cheerleaders that dance to BALADA and ABOVE BELOW too!

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.014
That was a light show for all for one!

00:27:29.034 --> 00:27:32.519
Of course, lots of merch too!

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:35.082
We were so surprised!

00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:35.643
Right!

00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:39.028
That was really fun, right?

00:27:39.048 --> 00:27:40.430
Yeah, the ball doll dance!

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.394
We really liked the choreography for Above Below.

00:27:43.514 --> 00:27:46.558
Yeah, Above Below was so cool too!

00:27:46.538 --> 00:27:50.263
We are really happy.

00:27:50.283 --> 00:27:54.828
Thank you so much to all the fans and everybody who came to cheer and have fun.

00:27:55.189 --> 00:27:56.150
Yeah, came to have fun.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.293
Cheer on the Legion Dragons, you know.

00:27:58.613 --> 00:28:02.218
Just be there for us and Gigi and Laura.

00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:02.818
The girls are so cute.

00:28:02.838 --> 00:28:04.340
I'm glad you thought so.

00:28:05.902 --> 00:28:07.905
Moco-chan, you didn't think the cheerleaders were cute?

00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:09.567
I thought they were cute.

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.228
They're cute.

00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:13.792
But you're missing the second half of your message there.

00:28:14.393 --> 00:28:14.453
Oh.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.685
Did you forget the song we just introduced?

00:28:18.512 --> 00:28:19.077
What?

00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:24.777
It's okay!

00:28:24.797 --> 00:28:24.958
BAU BAU!

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:35.074
FUWAMOCO, you know, even though we don't really know all that much about baseball, we are really, really happy to be there to cheer on the Wing Chun Dragons!

00:28:35.094 --> 00:28:44.830
And it really means a lot to us for you to be there cheering, so thank you so much, FUWAMOCO!

00:28:46.012 --> 00:28:46.212
Thank you!

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.487
More exciting things coming up!

00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:57.754
You might have seen on Twitter, but Ayume-senpai!

00:28:57.774 --> 00:29:02.741
She's gonna be celebrating her 7th anniversary!

00:29:03.021 --> 00:29:06.826
And FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be part of her 3D line!

00:29:06.846 --> 00:29:14.376
Not just that too, she's gonna be unveiling a brand new 3D outfit too!

00:29:14.744 --> 00:29:30.913
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:41.122
But you know, despite being a whole year members, you know, I have a senpai that's like... It's like the tricky song.

00:29:41.142 --> 00:29:42.985
Sing this together with FUWAMOCO.

00:29:43.005 --> 00:29:44.929
So we're gonna do it, guys!

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:45.911
Is it a hot one?

00:29:46.332 --> 00:29:47.914
It's a pretty hot song.

00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:51.501
My mouth feels like it's on fire.

00:29:53.219 --> 00:30:17.134
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:18.419
That's crazy.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.364
For a second there, I thought maybe we were mistaken.

00:30:26.447 --> 00:30:32.773
It makes sense because also there's another big anniversary coming up here too!

00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:43.043
Coming up this weekend, there's a special show going on because it's going to be hololive's 8th anniversary!

00:30:43.063 --> 00:30:43.223
BAU BAU!

00:30:43.203 --> 00:30:51.914
And to celebrate, there's a special fireworks show going on!

00:30:53.236 --> 00:30:53.756
Mahou Hanabi!

00:30:53.776 --> 00:30:55.439
Shining Sparkling Symphony!

00:30:55.659 --> 00:31:00.125
It's gonna be happening at Makuhari-no-hama beach!

00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:04.530
It's gonna be happening on the 6th at 2.30am PT.

00:31:05.011 --> 00:31:06.793
Or 6.30am JST.

00:31:07.514 --> 00:31:13.041
As you can see, it's gonna be hosted by our GenZero here!

00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:15.185
I'm so excited!

00:31:15.225 --> 00:31:15.445
Fireworks!

00:31:15.486 --> 00:31:20.895
So just for hololive you know there's fireworks and hololive night but now fireworks!

00:31:20.915 --> 00:31:21.697
Oh there'll be a stream!

00:31:21.717 --> 00:31:22.518
There is a stream!

00:31:22.578 --> 00:31:31.034
It's available on Zaiko and SPWN but it looks like the website recommends Zaiko for users overseas.

00:31:31.054 --> 00:31:32.717
But you know fireworks

00:31:32.697 --> 00:31:33.338
Fireworks!

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:34.240
hololive fireworks!

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.442
You might be kinda like, huh?

00:31:35.522 --> 00:31:36.925
What's happening?

00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:41.794
Well, there's gonna be a special show, a fireworks show with drones!

00:31:41.814 --> 00:31:41.894
Yes!

00:31:42.214 --> 00:31:47.664
And special programming to celebrate hololive's history from the very beginning until now!

00:31:47.945 --> 00:31:50.029
Also a DJ set!

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:50.790
I think PandaBoY's on it!

00:31:50.770 --> 00:32:13.183
hololive's 8th Anniversary!

00:32:13.163 --> 00:32:31.392
BAU BAU!

00:32:33.548 --> 00:32:44.520
BAU BAU!

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.754
It's our 8th anniversary, FUWAMOCO!

00:32:50.196 --> 00:32:52.179
Happy celebration.

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:55.723
We are really lucky to be part of everything here.

00:32:56.644 --> 00:32:58.527
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

00:32:59.628 --> 00:33:03.593
Well, Moco-chan, September's starting officially the 1st!

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:06.297
What happened?

00:33:06.978 --> 00:33:08.640
I feel like 2020... 2025.

00:33:09.301 --> 00:33:11.844
What were you gonna say?

00:33:11.884 --> 00:33:13.706
What year were you gonna say?

00:33:13.726 --> 00:33:15.148
I was gonna say 2024.

00:33:17.592 --> 00:33:19.636
My pleasure.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.422
How are you feeling Ruffians?

00:33:22.442 --> 00:33:23.725
Are you looking forward to a new month?

00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:26.671
Maybe a little nervous?

00:33:28.235 --> 00:33:28.956
Moco-chan.

00:33:29.497 --> 00:33:35.750
Did you want a pup talk?

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.512
BAU BAU!

00:33:40.964 --> 00:33:42.546
Au revoir!

00:33:43.507 --> 00:33:44.488
Ruffians!

00:33:45.229 --> 00:33:46.510
It's that time again!

00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:49.053
It's that time again!

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.717
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:56.441
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:56.601
Mococo!

00:33:57.862 --> 00:33:59.024
Ruffians!

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:01.626
Ruffians!

00:34:02.628 --> 00:34:03.849
Can you believe it?

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.752
It's already the start of September!

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:16.416
Maybe for you, that means a new adventure to a new school year.

00:34:16.436 --> 00:34:20.463
Or, you know, maybe it's just another start to a new month.

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:26.914
But no matter what, it means that exciting surprises await all of us!

00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:29.178
Although, maybe you don't want to hear it.

00:34:31.482 --> 00:34:37.532
It's officially getting close to the end of the year of 2025.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:45.377
So, let's do our best to take the rest of the year into our own hands and do our best every day!

00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:47.600
Don't be afraid, Ruffians!

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.424
Take a chokehold on the next few months and come out the winner!

00:34:51.945 --> 00:34:52.466
Got it?

00:34:53.206 --> 00:34:54.348
You can do it!

00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:56.691
BAU BAU!

00:35:00.956 --> 00:35:01.877
BAU BAU!

00:35:01.897 --> 00:35:02.237
BAU BAU!

00:35:03.398 --> 00:35:13.013
Let's do our best, FUWAMOCO!

00:35:13.073 --> 00:35:19.684
Let's take a look at some of our regular coordination today, starting with our Doggie of the Day!

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:26.875
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Korone-senpai!

00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:28.777
Morning!

00:35:28.978 --> 00:35:31.461
So cute!

00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:31.981
I see her fluffy ears.

00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:34.084
I haven't seen those before.

00:35:36.287 --> 00:35:36.387
I am!

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:38.109
Really?

00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:38.410
Why?

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.951
You think that she shouldn't be here?

00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:43.536
Do you have a problem with this morning?

00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:46.720
Morning Senpai is not Doggie of the Day material.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.403
Wow, that's horrible, Ruffians.

00:35:49.524 --> 00:35:53.368
I can't believe it.

00:35:53.388 --> 00:35:57.113
Well, you know today's Doggie of the Day is Korone-senpai!

00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:59.236
A doggy girl!

00:36:00.137 --> 00:36:00.217
Yes!

00:36:00.998 --> 00:36:02.279
And she's looking very cute.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.921
Just like everyday.

00:36:05.443 --> 00:36:07.546
But even more so.

00:36:07.606 --> 00:36:09.168
Because she's a Doggie of the Day!

00:36:09.188 --> 00:36:11.090
So she looks cuter today!

00:36:12.732 --> 00:36:14.074
Moco-chan!

00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:18.176
You know, I know Korone-senpai uses this as yubi yubi and other things.

00:36:18.938 --> 00:36:19.599
Other things?

00:36:21.183 --> 00:36:25.053
But how does Korone-senpai bau bau, huh?

00:36:25.073 --> 00:36:28.862
Well, I think there is proof of how she bau baus.

00:36:29.303 --> 00:36:30.105
But...

00:36:31.098 --> 00:36:34.305
I think it's sort of like BAU BAU!

00:36:34.326 --> 00:36:35.147
BAU BAU!

00:36:35.167 --> 00:36:35.348
Really?

00:36:35.408 --> 00:36:37.052
Isn't it more like BAU BAU?

00:36:37.653 --> 00:36:38.916
It could be both!

00:36:38.956 --> 00:36:40.841
BAU BAU!

00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.783
BAU BAU!

00:36:42.164 --> 00:36:43.547
FUWAMOCO BAU BAU!

00:36:44.529 --> 00:36:45.512
Sometimes.

00:36:46.434 --> 00:36:47.436
Sometimes.

00:36:48.496 --> 00:37:04.547
FUWAMOCO

00:37:06.586 --> 00:37:11.913
Korone-senpai was a little bit intimidating at first because you don't really admire her.

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:14.396
We're just newbies, even good dogs.

00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:15.758
It's her second anniversary though.

00:37:16.178 --> 00:37:16.398
But!

00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:20.343
You told her.

00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:22.186
She's super duper sweet.

00:37:22.466 --> 00:37:24.068
Amazing.

00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:30.116
Somehow, she doesn't think that we can bawl bawl away all the things, but she's wrong on that one.

00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:31.537
But we love her!

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:32.779
Yeah.

00:37:33.772 --> 00:37:42.840
BAU BAU!

00:37:47.605 --> 00:37:50.307
It's more her birthday.

00:37:50.347 --> 00:37:52.329
No, she's the Doggie of the Day.

00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:55.151
You don't have to have your birthday to be Doggie of the Day, okay?

00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:55.272
Yeah.

00:37:56.012 --> 00:37:58.234
Yeah.

00:37:58.615 --> 00:38:02.378
Yeah.

00:38:02.358 --> 00:38:04.460
BAU BAU!

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.681
Let's take a look.

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:09.204
You know, Ruffians have been all over the boat recently.

00:38:09.264 --> 00:38:12.987
Let's take a look at... Today, I went on a walk.

00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:17.271
We have... De-den!

00:38:17.291 --> 00:38:17.912
Is this a walk?

00:38:18.532 --> 00:38:21.976
It's a... Discovery meet on a walk, Moco-chan!

00:38:21.996 --> 00:38:23.076
Discovery!

00:38:23.097 --> 00:38:24.278
Do you know what this is?

00:38:24.298 --> 00:38:31.504
It looks like a good snack.

00:38:32.092 --> 00:38:39.769
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:49.290
Have a howl of a day!

00:38:50.907 --> 00:38:53.412
But it looks really cool.

00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:55.355
I wouldn't want to have one on my hand.

00:38:55.936 --> 00:38:57.319
But I think I want to give it a pat.

00:38:58.501 --> 00:38:59.804
If you eat it, it will hurt you.

00:39:00.184 --> 00:39:02.549
It's definitely crunchy.

00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:04.673
Oh, you've tried it before.

00:39:05.454 --> 00:39:07.558
I wonder what it would taste like in a cucumber.

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:09.642
Between two slices of cucumber.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:28.622
I feel like it would be cute to pet one.

00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:31.025
I don't want it going on me.

00:39:31.486 --> 00:39:36.793
I'll eat it and I'll touch it, but I don't want it touching me.

00:39:38.393 --> 00:39:42.413
That's not very fair, did we ask the praying mantis if it wants to be pet Moco-chan?

00:39:42.453 --> 00:39:45.568
It's a snack, it doesn't matter.

00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:47.678
BAU BAU!

00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:51.144
Thank you for sharing a discovery you made on your log!

00:39:53.529 --> 00:39:56.054
BAU BAU!

00:39:56.074 --> 00:39:58.819
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.007
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:40:05.192 --> 00:40:05.733
Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:40:05.753 --> 00:40:08.518
I'm gonna be visiting Japan for the first time really soon!

00:40:08.498 --> 00:40:12.423
Exciting first Japan trip!

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:19.593
Are there any tips or any places you would recommend a first time visitor in either Osaka, Kyoto, or Tokyo?

00:40:19.774 --> 00:40:21.456
It is gonna be hot.

00:40:21.997 --> 00:40:23.759
It's gonna be hot if it's soon.

00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:25.161
It's still very hot.

00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:25.702
I know.

00:40:26.163 --> 00:40:28.366
Ruffians, was New York City hot?

00:40:30.689 --> 00:40:32.031
It was refreshing.

00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:32.832
It was refreshing.

00:40:34.454 --> 00:40:35.856
It was not hot in the slightest.

00:40:36.815 --> 00:40:39.841
Prepare for it to still be hot!

00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:41.844
Get your sunscreen ready!

00:40:43.447 --> 00:40:44.409
Places to go!

00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:45.652
Let's go to Tokyo!

00:40:46.273 --> 00:40:51.342
I think you know what I kind of thought is you should go see Sky Tree!

00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:53.406
Sky Tree is a big, big Sky Tree.

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:55.975
But there's also Soramachi.

00:40:56.055 --> 00:40:57.417
It's a moor.

00:40:57.657 --> 00:40:59.179
There's lots of fun stuff.

00:40:59.199 --> 00:41:01.602
Lots of things to see and do.

00:41:02.062 --> 00:41:04.525
There's also Asakusa nearby.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:06.447
Take a look there.

00:41:06.527 --> 00:41:08.309
Kaminarimon.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.454
And of course you have to make your way to Akihabara.

00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:14.476
No more misto.

00:41:14.576 --> 00:41:21.604
It's probably changing, but Akihabara is a very very special place to FUWAMOCO.

00:41:21.584 --> 00:41:23.688
Forget, forget about the changes.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.272
It's a very special place.

00:41:26.773 --> 00:41:31.161
But you know, maybe you want to check out more subculture, pop culture.

00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:33.565
You can make your way to Nakano Broadway.

00:41:34.527 --> 00:41:35.769
Check out Manarake.

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:42.000
But for Osaka though, FUWAMOCO, we haven't been to Osaka too much yet.

00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:44.284
But there is the...

00:41:44.264 --> 00:41:47.308
Very first miso-do store there.

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:48.389
We haven't went!

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:52.755
You could go and discover it and put it back to us!

00:41:52.935 --> 00:41:55.999
And as for Kyoto, I think Kyoto, just have fun.

00:41:56.219 --> 00:41:59.123
And also realize that it might be very busy.

00:41:59.163 --> 00:42:02.127
You might not be able to see all the things you're expecting.

00:42:02.768 --> 00:42:04.450
So just have fun.

00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:05.731
You know?

00:42:06.993 --> 00:42:07.774
Very busy.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.755
But most importantly, just have fun and enjoy Japan!

00:42:15.396 --> 00:42:17.783
BAU BAU!

00:42:18.264 --> 00:42:22.617
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:42:23.038 --> 00:42:24.582

00:42:24.562 --> 00:42:28.906
Tweet some photos shared with us, especially during your trips to New York.

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:31.388
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:42:31.408 --> 00:42:35.672
We're always looking for new Doggie of the Day's questions.

00:42:36.032 --> 00:42:43.359
Pero sightings, your walks, so please let us know what you've been up to with the hashtag.

00:42:43.379 --> 00:42:44.259
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:50.565
And it could be a part of the next episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:53.187
We're waiting, okay?

00:42:53.207 --> 00:42:53.488
We're waiting!

00:42:53.508 --> 00:42:54.028

Ah, well, we have another stream coming up soon.

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:02.682
We didn't mention it, but... De-den!

00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:04.285
Our FUWAMOCO afterparty!

00:43:04.766 --> 00:43:06.729
We have so much we want to talk about!

00:43:06.749 --> 00:43:07.831
So many stories!

00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:09.594
To share with you!

00:43:09.614 --> 00:43:13.039
Maybe not just the concert itself, but you know, New York stories.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.206
Story stuff with, you know, our senpai, our kouhai.

00:43:17.226 --> 00:43:18.548
What we've been up to.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.792
Senri to make you.

00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:27.139
We have a bunch of things we want to say to you because Ruffians!

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:30.163
You're amazing!

00:43:30.203 --> 00:43:37.431
So we hope that you'll be there Ruffians!

00:43:41.776 --> 00:43:42.257
BAU BAU!

00:43:42.642 --> 00:43:56.304
Wow, for Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... It's BAU BAU September!

00:43:56.324 --> 00:43:56.485

00:44:04.077 --> 00:44:07.823
It was really really nice to be able to start September together with you.

00:44:07.803 --> 00:44:15.596
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:44:16.317 --> 00:44:17.218

00:44:57.584 --> 00:45:04.593
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:45:05.074 --> 00:45:07.758

00:45:08.358 --> 00:45:10.601
