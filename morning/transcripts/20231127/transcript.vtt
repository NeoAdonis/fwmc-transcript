05:08.291 --> 05:10.693
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.134 --> 05:14.597
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.617 --> 05:18.641
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.741 --> 05:21.704
BAU!

05:22.425 --> 05:25.648
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:26.028 --> 05:28.611
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:29.031 --> 05:31.153
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:34.182 --> 05:39.164
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.184 --> 05:41.144
Ruffians!

05:41.564 --> 05:50.887
Today, today, well... Thank you for joining us today for our 49th episode!

05:50.907 --> 05:50.887
49!

05:51.287 --> 05:53.028
That's impressive.

05:56.909 --> 05:59.131
Thank you, Ruffians.

05:59.151 --> 06:03.755
49 episodes, 49 mornings together with you.

06:04.876 --> 06:05.697
It's today.

06:06.558 --> 06:07.959
It's today, yeah.

06:08.559 --> 06:19.469
Well, for Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:19.769 --> 06:20.330
A.k.a.

06:20.390 --> 06:21.311
FUWAMOCO-e.

06:21.511 --> 06:22.592
And is hosted by us,

06:23.152 --> 06:24.532
FUWAMOCO!

06:24.552 --> 06:30.594
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:30.834 --> 06:35.535
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:35.975 --> 06:40.476
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:40.496 --> 06:41.536
BAU BAU!

06:45.525 --> 06:46.225
Another morning.

06:46.245 --> 06:46.886
Hashtag, hashtag.

06:47.626 --> 06:49.307
Ruffians, you don't have to say it like that.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.007
We've gone over this.

06:50.087 --> 06:51.468
We've gone over this.

06:51.548 --> 06:53.809
Now you're just being silly, huh?

06:53.849 --> 06:58.410
FUWAMOCO-chan.

06:59.191 --> 07:01.912
Ruffians, you've been keeping your eyes open for Pero.

07:02.132 --> 07:02.492
I think.

07:03.693 --> 07:04.553
Have you?

07:05.533 --> 07:09.715
Well, it seems like we have another Pero sighting!

07:10.315 --> 07:11.836
Where is he this time, huh?

07:12.516 --> 07:13.817
Not in Florida anymore.

07:17.381 --> 07:19.823
Let's see.

07:19.923 --> 07:20.084
De-den!

07:20.864 --> 07:25.328
Orange!

07:25.608 --> 07:31.573
I see a very cute, long, orange cat!

07:31.713 --> 07:33.414
Cute cat vision.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.569
Oh yeah, Pero's in the image.

07:38.729 --> 07:43.812
He's there, hi.

07:45.353 --> 07:48.014
I see, Pero is the root of all your problems.

07:48.355 --> 07:50.016
All the darkness, huh?

07:50.036 --> 07:50.996
Yeah, sounds familiar.

07:51.036 --> 07:53.198
Shit feels like that for us too, huh?

07:53.938 --> 07:56.159
For the darkness in our lives sometimes.

07:56.379 --> 07:59.501
But it helps to have somebody to blame on the bad things, huh?

07:59.541 --> 07:59.761
Yeah.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.563
Just blame Pero for it all.

08:03.603 --> 08:04.684
Yeah, just blame Pero.

08:05.084 --> 08:08.044
But it looks like you have a good electrician on the job.

08:08.064 --> 08:08.124
Why?

08:09.345 --> 08:10.285
On your hands.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.226
Actually, Ruffians!

08:17.827 --> 08:19.627
Do we ever tell you?

08:20.127 --> 08:23.728
Do you know how Pero feels towards cats, Ruffians?

08:26.929 --> 08:28.029
I wonder, do we?

08:28.129 --> 08:28.609
Do we?

08:29.889 --> 08:30.310
Do we?

08:30.330 --> 08:30.370
No.

08:30.950 --> 08:31.090
No.

08:32.665 --> 08:34.026
No, no.

08:36.508 --> 08:42.553
Ruffians, you know that we really, really, really love cats, right?

08:42.593 --> 08:44.535
Just a bit, just a bit, right?

08:45.636 --> 08:48.438
But Pero, he's...

08:51.184 --> 08:52.865
He's terrified of them.

08:53.185 --> 08:57.127
Petrified.

08:57.507 --> 09:03.850
He's rather approving of our desire to love and kiss and love and kiss and eat cats.

09:05.731 --> 09:07.572
It's nice that he gives us the room to do so.

09:07.632 --> 09:11.034
He doesn't want to be around for that.

09:11.294 --> 09:13.255
We're enjoying cats, pero

09:13.935 --> 09:15.135
He's not, he's not there.

09:15.215 --> 09:17.136
He's gone.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.696
It's nice to have that kind of room that time.

09:19.996 --> 09:21.617
But just us on the cat.

09:24.317 --> 09:30.779
But, you know, we're very confident that the electrician you have there will get the job done in no time, right?

09:31.219 --> 09:34.960
That's probably why Pero's making that face, right?

09:35.020 --> 09:36.360
He sees what's below him.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.141
Doesn't like it, no.

09:39.481 --> 09:42.444
Perified, right?

09:42.785 --> 09:43.926
Perified.

09:43.986 --> 09:45.368
Perified of cats.

09:45.408 --> 09:45.688
Yes.

09:46.149 --> 09:50.834
Well, hopefully you have light again soon.

09:51.414 --> 09:55.839
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a couple little cat punches here.

09:55.919 --> 09:56.740
A paw away.

09:57.661 --> 09:58.242
BAU BAU!

10:03.559 --> 10:05.921
I wish we had that kind of electrician, too.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.182
I need the number.

10:08.022 --> 10:08.423
The number?

10:08.463 --> 10:09.384
Oh, the phone number?

10:09.484 --> 10:09.864
Yes.

10:10.024 --> 10:11.405
I would like a recommendation.

10:11.765 --> 10:12.006
Thank you.

10:12.046 --> 10:12.366
Right?

10:12.406 --> 10:14.067
They can go change the lightbulb.

10:14.167 --> 10:14.628
Right!

10:18.000 --> 10:18.681
That would be good.

10:19.861 --> 10:22.403
Ruffians!

10:22.603 --> 10:27.546
You know, we had something very very happy we decided to share with you.

10:27.586 --> 10:32.469
But I think you know, you might have heard.

10:32.749 --> 10:34.290
Might have heard about it because

10:35.578 --> 10:42.602
We just released a brand new cover song for Twitter Day over the weekend!

10:42.982 --> 10:46.764
The song is Kanaria's "Identity"!

10:46.885 --> 10:49.546
Yeah, it's our first VOCALOID song that we've ever covered.

10:49.646 --> 10:50.247
Right?

10:50.307 --> 10:52.808
What do you think, Ruffians?

10:55.389 --> 10:55.990
You listen?

10:56.010 --> 10:56.790
You like it?

10:57.191 --> 11:01.453
Well, even if he didn't say, it sure seems like it.

11:01.923 --> 11:04.746
Some Ruffians have been listening to it lots, right?

11:05.346 --> 11:06.528
Thank you, Ruffians!

11:06.608 --> 11:08.650
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:09.010 --> 11:15.416
Mama, we talked a bunch about why we picked it, and our feelings about recording it, and the actual meaning and concept of the song.

11:15.596 --> 11:16.697
It's surprising.

11:17.418 --> 11:19.100
I guess also with our interpretation.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.162
So if you listen to our cover, enjoy it!

11:21.442 --> 11:23.904
We'd love if you also check out our afterparty for it.

11:23.965 --> 11:25.306
The afterparty that we had.

11:25.326 --> 11:26.127
We talked a lot.

11:26.527 --> 11:27.288
Don't worry.

11:27.328 --> 11:27.608
Don't worry.

11:27.668 --> 11:28.368
Don't worry.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.009
Don't worry.

11:29.169 --> 11:29.829
I recommend

11:57.653 --> 12:00.634
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:01.394 --> 12:05.835
BAU BAU!

12:06.135 --> 12:10.976
Moco-chan, do you have a way to... I recommend you listen to it like this, right?

12:12.736 --> 12:16.057
Maybe with a cup of tea.

12:16.477 --> 12:18.498
I don't know, maybe it's not a type of cup of tea.

12:18.578 --> 12:18.998
Really?

12:19.018 --> 12:19.818
I don't think so.

12:20.258 --> 12:24.899
I was going to recommend headphones and maybe wear an iPad at the same time.

12:26.710 --> 12:27.690
As a recommendation.

12:28.411 --> 12:30.331
Headphones and an eyepatch, okay?

12:30.772 --> 12:31.252
Yeah.

12:31.592 --> 12:31.832
Yeah.

12:32.692 --> 12:33.333
BAU BAU!

12:33.353 --> 12:34.273
BAU BAU!

12:34.653 --> 12:35.573
Wow!

12:35.673 --> 12:45.017
Not just identity, but I think, you know, it's been an especially happy time for those who love hololive English and music, too!

12:45.297 --> 12:54.881
Yeah, because, you know, the happiness continues because Gura-senpai had a new song released that's written and produced by THE HONEYWAY!

12:54.921 --> 12:55.941
THE HONEYWAY!

12:56.402 --> 12:59.007
It's BAU BAU!

12:59.367 --> 13:04.376
This song is part of the whole honey project that's going on right now.

13:04.777 --> 13:07.923
And it's called Tokyo Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:09.278 --> 13:11.159
Tokyo Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:11.179 --> 13:12.200
Tokyo Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.320
Tokyo Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.461
Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:15.501 --> 13:16.262
Wabi Sabi Lullaby.

13:31.249 --> 13:31.850
How am I?

13:32.010 --> 13:33.691
I thought you were supposed to be good at this, huh?

13:34.472 --> 13:35.312
Not this one.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.233
Not this one.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.194
Wobby, wobby, wobby.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.836
I'd like to see Gura-senpai try.

13:40.116 --> 13:40.737
Challenge!

13:40.817 --> 13:41.297
Yeah.

13:42.378 --> 13:43.919
Formal request of a challenge.

13:44.379 --> 13:50.884
Yeah, but this song, you know, it's very melancholic and even a bit of a sad song too, you know.

13:51.205 --> 13:57.189
Reminding us just how hard it is to say goodbye to a good friend sometimes.

13:57.410 --> 13:59.731
But, you know, it's really emotional.

14:00.732 --> 14:04.316
The video and animation is also really beautiful too!

14:04.356 --> 14:05.037
It's so nice.

14:05.237 --> 14:08.440
We really love the cool city pop vibe of the song.

14:08.460 --> 14:11.864
And you can tell that they put a lot of love and thought into making it.

14:12.204 --> 14:16.648
And make it fit for Gura-senpai and her beautiful voice too.

14:17.329 --> 14:20.252
It feels very different than the usual Sound of Honey like songs.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.314
But we really really like it.

14:25.618 --> 14:28.140
It might just be our favorite song by FUWAMOCO.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.962
Right, right.

14:30.122 --> 14:31.683
What do you think, Ruffian?

14:33.625 --> 14:34.786
Very true.

14:35.147 --> 14:36.168
I like it a lot.

14:36.268 --> 14:37.689
It's very unique, right?

14:38.090 --> 14:40.092
Right.

14:40.412 --> 14:40.732
Yeah.

14:40.812 --> 14:41.233
And you know...

14:42.898 --> 14:56.369
There's also a very special challenge going on right now, where if you make a short video and upload it to YouTube or TikTok, you can receive a special original wallpaper.

14:56.409 --> 14:57.810
Yeah, you just have to use the audio.

14:58.170 --> 14:58.610
Right!

14:59.151 --> 15:06.497
But there's only 10 people who get this special wallpaper, so if you have your eye on that prize, please enter!

15:07.017 --> 15:08.818
Maybe we should enter something first.

15:09.779 --> 15:10.099
Ruffians!

15:35.109 --> 15:37.250
We also hit another milestone!

15:37.270 --> 15:38.591
Another milestone!

15:38.711 --> 15:40.532
Not FUWAMOCO Morning number 50.

15:40.752 --> 15:41.772
That's not today.

15:41.812 --> 15:42.272
Not yet.

15:42.452 --> 15:43.893
Today is number 49.

15:44.473 --> 15:51.477
But we wanted to say a big thank you for 400,000 listens on Cute na Kanojo!

15:51.537 --> 15:52.897
Thank you!

15:52.957 --> 15:57.019
We're so so happy!

15:57.079 --> 15:59.320
So happy!

15:59.660 --> 16:00.261
You know,

16:01.357 --> 16:08.562
I hope that maybe there was more than a few new Ruffians who maybe first met us thanks to this cover song.

16:08.622 --> 16:08.742
Right!

16:09.082 --> 16:13.085
They might kind of think, oh, this FUWAMOCO's kind of cool.

16:13.466 --> 16:15.507
Kind of something else.

16:16.988 --> 16:17.969
Something else!

16:18.629 --> 16:20.791
Right, we're kind of a different FUWAMOCO here, right?

16:20.851 --> 16:24.954
I think maybe a lot of Ruffians think, ah, FUWAMOCO's something else, huh?

16:25.014 --> 16:25.274
Right.

16:27.503 --> 16:29.284
But yeah, it was really really fun to sing.

16:29.324 --> 16:31.126
It's a very special cover to us too.

16:31.446 --> 16:35.368
We hope that we'll be able to show lots of different sides of us.

16:35.408 --> 16:36.209
The cool side.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.230
The something else side.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.332
More in the future.

16:40.352 --> 16:41.633
More sides.

16:41.813 --> 16:43.434
We want to release more music.

16:43.714 --> 16:45.756
Thank you Ruffians!

16:46.681 --> 16:46.941
BAU!

16:46.961 --> 16:47.081
BAU!

16:47.382 --> 16:47.502
BAU!

17:08.303 --> 17:10.044
I'm pretty excited about this.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.747
We kind of went out of our way.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.588
Kind of.

17:14.648 --> 17:15.189
Kind of.

17:15.929 --> 17:22.855
So, we'll be in these BAU BAU lots of missions with you, okay?

17:22.895 --> 17:23.335
BAU BAU!

17:23.435 --> 17:23.635
No.

17:24.396 --> 17:24.616
No.

17:25.897 --> 17:26.037
No.

17:26.117 --> 17:27.178
Although those are cool, too.

17:27.238 --> 17:28.539
Those are cool, too.

17:28.679 --> 17:29.800
BAU BAU!

17:34.464 --> 17:36.646
A lot of listening to music.

17:36.806 --> 17:37.707
A lot of minutes.

17:37.787 --> 17:39.508
A lot of FUWAMOCO.

17:53.081 --> 17:54.041
But!

17:54.262 --> 17:59.485
Actually, we woke up to an amazing present today!

17:59.765 --> 18:07.651
A well-known animator and hololive fan, 2Snacks, released a really cute animation today!

18:08.411 --> 18:09.011
Of us!

18:09.672 --> 18:11.993
It's really cute, it's really silly.

18:12.574 --> 18:13.555
It's amazing!

18:14.275 --> 18:20.519
I really love the fluid motion of everything and how the world within Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion was captured.

18:20.539 --> 18:21.460
We laughed a lot watching it.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.821
Yeah!

18:22.881 --> 18:25.865
How dare you making us laugh straight from when we wake up, huh?

18:25.885 --> 18:26.065
Right!

18:26.145 --> 18:26.706
How dare you!

18:26.806 --> 18:29.709
Oh my gosh, I was not- I was not ready for that, no.

18:29.730 --> 18:30.410
I wasn't ready.

18:30.551 --> 18:36.898
No, but Atsushi-sensei has done a lot of animations that we've seen of our senpai before, so we-

18:37.999 --> 18:38.800
Do you understand?

18:38.820 --> 18:40.481
Do you understand, Ruffians?

18:40.501 --> 18:41.802
Do you understand what I'm feeling?

19:01.816 --> 19:03.217
Yeah, it's hard to put into words.

19:03.678 --> 19:10.824
But, you know, with this most recent one, even though it was really only just a few months ago that we made a debut.

19:10.864 --> 19:11.785
Right, right.

19:12.045 --> 19:15.609
But it takes us back, you know, to when we had just debuted.

19:15.669 --> 19:16.209
Right!

19:16.329 --> 19:21.554
And we're still just getting to know you, Ruffians, and it makes us feel really warm and fuzzy, too.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.555
Yeah, go check it out!

19:24.036 --> 19:24.437
Okay!

19:24.717 --> 19:25.738
Yeah, go check it out!

19:28.387 --> 19:33.151
Thank you so much for the precious challenges!

19:43.231 --> 19:46.353
We're sure she's going to love it too!

19:46.373 --> 19:49.054
She'll think it's funny if you laugh too, right?

19:49.094 --> 19:53.797
She'll be like, what's FUWAMOCO up to now?

19:53.837 --> 19:54.137
BAU BAU!

19:54.177 --> 19:57.579
Please tell us your reaction.

19:57.659 --> 19:57.819
Okay.

19:57.839 --> 20:04.603
Okay, I'm probably going to be like, that's so silly, but... I don't know.

20:05.124 --> 20:07.205
It has been a little while, right?

20:11.941 --> 20:14.222
There's a lot of milestones going on.

20:14.402 --> 20:17.243
But there was another milestone that we hit.

20:17.903 --> 20:21.084
And we didn't even realize it.

20:21.124 --> 20:21.544
Not at all.

20:25.112 --> 20:25.712
Ah, well.

20:26.933 --> 20:32.756
You know, there's one Ruffian- Actually, there's a couple Ruffians that are very strong at this.

20:33.977 --> 20:42.361
One Ruffian in particular is very strong at counting, has been counting every time we say BAU BAU since our debut.

20:43.581 --> 20:44.902
Every BAU BAU!

20:46.103 --> 20:47.263
What do you think of that, Ruffian?

20:47.283 --> 20:47.943
That's a lot of words.

20:48.204 --> 20:49.744
That's a lot, right?

20:50.245 --> 20:52.686
But they've been hitting a counter every time!

20:54.480 --> 20:54.600
Yeah.

20:54.640 --> 20:54.821
Yeah.

20:54.861 --> 20:55.001
But!

21:08.956 --> 21:12.639
Together we just broke 100,000 BAU BAUS!

21:12.979 --> 21:15.842
That's a lot of BAU BAUS!

21:15.942 --> 21:20.326
Moco-chan, do you think you can get 100 BAU BAUS right now?

21:20.706 --> 21:36.059
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

21:38.038 --> 21:39.479
I had 61,555 BAU BAUs, Moco-chan!

21:53.912 --> 21:56.454
41301 BAU BAUs.

21:56.554 --> 22:02.939
The bigger sister with the bigger BAU BAUs.

22:02.959 --> 22:09.044
I wonder how much time that we've spent just BAU BAUing alone though.

22:09.825 --> 22:10.425
Makes you think.

22:11.306 --> 22:12.887
That would surely be BAU time though.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.390
Thank you so much for calculating with me!

22:35.399 --> 22:37.080
Maybe you don't need to count anymore.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.442
Unless that's fun for you.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.764
Unless it's fun, you know.

22:41.864 --> 22:44.746
Everyone has their own idea of what's fun, you know.

22:44.766 --> 22:48.529
It's kind of different maybe from each Ruffian to each Ruffian.

22:48.629 --> 22:54.634
So, you know, we're really glad that you found yours and that we can protect your smile this way too.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.235
Yeah!

22:55.295 --> 22:56.255
You keep counting!

22:56.495 --> 22:58.657
If that's fun for you.

23:00.396 --> 23:02.458
BAU BAU!

23:02.498 --> 23:03.459
Thank you!

23:03.899 --> 23:06.862
Maybe one day I'll become good at counting too.

23:07.423 --> 23:08.163
I think it's gone.

23:08.183 --> 23:11.106
Since it's over 20, it's whiskey.

23:12.007 --> 23:12.487
It's what?

23:13.188 --> 23:13.808
Whiskey.

23:15.350 --> 23:15.710
Wow.

23:16.731 --> 23:19.153
It's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

23:19.894 --> 23:20.274
Yeah.

23:22.156 --> 23:24.799
Kind of on that note maybe.

23:25.970 --> 23:26.992
Kind of a misunderstanding.

23:27.092 --> 23:27.532
I don't know.

23:27.552 --> 23:28.213
Is it though?

23:28.253 --> 23:29.055
I don't know.

23:29.075 --> 23:29.616
Just a bit.

23:41.101 --> 23:41.601
Right?

23:41.661 --> 23:46.463
And we've told you before that it's our dog accents kind of coming through sometimes.

23:47.003 --> 23:53.165
But we've been seeing more and more comments saying, you know, oh, it's not that.

23:53.245 --> 23:54.865
It's not a dog accent.

23:54.905 --> 23:55.205
Why?

23:55.365 --> 23:56.746
It's what we said!

23:56.766 --> 23:57.726
It's not.

23:57.766 --> 24:04.948
You know that it's a Russian accent, or Italian accent, or Canadian accent, or British accent, or French accent.

24:05.548 --> 24:07.209
Or, uh, we've even heard that

24:07.869 --> 24:09.571
Ooh accent!

24:09.911 --> 24:12.493
We weren't so sure about the last one though.

24:12.714 --> 24:14.976
So like, we obviously heard like, French.

24:15.216 --> 24:15.816
Yeah, yeah.

24:16.077 --> 24:16.317
Right?

24:16.397 --> 24:19.460
But ooh, I don't know where that one comes from.

24:19.500 --> 24:26.706
But we searched it up, and we found out that Kobo-senpai sometimes likes to put on like a ooh accent for fun.

24:27.187 --> 24:27.527
Right?

24:27.707 --> 24:27.947
Yeah.

24:28.208 --> 24:28.468
Right.

24:28.628 --> 24:29.689
I don't know what it- what it-

24:31.961 --> 24:32.601
Is it fun?

24:33.002 --> 24:34.842
Kobo-senpai, is it fun?

24:36.463 --> 24:38.964
It's very cute though, but no!

24:39.244 --> 24:40.084
It's not that.

24:40.425 --> 24:41.445
It's just us.

24:42.065 --> 24:43.226
It's just how we are.

24:43.246 --> 24:47.127
You know, sometimes we say funny things or make mistakes.

24:47.648 --> 24:49.108
Mistakes.

24:49.268 --> 24:50.709
We don't really think of it like that.

24:50.769 --> 24:52.570
It's not really a mistake.

24:52.690 --> 24:54.410
It's just us being who we are.

24:56.305 --> 24:57.586
FUWAMOCO Morning!

24:57.606 --> 24:58.887
FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:07.006 --> 25:07.947
I don't know.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.969
Ruffians, you say the Ruffians.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.351
But, you know, I don't know.

25:13.371 --> 25:18.935
I think maybe it happens when I'm feeling more comfy and relaxed, you know?

25:19.175 --> 25:21.597
So, right now I'm not relaxed!

25:22.158 --> 25:24.520
Because Ruffians are Ruffians!

25:27.382 --> 25:27.682
Right.

25:27.942 --> 25:33.687
But Moco-chan, sometimes you, like, unnecessarily, like, sound to the end.

25:33.707 --> 25:34.647
Why do you mean?

25:34.687 --> 25:35.688
That sounds weird.

25:36.229 --> 25:36.789
I don't, I don't,

25:37.338 --> 25:40.539
I don't think I really feel it.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.700
I don't really know what this is.

25:44.060 --> 25:50.062
So I don't think it's really there, but... I feel like you're just being silly, huh, Ruffians?

25:50.302 --> 25:51.603
But, regardless!

25:52.143 --> 25:53.904
This is just how we are, okay?

25:54.064 --> 25:54.784
So Ruffians!

25:55.724 --> 26:03.047
Whether you say things a bit differently than others, or have an accent, we want you to embrace that, okay?

26:03.107 --> 26:04.427
It's what makes you, you!

26:04.807 --> 26:05.848
And it's beautiful!

26:07.308 --> 26:08.650
Don't be shy about it.

26:09.111 --> 26:10.373
And we won't be either, okay?

26:10.693 --> 26:13.297
Got it!

26:13.617 --> 26:14.699
Misunderstanding done.

26:14.719 --> 26:15.380
BAU BAU!

26:25.171 --> 26:26.151
No more questions.

26:26.511 --> 26:27.651
No more questions.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.691
We aren't taking any more questions.

26:30.392 --> 26:33.012
But, well, that's a lie.

26:33.352 --> 26:35.933
We still are taking questions, right, Moco-chan?

26:35.973 --> 26:36.233
We are.

26:36.273 --> 26:36.673
Yeah, it's okay.

26:37.093 --> 26:37.553
Yeah.

26:38.853 --> 26:40.053
Wow!

26:40.953 --> 26:41.794
Ruffians!

26:42.594 --> 26:45.874
It's the beginning of a new, new, beautiful, brand new week.

26:46.615 --> 26:48.495
And with the start of every week,

26:49.784 --> 26:52.025
It's time to challenge ourselves to something new.

26:53.065 --> 27:03.549
I would say that Moco-chan, you're going to be challenging yourself to something new, but it's not really new at this point anymore, huh?

27:03.889 --> 27:07.911
But Moco-chan wants to overcome her fear.

27:08.351 --> 27:09.972
It's not a fear of natto.

27:12.092 --> 27:14.113
You know, natto is really good for you.

27:14.193 --> 27:15.194
It's really healthy.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.974
It's worthwhile doing this.

27:17.135 --> 27:22.817
I feel like it's supposed to be healthy, but now I feel like the stress is maybe not healthy anymore.

27:23.197 --> 27:26.699
Well, today we're going to continue the challenge.

27:27.159 --> 27:30.680
So, Ruffians, there might be some Ruffians that still don't know what natto is.

27:30.740 --> 27:31.641
That is okay.

27:32.321 --> 27:33.321
You get to learn natto!

27:33.341 --> 27:37.603
I wonder how many Ruffians learn what natto is through this challenge.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.604
That would be interesting to find out.

27:39.684 --> 27:43.566
But natto is a fermented soybean.

27:43.926 --> 27:46.447
And it's really popular as a Japanese breakfast food.

27:46.807 --> 27:53.830
But it can be rather sticky and slimy and a bit strong smelling.

27:53.850 --> 27:54.810
Difficult.

27:55.371 --> 27:55.791
Yeah.

27:56.431 --> 28:04.473
to eat, but it is really really healthy for you and I want Moco-chan to be able to do BAU BAU for a long time.

28:04.493 --> 28:07.214
That's a good!

28:07.794 --> 28:14.215
So that's why you're gonna challenge yourself and eat tomato today, right?

28:14.235 --> 28:16.396
But Moco-chan, how are you feeling today though?

28:16.863 --> 28:17.684
As I stir it up.

28:17.844 --> 28:18.104
Not.

28:18.504 --> 28:18.764
Not.

28:19.825 --> 28:21.526
Not into challenging myself.

28:22.087 --> 28:22.407
Why?

28:22.427 --> 28:24.468
It's a new week, Moco-chan.

28:24.488 --> 28:26.990
Yeah, but- You could've set a good example for the Ruffians.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.411
I don't know.

28:29.412 --> 28:33.234
Maybe it's just me, but I want to choose when I challenge it.

28:33.995 --> 28:35.276
And I don't feel like it now.

28:35.456 --> 28:36.176
I never feel like it.

28:36.196 --> 28:37.197
One day's the day.

28:37.497 --> 28:38.298
It's a new week.

28:38.938 --> 28:39.418
Not all Fridays.

28:39.438 --> 28:46.083
I feel like if I use my brain, it's just an excuse, because you know, when a challenge comes your way, you can't be like, oh, I'm not ready for it.

28:47.278 --> 28:50.044
Waffle, it's ready for Moco-chan!

28:50.445 --> 28:51.667
Wait, I don't have a tissue.

28:51.687 --> 28:52.589
Oh no.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.153
I don't have tea!

28:55.034 --> 28:55.475
Oh no.

28:57.093 --> 28:59.275
But Moco-chan, I did do something nice.

28:59.675 --> 29:00.796
I brought you soy sauce.

29:00.816 --> 29:03.397
Do you want some soy sauce on it?

29:04.838 --> 29:07.260
Can I pour soy sauce on the one bean?

29:07.820 --> 29:08.080
No!

29:08.480 --> 29:09.781
It's gonna get everywhere.

29:10.342 --> 29:12.983
The poi soy sauce is not- Poi?

29:13.123 --> 29:14.624
It's not gonna go on at all.

29:14.644 --> 29:15.305
The poi!

29:15.705 --> 29:18.747
I'm gonna put the soy sauce all over it, okay?

29:19.668 --> 29:22.389
Okay.

29:22.409 --> 29:23.010
Not too much.

29:23.370 --> 29:23.950
There you go!

29:23.970 --> 29:24.811
That's a good amount.

29:25.922 --> 29:28.584
I'm gonna stir it a bit more.

29:28.644 --> 29:31.386
The flavor is gonna be really strong.

29:31.406 --> 29:33.027
You don't need to work that hard for it.

29:33.047 --> 29:36.089
The soy sauce is becoming friends with the soybeans.

29:36.730 --> 29:38.251
They're soy happy!

29:38.311 --> 29:38.731
Whoa!

29:38.791 --> 29:41.393
It got really... What's wrong?

29:41.513 --> 29:42.934
Why are you screaming?

29:43.414 --> 29:45.096
It got really strong smelling all of a sudden.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.558
Because you screamed, the Ruffians didn't hear it when I said they're soy happy.

29:53.702 --> 29:54.662
This looks good!

29:55.905 --> 29:57.787
The stings are extra stingy today.

29:58.307 --> 29:59.047
Oh, that's worse.

29:59.648 --> 30:00.328
No, it's good!

30:00.629 --> 30:01.269
It's worse.

30:01.389 --> 30:01.850
It's good.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.552
Okay, Moco-chan!

30:05.272 --> 30:05.913
I'm hungry.

30:05.933 --> 30:07.614
At least I have my chopsticks.

30:07.634 --> 30:08.675
I'm hungry.

30:08.695 --> 30:10.556
It looks really good.

30:10.616 --> 30:12.098
It smells really good.

30:12.138 --> 30:12.598
Hello!

30:12.618 --> 30:14.199
Moco-chan is going to eat natto!

30:14.259 --> 30:14.299
In 3, 2, 1...

30:18.720 --> 30:20.781
That's right, we can't count down yet!

30:21.382 --> 30:27.806
Moco-chan, first, before you eat it, you have to say thank you to the farmers in Kochi.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.928
They worked hard.

30:30.708 --> 30:32.429
I don't know if that has much feeling in it.

30:32.449 --> 30:35.452
You're just mumbling it.

30:36.272 --> 30:40.415
Okay, Moco-chan, you're just gonna start with one bean, but after that you're gonna eat another one.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.070
It looks really good.

30:47.090 --> 30:50.031
The color is a bit darker this time because of the soy sauce.

30:50.692 --> 30:51.932
They're extra shiny.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.833
Not so fluffy, but shiny.

30:55.033 --> 30:58.655
It's like natto performing on stage, you know?

30:58.735 --> 30:59.735
It's doing its best.

30:59.795 --> 31:02.036
This is the moment where it's going to shine the most.

31:02.516 --> 31:03.777
Be the brightest, you know?

31:04.949 --> 31:06.512
You can see it's working so hard.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.317
The farmers worked so hard to produce them.

31:09.337 --> 31:10.459
Super silly.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.221
I know.

31:11.962 --> 31:12.864
Now it's ready.

31:13.004 --> 31:14.226
It's that moment.

31:15.028 --> 31:15.369
Right.

31:16.274 --> 31:17.055
They're shining.

31:17.515 --> 31:21.238
I want to be able to eat it so that I can enjoy it, you know?

31:21.298 --> 31:24.241
Because I don't want to just be like, ah, I'm overdoing it.

31:24.301 --> 31:27.564
I don't want to just be pushing myself really hard to be able to eat it.

31:27.604 --> 31:29.145
I want to be able to eat it and enjoy it.

31:29.165 --> 31:31.767
No, but I want to be able to enjoy it.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.490
Be like, ah, I'm woken up, I want to eat.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.753
I actually really do thank the farmers in Tochigi.

31:37.773 --> 31:40.095
That's how I want to feel.

31:41.579 --> 31:44.980
Okay, Moco-chan, you're gonna have to eat it because I'm really hungry.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.201
Let's finish up, Moco-chan.

31:48.341 --> 31:52.023
I'm hungry, but I don't want to eat this!

31:52.823 --> 31:54.744
It makes me feel the opposite of hungry.

31:55.644 --> 31:59.945
Okay, Moco-chan, we're gonna count down from five.

31:59.965 --> 32:01.366
Five!

32:02.006 --> 32:02.686
Four!

32:03.206 --> 32:04.087
Three!

32:04.107 --> 32:05.367
Two!

32:05.387 --> 32:05.447
One!

32:06.488 --> 32:09.569
It's in my mouth.

32:09.629 --> 32:10.169
It's on my tongue.

32:11.408 --> 32:14.370
She's kind of attempting at chewing, like she doesn't know how to chew.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.172
Oh, it's stuck to her tooth!

32:16.212 --> 32:20.055
What are you gonna do, Moco-chan?

32:20.515 --> 32:24.419
Are you even trying to eat food?

32:24.439 --> 32:28.042
That's not how you eat food.

32:28.522 --> 32:29.883
Just did not eat it at all.

32:29.903 --> 32:31.925
That was barely in there.

32:32.565 --> 32:33.926
That was barely in there.

32:33.966 --> 32:35.988
Moco-chan, do you need me to be an example?

32:36.008 --> 32:36.048
No?

32:39.025 --> 32:39.766
Cough drop!

32:39.786 --> 32:46.111
I'm actually proud though, maybe you improved Moco-chan because you didn't ask for water.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.594
I just got a cough drop and it's more flavor.

32:48.614 --> 32:49.815
I wanna eat it.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.097
Ruffian natto is so yummy.

32:53.878 --> 32:56.120
The flavor is too strong, the natto.

32:57.602 --> 32:59.504
I feel like the soy sauce made it too strong.

33:00.004 --> 33:02.146
Is it okay if I eat it all right now?

33:02.166 --> 33:04.148
It improved the flavor in the wrong direction.

33:05.175 --> 33:06.376
It's so yummy!

33:07.237 --> 33:09.378
Moco-chan, watch me carefully, okay?

33:09.898 --> 33:11.779
I like eating aijiki beans.

33:11.799 --> 33:13.781
Moco-chan, are you watching?

33:13.881 --> 33:16.823
No, I don't care.

33:20.905 --> 33:21.986
Natto Masta.

33:22.006 --> 33:22.766
Mokugoe.

33:23.747 --> 33:24.407
Definitely.

33:24.427 --> 33:26.629
It's so yummy!

33:27.670 --> 33:29.831
Give me one moment, there's about two bites left.

33:34.673 --> 33:36.955
Is this what FUWAMOCO Morning has come down to?

33:36.995 --> 33:39.938
We're just gonna... eat.

33:41.419 --> 33:42.240
I'm hungry.

33:42.340 --> 33:43.862
We're just gonna eat now, hai.

33:43.882 --> 33:47.225
The farmers of Tochigi make too yummy natto.

33:47.765 --> 33:49.487
Oh, it's their fault, hai.

33:49.607 --> 33:51.269
We're gonna blame it on them now.

33:52.950 --> 33:54.312
Fuwawa is gaming.

33:54.412 --> 33:55.453
No, she's eating.

33:55.473 --> 33:58.195
Moco-chan, you're watching?

33:58.576 --> 33:58.696
No.

34:02.075 --> 34:03.036
So, so strong.

34:07.461 --> 34:07.941
You done?

34:09.723 --> 34:10.144
You good?

34:11.605 --> 34:12.106
You good?

34:12.126 --> 34:15.690
You good?

34:15.730 --> 34:19.394
ASMR, please don't listen to Fuwawa chewing!

34:19.414 --> 34:19.454
No.

34:20.911 --> 34:22.712
Only listen to it.

34:23.292 --> 34:23.592
I'm done!

34:23.652 --> 34:26.074
Gochisousama deshita!

34:26.834 --> 34:27.935
It was so yummy!

34:28.335 --> 34:32.157
Moco-chan, you have to chew slowly so you can taste them.

34:32.177 --> 34:34.018
I don't want to taste it.

34:34.038 --> 34:34.938
Avoid my tears.

34:37.419 --> 34:38.560
Good job, Fuwawa!

34:39.080 --> 34:41.001
Thank you, you didn't need to say so much.

34:42.022 --> 34:43.622
What about thank you, Mococo?

34:43.642 --> 34:43.822
Well...

34:45.419 --> 34:54.023
I feel like... I have the strength to give you one more minute.

34:54.363 --> 34:55.924
But Moco-chan, I don't know.

34:56.004 --> 35:00.246
I feel like at the end of every challenge I want to compliment you.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.427
You shouldn't compliment me.

35:02.867 --> 35:03.907
You tried, Mococo.

35:03.967 --> 35:04.507
Thank you.

35:04.968 --> 35:06.368
What's important is that I tried.

35:06.468 --> 35:07.729
I didn't want to, but I did.

35:07.749 --> 35:10.050
It didn't go well, but I tried, okay?

35:11.445 --> 35:12.586
So that deserves praise.

35:13.167 --> 35:13.487
Right.

35:13.807 --> 35:14.588
That was an attempt.

35:14.628 --> 35:15.209
That's good.

35:15.269 --> 35:18.111
You know, you didn't feel like it, but you overcame those feelings.

35:18.131 --> 35:19.713
I tried it.

35:19.753 --> 35:20.554
I guess that's good.

35:20.634 --> 35:21.715
Good job, Moco-chan.

35:21.755 --> 35:25.238
BAU BAU!

35:25.679 --> 35:32.165
Now, for our Doggie of the Day, we have... De-den!

35:32.225 --> 35:34.387
The Doggie of the Day is a teen!

35:36.209 --> 35:47.388
Moco-chan, do you ever feel so defeated in Donkey Kong Country that maybe you feel like giving a little lick to the controller too?

35:49.291 --> 35:49.672
Maybe.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.221
I feel a lot of stuff, huh?

35:55.363 --> 35:56.904
I don't want to lick the controller.

35:57.264 --> 35:57.704
Why?

35:58.625 --> 36:01.127
Because your hands have been on it.

36:01.147 --> 36:02.108
Just the top part.

36:02.668 --> 36:03.369
The top part?

36:03.389 --> 36:04.109
The top part.

36:04.149 --> 36:06.111
Well, you licked the Switch cartridge, right?

36:06.171 --> 36:07.572
So... I didn't do that.

36:07.792 --> 36:08.332
You did.

36:08.372 --> 36:11.234
We should try licking all the hardware.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.275
Gaming hardware.

36:12.896 --> 36:13.476
Maybe not.

36:13.916 --> 36:14.437
Maybe not.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.438
Especially not after eating natto, no.

36:16.879 --> 36:17.119
No?

36:17.139 --> 36:17.599
Yeah.

36:19.560 --> 36:19.620
Wow.

36:19.940 --> 36:27.182
You know, Athena might like giving a lick to the controller sometimes too, but she also really likes naps and hikes.

36:27.362 --> 36:28.383
Very healthy.

36:28.643 --> 36:30.203
I like licking the controller.

36:30.803 --> 36:31.964
It's a very healthy combo.

36:31.984 --> 36:34.404
Very big sub for licking the controller, right?

36:34.964 --> 36:41.646
FUWAMOCO, we haven't really gone on many hikes before, but we also, we like, instead of naps, we like big sleeps.

36:41.726 --> 36:42.687
Big naps!

36:42.807 --> 36:45.247
And we like long walks.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.088
So it's kind of similar, right?

36:48.248 --> 36:50.129
Athena also likes broccoli.

36:50.570 --> 36:51.410
Broccoli is good.

36:51.490 --> 36:52.571
That's a good choice, right?

36:52.611 --> 36:53.592
Broccoli is yummy.

36:53.792 --> 36:56.994
I feel like we could be good friends together, you know?

36:57.514 --> 37:00.536
But broccoli is the best when it's not raw.

37:00.556 --> 37:01.417
Raw-ish.

37:01.437 --> 37:02.717
What do you think, Ruffians?

37:02.818 --> 37:03.558
Raw-ish.

37:04.579 --> 37:05.819
That's kind of weird.

37:06.300 --> 37:06.680
What?

37:07.300 --> 37:09.662
Licking broccoli is weird, Ruffians.

37:10.803 --> 37:11.063
What?

37:13.939 --> 37:14.279
It's yum.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.041
Vegetables yum.

37:30.473 --> 37:30.653
BAU!

37:30.693 --> 37:30.874
BAU!

37:31.114 --> 37:31.474
BAU!

37:31.554 --> 37:31.754
BAU!

37:31.855 --> 37:32.315
BAU!

37:32.335 --> 37:32.575
BAU!

37:54.062 --> 37:54.342
BAU BAU!

38:16.818 --> 38:18.178
Hi, Ruffians!

38:18.298 --> 38:21.119
I think you've been going on lots of walks, right?

38:21.419 --> 38:22.659
Thank you!

38:22.679 --> 38:25.500
Thank you for stretching those paws.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.241
Getting out there even though it's a bit cold.

38:29.821 --> 38:33.342
Well, Ruffians, where were we out and about this time?

38:35.162 --> 38:38.903
Ni hao, de-den!

38:40.203 --> 38:43.844
Is this the gate to the Northwest Passage?

38:45.925 --> 38:51.236
I mean, it sure looks like it could be it, but... Sorry, it's not.

38:53.885 --> 39:04.430
The way that we can tell this isn't actually it though, because the only way you can actually get to the Northwest Passage is you have to enter in first from the Maka.

39:04.590 --> 39:04.950
Yeah.

39:05.311 --> 39:09.493
Yeah, you can't go human world to Northwest Passage.

39:09.553 --> 39:11.153
It's not p-p-possible.

39:11.233 --> 39:13.475
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-possible.

39:14.035 --> 39:15.536
Yeah, it's pretty tricky.

39:15.556 --> 39:16.756
Travel's a little takes a while.

39:16.816 --> 39:18.557
It takes a little bit, you know.

39:18.877 --> 39:20.418
It makes travel a bit of a headache.

39:20.987 --> 39:24.210
So, first you'll need to find your way to the Makai, okay?

39:24.450 --> 39:29.535
And then from there, you have to make sure to take the right gate to the Northwest Passage, okay?

39:30.576 --> 39:36.622
It's not as obvious as this, and you know there isn't text on it, but we can tell you one thing!

39:37.441 --> 39:39.403
It's definitely more impressive than that.

39:39.423 --> 39:41.404
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

39:41.464 --> 39:42.165
It's pretty cool.

39:42.225 --> 39:42.665
Yeah.

39:42.725 --> 39:44.447
Not obvious, but more impressive.

39:44.487 --> 39:47.729
You'll know it from the feeling it makes you feel when you look at it.

39:47.769 --> 39:48.009
Yeah.

39:48.390 --> 39:49.090
Yeah.

39:49.311 --> 39:53.194
But, uh, well... Good luck on your search for the... Yeah!

39:53.354 --> 39:55.115
...the gate to the Northwest Passage.

39:55.576 --> 39:56.937
But, uh... Praise Makai.

39:57.097 --> 40:00.479
Yeah, I've had a feeling you might be walking for quite a while.

40:00.499 --> 40:00.900
Yeah.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.407
BAU BAU!

40:04.427 --> 40:06.850
That'll be good for a couple walks though, huh?

40:06.910 --> 40:08.211
More than a couple, I think.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.533
Maybe a lifetime of walks.

40:09.553 --> 40:10.414
More than a lifetime.

40:11.555 --> 40:16.041
And for our question of the day, we have... We're still taking questions.

40:16.081 --> 40:16.621
We have... De-den!

40:20.726 --> 40:23.349
Hello FUWAMOCO!

40:23.389 --> 40:24.230
BAU BAU!

40:24.270 --> 40:32.398
So I recently saw you both at Anime NYC, the Q&A, but I got scared to ask a question because of stage fright.

40:32.418 --> 40:34.540
Don't worry, don't worry.

40:34.620 --> 40:37.924
So my question is, how do you deal with public speaking?

40:38.584 --> 40:38.964
Good question.

40:38.984 --> 40:40.926
This is a very good question, yeah.

40:41.086 --> 40:48.770
I feel like, you know, the number one way to help with that kind of shaky feeling that you get before you're going to go in front of a large audience.

40:48.850 --> 40:49.791
Or your tummy hurts.

40:49.931 --> 40:52.092
The number one way is practice.

40:52.112 --> 40:53.393
Probably practice, you know?

40:53.473 --> 40:57.876
Having a clear image of what you want to do or what you want to say helps a lot, I know.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.098
But we very much understand.

41:01.938 --> 41:04.120
I think if it was us in your position,

41:08.945 --> 41:09.986
It's very nerve-wracking.

41:10.006 --> 41:10.967
Right, right.

41:11.007 --> 41:12.448
And then like, this is the what-ifs.

41:12.488 --> 41:15.009
Like, what if the microphone doesn't work?

41:15.170 --> 41:17.231
Or, you know, those kind of things.

41:17.291 --> 41:20.233
That makes it very, very scary.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.595
But please don't worry though.

41:22.835 --> 41:25.657
We're very, very happy to answer your questions.

41:25.697 --> 41:27.658
I wish we could answer more questions.

41:28.539 --> 41:38.768
You know, if somehow, somehow, you kinda get all tongue-tied like FUWAMOCO does and it kinda gets jumbled all up, don't worry because we'll help you.

41:39.468 --> 41:41.730
We've been there too, so.

41:41.810 --> 41:43.132
I think though, if...

41:44.096 --> 41:54.022
Something happens and you just have to remember that even if things end up like the worst case scenario for you, in the end, it doesn't really matter too much, okay?

41:54.642 --> 41:58.964
Everyone will forget and maybe they won't even notice.

42:00.669 --> 42:02.170
Just take it in stride, okay?

42:02.510 --> 42:06.933
Because you have a long life with lots of successes and lots of failures.

42:07.013 --> 42:09.694
So just take it easy, okay?

42:10.815 --> 42:11.395
Exactly.

42:11.775 --> 42:13.456
BAU BAU!

42:14.877 --> 42:21.841
If anything, I want to talk more, so don't feel too nervous to talk because that makes me sad.

42:22.421 --> 42:27.404
Don't say it's my dog when it's not your dog.

42:27.444 --> 42:28.244
Be truthful.

42:51.696 --> 42:53.057
And questions too!

42:53.377 --> 42:54.417
And Pero Sightings.

42:55.438 --> 42:57.158
Please let us know with the hashtag!

42:57.458 --> 42:58.299
Hashtag!

42:58.839 --> 43:00.820
FWMCMORNING!

43:00.840 --> 43:02.700
BAU BAU!

43:03.241 --> 43:04.961
And for our next stream!

43:05.001 --> 43:07.702
We have another stream today!

43:07.742 --> 43:08.963
We have de-den!

43:09.603 --> 43:11.625
Holosuika!

43:11.705 --> 43:13.627
We're going to be playing Holosuika.

43:13.727 --> 43:15.508
You might have heard.

43:15.568 --> 43:18.031
There was a big update.

43:18.251 --> 43:24.196
And now, not only are Ien-senpai and ID-senpai included, but FUWAMOCO!

43:24.476 --> 43:25.397
We're there too!

43:25.437 --> 43:26.338
We're in it!

43:26.578 --> 43:28.540
So we're going to be making a lot of

43:28.880 --> 43:31.801
Small Moco-chan and big Fuwawas.

43:32.202 --> 43:35.123
I want to try a whole bunch of different play styles.

43:35.403 --> 43:40.686
Last time I tried to get a top score, but I kind of have an idea for something else too, so we'll have to see.

43:40.706 --> 43:42.427
Please join us, Ruffians.

43:42.467 --> 43:48.249
You can play along too because you can play right now on a web browser or browser phone.

43:48.310 --> 43:50.611
It's really fun, so please check it out.

43:51.531 --> 43:52.833
BAU BAU!

43:52.933 --> 43:54.194
And our schedule!

43:54.214 --> 43:56.136
We have a brand new schedule!

43:56.556 --> 44:07.228
Not only is FUWAMOCO Morning episode 50 this week, the very next episode, but we're gonna be doing our best to finish off Metal Gear Solid and...

44:07.788 --> 44:09.470
Donkey Kong Country.

44:09.630 --> 44:10.130
I don't know.

44:10.410 --> 44:15.995
Ruffians, you keep on saying it's going to be tricky for us, but we're already on disc two of Metal Gear Solid.

44:16.355 --> 44:17.536
So I'm pretty confident.

44:17.556 --> 44:18.977
And then Donkey Kong Country.

44:19.457 --> 44:19.938
I don't know.

44:20.018 --> 44:23.801
I think we only have a couple stages left, you know?

44:23.841 --> 44:26.763
So why are you saying it's going to be final part one?

44:27.324 --> 44:27.664
Why?

44:28.024 --> 44:28.325
Why?

44:28.505 --> 44:28.885
Why?

44:32.308 --> 44:33.669
The boss is going to be tricky.

44:33.729 --> 44:36.231
Well, we've never played against the boss.

44:38.466 --> 44:39.487
Two discs for one game?

44:39.507 --> 44:40.027
Yeah!

44:40.067 --> 44:40.667
Yeah!

44:40.927 --> 44:44.948
We'll play the PlayStation 1, so... They're like that sometimes.

44:45.288 --> 44:53.390
But we hope you'll join us as we finish Metal Gear Solid and Donkey Kong Country, which was a game we started at debut, kind of like.

44:53.610 --> 44:53.870
Yeah!

44:53.930 --> 44:55.211
We'll be very happy.

44:56.791 --> 45:06.454
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for tweeting us today for FUWAMOCO Morning, our last episode before we go to our 50th episode.

45:06.974 --> 45:10.415

45:10.715 --> 45:12.756

45:13.356 --> 45:17.898
