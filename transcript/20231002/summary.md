## Introduction (5:00)

## Pero Sighting (6:36)

[Itta](https://twitter.com/Itta12065/status/1707447872021790981) found Pero at their local cat cafe trying to blend with the other felines. While Ruffians want Pero kicked out, FUWAMOCO intervene by saying that he doesn't deserve that.

## New Month, New Hope (9:25)

FUWAMOCO encourage us to reflect on the last month, and to work hard next one!

## Celebration: 100 videos (12:13)

FUWAMOCO has reached over 100 videos (including membership exclusives) published on their YouTube channel!

## Tofu Day (14:46)

Apparently unbeknownst to most Ruffians, today is Tofu Day! This comes from a Japanese word play, as today is the 10th month (with 10 read as 'tou' in Japanese) and the 2nd day (2 read as 'fu'). FUWAMOCO express their appreciation for tofu and all things soy.

## Misunderstanding (19:32)

[Last FWMC Morning](https://youtu.be/A844xQnE97A) had no Misunderstanding corner. FUWAMOCO apologize for creating a misunderstanding that there were no misunderstandings to announce that day; they just forgot.

## Today's Challenge (21:46)

In line with Tofu Day celebrations, Mococo gives natto another go, again with no soy sauce. After stalling for almost 10 minutes, [the beans were in](https://youtu.be/PkKdHUz89jY?t=1870)!

## Doggie of the Day (32:55)

[Max Power](https://twitter.com/MaxPowe65865644/status/1707163920425705773) shows us a picture of Skye "enjoying" their dog. It seems that their reaction is the same as Mococo after eating natto...

## Today I Went On A Walk (34:54)

[otm](https://twitter.com/otm_ch_/status/1707413401948114989) just came back from a trip to Japan and shares with us a picturesque and quite romantic photo of Manseibashi bridge near Akihabara, which is otherwise known as the mecca of Otaku culture.

## Question Of The Day (36:04)

[Million OSS](https://twitter.com/MillionOss/status/1707624052406546845) wonders if FUWAMOCO have ever fought for the controller? They say that they are pretty used to sharing, and while sometimes it's not easy to let go of the controller and share it, it's also not a big deal.
