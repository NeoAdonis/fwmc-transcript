00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:32.927
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.926
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:37.830
BAU BAU BAU!

00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:43.834
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:46.738
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.941
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.864
BAU BAU!

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:59.372
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:00.453
BAU BAU!

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:01.074
Are you awake?

00:05:01.094 --> 00:05:02.636
I feel like we're extra loud today, huh?

00:05:03.077 --> 00:05:03.497
Maybe.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:15.018
Ruffians, thank you for joining us today for our 156th episode!

00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:15.920
Thank you!

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.663
And it's a brand new week too!

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.086
Yes, brand new week!

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:21.250
Your week, your hour is having a week.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:33.813
It's time to wake up!

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:43.390
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.111
It's Monday.

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:45.494
It's Monday!

00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:48.619
And that means it's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:48.739
Yeah!

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.026
But if you still love FUWAMOCO Morning, you're new!

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:53.146
Yeah.

00:05:53.988 --> 00:06:03.023
Well, if you're joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday today.

00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:05.147
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:07.791
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:13.620
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.886
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:17.987
Hashtag.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.431
FWMCMORNING!

00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:24.998
Let's go BAU BAU to brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:26.701
BAU BAU!

00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.028
Oh no, that's a bad sign Moco-chan.

00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:36.393
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:36.593
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:37.054
That was sudden.

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:37.814
That surprised me.

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:40.837
What was that?

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.459
What was that?

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.482
We're gonna start the week off on the right paw!

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:48.485
Say it with me!

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:48.685
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:48.765
Hi.

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:49.145
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:52.048
No bad things happening this week.

00:06:52.268 --> 00:06:55.591
It's gonna be an even funner week than the weekend last week.

00:06:57.213 --> 00:06:58.154
I forgot.

00:06:58.174 --> 00:07:00.576
I was so surprised I forgot.

00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:12.207
There's been another Pero sighting!

00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:13.469
Really?

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:16.032
Really?

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:19.457
Okay, well, this is for your sakes, okay?

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:19.818
Safety.

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:22.462
Let's take a look at what Pero was sighted.

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:22.582
Okay.

00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:26.347
De-den!

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.150
Hi!

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:29.639
What the heck?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.246
The Pero turned into a bottle of salad dressing.

00:07:34.706 --> 00:07:35.627
Salad dressing?

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.370
Huh?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.354
Wait, but... It's not popcorn.

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:41.035
That's not salad.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:43.198
Popcorn is not salad.

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:44.159
I don't know.

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:48.225
I don't think you should be tempted to put the Pero dressing on your popcorn.

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:48.565
No.

00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:53.392
Yeah, but you know it's a very fancy packaging.

00:07:53.412 --> 00:07:55.055
Yeah, you know.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.837
Pero does sort of a convincing job.

00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.142
No, I still think you don't.

00:08:00.162 --> 00:08:02.189
Popcorn is best consumed as it is.

00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.936
Without salad dressing.

00:08:03.956 --> 00:08:05.140
What about butter?

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.449
Without salad dressing.

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.969
Marjoram.

00:08:13.074 --> 00:08:17.020
Whatever the ruffians think is best, but not Pero salad dressing!

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.102
Salt is normal.

00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:19.865
Mayo, Pero, no!

00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:20.926
It's gonna be on.

00:08:21.046 --> 00:08:22.709
You have to put salt on popcorn.

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:24.732
I need to put sugar on it.

00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:25.053
What's that?

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:25.654
Put sugar on it.

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:31.483
Caramel, caramel, caramel works too.

00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:33.726
No, no, no, no, no.

00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:34.792
I don't know.

00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:36.615
I don't think you need this, alright?

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:42.025
In those situations, you know, you're like, ah, I don't need this, but I bought it from the grocery store.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.028
You return it, right?

00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:47.374
So maybe you should just return the Pero dress to the store.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:48.295
Yeah, before it goes bad.

00:08:48.516 --> 00:08:48.977
Right.

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:56.890
I'll get all moody and... sort of... fuzzy on the inside.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.992
Why do you know you drop it?

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.034
What's the options?

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:03.715
Options!

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:06.800
BAU BAU!

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.162
Be careful Ruffians!

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:09.705
Can you return salad dressing?

00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:11.728
Why would you not be able to?

00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:13.110
Especially when it's not.

00:09:15.313 --> 00:09:18.518
This salad dressing is not to my taste buds.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:23.085
Then you just wash it down the sink, right?

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:30.826
BAU BAU!

00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:47.470
BAU BAU!

00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:49.080
Wow!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.008
There was some very big news at hololive over the weekend!

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:58.996
Ai-senpai, Akirose-senpai, Aki Roseto!

00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:04.024
She reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:22.837
We just wanted to say a big congrats to our dear senpai.

00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.842
It was like so hard.

00:10:25.882 --> 00:10:29.208
You know, Akirose senpai is so amazing and sweet.

00:10:29.268 --> 00:10:31.772
We really love her singing and her atmosphere.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.876
Her original songs.

00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:36.141
Everything's so much.

00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:37.243
She's so talented.

00:10:37.424 --> 00:10:40.250
I don't know, just listen to her sing too.

00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:42.374
Her karaoke too.

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:42.976
Howl!

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:43.497
Howl!

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:47.145
Howl is... What about Heroine Audition?

00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:48.928
What about Rosie the Lamp?

00:10:48.969 --> 00:10:49.830
There's just so many.

00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:51.714
Every song is amazing.

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:52.977
Every song is different.

00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:53.839
It's perfect.

00:10:55.102 --> 00:11:11.396
Now everyone at hololive JP is over 1 million subscribers on YouTube too!

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:12.718
That's crazy!

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.562
1 million!

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:17.556
Big congrats to Akiro-sensei!

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.257
Bye!

00:11:18.498 --> 00:11:25.688
We're so happy to be able to talk with Rizzolino during Hanami, so... We got to ask her a bunch of questions, too.

00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:27.711
Yeah, all these questions!

00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:35.923
Yeah, but you know, we just can't wait to see even more great things happen in the future, so... Always amazing, exciting updates.

00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:38.527
Yeah.

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:39.148
Akiro-sensei, congratulations!

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.522
Yeah, big big news!

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:51.489
But on the hololive EN side, there's also something to look forward to today!

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:53.511
Very soon!

00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:53.731
Very soon!

00:11:53.751 --> 00:11:59.136
Wow, that is... De-den!

00:11:59.156 --> 00:12:01.258
Ina-senpai!

00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:02.399
She's revealing a new outfit today!

00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:02.800
Is it here?

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:11.228
Today at 6PM PT or in the morning in Japan at 10AM JST, she'll be sharing a brand new outfit with us!

00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:14.791
More announcements?

00:12:14.811 --> 00:12:15.492
What's more announcements?

00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:16.513
I'm excited!

00:12:16.533 --> 00:12:17.054
What could it be?

00:12:17.074 --> 00:12:18.556
It looks very cute!

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:18.816
Oh my god!

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.798
It's a side ponytail!

00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:21.760
Side ponytail probably!

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.400
Very refreshing!

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.903
You know, it looks very chill.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:26.625
What else?

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:29.569
What else are we thinking?

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:29.929
Casual look?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.551
Casual maybe?

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.252
I don't know.

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:36.557
Maybe it's like a school uniform.

00:12:36.577 --> 00:12:38.059
School uniform?

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:52.926
FUWAMOCO I'm imagining.

00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:56.573
Yara Ina-senpai!

00:12:56.953 --> 00:13:09.285
But again, it'll be happening at 6PM PT, so we hope that you'll check it out and see what Ina-senpai's new outfit looks like, as well as her new exciting announcements too!

00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:10.066
I'm really excited.

00:13:10.086 --> 00:13:10.426
Why?

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:11.948
What could it be?

00:13:11.968 --> 00:13:12.888
Leopard print!

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:14.550
We don't know!

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.973
Ina-senpai leopard print, I think that one could work well.

00:13:18.073 --> 00:13:20.316
Right now it's just purple and orange, we don't know.

00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:21.757
Purple and orange.

00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:24.820
Leopard print's kinda like orange, right?

00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:32.861
We'll have to see!

00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.305
We don't have long to wait!

00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:35.485
BAU BAU!

00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:38.871
I'm super excited now!

00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:40.735
Oh my gosh!

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:45.002
And Ina-senpai's outfit is always so super cute!

00:13:46.957 --> 00:14:00.435
We just finished the latest chapter of Enrico of ENigmatic Recollection.

00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:03.378
Chapter 2, Chains of Fate.

00:14:03.398 --> 00:14:09.526
In case you missed it, it sprawled over one week and all of us EN lovers participated.

00:14:09.987 --> 00:14:11.749
Crazy things happened, you know.

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:16.896
We were able to save the kingdom of Lobesto, but many things didn't quite work out.

00:14:16.876 --> 00:14:21.623
As we expected because there's a little bit of a cliffhanger at the end there.

00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:24.627
We've been seeing on Twitter there's been a bit of a uproar.

00:14:25.488 --> 00:14:26.330
Uproar?

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.473
A rebellion would you say?

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:29.714
A rebellion!

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:36.745
Wow at the very end of the season there is a wonderful animated short fully animated!

00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:39.408
Featuring all of us hololive EN members!

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:42.613
But surprisingly, Advent.

00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:44.400
What's wrong with Ambe?

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:47.083
Something's kind of funny.

00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:50.328
We're seeing some pretty evil things, you know?

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:53.092
I don't know.

00:14:53.132 --> 00:14:57.538
Somehow, I think some Adventrix follow listeners.

00:14:58.559 --> 00:14:59.901
What a surprise, huh?

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.603
It is surprising, huh?

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:07.251
You know, it's surprising what could be evil.

00:15:10.555 --> 00:15:12.058
We are innocent puppies, though.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.723
We are thrown in the sewer, but we're innocent, though.

00:15:14.743 --> 00:15:16.006
We're not evil.

00:15:16.026 --> 00:15:16.687
Committed crimes?

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.810
No.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:17.890
No.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.673
No crimes?

00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:20.194
No.

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:21.497
We're protected by you.

00:15:21.517 --> 00:15:21.898
No cell.

00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:22.840
Not locked up.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.461
No.

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:25.144
Yes.

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:27.710
It's just a big misunderstanding, okay?

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.914
What does this mean?

00:15:30.923 --> 00:15:33.526
I'm at the end of this.

00:15:34.407 --> 00:15:36.249
The next ENReco chapter.

00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:40.073
Chapter 3 was announced as well.

00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:41.255
Broken Bones.

00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:41.996
Broken Bones?

00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:43.097
Do you remember what it's called?

00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:44.839
Broken Bones.

00:15:46.481 --> 00:15:51.266
Well, we'll have to look forward to the next chapter of ENReco.

00:15:51.546 --> 00:15:52.107
TBD.

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:54.049
TBD.

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.149
TBD.

00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:55.291
Not Broken Bones.

00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:56.492
Broken...

00:15:56.692 --> 00:15:59.195
BAU BAU!

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:00.796
Thank you!

00:16:02.218 --> 00:16:10.446
Thank you FUWAMOCO listeners!

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:13.989
Thank you for supporting all of us!

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:17.493
BAU BAU!

00:16:17.513 --> 00:16:20.176
You had a lot of fun!

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:21.657
So much fun!

00:16:21.677 --> 00:16:24.640
Moco-chan, you had some interesting dreams recently.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:29.678
Now, um... I will pervase this.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.303
Uh oh, Ruffians.

00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:39.934
This dream happened, you know when you just sort of fall asleep a bit and you're like... I was like that.

00:16:39.954 --> 00:16:40.334
Dream.

00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:42.898
Do you have that happen often?

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:46.261
Dream segment is back!

00:16:46.702 --> 00:16:49.967
Yeah, Mococo dream, yeah!

00:16:49.987 --> 00:16:50.448
You have that?

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.371
Yeah, speedrun dream, yeah.

00:16:52.391 --> 00:16:54.654
Yeah, the speedrun dream where you're like, was I sleeping?

00:16:54.674 --> 00:16:55.576
Oh, but I had a dream.

00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:57.058
Yeah.

00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:57.178
Yeah.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.340
Uh-oh.

00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:01.225
Well, I had a dream!

00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:05.211
I had a dream about Gigi!

00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:06.934
Oh, Gigi!

00:17:06.954 --> 00:17:13.003
Yeah, and I feel like, although this was a dream, I feel like it could have been real.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.004
I also saw that Gigi had a dream about Calli-senpai.

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:20.806
Why does this always happen, huh?

00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:25.371
It could be a nightmare.

00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:26.452
If Gigi is in it, does that mean it's a nightmare?

00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:28.394
Automatic nightmare status.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:30.657
I don't think it was a nightmare.

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:31.117
But!

00:17:31.298 --> 00:17:31.618
But!

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:34.781
Gigi was probably a nightmare in my dream, huh?

00:17:35.162 --> 00:17:35.923
Okay, well!

00:17:36.383 --> 00:17:38.265
I'll start the story here, okay?

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:40.639
So, we're listening.

00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:53.655
So, in my dream, Gigi, she had discovered the hidden legendary recipe to the best meatballs.

00:17:53.635 --> 00:18:12.589
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:15.652
So they needed to get her legendary meatballs.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:20.398
And at one point, she was running with them on a plate.

00:18:21.178 --> 00:18:23.801
And then, she said this is a no-no.

00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.163
I can't control it!

00:18:25.243 --> 00:18:26.624
It was GG okay!

00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:31.730
And she tripped and she landed onto her meatballs.

00:18:33.472 --> 00:18:35.254
She had tears in her eyes.

00:18:35.274 --> 00:18:39.218
She sort of looked up like... And then,

00:18:39.198 --> 00:19:01.257
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.514
Well, they were safe.

00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:04.995
They were safe.

00:19:05.015 --> 00:19:06.879
She protected them with her life.

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:08.242
I protected them with her life now.

00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:11.449
That was my dream.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.938
What you did, you both!

00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:17.642
Yes!

00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:20.555
I don't know, I feel like this could be real though.

00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:26.384
I feel like this could be real despite the fact that maybe I would make meatballs more likely than Gigi, but we'd have to ask her.

00:19:26.704 --> 00:19:27.746
Right, I don't know.

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:31.271
I think Gigi might have a legendary meatball recipe, no?

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:37.842
If you kind of blur your eyes, Gigi just kind of looks like a big meatball, right?

00:19:37.862 --> 00:19:38.262
What?

00:19:38.283 --> 00:19:39.084
Is that the secret?

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:40.526
Is that the secret to her recipe?

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:46.195
Become the legendary meatball.

00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:51.100
She has the same sort of color of a meatball.

00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:52.222
A shiny meatball.

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:56.426
Well, that was lucky.

00:19:56.787 --> 00:19:59.450
It's a good thing she protected the legendary meatballs.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.674
It'd be bad, you know, sharing the legendary meatballs with the rest of the world.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:04.435
I know.

00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:06.237
The world would be destroyed.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.339
Great.

00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:08.220
Too much.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.802
Too much for it.

00:20:10.822 --> 00:20:11.463
Save the world.

00:20:14.527 --> 00:20:14.967
BAU BAU!

00:20:15.908 --> 00:20:17.619
Yeah.

00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:19.088
Can't control the dreams, right?

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.276
It's what happens.

00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:21.463
It's what happens.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.817
It's just word, okay?

00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:27.698
You have to believe.

00:20:27.718 --> 00:20:32.266
BAU BAU!

00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:39.978
You know, FUWAMOCO, we had some nice time to ourselves recently.

00:20:39.998 --> 00:20:43.444
I say ourselves, but it's not just ourselves.

00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:47.991
Because we got to see Biboo and Nerissa!

00:20:48.764 --> 00:20:53.331
Lots of Biboo and Nerissa just hanging out, you know.

00:20:53.792 --> 00:21:00.001
And actually we went over and had another party with Nerissa and Biboo all of a sudden earlier.

00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:02.224
That's maybe why we're maybe a bit late.

00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:07.532
You know, and then we just hung out with them the other day too.

00:21:07.512 --> 00:21:11.976
We got to spend a bunch of time with them.

00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:13.438
We're super duper happy!

00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:18.042
We did have Nerissa's famous nabe.

00:21:18.062 --> 00:21:21.245
We promptly burned our mouths on the kabocha.

00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:24.428
But it's because Nerissa was so nice.

00:21:24.448 --> 00:21:26.250
She had one nabe that had onions.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.093
And one nabe that didn't have onions for us.

00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:32.095
And FUWAMOCO we kind of showed up a little bit late.

00:21:32.476 --> 00:21:34.758
And so she was like, okay well I'll make it now.

00:21:34.898 --> 00:21:37.080
So it's nice and hot for FUWAMOCO.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:42.307
I love FUWAMOCO so much.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.731
It's burnt in my mouth.

00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:45.512
There's green onion in it!

00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:48.436
Oh, it wasn't in there!

00:21:48.456 --> 00:21:51.841
It was in a different pot.

00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:52.141
I love onions.

00:21:52.161 --> 00:21:52.642
But you don't!

00:21:52.662 --> 00:21:53.603
I felt lots of love.

00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:56.888
And we brought ingredients too!

00:21:56.908 --> 00:21:58.670
Moco-chan was like, don't bring anything!

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.312
Nerissa has everything!

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:03.937
And it was all eaten, so... Right!

00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:05.319
Right!

00:22:05.339 --> 00:22:05.920
You don't!

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.125
It was so yummy.

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:09.608
It was nice you know.

00:22:09.968 --> 00:22:16.121
And for dessert we had strawberries and watermelon.

00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:18.166
We did not bring crickets.

00:22:18.186 --> 00:22:18.486
No.

00:22:18.526 --> 00:22:19.669
We could have though.

00:22:19.849 --> 00:22:20.350
We could have.

00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:24.960
But you know Nerissa was eating the watermelon and chit-chatting.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.064
And Nerissa was crossing her legs.

00:22:27.044 --> 00:22:47.871
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:47.851 --> 00:22:48.795
Wait, I'm not.

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:52.389
You can't be so stinky, right?

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:52.630
What?

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.076
No, that was just watermelon.

00:22:54.096 --> 00:22:57.209
It's watermelon.

00:22:57.229 --> 00:22:57.410
See ya!

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:57.972
Bye!

00:22:58.213 --> 00:22:58.755
It was just funny.

00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:05.717
I'm late but we had a nice big long group hug.

00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:15.615
We were all being silly and you know there was a chair open in the corner and we were like this.

00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:15.775
Shiori!

00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:15.936
Shiori!

00:23:15.956 --> 00:23:16.156
Shiori!

00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:18.561
You know in our hearts.

00:23:18.681 --> 00:23:21.185
Yeah we had it in our hearts.

00:23:21.626 --> 00:23:22.969
Yeah big cuddle puddle yeah.

00:23:22.989 --> 00:23:23.089
Yeah.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:26.294
Did you give them the omiyage we did?

00:23:27.075 --> 00:23:27.356
We did!

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:29.379
Yeah, Nerissa really liked hers.

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:35.028
And we got all excited to be able to, you know, have fun and chat together.

00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:35.148
Yeah.

00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:39.175
And we forgot that Biboo didn't open hers.

00:23:39.195 --> 00:23:42.801
So we'll have to see what she thinks if she understands what it is.

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:43.001
Right.

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:45.004
Maybe it's a bit complicated.

00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:46.807
But she's a sleeping rock.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:47.929
Yeah.

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:51.027
By the end we always have to roll her out of there high.

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:52.154
Right.

00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:53.683
Yeah.

00:23:55.486 --> 00:23:56.647
Yeah, did she open it?

00:23:56.667 --> 00:24:00.751
Not quite yet, but we can look forward to it, right?

00:24:01.472 --> 00:24:04.375
But it was just nice, you know?

00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:05.836
It was being silly together.

00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:07.117
Yeah, very silly.

00:24:07.137 --> 00:24:11.201
We went on a walk too together, didn't we?

00:24:11.221 --> 00:24:15.866
Yeah, so... We hope we can hang out all together more.

00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:19.830
And sing with other senpai and kouhai too!

00:24:22.773 --> 00:24:23.974
You know...

00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:28.053
Warm inside now from Nerissa's nabe.

00:24:28.073 --> 00:24:31.437
Yeah, and a hug.

00:24:31.457 --> 00:24:31.798
BAU BAU!

00:24:31.818 --> 00:24:36.684
Although, you know, we talk about this big long group hug like it's not a regular thing.

00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:37.165
Oh, true.

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:38.386
It's a pretty regular thing.

00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:39.568
Pretty regular thing, huh?

00:24:41.971 --> 00:24:43.953
BAU BAU!

00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:49.220
Speaking of regular, should we take a look at some of our regular corners here?

00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:51.623
First, with the Doggie of the Day!

00:24:52.244 --> 00:24:52.324
Yes!

00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:56.565
Well, today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.624
It's Shen!

00:25:03.346 --> 00:25:03.707
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:03.727 --> 00:25:03.827
Look!

00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:05.352
Look at that!

00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:07.657
Sleepy Queen.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.080
It's so pretty!

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.682
Her little paws are so cute.

00:25:14.343 --> 00:25:15.704
And the royal pillow.

00:25:17.386 --> 00:25:18.307
Pillow only for Shen.

00:25:18.907 --> 00:25:22.511
So cute.

00:25:23.251 --> 00:25:27.836
Moco-chan, how does Shen bow-bow?

00:25:27.956 --> 00:25:30.719
I feel like she sounds like Princess Ebony.

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:33.381
You know, like, bow-bow.

00:25:35.048 --> 00:25:36.391
Is that Princess Evaniya?

00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:38.555
BAU BAU!

00:25:38.575 --> 00:25:44.708
Is that Princess Evaniya?

00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:48.516
Cat.

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.901
Raccoon plushie.

00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:51.302
Mouse.

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:54.106
This is Shen.

00:25:54.126 --> 00:25:55.508
She's the Doggie of the Day.

00:25:55.528 --> 00:25:55.608
Yes!

00:25:58.351 --> 00:25:59.392
BAU BAU!

00:25:59.412 --> 00:25:59.572
BAU BAU!

00:25:59.592 --> 00:26:06.940
I know Shen might look like a queen here, but she's super duper friendly and always welcoming to new people.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.721
Yes, and a good queen should be hot, right?

00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:09.182
Yes.

00:26:09.482 --> 00:26:13.126
More friends means more head pats, right?

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:13.807
Oh, right!

00:26:13.827 --> 00:26:14.828
We definitely get that.

00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:15.408
Yeah.

00:26:15.488 --> 00:26:17.070
Understood.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:28.410
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:33.481
I've seen many of your vlogs recently.

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:34.462
Thank you for sharing them with us!

00:26:34.482 --> 00:26:38.586
Let's take a look at one vlog on today I went on a walk.

00:26:38.747 --> 00:26:40.769
De-den!

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:42.611
Dinosaurs!

00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:45.774
Oh my gosh, that's too cool!

00:26:45.794 --> 00:26:49.378
FUWAMOCO and the dinosaurs!

00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:51.260
Thank you for taking us here with you!

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:51.541
BAU BAU!

00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:52.342
See all the bones!

00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:57.267
I don't think we've ever seen dinosaur bones before.

00:26:57.247 --> 00:27:04.096
Stegosaurus.

00:27:05.718 --> 00:27:16.993
That's a dinosaur!

00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:20.241
I think you know my favorite dinosaur.

00:27:20.662 --> 00:27:22.104
Moco-chan, you like the Triceratops?

00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:22.704
I like the Triceratops.

00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:24.206
You're not being influenced, are you?

00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:26.089
No, I like the Triceratops!

00:27:26.109 --> 00:27:29.633
I like the spiky, the spiky, the spiky dinosaur.

00:27:29.653 --> 00:27:30.434
The spiky one.

00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:33.558
I like the dinosaurs that look funny and are in the water, too.

00:27:34.299 --> 00:27:34.759
Those ones.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:35.921
Yeah.

00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:38.263
And the fluffy ones, too!

00:27:39.084 --> 00:27:39.285
Yeah.

00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:40.286
The spiky one.

00:27:40.606 --> 00:27:42.829
Maybe the fluffy ones are hot.

00:27:44.682 --> 00:28:07.770
BAU BAU!

00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:13.856
And we have next a Question of the Day!

00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:18.001
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:25.030
What are my favorite things to do with my siblings and introduce them to anime and watch it with them to see their reaction?

00:28:25.491 --> 00:28:27.673
Have you two ever done this with each other?

00:28:27.713 --> 00:28:30.297
Anybody otaku?

00:28:30.317 --> 00:28:33.300
If so, what's one of your favorite ones to get people to watch?

00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:35.203
I don't know if we've done this with each other.

00:28:35.223 --> 00:28:36.424
No, not really.

00:28:36.544 --> 00:28:37.065
No.

00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:50.384
But you know, many, many, many, many hundreds of years ago, you know, there was a time when sometimes we want to share the anime that we like with the demon dogs from Demon God Dog TV.

00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:54.569
So you know, you try to sit down, you know, let's watch this.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.571
This is really cool.

00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.412
You better watch this.

00:28:56.432 --> 00:28:56.893
Let's watch it.

00:28:56.913 --> 00:28:57.814
You like it.

00:28:58.695 --> 00:28:59.096
It's my choice.

00:28:59.156 --> 00:28:59.256
Yeah.

00:28:59.236 --> 00:29:01.620
But then, you know, they don't really pay attention.

00:29:02.201 --> 00:29:07.390
And then, things happen and they're like, oh, oh, I, I, I was talking, what was that?

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.311
What just happened?

00:29:09.393 --> 00:29:12.979
FUWAMOCO in this situation is... No, no.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.201
You missed it, you missed it.

00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:14.942
It's your fault.

00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:15.784
I'm not explaining it.

00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:16.725
We're not going back.

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:17.667
No, no.

00:29:18.693 --> 00:29:24.127
We're personally attacked, why are you not watching it?

00:29:24.347 --> 00:29:25.310
I'm watching!

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.891
What?

00:29:25.911 --> 00:29:32.608
I brought you here to watch it and you're not watching it so now it's your fault!

00:29:32.628 --> 00:29:35.615
Do you feel how I love this?

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:36.297
Maybe this is a bit high.

00:29:36.277 --> 00:29:39.761
That's the coolest reaction, thank you!

00:29:42.284 --> 00:29:43.065
High skill issue!

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:44.627
Maybe just a bit hoarse, huh?

00:29:44.647 --> 00:29:47.331
Yeah, we went all over all together.

00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:48.953
We were at Calli-senpai's.

00:29:48.973 --> 00:29:51.095
She wanted to show us that movie.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.598
The one movie we were all sitting down watching it.

00:29:53.738 --> 00:29:57.944
And then nobody was watching it.

00:29:57.964 --> 00:29:58.945
And we were just talking and screaming over it.

00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:01.548
And she's so patient and then explaining it.

00:30:01.568 --> 00:30:03.410
The prestige, thank you, the prestige.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.832
She's explaining it.

00:30:04.812 --> 00:30:07.136
Explaining it over and over like the whole movie.

00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:09.039
She's just explaining what happens.

00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:11.564
I'm like wow, that is not us.

00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:14.589
No, that is not our reaction.

00:30:14.609 --> 00:30:14.909
Patience.

00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:15.931
Very patient.

00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:17.213
Wow.

00:30:18.736 --> 00:30:20.599
I'm like it's okay, Calli-senpai.

00:30:20.659 --> 00:30:23.324
We'll watch the procedure here another time.

00:30:24.686 --> 00:30:26.569
We were trying very hard to follow.

00:30:26.609 --> 00:30:27.912
We were, we were, yes.

00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:28.693
You know, but...

00:30:28.673 --> 00:30:32.381
Yeah, I feel a little bit nostalgic and impressed at the same time.

00:30:37.111 --> 00:30:40.278
But I think you know our favorite one to get people to watch.

00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:44.006
I was recommending School Days to Subaru-senpai recently.

00:30:44.026 --> 00:30:46.732
True, but I think movies are also good too.

00:30:46.752 --> 00:30:47.053
You know?

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:52.481
I would like to see Subaru-senpai's reaction to school days.

00:30:52.561 --> 00:30:53.642
I feel like she would.

00:30:54.484 --> 00:30:55.685
She watches a lot of anime.

00:30:55.705 --> 00:30:57.087
Right now she's watching Fate Stay Night.

00:30:57.408 --> 00:30:58.990
Isn't that an interesting choice?

00:31:00.873 --> 00:31:03.276
School days is the next step, right?

00:31:03.496 --> 00:31:04.218
It makes sense.

00:31:04.338 --> 00:31:09.906
We're waiting for Subaru-senpai!

00:31:09.926 --> 00:31:10.106
BAU BAU!

00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:10.346
Surprise?

00:31:10.426 --> 00:31:10.887
I don't know.

00:31:11.748 --> 00:31:12.990
We'll see.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.154
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:31:17.554 --> 00:31:20.217
We're always waiting for more questions of the day!

00:31:20.437 --> 00:31:21.878
Doggies of the day!

00:31:22.158 --> 00:31:25.641
Your walks doesn't have to be the walk of the day, but you know, a walk.

00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:26.242
I walk.

00:31:26.682 --> 00:31:30.366
Or, you know, you happen to see Pero, it's best to let everybody know.

00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:34.770
So, please let us know with the hashtag!

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.851
Hashtag!

00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:36.111
FWMCMORNING!

00:31:37.952 --> 00:31:38.113
BAU BAU!

00:31:39.094 --> 00:31:39.234
Got it!

00:31:39.254 --> 00:31:40.315
Thank you!

00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:42.977
And we have another stream coming up!

00:31:42.957 --> 00:31:47.041
Pretty soon, our next gym is De-den!

00:31:48.202 --> 00:31:56.230
Metal Gear Solid 3.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.552
Snake Eater.

00:31:57.572 --> 00:31:57.672
Yeah!

00:31:57.692 --> 00:31:59.153
We're continuing playing Metal Gear Solid 3 on the PS2!

00:31:59.173 --> 00:32:02.036
Recently, you know, we got some more fashion choices.

00:32:02.056 --> 00:32:08.863
They help us do the camouflage thing, which is helpful because it helps do the stealth thing sometimes.

00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:10.935
CQC.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.140
I got it this time.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:13.240
CQC!

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.421
CQC!

00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:14.563
What does it mean, Moco-chan?

00:32:17.009 --> 00:32:17.210
Combat.

00:32:18.092 --> 00:32:20.979
Quarters.

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:21.380
Horse.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:21.520
Horse.

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:46.360
This week is the unofficial PS2 week!

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.544
What's more on PS2 is Advent!

00:32:49.564 --> 00:32:53.770
We're gonna be playing some Jump Box games all together over on Biboo's channel.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.271
It's been a while.

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:56.073
It's been way too long.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:59.598
So we're looking forward to some extra silly moments there.

00:32:59.999 --> 00:33:06.347
And then we'll be playing Fatal Frame for the very first time on PS2, the legendary horror game.

00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:08.130
Join us for the beginning of it all.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.295
Yeah, and you know, we'll see how that goes.

00:33:12.315 --> 00:33:15.840
A little scary, but PS2 comfy.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.557
I don't know if you have to look at the ghost.

00:33:19.577 --> 00:33:20.904
At the camera.

00:33:20.924 --> 00:33:24.480
I really don't like cameras or windows or doors.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.042
Well, we'll see how it goes.

00:33:27.142 --> 00:33:33.768
And in between, over on Nui-senpai's channel, is the Animal Tower Battle Tournament!

00:33:33.788 --> 00:33:36.651
This is the second time that she's hosted it.

00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:39.614
The first time was very interesting, very surprising.

00:33:39.755 --> 00:33:46.161
It's a simple game where you have to stack animals on top of each other to make the biggest tower and beat your opponent.

00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:47.803
The first one crushed them.

00:33:47.823 --> 00:33:49.344
The couple loses.

00:33:49.585 --> 00:33:51.987
At FUWAMOCO, we're pretty good, right?

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:56.023
Ruffians, we put it together before you know it.

00:33:56.043 --> 00:33:57.685
It's a simple but tricky game.

00:33:58.065 --> 00:34:00.829
So we hope that you'll see us rise to the top.

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:04.433
The top of the Animal Tower over on Ruri-senpai's channel.

00:34:04.453 --> 00:34:07.697
And then back to some Fatal Frame we saw.

00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:10.681
Thank you Ruffians!

00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:15.747
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is...

00:34:15.727 --> 00:34:17.589
BAU BAU people!

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:21.192

00:34:22.273 --> 00:34:23.214

00:34:23.274 --> 00:34:28.880
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:29.280
BAU BAU!

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.126
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.147

00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:37.969
BAU BAU!

00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:39.350
Frankccino!

00:34:39.731 --> 00:34:41.873
BAU BAU!

00:34:41.893 --> 00:34:42.714
Owakami Yuki!

00:34:43.094 --> 00:34:43.995
BAU BAU!

00:34:43.975 --> 00:35:06.152
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:06.132 --> 00:35:14.489
Add to every other Ruffian out there.

00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:19.580
We hope you have a howl of a day!

00:35:20.141 --> 00:35:23.167
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:26.875
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>
