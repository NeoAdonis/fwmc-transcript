[ArcLL_Maru](https://twitter.com/ArcLL_Maru/status/1700995081074057220) asks FUWAMOCO-sensei for material recommendations to study Japanese. They recommended to start with the [Genki textbooks](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/intro/), not overwhelming yourself with kanji studies just when you're starting, and being OK with making mistakes; that's just part of learning. 日本語を勉強しているラッフィアンの皆さん、頑張ってね！
