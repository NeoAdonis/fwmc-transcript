05:14.740 --> 05:17.164
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:17.685 --> 05:21.069
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:21.089 --> 05:23.673
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:23.693 --> 05:23.833
Yo!

05:30.050 --> 05:31.150
BAU BAU!

05:31.510 --> 05:34.551
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:35.011 --> 05:37.332
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:37.612 --> 05:41.033
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:41.073 --> 05:42.373
BAU BAU!

05:42.393 --> 05:47.414
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:47.434 --> 05:49.055
Thank you, ruffians!

05:49.495 --> 05:52.155
Thank you for joining us for our 50th episode!

05:52.235 --> 05:52.856
BAU BAU!

05:52.916 --> 05:53.716
Thank you!

06:00.247 --> 06:00.576
BAU!

06:02.396 --> 06:03.276
The 50th episode!

06:03.396 --> 06:03.756
Right!

06:04.496 --> 06:05.117
Suddenly!

06:05.157 --> 06:06.317
We're here!

06:06.337 --> 06:06.317
50!

06:06.657 --> 06:07.857
BAU BAU!

06:08.497 --> 06:10.337
BAU BAU!

06:10.377 --> 06:11.758
Thank you, Mocos!

06:12.198 --> 06:13.418
Wow.

06:13.498 --> 06:18.579
Just because today is the 50th episode doesn't mean it might not be your first episode.

06:19.059 --> 06:19.699
Right!

06:20.339 --> 06:20.919
Exactly.

06:21.219 --> 06:30.561
Ruffians, if you're joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:32.003 --> 06:32.623
Or a.k.a.

06:32.923 --> 06:33.844
FUWAMOCO!

06:35.625 --> 06:39.046
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:39.627 --> 06:44.729
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:44.829 --> 06:49.571
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FUWAMOCOMORNING!

06:50.532 --> 06:51.992
FWMCMORNING!

06:53.633 --> 06:55.134
Even if it's the 50th time.

06:56.303 --> 06:57.504
Still can't quite do it.

06:58.344 --> 06:59.345
It's a learning process.

06:59.445 --> 07:06.248
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:06.268 --> 07:09.130
BAU BAU!

07:09.370 --> 07:09.810
BAU BAU!

07:09.870 --> 07:10.630
BAU BAU!

07:11.251 --> 07:14.872
Thank you Ruffians!

07:14.972 --> 07:16.193
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

07:16.273 --> 07:17.374
I got distracted.

07:17.414 --> 07:18.174
Ruffians.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.415
Ruffians are distracting Moco-chan.

07:20.495 --> 07:21.876
There's too many colors.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.117
BAU BAU!

07:23.157 --> 07:24.257
BAU BAU!

07:25.238 --> 07:25.698
Wow.

07:26.587 --> 07:29.450
Ruffians, you've been keeping your eyes open, right?

07:29.550 --> 07:33.393
Maybe you've been seeing Pero around a little bit.

07:34.194 --> 07:35.936
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

07:37.878 --> 07:44.244
It's good to know that he's still doing okay, but I hope that everything's going okay for you, Ruffians.

07:44.304 --> 07:48.047
Sometimes maybe it's a not-so-great thing.

07:49.288 --> 07:50.730
Did you see him again?

07:52.779 --> 07:55.400
Well, today we have a ruffian that spotted him.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.441
Let's see where he is!

07:57.121 --> 07:58.342
De-den!

07:58.822 --> 07:59.002
Huh?

07:59.623 --> 07:59.963
Huh?

08:00.403 --> 08:00.783
Hi.

08:01.103 --> 08:02.204
Pero's gone!

08:02.724 --> 08:03.124
Hi!

08:03.705 --> 08:06.226
You found Pero in your kitchen?

08:07.307 --> 08:08.827
Maybe he got hungry.

08:08.847 --> 08:15.571
It looks like he got stuck in a container of... Lard.

08:16.031 --> 08:18.632
That lard is fat, right?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.114
Who's fat though?

08:25.433 --> 08:25.873
I don't know.

08:25.893 --> 08:26.753
I'm concerned.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.894
It looks white.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.035
Maybe.

08:30.895 --> 08:32.435
Is it Pero's fat?

08:33.016 --> 08:34.156
It's the same color.

08:36.197 --> 08:42.699
Well, if it was his, couldn't he squeeze it out of himself and into the container and then escape?

08:44.079 --> 08:48.661
You know he'd be a few pounds lighter, right?

08:49.161 --> 08:49.701
Right?

08:49.761 --> 08:51.002
That could work, ruffians!

08:53.203 --> 08:54.804
This is how we're gonna start off episode 50!

08:54.845 --> 08:57.507
This is how we're gonna do it!

08:57.947 --> 09:00.330
If I was in a situation... Eww!

09:00.350 --> 09:01.351
Eww!

09:01.411 --> 09:01.751
Yes!

09:02.051 --> 09:02.411
Eww!

09:02.432 --> 09:08.157
I don't know, I'd be careful, you know?

09:08.177 --> 09:14.623
Not only Pero was sitting in there, but that line might be also from him, you know?

09:16.044 --> 09:16.744
Pero Lord.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.325
I don't think Pero hibernates though.

09:19.365 --> 09:27.568
Maybe he's just kind of looking to get a bit fluffy before the cold temperatures get really cold in the Northwest Passage.

09:28.689 --> 09:29.289
I don't know.

09:29.329 --> 09:33.930
It's not really necessary if he's going all over the place in the human world now, right?

09:33.950 --> 09:35.331
Because he went to Florida, right?

09:36.251 --> 09:40.673
But maybe it's just a seasonal habit he just can't shake off now.

09:43.054 --> 09:43.574
Poor Pero.

09:44.739 --> 09:45.119
Oh well.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.722
We hope that you threw out the lard afterwards, okay?

09:48.742 --> 09:49.603
Please throw it out.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.425
It's not good to eat.

09:51.745 --> 09:53.747
No, we're consuming that.

09:53.867 --> 09:57.490
But we still didn't know who's fat it was in the first place, right?

09:58.811 --> 09:59.371
Garbage.

10:00.272 --> 10:02.454
BAU BAU!

10:04.656 --> 10:08.599
Wow, ruffians are really fighting peril in a lot of different places.

10:10.220 --> 10:10.761
That's weird.

10:12.535 --> 10:12.816
But!

10:13.318 --> 10:15.183
Happy news!

10:15.764 --> 10:16.567
Ruffians!

10:18.908 --> 10:26.111
I know you let us know yesterday, but our brand new cover song of Kanae's Identity has hit 200,000 views!

10:26.151 --> 10:31.513
Thank you, BAU BAU!

10:31.913 --> 10:35.714
Thank you so much for loving it lots and lots, Ruffians!

10:35.814 --> 10:38.916
It's only been three days, so we've really been listening to it lots.

10:39.396 --> 10:40.516
Right.

10:40.656 --> 10:41.897
We're so fast, right?

10:42.777 --> 10:47.280
We've seen so many really nice comments, and it really warmed our hearts.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.441
Yeah, it makes us want to sing so much more.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.202
All for you, Ruffians.

10:51.222 --> 10:53.344
Thank you.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.025
You know, we know, you know.

10:55.525 --> 10:57.346
We know, we know, we know what?

10:57.827 --> 11:03.430
We know you know how much it means to us, but really, really, thank you!

11:03.991 --> 11:05.411
BAU BAU!

11:05.812 --> 11:08.874
Please look forward to more cover songs and music in the future, okay?

11:09.994 --> 11:13.097
BAU BAU!

11:13.257 --> 11:14.618
Wow, ruffians!

11:15.179 --> 11:18.622
There's also something else that we kind of heard about.

11:18.642 --> 11:19.343
We heard about it.

11:19.503 --> 11:21.464
I didn't think... Wow.

11:22.085 --> 11:24.067
I'm a bit surprised about this one.

11:24.387 --> 11:26.249
A bit surprised!

11:26.269 --> 11:30.532
No, we heard... We were nominated for the VTuber Awards!

11:30.552 --> 11:30.673
Yes!

11:36.128 --> 11:45.832
You know, we are just newbies, but we are nominated for this for a category called League of Their Own.

11:45.852 --> 11:57.516
You know, you can vote for which Vtuber you feel most fits the prestigious titles they have, and in this category, there are three others, including Marine-senchou-senpai!

11:57.937 --> 11:58.517
You know it!

11:58.677 --> 12:00.918
That's pretty amazing.

12:01.198 --> 12:01.558
I don't know.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.110
You know, we're still brand new.

12:04.411 --> 12:07.375
It's hard to compare us to such an amazing senpai.

12:07.395 --> 12:09.838
But you know!

12:10.578 --> 12:19.185
Before, we talked to Mane-chan about how we really admire Mane-senshu-senpai and we really want to be doing amazing things like her when we're seniors like her too!

12:19.265 --> 12:21.566
Yeah, when we're seniors too.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.228
But, you know, it is true though.

12:24.268 --> 12:28.712
We're very much something different for better or for worse.

12:29.192 --> 12:34.696
You know, Shiori and Yappi, twin demon white dog sisters that like to BAU BAU!

12:34.776 --> 12:38.059
Hold a morning show like this one three times a week, you know.

12:38.919 --> 12:45.964
We play games in our own unique FUWAMOCO way!

12:45.984 --> 12:48.986
You know, Metal Gear Solid and Least About Us.

12:49.006 --> 12:49.786
Sneaking.

12:50.127 --> 12:50.527
Yes.

12:51.187 --> 12:56.311
You know, we sing songs very silly multiple times a month.

12:56.431 --> 12:57.231
Very silly.

12:57.291 --> 13:03.135
Yeah, you know, we do things a bit out of the box like telling your spooky stories and you know, whatnot.

13:03.155 --> 13:04.216
Those kind of things because

13:04.676 --> 13:08.642
We feel really strongly that you are a part of this, ruffians, you know?

13:08.943 --> 13:10.144
A part of our journey.

13:10.465 --> 13:12.368
You're a part of us, you know?

13:12.868 --> 13:17.095
But, I guess FUWAMOCO, we're one and only.

13:17.115 --> 13:18.217
Or two and only.

13:18.237 --> 13:18.878
Two and only.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.516
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

13:24.596 --> 13:26.438
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

13:38.286 --> 13:41.729
We also hope that maybe it could be to lead to more ruffians.

13:41.809 --> 13:43.851
New ruffians finding us too!

13:44.411 --> 13:46.092
Please check it out, okay?

13:46.493 --> 13:47.513
Awesome!

13:47.654 --> 13:52.397
Many of our wonderful senpai have been nominated for other categories too!

13:52.798 --> 13:59.443
But Advent's own gaming rug, Biboo, has been nominated for Gamer of the Year.

14:03.672 --> 14:05.414
Although you should look for Bijou.

14:05.474 --> 14:06.395
Bijou, yeah.

14:06.435 --> 14:08.176
You might get confused.

14:08.216 --> 14:08.536
Yeah.

14:08.677 --> 14:11.319
But we're really happy!

14:11.359 --> 14:14.622
She's definitely the gamer of our heart and she really rocks.

14:14.762 --> 14:17.044
So she's got our vote for sure!

14:19.586 --> 14:20.427
Thank you, Ruffians!

14:20.487 --> 14:21.168
Thank you!

14:21.468 --> 14:26.252
Please don't forget you can vote right now at their website, thevtuberawards.com.

14:26.292 --> 14:27.213
If you would like to.

14:27.614 --> 14:29.475
We would like that if you voted for us.

14:29.515 --> 14:29.715
Right?

14:30.596 --> 14:34.759
If you would like to.

14:35.220 --> 14:36.421
BAU BAU!

14:37.001 --> 14:37.722
Happy!

14:38.002 --> 14:43.826
Advent, we're still just newbies, but yeah.

14:43.846 --> 14:44.787
BAU BAU!

14:45.327 --> 14:49.591
Well, we have some interesting news for you, huh, Ruffians?

14:50.560 --> 14:56.562
Ruffians, you know, sometimes we mention Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy, right?

14:57.162 --> 14:57.583
Right.

14:58.023 --> 14:58.603
Sometimes.

14:58.663 --> 15:01.304
Yeah, they like games and video games.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.925
Not card games, video games.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.085
But card games too, I guess.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.426
Card games too, yeah, that's true.

15:05.526 --> 15:09.767
And you know, books and science fiction and all those kind of good stuff.

15:09.787 --> 15:15.449
And you know, they're very obviously very important to us too.

15:15.469 --> 15:16.450
We love them.

15:16.950 --> 15:17.630
We love them.

15:17.690 --> 15:17.870
Yeah.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.981
Do we have a picture, Mococo-chan?

15:27.082 --> 15:29.403
My picture is not a secret.

15:29.483 --> 15:31.704
This is what they look like.

15:32.104 --> 15:33.484
There's us there too.

15:33.764 --> 15:39.947
But you know, I guess we talked about before how they only BAU BAU and they're not very good at English.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.428
And that's why they can't make their appearance here with us, you know?

15:43.488 --> 15:45.449
Yeah, dull appearances.

15:45.889 --> 15:51.051
Yeah, but Mama Puppy has been practicing her English recently.

15:53.499 --> 16:00.023
Thought that maybe, maybe you'd be happy if you could meet them one day.

16:02.185 --> 16:05.967
So, we have something to announce.

16:06.148 --> 16:08.809
Something to announce!

16:10.569 --> 16:20.395
If we reach our goal of a certain amount of ruffians subscribed to our channel, Mama Puppy will make a guest appearance!

16:20.435 --> 16:20.635
Yeah!

16:20.675 --> 16:21.976
Papa Puppy's appearance is TBD.

16:21.996 --> 16:22.136
TBD.

16:22.456 --> 16:23.116
TBD.

16:23.296 --> 16:29.680
Yeah, you know Papa Puppy's a bit of a rough Papa Puppy and shy, too.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.300
A bit shy.

16:30.621 --> 16:31.021
But!

16:32.001 --> 16:32.642
But!

16:33.642 --> 16:36.224
That goal... Are you ready, ruffians?

16:36.244 --> 16:37.505
The goal, do you want to hear the goal?

16:37.525 --> 16:39.646
That goal...

16:41.108 --> 16:56.641
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

16:57.577 --> 16:59.419
Yeah, 5 million!

16:59.459 --> 17:01.301
You heard right, Nerissa!

17:01.781 --> 17:02.702
5 million!

17:03.022 --> 17:05.085
Yes!

17:05.105 --> 17:07.247
5 million!

17:07.748 --> 17:08.949
Motainai!

17:09.089 --> 17:11.171
E chigau no e!

17:11.211 --> 17:13.434
Mama puppy still has a lot of English to learn, okay?

17:13.454 --> 17:14.555
She does, yeah.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.737
Papa puppy has a bit shy.

17:19.944 --> 17:24.226
BAU BAU!

17:24.326 --> 17:25.567
That's exciting!

17:25.587 --> 17:26.487
Exciting, right?

17:26.507 --> 17:27.628
Exciting!

17:27.888 --> 17:31.350
Not 5 trillion, it's just 5 million, okay?

17:31.390 --> 17:37.373
We can count the many days, weeks, months, years, decades, right?

17:37.393 --> 17:39.034
5 million is not that much.

17:39.194 --> 17:39.595
Right.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.561
Mama puppy we're talking about, okay?

17:43.621 --> 17:44.441
Mama puppy.

17:44.601 --> 17:50.384
Yeah, you know, it does take quite some time to learn some new tricks, right?

17:50.404 --> 17:51.024
Yeah, okay.

17:51.124 --> 17:52.164
Sorry, mama puppy.

17:54.705 --> 17:58.867
BAU BAU!

17:59.487 --> 18:04.069
Ruffians, today's our special 50th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.190
To be honest,

18:08.038 --> 18:17.806
We wanted things to be different, but... We wanted to do things differently today, but... Well... Sometimes things don't quite go as planned.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.168
And there's been another misunderstanding.

18:22.530 --> 18:25.232
There's been another misunderstanding.

18:26.353 --> 18:31.277
You know, Moco-chan... Moco-chan got a bit tongue-tied.

18:32.058 --> 18:36.842
And, uh... You said something... Uh... Well...

18:37.999 --> 18:43.666
Moco-chan didn't really know what she wanted to say in English the other day.

18:44.227 --> 18:47.852
We finished the game, but we finished Metal Gear Solid, right?

18:48.012 --> 18:48.212
But...

18:50.655 --> 18:53.557
So then Moco-chan said what she wanted to say in Japanese.

18:53.797 --> 18:54.658
Oh, yeah.

18:54.958 --> 18:56.319
That is just normal, you know.

18:56.799 --> 18:58.381
And usually Fuwawa will help me.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.482
It's normal for that to happen, right?

19:00.622 --> 19:00.922
Yeah.

19:01.323 --> 19:11.310
And I'll help, but... I think this time, ruffians, there was a lot of you thinking that I was being mean and said something totally wrong!

19:11.350 --> 19:12.430
But I wasn't!

19:12.851 --> 19:13.912
I was trying to help.

19:14.492 --> 19:14.812
No.

19:15.953 --> 19:16.213
Yeah.

19:16.754 --> 19:19.335
Well, Moco-chan, what did you say?

19:20.731 --> 19:28.855
Well, I said... I said... Nametara akan yo.

19:30.076 --> 19:34.838
You know, which is like, don't underestimate me or look down on me.

19:34.858 --> 19:39.080
But, Fuwawa helped by translating it as

19:43.112 --> 19:49.913
I was just helping, you know.

19:50.313 --> 19:52.614
It's actually the same, Ruffian!

19:52.994 --> 19:56.354
So, Japanese has different ways of writing things.

19:56.374 --> 20:00.735
So the first one, it's in hiragana, and the second one is in kanji.

20:00.995 --> 20:02.075
So you can tell the difference.

20:02.115 --> 20:03.676
They have different meanings, okay?

20:04.076 --> 20:05.896
You can tell from the context too!

20:06.356 --> 20:09.797
But, I guess it could also be a play on words sometimes.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.077
Yeah, and you know,

20:12.217 --> 20:16.602
I was just a bit confused.

20:16.642 --> 20:17.563
Were you really confused?

20:17.623 --> 20:18.144
I was!

20:18.304 --> 20:21.488
So don't think I'm a bad sister or anything, okay?

20:21.548 --> 20:22.249
Ruffians!

20:23.090 --> 20:24.992
Don't misunderstand, okay?

20:25.012 --> 20:26.494
It's cleared up now.

20:28.177 --> 20:30.058
Yeah, machigayasui!

20:30.239 --> 20:33.621
It's easy to make a mistake like this, okay?

20:34.001 --> 20:35.342
Ruffians, remember!

20:35.442 --> 20:39.906
Nametara akai iro!

20:40.046 --> 20:42.347
BAU BAU!

20:43.468 --> 20:44.809
No misunderstanding now!

20:44.829 --> 20:46.650
No misunderstandings.

20:48.011 --> 20:48.592
You got it?

20:49.072 --> 20:51.274
It's a bit of a lesson as well, okay?

20:54.493 --> 20:56.414
BAU BAU!

20:56.975 --> 20:59.676
Ruffians!

20:59.937 --> 21:02.998
Well, to make up for the misunderstanding, I guess.

21:04.719 --> 21:06.821
Is it okay to share with the ruffians?

21:08.922 --> 21:09.482
I guess.

21:09.842 --> 21:10.743
I guess.

21:11.783 --> 21:12.164
I guess.

21:12.304 --> 21:17.487
The other day, you might know from Twitter that

21:18.365 --> 21:19.625
Something good happened.

21:19.685 --> 21:23.327
Yeah, something very good happened, ruffians!

21:24.027 --> 21:24.767
It arrived!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.148
It arrived!

21:26.168 --> 21:28.408
A present.

21:29.769 --> 21:31.489
From YouTube!

21:31.509 --> 21:33.610
Ruffians!

21:35.250 --> 21:36.751
I saw my play button arrive!

21:44.483 --> 21:47.226
Thank you so much again!

21:47.266 --> 21:51.430
We tried to take a good photo without our reflections but...

21:54.137 --> 22:02.199
But, you know, we're so thankful for your support.

22:02.419 --> 22:04.980
For all of our senpai's hard work too.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.960
And to be able to call hololive our home now.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.560
Thank you!

22:09.620 --> 22:10.781
Thank you!

22:10.861 --> 22:11.901
And Ruffians, look!

22:12.381 --> 22:14.722
We even received two of them!

22:14.842 --> 22:16.462
We don't even have to share!

22:16.502 --> 22:19.262
We didn't even have to ask either!

22:19.402 --> 22:21.323
It really, really warmed our hearts.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.565
Thank you so much everyone!

22:24.585 --> 22:25.586
Thank you!

22:25.626 --> 22:27.308
We're continuing to wait.

22:27.328 --> 22:32.893
Can we take a photo with them?

22:32.973 --> 22:35.776
It's kind of funny we're taking a photo with a photo.

22:36.056 --> 22:36.997
It's a photo with a photo.

22:37.197 --> 22:37.397
Yeah.

22:37.798 --> 22:41.101
That means there's two Fuwawa and two Moco-chan.

22:41.181 --> 22:42.502
That's not going to be confusing.

22:44.284 --> 22:44.644
Maybe.

22:45.945 --> 22:47.327
Well, ruffians.

22:49.011 --> 22:59.319
We're gonna continue to work really hard and hopefully one day we can receive our Golden Play Button too!

22:59.359 --> 23:01.540
BAU BAU!

23:01.620 --> 23:02.961
BAU BAU!

23:03.522 --> 23:04.883
So exciting, right?

23:05.003 --> 23:05.603
Exciting!

23:06.504 --> 23:07.825
We're not trapped in it.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.146
Trapped!

23:09.166 --> 23:10.627
It's just a reflection, silly.

23:10.727 --> 23:11.327
A reflection.

23:11.387 --> 23:13.309
This is really shiny, you know?

23:15.550 --> 23:16.691
You could use it as a mirror.

23:17.072 --> 23:20.134
You could, you could.

23:20.174 --> 23:25.038
Ruffians, you all know that today is a very special FUWAMOCO Morning.

23:25.078 --> 23:27.520
Just a bit, right.

23:28.161 --> 23:31.203
After all, you know, it's our 50th episode!

23:31.303 --> 23:35.787
Yeah, and you know it's a very special morning show to all of us.

23:37.660 --> 23:47.510
Actually, we received some cute video messages from all of our fans!

23:47.530 --> 23:48.651
BAU BAU!

23:48.772 --> 23:49.612
Let's check them out!

23:49.632 --> 23:51.615
Is it okay?

23:54.477 --> 23:55.178
Who's first?

23:56.119 --> 23:56.500
Let's see!

24:01.633 --> 24:03.233
Good morning, FUWAMOCO.

24:03.534 --> 24:05.814
Oh man, I probably just woke up for this.

24:05.914 --> 24:08.995
FUWAMOCO Mornings.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.276
Oh good golly, I don't know how you guys do it.

24:11.876 --> 24:13.036
Waking up that early.

24:13.397 --> 24:14.677
Oh my good lord.

24:14.697 --> 24:17.438
But, but, I'm super proud of you.

24:17.458 --> 24:21.319
Congrats on reaching your 50th FUWAMOCO Morning.

24:21.339 --> 24:23.840
You guys are fantastic.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.381
Genmates, I'm super happy to have you.

24:26.641 --> 24:27.181
Out of jail.

24:28.642 --> 24:30.343
Out of jail, walking the park.

24:30.683 --> 24:34.346
Even though you guys keep chasing the mailman who just tries to deliver us our crap.

24:34.826 --> 24:37.829
Thank you for being really kind to us.

24:38.369 --> 24:39.730
And you guys are super sweet.

24:39.910 --> 24:43.053
Oh, by the way, thanks for introducing me to ponderings.

24:43.493 --> 24:44.834
Oh man, those are pretty yummy.

24:46.215 --> 24:48.096
I don't think mine are legit ponderings.

24:48.136 --> 24:48.616
I don't know.

24:48.776 --> 24:50.297
Mine go like hard.

24:50.317 --> 24:51.878
They go hardcore.

24:52.138 --> 24:53.559
Like cobra hardcore.

24:53.679 --> 24:54.859
After like a few days.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.181
Or maybe it's my fault because I don't eat them in time.

24:57.221 --> 24:59.021
Why are you letting them sit for a few days?

24:59.102 --> 24:59.622
Yeah, ponderings?

24:59.642 --> 25:01.383
Super yummy.

25:01.683 --> 25:05.305
I hope that you guys will be able to get more rest.

25:05.645 --> 25:07.486
I'm watching you.

25:08.546 --> 25:11.348
And I look forward to seeing more FUWAMOCO Mornings.

25:12.422 --> 25:22.853
I don't know about you, but I prefer sleeping in until 1pm or something.

25:23.034 --> 25:24.475
However, I'm getting a little bit better.

25:24.735 --> 25:25.937
I'm getting a little bit better.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.099
I'm waking up before 12pm now.

25:28.119 --> 25:29.100
Yeah, that's right.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.562
Shiori, oh no.

25:30.922 --> 25:32.384
She's becoming a morning person.

25:34.026 --> 25:34.726
But, but, but.

25:35.027 --> 25:36.308
Make sure to take care of yourself.

25:36.449 --> 25:37.310
Eat your breakfast.

25:37.330 --> 25:38.752
Take care of your voice.

25:38.772 --> 25:46.241
Make sure to do doggy stuff like doggy walks and doggy paddle and doggy biting the mailman's butt.

25:46.381 --> 25:47.062
Shiori!

25:47.563 --> 25:47.783
BAU BAU!

25:53.942 --> 25:56.084
BAU BAU!

25:56.184 --> 25:57.405
Shiori.

25:58.206 --> 25:59.927
Shiori's so sweet.

26:00.168 --> 26:01.909
Not as sweet as Pondering, though.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.071
I'm not gonna lie.

26:04.111 --> 26:05.553
Not as sweet as Pondering.

26:06.013 --> 26:08.075
Yeah, I wanna eat Shiori.

26:08.235 --> 26:08.956
I wanna eat Pondering.

26:08.996 --> 26:09.616
Not Shiori.

26:14.469 --> 26:16.070
Pondering with Shiori!

26:16.210 --> 26:17.971
Pondering with Shiori.

26:18.412 --> 26:21.413
No cannibalism, that's on Friday.

26:21.433 --> 26:23.595
That's not this day, no.

26:23.795 --> 26:26.016
Today's Wednesday!

26:27.177 --> 26:32.040
But you know what?

26:32.100 --> 26:37.623
Sometimes after FUWAMOCO Morning, Shiori will message me and be like, good job, FUWAMOCO Morning!

26:37.803 --> 26:38.264
It's very cute.

26:40.545 --> 26:43.488
I wonder on those days, is Shiori just waking up?

26:43.809 --> 26:45.070
Or is she just sleeping?

26:46.932 --> 26:52.918
I imagine if she's in bed and she's like, Oh, it's FUWAMOCO Morning!

26:52.978 --> 26:55.240
Maybe there's a lot of ruffians too!

26:55.261 --> 26:55.661
Yeah, yeah.

26:55.961 --> 26:56.962
That's what I imagine.

26:57.022 --> 26:58.264
Thank you, Shiori!

26:58.304 --> 27:01.207
Thank you, BAU BAU!

27:03.216 --> 27:09.384
We also got some other videos because just Shiori doesn't make all of them, right?

27:09.464 --> 27:15.572
Let's see who we have next!

27:17.200 --> 27:18.902
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.563
I'm Nerissa.

27:21.864 --> 27:26.308
Together we are FUWAMOCO-rissa.

27:27.849 --> 27:32.152
Jokes aside, congratulations FUWAMOCO for your

27:33.173 --> 27:36.456
50th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:36.596 --> 27:42.922
That is such an amazing number to reach for any series, especially long running, and something you started from debut.

27:43.282 --> 27:56.974
I'm so, so proud of you guys for starting this, for keeping it going for so long, and for helping Ruffians and other hololive fans have such wonderful mornings, being able to spend them with the two most adorable puppies in hololive English Advent.

27:57.735 --> 28:00.077
But I'm not just here to congratulate you,

28:00.097 --> 28:00.237
BAU!

28:00.297 --> 28:00.537
BAU!

28:18.488 --> 28:21.429
And I was so impressed by your guys' vocals!

28:21.969 --> 28:24.430
I mean, I always am, but I was so impressed.

28:25.930 --> 28:30.612
The high notes were hit so well and you guys just sounded so good together, which is to be expected.

28:32.672 --> 28:41.075
But I'm really proud of you guys and all the progress you've been making on your channel, with your music, everything, everything, everything.

28:41.255 --> 28:43.356
And I hope, I know,

28:44.576 --> 28:50.000
I'm excited and I'm sure the ruffians are as well for everything you guys are going to do in the future.

28:50.440 --> 28:55.243
So congratulations again on your 50th episode and I'll talk to you guys all soon.

28:56.544 --> 29:00.206
Thank you!

29:00.346 --> 29:01.767
Thank you!

29:02.027 --> 29:03.808
We still have a kiss at the end!

29:04.128 --> 29:04.829
That was fun.

29:07.261 --> 29:07.561
For what?

29:07.961 --> 29:08.562
For your tummy?

29:08.582 --> 29:08.622
No!

29:09.142 --> 29:09.663
No!

29:09.683 --> 29:13.805
I don't think it was for the ruffians.

29:13.845 --> 29:14.926
The kiss was for you!

29:14.946 --> 29:14.986
Ha.

29:18.288 --> 29:19.169
Ha.

29:20.470 --> 29:20.770
Ha.

29:22.851 --> 29:23.732
But thank you!

29:23.772 --> 29:25.473
Thank you Abyssgard!

29:25.874 --> 29:33.619
We're really happy to hear that you really like identity and that you like the song Tweets because you know that's always an area of...

29:34.904 --> 29:35.944
FUWAMOCO is FUWAMOCO.

30:03.238 --> 30:06.080
Nerissa, you think too, okay?

30:06.160 --> 30:11.082
If we're gonna do this, you have to pull your weight too.

30:11.102 --> 30:14.204
Start thinking, okay?

30:14.364 --> 30:18.326
Thank you so much, Nerissa!

30:18.426 --> 30:20.627
BAU BAU!

30:20.827 --> 30:26.050
I actually had an idea, but then recently I've been thinking...

30:27.159 --> 30:27.559
No.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.140
Why?

30:29.720 --> 30:30.440
Just cause.

30:30.540 --> 30:31.201
Maybe not.

30:33.181 --> 30:36.322
This is why I said that it's so difficult to choose.

30:36.442 --> 30:37.103
Right?

30:37.423 --> 30:39.804
There must be something better.

30:40.884 --> 30:41.324
Well!

30:42.145 --> 30:43.405
We have another video.

30:43.505 --> 30:43.905
No more.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.346
No more videos.

30:46.706 --> 30:47.466
No!

30:48.107 --> 30:48.347
No!

30:48.367 --> 30:51.968
Advent's not complete without Biboo too!

30:51.988 --> 30:53.829
Can I see a video from Biboo?

31:02.130 --> 31:03.811
BAU BAU!

31:03.851 --> 31:06.593
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

31:06.973 --> 31:07.113
Hi!

31:07.213 --> 31:16.058
It's Biboo, and I would like to congratulate you on your 50th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:16.158 --> 31:18.259
BAU BAU!

31:18.439 --> 31:20.000
Thank you!

31:20.020 --> 31:20.660
50, wow!

31:21.021 --> 31:22.842
Congratulations!

31:24.386 --> 31:39.204
To make your 50th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning more special, I decided to present a special segment today I would like to call Biboo's Meme Corner!

31:42.628 --> 31:43.509
Meme Corner!

31:43.569 --> 31:55.842
Now, recently there's been a meme going around that has now gotten into around hololive because of a certain rock.

31:56.303 --> 32:02.229
And that meme is Gyat for the Rizzler.

32:04.031 --> 32:06.392
There was a recent parody of it.

32:06.992 --> 32:11.453
A certain member may have sang a hololive version of it.

32:11.953 --> 32:17.155
And FUWAMOCO said... It's cute!

32:17.915 --> 32:18.695
BAU BAU.

32:19.135 --> 32:22.396
We don't understand the joke, but that's okay.

32:22.476 --> 32:24.076
Yeah, that's okay!

32:24.257 --> 32:29.638
Because I'm going to explain you the song.

32:29.658 --> 32:32.539
So, the first line of the song.

32:34.377 --> 32:37.880
Sticking out your gyat for Nerissa.

32:38.060 --> 32:39.220
What does that mean?

32:39.260 --> 32:43.644
The original is sticking out your gyat for the Rizzler.

32:44.204 --> 32:46.686
The Rizzler is someone with Riz.

32:46.886 --> 32:48.247
Someone with Rizla.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.529
So obviously that is Nerissa.

32:50.909 --> 32:55.412
And sticking out your gyat is basically sticking out your butt.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.574
So you are sticking out your butt.

32:58.254 --> 32:58.874
For Nerissa.

32:59.034 --> 32:59.774
Okay, moving on.

33:00.094 --> 33:01.975
I'll pass on that, thank you.

33:02.735 --> 33:05.615
You're so BAU BAU.

33:05.675 --> 33:06.176
BAU BAU!

33:06.196 --> 33:09.556
The original one is You're So Skibbity.

33:10.616 --> 33:14.957
Skibbity is a popular song, but it's just fun to sing.

33:15.277 --> 33:16.597
And you know what else is fun to say?

33:16.617 --> 33:17.258
BAU BAU?

33:17.538 --> 33:18.358
BAU BAU.

33:18.398 --> 33:18.918
Thank you!

33:19.918 --> 33:20.738
They're both catchy.

33:21.278 --> 33:22.499
Don't you so skibbity?

33:23.099 --> 33:23.999
You're so BAU BAU.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.131
I think BAU BAU is just much better.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.838
You're so bibutax.

33:33.378 --> 33:33.798
Why?

33:34.539 --> 33:38.561
I still don't know what this means, but bibutax.

33:38.841 --> 33:46.125
Let's say bibutax is you are exchanging a little bit of your sanity while watching me.

33:46.966 --> 33:51.268
Yes, in exchange for watching bibu, you exchange some of your sanity.

33:51.449 --> 33:53.230
I never feel like that.

33:53.290 --> 33:54.630
Maybe I lost all my sanity.

33:56.571 --> 33:58.712
I just wanna be your Shiori.

33:59.192 --> 34:02.993
Now, the original is I wanna be your Sigma.

34:03.053 --> 34:05.774
And Sigma is like a macho person.

34:06.274 --> 34:09.915
And Shiori is like the best.

34:10.555 --> 34:10.715
Right?

34:10.835 --> 34:13.996
Everyone wants to be Shiori because she's so cool.

34:14.276 --> 34:16.616
So that's basically it.

34:17.237 --> 34:18.237
That's basically it.

34:20.247 --> 34:20.847
You understand?

34:20.867 --> 34:20.907
No.

34:21.347 --> 34:22.988
You understand the meme?

34:24.148 --> 34:24.648
Not at all.

34:24.708 --> 34:25.849
You understand now?

34:25.869 --> 34:25.909
No.

34:26.769 --> 34:28.329
I like the you're so BAU BAU part.

34:28.349 --> 34:28.709
BAU BAU.

34:28.749 --> 34:30.190
Maybe you don't, but that's okay.

34:30.390 --> 34:40.753
Because the whole part of what makes the meme the meme is that no one can understand what the beep anyone is talking about.

34:42.665 --> 34:43.585
Done!

34:45.086 --> 34:46.267
I hope that clears it up.

34:46.887 --> 34:49.168
Thank you for coming to Biboo's Meme Corner.

34:49.208 --> 34:55.150
I hope you learned something today and BAU BAU!

34:55.190 --> 34:55.911
BAU BAU!

34:55.931 --> 35:01.213
BAU BAU!

35:01.293 --> 35:02.994
Did we learn something, Ruffians?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.782
I like that you're so BAU BAU for it.

35:06.202 --> 35:07.463
You're so BAU BAU.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.003
BAU BAU.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.043
You learned so much.

35:09.823 --> 35:13.044
I learned that maybe we don't need our sanity anymore.

35:13.444 --> 35:20.345
Because apparently, you lose sanity watching people, and apparently you didn't need any anyways to learn that.

35:21.746 --> 35:22.206
Right!

35:22.506 --> 35:23.326
What's the point?

35:25.026 --> 35:27.007
The point is for you not to understand.

35:27.027 --> 35:31.067
Don't think just

35:34.386 --> 35:36.366
Just Biboo.

35:36.446 --> 35:37.427
BAU BAU!

35:37.467 --> 35:42.428
Thank you, Biboo!

35:42.808 --> 35:47.169
You can always count on Biboo for being... Even though she's a rock, you know?

35:47.189 --> 35:48.349
She's up to deep.

35:48.749 --> 35:49.329
Up to deep.

35:49.389 --> 35:49.909
No nose.

35:50.209 --> 35:52.250
What is that?

35:52.310 --> 35:52.590
No nose.

35:52.750 --> 35:53.710
No, she has a nose.

35:54.190 --> 35:58.311
She knows what the heart thing is.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.391
You know?

35:59.651 --> 36:01.272
The finger on the pulse.

36:01.812 --> 36:02.232
Yeah.

36:03.143 --> 36:09.431
Thank you Biboo for doing your best to teach us about the new things.

36:10.332 --> 36:12.454
BAU BAU!

36:12.695 --> 36:15.198
Thank you so much Advent!

36:15.278 --> 36:17.160
We're so lucky.

36:19.142 --> 36:20.543
Yeah, it means so much to us.

36:20.603 --> 36:21.643
Right, you know?

36:21.863 --> 36:22.803
All your videos.

36:22.883 --> 36:24.584
Thank you!

36:24.644 --> 36:25.264
Thank you!

36:25.624 --> 36:32.667
We know, you know, that Advent, they've really helped us out a lot while, you know, we struggled through things these past four months, you know?

36:33.087 --> 36:37.628
Especially with our worries often about FUWAMOCO Morning.

36:37.728 --> 36:47.092
You know, we've talked about it before, but even though it might not look like it, there's actually a lot of work that goes into each episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

36:48.193 --> 36:55.734
You know we wake up at 5am for it and some days we weren't able to wake up for it because we were working through the night.

36:58.232 --> 37:07.357
There's definitely been times where we felt very not good, a bit unwell, and like, I just can't do it today, you know?

37:07.377 --> 37:18.703
We're not able to do it, but we've pulled through because we know that you'll be pulling yourself out of bed, and you're looking forward to seeing us before you go off on your day too, right?

37:20.367 --> 37:30.914
You know, we want to make sure that you're going to be on the right paw with a smile on your face and we hope that maybe we can make the day just a bit brighter for you too.

37:30.934 --> 37:31.435
Just a bit.

37:32.195 --> 37:36.358
So, no matter how rough it is, we continue on!

37:36.478 --> 37:37.299
Continue!

37:37.599 --> 37:41.222
Even though there are times where we feel like we just can't do it too.

37:41.262 --> 37:49.928
You know, there's been numerous times where we've even talked between the two of us about maybe ending FUWAMOCO Morning

37:51.004 --> 38:01.026
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for waking up with us three times a week and being here to support us.

38:01.086 --> 38:05.107
It really, really does mean the world to us.

38:05.568 --> 38:11.549
But if somehow the day comes where we have to put a pause on FUWAMOCO Morning,

38:12.188 --> 38:16.510
Please understand that it was not a decision made lightly at all.

38:16.930 --> 38:20.772
There were many tears involved too, so... Thank you, Ruffians!

38:21.033 --> 38:24.834
Thank you for 50 episodes!

38:25.175 --> 38:26.275
And many more to come!

38:26.615 --> 38:27.256
BAU BAU!

38:27.316 --> 38:29.457
Thank you!

38:29.477 --> 38:30.677
Thank you!

38:30.697 --> 38:39.602
FUWAMOCO-chan, you know we receive so much strength and power and support from the Ruffians all the time, right?

38:39.942 --> 38:40.302
I do.

38:40.562 --> 38:41.723
Do you think that

38:42.173 --> 38:45.776
Maybe you can give the ruffians some of that power back too?

38:47.438 --> 38:48.459
Would you like that?

38:50.781 --> 38:52.422
Well maybe if you don't even like it.

38:54.284 --> 38:54.704
I don't know.

39:02.011 --> 39:03.052
Even if you don't like it.

39:04.113 --> 39:06.235
I wanted to tell you something today!

39:08.829 --> 39:12.750
It's straight from my heart, so... You better listen up, okay?

39:12.770 --> 39:15.371
Do you know what time it is?

39:15.391 --> 39:17.212
Do you know what this is?

39:18.392 --> 39:21.634
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

39:22.154 --> 39:24.755
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

39:26.015 --> 39:26.375
Yo!

39:27.236 --> 39:28.176
Ruffians!

39:29.976 --> 39:31.217
I know it's rough sometimes.

39:32.317 --> 39:34.378
I know it's hard to keep going.

39:35.819 --> 39:36.579
Sometimes...

39:37.679 --> 39:41.781
You just want to sleep without the weight of knowing when you need to get up and get going.

39:42.762 --> 39:46.344
But, despite all that, you're doing it!

39:47.085 --> 39:48.746
You managed to keep going!

39:49.526 --> 39:53.008
You keep bringing your absolute best to each and every day!

39:53.028 --> 40:01.373
You know, not every day will be as good as the last, but what I can promise is that you'll make it through.

40:02.153 --> 40:02.974
You'll make through it!

40:04.907 --> 40:09.032
Now, we're already at almost the end of the year!

40:09.373 --> 40:10.474
We're almost there!

40:11.215 --> 40:16.041
In the blink of an eye, 2023 has gone by this fast!

40:17.222 --> 40:24.411
I know that things haven't gone exactly as you planned or hoped, but you've done amazing.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.953
Don't focus on what didn't happen or what you didn't do.

40:29.573 --> 40:32.436
And think about all the things that you did do, okay?

40:32.917 --> 40:33.918
What you accomplished.

40:34.459 --> 40:36.140
What you challenged yourself to.

40:36.621 --> 40:40.285
What you're still challenging yourself to, bit by bit, every day.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.346
Okay?

40:42.567 --> 40:44.589
I'm not lying when I say that you're amazing.

40:45.530 --> 40:45.851
Okay?

40:47.910 --> 40:50.631
I believe in you, so you should do okay!

40:52.492 --> 40:54.252
It's all gonna be okay!

40:54.833 --> 40:55.953
Let's work hard together.

40:56.733 --> 40:57.133
Got it.

40:59.054 --> 41:02.175
Ganbatte de!

41:02.195 --> 41:02.515
BAU BAU!

41:04.491 --> 41:06.912
BAU BAU!

41:07.632 --> 41:10.974
Let's do our best, okay, ruffians?

41:11.394 --> 41:19.638
At FUWAMOCO, we'll continue to do our best on every each next episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

41:20.038 --> 41:22.479
Thank you!

41:22.559 --> 41:26.541
FUWAMOCO-chan, do we have a Doggie of the Day for today?

41:26.561 --> 41:27.322
We do!

41:28.798 --> 41:32.999
The Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

41:33.320 --> 41:35.140
Haku!

41:35.180 --> 41:36.340
That's a cute name.

41:36.581 --> 41:37.641
Why?

41:38.201 --> 41:39.762
Very, very cute.

41:40.322 --> 41:44.003
Haku is a quiet dog like us two, but he looks...

41:44.543 --> 41:44.904
I know.

41:45.444 --> 41:47.086
He looks kinda like us too, no?

41:47.106 --> 41:48.088
Kinda like us.

41:48.388 --> 41:51.071
A little bit more snow-colored than Rai.

41:51.091 --> 41:53.995
Yeah, a little bit more caramel-y in comparison, I think.

41:54.756 --> 41:58.580
But even though he's a good dog, he's a super softy too.

41:58.620 --> 41:59.862
Yeah, me BUBUBU.

42:00.923 --> 42:02.164
I don't think we're BUBUBU.

42:02.805 --> 42:03.966
Why not boop boop boop?

42:04.006 --> 42:06.307
Don't boop us, okay?

42:06.347 --> 42:10.770
Yeah, but you know, we're not scared to get mean if those who are important to us are in danger.

42:11.390 --> 42:13.171
Especially your smile.

42:13.211 --> 42:15.193
You should know that by now.

42:15.353 --> 42:18.535
But, you know, Haku looks very serious here.

42:19.095 --> 42:21.576
Maybe a seriously silly Haku.

42:22.557 --> 42:24.718
I wonder what happens if I touch the nose.

42:26.039 --> 42:28.180
I don't know.

42:28.321 --> 42:29.901
Let's maybe go find out, Moco-chan.

42:31.649 --> 42:34.572
How does Haku BAU BAU?

42:34.832 --> 42:38.695
Maybe a bit scary, a bit rough like a BAU!

42:38.755 --> 42:38.875
BAU!

42:39.276 --> 42:39.476
BAU!

42:39.516 --> 42:39.696
BAU!

42:40.197 --> 42:40.657

42:40.697 --> 42:40.857

Good buddy.

43:00.394 --> 43:00.774
BAU BAU!

43:01.315 --> 43:03.236
And for today, I went on a walk.

43:03.296 --> 43:05.358
Where did we go on a walk to?

43:05.418 --> 43:06.439
We have the...

43:22.956 --> 43:26.339
Maybe we're looking at the same moon.

43:38.832 --> 43:41.594
Well, Northwest Passage is a bit different, so maybe not.

43:41.634 --> 43:43.575
Maybe not, but I wanna believe that!

43:43.635 --> 43:44.155
Yeah!

43:44.195 --> 43:45.656
Let's believe that, okay?

43:46.217 --> 43:48.318
This is why morning walks are so nice.

43:48.338 --> 43:48.458
Yeah!

43:48.498 --> 43:49.639
Story notes!

43:49.739 --> 43:51.380
It's so crisp and peaceful.

43:51.420 --> 43:51.900
Quiet.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.501
The world's just waking up.

43:53.521 --> 43:53.921
Quiet.

43:54.222 --> 43:55.342
Everything is shining.

43:55.422 --> 43:55.843
Quiet.

43:57.903 --> 44:01.624
And anything is possible for you to accomplish with the rest of your day, right?

44:01.664 --> 44:06.025
We hope it gave you a good boost of energy for the morning.

44:06.105 --> 44:08.345
BAU BAU!

44:08.945 --> 44:10.606
I want to use that as a wallpaper.

44:10.646 --> 44:11.546
I know, right?

44:11.566 --> 44:12.706
I like the color.

44:12.786 --> 44:14.066
It's like ice cream.

44:15.666 --> 44:17.227
I want to eat the ice cream sky.

44:17.647 --> 44:18.407
Ice cream sky.

44:18.927 --> 44:24.088
Well, for the question of the day today, we have... De-den!

44:26.229 --> 44:27.710
Hello FUWAMOCO!

44:46.306 --> 44:48.830
Well, there are a lot of things that can brighten up our day.

44:48.890 --> 44:55.140
You know, nice weather, good cup of tea, restful sleep, doing stretches, good walks.

44:55.180 --> 44:56.582
You know, lots of stuff.

44:57.283 --> 44:57.603
But!

44:58.745 --> 44:59.006
But!

45:00.049 --> 45:04.772
The best is seeing special comments and sweet messages left by the ruffians!

45:04.952 --> 45:07.533
Especially on things that we worked really hard on.

45:07.933 --> 45:12.516
And just ruffians being silly and kind all together!

45:12.616 --> 45:17.458
You know, we saw a ruffian that was having a bit of a bad day on Twitter the other day.

45:19.219 --> 45:24.865
There were a bunch of ruffians all there with some genuine and really comforting words for them.

45:25.065 --> 45:27.608
It made us really happy to see that.

45:27.968 --> 45:30.511
Ruffians, you really are wonderful.

45:30.831 --> 45:33.334
We're really lucky, Moco-chan.

45:34.135 --> 45:38.199
We really hope that you can come together as a warm community of friends.

45:39.080 --> 45:41.802
Even make amazing things happen, ruffians, you know.

45:42.062 --> 45:43.904
We know that you're super creative.

45:44.204 --> 45:45.586
Especially when you're crazy.

45:46.446 --> 45:49.229
You know, when you're passionate about something.

45:50.530 --> 45:55.915
I guess the short answer is the kind words and actions that we see from the ruffians.

45:56.355 --> 45:57.897
That's what really brightens up our days.

45:58.874 --> 46:00.695
Thank you, Ruffians!

46:00.875 --> 46:01.695
BAU BAU!

46:02.136 --> 46:03.136
Thank you!

46:03.216 --> 46:06.138
Thank you so much for all of your submissions today!

46:06.158 --> 46:11.200
And for all of your submissions up until now, Ruffians!

46:11.240 --> 46:15.763
Including the ones that still have yet to be featured, too!

46:16.043 --> 46:21.586
And please remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together with you, Ruffians!

46:22.586 --> 46:25.028
We're looking for more Doggie of the Day.

46:25.068 --> 46:26.949
Maybe you see a really fluffy dog.

46:27.410 --> 46:27.870
I know.

46:28.110 --> 46:29.571
Or maybe a dog with no fur.

46:29.932 --> 46:30.672
Oh, maybe.

46:30.832 --> 46:31.132
No.

46:31.473 --> 46:34.415
But I'm sure maybe you're going on a few walks here and there.

46:34.455 --> 46:37.137
Show us what you thought was cool, you know?

46:37.537 --> 46:39.178
And questions, questions.

46:39.238 --> 46:40.880
I know you have questions.

46:40.980 --> 46:43.081
As well as... We maybe have answers.

46:43.161 --> 46:44.863
We have times that you see Pero too.

46:45.683 --> 46:52.584
So please, please let us know and use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

46:52.644 --> 46:54.905
BAU BAU!

46:55.005 --> 46:56.385
Thank you, ruffians!

46:56.425 --> 46:57.385
Thank you!

46:58.866 --> 47:04.627
For our next stream, we actually have something a bit different.

47:04.687 --> 47:05.027
Yeah.

47:05.827 --> 47:14.889
Well, we won't be having a stream tonight, but we will be making our first appearance on the official hololive English channel with

47:15.563 --> 47:23.387
Very special announcement about the recent hololive English concert, Connect the World!

47:23.467 --> 47:30.651
It premieres at 6.20pm PT or 11.20am GST, so please check it out!

47:31.752 --> 47:36.214
Also, there will be a special announcement too, so please be there!

47:36.274 --> 47:37.615

47:38.716 --> 47:39.956

47:40.277 --> 47:41.977

47:43.378 --> 47:44.439
My eyes are so shiny.

47:44.499 --> 47:45.760
That's what actually happened.

47:46.060 --> 47:46.741
BAU BAU!

47:47.141 --> 47:54.146
And for our next stream, we have FUWAMOCO Morning 51!

47:54.306 --> 48:01.112
FUWAMOCO Morning continues on, so we hope that you'll be there on Friday with us.

48:01.432 --> 48:02.973
And if we take a little peek at the schedule too,

48:05.063 --> 48:05.663
Llamas.

48:25.336 --> 48:25.997
Something like that.

48:26.238 --> 48:26.518
Yeah.

48:26.659 --> 48:27.420
Limes are cute.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.322
Yeah.

48:28.342 --> 48:29.764
Definitely no cannibalism.

48:30.185 --> 48:31.868
Let's hope the movie goes well!

48:46.268 --> 48:47.668

48:49.489 --> 48:55.332
Thank you again, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 50th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

48:55.852 --> 49:00.774
It really means so much to us that you want to start out your day together with us!

49:01.554 --> 49:03.294
Thank you, Ruffians.

49:03.474 --> 49:09.695
We hope that you'll continue to want to be here with us for many, many more mornings to come.
