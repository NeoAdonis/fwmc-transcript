00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.853
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.264
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:20.085
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:24.907
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:27.690
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.912
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:32.555
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:37.681
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.122
BAU BAU!

00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:48.154
BAU BAU, thank you for joining us, Ruffians, for our This is Now We're in the Territory of Fuwawa's Struggles with the Epics and Memories.

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:50.316
We're in our 102nd episode!

00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:51.137
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:57.505
For a second there, I thought you were gonna forget who the hosts are.

00:05:58.751 --> 00:05:59.452
BAU BAU!

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:17.417
Wow, Ruffians!

00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:20.199
Don't forget who the hosts are.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.802
But there might be some Ruffians who don't know who the hosts are.

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:23.922
Right!

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:34.612
So, for those who are joining us today for the very first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:36.614
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.617
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:40.297 --> 00:06:45.542
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:45.883
Hi!

00:06:45.963 --> 00:06:51.168
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:55.432
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:57.695
BAU BAU!

00:06:57.715 --> 00:06:59.196
Ruffians.

00:06:59.316 --> 00:06:59.637
Huh?

00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:01.759
Doesn't feel like it's been a while.

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:05.562
It has been a while.

00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:06.543
It's been a while, huh?

00:07:06.603 --> 00:07:08.624
It's been about two weeks, huh?

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:09.605
Two weeks?

00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:15.610
It feels like it has been!

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.951
It's been 48 hours!

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:18.132
A.K.A.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:18.752
two weeks.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:20.394
BAU BAU!

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:27.819
We're so happy to be able to spend this morning together with you, Ruffians!

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.242
Because it's gonna be a very exciting day today!

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:34.406
It's gonna be an adventure, huh?

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:34.986
Yeah!

00:07:36.008 --> 00:07:39.913
Moco-chan, let's see how today's day starts out.

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:48.284
Well... I hate to break it to you, but I... There's a Perroccino.

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:54.817
Moco-chan, you know how sometimes there's like really bad Pero Sightings?

00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:57.858
And there's Pero Sightings where it's like, oh that's unfortunate.

00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.479
Which one is it today?

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.481
Well, let's check!

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:03.522
De-den!

00:08:04.122 --> 00:08:08.145
What?

00:08:08.205 --> 00:08:08.325
Hi!

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:10.566
You're a baby!

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:11.687
Blondie!

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:13.308
Tiny little ears there!

00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:15.189
Do you see?

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:16.009
I see.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.470
Not Pero.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.730
I see cat.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.251
No.

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:18.711
No Pero.

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:22.599
Your body is so cute!

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:23.419
Right!

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:25.400
Orange cat!

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.380
But, but!

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.861
Body should not be making friends with Peron!

00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:30.121
No.

00:08:30.442 --> 00:08:31.622
No, he's nasty!

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:32.382
No!

00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:33.122
No.

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:36.524
He might have said some nice things to us the other day.

00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:38.924
But, he's no good, okay?

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:40.025
No good.

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:40.305
No.

00:08:42.966 --> 00:08:45.267
He might eat your cat if you're not careful too, okay?

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:48.249
You wouldn't want that, right?

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:50.189
Right!

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:53.151
Would you rather have Pero eat your cat?

00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:55.672
Or us?

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:57.452
Ruffians!

00:08:57.772 --> 00:08:58.333
Which one?

00:08:58.813 --> 00:09:01.194
Pero.

00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:02.694
Or us?

00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:04.435
Neither.

00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:06.976
Are you sure about that?

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:08.637
Neither!

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:09.577
Please!

00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:10.618
Neither?

00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:11.278
No one?

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:15.078
This makes me want to eat blondie more.

00:09:15.098 --> 00:09:15.138
Hi!

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:17.440
Blondie!

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.361
Only Fuwawa?

00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:20.062
Yeah.

00:09:20.362 --> 00:09:22.684
That's what I thought!

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:32.073
Well, you know, we're sure that blondie is super nice and cuddly and a cute cat, so you don't need to be making friends with someone like Pero.

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:38.177
Yeah, maybe, maybe get that car up and running and then take him to a pet shop.

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:39.198
Pet shop!

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:39.839
Yeah.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:43.881
There should be lots of other cats he can become friends with.

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:44.402
Right.

00:09:44.422 --> 00:09:45.743
Blondie's not in trouble.

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:47.184
Yeah.

00:09:47.564 --> 00:09:48.605
Forget Pero, okay?

00:09:48.905 --> 00:09:49.805
Forget him.

00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:53.228
Yeah, go have a fun time with your little doofus, okay?

00:09:53.248 --> 00:09:53.908
A doofus?

00:09:53.948 --> 00:09:54.629
Yeah.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:55.169
Doofus.

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:56.490
Little orange doofus.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:10.056
BAU BAU!

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:16.640
It's been a very busy week for FUWAMOCO, but today!

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.822
Today, we got through a rough day today.

00:10:19.842 --> 00:10:24.905
A rough day at the end of a very, very busy week.

00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:28.096
Ruffians.

00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:29.717
BAU BAU.

00:10:30.277 --> 00:10:33.460
It really started off on the wrong paw for us.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah.

00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.524
You know, Fuwawa was running behind like crazy.

00:10:38.924 --> 00:10:42.287
She's just running behind a bit, but like crazy this time.

00:10:42.807 --> 00:10:47.210
And was just getting dressed about 10 minutes before we had to be out the door.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.154
I was running around trying to find all my clothes.

00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:53.935
I couldn't find them, Ruffians!

00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:54.516
And then,

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:56.717
I just made it in time though!

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.078
And then Moco-chan here!

00:10:59.098 --> 00:11:02.360
I thought I had our umbrellas packed with me!

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.182
But they had me as Moco-chan taking them out of my bag!

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:11.064
I shouldn't think it was raining, even though you know from the very moment we woke up, it was raining!

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:13.085
I didn't take it out of the bag, okay?

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:14.046
It wasn't in there.

00:11:14.146 --> 00:11:14.986
I didn't take them out.

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.147
It must have been you, Moco-chan!

00:11:16.187 --> 00:11:18.088
They were just, they were on the floor.

00:11:18.108 --> 00:11:19.628
They were always in my bag!

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:21.589
I'm the umbrella keeper, right?

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:22.630
I didn't take them out.

00:11:24.153 --> 00:11:27.974
No, but... It wasn't just like raining raining.

00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:31.695
It was pouring dogs and dogs outside, Ruffians.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:32.215
Yeah.

00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:35.276
And then we were also already running late.

00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:39.817
So we just had to dash and hope we didn't get too rained on.

00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:45.158
But... In the end, we did quite a bit.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:48.879
And, you know... I had clothes.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.220
White clothing.

00:11:52.734 --> 00:11:54.675
It was a little embarrassing.

00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:55.456
You know?

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:59.538
And then we were all frazzled because we thought we were gonna be late.

00:11:59.858 --> 00:12:04.221
So then we told Mane-chan, Sorry we're gonna be late!

00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:04.821
I'm so sorry!

00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.884
And then... We showed up right on time.

00:12:09.484 --> 00:12:11.565
Which then caught Mane-chan a bit off guard.

00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:12.186
Right?

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:18.169
Mane-chan, she was like, FUWAMOCO, you said you're gonna be late!

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.291
You know, we're always early!

00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:24.219
You know, if we're not early then we start to panic a bit.

00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:24.619
Why?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.240
Why did I even bother?

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.501
I should just go back home!

00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.601
I should just go home if I'm very late!

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:31.482
Yeah.

00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:37.025
And, to top it off, I had a really pounding headache.

00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:43.647
So then, Fuwawa had to explain things to me and Dog because I wasn't understanding things anymore.

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:45.028
BAU BAU BAU BAU.

00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:45.488
Yeah.

00:12:45.528 --> 00:12:50.270
You know, I think Maritel could tell that we're very off on the road.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.484
But... But!

00:12:57.065 --> 00:13:02.236
The good news is that we got to the next place we had to be at early!

00:13:04.198 --> 00:13:06.299
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:07.339
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:27.626 --> 00:13:36.094
Although, Fuwawa then tried to leave the building we were in through an entrance into another business's office there.

00:13:47.236 --> 00:13:47.596
I don't know.

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:51.037
It's just... I was ready to go home, Ruffians.

00:13:51.117 --> 00:13:53.498
You'll just go into another business!

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:57.739
That was the door in front of me, so... I don't know how you thought that was the exit!

00:13:57.859 --> 00:13:59.959
It looked like an exit.

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:01.019
I don't know.

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.140
I'm glad Moco-chan you're with me, though.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.980
We were supposed to go up a staircase.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.701
I forgot that part.

00:14:09.174 --> 00:14:12.396
Sometimes it's good to have a twin sister, Ruffians.

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:30.730
Now, we know FUWAMOCO's day started off on the wrong paw, but it ended up being on the right one!

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.174
So that means Ruffians, it's going to continue on the right paw for you!

00:14:35.194 --> 00:14:42.662
No matter how unlucky or maybe rough it's going for you, we know that it'll be all okay!

00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:43.783
Because FUWAMOCO!

00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:53.032
On top of that, a very exciting weekend is waiting for all of us Ruffians!

00:14:53.473 --> 00:14:55.635
So hang in there!

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:57.777
BAU BAU!

00:15:08.864 --> 00:15:13.628
BAU BAU!

00:15:13.648 --> 00:15:17.552
Do your best, okay, Ruffians?

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:25.138
As you know, Ruffians, recently we've been doing some trading in Minecraft.

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:25.879
A lot, a lot.

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:27.280
Can you say a lot?

00:15:28.348 --> 00:15:29.188
FUWAMOCO Place.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.141
Wait, what's a better word?

00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:52.922
Doghouse.

00:15:52.962 --> 00:15:53.783
Doghouse.

00:15:53.823 --> 00:15:57.645
Maybe that's a bit confusing with a real doghouse.

00:15:57.725 --> 00:15:58.425
A cube.

00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:00.327
FUWAMOCO Whole.

00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:01.667
FUWAMOCO Hot.

00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:02.648
Headquarters.

00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:03.869
Dog Pound.

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:05.490
FUWAMOCO Shack.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.171
I kind of like the FUWAMOCO Shack.

00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:09.272
That sounds weird to me.

00:16:10.713 --> 00:16:11.794
Tofu House.

00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:12.654
Why?

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:13.775
Hideout.

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:14.915
A FUWAMOCO Hideout.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:15.456
Hideout.

00:16:16.687 --> 00:16:18.448
Oh, FUWAMOCO dog-jo.

00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:19.208
What?

00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:21.289
Like do-jo, but dog-jo.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.951
I was very confused.

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.052
I'm beast.

00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:28.233
Okay.

00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:30.053
Hot!

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:31.654
Anyways.

00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:33.755
I know.

00:16:34.115 --> 00:16:34.335
What?

00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:37.297
We had some good improvements, you know.

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.018
We had some sheep.

00:16:40.118 --> 00:16:41.278
We got more sheep.

00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:44.359
We made the sheep pink.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:48.281
And we also got a cow!

00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:52.122
And guess what we called him.

00:16:53.302 --> 00:16:53.883
Shiori.

00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:56.566
Yeah!

00:16:57.647 --> 00:17:02.391
Shiori, he gives us a lot of milk, which we thought was a handy food, but it wasn't.

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:02.991
No!

00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:05.874
It get rid of the poison, the curses.

00:17:05.914 --> 00:17:06.875
Something we don't really need.

00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:07.255
Yeah.

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:10.137
But we still love Shiori Lawrence, you know.

00:17:10.157 --> 00:17:12.419
His first milk was a special one.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.660
Yeah.

00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:16.863
Do you think we can get more cows, Wolfy?

00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:19.465
I think I got very lucky just helping to find the one cow.

00:17:19.485 --> 00:17:20.366
Yes, his name is Shiori, okay?

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:20.566
Yeah.

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.086
Yeah.

00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:28.736
Yeah, Moco-chan, you know, last time you had the first milk.

00:17:29.296 --> 00:17:30.057
And the second milk.

00:17:30.077 --> 00:17:30.897
I don't think I had any milk.

00:17:30.977 --> 00:17:33.518
It's because I needed it though, because I had the poison.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.020
Yeah, and then the second time we thought it was food, right?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.300
It was a food.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.922
But maybe we can get, we have Shiori 1 right now, right?

00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:45.044
Then we can have Shiori 2, Shiori 3, Shiori 4.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.204
Alright!

00:17:46.444 --> 00:17:49.566
Maybe I can have the first milk of Shiori 4, Moco-chan?

00:17:50.126 --> 00:17:50.526
Yeah.

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:51.987
I don't care, it's not useful.

00:17:52.387 --> 00:17:53.728
I don't care, it's not useful.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:18:11.877
But you know, we're slowly, slowly, slowly but surely, slowly but surely, starting to get the hang of Minecraft with eating food and digging and caves, so please help us to go into Minecraft pros, okay?

00:18:12.637 --> 00:18:14.738
Milk is very important in Minecraft.

00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:15.539
Not yet.

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:16.699
Not yet.

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:17.640
It doesn't do much.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.861
We need food first.

00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:20.701
We're dying.

00:18:20.781 --> 00:18:22.002
Sharing food.

00:18:23.194 --> 00:18:23.835
Sometimes.

00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:26.678
Sometimes.

00:18:26.698 --> 00:18:32.343
But you know, if Final Senpai is a level 10 Minecrafter, we like to aim to be level 4.

00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:35.306
Maybe one day, level 4.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:37.488
Around there.

00:18:40.742 --> 00:18:44.064
BAU BAU!

00:18:44.684 --> 00:18:45.704
I want the chickens.

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:47.005
I want chickens.

00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:48.306
More than Shiori too.

00:18:48.346 --> 00:18:49.286
I want chickens.

00:18:49.646 --> 00:18:52.307
We need the compass.

00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:53.508
Are there chickens?

00:18:54.929 --> 00:18:57.170
Kairai's level 100.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.211
Level 20 Kairai.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:05.413
If we get chickens... Are there crows in Minecraft?

00:19:06.074 --> 00:19:08.455
I need to know this to properly name the chickens.

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:10.031
Chickens.

00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:11.552
Back then.

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:13.053
Maybe.

00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:15.034
No.

00:19:15.394 --> 00:19:16.175
Blue chickens.

00:19:20.517 --> 00:19:25.000
If we have a seaweedy calendar, we have to have a Nerissa chicken, right?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.861
Right?

00:19:25.881 --> 00:19:27.221
You can't die with chickens.

00:19:27.882 --> 00:19:28.642
Why not?

00:19:28.662 --> 00:19:33.185
Can we have chickens in the real world?

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:34.806
Let's not.

00:19:36.096 --> 00:19:38.417
BAU BAU!

00:19:38.517 --> 00:19:39.197
Ruffians!

00:19:40.418 --> 00:19:42.299
Recently... I didn't hear anything.

00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:49.642
Have you noticed that maybe there's been some weird tweets in the FUWAMOCO hashtag, Ruffians?

00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:51.502
Ruffians!

00:19:52.903 --> 00:19:55.184
You aren't up to anything, are you?

00:19:55.984 --> 00:19:57.205
Nothing funny, right?

00:20:01.713 --> 00:20:02.673
Wow!

00:20:03.173 --> 00:20:08.135
Ruffians, there's this tweet that everyone is tweeting and just keeps on repeating.

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:18.197
And it's, Mococo has an innovative solution for keeping her sister out of trouble and out of her way while mining deep underground.

00:20:20.078 --> 00:20:24.399
Is this some kind of magic phrase or something?

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.740
Is it trendy?

00:20:29.636 --> 00:20:30.276
Hi.

00:20:31.256 --> 00:20:32.657
But, Moco-chan!

00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:37.458
Okay, so if you have an innovative solution, what is this then, huh?

00:20:38.139 --> 00:20:39.699
Huh?

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:41.079
What if I don't know?

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:43.140
Keeping your sister out of trouble.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.081
And out of her way?

00:20:45.141 --> 00:20:46.341
What's that part about?

00:20:46.841 --> 00:20:47.221
Huh?

00:20:47.641 --> 00:20:50.762
Who's the one that provides all the food for you at Minecraft, huh?

00:20:51.343 --> 00:20:52.063
At real life.

00:20:53.483 --> 00:20:54.964
At real life, huh?

00:20:55.144 --> 00:20:55.644
Yeah.

00:21:01.707 --> 00:21:02.868
I do important stuff.

00:21:03.348 --> 00:21:04.689
Ruffians!

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:05.910
What about you?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.612
Little bit of solutions.

00:21:10.193 --> 00:21:11.894
I don't know why there's so many people.

00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:12.014
Right!

00:21:12.614 --> 00:21:13.115
Right!

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.496
Are they robots?

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:19.218
Even Ruffians are confused.

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:20.259
Murder.

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:20.900
What?

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.980
What?

00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:22.841
You know.

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:23.962
You plenty solutions?

00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:25.042
Tell us then.

00:21:25.543 --> 00:21:26.743
Make FUWAMOCO like food.

00:21:26.763 --> 00:21:27.504
I've been doing that.

00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:31.646
I don't know!

00:21:31.966 --> 00:21:33.046
I don't know, Ruffians!

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:39.349
I'm not seeing many answers, but I don't think there's any wrong answers when it comes to innovation, you know?

00:21:39.889 --> 00:21:41.950
I guess as long as you're having fun, right?

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.770
Right.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.090
Trap Fuwawa.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.831
Let Fuwawa play Kano, please!

00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:47.772
What?

00:21:48.952 --> 00:21:52.013
It sounded like a ray gun!

00:21:52.033 --> 00:21:55.314
It's a Kano ray gun, okay.

00:21:55.955 --> 00:21:56.355
Yeah.

00:22:00.369 --> 00:22:07.091
But you know, if we know the answer to the innovative solution, then maybe we can get better at Minecraft.

00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.072
Maybe!

00:22:08.832 --> 00:22:09.492
Yeah!

00:22:10.152 --> 00:22:10.593
I don't know.

00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:16.295
We might not ever find out what resonated about this tweet that makes everyone want to copy it.

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:16.895
Right!

00:22:16.975 --> 00:22:23.617
But every time we see it, it always makes us wonder if there are any more innovative solutions out there.

00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:24.377
What are we missing?

00:22:24.717 --> 00:22:25.017
Right?

00:22:25.758 --> 00:22:28.058
There's something amazing waiting and we just don't know.

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:29.219
Mysterious.

00:22:30.393 --> 00:22:33.254
BAU BAU!

00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:34.495
It's bots.

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:38.917
I don't think that's the answer, Ruffians.

00:22:39.717 --> 00:22:41.778
There's something being kept from us.

00:22:42.398 --> 00:22:44.159
We just don't know what makes it special yet.

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:46.460
Maybe it's just trendy, is it the cool thing to do?

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.260
That's right.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.582
FUWAMOCO, we never know the trends or cool things.

00:22:50.962 --> 00:22:51.742
That must be it.

00:22:51.902 --> 00:22:52.643
It must be it.

00:22:54.604 --> 00:22:56.024
There has to be something.

00:22:56.224 --> 00:22:57.285
Secret meaning, huh?

00:22:59.443 --> 00:23:05.028
Well, there's been more confusing stuff happening in Hot Muffins!

00:23:06.209 --> 00:23:15.076
You may know by now, but recently you know we had an off club with Nerissa and Marine Senchou-senpai, right?

00:23:15.717 --> 00:23:18.959
And that was an interesting turn of events.

00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:24.023
You know Nerissa, she ran a pool.

00:23:25.232 --> 00:23:34.961
And apparently, according to that poll, that poll has the Moco-chan as not sexy.

00:23:37.183 --> 00:23:37.963
Ruffians!

00:23:39.925 --> 00:23:41.046
Is this the truth?

00:23:42.648 --> 00:23:46.251
You know, my Agent Joe-senpai laughed really hard.

00:23:46.651 --> 00:23:48.333
She said it so absolutely.

00:23:48.353 --> 00:23:49.514
She did.

00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:56.802
But I'm not... that sexy.

00:23:58.783 --> 00:23:59.523
Really?

00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:03.425
Are you using your eyes?

00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:06.686
Hi?

00:24:07.306 --> 00:24:07.906
Hi!

00:24:09.887 --> 00:24:11.748
Are you using them properly?

00:24:11.768 --> 00:24:11.808
Hi.

00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:18.010
Bibi!

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.130
Well...

00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:23.047
I have a question for you then.

00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:24.708
A couple questions.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.332
Is Korone-senpai not sexy?

00:24:30.953 --> 00:24:33.175
Is Luna-senpai not sexy?

00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:38.138
Is Noel-senpai not sexy?

00:24:41.821 --> 00:24:44.863
Then why am I not sexy then?

00:24:44.923 --> 00:24:45.164
Why?

00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:48.929
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:51.469
Maybe you know, so that you can feel better maybe.

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:58.790
Why don't we run a poll to decide the answer that one's for all?

00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:03.568
Then you don't need to worry about this!

00:25:03.949 --> 00:25:05.471
Don't need to think about it!

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.794
A poll, Ruffians, a poll!

00:25:07.814 --> 00:25:07.854
Huh?!

00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:20.969
Run the poll, Moco-chan!

00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:22.270
Run the poll!

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.671
I don't think I'm ready for that.

00:25:26.412 --> 00:25:27.352
Not ready yet.

00:25:36.197 --> 00:25:37.758
I've already been hurt!

00:25:38.158 --> 00:25:39.079
Okay!

00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:39.919
Nerissa?

00:25:40.659 --> 00:25:48.304
Nerissa?

00:25:48.364 --> 00:25:49.024
Should I take...

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:52.282
Sexy lessons.

00:25:54.203 --> 00:25:58.084
Do it.

00:25:59.665 --> 00:26:02.506
Do it.

00:26:05.487 --> 00:26:09.728
From my sexy teacher!

00:26:10.688 --> 00:26:12.329
Who's the sexy teacher, Moco-chan?

00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:12.829
Ruffians!

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.421
I should be my sexy teacher.

00:26:20.262 --> 00:26:21.063
Why?!

00:26:21.683 --> 00:26:24.585
Nerissa.

00:26:25.005 --> 00:26:25.826
Nerissa.

00:26:26.306 --> 00:26:26.646
You...

00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:26.746
What?!

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.050
Senchou-senpai.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.471
Pero!

00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:35.952
Nerissa volunteers!

00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:36.632
No, Pero.

00:26:36.712 --> 00:26:37.513
I'm ignoring that.

00:26:38.462 --> 00:26:40.124
Pero, not Nerissa?!

00:26:41.044 --> 00:26:45.429
Don't ignore Nerissa!

00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:46.429
Nerissa!

00:26:49.612 --> 00:26:52.075
Nerissa, will you be my sexy teacher?

00:27:00.307 --> 00:27:05.951
Oh my gosh, what if she's like, no, I can't because you have no talent, no future, no hope.

00:27:06.432 --> 00:27:08.794
She said, I'll do anything for Moco-chan.

00:27:10.115 --> 00:27:12.697
You're gonna have your work cut out though, maybe, Nerissa.

00:27:12.877 --> 00:27:14.138
BAU BAU!

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.860
BAU BAU!

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.440
BAU BAU!

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.922
Do you believe in me, Ruffians?

00:27:21.764 --> 00:27:22.364
Might be.

00:27:22.784 --> 00:27:25.527
Is it gonna be like the natto challenge, Moco-chan?

00:27:28.687 --> 00:27:29.147
BAU BAU!

00:27:29.207 --> 00:27:29.668
BAU BAU!

00:27:29.788 --> 00:27:31.809
I don't need lessons so high.

00:27:53.717 --> 00:27:54.858
I don't need lessons though, huh?

00:27:54.918 --> 00:27:56.199
I'm already good, huh?

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:56.979
No.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.760
BAU BAU!

00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:00.322
Ruffians!

00:28:00.382 --> 00:28:01.702
Ruffians!

00:28:02.703 --> 00:28:03.664
I just gotta remind you.

00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:04.164
What?

00:28:04.244 --> 00:28:12.310
In case you forgot, we are officially 12 hours away from the newest hololive English generation!

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.251
Justices debut!

00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:15.772
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:28:17.674 --> 00:28:21.523
Going first here on the very left is justice.

00:28:31.574 --> 00:28:36.576
It's Justice's leader, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.

00:28:36.616 --> 00:28:38.837
The leader is on break time!

00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:39.918
I almost said Bloodflame.

00:28:40.078 --> 00:28:40.518
What?

00:28:40.558 --> 00:28:42.639
Say it again.

00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:45.800
Elizabeth Rose Budflame.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.202
Maybe that's a bit cruel, I don't know.

00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:51.203
Can people say Bloodflame?

00:28:51.323 --> 00:28:53.223
She's gonna be my best Budflame.

00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:54.104
Bloodflame.

00:28:54.204 --> 00:28:54.764
Bloodflame.

00:28:58.641 --> 00:29:03.582
But, you know, I'm a little nervous because

00:29:22.609 --> 00:29:27.930
You know, I'm excited also maybe to get to see more of her relaxed sides, you know?

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.171
She'll definitely share some of her favorite anime and games with us, right?

00:29:32.211 --> 00:29:32.631
Right!

00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:36.252
So there's nothing to be scared of.

00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:36.312
No.

00:29:36.672 --> 00:29:37.612
Right?

00:29:37.712 --> 00:29:39.613
Yeah, I'm not scared of the butt flame.

00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:40.593
Yeah, we're good puppies.

00:29:40.833 --> 00:29:41.493
It's okay.

00:29:41.773 --> 00:29:42.733
Yeah.

00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.394
Nothing to worry about, right?

00:29:45.194 --> 00:29:47.735
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:29:48.115 --> 00:29:51.596
What do we think Elizabeth's favorite anime is?

00:29:56.777 --> 00:29:58.058
I want to say Blood Plus.

00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:01.799
Because of the blood flame?

00:30:01.819 --> 00:30:03.259
Because of the blood flame!

00:30:03.699 --> 00:30:05.499
Blood Plus.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.640
Cold Geass.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.321
That's a good one.

00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:10.861
Maybe Cold Geass.

00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:16.521
Well, after her, we have Gigi Grumlin!

00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:19.464
Justice is Grumlin!

00:30:19.665 --> 00:30:22.407
How do you think Gigi's gonna... She's a grumlin, right?

00:30:22.427 --> 00:30:24.229
She has to make grumlin noises, right?

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:27.032
Maybe like Gigi Gigi Gigi Gigi?

00:30:27.112 --> 00:30:30.275
I feel like that sounds like her laugh.

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:33.238
Gigi Gigi Gigi Gigi!

00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:35.260
I don't know, I feel like...

00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:41.477
If there's gonna be any funny business, it happens after the debuts.

00:30:42.317 --> 00:30:45.460
You know, she's gonna be the one to be the instigator, huh?

00:30:46.622 --> 00:30:48.163
You know she's a gremlin after all!

00:30:52.287 --> 00:30:55.108
I don't know, what about Gigi's favorite anime though?

00:30:55.148 --> 00:30:56.908
Let's forget those things.

00:30:57.328 --> 00:30:59.128
Think about the fun, exciting things.

00:30:59.689 --> 00:31:00.389
Cold Geass.

00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:03.929
Because it starts with a G. I can't say Cold Geass again!

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.610
Monogatari, that's a good one!

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.910
It doesn't start with a G, okay!

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.711
There's a G in it, that's okay.

00:31:08.751 --> 00:31:09.471
Guilty Gear!

00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:10.791
That's not an anime.

00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:11.931
That's a game, but yes.

00:31:11.991 --> 00:31:12.671
A Blazblue?

00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:14.212
Yeah, that too!

00:31:14.612 --> 00:31:16.972
Yeah, everybody likes Cold Geass!

00:31:17.092 --> 00:31:17.712
Yeah!

00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:21.455
FUWAMOCO

00:31:31.582 --> 00:31:40.126
FUWAMOCO You know, we'll definitely find out a lot more on what exactly Justice is very soon!

00:31:41.787 --> 00:31:42.627
Ruffians!

00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:45.128
We get to do that all together!

00:31:45.229 --> 00:31:53.692
Because Advent, we're gonna be doing a watch-along of Justice's debuts on both day 1 and day 2!

00:31:57.445 --> 00:31:59.268
Off-colab!

00:31:59.308 --> 00:32:00.309
BAU BAU!

00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:06.556
Please join us and all of us for an amazingly fun time over the weekend, okay?

00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:12.202
You can check it out over on the official hololive English YouTube channel, okay?

00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:13.103
BAU BAU!

00:32:15.245 --> 00:32:18.908
It's another FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:18.948 --> 00:32:22.531
That means we have a doggy of a day today, right?

00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:24.892
Today's doggy of a day is... De-den!

00:32:40.143 --> 00:32:43.285
Skylar looks a little bit perplexed.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.583
How does Skylar BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:33:23.137 --> 00:33:24.618
Very excited in the kitty pool.

00:33:24.638 --> 00:33:25.959
Doggy pool now.

00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:26.920
Squirtle is super cute!

00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:44.914
I'm ready for summer when I look at this picture of Skylar.

00:33:45.154 --> 00:33:48.196
Maybe she can be our pool buddy this summer.

00:33:49.036 --> 00:33:51.998
Maybe this time we'll actually go swimming.

00:33:52.478 --> 00:33:54.460
As long as Skylar's there with us, right?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.161
Then we won't be so alone.

00:33:56.381 --> 00:33:57.922
We can't go swimming with Pero.

00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:03.855
But Skylar, BAU BAU!

00:34:06.036 --> 00:34:09.338
And next, Ruffians, it's not just Skylar that's been going for runs, right?

00:34:09.378 --> 00:34:11.579
You've been going for walks too, right?

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:15.581
Let's take a look at our Today I Went On A Walk!

00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:18.362
We have De-den!

00:34:19.462 --> 00:34:22.725
Another really cooling picture!

00:34:23.065 --> 00:34:24.646
So beautiful!

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:27.809
We hope that you're able to stay out of the sun rays.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.150
It does look hot, huh?

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.970
Right!

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.773
Yeah, make sure, Ruffians, that you don't forget your sunscreen, okay?

00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:37.756
I know it can be sticky and like... No, I don't want sunscreen.

00:34:37.956 --> 00:34:39.257
Sunscreen!

00:34:39.857 --> 00:34:41.539
Make sure you put it on, okay?

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:42.659
It's very important.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.480
Yeah.

00:34:45.701 --> 00:34:48.462
The buildings have deadly lasers!

00:34:49.222 --> 00:34:51.863
Think of that and then apply the sunscreen, okay?

00:34:52.183 --> 00:34:53.044
Ruffians!

00:34:53.824 --> 00:34:54.584
Ruffians!

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:58.765
Which one of you are guilty of not putting on sunscreen?

00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:01.406
Raise your paws.

00:35:02.527 --> 00:35:03.247
Ruffians!

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:06.089
You!

00:35:06.189 --> 00:35:06.810
You!

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.510
You!

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:07.950
You!

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.732
Why do I see so many me's and no not me's?

00:35:11.952 --> 00:35:12.252
Huh?

00:35:12.272 --> 00:35:15.514
No, if you stay inside, you still need sunscreen, okay?

00:35:15.714 --> 00:35:16.395
Yeah!

00:35:16.575 --> 00:35:21.397
Unless you don't have any windows or any natural light sources or... Maybe it's okay.

00:35:21.417 --> 00:35:22.878
But if you have a window!

00:35:23.018 --> 00:35:23.378
Yeah!

00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:24.179
Okay!

00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:25.879
You need to put on sunscreen, okay?

00:35:25.939 --> 00:35:26.400
Yeah!

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.843
And if you think... If you think, oh well, I don't like sunscreen... That's because you haven't found the right sunscreen yet!

00:35:32.883 --> 00:35:33.864
That's the wrong one!

00:35:34.104 --> 00:35:34.484
Yeah!

00:35:36.642 --> 00:35:37.223
Okay.

00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:41.664
Even if you don't learn, it's important.

00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:42.744
Wear the sunscreen.

00:35:44.025 --> 00:35:44.425
Got it.

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:47.486
Well, there was a question here.

00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:51.307
Are FUWAMOCO afraid of water?

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.148
We're not the best with water.

00:35:54.468 --> 00:35:56.929
We can swim, you know, but we're demon dogs.

00:35:57.189 --> 00:35:58.189
Demon dogs, we don't.

00:36:01.946 --> 00:36:08.776
You know, it's fun, but we don't really like jumping in, or deep water, and then we become all soggy.

00:36:08.897 --> 00:36:10.038
I can doggy paddle!

00:36:10.058 --> 00:36:13.624
Yeah, I'm confident in my doggy paddle.

00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:16.439
Not the deep diving.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.601
We'll leave the more aquatic stuffs to normal dogs.

00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:24.082
You know, Gura-senpai.

00:36:24.362 --> 00:36:28.303
BAU BAU!

00:36:28.323 --> 00:36:33.244
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:36:34.064 --> 00:36:37.786
And today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:41.127
This is a question for us to ask when you arrive in Japan.

00:36:41.207 --> 00:36:42.787
Oh, it's gone past a bit.

00:36:43.373 --> 00:36:45.996
A little bit of an oldie question, but a good question!

00:36:46.357 --> 00:36:50.902
FUWAMOCO, what was the first thing you ate after arriving in Japan?

00:36:51.183 --> 00:36:55.829
I think we talked about this once.

00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:57.190
Very delicious!

00:36:58.973 --> 00:36:59.974
The first thing we ate.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.191
What is a salad bag?

00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:05.153
A bag of just sliced cabbage.

00:37:05.733 --> 00:37:09.115
It's good because what you do is you just open the bag.

00:37:09.795 --> 00:37:11.496
And then you put in your salad dressing.

00:37:11.977 --> 00:37:14.098
And then you take your chopsticks and you mix it all up.

00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:15.759
But then we had a pon-de-ring!

00:37:15.819 --> 00:37:21.122
We had a pon-de-ring after, so... So it's not that sad, right?

00:37:21.763 --> 00:37:24.464
It's kind of like you can just imagine the pon-de-ring was first, right?

00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:25.365
Right!

00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:26.525
Yeah.

00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:34.227
Nattou wa... What about the nattou?

00:37:34.247 --> 00:37:35.910
Nattou can wait.

00:37:37.032 --> 00:37:38.415
Nattou wa atokara.

00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:47.384
BAU BAU!

00:37:47.404 --> 00:37:51.808
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:04.177
Remember Ruffians, if you go on a walk and you see something... Oh!

00:38:04.638 --> 00:38:05.338
That's kinda cool!

00:38:05.398 --> 00:38:07.100
I see FUWAMOCO like this, or... Oh!

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.940
That's kinda cool!

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.662
I think FUWAMOCO wouldn't like this!

00:38:09.682 --> 00:38:10.702
Share it with us, okay?

00:38:10.822 --> 00:38:13.725
If you think they wouldn't like it, I don't know, you never learn.

00:38:14.105 --> 00:38:16.887
Or if you happen to see Perroccino, something that we're not gonna like.

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:17.708
Share that with us.

00:38:17.748 --> 00:38:21.350
Or if you see a cute dog... Share it with us!

00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:23.832
I wanted to become the Doggie of the Day!

00:38:23.872 --> 00:38:24.813
We saw a cute dog.

00:38:25.013 --> 00:38:26.154
Right, Moco-chan?

00:38:26.494 --> 00:38:27.135
I got scared.

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:34.749
But please let us know with the hashtag.

00:38:35.169 --> 00:38:38.210
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.492
BAU BAU!

00:38:40.512 --> 00:38:43.533
And we have another stream coming up.

00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:46.334
Very soon after this one.

00:38:46.714 --> 00:38:47.535
We have...

00:38:48.297 --> 00:38:51.222
Keep talking and nobody explodes!

00:38:51.242 --> 00:38:51.462
BAU BAU!

00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:03.743
It's gonna be a little bit messy, right?

00:39:04.263 --> 00:39:06.965
Yeah, but we played this a little while ago.

00:39:07.025 --> 00:39:09.086
I've completely forgotten how to stop the bombs.

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.427
But I'm gonna help Moco-chan!

00:39:10.807 --> 00:39:15.870
I'm gonna give the instructions and we'll see just how good of a team we are because twins are always a good team, right?

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.810
We're a very good team, huh?

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.491
Yeah, we're gonna show our teamwork.

00:39:19.011 --> 00:39:19.431
Yeah!

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:23.912
Please join us, okay, Ruffians?

00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:30.560
And then very shortly after that, our new kouhai, Justice, will be making their debuts!

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.101
BAU BAU!

00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:36.406
Maybe let's take a quick peek at the schedule.

00:39:38.328 --> 00:39:42.029
While our kohai make their debuts, we're gonna be watching over them!

00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:42.829
Yeah!

00:39:43.129 --> 00:39:46.270
All together with Advent, cause we're doing a watch-along!

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.851
And it will be on the hololive English official channel.

00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:50.832
Like I mentioned.

00:39:51.832 --> 00:40:00.734
And then, after Justice finishes all the debuts, then FUWAMOCO, you know, we thought that maybe we'd chat all together.

00:40:00.754 --> 00:40:03.135
Play some Suika game time a bit!

00:40:04.035 --> 00:40:05.996
And I know we had it scheduled for...

00:40:09.442 --> 00:40:11.063
1130 PM PT.

00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:13.764
But it might be a bit later.

00:40:13.864 --> 00:40:14.985
Might be a bit later.

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:19.048
We will be back as fast as we can, okay?

00:40:19.068 --> 00:40:20.869
We're gonna run, Ruffians.

00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:22.249
Okay.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.291
How about Batsu game?

00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:24.371
Huh?

00:40:30.334 --> 00:40:34.297
What do you mean we have to play Suika game with the punishment, huh?

00:40:36.122 --> 00:40:40.004
What if the punishment is that we buy a bunch of the fruits and then we have to eat them?

00:40:41.885 --> 00:40:44.826
Is that a punishment?

00:40:45.086 --> 00:40:46.267
I don't like fruit.

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:57.426
And then, FUWAMOCO, we're gonna do our best on Sunday because that's a big homework day for us.

00:40:57.786 --> 00:40:59.887
Wish us luck, Ruffians!

00:41:00.067 --> 00:41:02.328
BAU BAU!

00:41:02.348 --> 00:41:08.630
And for Ruffians who are joining us to the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO word!

00:41:09.491 --> 00:41:11.412
It's BAU BAU debuts!

00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:12.172

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:21.684

And for waking up early to be able to share your morning with us every day this week!

00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:29.551
It's a big day!

00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:36.016

00:41:36.777 --> 00:41:37.898

It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:42:14.668 --> 00:42:16.850
It's too fast.

00:42:18.331 --> 00:42:18.972

00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:20.773

00:42:20.853 --> 00:42:21.634

00:42:23.955 --> 00:42:29.540
