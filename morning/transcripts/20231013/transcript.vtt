05:52.446 --> 05:54.188
And this is FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:55.148 --> 05:55.929
Good morning world.

05:56.930 --> 05:58.291
Good morning you out there.

06:00.012 --> 06:01.073
I am not a chihuahua.

06:01.973 --> 06:02.974
I am Fuwawa.

06:03.815 --> 06:05.116
Fuwawa Abyssgard.

06:06.491 --> 06:12.035
I'll be your host today, together with our team at Northeast Passage Communications.

06:13.256 --> 06:17.319
Delivering you the hottest and the most leading news of the hour.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.900
This is FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.763
Your news, our business.

06:25.204 --> 06:26.045
Business as usual.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.704
FUWAMOCO Morning is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

06:39.426 --> 06:40.207
Help me!

06:40.587 --> 06:52.239
Here at the Northeast Passage Communications, we deliver you the news you need in order to go about your day with a protected smile because you know what you need to do to stay safe.

06:53.260 --> 06:57.544
And hopefully, that will allow you to keep you and your feet grounded.

06:58.598 --> 07:04.143
Please inform us of any breaking news with the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

07:05.064 --> 07:08.006
Let nothing surprise us as we go about our business.

07:11.009 --> 07:14.272
Now, we begin today's broadcast with some breaking news.

07:16.754 --> 07:21.958
There have been reports of severe shortages worldwide of pon-de-ring mochi donuts.

07:23.052 --> 07:36.092
Different from any other donut, which is a simple piece of dough that has been deep fried and has no relation to nuts, a pon-de-ring is made with glutinous rice flour and is chewy and pliable and loved by many.

07:37.299 --> 07:45.681
Even dogs, man's best friend, have had a strange fascination with them, similar to their desire to chew on sticks from trees.

07:47.142 --> 07:55.784
However, in recent months, the price of these donuts has exploded tenfold, creating a black market for these mochi donuts.

07:56.745 --> 08:00.566
But only just now, have they almost completely disappeared.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.407
Almost as if they've gone extinct.

08:05.788 --> 08:07.369
No one can find a single pawn.

08:08.430 --> 08:20.536
Other donut manufacturers have tried to pass off their own donuts as mochi donuts, but no custard nor apple fritter can or will sway the heart of the consumers.

08:22.097 --> 08:29.982
With all that is going on in this world, can we simply stand idly by as we watch yet another beloved existence disappear?

08:35.168 --> 08:35.969
This is the news.

08:36.590 --> 08:37.471
It is our business.

08:38.572 --> 08:39.734
Business as usual.

08:43.839 --> 08:44.300
Moving on.

08:48.496 --> 08:51.399
In the world of science, there has been a new breakthrough.

08:52.300 --> 08:57.465
Seasonal allergies have plagued millions around the world for centuries without much relief.

08:58.306 --> 09:06.374
There have been temporary solutions such as daily medicine, air purification, nasal sprays, the list goes on.

09:07.575 --> 09:14.602
However, finally the sciences of the top universities worldwide have come together to unleash their knowledge.

09:15.102 --> 09:20.528
And now, as if an exorcism, seasonal allergies have ceased to exist.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.691
No more runny noses.

09:25.092 --> 09:26.293
No more teary eyes.

09:27.955 --> 09:28.896
And most thankfully,

09:32.708 --> 09:33.148
Silence.

09:33.328 --> 09:34.349
Why am I here?

09:34.609 --> 09:36.549
There are no more sneezes any longer.

09:36.569 --> 09:37.790
What's happening?

09:37.810 --> 09:45.032
Nothing to surprise you or disturb you while you're reading quietly in the public library as one digilently does every day.

09:46.072 --> 09:46.733
There is peace.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.994
Peace in a world without sneezes.

09:51.214 --> 09:54.315
Who knew advancements in science could go this far?

09:55.495 --> 09:58.316
Thank you, doctors, for all your hard work.

09:59.477 --> 10:00.497
What will they cure next?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.421
This is the news.

10:07.321 --> 10:08.142
It is our business.

10:09.843 --> 10:10.843
Business as usual.

10:10.863 --> 10:13.985
BAU BAU!

10:15.386 --> 10:16.367
BAU BAU!

10:16.527 --> 10:18.769
Now, for recent pop culture news.

10:19.249 --> 10:28.535
Vtubers, also known as virtual TVtubers, have become all the rage with those who follow the most current trends in technology and music.

10:29.701 --> 10:38.164
They sing, they dance, they play video games, and it's the ones from hololive Indonesia who will be having a big celebration.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.665
Their 3D showcases.

10:41.946 --> 10:46.968
Vesira Zeta, Kaila Kowalskia, and Kobo Kanaeru.

10:47.328 --> 11:00.238
We'll be showcasing themselves in their 3D bodies this month, starting with Zetta, the mysterious 7th recruit of the Secret Archive Unit that has a full license to collect virtual data.

11:01.739 --> 11:05.242
A full license to collect YOUR virtual data.

11:08.544 --> 11:11.727
She'll be having her showcase on Sunday the 15th at 6am PT.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.322
And you won't want to miss it or else.

11:18.943 --> 11:19.223
Right?

11:21.045 --> 11:25.849
You would never want to be left out of all the fun and entertainment that your friends are enjoying.

11:26.850 --> 11:33.355
So, make sure to stay glued to your screen and enjoy all the TV tubers that hololive has to offer.

11:33.375 --> 11:38.559
This is the news.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.221
It is our business.

11:42.002 --> 11:42.923
Business as usual.

11:46.576 --> 11:53.019
Next, I would like to switch to our resident meteorologist, Mr. Perochini, for our weather forecast.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.701
Perochini, you're live.

12:08.127 --> 12:16.071
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, and I am Perochini, giving you all your real-time weather updates.

12:17.276 --> 12:28.406
As almost everyone here knows, there has been some serious storm activity recently after that weather front settled in permanently one year ago.

12:28.426 --> 12:34.071
Here is a viewer submitted video we received just moments ago.

12:38.895 --> 12:39.856
Wow.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.839
Looks like things might have calmed down a bit there.

12:44.810 --> 12:47.031
That's a pretty nice drive to work.

12:47.851 --> 12:54.934
Remember, when the rain falls, umbrellas and jackets are completely useless.

12:56.035 --> 13:03.258
Please remember to do your part in saving the planet and forget those at home.

13:04.018 --> 13:10.721
The best you can do is give yourself to the storm and become as wet as a dog.

13:11.701 --> 13:13.022
Good luck out there folks.

13:15.990 --> 13:19.232
This is business as usual.

13:20.352 --> 13:21.813
Back to you, Fuwawa.

13:26.235 --> 13:29.657
Thank you, Perochini, for the weather update.

13:30.657 --> 13:33.098
Remember, you will get wet.

13:33.979 --> 13:34.979
You cannot resist it.

13:37.020 --> 13:37.721
This is the news.

13:38.561 --> 13:39.582
It is our business.

13:41.422 --> 13:42.263
Business as usual.

13:46.030 --> 13:59.122
As we bring FUWAMOCO Morning to a close this Friday the 13th morning, we would like to remind you that this is a community-run show produced by the Northeast Passage Communications and you.

14:00.043 --> 14:01.444
You, the viewer.

14:02.965 --> 14:03.586
Our viewer.

14:05.011 --> 14:18.119
We would like to remind you to send us your submissions with the hashtag FWMCMORNING and that you share your life with our other viewers just like you.

14:20.681 --> 14:20.881
Now.

14:25.864 --> 14:31.108
Getting an appropriate amount of exercise is key to a long life and walking outside

14:33.777 --> 14:36.858
Walking outside can help promote a strong body.

14:37.738 --> 14:54.824
It boosts both your cardiovascular as well as pulmonary health, reduces risk of heart disease and stroke, improves management of conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, joint and muscular pain or stiffness, and diabetes.

14:55.885 --> 15:02.047
It is also proven that a walk outside can promote stronger bones and overall improve life balance.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.002
Here are some viewers who are taking control of their physical health.

15:42.688 --> 15:43.188
Thank you.

15:44.089 --> 15:45.430
Thank you very much for that.

15:46.691 --> 15:49.133
I feel much more inspired to go for a walk now.

15:50.654 --> 15:51.114
You too.

15:52.295 --> 15:52.695
Of course.

15:55.137 --> 15:55.517
Of course.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.619
BAU BAU.

15:58.979 --> 15:59.500
And finally.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.340
BAU BAU!

16:00.460 --> 16:03.783
We'd like to continue to our most popular segment.

16:05.164 --> 16:05.424
Yes.

16:06.565 --> 16:07.746
Our dog of today.

16:09.066 --> 16:09.647
Yesterday.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.008
Not tomorrow.

16:12.762 --> 16:18.526
Soon you will find out the secret to its popularity.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.787
Roll the tape.

16:20.927 --> 16:21.768
Help me.

17:28.490 --> 17:29.550
Why am I here?

17:33.892 --> 17:39.334
Thank you for joining us for October Friday the 13th, FUWAMOCO Morning.

17:42.836 --> 17:48.518
This, this is where we say goodbye for now, and maybe forever.

17:50.639 --> 17:52.460
Goodbye, chito.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.861
Goodbye, ponzu.

17:57.725 --> 18:00.006
Goodbye, Bishop.

18:01.866 --> 18:03.387
Goodbye, Stickboy.

18:04.868 --> 18:06.528
Goodbye, Andy-chan.

18:09.229 --> 18:10.610
Goodbye, Ricky.

18:13.671 --> 18:20.073

18:21.533 --> 18:28.082
