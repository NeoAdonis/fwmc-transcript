05:08.866 --> 05:10.987
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.567 --> 05:15.008
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:15.028 --> 05:21.850
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.870 --> 05:21.930
BAU!

05:22.550 --> 05:25.451
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:26.071 --> 05:28.552
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.732 --> 05:30.813
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.853 --> 05:31.893
BAU BAU!

05:34.081 --> 05:38.689
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.630 --> 05:45.680
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 48th episode!

05:47.367 --> 05:51.770
Oh my gosh, I feel like, Moco-chan, I still remember when we were at like the 27th episode.

05:52.191 --> 05:52.771
Right?

05:52.791 --> 05:54.192
And that was already a while.

05:54.252 --> 05:54.592
Right?

05:54.633 --> 05:55.933
And that was really exciting.

05:56.074 --> 05:59.136
But now we're at the 48th episode.

05:59.616 --> 06:02.879
Thank you, Ruffians, for sticking with us!

06:03.179 --> 06:04.040
Thank you!

06:04.180 --> 06:07.782
Or maybe some Ruffians who haven't been sticking with us because... Oh, that's okay.

06:07.842 --> 06:09.444
You're brand new, baby!

06:09.464 --> 06:16.409
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.430
Fuwa aka FUWAMOCO!

06:18.470 --> 06:19.952
Please explain it, Moco-chan.

06:20.152 --> 06:20.592
I'm sorry.

06:20.852 --> 06:22.273
I will be better next time.

06:22.934 --> 06:26.176
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:26.637 --> 06:32.201
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start off your day on the right paw.

06:32.522 --> 06:38.366
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:38.746 --> 06:42.369
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:42.870 --> 06:43.510
BAU BAU!

06:45.285 --> 06:48.926
BAU BAU!

06:49.226 --> 06:49.766
It's Friday!

06:50.266 --> 06:50.966
It's Friday.

06:51.066 --> 06:52.687
It's a silly day, you know?

06:52.707 --> 06:54.867
A silly day before the weekend, right?

06:54.887 --> 06:56.768
That's what Friday is, huh?

06:56.808 --> 06:57.728
Yeah.

06:58.308 --> 07:01.169
It's chill, why are you there, you know?

07:02.009 --> 07:02.529
Well!

07:03.570 --> 07:05.930
Have we had another... Perroccino?

07:05.970 --> 07:08.751
Ruffians, have you been keeping your eyes open for Peron?

07:09.531 --> 07:11.391
I think at least one ruffian has.

07:11.772 --> 07:13.292
Guys, we have!

07:14.842 --> 07:17.004
De-den!

07:18.145 --> 07:19.306
Oh my goodness!

07:19.566 --> 07:21.768
Petals up there in the sky!

07:22.268 --> 07:24.691
On top of those... things!

07:24.871 --> 07:25.211
Yeah.

07:25.932 --> 07:26.593
Those things.

07:26.893 --> 07:27.814
What are they?

07:28.174 --> 07:29.635
I'm never too sure what they are.

07:30.456 --> 07:32.177
What's he doing up there?

07:32.797 --> 07:36.580
Maybe he just wanted to get a really good view of his surroundings.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.582
Maybe he wanted to be really close to that Fuwawa blue sky!

07:41.602 --> 07:44.024
Why would he care about the Fuwawa blue sky?

07:44.504 --> 07:45.365
It's beautiful.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.185
I guess.

07:46.205 --> 07:46.985
Sure, sure.

07:47.486 --> 07:50.547
Well, whatever the reason, there must have been something good.

07:51.108 --> 07:51.548
Yeah.

07:51.568 --> 07:57.151
So that he wanted to be up there, you know, on that rusty, sort of, rickety structure.

07:57.171 --> 07:57.551
Yeah.

07:57.631 --> 07:58.212
Sabichi.

07:58.732 --> 08:00.553
That was strong, wasn't it?

08:00.573 --> 08:01.614
What did you do?

08:01.634 --> 08:02.715
I think you shouted something.

08:03.175 --> 08:08.359
What would you shout out to all the ruffians below you, Moco-chan?

08:24.184 --> 08:24.765
Oh, me?

08:24.865 --> 08:26.506
Yeah, you, Moco-chan.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.970
Is there any other Moco-chans out there?

08:30.430 --> 08:33.853
Ruffians, is there any other Moco-chans out there?

08:36.436 --> 08:37.096
Me?

08:37.236 --> 08:37.717
You.

08:38.317 --> 08:42.241
What would you yell to the Ruffians if you were up there?

08:42.441 --> 08:43.362
I wouldn't be up there.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.925
I've never thought about it, because I wouldn't be up there.

08:45.945 --> 08:47.927
I don't know.

08:49.463 --> 08:50.686
BAU BAU!

08:51.127 --> 08:51.668
I guess.

08:51.849 --> 08:52.911
I guess that makes sense.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.054
That's an obvious answer.

08:54.154 --> 08:55.377
Something more interesting.

08:56.038 --> 08:56.379
Catch me.

08:59.638 --> 09:00.379
RUFFIANS!

09:00.759 --> 09:01.760
CATCH ME!

09:04.683 --> 09:06.284
That's true, and then nothing happens.

09:06.924 --> 09:08.446
Yeah, I wouldn't jump down.

09:08.706 --> 09:12.489
The ruffians are just in a state of panic.

09:12.589 --> 09:16.112
Okay, I think that's Moco-chan.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.595
Whatever you do, don't fall, Peron!

09:20.055 --> 09:23.838
Well, he does have his wings, so maybe it shouldn't be too much of an issue.

09:23.858 --> 09:28.022
True, but he is a bit dense, though.

09:29.994 --> 09:32.616
Hopefully he's good up there.

09:33.036 --> 09:34.037
No, no, no.

09:34.637 --> 09:35.918
He's got his wings.

09:35.998 --> 09:37.259
Okay, he's got his wings.

09:37.839 --> 09:40.461
BAU BAU!

09:41.021 --> 09:41.662
He's great.

09:41.702 --> 09:42.502
He's an airbag.

09:43.363 --> 09:44.164
If only.

09:44.204 --> 09:44.904
He's dense.

09:45.204 --> 09:46.505
He's a dense bag.

09:46.565 --> 09:48.306
Two bones and all muscle.

09:49.007 --> 09:49.627
Yeah.

09:49.907 --> 09:50.468
Very dense.

09:52.748 --> 09:53.168
But!

09:53.309 --> 09:54.890
Happy news!

09:55.310 --> 09:56.391
Ruffians!

09:57.032 --> 09:58.693
Did you hear?

09:59.113 --> 09:59.513
Did you?

09:59.954 --> 10:00.394
Did you?

10:01.235 --> 10:01.935
It's happy news.

10:01.995 --> 10:03.517
It's not FUWAMOCO news.

10:03.977 --> 10:05.878
It's not Advent news.

10:06.419 --> 10:06.899
But!

10:07.620 --> 10:16.727
Marin-senchou-senpai is going to be making an appearance on Fuji TV's year-end FNF contest!

10:16.767 --> 10:18.008
Yes, on TV5!

10:19.622 --> 10:19.842
FNF!

10:19.862 --> 10:21.504
Have you heard of FNF?

10:21.544 --> 10:24.186
Coming outside the FNF music program.

10:24.206 --> 10:24.306
Right!

10:25.227 --> 10:26.969
Right!

10:27.049 --> 10:27.990
It's so exciting!

10:28.010 --> 10:30.953
She's gonna be the first VTuber ever to be on it.

10:31.393 --> 10:32.454
And it's a huge deal!

10:32.554 --> 10:33.555
It's a big deal!

10:33.675 --> 10:34.276
It's a huge deal!

10:34.756 --> 10:37.317
Yeah, we really like watching FNS Kaio-Sai.

10:37.337 --> 10:42.158
Because you know, you get to see all the hottest musical artists performing live.

10:42.238 --> 10:45.038
All the ones that are so popular during the year, right?

10:45.638 --> 10:47.799
Well, this year it's going to be split apart.

10:47.819 --> 10:49.959
The show's split apart into two days.

10:50.099 --> 10:51.960
It's a TV show.

10:52.100 --> 10:55.681
One day on December 6th, and one day on December 13th.

10:55.801 --> 11:00.102
And Mari Sancho-senpai is going to be on the second day, on the 13th.

11:02.262 --> 11:08.585
She's gonna be performing alongside other artists and idols like AKB48!

11:08.905 --> 11:11.007
Atarashii Gakkou no Leaders.

11:11.387 --> 11:11.907
Gackt.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.468
Sekai no Owari Yuzu.

11:14.628 --> 11:16.049
Momoe Rokobo's dad.

11:16.089 --> 11:16.509
Right!

11:16.649 --> 11:18.350
Even Hello Kitty, too!

11:18.390 --> 11:19.131
Hello Kitty!

11:19.271 --> 11:21.972
Oh my gosh, that's amazing, right?

11:22.572 --> 11:23.653
It's really amazing.

11:23.773 --> 11:25.874
It's really amazing.

11:26.234 --> 11:26.995
Right?

11:27.575 --> 11:29.336
Really, really amazing.

11:29.356 --> 11:29.776
Yeah!

11:29.836 --> 11:30.657
Hello Kitty!

11:30.677 --> 11:30.997
Yeah!

11:31.926 --> 11:32.826
It's really big.

11:32.846 --> 11:35.867
Let's all be excited, okay?

11:36.468 --> 11:38.308
We can't wait to see what it'll be like.

11:38.909 --> 11:43.690
But you know, for sure, we'll be cheering a bunch for Marine-senchou-senpai.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.411
Let's all do it together, okay?

11:45.991 --> 11:48.132
GANBARIM!

11:48.372 --> 11:50.152
BAU BAU!

11:50.653 --> 11:51.993
That's so cool.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.554
I was so happy when I saw that on Twitter.

11:54.574 --> 11:55.354
It's a big deal!

11:55.374 --> 11:55.574
Why?

11:58.999 --> 12:03.902
BAU BAU!

12:04.163 --> 12:05.343
Also a big deal.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.005
Isn't it a big deal?

12:09.707 --> 12:13.029
Ruffians, something silly is going on.

12:13.089 --> 12:14.450
I'm always a big deal.

12:17.072 --> 12:18.913
You think that's correct, Ruffians?

12:19.074 --> 12:20.355
Something silly is going on.

12:20.495 --> 12:23.197
I don't know, well...

12:24.713 --> 12:39.598
Before we could even really notice it, there has been a lot of ruffians, and maybe some new ruffians too, who've been watching Moco-chan's most recently uploaded YouTube show!

12:39.658 --> 12:39.858
Yeah!

12:40.279 --> 12:45.220
Yeah, Moco-chan's most recent show has reached 200,000 views!

12:45.520 --> 12:48.181
Yeah, you know the one where I go BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.922
That one where I go really fast?

12:50.962 --> 12:51.382
Yeah, 200,000 views!

12:53.583 --> 12:56.725
I, for some reason, you seem to really like it!

12:56.745 --> 12:58.626
And I'm really happy!

12:59.427 --> 13:01.408
But it is, it's pretty silly.

13:01.428 --> 13:02.648
It's pretty silly.

13:03.169 --> 13:06.711
But I guess it really resonated with some of you.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.912
Did it hit you in the heart?

13:10.073 --> 13:14.235
But thank you for watching a lot!

13:14.255 --> 13:15.636
I'm happy it hit you in the heart.

13:17.657 --> 13:19.258
How did you come up with this one?

13:21.198 --> 13:22.218
Moco-chan, tell the secrets.

13:23.279 --> 13:28.601
I BAU BAU really fast, and then I thought, well, maybe the ruffians would like to see my skills.

13:29.401 --> 13:29.601
Yup.

13:29.881 --> 13:30.522
It was simple.

13:30.562 --> 13:32.002
And that's how it was born.

13:32.022 --> 13:32.702
Uh-huh.

13:32.802 --> 13:32.963
Yeah.

13:34.903 --> 13:37.164
It's just me showing off my BAU BAU skills, okay?

13:37.184 --> 13:37.484
Yeah.

13:38.205 --> 13:41.286
Ruffians, what other kinds of shorts would you like to see from us?

13:41.566 --> 13:41.786
Yeah!

13:42.086 --> 13:42.766
You do?

13:42.786 --> 13:47.048
Probably just FUWAMOCO being FUWAMOCO his best, right?

13:47.068 --> 13:47.988
What?

13:48.048 --> 13:49.689
Do you have any ideas?

13:50.888 --> 13:55.191
Sneezing!

13:55.251 --> 13:56.332
Anything cute.

13:56.672 --> 13:57.253
Sneezing.

13:57.353 --> 13:59.234
I can't sneeze like that.

13:59.254 --> 14:02.317
Confusions.

14:02.657 --> 14:11.124
We like that too, but FUWAMOCO's not animated so we need to ask some really talented demon dogs to help out.

14:11.144 --> 14:13.686
FUWAMOCO!

14:13.846 --> 14:17.189
It's time to know if I'm the best BAU BAU-er though.

14:17.349 --> 14:18.470
Dentist appointment!

14:21.420 --> 14:24.423
For some reason I could feel like that would be popular.

14:24.523 --> 14:26.865
Rock Twisters.

14:28.747 --> 14:30.048
Lots of good ideas!

14:30.068 --> 14:32.651
Thank you, ruffians!

14:32.751 --> 14:34.973
I think maybe we know what you want to see a bit more.

14:34.993 --> 14:35.733
Secretly recorded.

14:36.883 --> 14:37.723
What?

14:37.904 --> 14:39.944
Secretly recorded voice lines.

14:40.565 --> 14:42.806
Actually, I was thinking of doing that, Tomoko-chan.

14:42.866 --> 14:43.286
Hai.

14:43.326 --> 14:45.947
When we were going to bed.

14:45.967 --> 14:49.569
What were you thinking of doing?

14:49.669 --> 14:56.232
It's not unusual, Ruffians, for us to kind of sing or like hum while we're brushing our teeth.

14:56.812 --> 15:01.294
FUWAMOCO-chan, you were brushing your teeth.

15:01.314 --> 15:07.317
You were brushing your teeth while singing ASCII Senpai's Without You.

15:07.837 --> 15:09.058
I thought it sounded funny.

15:12.039 --> 15:13.500
I didn't realize.

15:17.064 --> 15:21.087
Ruffians, what about any FUWAMOCO messages you want solved?

15:22.148 --> 15:22.848
Anything like that?

15:22.868 --> 15:24.530
Like an educational sort?

15:25.330 --> 15:28.693
You can always let us know on Twitter too, okay?

15:28.773 --> 15:31.416
Let us know in the comments too.

15:31.476 --> 15:34.198
Yeah, we'll give it a shot if you let us know, okay?

15:35.019 --> 15:38.241
BAU BAU!

15:38.902 --> 15:42.285
Speaking of Twitter... Ruffians...

15:46.707 --> 15:53.731
We saw that there was some discussion on Twitter about how powerful we are within hololive English.

15:55.492 --> 15:56.373
Did you see that one?

15:56.393 --> 15:57.173
Did you see that?

15:59.194 --> 16:01.055
Didn't make me that happy.

16:01.856 --> 16:08.540
Because you know, we were put in the C-rank category.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.081
Along with Ame-senpai.

16:11.101 --> 16:11.521
Excuse me!

16:16.400 --> 16:20.704
You know, you realize that we are demon guard dogs, right?

16:20.724 --> 16:22.925
We're powerful!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.527
We're not human!

16:24.687 --> 16:25.768
We'll fluff you up!

16:25.788 --> 16:27.069
You know it!

16:29.171 --> 16:31.913
You see these guard dog claws of ours, you know?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.295
You don't see them, right?

16:34.315 --> 16:39.237
That's because you'd be scared if we waved them around all the time.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.138
But they're there.

16:41.158 --> 16:42.938
And we'll use them.

16:45.679 --> 16:48.860
Oh gosh, you know, it hurts if we use them.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.160
It hurts, you know.

16:50.280 --> 16:54.042
So yeah, we're definitely way stronger than Ame-senpai.

16:55.302 --> 16:59.383
We're way stronger than Gura-senpai, Mumei-senpai, and Nerissai.

16:59.503 --> 17:01.043
Yeah, I guess I have no cards today.

17:01.063 --> 17:01.804
Yeah, Nerissai.

17:01.824 --> 17:04.844
You know, we're at least as strong as Bei-senpai.

17:04.944 --> 17:06.045
At least, you know!

17:06.085 --> 17:07.525
Yeah, you know.

17:07.845 --> 17:14.347
Just because we're cute doesn't mean that we won't use violence to protect what's important to us.

17:14.387 --> 17:15.367
But your smile, Ruffians!

17:15.407 --> 17:17.888
You know, we said we'd protect your smile!

17:18.228 --> 17:18.488
Yeah.

17:18.688 --> 17:19.108
And you know,

17:20.438 --> 17:25.684
We wouldn't say that if we didn't have confidence in our skills to be able to protect it when the time comes.

17:25.884 --> 17:27.206
We need to protect it!

17:27.226 --> 17:32.331
You know, when things need to get extra fluffy!

17:33.553 --> 17:34.394
Extra fuzzy!

17:36.078 --> 17:37.158
Extreme violence.

17:37.238 --> 17:37.899
Yeah.

17:38.339 --> 17:41.140
So, just hope that time never comes.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.881
You know, our callers, they're here for a reason.

17:46.682 --> 17:48.442
Looks can be deceiving, okay?

17:48.862 --> 17:49.382
Yeah.

17:49.563 --> 17:56.345
Ruffians, you know, if you think that Advent is weak, you'll be here for a rude awakening, okay?

17:56.845 --> 17:57.245
Got it.

17:59.786 --> 17:59.966
Yeah.

18:02.162 --> 18:02.963
We're guard dogs.

18:03.663 --> 18:05.124
Demon guard dogs.

18:05.604 --> 18:06.065
Got it.

18:07.806 --> 18:08.787
BAU BAU!

18:09.487 --> 18:10.148
BAU BAU!

18:10.288 --> 18:11.288
You understand now.

18:11.328 --> 18:12.269
Better be scared.

18:12.449 --> 18:13.230
BAU BAU!

18:13.490 --> 18:14.591
Better be scared.

18:14.631 --> 18:15.371
Yeah.

18:17.453 --> 18:17.973
BAU BAU.

18:18.253 --> 18:18.493
BAU BAU.

18:29.591 --> 18:33.192
I think there's another misunderstanding.

18:35.573 --> 18:39.094
Ruffians, I thought we were doing so well last week.

18:39.214 --> 18:39.974
We were!

18:40.654 --> 18:44.656
But this week, I think it's been a little bit rough.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.876
I know.

18:48.317 --> 18:50.717
There might have been another misunderstanding, Ruffians.

18:50.757 --> 18:52.498
But you know, it wasn't really our fault.

18:54.659 --> 18:55.339
Okay?

18:56.699 --> 18:56.999
I know.

19:00.649 --> 19:04.136
We had to use violence in an ugly way the other day.

19:04.156 --> 19:06.280
During Metal Gear Solid.

19:08.464 --> 19:11.991
Yeah... You see... There was some, uh... Very...

19:13.200 --> 19:16.683
Badly trained dogs that were very rude to us.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.323
You know it.

19:17.604 --> 19:18.004
Yeah.

19:18.544 --> 19:19.645
They almost ate us, okay?

19:19.665 --> 19:20.726
They almost ate us.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.366
Yeah.

19:21.527 --> 19:28.973
And so, you know, we might have had to give them a few bonks here and there to show them who's the top dog, right?

19:29.053 --> 19:30.153
Exactly, yeah.

19:30.534 --> 19:32.155
Cuz, you know, we're demon dogs.

19:32.215 --> 19:33.576
Just like we talked about.

19:33.596 --> 19:34.737
We're not dogs.

19:34.937 --> 19:35.998
We're different.

19:36.138 --> 19:36.479
Yeah.

19:36.519 --> 19:37.259
We're strong.

19:37.339 --> 19:37.780
Yeah.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.381
Very, very strong.

19:39.741 --> 19:40.242
So you know,

19:41.002 --> 19:42.604
They should not be biting us like that.

19:42.624 --> 19:43.725
No, they should not.

19:44.325 --> 19:54.894
Yeah, so... That's why we had to give them a little bonk even though, you know, we might have been safe at that point.

19:55.315 --> 19:57.316
It's just, it's just natural, you know.

19:57.777 --> 19:59.158
It's nature's law.

19:59.178 --> 19:59.839
Yeah.

20:00.319 --> 20:04.963
You know, the strong demon guard dog bonks the ballet trained dog.

20:05.364 --> 20:06.445
You know how it goes.

20:06.665 --> 20:06.845
Yeah.

20:07.975 --> 20:09.136
You've heard it before, right?

20:10.456 --> 20:13.978
The strong demon guard dog, boxed about with three dogs.

20:14.258 --> 20:15.278
Extreme headbutt.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.059
Yeah.

20:16.659 --> 20:18.300
Very strong headbutt.

20:18.320 --> 20:18.900
Just like that.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.420
BAU BAU!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.302
It was okay.

20:23.382 --> 20:28.064
As a dachshund, you know, cute, well-behaved animals would get pet.

20:28.304 --> 20:28.784
Good pet.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.705
Bad ones, hard pet.

20:30.745 --> 20:31.286
Hard pet.

20:31.326 --> 20:31.846
Strong pet.

20:32.546 --> 20:34.567
No misunderstanding, okay?

20:34.847 --> 20:39.169
Yeah, it's just the rules of nature, you know?

20:39.570 --> 20:42.591
You try to eat us, get hard pet.

20:44.092 --> 20:46.133
BAU BAU!

20:47.113 --> 20:51.175
Ruffians, you know?

20:51.476 --> 20:55.257
Yesterday we had, uh... Just chatting?

20:55.318 --> 20:56.018
Just chatting!

20:56.118 --> 20:58.679
I remember it's only just chatting.

20:58.939 --> 20:59.900
Did you have fun?

21:05.015 --> 21:06.537
I think the ruffians have fun.

21:09.541 --> 21:18.007
Ah, well, you know, we did kind of talk about it a little bit, but it was Thanksgiving yesterday in America, right?

21:18.027 --> 21:18.127
Right!

21:18.708 --> 21:22.631
Happy Thanksgiving, Ruffians!

21:22.671 --> 21:24.592
Ruffians in the U.S.?

21:25.913 --> 21:30.196
Whenever you say gobo gobo gobo gobo, it kind of reminds me of Kobo Senpai.

21:30.677 --> 21:30.777
Oh.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.358
Boko boko bokoi.

21:33.799 --> 21:35.080
Gobo gobo gobo gobo.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.702
Oh, now Kobo Senpai has to say it.

21:37.942 --> 21:37.982
Oh.

21:39.284 --> 21:39.604
Wow.

21:41.405 --> 21:42.705
Anyway, ruffians!

21:42.905 --> 21:47.967
But you know, we hope that you had a very nice time together with your family and your loved ones.

21:49.388 --> 21:52.889
But for FUWAMOCO, it wasn't the same.

21:53.049 --> 21:55.230
It wasn't!

21:55.530 --> 22:03.753
In the Northwest Passage, we have something similar, but... It's kind of hard to translate to...

22:04.625 --> 22:05.506
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

22:22.768 --> 22:25.069
But, you know, it happens a bit earlier in the year.

22:25.089 --> 22:25.649
Yeah.

22:25.729 --> 22:30.290
Because, you know, in the Northwest Passage, it gets cold really fast.

22:30.710 --> 22:37.392
So, it's kind of... It's better to come out of our homes earlier to see our families than before it gets too frigid out, you know?

22:37.452 --> 22:37.652
Yeah.

22:37.832 --> 22:41.813
You know, and we share a lot of our favorite foods that are abundant at the time.

22:41.873 --> 22:42.133
Yeah.

22:42.273 --> 22:45.333
And, you know, it's sort of similar to kind of what you have.

22:46.114 --> 22:51.455
Except, you know, this is actually the one time of year that we hunt

22:54.156 --> 22:54.576
Boobs!

22:54.977 --> 22:55.597
Boobs!

22:55.657 --> 22:57.158
You remember, right?

22:57.238 --> 22:57.718
Right!

22:57.798 --> 22:58.378
Boobs.

22:58.438 --> 23:01.580
They're all over the place at this time of year, you know?

23:01.620 --> 23:02.680
You remember that one?

23:02.700 --> 23:03.841
Yeah!

23:03.881 --> 23:04.401
Yeah!

23:04.541 --> 23:07.883
You know, we make sure to cook the boobs properly though, you know?

23:07.943 --> 23:10.464
Otherwise, it could be a little dangerous.

23:10.504 --> 23:12.265
Just like any meat, you know?

23:12.285 --> 23:13.986
You have to cook them properly, okay?

23:14.006 --> 23:14.166
Yeah.

23:14.446 --> 23:17.807
Yeah, but it's a very different taste though.

23:17.887 --> 23:25.310
It's like a more hearty, savory jelly, but maybe it's a very rich taste too.

23:25.330 --> 23:26.350
Rich taste, yeah.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.991
But you know, it's really easy to get full from the thighs.

23:29.031 --> 23:31.712
Yeah, a little boob goes a long way.

23:33.132 --> 23:35.013
You know, it doesn't have to be a big one.

23:35.393 --> 23:36.753
It doesn't, no.

23:36.934 --> 23:39.815
It's really great during these cold times.

23:40.455 --> 23:41.896
Ruffians, what do you think?

23:42.356 --> 23:42.996
What do you think?

23:43.356 --> 23:45.717
Do you think you'd like to try eating boobs, too?

23:46.737 --> 23:58.862
This year, we decided not to spend it with Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy, because you know we're pretty busy, but we're sure there'll be more chances to see them and spend time with them in the future, you know?

23:59.022 --> 24:00.423
You know, but...

24:01.795 --> 24:01.895
Huh?

24:02.155 --> 24:02.875
What's it made out of?

24:02.935 --> 24:04.696
It's made out of boob!

24:04.996 --> 24:05.496
Boob!

24:05.616 --> 24:08.096
Boob is boob!

24:08.656 --> 24:09.297
Boob!

24:09.837 --> 24:12.477
I thought... You don't remember boobs!

24:13.117 --> 24:13.697
Wait!

24:13.978 --> 24:17.358
I was gonna say, do you know what hamburger's made out of?

24:17.398 --> 24:18.018
What?

24:18.258 --> 24:18.678
How?

24:21.579 --> 24:22.919
Boob is made out of boob.

24:23.079 --> 24:24.600
It's made out of boob!

24:24.700 --> 24:26.060
Steak is made out of steak.

24:26.180 --> 24:26.740
Yeah!

24:26.940 --> 24:27.220
Yeah.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.360
It's the same thing.

24:28.761 --> 24:29.741
Pork, pork.

24:29.921 --> 24:30.781
Boob, boob.

24:31.365 --> 24:31.765
Got it?

24:32.186 --> 24:32.506
Yeah.

24:33.647 --> 24:35.028
It's not difficult, ruffians.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.230
You gotta use your head.

24:37.831 --> 24:42.555
I hope that you enjoyed learning a little bit more about the FUWAMOCO from ruffians.

24:43.236 --> 24:45.758
BAU BAU!

24:46.358 --> 24:53.104
It's always a little bit funny kind of sharing about the Northwest passes because it's not very cool.

24:57.529 --> 25:00.031
I don't want it to be misunderstood either.

25:00.051 --> 25:01.313
No, no misunderstanding.

25:03.595 --> 25:03.935
Wow.

25:04.435 --> 25:05.276
Ruffians!

25:05.456 --> 25:05.897
Wow!

25:07.939 --> 25:10.020
In case you didn't know, Ruffians!

25:10.040 --> 25:11.101
Oh my gosh, you didn't know.

25:11.121 --> 25:13.043
Tomorrow!

25:14.324 --> 25:15.666
It's twin day.

25:15.966 --> 25:17.908
Do you remember?

25:19.873 --> 25:19.993
Soi!

25:20.093 --> 25:21.974
We're releasing a brand new song coming!

25:22.034 --> 25:22.554
Cause it's twin day!

25:22.574 --> 25:23.474
It's super exciting, ruffians!

25:23.534 --> 25:39.940
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

25:40.242 --> 25:46.968
But I think maybe some of you might be a bit curious just what song it will be.

25:47.108 --> 25:48.509
Because we haven't talked about it yet.

25:48.529 --> 25:49.590
We haven't told you yet.

25:49.670 --> 25:51.231
It's been a big secret.

25:52.232 --> 25:56.556
Wow, ruffians.

25:57.576 --> 25:59.618
Maybe we should let you know.

25:59.938 --> 26:00.799
Would you like that?

26:00.859 --> 26:02.380
Maybe we should let you know now!

26:02.460 --> 26:02.641
Yeah!

26:10.271 --> 26:11.352
Wow!

26:11.372 --> 26:11.432
Wow!

26:11.812 --> 26:13.113
Can we get a drumroll?

26:13.133 --> 26:15.675
Oh, I thought we would just do a drumroll right away.

26:16.355 --> 26:16.716
No.

26:16.736 --> 26:18.597
Let's do it all together tomorrow.

26:18.637 --> 26:19.658
Drumrolls are important.

26:19.738 --> 26:19.938
Okay.

26:19.958 --> 26:20.218
Yeah.

26:20.458 --> 26:20.678
Okay.

26:21.079 --> 26:36.990
Dikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikadikad

26:40.754 --> 26:44.376
We felt it was a very appropriate song for twin day, you know?

26:44.416 --> 26:45.377
Don't you feel that way?

26:47.238 --> 26:56.805
We're really excited to have you listen to it and we hope that you'll join us not only for the premiere but also for the special after party we'll be having right after too.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.007
And also for our collab with Rui-senpai.

26:59.087 --> 27:00.007
Right before.

27:00.067 --> 27:04.891
Be with us for the whole day.

27:05.251 --> 27:07.032
It's twin day after all.

27:07.052 --> 27:08.974
You don't have other twins to spend it with, right?

27:09.054 --> 27:09.374
You don't!

27:10.094 --> 27:10.914
Why you don't?

27:10.994 --> 27:12.975
That would be horrible.

27:13.175 --> 27:16.496
Please look forward to it!

27:16.516 --> 27:16.596
Yes!

27:16.636 --> 27:18.856
BAU BAU!

27:20.317 --> 27:23.178
It's gonna be a very exciting weekend!

27:23.498 --> 27:23.818
But!

27:24.338 --> 27:28.099
You know, before we go to the weekend... We have...

27:29.333 --> 27:32.356
I'm Doggie of the Day!

27:32.736 --> 27:38.562
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Today is Koi!

27:38.742 --> 27:39.803
Koi!

27:39.963 --> 27:42.866
You can't quite see it, but it looks like...

27:43.720 --> 27:44.621
Moco-chan!

28:03.718 --> 28:07.540
We have to prove to Clyde that FUWAMOCO is good for naps too.

28:08.080 --> 28:08.220
Oh.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.001
Right.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.481
You know, we're fluffy and fuzzy.

28:10.501 --> 28:10.922
Yeah.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.542
That means we're very cozy now.

28:12.602 --> 28:13.923
Right, right.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.624
Right.

28:15.644 --> 28:16.184
Got it.

28:16.984 --> 28:18.465
Fluffy and fuzzy.

28:18.505 --> 28:20.166
We're gonna have to prove ourselves.

28:20.406 --> 28:23.708
How's this, Clyde?

28:23.728 --> 28:24.368
BAU BAU.

28:24.448 --> 28:27.289
Maybe like, uh, uh, hypersmart?

28:27.309 --> 28:28.990
Maybe like Korone-senpai?

28:30.491 --> 28:30.711
Huh.

28:32.393 --> 28:35.395
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

28:46.145 --> 28:54.607
Oh wow, Clyde is really cute and thankful for all the walks and cozy naps when he gets together with Kedama Korone-senpai.

28:54.647 --> 28:56.667
It's a good season for the cozy naps.

28:56.687 --> 28:57.368
Right, you know.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.648
And especially when you're busy too.

28:59.668 --> 29:06.630
I think he likes being by your side best, but he understands that, you know, you have your important responsibilities to do too.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.551
So, he's not doing those times.

29:09.571 --> 29:11.833
He tries his best not to BAU BAU.

29:11.893 --> 29:12.453
He's best.

29:12.613 --> 29:14.454
Yeah, and be close with his friends.

29:14.514 --> 29:15.575
They're right.

29:15.995 --> 29:16.756
Good doggy.

29:16.796 --> 29:17.416
Good doggy.

29:17.496 --> 29:18.477
Yes, very much.

29:18.797 --> 29:22.560
BAU BAU!

29:22.720 --> 29:23.560
BAU BAU!

29:23.640 --> 29:25.361
Today I went on a walk.

29:25.421 --> 29:28.343
Ruffians are so good for going on walks, even when it's cold.

29:28.383 --> 29:31.465
Even when it's cold, maybe it's a bit dark, maybe it's not the best.

29:31.725 --> 29:32.306
Maybe.

29:32.646 --> 29:33.907
But we have...

29:34.451 --> 29:36.932
De-den!

29:36.992 --> 29:38.052
That's not cold at all.

29:38.072 --> 29:39.433
That looks pretty nice.

29:40.813 --> 29:44.115
This almost looks like a natural pero sighting, right?

29:44.675 --> 29:48.617
It does a bit, but... Wow, it's so cool, right?

29:48.677 --> 29:49.857
A pero hole!

29:50.437 --> 29:51.158
What?

29:51.778 --> 29:55.539
True, it kinda looks like a pero hole, but... No!

29:55.559 --> 30:01.361
The question is, is this a cave with cat ears or demon dog ears like us, Moco-chan?

30:04.147 --> 30:05.712
I always see demon dog ears.

30:06.034 --> 30:08.562
Yeah, you know, they're kind of pointy.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.970
I think cat ears are more round, right?

30:11.766 --> 30:15.009
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

30:36.168 --> 30:37.049
BAU BAU!

30:37.349 --> 30:40.310
Please enjoy the nice warm weather.

30:42.071 --> 30:43.232
BAU BAU!

30:44.072 --> 30:48.695
And for our question of the day, we received a question from you, ruffians!

30:49.215 --> 30:50.575
Let's see, we have...

30:51.716 --> 30:55.779
FUWAMOCO, I have an important question to ask.

30:56.159 --> 31:08.167
You know that BAU BAU BYOU affects ruffians in various ways, and a few ruffians were talking about it the other day, so I wanted to know if you both also get affected by BAU BAU BYOU?

31:08.487 --> 31:10.269
It's a good question.

31:10.809 --> 31:12.971
FUWAMOCO, BAU BAU BYOU?

31:13.751 --> 31:16.353
I think I feel it a bit different than ruffians.

31:17.912 --> 31:25.780
You know, at the very least, we've been blue and pink for such a long time that those two colors, you know, together, they don't really affect us, you know.

31:25.820 --> 31:29.283
Right, because some ruffians, if you see blue and pink, you're like, FUWAMOCO!

31:29.343 --> 31:31.085
Right, you know, but I don't think that's quite...

31:31.977 --> 31:32.557
Mane-chan, right?

31:53.912 --> 32:07.767
And you know, so, we kind of easily sacrifice our sleep and other things that are really important to our daily lives to be able to do that, to be able to make sure Mana-chan's smiling and that we can protect your smiles, Ruffians.

32:07.807 --> 32:08.267
Right.

32:08.648 --> 32:09.769
You know, and we've done that.

32:10.359 --> 32:14.665
Repeatedly for the past almost 4 months.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.290
And that's not really a good thing.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.734
But it's been fun though.

32:21.754 --> 32:22.676
It's been fun!

32:22.776 --> 32:23.457
Yeah.

32:23.537 --> 32:24.818
It's probably not the best.

32:25.619 --> 32:29.441
Yeah, so I think that our BAU BAU view is a bit different.

32:29.501 --> 32:30.222
It's a bit different.

32:30.242 --> 32:33.964
Yeah, you know, we always want to be by your side to protect your smile.

32:34.364 --> 32:41.828
But in reality, we do need to give ourselves some downtime too sometimes, you know.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.370
Especially when our bodies are telling us, you need downtime.

32:45.390 --> 32:45.470
Good.

32:46.190 --> 32:46.530
Go.

32:47.231 --> 32:51.814
You know, it's rough sometimes, but we'll find a way to deal with it soon.

32:52.134 --> 32:52.395
Soon.

32:52.595 --> 32:52.975
Soon.

32:53.075 --> 32:55.056
Soon.

32:56.397 --> 32:58.099
BAU BAU!

32:58.419 --> 33:05.884
Thank you, ruffians, for all your submissions, your questions, for sharing your walks with us, and your doggy of the days too.

33:06.324 --> 33:13.349
Please remember if you have any other submissions, use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

33:13.690 --> 33:15.011
BAU BAU!

33:16.151 --> 33:27.397
And for our next team, well our next team is going to be over on Biboo's channel because we're having a watch-a-long each other with all of Abyss.

33:27.597 --> 33:31.699
This time it's Biboo's movie pick and we're watching John Wick.

33:32.119 --> 33:33.860
Biboo's pick is John Wick.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.481
I'm not sure what John Wick is.

33:36.621 --> 33:36.821
No.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.663
It's a movie about a person named John Wick.

33:40.734 --> 33:42.195
I think it's gonna be like Cobra.

33:42.496 --> 33:42.956
Cobra?

33:43.517 --> 33:45.118
Cobra was a movie about Cobra.

33:45.198 --> 33:46.599
A person named Cobra, right?

33:47.420 --> 33:49.482
Barbie was, uh, Barbie was named Barbie.

33:49.502 --> 33:50.984
Barbie was named something else, I don't remember.

33:51.364 --> 33:52.165
Barbie and, uh...

33:55.557 --> 34:03.542
So we hope that you'll join us in Advent all over on Biboo's channel to watch it.

34:03.642 --> 34:07.244
Don't forget to get your copy of the movie, okay, Ruffians?

34:08.004 --> 34:09.745
We also have another scene.

34:09.805 --> 34:15.429
It's not on our schedule, but we're going to be doing a super chat reading!

34:16.369 --> 34:17.269
FUWAMOCO!

34:17.309 --> 34:17.950
We'll be there!

34:17.990 --> 34:18.130
Yeah.

34:40.785 --> 34:41.926
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:41.986 --> 34:44.569
Let's have a really fun weekend, okay?

34:44.669 --> 34:47.812
But, what does the weekend have, Moco-chan?

34:48.173 --> 34:50.555
Well, we have... De-den!

34:50.575 --> 34:52.437
Our schedule.

34:52.497 --> 34:54.639
You know that tomorrow is twin day.

34:54.739 --> 34:55.560
It's a big day.

34:55.580 --> 35:00.786
We're gonna be starting off the day with our first collab ever with Ruri-chan-senpai!

35:00.906 --> 35:02.227
Our first collab!

35:02.267 --> 35:03.568
You know she really likes twins.

35:04.329 --> 35:08.571
We're gonna talk all about twins together with her on twin day.

35:09.052 --> 35:09.652
Exactly!

35:09.912 --> 35:12.173
After that, we have our accuracy ruffians.

35:12.594 --> 35:21.739
If you have any questions, or like ideas of things you'd like us to talk about, like, oh, write about this with twins, then write us your...

35:23.286 --> 35:26.367
Use the hashtag FUWAMOCO.

35:26.387 --> 35:26.948
FUWAMOCO.

35:26.968 --> 35:27.788
Hashtag H-E-L-P-F-W-M-C.

35:27.808 --> 35:32.190
What we think is interesting might be different from what you think is interesting.

35:32.230 --> 35:35.672
That would be very helpful actually.

35:35.812 --> 35:37.092
I would very much like that too.

35:39.213 --> 35:40.393
Please use that, okay?

35:40.573 --> 35:52.477
The FUWAMOCO hashtag is anything you think that could help us, whether it's questions, or you notice FUWAMOCO made a bit of a mistake here, or you're like, oh I have this fun thing that I made up.

35:52.577 --> 35:54.437
Maybe this would help FUWAMOCO.

35:54.737 --> 35:55.297
You know?

35:55.397 --> 35:57.038
So, please.

35:57.569 --> 35:59.471
Please let us know if you have any ideas.

35:59.511 --> 36:02.494
Yeah, you can find the hashtag in our schedule.

36:02.634 --> 36:04.296
Pinpoist too, if you're ever confused.

36:04.516 --> 36:06.598
Thank you, Ruffians!

36:06.739 --> 36:12.144
After that, we have a new song cover releasing, Identity!

36:12.284 --> 36:16.369
And then after that, we'll have an afterparty for Identity as well.

36:16.729 --> 36:17.470
And then on Sunday,

36:18.010 --> 36:22.371
Get ready for some more Yu-Gi-Oh party deluxe together!

36:22.431 --> 36:24.692
You're gonna need to teach us a thing or two, okay?

36:24.752 --> 36:25.853
Got it.

36:26.233 --> 36:28.133
And that's a weekend plan!

36:28.493 --> 36:35.596
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for this week's last FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:35.616 --> 36:36.136
This week.

36:36.176 --> 36:36.596
This week.

36:36.696 --> 36:37.456
Very important.

36:37.476 --> 36:38.997
That's the important part.

36:39.397 --> 36:45.519
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special Ruffians today!

36:48.539 --> 36:49.560
Kudekai.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.542
BAU BAU!

36:51.562 --> 36:51.682
Maitoe.

36:52.202 --> 36:52.983
BAU BAU!

36:53.003 --> 36:53.664

36:53.684 --> 36:55.125

36:58.007 --> 36:59.429

37:01.030 --> 37:02.652

Gremlin.

37:03.472 --> 37:04.653

37:04.693 --> 37:05.734
Claws.

37:05.754 --> 37:06.655

37:07.476 --> 37:08.517

37:15.903 --> 37:16.724
Terrible!

37:17.084 --> 37:18.446
BAU BAU!

37:18.466 --> 37:24.212
And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

37:24.232 --> 37:27.975
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:27.995 --> 37:29.097
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

37:29.397 --> 37:30.238
BAU BAU!
