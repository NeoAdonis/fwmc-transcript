## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (09:08)

It seems that Pero was nowhere to be found this weekend. Definitely it's not that sleepyhead Fuwawa didn't prepare this section or something...

## Short Video Upload (10:32)

How fast can Moco-chan BAU BAU? Watch FUWAMOCO's [latest short video](https://youtu.be/IvxENEi1mDI) to find out!

## Twitter Space (12:05)

The sisters had a Twitter Space where they cleaned as much fluff and fuzz as they could.

## Misunderstanding (13:24)

No misunderstandings today! At least, not one that sleepy FUWAMOCO can think of anyways...

## Anime NYC (14:48)

hololive English Advent will make an appearance at Anime NYC! And while their group panel will be on-site only, the members will have other small events there that will be also [broadcasted on VRChat](https://twitter.com/hololive_En/status/1724433458657710129) for free! Get ready for a Rock 'n Party mini, and a FWMC Q&A panel!

## Homework (17:44)

No rest for the wicked: as FUWAMOCO tried to get some homework done yesterday, more work was just added to their pile.

## Natto Challenge (19:41)

A sleepy Fuwawa ate the last pack of natto that morning, so for today's challenge Mococo had to eat a bunch of almonds instead.

## Doggie of the Day (22:55)

[Riki Tavatiki](https://twitter.com/RTavatiki/status/1722696513707712660) shows us a pic of Akah being protective about his food.

## Today I Went On A Walk (25:16)

Winter is coming, and so is darkness and snow as shown by [Sk√•ogin](https://twitter.com/skaogin/status/1722704257265148399).

## Question Of The Day (26:23)

[BooNeko](https://twitter.com/IyqZs/status/1722553207325614367) wanted to know who of the sisters was better at sports (Mococo is, it seems), as well as their favorite one (she had issues picking just one).
