00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.536
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:18.197 --> 00:05:21.381
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.984
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:25.766
BAU BAU!

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:31.837
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:34.618
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:37.558
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:39.859
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.220
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:53.642
Thank you for joining us today, Ruffians, for our 73rd episode!

00:05:53.662 --> 00:05:53.702
73rd!

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.022
I don't know, I feel like...

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:58.005
We're getting to the serious numbers, huh?

00:05:58.385 --> 00:05:58.806
Right!

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.008
Serious!

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:03.672
A human year is 73, you're like, retired.

00:06:04.393 --> 00:06:06.997
And we've had FUWAMOCO Morning for every year, huh?

00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:08.238
Right.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.004
But FUWAMOCO Morning is not retired any time soon.

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:13.225
No.

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:17.127
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning program held every Friday.

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:31.567
Friday!

00:06:32.148 --> 00:06:32.888
Wednesday!

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:34.069
Monday!

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.391
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.911
Hosted by us!

00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:41.433
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:43.374
Even the Ruffians know this!

00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:45.775
Don't know this, Ruffians!

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:48.077
Is it a program?

00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:52.939
If you're 73, you might refer to it as a program.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.541
If you're not, it's a show.

00:06:57.242 --> 00:07:00.984
I'm putting the 73 into the episode today, okay, Ruffians?

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:10.210
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.792
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:15.853
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:18.575
Moco-chan's desperate, please tweet them!

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:24.999
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.681
Nothing is different!

00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:32.902
No!

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:37.385
BAU BAU!

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:40.447
Well, oikaisen!

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:44.329
Nothing is different.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.730
And yet again!

00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:51.694
It looks like some Ruffians have spotted Pero.

00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.637
Nothing's different.

00:07:55.657 --> 00:07:57.438
Well, where was Pero spotted then?

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:58.719
Uh...

00:07:59.983 --> 00:08:02.625
De-den!

00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:06.087
Is Pero going for a swim?

00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:12.191
Maybe he's just taking it easy and relaxing in the water, you know?

00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:15.814
Maybe trying to get away from all the busyness in the world?

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:20.297
Or did he drown?

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:23.699
He can swim.

00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:26.838
What do you think it is, Ruffians?

00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:27.179
He can swim.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.021
I've never seen Pero swim before.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.243
Why would he swim?

00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:44.339
He's just calm, he's hanging out, huh?

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:48.823
Well, it seems like the Ruffians are a bit unsure.

00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:56.830
But, I don't know, I was thinking, you know, it seems like maybe he was planning to do some serious swimming with that swim cap on.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.350
Right!

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:03.235
But maybe, you know, the calmness of the water kinda got to him and made him change his plans.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:08.578
But I feel like if he wants to just float then, he should probably get out of there, right?

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:13.261
That area is reserved for the people that are zooming back and forth, right?

00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:14.421
Doing all the swimming.

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:17.803
Yeah... It's pretty nasty to be there, huh?

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:28.568
He's in the way, yeah... Yeah, I do think it's probably for the best you know, that you decided to do your swim far away from him, okay?

00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:32.450
Yeah, you know... Yeah, he's taking up the lane, huh?

00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:35.153
He's nasty.

00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:37.356
You don't know what he could do.

00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:41.179
Swim far away, okay?

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:42.961
Swim away.

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:45.764
BAU BAU!

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:46.545
Avoid.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:49.247
Aquatic Predator Pero!

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:50.388
I don't know.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:51.850
He's polluting the water.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.613
Yeah, he's nasty, so... Avoid.

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:57.015
Pollution Pero.

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:58.263
BAU BAU!

00:09:58.283 --> 00:09:58.904
Well, well, well!

00:09:58.944 --> 00:10:00.525
There's been some big news!

00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:04.287
Nanashi Ume-senpai from hololive Promise has hit 1 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:21.157

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:10:36.494 --> 00:10:38.976
You know, we were stuck in Power World.

00:10:39.136 --> 00:10:40.536
It's too bad!

00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:42.217
You know, but!

00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:42.738
But!

00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:48.441
Let's all say a big, big congratulations to Mumei-senpai, okay?

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:50.902
This is absolutely huge.

00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:52.223
It's huge!

00:10:52.243 --> 00:10:52.403
Huge!

00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:54.344
Congratulations!

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.506
BAU BAU!

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:59.407
BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:02.669
And we'll work hard to get them too one day.

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:03.590
One day!

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:07.252
BAU BAU!

00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:08.835
Such happy news, right?

00:11:08.995 --> 00:11:09.576
Right!

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:19.339
Congratulations, congratulations, alright!

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.141
BAU BAU!

00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.464
Well, also very happy news!

00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:36.311
Well, on Wednesday, FUWAMOCO made an appearance on the official hololive English channel and together with Ino-senpai!

00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:37.092
Senpai!

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:39.193
Ino-senbei!

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:41.535
Paco-senbei!

00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:49.323
Tako-senbei!

00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:49.883
Makes sense.

00:11:49.983 --> 00:11:52.525
Are you just thinking about food right now?

00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:57.188
Hungry straight from the morning, we have to have breakfast.

00:11:57.208 --> 00:12:06.675
I don't know, I guess you know the way you make tako-senbei is you have to put the tako through the machine that makes it fly.

00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:10.098
I think Ina-senpai would probably go through it pretty easily, right?

00:12:12.386 --> 00:12:15.368
FUWAMOCO and Ina-senpai.

00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:18.830
Not Ina-senpai, Ina-senpai.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.513
We're together as Ina-senpai and Bey-senpai.

00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:32.419
We revealed the key visuals for this year's big hololive expo and fanfest!

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.721
BAU BAU!

00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:36.862
Did you think of the Ruffians?

00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:44.851
Cute!

00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:45.692
Cute!

00:12:45.772 --> 00:12:52.102
This year's outfits are super cute aloha-style polo shirts with high-waisted shorts.

00:12:56.162 --> 00:13:03.425
And of course, you know, Moco-chan and I are matching and we're ready to make a diary of all our memories.

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:10.308
But more surprisingly, Pero is there with us in all of Advent for the photo too!

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:12.950
Surprising, huh, Ruffians?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:23.134
Yeah, you know, and I know a lot of Ruffians pointed it out, but it kind of looks like we're being pretty nice to Pero there too, huh?

00:13:23.494 --> 00:13:24.915
Well, you know,

00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:29.086
That was just for the photo, you know.

00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:30.969
We can't be mean in a photo.

00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:36.174
And he's holding the balloon string for a reason, Fuwako.

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:42.356
But I guess we're glad that he was included.

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:46.877
You know, he probably doesn't even realize how lucky he is.

00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:49.478
You know, the nasty guy.

00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:55.760
But we really can't wait until X was here and then we can make a lot of memories together!

00:13:57.301 --> 00:14:07.968
And also, there was the expo visual, but there was also the stunning 3 key visuals for Pithfest as well!

00:14:08.108 --> 00:14:11.190
What did you think, Ruffians?!

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.911
You didn't take your breath away!

00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.552
I sure did for eyes.

00:14:14.732 --> 00:14:17.634
Yeah, eyes senpai look angelic and bright.

00:14:18.994 --> 00:14:21.175
Right!

00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:24.896
And there's three of them, so if you haven't seen them, go check them out!

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:25.276
Okay?

00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:26.196
It's just one.

00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:38.900
Yeah, you know, each visual for each stage is so exciting and just... You can't help but imagine what's gonna happen, so... You really won't want to miss a single one for sure.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.780
Okay?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.120
Ruffians.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.841
Will you be going to see Fashion Person at FUWAMOCO Party?

00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.462
Or are you gonna be enjoying it from your home?

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.600
Hey!

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.221
Maybe even having a watch party together with other Ruffians!

00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:53.721
Oh!

00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:54.901
Even better!

00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:56.401
You'll be there!

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.782
Embracing from home!

00:14:58.842 --> 00:14:59.702
Going to fest!

00:14:59.802 --> 00:14:59.842
Oh!

00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:02.902
But you can have a watch party with all your friends too!

00:15:03.063 --> 00:15:04.243
Oh, you have a venue ticket?

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:05.763
Cool!

00:15:05.783 --> 00:15:05.843
Yes!

00:15:06.343 --> 00:15:07.723
Don't forget your ticket.

00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:08.123
Okay, bye!

00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:09.344
You have no friends!

00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:10.024
Are you kidding?

00:15:10.064 --> 00:15:11.704
You have other Ruffians!

00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:12.024
Yeah!

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:14.044
The Ruffians are your friends, okay?

00:15:14.324 --> 00:15:15.345
Okay, I'm going!

00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:16.125
BAU BAU!

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:19.526
Okay, got it.

00:15:19.566 --> 00:15:20.948
Ruffians are your friends.

00:15:20.968 --> 00:15:23.009
I decided that.

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.072
Yes, really.

00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:27.072
Yes.

00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:28.273
Okay.

00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:34.358
But we really can't wait until Expo visits us.

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:35.839
Yeah, we really hope that.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:43.726
You know, you're looking forward to it just as much as we are because, oh my goodness, March is gonna be fun.

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:45.087
BAU BAU!

00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:48.669
It's gonna be crazy!

00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:50.471
You have friends now, you do!

00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:51.011
You do!

00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:52.433
Okay.

00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:54.355
I told you, you do.

00:15:54.796 --> 00:15:55.697
Yeah.

00:15:56.297 --> 00:15:57.939
And that's- I'm always right.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.621
That's the decision.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.645
BAU BAU!

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:14.819
Well, Ruffians, we also saw this the other day on Twitter and we just couldn't stop thinking about it!

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:15.700
I couldn't.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.141
Have you seen this?

00:16:18.442 --> 00:16:19.202
Ruffians!

00:16:20.003 --> 00:16:22.365
Well, it's FUWAMOCO 64!

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:25.667
And 64 kills!

00:16:25.707 --> 00:16:26.127
Right!

00:16:26.187 --> 00:16:27.408
It's perfect!

00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:29.249
This is exactly what...

00:16:41.923 --> 00:16:46.484
And you know right now, it's just a video, so it's not an actual game.

00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:10.658
Giving gifts like this is absolutely amazing!

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:11.538
I know.

00:17:11.858 --> 00:17:15.981
We'd love to see something come together in an actual game one day!

00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:17.001
Maybe!

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:18.042
Yeah.

00:17:18.802 --> 00:17:23.324
I wonder though, what kind of enemies would there be or NPCs to interact with?

00:17:23.404 --> 00:17:26.926
What kind of quests would there be?

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:27.126
Right!

00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:35.651
Do you think the other Advent members, do you think they'd be NPCs to talk to us, or... How about the boys?

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.942
BAU BAU!

00:17:44.442 --> 00:17:47.264
There's so much life stuff, right?

00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:50.246
The ideas are limitless.

00:17:50.467 --> 00:17:52.388
Thank you so much!

00:17:52.428 --> 00:17:55.310
Can you play as Fuwawa too?

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.931
Yeah, I think you should.

00:17:57.051 --> 00:17:59.013
You know what type of player?

00:17:59.053 --> 00:18:00.794
You can tag team and switch out.

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:03.556
High five, switch out!

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:04.236
Thank you!

00:18:04.556 --> 00:18:05.417
BAU BAU!

00:18:05.497 --> 00:18:08.319
So amazing, creative, thank you!

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:10.260
BAU BAU!

00:18:12.515 --> 00:18:14.877
Let's take a look at it!

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:17.938
Wow, Ruffians!

00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:41.879
Marine Senchou Senpai, you know how she just recently reached 3 million subscribers, right?

00:18:41.899 --> 00:18:42.619
Crazy.

00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:44.541
That's amazing!

00:18:44.841 --> 00:18:45.601
Right!

00:18:45.622 --> 00:18:56.649
3 million... Well, you know, she promised that if she reaches 3 million, then she'd share something deeply embarrassing from her past.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.953
A game that she made while she was still a middle schooler.

00:19:01.993 --> 00:19:02.874
Yeah, that's...

00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:04.440
That's the thing.

00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:06.764
It's pretty embarrassing, I guess.

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:07.786
In theory, yeah.

00:19:10.762 --> 00:19:12.003
Did you hear, Ruffians?

00:19:12.683 --> 00:19:14.584
Yes, she got famous!

00:19:14.824 --> 00:19:15.564
Yeah!

00:19:15.584 --> 00:19:19.165
Yeah, well the game is titled Second World.

00:19:19.486 --> 00:19:24.127
And apparently it's something that she worked on here and there in the past, you know, maybe.

00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:34.872
First as a manga, and then started making a RPG maker, but then she didn't get, I guess, further in it until she was once in hololive.

00:19:36.072 --> 00:19:39.714
Yeah, I don't know sharing something like this from

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:49.285
It sounds a bit rough, but it's definitely something you need to check out too, okay?

00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:57.031
Marine Senchou Senpai also did a stream recently where she shared it, but you can also download it and check it out yourself, okay?

00:19:58.312 --> 00:20:04.257
It's rather text-heavy though, so it might be hard if you aren't very confident in your Japanese.

00:20:04.697 --> 00:20:06.239
Right, really impressive.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:08.440
Dude, the FUWAMOCO has something...

00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:11.240
This is crazy.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.103
This is amazing, okay?

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:15.849
We don't need to talk about FUWAMOCO.

00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:17.151
This is amazing!

00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:17.753
You know it.

00:20:17.813 --> 00:20:18.975
Not those kind of things.

00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:22.816
But, you know, Ruffians!

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:29.978
Let's all congratulate Marine-senpai for sharing something so embarrassing and personal.

00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:30.938
Yeah!

00:20:31.358 --> 00:20:32.859
You know, that's amazing.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:38.700
We should say a big thank you too, so... BAU BAU!

00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:42.341
What did you do, Fuwamo?

00:20:42.381 --> 00:20:44.482
We didn't do anything, you know.

00:20:44.502 --> 00:20:47.503
I wish I did something as amazing as that.

00:20:48.383 --> 00:20:49.704
It's pretty amazing!

00:20:49.844 --> 00:20:50.044
I know.

00:20:52.268 --> 00:20:54.311
Well, Ruffians!

00:20:56.414 --> 00:21:00.200
We also have a bit of a confession maybe that we should make.

00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:09.270
Well, it doesn't have to do with any of the things that we made in the past, you know.

00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:17.760
But, well, recently, you know, we've been kind of trying to figure out what we should watch while we quickly eat our meals.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.865
Because, you know, it's kind of nice to check up on what new anime there is, but...

00:21:22.557 --> 00:21:26.501
But sometimes it's hard to watch an episode of anime, you know?

00:21:26.542 --> 00:21:29.465
You have to start, stop, start, stop, you know?

00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.526
Doesn't really work.

00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:31.787
Yeah.

00:21:32.028 --> 00:21:38.635
So, recently, we started watching episodes of GameCenter CX again!

00:21:39.296 --> 00:21:39.997
Have you heard?

00:21:40.357 --> 00:21:41.478
Have you heard of it, Ruffians?

00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:52.237
It's a show where a comedian, Arino, from the duo Yoiko, he plays retro games, he tries to beat them up, showing just what makes them so special.

00:21:52.657 --> 00:21:56.079
It's really funny and interesting. We've been able to learn a lot too.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.520
Yeah, you love it?

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:58.660
Yeah!

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:58.901
It's so fun!

00:21:58.921 --> 00:21:59.541
You haven't watched it, huh?

00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:00.182
You haven't?

00:22:00.202 --> 00:22:00.842
It's fun, though!

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:01.543
But, Ruffians.

00:22:01.563 --> 00:22:02.183
A confession.

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:33.161
Yeah, you know... FUWAMOCO is like shouting at the TV a little, but... Of course in the most politest way possible, right?

00:22:33.481 --> 00:22:34.522
Yeah!

00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:35.203
Yeah.

00:22:35.223 --> 00:22:37.705
Can you believe that?

00:22:39.266 --> 00:22:39.626
Right?

00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:48.314
Yeah, you know, uh... I don't know, FUWAMOCO, somehow we kinda... We kinda maybe... Think we have the authority to boss them around.

00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:48.794
Do we?

00:22:48.854 --> 00:22:50.376
I think it just happens, huh?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.222
You know he's Mocoto, right?

00:22:54.823 --> 00:23:01.428
And you know, especially when you just saw that in the Just Have Fun category of gamers.

00:23:02.349 --> 00:23:02.730
Right.

00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:05.012
Yep, we saw.

00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.802
You think we have the authority?

00:23:07.882 --> 00:23:08.062
Really?

00:23:08.082 --> 00:23:09.743
Did you see the Mario Kart?

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:10.703
My god that jump!

00:23:10.763 --> 00:23:10.963
Jump!

00:23:11.003 --> 00:23:11.904
What are you doing?

00:23:28.973 --> 00:23:29.814
BAU BAU!

00:23:30.134 --> 00:23:31.355
BAU BAU!

00:23:31.435 --> 00:23:32.637
BAU BAU!

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:33.498
BAU BAU!

00:23:49.193 --> 00:23:56.360
My Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:58.663
It's Spike!

00:23:58.763 --> 00:23:59.724
He's tiny!

00:23:59.764 --> 00:24:01.265
The puppy of puppies!

00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:04.769
Spike, you know, he's just a little fluffy.

00:24:05.249 --> 00:24:06.029
BAU!

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:08.770
So cute!

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:16.393
He's only just two months old and he really likes to eat and sleep and play.

00:24:16.694 --> 00:24:19.795
He's two months old!

00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:21.936
He's just like you!

00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:23.396
You're two months old!

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:26.077
Is this our youngest Doggie of the Day?

00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:27.398
I think so!

00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:30.439
I think so, right, Ruffians?

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.060
You're gonna steal him!

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.180
Oh no, watch out!

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.841
He smells so sweet!

00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:36.582
I bet he does too.

00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:39.844
Very cute!

00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:44.887
How does Mike BAU BAU?

00:24:45.507 --> 00:24:47.688
Not see you, Space Cowboy!

00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:48.249
What?

00:24:50.263 --> 00:24:50.944
What?

00:24:51.044 --> 00:24:53.586
That's not how he BAU BAUs.

00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:54.706
That's not what he does!

00:24:55.087 --> 00:24:57.589
BAU and see a space cowboy BAU BAU.

00:24:57.609 --> 00:25:00.210
That's not what he says, okay?

00:25:00.331 --> 00:25:02.112
He's two months old.

00:25:02.212 --> 00:25:02.532
Yeah.

00:25:02.732 --> 00:25:05.714
He probably... BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:06.015 --> 00:25:07.896
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:10.378
But he's a bit unsure.

00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:12.680
He's just learning how to use the barker still.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.620
The barker, yeah.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.961
Maybe sometimes I bark.

00:25:15.562 --> 00:25:15.822
BAU.

00:25:16.142 --> 00:25:16.242
BAU.

00:25:18.936 --> 00:25:19.997
How big is he now?

00:25:42.569 --> 00:25:44.651
I think he's gonna be a big puppy one day.

00:25:44.951 --> 00:25:47.714
I think the Ruffians want updates, huh?

00:25:48.575 --> 00:25:57.182
Well, you know, you say that his favorite things are sleeping and eating and playing, but you missed actually, you missed one important one.

00:25:59.064 --> 00:25:59.785
Do you know what it is?

00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:01.475
You!

00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:02.996
Yeah, it's you!

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.137
Spike loves you!

00:26:05.157 --> 00:26:08.219
BAU BAU!

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:09.120
BAU BAU!

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.400
Biting things?

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.701
I guess that one too.

00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:12.542
I guess.

00:26:12.582 --> 00:26:14.803
That goes in the playing category, no?

00:26:14.903 --> 00:26:15.243
Does it?

00:26:15.263 --> 00:26:16.104
I think so.

00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:17.685
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:19.105
BAU BAU!

00:26:19.446 --> 00:26:22.187
Well, let's check what Ruffians are doing on walks.

00:26:22.828 --> 00:26:28.251
Well, today's... Today's the day I lay out on a walk is...

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:29.588
De-den!

00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:33.572
It's so pretty!

00:26:33.652 --> 00:26:35.434
A beautiful day!

00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:39.458
The water bank is flowing over!

00:26:39.478 --> 00:26:42.942
That must have been a lot of rain.

00:26:43.342 --> 00:26:44.183
It looks so nice.

00:26:44.223 --> 00:26:46.506
You wouldn't think it has rained recently, huh?

00:26:47.651 --> 00:26:53.052
We hope you had an amazing walk and that your shoes didn't get soggy or anything.

00:26:53.073 --> 00:26:54.193
BAU BAU!

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:57.214
Kinda scary, you have to be careful.

00:26:57.374 --> 00:26:58.874
No soggy.

00:27:06.718 --> 00:27:07.539
BAU BAU!

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:12.602
And for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

00:27:12.783 --> 00:27:13.723
Hello!

00:27:14.364 --> 00:27:15.925
Hello!

00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:21.049
It's always nice to see how you two get along, and how warm you are to each other.

00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.870
Of course!

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:27.454
Was there ever a time when you didn't get along, or have you always been friends?

00:27:29.275 --> 00:27:33.658
A time when we didn't get along... What do you think, Ruffians?

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:34.739
Huh?

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.722
Well, you know... Don't worry about it, that's one thing.

00:27:45.822 --> 00:27:46.143
What?

00:27:46.163 --> 00:27:48.323
Married from birth?

00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:54.685
But you know, you see siblings, they do grow through phases, I think.

00:27:55.246 --> 00:27:57.706
But we've always been close, you know?

00:27:57.746 --> 00:28:00.927
Never like a... Kind of one way or the other.

00:28:04.203 --> 00:28:12.887
You know, I think we've just been very, very thankful to have a good friend and a wonderful sister by our side for a long time, right?

00:28:12.947 --> 00:28:13.527
Always.

00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:14.728
Right, Moco-chan?

00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:15.968
Over 2,000 years!

00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:16.808
Huh?

00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:18.209
Yeah.

00:28:18.569 --> 00:28:18.769
Yeah?

00:28:19.129 --> 00:28:19.810
Yeah, of course.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.911
You didn't answer me so I was worried a bit.

00:28:22.971 --> 00:28:23.671
I forgot.

00:28:23.691 --> 00:28:25.012
I wasn't listening.

00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:27.373
BAU BAU!

00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:28.673
BAU BAU!

00:28:28.693 --> 00:28:30.634
Maybe that's the key to a good friendship.

00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:32.395
Don't listen all the time.

00:28:34.812 --> 00:28:35.412
Baby.

00:28:35.552 --> 00:28:36.172
BAU BAU.

00:28:36.293 --> 00:28:36.953
BAU BAU!

00:28:36.993 --> 00:28:42.934
For our next stream coming up, we have... De-den!

00:28:43.174 --> 00:28:44.115
Our collab!

00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:46.615
Our weekly collab together with Advent.

00:28:47.035 --> 00:28:49.956
This time we're not playing anything happy like Tall World.

00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:52.877
We're heading into the back rooms.

00:28:52.937 --> 00:28:56.178
We're playing inside the back rooms.

00:28:57.138 --> 00:28:58.498
Yeah.

00:29:00.099 --> 00:29:00.439
Yeah.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:08.685
Ruffians, we're really hoping that we don't find anything too scary and that we can find, I guess, the exit pretty fast.

00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:12.908
Go inside the bathrooms, go outside the bathrooms, that kind of thing.

00:29:12.928 --> 00:29:14.509
Oh yeah.

00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:19.992
I hope there's no one lurking in the darkness who would like to be the sixth member of Advent, huh?

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:23.695
I definitely don't see anybody there in the thumbnail, I thought right.

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:25.456
Yeah.

00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:27.365
Yeah.

00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:29.086
It's a room, but it's in the back.

00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:30.186
That makes sense.

00:29:30.286 --> 00:29:31.206
It's the back room.

00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:33.687
BAU BAU!

00:29:34.047 --> 00:29:35.147
Not the bathroom.

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:36.947
Not the bathroom!

00:29:37.007 --> 00:29:38.467
The back room.

00:29:39.848 --> 00:29:40.048
No!

00:29:40.068 --> 00:29:41.928
I'm not going inside the bathroom.

00:29:42.008 --> 00:29:43.749
Would you rather go to the back room?

00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:49.770
Moco-chan, you could ask me, would I rather go inside the bathroom?

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.290
I'm not gonna ask.

00:29:53.871 --> 00:29:55.291
I don't know which one's spookier.

00:29:57.625 --> 00:29:57.985
BAU BAU!

00:30:06.407 --> 00:30:11.371
This weekend we're playing Metal Gear Solid 2!

00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:19.857
We're playing it from the very beginning on our PS2 because it's Metal Gear Solid 2.

00:30:28.223 --> 00:30:29.603
I'm really excited!

00:30:29.623 --> 00:30:34.524
We can't wait to see what it's like now that we've upgraded from PS1 to PS2.

00:30:34.845 --> 00:30:36.805
Right!

00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:39.666
Right, you excited?

00:30:39.846 --> 00:30:40.706
I'm excited!

00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:53.249
And, it's not there, but I, in a while now, just under a week, there's a... Something that's not Metal Gear Solid 2, huh?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.941
BAU BAU!

00:31:13.012 --> 00:31:20.075
But first, Ruffians, we wanted to say thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:28.719
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:29.239

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:24.188
