00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.229
Hello, hello, Happy holo Year!

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:38.550
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:42.992
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:46.473
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:48.334
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:51.955
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:54.896
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:56.997
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:57.017 --> 00:05:59.178
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:04.181
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:06.122
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:09.984
Thank you for joining us today for the 62nd episode.

00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:12.765
And our first episode of 2024!

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:13.505
BAU BAU!

00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:18.388
I definitely didn't say Happy Halloween.

00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:24.060
I was like, Moco-chan, what did you just say?

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.702
I definitely did not say Happy Halloween.

00:06:28.302 --> 00:06:29.723
Happy New Year.

00:06:30.483 --> 00:06:31.444
You didn't hear anything.

00:06:32.924 --> 00:06:34.525
No, you didn't hear anything, no.

00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:35.606
BAU BAU!

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:38.127
BAU BAU!

00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:43.670
Well, let's have a very, very happy start to our New Year, Ruffians.

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:51.770
Maybe, you know, your New Year's resolution is to wake up every day for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.891
That would be pretty cool.

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:57.595
That would be cool, but just so there's no misunderstanding.

00:06:57.695 --> 00:06:59.136
No misunderstandings!

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:06.322
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:08.024
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:10.246
And it's hosted by us.

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:12.367
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:18.673
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:28.181
So, a way to start on the right paw is to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.944
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:36.368
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:37.228
BAU BAU!

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:38.970
Why?

00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:43.834
Well, it's a new year.

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:44.574
New year?

00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:48.357
Do we have something new and exciting, Moco-chan?

00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:51.199
New year, new Pero Sighting.

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:52.961
Pero Sighting?

00:07:52.981 --> 00:07:54.982
Do we have to start the new year this way?

00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:58.945
I don't know.

00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:05.791
Ruffians submitted it, so... I mean, we are asking for sightings of peros, so...

00:08:07.213 --> 00:08:08.674
Is it a good Pero Sighting?

00:08:28.158 --> 00:08:31.519
If you look at the left side and the right side of the picture, it's good.

00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:36.560
Well, we love mitarashi dango, so it's good in that way.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.722
I'll have the one on the left and Moco-chan, you can have the one on the right.

00:08:43.242 --> 00:08:48.903
Ruffians, I think maybe it's for the best if you don't eat the one in the middle.

00:08:53.624 --> 00:08:59.468
I don't want to think too hard about what my eyes are seeing and what my brain is feeling.

00:09:00.048 --> 00:09:03.491
This is just a lot going on there.

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.994
Instead, I'm just going to look at how delicious the other dango looks right there.

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.576
How does it look?

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:14.038
Pero has his bones.

00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:24.185
But, you know, I feel like this mitarashi dango here looks so delicious.

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:30.848
That maybe we might get a little bit carried away and poke ourselves there.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:32.849
We gotta be careful, you know!

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:34.829
Ruffians, have you had mitarashi dango before?

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:35.630
It's not marshmallows.

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:42.453
No, not marshmallows.

00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:49.518
Mitarashi dango is like a... Mitarashi sauce is like a sweet, but savory sweet sauce-based sauce.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:53.782
It might take a little bit of time to get used to, but it's really yummy.

00:09:53.922 --> 00:09:57.564
And then you have the dango, it's kind of like mochi, but not.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:59.366
It's dango.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:00.627
It's different.

00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:01.608
It's very yummy, though.

00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:02.688
Very yummy?

00:10:02.989 --> 00:10:03.689
My favorite.

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:08.793
But you know, let's make sure to have lots of yummy food this New Year season, too!

00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:14.433
I might have had a lot of yummy food during the holidays too.

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:15.213
Christmas.

00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:16.353
But now it's New Year.

00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:18.214
So... New Year food.

00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:19.675
Another excuse for yummy food, huh?

00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:23.396
BAU BAU!

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:25.277
Let's just forget about Peronia.

00:10:25.677 --> 00:10:27.558
No nasties in the New Year.

00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:27.938
No!

00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:31.480
BAU BAU!

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.422
Now I'm extra hungry.

00:10:35.742 --> 00:10:38.363
Well, speaking of the New Year...

00:10:39.082 --> 00:10:39.882
Oh!

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:41.403
Wow, Ruffians.

00:10:42.343 --> 00:10:45.644
Like we said, it's now officially the new year everywhere!

00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:48.505
New year everywhere, you know?

00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:54.846
And so, it's the season to welcome the year with... Boys Pudge!

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:57.287
BAU BAU!

00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:03.909
I think, you know, Ruffians, you enjoyed our end of the year holiday theme, right?

00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:12.753
Well, I think it was a bit heart-pumping for you, just like it was for us, right?

00:11:13.753 --> 00:11:21.559
Yeah, well, now this is the perfect time to listen to the beginning of the year holiday voice chat too, you know?

00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:21.879
Right?

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:27.283
You know, it's a fun time of year, lots to do together, you know?

00:11:27.803 --> 00:11:33.327
Cooking, maybe some cleaning, or even just, you know, taking it

00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:38.619
Easy together, maybe watching anime, playing games, those kind of things.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:46.703
Maybe you'll have to listen to our beginning of the year voice packs to find out.

00:11:57.108 --> 00:12:01.169
I can't wait for the English and Japanese versions!

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:17.754
It was a lot of fun.

00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:23.318
We had a lot of fun, you know, so we hope that you enjoyed them just as much as we did.

00:12:23.978 --> 00:12:25.559
BAU BAU!

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.300
Thank you, our friends!

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.282
Speaking of Japanese...

00:12:40.874 --> 00:12:45.477
We had a bit of fun these past few days, Ruffians, you know.

00:12:45.797 --> 00:12:59.707
Actually, as a part of some of the end-of-the-year festivities, we were invited to participate in the Yukuhoro Kuruhoro New Year's programming during the Toridaka Taisho!

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:01.488
Toridaka Taisho!

00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:07.852
You know, we participated along with our senpai, and we watched a bunch of the best moments of the year for hololive!

00:13:09.293 --> 00:13:14.139
You know, the clip that was crowned the Grand Prix.

00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:17.464
It was something else, huh?

00:13:17.644 --> 00:13:18.986
Something else.

00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:20.487
A lot of chaos.

00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:22.470
A lot of amazing clips, right!

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.332
NPC Nenechi.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:25.434
Right.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:38.771
Yeah, but you know, not just the Toredaka Taisho group, we also formed into AyaHobomi to the 3D Toon New Future!

00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:40.472
I wasn't envious, no.

00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:41.293
Right!

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:45.877
We all got to eat Osechi, a traditional Japanese New Year's food.

00:13:46.057 --> 00:13:47.058
Yeah, a bit fancy.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:50.060
Yeah, we had kamaboko fish cakes,

00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:53.762
Black beans.

00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:57.161
We talked a bunch about our hopes for the new year too!

00:14:11.148 --> 00:14:12.889
We're really happy.

00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:15.329
It was definitely a fun start to the new year!

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:23.972
We're just really thankful to be able to participate on these programs and we hope that we'll get invited more in the future too!

00:14:24.192 --> 00:14:24.992
BAU BAU!

00:14:28.633 --> 00:14:30.334
Although, I still want to try.

00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:37.616
Because I talked about trying ikura, and kazunoko, and umibudo.

00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:39.136
All at once!

00:14:39.236 --> 00:14:40.936
Sea grapes.

00:14:41.237 --> 00:14:41.757
Sea grapes.

00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:42.537
Let's call it that.

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:48.639
You know, you want ASMR, right, Ruffians?

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:49.819
What about it?

00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:52.380
That type of ASMR.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.260
That's what Fubuki-senpai was suggesting, right?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.701
Because they all sound very...

00:14:57.725 --> 00:14:58.205
Popping.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:14:58.845
Popping.

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.406
Popping seafood.

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:04.087
Huh?

00:15:04.127 --> 00:15:04.547
Yes!

00:15:04.607 --> 00:15:09.249
I was expecting you to say no!

00:15:10.929 --> 00:15:12.170
Seafood ASMR?

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:14.999
You're weird.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.703
BAU BAU!

00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:26.947
You know, we had a lot of New Year's fun, but with the New Year's also comes some new things, too.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:32.691
And over at the hololive reddit, there's been some updates.

00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:34.192
Some changes.

00:15:34.252 --> 00:15:35.593
The changes, yeah.

00:15:35.993 --> 00:15:43.238
You know, now, Ruffians, you can select us and the other advent members as your OSHA icons!

00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:45.119
You know, I don't really get it.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.884
Apparently, it's a bit tricky to select both of us as your... A flair?

00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:54.087
Not flair senpai, but a flair.

00:15:54.227 --> 00:15:55.108
Oshi-aikon.

00:15:55.748 --> 00:15:56.489
Is it different?

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.970
Oshi-aikon.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.751
Let's go with that.

00:15:58.851 --> 00:15:59.812
Okay.

00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:07.038
But apparently, to be able to have both of us as your oshi-aikon, you have to select Yagoo-san first.

00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:10.261
And then, you can select both of us.

00:16:11.297 --> 00:16:15.860
I don't really get it, but there's some kind of Ruffians that will definitely help you, okay?

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.262
I wonder why you have to ask YAGOO-san for permission first.

00:16:20.683 --> 00:16:21.223
I don't know!

00:16:21.844 --> 00:16:23.985
You'll have to ask him, okay?

00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.767
But we hope that you'll pick us as your ushi on Reddit too!

00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:30.629
I definitely, definitely never notice them.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:31.250
Why?

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.091
Never, ever looking.

00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:36.413
No, definitely not.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:41.576
Then Biboo and Hana-senpai?

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.478
When's FUWAMOCO's turn?

00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:46.122
Right?

00:16:47.703 --> 00:16:51.947
But now, FUWAMOCO, we have BAU BAU stickers by me too!

00:16:52.107 --> 00:16:57.232
I don't know if it's any different, but now maybe you can notice when it's actually us.

00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:59.695
When we respond to your comment.

00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:03.953
No, it's not a fake FUWAMOCO.

00:17:04.113 --> 00:17:05.655
No, it's ice.

00:17:05.755 --> 00:17:08.897
It's FUWAMOCO, Fuwawa, and Mococo.

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:10.999
No fake FUWAMOCO.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.701
It's ice.

00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:23.249
We hope to be able to have even more fun here on Reddit and, you know, enjoy hololive all together over there in 2024 too!

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:24.410
I don't get it too.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.012
But, don't think, just jump.

00:17:27.632 --> 00:17:27.952
BAU BAU!

00:17:33.092 --> 00:17:41.559
Well, Ruffians, you know the new year, it's a time for maybe channeling luck?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.621
Yeah, noon to noon.

00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:53.169
And, well, Ruffians, I was wondering, do you have anything particularly lucky that brings you good luck throughout the day?

00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:54.390
You know,

00:17:56.329 --> 00:18:02.231
A special mug or a necklace or maybe a shirt.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.791
Some sort of lucky item.

00:18:04.332 --> 00:18:06.252
Those kind of things.

00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:08.473
Not at all!

00:18:08.493 --> 00:18:11.514
FUWAMOCO is your lucky charm!

00:18:12.234 --> 00:18:14.595
You say that, it's gonna make us blush.

00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:15.915
What are you doing?

00:18:15.935 --> 00:18:16.595
It's the morning.

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:19.396
Wristwatch!

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:24.538
I guess Ruffians don't really have lucky items.

00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:25.218
We're the only...

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:30.002
Wow, I couldn't have given you other gifts, huh?

00:18:30.062 --> 00:18:35.488
Well, though, actually, Fuwawa me, I have something like that!

00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:47.294
I never said anything, but actually, a while ago, I came across a shirt that brought me a lot of luck.

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:47.975
A shirt!

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:48.656
A shirt!

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:49.857
Is it Mococo?

00:18:49.937 --> 00:18:50.237
No!

00:18:50.257 --> 00:18:51.018
I am not a shirt!

00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:52.039
You're not a shirt?

00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:52.899
I'm Mococo!

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.082
Well, the story is, you know, one day,

00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:05.086
We were looking through some previously loved clothes in the Northwest Passage.

00:19:05.706 --> 00:19:12.168
And randomly, I came across a shirt that had Gura-senpai on it!

00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:13.128
Why?

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:13.988
Why?

00:19:14.368 --> 00:19:15.128
Pretty lucky.

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:16.029
Why?

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:25.791
Ever since then, you know, whenever I kind of wanted extra good luck before, you know, like, auditions or something like that, you know,

00:19:26.903 --> 00:19:35.849
Even debut, I wore it as a pajama shirt the night before, and then that way, I could get some extra love.

00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:39.131
Ruffians, you know what?

00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:40.672
I think it worked!

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.713
Kuro-senpai's luck!

00:19:43.513 --> 00:19:55.421
You know, it's a very special lucky item of mine that has helped give me a little power during times where I really needed it, so I'm very thankful.

00:19:57.849 --> 00:19:59.952
Would you like something like that too, Ruffians?

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:04.099
Head pads!

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:07.183
If you don't wash it.

00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:07.684
I wash it.

00:20:12.614 --> 00:20:13.935
That sounded suspicious.

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:19.501
I do wash it, I do wash it.

00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:21.182
That's normal, okay?

00:20:21.202 --> 00:20:23.664
That sounded very suspicious though.

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:33.093
But you know, I really hope that maybe there's still some more luck attached to it.

00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:36.216
If I wear it some more, maybe...

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.071
Gura-senpai morning!

00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:46.940
After all, one of our goals this year is to get to know our senpai better too, right?

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:52.341
Now hopefully, now that we're out of the holiday time, maybe we'll have some more time.

00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:52.801
Right!

00:20:52.861 --> 00:20:54.962
Do some more collabs.

00:20:55.562 --> 00:20:57.103
BAU BAU!

00:20:57.123 --> 00:21:01.245
I hope Ruffians, you can find your lucky items.

00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:03.446
BAU BAU!

00:21:03.886 --> 00:21:11.210
Well, we actually have some FUWAMOCO scoops from some Ruffians.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.032
Thank you for the very good channels, Ruffians.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.973
Our first group, yeah!

00:21:18.013 --> 00:21:24.228
Our first group for today we have... Ruffians.

00:21:25.578 --> 00:21:26.859
Did you hear about this?

00:21:28.199 --> 00:21:38.645
Just the other day, Kiara-senpai and Ina-senpai did a special stream where they created their own interpretation of some casual clothing outfits for everyone.

00:21:38.785 --> 00:21:39.785
It was so cute!

00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:41.846
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:43.327
You were there!

00:21:43.347 --> 00:21:46.629
Did you enjoy the designs?

00:21:46.749 --> 00:21:49.110
They were all so cute!

00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:56.154
You know, it really, really showcased Kiara-senpai, Ina-senpai's personality.

00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:56.735
Right!

00:21:56.755 --> 00:21:57.775
It's wonderful too.

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:58.956
Yeah.

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:06.902
However though, when it came to Shiori's design, she kinda had something to say.

00:22:06.922 --> 00:22:07.002
Yeah.

00:22:10.304 --> 00:22:20.351
She wasn't too impressed with, you know, her tummy showing and kinda called Moco-chan, uh, shameless for showing hers.

00:22:21.926 --> 00:22:23.687
Moco-chan, do you have anything to say?

00:22:23.707 --> 00:22:26.369
Shiori.

00:22:27.689 --> 00:22:28.610
Shiori!

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.591
You know me.

00:22:31.932 --> 00:22:33.313
I'm not shameless!

00:22:34.393 --> 00:22:47.101
You know, I... I just... tend to get a bit quiet sometimes, so... You know, keeping a tummy cool makes it a happy tummy, right?

00:22:50.262 --> 00:22:50.783
Ruffians!

00:22:51.994 --> 00:22:53.175
You agree, right?

00:22:53.715 --> 00:22:55.136
That sounds like an excuse.

00:22:55.357 --> 00:22:55.977
No!

00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:58.079
I'm not shameless, okay?

00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:00.100
That sounds like an excuse, yeah.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.362
It's out of practicality.

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:09.727
It doesn't matter because... My tummy is cute, right?

00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:17.513
So it's okay, right?

00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:24.071
It's not seamless, okay?

00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:25.192
It's practical.

00:23:26.413 --> 00:23:29.235
No, I think it's seamless.

00:23:29.475 --> 00:23:30.416
No!

00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:34.640
My own system.

00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.362
Moco-chan, what do you propose?

00:23:38.263 --> 00:23:40.945
I think Shiori should apologize.

00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:42.246
Shiori!

00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:46.030
I'm waiting for your apology, Shiori!

00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:49.373
BAU BAU!

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.792
Thank you for the scoop, Ruffians.

00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:56.213
Thank you for telling me about the horrible things Shiori said.

00:23:56.814 --> 00:23:58.234
Ah, that's terrible.

00:23:58.774 --> 00:23:59.674
That's rough.

00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:01.155
Wow.

00:24:01.635 --> 00:24:04.436
There's been some more scoops, too.

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:05.716
Hopefully better ones.

00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:07.356
Hopefully better, yeah.

00:24:07.897 --> 00:24:08.897
Wow, wow.

00:24:09.317 --> 00:24:15.339
I think there was a senpai that had some extra, extra special luck recently.

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:17.999
Because... Wow.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.960
Hekora-senpai!

00:24:23.979 --> 00:24:27.371
She had some very good luck betting on horses.

00:24:29.088 --> 00:24:30.609
Arima Kimi.

00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:32.570
Really famous horse races in Japan.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.931
And you know what happened over Christmas?

00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:38.832
And I think a number of senpai decided to place some bets on horses today.

00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:43.154
I was a bit confused as to what senpai was doing.

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:45.175
But Pekora senpai, she won big!

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.477
She won over a million yen, over $10,000 American!

00:24:54.773 --> 00:24:56.434
That's pretty... That's pretty weird.

00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:59.007
That's amazing, right?

00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:00.448
That's crazy, right?

00:25:00.508 --> 00:25:03.109
Yeah, we don't really... It's normal?

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.970
Normal!

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:11.095
We don't really know anything about horse racing or gambling, but... We're happy for Pekora-senpai!

00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:16.278
Congratulations, Pekora-senpai!

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:21.742
You know, I think that maybe her betting luck is probably used up now, right?

00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:23.357
That's amazing, right

00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:27.046
She probably used all of 2024's luck too high.

00:25:27.086 --> 00:25:27.487
Probably.

00:25:27.507 --> 00:25:29.352
Why did you use the Ruffians?

00:25:30.447 --> 00:25:32.488
I don't know, I wonder about these things.

00:25:32.848 --> 00:25:33.229
I see.

00:25:33.249 --> 00:25:37.131
Maybe not.

00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:43.354
But you know, Mio-senpai was talking about buying New Year's fortune tickets for us too.

00:25:43.414 --> 00:25:43.734
Right!

00:25:43.754 --> 00:25:45.155
So we were happy.

00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:51.599
We were happy but... I think Mio-senpai could say, Oh, I'll do anything with FUWAMOCO and we'd be happy.

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:57.222
But yeah, you know, but more than fortune tickets, I think, you know, we just wanna

00:25:57.802 --> 00:25:58.162
BAU BAU!

00:25:58.182 --> 00:25:58.362
BAU BAU!

00:25:58.442 --> 00:25:59.823
It's that time of the week.

00:25:59.863 --> 00:26:01.483
It's a new year!

00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.304
A new week and a new challenge!

00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:03.544
Right!

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.690
Right!

00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:40.115
So, this week too, Moco-chan's gonna do her best to challenge and overcome her fear of natto!

00:26:40.296 --> 00:26:42.516
Yeah, we've been at this for a while.

00:26:42.536 --> 00:26:50.780
Ruffians, you know that natto is a type of breakfast food in Japan that consists of fermented soybeans.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.642
It's really healthy for you, but it's kind of something else.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.812
Moco-chan, you did really well with the sesame oil last time.

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:01.352
I did!

00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:01.653
I did!

00:27:01.793 --> 00:27:03.134
I've been doing well!

00:27:03.194 --> 00:27:07.436
That's why this time, I decided to go very minimal.

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:09.857
Very minimal.

00:27:10.058 --> 00:27:13.600
Do things the way that we started them.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.541
Because it's the start of a new year, right?

00:27:15.561 --> 00:27:17.922
Start of a new year, you know?

00:27:18.462 --> 00:27:19.143
And I think...

00:27:20.034 --> 00:27:25.857
Maybe Moco-chan, maybe this is more of like a... You kinda gotta just convince yourself that you can eat them!

00:27:26.997 --> 00:27:29.018
It's a part of the heart.

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:33.240
My heart has been wrong and that's why I haven't been able to eat it.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.401
Is that what you're saying?

00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:37.142
Well, that could be one thing.

00:27:38.343 --> 00:27:39.804
Okay, Moco-chan, you ready?

00:27:39.944 --> 00:27:42.845
Okay, I guess.

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:44.966
Do you have my favorite chopsticks?

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:45.606
No.

00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:51.443
It's another part you have to get over, Moco-chan.

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.144
Can I use chopsticks?

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:53.784
Is that okay?

00:27:53.804 --> 00:27:53.964
Yeah.

00:27:54.884 --> 00:27:55.785
Yeah.

00:27:56.805 --> 00:27:57.285
I'm allowed.

00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:58.506
I don't have to use my hands.

00:27:58.526 --> 00:27:58.566
No.

00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:03.287
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:28:03.407 --> 00:28:04.127
Thank you!

00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:05.908
Thank you!

00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:07.849
The natto.

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:11.110
It looks very... A little bit different.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.411
A bit different.

00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:16.892
It doesn't smell that much, does it?

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:19.797
I... I don't know.

00:28:19.817 --> 00:28:23.118
I'm sort of... I'm sort of confident today, I think.

00:28:23.158 --> 00:28:24.618
You know, it's New Year.

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:26.759
New life.

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:29.620
Mouthful you think.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.361
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:37.263
First, let's say thank you to the FUWAMOZUKONCHIGI who tried to make this okay.

00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:38.544
Itadakimasu!

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:40.964
Thank you very much!

00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:47.979
I don't smell it today, maybe that means my allergies is worse.

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:48.679
Worse?

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.640
Positive.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.121
Allergies are worse!

00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.481
BAU BAU!

00:28:52.541 --> 00:28:54.903
Okay, well, let's try it!

00:28:54.963 --> 00:28:56.764
Different kind of energy today, huh?

00:28:56.784 --> 00:28:58.124
It's a bit different, huh?

00:28:58.184 --> 00:28:58.524
Yeah.

00:28:58.624 --> 00:29:00.165
Okay, let's try it.

00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:05.588
Is this a different... a different... not flavor, but... No, it's the same as always.

00:29:05.668 --> 00:29:06.769
Is it the same as always?

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.209
Yeah, you just have to believe.

00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:09.950
Okay, I'll have to believe, okay.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.012
Okay, Moco-chan, make sure you take a big...

00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:16.260
Big, big, big, big, big one.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.200
Okay.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:17.820
It's a big one.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.020
Yeah.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.360
Okay.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.661
Okay.

00:29:18.741 --> 00:29:19.741
Oh my goodness.

00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:30.144
Can you believe it?

00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:37.927
Can you believe it?

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.526
BAU BAU!

00:29:55.606 --> 00:29:56.046
Ruffians.

00:29:56.126 --> 00:30:00.449
Ruffians.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.851
There's no natto.

00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:05.851
Confession.

00:30:07.813 --> 00:30:08.753
It was forgotten.

00:30:10.954 --> 00:30:11.595
We're out of natto.

00:30:11.615 --> 00:30:11.935
BAU BAU!

00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:13.336
You didn't do it!

00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:24.182
It was the most delicious air natto ever.

00:30:24.202 --> 00:30:28.246
We're out of natto.

00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:31.349
We're out of natto.

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:35.413
And we realized 30 seconds before starting.

00:30:36.564 --> 00:30:38.646
BAU BAU!

00:30:39.527 --> 00:30:42.890
We're starting the year on a good paw, right?

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.532
Right!

00:30:45.152 --> 00:30:50.397
That was a different kind of attempt today, but you were tricked!

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.492
Is that a challenge?

00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:58.535
Was it a challenge, Moco-chan?

00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:12.149
Pulling the Ruffians.

00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:16.474
I didn't think you would be pulled by the Ruffians.

00:31:17.215 --> 00:31:19.277
I'm a bit disappointed.

00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:24.722
Well, I'd say first challenge of the year succeeded.

00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:37.378
Is that how it sounds usually?

00:31:37.458 --> 00:31:38.459
I don't think so, huh?

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:40.219
It's so easy, huh?

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:50.584
Ruffians, you know it's a new year, so let's make sure to do our best and challenge ourselves in new areas too, okay?

00:31:51.164 --> 00:31:53.505
And that will be continued.

00:31:54.165 --> 00:31:54.746
Next week.

00:31:54.786 --> 00:31:55.346
Next week.

00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:57.488
When we actually have natto.

00:31:57.788 --> 00:31:58.048
Yeah.

00:31:58.288 --> 00:31:59.549
Kyou wa ea natto deshita.

00:31:59.589 --> 00:32:00.430
Ea natto deshita.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.410
Oishikatta!

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.572
BAU BAU!

00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:05.834
BAU BAU!

00:32:05.974 --> 00:32:07.895
I'm continuing on!

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:11.338
The first Doggie of the Day?

00:32:11.398 --> 00:32:13.319
Oh, it doesn't make it the doggy of the year.

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:13.699
No.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.581
It's the first Doggie of the Day of the year.

00:32:17.362 --> 00:32:19.523
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day of the year is!

00:32:20.724 --> 00:32:22.165
The Doggie of the Day of the year is...

00:32:23.584 --> 00:32:27.545
It's... Gutierrez!

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.666
Gutierrez!

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:30.266
BAU BAU!

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:33.187
I feel like he's looking into my soul.

00:32:33.207 --> 00:32:38.209
Oh, well, you know Gutierrez.

00:32:38.229 --> 00:32:39.269
He's a good boy.

00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:40.730
Good bad manners.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.131
What do you think of that, Moco-chan?

00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:51.153
Well... I feel like you can see all of my thoughts in my head, so...

00:32:52.645 --> 00:32:53.665
Maybe I'll forgive him.

00:32:53.685 --> 00:32:56.546
Okay, yeah.

00:32:56.606 --> 00:32:58.106
You know, he's doing his best.

00:32:59.086 --> 00:33:04.007
Apparently, you know, this is his I'm-not-a-fan-of-fireworks face.

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:04.447
Yeah.

00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:05.787
I get that.

00:33:05.907 --> 00:33:17.409
I like fireworks, but you know, sometimes it can be a bit surprising and then I look like... How does he BAU BAU?

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:18.369
I think...

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:28.985
If it's the I'm not a fan of fireworks time, then maybe it's like... BAU BAU!

00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:30.546
BAU BAU!

00:33:30.586 --> 00:33:31.967

00:33:40.673 --> 00:33:41.814
I think that's exactly it.

00:33:43.984 --> 00:33:44.785
This is bad.

00:33:45.265 --> 00:33:48.467
Good tears is on a journey of self-growth.

00:33:48.667 --> 00:33:55.390
You know, he has good intentions and is a good boy, but sometimes makes mistakes too.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.732
Yeah, you know, that's just how things are sometimes.

00:34:00.313 --> 00:34:02.113
No such thing as a perfect puppy.

00:34:03.434 --> 00:34:05.735
Yeah, but I have a good feeling, you know.

00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:07.136
A new year!

00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:09.678
A new good year!

00:34:09.858 --> 00:34:11.919

00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:12.019
Cute.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:19.243
Well, Ruffians, you're still going out for walks, right?

00:34:19.644 --> 00:34:22.145
Well, here is the first walk of the day of the year.

00:34:22.926 --> 00:34:23.766
De-den!

00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:31.866
Wonderful Comiket day!

00:34:31.886 --> 00:34:32.526
Beautiful.

00:34:33.546 --> 00:34:35.106
Oh, the winter sun.

00:34:35.386 --> 00:34:39.447
And you got Icomochi-mama's FUWAMOCO goods!

00:34:39.707 --> 00:34:40.927
BAU BAU!

00:34:40.987 --> 00:34:42.828
Very, very cute!

00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:46.349
We're so glad you had a lot of fun.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:51.690
Yeah, but now it's time to rest after a surely very busy Comiket.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.130
Right.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.030
Time to rest.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.670
Time to enjoy.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.031
Enjoy your treasures, your spoils.

00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:57.731
Put your feet up.

00:34:58.271 --> 00:34:59.051
BAU BAU!

00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:05.014
Next we have our first Question of the Day of the year.

00:35:15.661 --> 00:35:17.902
De-den!

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.823
BAU BAU!

00:35:19.903 --> 00:35:20.563
Good question.

00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:20.863
Ruffians.

00:35:20.883 --> 00:35:21.164
Ruffians!

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:47.404
Maybe it's good to get dis- uh, to be ready to get disappointed.

00:35:47.464 --> 00:35:48.745
It's good to be disappointed!

00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:51.086
Is that what you wanted to say?

00:35:51.106 --> 00:35:51.146
No!

00:35:51.566 --> 00:36:03.434
Get ready to be disappointed because, um, at least, you know, my thought is, on the first playthrough of the game, you know, I kind of want to have the best experience, right?

00:36:04.174 --> 00:36:04.535
Right?

00:36:05.755 --> 00:36:09.498
And sometimes, maybe, Fuwawa might not pick-

00:36:10.287 --> 00:36:14.070
The best heroine to go with to have the best experience of the game.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:20.655
So, I kind of searched up online what the recommended playthrough order is.

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:31.804
And, I will, even if the heroine I'm most interested in, if she's in the last, the last one to play, I still follow the recommendations.

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:35.267
Isn't that the worst Ruffians?

00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:36.668
That's cheating!

00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:44.008
But I feel like the developers, they want me to have the best experience, right?

00:36:44.749 --> 00:36:45.149
Same!

00:36:45.629 --> 00:36:47.591
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:36:48.412 --> 00:36:50.473
Yeah.

00:36:50.493 --> 00:36:51.794
Oh, you go with least interested?

00:36:52.055 --> 00:36:55.878
But then what if you're like, oh, I really don't like her, and then you're like, this game, mm-mm.

00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:56.718
Right?

00:36:56.738 --> 00:36:58.340
That would be kind of sad, so.

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:03.191
But I feel like, generally, this method hasn't failed me yet.

00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:10.677
You know, even for Chihuahua, I did that, and I was definitely very glad I did because, you know, Mochi!

00:37:10.737 --> 00:37:11.558
Mochi!

00:37:11.578 --> 00:37:11.878
Hi!

00:37:12.018 --> 00:37:13.059
Our favorite!

00:37:13.379 --> 00:37:18.283
You know, she was the final rule, and I feel like that was the perfect way to complete the game.

00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:20.645
It's important.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:21.506
Yeah.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.667
A lot of tears.

00:37:22.927 --> 00:37:24.628
BAU BAU!

00:37:24.688 --> 00:37:27.270
Thank you for the question!

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:36.557
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your Doggie of the Day, your scoops today, some great journalism, your questions, too.

00:37:37.377 --> 00:37:38.018
Headpats, too.

00:37:38.078 --> 00:37:39.359
Important part, right?

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:40.720
No, headpats for the Ruffians.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.441
Oh, headpats for the Ruffians.

00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:43.342
And for Mococo.

00:37:46.123 --> 00:37:48.163
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:37:48.664 --> 00:37:54.666
Please, please continue to support FUWAMOCO Morning in the new year in 2024.

00:37:54.726 --> 00:38:02.989
Here you know, FUWAMOCO Morning is going to always be a show that's made all together, so we hope you'll continue to feel that way, too!

00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:05.190
BAU BAU!

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.391
Oh, well, for our next team, what do we have, Moco-chan?

00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:09.651
Wow.

00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:18.572
Ruffians, as you might know, our next stream was going to be our Advent.

00:38:18.632 --> 00:38:28.079
I think we're going to be having our New Year outfit reveals, but there's been a bit of a change of plans and our outfit reveal won't be able to happen tonight.

00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:32.422
But because of that, we made some changes to our schedule.

00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:33.323
Instead,

00:38:34.223 --> 00:38:38.786
We'll be doing a very comfy and cozy super chat.

00:38:39.306 --> 00:38:41.527
Is that okay, Ruffians?

00:38:41.607 --> 00:38:42.928
We'll spend some nice time.

00:38:43.308 --> 00:38:49.191
We hope that you'll be there with us.

00:38:49.531 --> 00:38:53.854
Just nice and cozy, filled with laughs.

00:38:54.274 --> 00:38:59.717
We hope that you'll really look forward to our new year outfit reveals in the very

00:39:00.484 --> 00:39:01.425
Near future.

00:39:01.625 --> 00:39:02.586
Soon, okay?

00:39:02.687 --> 00:39:03.407
Soon.

00:39:03.948 --> 00:39:07.152
It just means we get to look forward to it more, you know?

00:39:11.356 --> 00:39:13.419

This is what our schedule looks like.

00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:20.807
I would like to let you know that there might be a number of schedule changes kinda out there.

00:39:21.227 --> 00:39:21.888

00:39:49.682 --> 00:39:57.348

I hope that you'll continue to wake up early and allow us to help you start the day off on the right paw.

00:40:04.393 --> 00:40:07.675
Protect your smile straight from the beginning of the morning!

00:40:09.236 --> 00:40:15.280
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!
