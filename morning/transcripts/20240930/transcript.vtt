06:16.936 --> 06:18.217
BAU BAU!

06:18.257 --> 06:19.777
Thank you for joining us today!

06:19.938 --> 06:24.080
Another week of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:24.360 --> 06:25.160
Good morning!

06:25.200 --> 06:25.540
BAU BAU!

06:31.124 --> 06:45.119
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday aka FUWAMOCO and it's hosted by us,

06:45.619 --> 06:46.219
FUWAMOCO!

06:46.660 --> 06:52.482
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:53.102 --> 06:58.005
Please take your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:58.345 --> 07:02.127
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:02.147 --> 07:02.707
BAU BAU!

07:02.727 --> 07:05.228
Ruffians, good morning!

07:05.248 --> 07:07.729
Are you feeling rested?

07:08.169 --> 07:10.951
It's the last day of September.

07:11.071 --> 07:11.351
Almost!

07:11.391 --> 07:13.192
Let's start to a brand new life!

07:14.152 --> 07:14.953
I can't believe it.

07:15.013 --> 07:16.294
Are you ready for it?

07:16.314 --> 07:17.375
Yeah, you're weak!

07:17.395 --> 07:18.797
But I'm ready.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.518
I don't think you're ready for it.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.301
Yeah!

07:23.921 --> 07:26.564
It's almost October!

07:27.885 --> 07:34.731
But you know, the new month means there'll be a bunch more exciting things coming up, especially...

07:41.998 --> 07:46.481
BAU BAU!

07:46.862 --> 07:48.042
We are ready!

07:49.523 --> 07:52.405
But you'll be here with us, right?

07:52.725 --> 07:58.949
So even if things are a little bit scary, it'll be okay because you're here to hold our paws, right?

07:59.950 --> 08:00.290
Right.

08:05.363 --> 08:10.625
Donkey Kong's a horror game too, so... Sometimes, maybe there'll be some Donkey Kong.

08:10.885 --> 08:12.706
This month too.

08:15.507 --> 08:22.309
Nothing better to start off a new month or end off an old month than a bit of disappointment.

08:23.189 --> 08:25.910
Disappointment?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.491
What happened that's disappointing, Moco-chan?

08:28.791 --> 08:29.891
Was it your driving?

08:31.752 --> 08:32.372
No.

08:32.612 --> 08:34.113
I wish you could say it was your driving.

08:38.006 --> 08:39.666
Another Pero Sighting!

08:40.047 --> 08:41.427
Just like every time.

08:41.447 --> 08:43.829
Every time!

08:43.929 --> 08:47.170
Why do we have to start it out every time with a sighting?

08:47.190 --> 08:51.112
Let's see what Pero spotted this time.

08:51.132 --> 08:51.612
Well... De-den!

08:52.833 --> 08:55.694
No sighting!

09:02.498 --> 09:03.398
That's good news!

09:03.418 --> 09:04.178
Nothing.

09:04.198 --> 09:09.640
I couldn't be able to start off a spooky month without something nasty.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.540
This is good!

09:10.580 --> 09:11.260
This is good!

09:11.340 --> 09:14.061
No nasty start to the day!

09:14.661 --> 09:17.542
A nice start to, you know, the last day of the month.

09:18.322 --> 09:21.243
I have a good feeling that things are gonna be good.

09:21.303 --> 09:21.983
Yeah.

09:22.023 --> 09:23.544
Yeah.

09:23.584 --> 09:24.984
Listen, we did a peril!

09:25.024 --> 09:26.624
We didn't do anything!

09:26.844 --> 09:27.244
No!

09:28.985 --> 09:29.065
No.

09:32.755 --> 09:33.616
Impossible?

09:35.237 --> 09:38.259
Well, look, it happens, so I think it's possible!

09:38.920 --> 09:42.342
Yeah, if Ruffians don't see Pero, then there's no Pero Sightings.

09:42.963 --> 09:46.626
This could be a good sign as to, you know... He's gone.

09:46.646 --> 09:50.368
Gone for... Who knows when.

09:50.949 --> 09:51.990
Yeah, yeah.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.531
Back in the back rooms!

09:56.173 --> 09:58.134
So we have to go find him in the back rooms.

09:58.575 --> 09:59.676
But we don't know where he is.

09:59.696 --> 10:00.876
There's no Sightings, so...

10:01.860 --> 10:03.081
We don't know.

10:04.161 --> 10:04.601
Answer.

10:05.061 --> 10:05.502
Answer.

10:06.302 --> 10:08.203
BAU BAU!

10:08.223 --> 10:10.964
A little less nastiness in the day today.

10:11.124 --> 10:12.244
That's always good!

10:12.264 --> 10:12.344
Yeah!

10:12.724 --> 10:13.565
BAU BAU!

10:14.165 --> 10:16.246
BAU BAU!

10:16.666 --> 10:19.667
Well, there's a bunch of things that went on this weekend.

10:19.687 --> 10:19.787
Yeah!

10:20.287 --> 10:26.010
And one of those big ones was the hololive device 3Gloss!

10:26.710 --> 10:29.351
3Gloss celebrated their 3D debut!

10:29.451 --> 10:30.372
Yeah!

10:30.412 --> 10:31.572
BAU BAU!

10:32.932 --> 10:35.793
Did you check it out?

10:35.813 --> 10:36.554
Did you see?

10:36.574 --> 10:37.834
They reached the top!

10:37.894 --> 10:40.075
They performed their original songs!

10:47.977 --> 10:57.840
And also, they included some brand new unit songs that will be on their upcoming album ReGLOSS, which is releasing on November 6th.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.421
I always think, you know, I'm so excited for it that I'm like, oh, only a few days from now!

11:04.522 --> 11:05.322
November 6th.

11:05.342 --> 11:06.062
Not October 6th.

11:06.082 --> 11:06.262
Yeah.

11:10.693 --> 11:15.636
Yeah, so we still have to wait a little bit, but that'll make it even more exciting, you know?

11:15.656 --> 11:21.539
And you know, in the 3D Live, they all had a solo song or some sort of moment to showcase themselves individually.

11:21.839 --> 11:25.000
You know, with Aoku performing Shiny Smiley Story.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.362
Very cute.

11:27.462 --> 11:32.564
Mirika in a death match to tell which meat is which and the price.

11:32.744 --> 11:35.826
We had a little bit of Kogeka at the end.

11:35.886 --> 11:37.407
You just got it right!

11:37.947 --> 11:45.696
FUWAMOCO And then Baden with a very cute performance of Montauk around the museum.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.638
It was so cute!

11:47.738 --> 11:51.923
FUWAMOCO And then Banjo with an amazing dance cover!

11:52.144 --> 11:53.085
All those moves!

11:53.405 --> 11:54.566
FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:54.606 --> 11:57.709
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

12:13.485 --> 12:18.427
Us, FUWAMOCO and Biboo, we had our own watchalog here on our YouTube!

12:18.808 --> 12:23.009
So if you're gonna check it out, maybe you wanna watch it together with us too!

12:23.510 --> 12:26.591
And we helped translate some of the MCs a little bit off the top.

12:27.071 --> 12:29.132
And I had some mishaps.

12:29.372 --> 12:30.613
Translation sync.

12:31.588 --> 12:40.699
Yeah, so please check it out and also a big congrats to B-Girls!

12:40.759 --> 12:44.283
Congratulations!

12:45.124 --> 12:45.605
Mama!

12:45.885 --> 12:47.727
Yeah, the translation thing.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.670
It's so embarrassing!

12:49.850 --> 12:50.911
It happens!

12:54.022 --> 12:55.984
BAU BAU!

12:56.084 --> 13:03.588
Well, I'm sure that probably a lot of Ruffians have already heard about this one.

13:03.608 --> 13:09.292
It's next, but there's a huge collab coming up that FUWAMOCO!

13:10.112 --> 13:14.134
We're super excited for you!

13:14.975 --> 13:20.157
There's going to be a special collab with Round1 and hololive!

13:20.577 --> 13:24.459
And it's happening all across Japan and the US!

13:27.783 --> 13:28.063
October 11th!

13:42.398 --> 13:51.288
You know what this means is that you can go to your nearest Round1 and you'll be able to see us standing there!

14:05.691 --> 14:07.492
Do you know what Round1 is?

14:08.192 --> 14:08.332
Oh!

14:08.712 --> 14:09.812
Oh, that's cool.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.733
I don't know what Round1 is, but... I can't see.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.454
It says Bowling at Arcade at the top.

14:15.514 --> 14:16.315
That's a big clue!

14:16.375 --> 14:17.195
Yeah!

14:17.395 --> 14:17.835
Yes!

14:17.935 --> 14:19.636
There's lots of fun stuff there!

14:19.676 --> 14:25.358
There's bowling, arcade, karaoke, just... many fun times all together!

14:25.498 --> 14:28.739
And we're ready to have a bunch of fun with you there!

14:29.199 --> 14:29.299
Yeah!

14:29.379 --> 14:32.440
And there's so many very cute collab items too!

14:32.500 --> 14:34.541
You wanna take a... take a... Yeah!

14:34.561 --> 14:35.201
...take a look at them?

14:36.383 --> 14:39.666
First up, there's our drinks!

14:40.767 --> 14:44.030
We have special flowers for our drinks!

14:45.011 --> 14:46.453
They all kind of match too.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.035
We have flowers!

14:49.295 --> 14:51.918
Powerade Fizz!

14:52.238 --> 14:54.920
Mococo Strawberry Cream Soda!

14:55.841 --> 14:58.223
And they match too, Ruffians!

14:58.984 --> 15:02.305
Yeah, but then we also- IRyS-senpai!

15:02.545 --> 15:04.725
Iris Strawberry Lemonade!

15:05.045 --> 15:06.846
Iris Strawberry.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.226
I see what you did there, huh?

15:10.246 --> 15:14.367
And we have the Ninomaya Mango Cola!

15:14.867 --> 15:17.748
Mango Cola, but there's an orange on the side.

15:17.768 --> 15:18.348
I like it.

15:18.588 --> 15:19.608
That sounds really yummy!

15:19.648 --> 15:22.649
Is that one of Ina-senpai's puns there?

15:24.260 --> 15:26.121
Let's try to pull a fast one high.

15:27.202 --> 15:31.144
And then we have got good sparkling blue soda!

15:31.224 --> 15:31.404
Yeah!

15:33.605 --> 15:37.687
I like how the whipped cream kinda looks like a bit of a fin there, right?

15:37.727 --> 15:38.187
Yeah!

15:38.788 --> 15:39.828
Yeah!

15:40.589 --> 15:43.290
I say they're all gonna be really delicious!

15:43.430 --> 15:46.071
Everyone sort of has a funny spin on their name.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.113
You know, Fuwawa is...

15:50.977 --> 15:53.458
Mococo Cream Soda.

15:53.938 --> 15:56.599
Yeah, it works well, right?

15:57.359 --> 15:57.859
Yeah!

15:57.959 --> 16:05.542
I was just thinking, why is it IRyS-senpai was the only one that got the cherry on top, huh?

16:05.562 --> 16:06.982
Strawberry, but there's a cherry!

16:07.342 --> 16:08.823
Mango, but there's an orange!

16:13.660 --> 16:21.787
It's so amazing I just have like an image of Iris up by drinking the drink and then eating the cherry.

16:25.017 --> 16:25.778
I could see that.

16:26.098 --> 16:26.478
Right?

16:27.259 --> 16:27.859
Yeah.

16:27.899 --> 16:28.680
But you know what?

16:28.720 --> 16:33.163
You get a special random coaster included too!

16:33.203 --> 16:35.224
You can collect all eight!

16:35.324 --> 16:36.565
And you know what that means?

16:36.905 --> 16:39.507
You can bring it home and use it in your room too!

16:39.527 --> 16:41.088
Yeah, just like us.

16:42.449 --> 16:44.150
Yeah, but that's not it.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.351
More not just drinks.

16:47.032 --> 16:48.733
There's merch!

16:48.753 --> 16:50.254
Oh my gosh, it's really tiny.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.676
It's a little bit hard to see.

16:52.696 --> 16:54.337
We'll go over this portion of it.

16:54.817 --> 16:55.397
Yeah.

16:55.838 --> 16:57.618
Well, there's towels.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.259
There's cushions.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.299
Lawn cushions.

17:00.379 --> 17:01.200
Dye towels.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.140
Bath towels.

17:02.380 --> 17:02.941
Bags.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.621
Acrylic diorama stands.

17:04.661 --> 17:06.382
Diorama acrylic stands.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.643
Tote bags.

17:07.923 --> 17:09.503
And they're all very, very cute!

17:09.623 --> 17:10.984
Yeah!

17:11.304 --> 17:14.606
But, Moco-chan... Wow.

17:15.306 --> 17:18.667
There's also... De-den!

17:18.988 --> 17:19.488
Plushies!

17:19.588 --> 17:20.208
Plushies!

17:20.328 --> 17:21.068
Yeah!

17:21.929 --> 17:24.430
And oh, for Ruffians, that

17:24.980 --> 17:26.401
We are in the U.S.

17:27.162 --> 17:31.405
It might be a little bit rough because these are U.S.

17:31.665 --> 17:32.585
limited.

17:32.665 --> 17:33.266
Yeah, they're U.S.

17:33.306 --> 17:33.986
limited.

17:34.407 --> 17:35.127
Yeah.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.749
And they're first come first serve.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.190
Yeah.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.392
They're very cute though!

17:41.492 --> 17:46.095
Don't you just want to get your own FUWAMOCO out of the crane?

17:46.435 --> 17:47.856
Can you get them online?

17:47.936 --> 17:48.276
No!

17:48.777 --> 17:50.278
It's crane game prizes.

17:50.318 --> 17:51.639
Crane game prizes.

17:51.659 --> 17:53.180
You have to rescue them!

17:54.002 --> 17:59.908
Time to get good at crane games!

18:15.944 --> 18:18.205
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

18:34.992 --> 18:35.392
Oh no.

18:35.812 --> 18:39.593
Currently the towels were released on the 11th.

18:39.613 --> 18:42.133

18:53.215 --> 18:54.795
So Ruffians!

18:55.435 --> 18:57.436

18:57.456 --> 19:00.036
For all Ruffians that want to try their luck at getting them!

19:00.656 --> 19:03.917
I definitely, definitely want to

19:05.742 --> 19:06.483
Try your best.

19:07.283 --> 19:09.825
Don't fight them other Ruffians, okay?

19:10.305 --> 19:13.667
But Ruffians, make sure you help each other, okay?

19:13.687 --> 19:14.367
I know.

19:14.827 --> 19:24.333
But FUWAMOCO, we're so so excited to be a part of this because for us, arcades have always been a very special place for us as young demon dogs.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.494
We have a lot of memories.

19:27.014 --> 19:34.198
And now, it makes us so happy to think that you're gonna be able to head to Round1 and be able to do those kind of things

19:34.658 --> 19:38.742
Have you ever tried a crane game before, Ruffians?

19:39.903 --> 19:41.945
You know, FUWAMOCO, we're puppies.

19:42.085 --> 19:42.725
Momo-puppies.

19:42.745 --> 19:48.791
But crane games, they're really, really fun.

19:48.971 --> 19:49.972
You buy them!

19:50.032 --> 19:51.012
You may buy them!

19:52.208 --> 19:53.729
Wow, FUWAMOCO!

19:53.949 --> 19:58.713
Ruffians, you know FUWAMOCO, we're not the best at games.

19:58.733 --> 20:00.395
We're very serious though.

20:00.595 --> 20:09.002
But you know what, so creating games might seem kind of impossible to win at first, but really it's perfectly good.

20:09.022 --> 20:12.545
You can do it once you kind of have an idea of just how they work.

20:13.425 --> 20:15.226
Yeah, FUWAMOCO!

20:15.266 --> 20:17.728
We've won a bunch of prizes from crane games.

20:18.088 --> 20:22.271
Even things in the crane game that you weren't supposed to win before, too.

20:22.391 --> 20:26.893
We took a bottom part of the crane game machine.

20:26.933 --> 20:27.454
Yeah.

20:28.014 --> 20:30.255
It was not supposed to go home.

20:30.596 --> 20:31.256
You took it home.

20:31.376 --> 20:32.317
I took it home!

20:32.357 --> 20:32.657
Yeah!

20:32.877 --> 20:34.938
But it's really fun.

20:34.998 --> 20:38.921
We really like playing crane games together with friends.

20:39.301 --> 20:42.503
Yeah, and FUWAMOCO, you know, we can get really noisy.

20:43.363 --> 20:43.763
Yeah.

20:43.944 --> 20:51.870
I guess it's a bit easy though because for some of them you can go sideways and then backwards into the machine right so you get two tries.

20:52.231 --> 20:58.736
So then what we do is one of us obviously is controlling and then the other one looks at the other, the other side.

20:59.817 --> 21:01.879
And then we work as a team together.

21:01.899 --> 21:05.282
So definitely if you have friends together with you please work as a team.

21:07.824 --> 21:13.208
Dear best, I want to see the Ruffians' video of rescuing us from the Great Perroccino!

21:13.709 --> 21:15.590
Please, please show us, okay?

21:16.191 --> 21:19.713
And you know there's also karaoke and bowling like we mentioned!

21:19.733 --> 21:23.256
So uh, maybe you might be able to sing a ballad over there?

21:23.396 --> 21:24.497
Maybe!

21:24.897 --> 21:25.438
Yeah!

21:28.235 --> 21:37.560
But there's lots to see and do, so we really hope that Ruffians that you'll decide to head over to Round1 when it's close to you, far to you.

21:37.880 --> 21:42.322
Maybe you know you can make some travel plans together with some Ruffians near you too.

21:42.382 --> 21:45.863
Please don't push yourself to get them, okay?

21:46.203 --> 21:47.424
And number one, have fun!

21:47.444 --> 21:49.245
It's about having fun!

21:49.285 --> 21:50.645
Do not feel pressured!

21:50.725 --> 21:55.328
Especially, you know, I know it's tricky when we're very, very limited.

21:55.828 --> 21:55.968
What?

21:56.448 --> 22:00.810
You know, there's always a future too, okay?

22:00.870 --> 22:04.351
Don't worry too much!

22:04.591 --> 22:05.912
Have fun!

22:06.432 --> 22:08.433
FUWAMOCO program is mine!

22:08.873 --> 22:12.515
Have fun with everyone!

22:13.055 --> 22:19.217
BAU BAU!

22:19.618 --> 22:22.019
We have some more news for you Ruffians!

22:23.360 --> 22:26.883
This one's brand new, so I'm not sure if you've heard about it yet.

22:26.903 --> 22:28.705
It just happened!

22:28.945 --> 22:31.527
But Suisei-senpai!

22:31.808 --> 22:36.071
She's been up to some really cool things!

22:36.091 --> 22:43.198
Because just a few hours ago, Suisei-senpai, she had a sudden gorilla live in Shibuya!

22:43.218 --> 22:46.200
Just right there on the street!

22:46.220 --> 22:47.381
A street live!

22:47.782 --> 22:48.142
So cool.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.207
Moonlight.

23:20.414 --> 23:21.395
Yeah!

23:21.675 --> 23:24.777
I love this look to the music video and everything!

23:24.798 --> 23:26.419
And you know, it's written by Natori!

23:26.499 --> 23:30.142
I also wrote songs like Overdose and Kobo Senpai's House!

23:30.202 --> 23:31.343
Yeah!

23:31.563 --> 23:35.386
And Moonlight is just such a calming and kind of funky tune!

23:35.726 --> 23:40.750
And it really makes you want to listen to it while driving around the city at night!

23:41.070 --> 23:47.155
It makes sense why Suisei Senpai would perform in Shibuya, though, because it's a very Shibuya song, too.

23:47.515 --> 23:48.776
Yeah, it sounds like a moonlight!

23:50.377 --> 23:52.999
Yeah, moonlight in the moonlight.

23:53.039 --> 24:00.763
But if you haven't been able to see it, please go check out the song on video over on Suisei Senpai's YouTube channel!

24:01.404 --> 24:06.567
Yeah, it's so cool to see Suisei Senpai do cool things like this, right?

24:06.627 --> 24:09.469
Don't watch it live, you know the performance!

24:10.649 --> 24:14.732
Yeah, you know, it'd be cool if we can do even more big things.

24:15.563 --> 24:17.044
Yeah!

24:17.145 --> 24:18.806
We're still just new puppies!

24:18.826 --> 24:19.807
We're growing up!

24:19.827 --> 24:20.087
Yes!

24:20.287 --> 24:21.008
Dream life!

24:21.068 --> 24:22.770
Yeah!

24:23.410 --> 24:25.732
Yeah!

24:25.893 --> 24:27.574
So many amazing things!

24:27.914 --> 24:28.675
Yeah!

24:28.695 --> 24:29.776
Please check it out!

24:29.956 --> 24:31.518
BAU BAU!

24:33.984 --> 24:36.125
Well, I'm still a Ruffian.

24:36.185 --> 24:37.006
Yeah, you know.

24:37.066 --> 24:38.667
It's the end of the month.

24:39.247 --> 24:43.710
Our other senpai's been up to a bunch of different things.

24:43.790 --> 24:50.074
But just the other day, she had her special ocean charity stream!

24:50.595 --> 24:51.235
Did you watch?

24:52.056 --> 24:52.556
Yeah!

24:52.916 --> 24:55.098
FUWAMOCO, we watched too!

24:55.138 --> 25:00.121
You know, she explored a huge aquarium filled with mysterious aquatic... aquatic?

25:00.441 --> 25:00.981
Aquatic?

25:02.042 --> 25:02.482
Aquatic?

25:04.163 --> 25:04.383
Aquatic!

25:04.403 --> 25:04.443
No?

25:04.463 --> 25:04.603
Aquatic?

25:04.623 --> 25:04.763
Aquatic?

25:04.783 --> 25:05.023
Aquatic?

25:05.043 --> 25:05.423
Is that right?

25:05.463 --> 25:06.304
It doesn't sound right anymore.

25:07.984 --> 25:08.144
Huh?

25:08.224 --> 25:08.324
Aqua?

25:08.344 --> 25:08.584
Aquatic?

25:08.604 --> 25:09.265

25:09.325 --> 25:09.545

Aquatic?

25:10.665 --> 25:10.805
Aquatic?

25:10.845 --> 25:11.085
Aquatic?

25:11.105 --> 25:11.305
Aquatic?

25:11.325 --> 25:11.585
Aquatic?

25:11.645 --> 25:11.825
Aquatic?

25:11.845 --> 25:12.025

25:12.045 --> 25:12.626

25:16.967 --> 25:17.207

25:18.587 --> 25:18.768
Aquatic?

25:18.788 --> 25:19.008
Aquatic?

25:19.028 --> 25:19.468
Aquatic?

25:19.528 --> 25:20.148
Aquatic?

25:20.168 --> 25:20.468
Aquatic?

25:20.488 --> 25:20.628
Aquatic?

25:20.668 --> 25:21.448

25:21.588 --> 25:23.449

25:29.751 --> 25:29.891
Aquatic?

25:29.911 --> 25:30.091
Aquatic?

25:30.111 --> 25:30.251
Aquatic?

25:30.271 --> 25:30.431
Aquatic?

25:30.451 --> 25:30.751
Aquatic?

25:30.771 --> 25:31.051
Aquatic?

25:31.071 --> 25:31.672
Aquatic?

25:31.692 --> 25:31.832
Aquatic?

25:31.852 --> 25:32.072
Aquatic?

25:32.092 --> 25:32.432
Aquatic?

25:32.452 --> 25:32.772
Aquatic?

25:33.917 --> 25:37.800
hololive members too!

25:38.220 --> 25:41.323
Did you see FUWAMOCO?

25:41.363 --> 25:44.505
FUWAMOCO we are there too!

25:44.525 --> 25:45.626
We were cuddle bears!

25:45.686 --> 25:47.728
So cute!

25:47.768 --> 25:49.329
Did you see us?

25:52.879 --> 25:52.939
Yes!

25:53.179 --> 25:55.741
And look, we have the rest of Advent and Shiori.

25:55.781 --> 25:57.663
It looks really terrifying!

25:58.103 --> 25:59.764
Biboo looks really silly.

26:00.365 --> 26:02.927
And Nerissa, well, she's all legs, right?

26:03.327 --> 26:03.827
All legs.

26:03.867 --> 26:04.488
Yeah.

26:04.548 --> 26:07.290
Then we have an Elizabeth Swordfish.

26:07.350 --> 26:08.451
Swordfish!

26:08.471 --> 26:11.553
I'm gonna guess now there's a Catfish.

26:12.074 --> 26:12.554
Catfish!

26:12.574 --> 26:13.375
Botan-senpai.

26:13.635 --> 26:15.036
The Lionfish.

26:15.556 --> 26:17.578
Mumei-senpai.

26:17.618 --> 26:18.599
She's a cute fish.

26:18.739 --> 26:19.820
I don't know which fish.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.040
Is it...

26:21.410 --> 26:21.890
The what's it?

26:22.071 --> 26:22.751
The Owlfish?

26:25.734 --> 26:26.234
The what's it?

26:26.274 --> 26:26.635
Pufferfish?

26:26.675 --> 26:27.295
Pufferfish, yes!

26:27.315 --> 26:28.917
I don't know if that's a pufferfish.

26:29.677 --> 26:31.959
And then we have Gigi the Mudskipper!

26:31.999 --> 26:32.940
Mudskipper!

26:33.120 --> 26:33.981
Yeah!

26:34.401 --> 26:38.605
And Bae-senpai is the... The Bay... Dancing fish?

26:38.645 --> 26:39.486
Betta fish.

26:39.546 --> 26:41.347
Betta... Is that the right one?

26:41.367 --> 26:42.068
I think it's that.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.689
I just can't say the fish names.

26:43.709 --> 26:43.789
Yeah!

26:43.829 --> 26:43.909
Yes!

26:43.929 --> 26:45.070
It was so cool to see everybody!

26:45.090 --> 26:46.471
Everybody there like, oh it's so cute!

26:46.491 --> 26:46.551
Oh!

26:46.591 --> 26:47.492
You got Cecelia the Frog!

27:09.269 --> 27:09.730
It's so cute

27:10.350 --> 27:13.951
Ohana-senpai, the Alex Coro, the Oopa Loopa.

27:13.971 --> 27:15.652
So cute!

27:16.212 --> 27:26.895
And you know, on top of this amazing world that Ame-senpai has built, she also raised $200,000 towards ocean conservation!

27:26.915 --> 27:26.895
$200,000.

27:26.935 --> 27:27.596
Oh my gosh.

27:33.415 --> 27:36.278
Congratulations!

27:36.358 --> 27:38.700
That's absolutely amazing!

27:38.840 --> 27:43.324
And in case you're interested, you can also go out and check the world in VRChat!

27:43.364 --> 27:46.046
You can go and check out the aquarium.

27:46.086 --> 27:49.168
See all the hololive fish.

27:49.509 --> 27:50.570
Aquatic creatures.

27:50.770 --> 27:54.233
FUWAMOCO don't laugh at me!

27:55.053 --> 27:56.995
Aquatic creatures.

27:57.575 --> 27:58.356
I think so.

27:59.197 --> 27:59.437
Yes.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.972
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:15.751 --> 28:17.071
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:17.091 --> 28:18.292
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

28:44.219 --> 28:46.940
Today is Ame-senpai's last stream at 5 p.m.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.180
PT, 9 a.m.

28:47.220 --> 28:47.500
JST.

28:47.580 --> 28:48.240
Okay!

29:14.376 --> 29:17.920
So let's all be there to say goodbye with a smile, okay?

29:19.482 --> 29:24.107
BAU BAU!

29:24.227 --> 29:26.149
Thank you so much, Ame-senpai!

29:26.270 --> 29:27.971
BAU BAU!

29:34.175 --> 29:38.556
BAU BAU will be there too.

29:38.756 --> 29:40.277
Doggie of the Day!

29:40.317 --> 29:41.497
I'm Doggie of the Day!

29:41.517 --> 29:43.238
It's my time already!

29:44.358 --> 29:47.979
Okay, let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan.

29:48.299 --> 29:48.559
We have...

29:52.078 --> 29:55.340
Today's Doggie of the Day is Mugi!

29:55.380 --> 29:58.241
What a pretty girl!

29:58.881 --> 30:01.883
So nice smile, those eyebrows too!

30:01.983 --> 30:03.823
Very fluffy.

30:04.404 --> 30:09.326
Those ears... They're not quite as big as my ears, but they're pretty big.

30:11.891 --> 30:12.551
Maybe!

30:13.031 --> 30:15.132
What do you think of the pink collar there, Moco-chan?

30:15.192 --> 30:17.173
Would you like to borrow it?

30:18.034 --> 30:21.115
I like mine okay!

30:21.255 --> 30:24.217
It matches Mugi well too!

30:25.177 --> 30:27.919
Well, Moco-chan, how does Mugi BAU BAU?

30:35.456 --> 30:39.417
Mugi is just a baby.

30:39.737 --> 30:49.420
Mugi, she looks like a very well-behaved girl.

30:49.640 --> 30:53.422
And you know she even BAU BAUs together with us too!

30:53.442 --> 30:53.842
Mugi!

30:54.262 --> 30:54.802
BAU BAU!

30:59.142 --> 31:00.163
I can hear her.

31:02.064 --> 31:08.367
Well, we hope she's a very good sister and that she keeps your parents good company here.

31:08.387 --> 31:10.728
Nothing's better than good company, you know it!

31:11.108 --> 31:14.170
BAU BAU!

31:14.910 --> 31:19.592
And next we have on Today I Went On A Walk.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.834
We have... De-den!

31:26.636 --> 31:28.680
Oh, beautiful day!

31:29.827 --> 31:32.348
First walk in a brand new city!

31:32.388 --> 31:34.649
Congratulations on moving!

31:34.769 --> 31:36.710
BAU BAU!

31:36.770 --> 31:38.511
My shirt was a lot of work.

31:38.571 --> 31:40.892
Moving's never fun enough.

31:40.952 --> 31:41.872
Lots of change.

31:41.952 --> 31:45.134
It can be exciting but a little bit scary too.

31:45.474 --> 31:50.856
I know, we're glad that you were able to get out and take a look at all of your surroundings too.

31:51.657 --> 31:52.537
It's so green.

31:52.597 --> 31:55.739
It really looks like you live in such a beautiful place.

31:56.299 --> 31:58.300
I love that little bridge there too.

31:59.453 --> 32:02.116
Wow, we're very alive.

32:02.757 --> 32:07.522
Yeah, we hope that you enjoy many many wonderful walks around here.

32:07.662 --> 32:09.864
Until maybe bug spray is a good idea.

32:09.964 --> 32:10.905
Maybe, yeah.

32:11.786 --> 32:12.407
Just a thought.

32:13.288 --> 32:15.430
BAU BAU!

32:16.091 --> 32:19.355
And next, we have our Question of the Day!

32:19.475 --> 32:21.357
We have De-den!

32:22.398 --> 32:24.559
Hi FUWAMOCO!

32:24.879 --> 32:31.624
We have recorded voice packs for various situations, but you have a voice pack that you both like!

32:31.664 --> 32:36.487
We're looking forward to seeing more voice packs for various situations in the future!

32:36.527 --> 32:37.568
BAU BAU!

32:40.168 --> 32:42.933
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.862
The extreme love, the four kinds of extreme love.

32:58.182 --> 33:01.423
The yandere voice part was a bit different.

33:02.343 --> 33:03.023
You know?

33:03.103 --> 33:05.504
Maybe just because of some reasons, you know?

33:05.584 --> 33:13.767
I think there was a lot of Ruffians who were hoping that eventually one day we'd do a yandere voice part.

33:13.807 --> 33:20.530
So it was really nice to be able to challenge ourselves to something maybe a little bit more intense and then also

33:21.170 --> 33:24.573
I look forward to all of your reactions.

33:24.913 --> 33:28.816
And if you haven't had a chance to listen to it, you can still go and listen to it.

33:28.936 --> 33:30.477
Yeah, there's a big sample.

33:30.657 --> 33:35.221
Yeah, on the hololive official store, so please go check it out there.

33:35.401 --> 33:41.005
Otherwise, I also like the mischievous preschool pack.

33:41.565 --> 33:42.766
Mainly because that day...

33:44.127 --> 33:45.848
I was really stuffed up.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.311
Like, incredibly stuffed up.

33:49.451 --> 33:54.415
I do not know how many tissues I went through while recording.

33:55.636 --> 34:01.080
So, it really... It really got the... Sort of snotty brat feeling, huh?

34:01.220 --> 34:02.741
Yeah, definitely.

34:02.761 --> 34:07.384
You know, I was a very good school teacher, I think.

34:08.145 --> 34:13.169
Maybe made a couple mistakes here and there, but... My heart was in the right place, so...

34:14.683 --> 34:18.184
We'll continue doing our best in more voice facts too!

34:18.365 --> 34:22.426
It's always a nice challenge, so... Please look forward to that, okay?

34:22.806 --> 34:23.987
BAU BAU!

34:24.007 --> 34:28.789
Ruffians, thank you so much for all your submissions!

34:29.089 --> 34:38.473
Remember, if you want to be a part, a bigger part of FUWAMOCO Morning, please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

34:38.513 --> 34:41.814
We're always looking to see who's the doggy of your day.

34:41.854 --> 34:43.015
Maybe it could be the doggy

34:43.215 --> 34:43.575
BAU BAU!

35:09.745 --> 35:12.526
Wow, we have another stream coming up!

35:12.546 --> 35:16.888
Let's take a look at our schedule!

35:17.389 --> 35:23.031
After this, you know, FUWAMOCO, we have a very busy day full of practice and recordings waiting for us.

35:23.632 --> 35:30.035
So the next time we'll be seeing you is for our home 3D reveal tomorrow.

35:30.695 --> 35:33.037
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

35:33.138 --> 35:34.579
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

35:54.699 --> 35:55.620
An advent collab.

35:55.660 --> 35:58.903
This time we're playing not EDF6, we're playing The Forest.

35:58.923 --> 35:59.704
The Forest!

35:59.784 --> 36:02.146
It's the first time that we've ever played a game like this.

36:02.226 --> 36:02.546
I know.

36:02.566 --> 36:05.409
I think we're supposed to live together, work together in the forest.

36:05.469 --> 36:09.413
I said I would because I was seeing comments saying that it's a horror game.

36:09.433 --> 36:13.016
I thought it's like a survival in the forest.

36:13.036 --> 36:15.018
I thought it was a huge dunk in the forest.

36:15.278 --> 36:15.679
Yeah.

36:15.719 --> 36:16.920
Survive the nature.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.404
It's not spooky at all.

36:22.244 --> 36:22.924
Yeah!

36:22.944 --> 36:24.005
Okay, good!

36:25.085 --> 36:28.885
And then on Friday, we have FUWAMOCO Morning, of course.

36:29.266 --> 36:37.367
And then in the evening, we're gonna be watching some very, very funny clips from HoloGTA, talking about it, going over it.

36:37.707 --> 36:44.348
And please, we'll also ask on Twitter for your favorite clips from HoloGTA that are subtitled in English as well.

36:44.388 --> 36:48.769
So please, please send them to us because that'll make things a lot easier.

36:49.589 --> 36:51.832
It would be best if it could be under 10 minutes.

36:51.852 --> 36:52.172
Yes!

36:52.692 --> 36:54.835
Even better if it could be under 3 minutes.

36:55.295 --> 36:56.857
Or under 5 at least.

36:56.897 --> 36:57.117
Yeah.

36:57.561 --> 36:59.582
There's a lot of clips.

37:00.122 --> 37:02.523
So please tag your favorite ones, okay?

37:02.683 --> 37:10.086
And then on Saturday, we're gonna be playing the legendary visual novel Fate Stay Night all together for the very first time.

37:10.126 --> 37:10.526
Yeah!

37:10.986 --> 37:12.827
For the GTA, does it have to be FUWAMOCO?

37:12.887 --> 37:14.387
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37:14.507 --> 37:14.968
Anybody.

37:15.768 --> 37:17.469
Yeah, not this FUWAMOCO.

37:17.489 --> 37:18.309
Not this FUWAMOCO.

37:18.349 --> 37:20.450
That would be a little bit embarrassing.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.971
That would be embarrassing!

37:23.011 --> 37:26.312
Yeah, everybody, but please in English sometime.

37:26.832 --> 37:28.834
I say die!

37:28.975 --> 37:32.218
I don't think anyone could do that.

37:50.828 --> 37:51.189
BAU BAU!

37:51.249 --> 37:57.116
I'll see you next week!

37:57.177 --> 38:02.524
For the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO reward!

38:02.744 --> 38:05.948
It's BAU BAU Strawberry Cream Soda!

38:06.068 --> 38:07.350
BAU BAU!

38:08.752 --> 38:15.777
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

38:16.198 --> 38:22.843
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

38:23.283 --> 38:24.424
Kitsuneko!

38:24.704 --> 38:26.146
BAU BAU!

38:26.266 --> 38:27.066
Mystic Mike!

38:27.527 --> 38:28.928
BAU BAU!

38:29.028 --> 38:29.768
Bossy Up!

38:30.249 --> 38:31.790
BAU BAU!

38:32.090 --> 38:33.051
Viper Blade!

38:33.371 --> 38:34.753
BAU BAU!

38:34.833 --> 38:35.053
Gokoma!

38:35.093 --> 38:35.513
BAU BAU!

38:37.718 --> 38:41.903
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

38:54.080 --> 39:02.348
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

39:02.869 --> 39:05.612
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

39:05.632 --> 39:07.654
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!
