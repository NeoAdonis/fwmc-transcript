04:52.846 --> 04:58.589
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

04:52.846 --> 04:58.589
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

04:59.029 --> 05:06.573
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:06.913 --> 05:10.315
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:10.495 --> 05:13.917
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:14.257 --> 05:19.020
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:19.400 --> 05:21.241
Thank you for joining us for our

05:21.881 --> 05:24.422
Fifth episode!

05:25.102 --> 05:27.403
Already fifth.

05:27.903 --> 05:29.163
Can you believe it?

05:29.203 --> 05:37.626
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

05:37.726 --> 05:39.986
FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:40.546 --> 05:42.927
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

05:42.947 --> 05:48.549
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.073
Please, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

05:52.213 --> 05:54.376
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

05:54.396 --> 05:55.718
FUWAMOCO MORNING!

05:56.459 --> 06:00.225
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:00.245 --> 06:00.625
BAU BAU!

06:05.066 --> 06:05.546
Ruffians.

06:06.067 --> 06:06.507
BAU BAU!

06:07.267 --> 06:08.008
Are you awake?

06:08.748 --> 06:09.349
BAU BAU!

06:09.629 --> 06:10.350
BAU BAU!

06:11.370 --> 06:12.731
Well, let's go right to things.

06:13.672 --> 06:14.953
There's important news!

06:15.013 --> 06:16.634
There's been a Pero Sighting!

06:16.654 --> 06:18.595
De-den!

06:19.316 --> 06:21.897
You remember how we said we haven't seen him for a little while?

06:21.977 --> 06:22.298
Right!

06:22.658 --> 06:24.119
A Ruffian spotted him!

06:24.979 --> 06:29.002
He has reported that he was seen in the Yellowstone National Park.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.503
Yellowstone National Park.

06:30.563 --> 06:32.684
This is America, right?

06:32.744 --> 06:33.265
America.

06:33.445 --> 06:34.626
Why is he in America?

06:35.226 --> 06:36.147
That's a good question.

06:36.928 --> 06:38.729
Do you have any ideas, Ruffians?

06:40.070 --> 06:41.752
Why would he want to be here?

06:42.392 --> 06:42.672
And look!

06:42.933 --> 06:44.534
He's taking a bath.

06:44.814 --> 06:45.555
That's good.

06:45.575 --> 06:49.538
He can probably use a bath if he went all the way to America.

06:49.558 --> 06:52.301
I have a feeling though that's not what you're supposed to do there.

06:54.076 --> 06:55.177
Safety is important.

06:55.237 --> 06:55.457
Right?

06:55.517 --> 06:56.897
People might get mad though, you know?

06:56.937 --> 06:59.619
It's not a good influence to others.

06:59.959 --> 07:05.162
If you just wanted to take a nice outdoor soak, you should visit a proper onsen in Japan, right?

07:05.282 --> 07:06.923
Maybe this isn't the place.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.084
Maybe he just wanted it a bit hotter, right?

07:10.885 --> 07:12.405
It's not an onsen!

07:14.805 --> 07:15.586
He's chilling!

07:15.646 --> 07:16.788
He looks kind of warm.

07:16.909 --> 07:20.715
Maybe he just wanted a very intense soak.

07:20.775 --> 07:21.797
Down to the bones.

07:21.817 --> 07:22.578
To the bones?

07:22.838 --> 07:24.040
Wait, that's a good question.

07:24.061 --> 07:25.242
Does Pero have bones?

07:27.025 --> 07:27.667
We haven't checked.

07:30.673 --> 07:37.357
Well, Ruffians, I don't know if we would head to Yellowstone National Park if we'd be able to reach Pero in time.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.819
So let us know where you see him next, okay?

07:41.719 --> 07:43.900
Let us know if you have any Pero Sightings, okay?

07:44.040 --> 07:47.662
Use the hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

07:47.702 --> 07:48.763
Let's keep an eye on him.

07:49.443 --> 07:51.605
This is gonna be a bit of a chase, I think.

07:51.665 --> 07:52.305
BAU BAU!

07:57.527 --> 07:58.488
Straight into things.

07:59.108 --> 07:59.888
Straight into things.

07:59.928 --> 08:03.450
We had to go straight into things again today.

08:03.830 --> 08:07.392
There's been a misunderstanding.

08:07.832 --> 08:11.833
But we never have misunderstandings.

08:12.094 --> 08:12.254
No.

08:12.334 --> 08:12.774
I don't know.

08:13.587 --> 08:27.126
While doing our first collab, Overcooked 2 with Biboo, there was a misunderstanding over Bijou's wonderful, hand-made, love-filled brownies that she gave us.

08:30.788 --> 08:34.770
In our debut, we mentioned that we don't really like chocolate.

08:35.570 --> 08:36.851
She found out.

08:37.491 --> 08:37.712
But!

08:38.412 --> 08:38.672
But!

08:38.692 --> 08:41.794
There's an important rule that we want you to understand, okay?

08:41.814 --> 08:43.294
You need to understand, okay?

08:43.495 --> 08:44.075
It's important.

08:44.495 --> 08:46.776
We mentioned it, but I don't think some ruffians would notice.

08:46.796 --> 08:47.537
It didn't get to you.

08:47.557 --> 08:49.338
That's why it's a misunderstanding.

08:49.778 --> 08:50.198
You know, if...

08:52.459 --> 09:01.281
Somebody that you love, somebody that's very important to you, no matter what, no matter if it's something you really dislike, you're like, I can't eat this.

09:01.681 --> 09:02.941
It'll be delicious!

09:03.521 --> 09:05.581
Because you know, they made it just for you.

09:05.621 --> 09:06.742
Yeah, it's filled with salt.

09:06.842 --> 09:07.802
Right!

09:07.882 --> 09:11.462
So, Ruffians, you know, this goes for you too.

09:11.742 --> 09:20.144
Because, you know, even if your mom, if she makes dinner for you and it's filled with maybe vegetables that you just really don't like,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.666
And if you really want to, you could just take them out.

09:43.055 --> 09:44.016
That's true.

09:44.176 --> 09:47.858
But you know, and that's why Biboo's brownie was so yummy!

09:48.699 --> 09:49.299
It was the best.

09:49.559 --> 09:51.441
It was filled with love, so it was okay.

09:53.902 --> 10:01.627
You know, also, I guess there were some Ruffians that were worried about if we were okay after eating it because of the chocolate.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.230
Yeah, but... Are you forgetting something though, Ruffians?

10:05.310 --> 10:05.750
I think so.

10:07.762 --> 10:09.804
You know, we're not just some silly dogs.

10:10.004 --> 10:10.184
No.

10:10.524 --> 10:11.685
We're demon dogs.

10:11.705 --> 10:12.565
Demon dogs.

10:12.586 --> 10:13.706
Demon dogs, okay?

10:13.726 --> 10:15.027
Chocolate's not gonna hurt us.

10:15.107 --> 10:15.327
No.

10:15.668 --> 10:17.489
It just doesn't taste very good, okay?

10:17.909 --> 10:18.410
Yeah.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.491
But regular dogs are different, okay?

10:20.851 --> 10:22.973
So please make sure they don't eat any chocolate.

10:22.993 --> 10:23.153
Yeah.

10:23.173 --> 10:23.433
Safety.

10:23.633 --> 10:33.320
No matter how much love that you maybe put into making it, I think maybe if you're gonna make chocolate, maybe make it for somebody else, or make it for yourself.

10:33.561 --> 10:34.041
Yeah.

10:34.081 --> 10:34.481
Yourself.

10:34.942 --> 10:35.242
You know?

10:35.262 --> 10:36.223
Can you make chocolate?

10:37.944 --> 10:39.344
It's like a new chocolate.

10:39.384 --> 10:39.905
From chocolate.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.225
A chocolate from chocolate.

10:41.245 --> 10:41.465
Yeah.

10:41.645 --> 10:43.705
You just put more love into it.

10:44.006 --> 10:45.126
Yeah, you know.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.446
That's the important ingredient.

10:46.806 --> 10:50.527
But yes, please make sure that you don't give dogs any chocolate.

10:50.787 --> 10:53.568
Make sure you give them a healthy balanced diet instead.

10:53.588 --> 10:54.368
Good food, okay?

10:54.628 --> 10:55.288
That's important.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.369
Very important.

10:56.869 --> 10:57.849
Demon dogs are different.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.069
Yeah, we're different, okay?

10:59.649 --> 11:00.149
Understood?

11:00.209 --> 11:01.210
We're not just a dog.

11:01.230 --> 11:02.350
We're demon dogs.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.110
Demon dogs.

11:03.310 --> 11:03.890
BAU BAU.

11:04.070 --> 11:04.451
BAU BAU.

11:07.372 --> 11:07.972
And that's it!

11:08.993 --> 11:13.594
No... This time we have a misunderstanding, but it's a bit different.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.716
It's a bit more of a happy misunderstanding.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.036
Happy misunderstanding!

11:19.056 --> 11:20.537
Is this a sting?

11:20.557 --> 11:22.118
I think so, this time.

11:22.758 --> 11:24.959
It's a different misunderstanding, you know?

11:25.459 --> 11:33.842
After our Rock'n'Roll Party last week, I think there was a bit of an influx of Ruffians comparing Moco-chan's voice, in particular Senchou-senpais.

11:33.882 --> 11:35.263
The Marine-senpais.

11:36.383 --> 11:37.143
But!

11:37.843 --> 11:42.304
Well, that's really a great, great, great, great compliment to us.

11:43.085 --> 11:47.166
I think Senchou-senpai herself, she said that she thinks differently.

11:47.186 --> 11:54.507
And Moco-chan's voice is similar to... Is it okay to say?

11:54.547 --> 12:00.489
Moco-chan's voice is similar to the legendary seiyuu Tange Sakura-san!

12:02.950 --> 12:03.510
I don't know.

12:03.790 --> 12:04.330
I don't know!

12:05.010 --> 12:07.231
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that.

12:07.271 --> 12:08.391
I don't think it's true.

12:08.411 --> 12:10.952
Do you think so, Ruffians?

12:11.152 --> 12:12.932
Do you know who Tange Sakura is?

12:12.972 --> 12:13.672
You know, right?

12:14.052 --> 12:14.532
You know.

12:14.853 --> 12:15.133
Nice.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.093
Right.

12:16.513 --> 12:17.073
Right.

12:17.273 --> 12:17.793
You know.

12:18.493 --> 12:20.234
We don't know Tange Sakura.

12:20.574 --> 12:27.275
She's the OG cute voice seiyuu behind characters like Kinomoto Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura.

12:27.355 --> 12:27.795
Oh, right.

12:27.875 --> 12:28.755
You know her, right?

12:29.136 --> 12:29.496
Right.

12:30.096 --> 12:31.076
That sounds similar.

12:32.824 --> 12:35.695
One second!

14:49.298 --> 14:50.779
Ruffians, we're back!

14:50.899 --> 14:56.442
We're sorry there were some technical issues with the broadcast today, but we fixed the signals.

14:56.702 --> 14:58.203
It's all good now.

14:58.323 --> 14:59.684
Thank you for waiting for us!

14:59.704 --> 15:00.484
Thank you!

15:02.185 --> 15:03.206
Where were we?

15:03.546 --> 15:05.307
Kage Sakura-chan!

15:05.607 --> 15:06.148
That's right.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.829
Okay, Ruffians, you know who she is, right?

15:08.849 --> 15:09.610
Kinomoto Sakura.

15:11.185 --> 15:11.865
You know, right?

15:11.965 --> 15:12.306
Right!

15:12.986 --> 15:13.346
Right!

15:14.406 --> 15:16.367
Of course, of course, right!

15:17.187 --> 15:21.149
Yes, she is the OG legendary seiyuu.

15:22.249 --> 15:27.972
But, I don't know, do you really think that someone like Moco-chan can be compared to her?

15:28.372 --> 15:29.012
I don't know.

15:29.032 --> 15:30.913
I don't know.

15:30.933 --> 15:32.693
Moco-chan, you are cute, but... Am I?

15:39.836 --> 15:41.997
Maybe Moco-chan, can you do like an impression?

15:42.677 --> 15:43.657
Impression!

15:43.777 --> 15:44.777
Sakura impression!

15:44.877 --> 15:48.858
Ruffians, would you like that?

15:50.838 --> 15:51.298
Yes!

15:51.358 --> 15:51.658
Yes!

15:52.398 --> 15:52.719
Okay.

15:53.279 --> 15:54.279
Do your best.

15:54.319 --> 15:55.379
I don't think it's gonna be.

15:55.459 --> 16:02.320
It doesn't sound like it.

16:07.284 --> 16:08.965
Weee!

16:09.865 --> 16:10.766
It didn't sound like you.

16:10.826 --> 16:12.046
No, not even close.

16:12.687 --> 16:14.728
No, I'm sorry, yeah.

16:15.508 --> 16:15.788
No.

16:15.928 --> 16:16.569
I tried.

16:17.029 --> 16:18.170
I tried.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.351
Ah, but thank you!

16:20.531 --> 16:26.454
Thank you so much Senchou-senpai for the amazing compliment that makes Moco-chan very happy, right?

16:26.594 --> 16:26.914
Right?

16:26.974 --> 16:27.394
Yeah.

16:27.514 --> 16:28.215
Thank you!

16:28.255 --> 16:31.736
Thank you for doing it!

16:32.177 --> 16:33.197
Well, next...

16:36.121 --> 16:37.982
There's something I have to confess about.

16:38.243 --> 16:38.943
Confession.

16:43.867 --> 16:54.655
The other day, you know, in the final part of the Typing of the Dead, there was one moment, you know, where Fuwawa let out a very big scream.

16:55.296 --> 16:57.818
In particular, a very blood-curdling scream.

16:57.838 --> 17:00.480
Did you notice it, Ruffians?

17:03.963 --> 17:04.163
Well...

17:05.486 --> 17:14.858
You know, as Fuwawa, you know, I'm actually very, very scared of fire.

17:15.799 --> 17:17.661
You know, I'm the fluffy one, right?

17:18.102 --> 17:20.925
So, it makes sense.

17:21.566 --> 17:21.806
Maybe...

17:22.708 --> 17:25.290
I'm a little bit more flammable than Moco-chan.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.031
You're just fuzzy.

17:26.071 --> 17:27.392
Yeah, I'm just fuzzy.

17:28.934 --> 17:36.060
But yeah, that's why I was really scared when we went into the scary incinerator and then there's the fire.

17:36.761 --> 17:39.043
I have nightmares like that, you know?

17:39.223 --> 17:42.726
So when I noticed that the door closed and that we were locked in...

17:44.467 --> 17:45.908
Please scream more!

17:56.547 --> 18:00.629
But yes, Ruffians, please be extra extra careful with fire.

18:01.389 --> 18:03.370
You know, it's warm, and it's bright.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.730
Yeah, warm things are good.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.671
It's also very destructive, too.

18:06.691 --> 18:07.971
Yeah, you have to be careful.

18:09.592 --> 18:14.434
Actually, Moco-chan, you know, in Rebellion, you sing the Fire Fire Light the Fire.

18:14.554 --> 18:17.315
Even that makes me a bit concerned when you say that.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.095
No fire, please!

18:19.175 --> 18:19.856
Only, I guess,

18:20.996 --> 18:21.477
Yeah, water.

18:21.497 --> 18:23.480
Be prepared just in case, you know.

18:23.500 --> 18:23.880
Safety.

18:36.997 --> 18:42.079
If I see one, I go into protect mode, so I've actually put out a lot of fires in my time.

18:43.699 --> 18:46.700
But Ruffians, they weren't Moco-chan's fault.

18:47.180 --> 18:50.661
Ruffians, don't give me any reasons to put out more fires, okay?

18:50.941 --> 18:52.482
No more fires.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.886
I haven't put any fires.

18:56.006 --> 18:57.788
I'm not spicy.

18:59.831 --> 19:01.053
Usually it just happens.

19:02.014 --> 19:03.917
It's just kind of scary in itself, right?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.700
Be careful with fire, okay?

19:06.200 --> 19:06.781
It's serious.

19:06.881 --> 19:07.302
Got it?

19:07.362 --> 19:08.604
Serious, serious, serious.

19:11.187 --> 19:17.932
Well, we thought, you know, we've heard a lot of different opinions and questions.

19:18.272 --> 19:19.893
We've spent over a week with you now.

19:19.973 --> 19:21.114
Almost two weeks.

19:21.514 --> 19:23.476
But we're still hearing a lot of questions.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.278
What is BAU BAU?

19:27.619 --> 19:28.740
Ruffians, do you know?

19:28.760 --> 19:29.660
Do you understand yet?

19:29.700 --> 19:30.481
What do you think you know?

19:30.501 --> 19:32.763
I want to hear the Ruffians' opinion first.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.004
What is BAU BAU?

19:34.084 --> 19:35.304
What is BAU BAU to you?

19:35.324 --> 19:36.625
Do you have the answers?

19:37.657 --> 19:38.278
Do you know?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.098
BAU BAU.

19:39.339 --> 19:39.759
BAU BAU.

19:40.239 --> 19:40.940
BAU BAU is life.

19:41.280 --> 19:41.881
BAU BAU BAU.

19:42.041 --> 19:42.501
BAU BAU.

19:42.822 --> 19:43.382
BAU BAU.

19:43.843 --> 19:44.984
Not BORK BORK.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.625
BAU BAU.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.267
No, that's a different dialect.

19:49.689 --> 19:56.013
I know we've heard a lot of voices from Ruffians being like, oh well, BAU BAU means stink in Indonesia, I think.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.633
I think Malay too.

19:58.174 --> 20:00.935
But, BAU BAU is BAU BAU.

20:01.115 --> 20:02.096
Just BAU BAU.

20:02.296 --> 20:04.417
BAU BAU is how Demon Dogs talk.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.298
BAU BAU.

20:06.638 --> 20:11.060
It's kind of hard for us to get rid of the habit of saying BAU BAU.

20:12.281 --> 20:13.041
Does it bug you?

20:13.201 --> 20:15.302
Do you think we should stop?

20:15.382 --> 20:15.943
Should we stop?

20:18.100 --> 20:18.400
BAU BAU!

20:18.420 --> 20:18.580
BAU BAU!

20:18.621 --> 20:18.881
BAU BAU!

20:32.458 --> 20:33.999
No!

20:35.339 --> 20:36.039
I'm glad!

20:36.099 --> 20:37.000
It's good, it's good.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.601
But yes, BAU BAU means BAU BAU!

20:39.641 --> 20:40.541
Yeah, BAU BAU.

20:40.701 --> 20:42.342
You know BAU BAU when you're excited?

20:42.362 --> 20:44.043
Yeah, BAU BAU when you're scared?

20:44.063 --> 20:46.183
BAU BAU when you're sad too?

20:46.624 --> 20:48.544
BAU BAU all the time together with you!

20:48.564 --> 20:49.325
Yeah, yeah.

20:49.445 --> 20:49.785
BAU BAU.

20:49.945 --> 20:51.286
It can mean lots of things, you know?

20:51.306 --> 20:52.626
Like, good luck!

20:52.886 --> 20:53.967
BAU BAU!

20:54.267 --> 20:54.827
I love you!

20:54.907 --> 20:55.427
BAU BAU!

20:55.447 --> 20:56.488
Do your best!

20:56.648 --> 20:57.128
BAU BAU!

20:58.028 --> 20:58.869
We're rooting for you!

20:58.969 --> 20:59.549
BAU BAU!

20:59.609 --> 21:01.550
That's lots of different things, you know.

21:01.690 --> 21:02.491
It's BAU BAU.

21:04.452 --> 21:13.898
Hopefully, you know, maybe if BAU BAU is still a bit new to you, it will translate and you'll eventually be able to understand what we mean through our BAU BAUs.

21:14.098 --> 21:14.338
Yeah.

21:15.059 --> 21:15.459
BAU BAU.

21:15.699 --> 21:17.100
Ruffians, do you think you have it?

21:18.550 --> 21:26.274
I think I see some ruffians that kind of understand, but maybe some ruffians that are still getting the hang of BAU BAU.

21:26.314 --> 21:26.674
That's okay.

21:26.754 --> 21:27.715
It's a process.

21:28.195 --> 21:30.596
Eventually, you'll be BAU BAUing just like us.

21:30.696 --> 21:31.937
Yeah, it's just a process.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.718
It'll be okay.

21:34.478 --> 21:34.698
Yeah.

21:35.038 --> 21:35.719
That's BAU BAU.

21:35.759 --> 21:36.679
That's BAU BAU.

21:38.680 --> 21:43.663
Also, this upcoming weekend is a very special weekend.

21:44.383 --> 21:45.444
You know what it is, ruffians?

21:45.464 --> 21:46.945
I don't know what the ruffians know.

21:48.689 --> 21:51.212
It's Comiket 102!

21:51.773 --> 21:55.898
Do you know what Comiket is?

21:55.958 --> 21:59.143
Comiket is short for Comic Market.

21:59.363 --> 22:03.028
It's the biggest doujinshi market event.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.729
It's held twice a year in Japan.

22:04.769 --> 22:06.811
It's held during summer and winter.

22:06.831 --> 22:08.812
For fan comics.

22:08.872 --> 22:16.697
It's really really fun, but it can also be quite an intense battle to get sought after books and merchandise before they sell out.

22:16.737 --> 22:18.319
Yeah, it's not easy sometimes.

22:18.359 --> 22:21.721
You know, if there's something you specifically want, you have to fight.

22:21.961 --> 22:23.042
Fight, fight, yeah.

22:23.823 --> 22:31.550
But we hope that you know any ruffians heading out to the battlefield, that you're well prepared, especially for the heat, to know where you're going.

22:31.570 --> 22:37.677
Please make sure that you get lots of food, lots of water, and to have a balanced breakfast before you leave the cave.

22:37.697 --> 22:39.078
You need to power yourself.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.259
Fuel.

22:40.980 --> 22:46.025
Also, if you see any FUWAMOCO books, please let us know.

22:47.346 --> 22:48.047
Okay!

22:48.927 --> 22:53.669
You know, but it'd be really, really crazy to have something up so quickly.

22:53.729 --> 23:02.053
You know, it's just our second week here with you, but we also want to get our paws on them too.

23:02.073 --> 23:05.795
If you see any, make sure you BAU BAU at them for being really crazy, okay?

23:05.815 --> 23:07.456
They're too crazy fast.

23:07.496 --> 23:09.097
That's a crazy ruffian.

23:09.297 --> 23:12.078
But most importantly, make sure you pick one up too, okay?

23:12.118 --> 23:12.999
Make sure you get one.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.802
Good luck and happy NatsuComi!

23:17.483 --> 23:20.025
Shall we head to our regular segment today, Moco-chan?

23:20.045 --> 23:24.049
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

23:30.424 --> 23:30.864
De-den!

23:31.765 --> 23:34.187
It's Sissel!

23:34.708 --> 23:35.268
Sissel!

23:35.288 --> 23:39.772
She's a very particular, peculiar looking doggy.

23:40.052 --> 23:40.813
Very cute though.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.134
But very cute nonetheless, right?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.075
Super duper cute even.

23:43.335 --> 23:45.457
She kind of looks like, a bit delicious.

23:45.577 --> 23:46.197
Delicious.

23:46.338 --> 23:47.599
Especially delicious.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.100
It's yummy smell.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.243
You know, a beautiful grey lover.

23:52.263 --> 23:54.785
Splashed with a bit of milk across the chest.

23:54.845 --> 23:55.585
Very good.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.306
Yum yum.

23:57.326 --> 23:58.286
Yum yum.

23:58.526 --> 24:01.667
I wanna just put my face right in.

24:01.727 --> 24:02.227
Right!

24:02.507 --> 24:08.088
And there's some really cute side ruffles that look especially groveled on.

24:08.388 --> 24:14.430
And we have some, you can't really quite see here, but we have the faintly, faintly pink cute little lips.

24:14.630 --> 24:15.530
And the noise!

24:15.910 --> 24:17.410
Very, very kissable lips.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.291
Lots of kisses, lots of kisses.

24:21.171 --> 24:24.952
Ruffians, maybe, what do you think this little BAU BAU is like?

24:26.718 --> 24:27.238
What do you think?

24:27.338 --> 24:30.739
Usually we think of it, but... Yeah.

24:31.019 --> 24:31.660
BAU BAU.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.900
Doggie of the Day.

24:32.960 --> 24:33.380
Sissel.

24:33.660 --> 24:34.140
Sissel.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.941
Sissel's a Doggie of the Day today.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.062
MOU MOU.

24:38.102 --> 24:38.722
MOU MOU.

24:38.742 --> 24:39.682
MOU MOU.

24:39.742 --> 24:40.963
MOU MOU.

24:41.183 --> 24:41.763
MOU BAU.

24:41.783 --> 24:42.463
MOU BAU.

24:42.483 --> 24:43.984
BAU MOU.

24:45.124 --> 24:47.505
Oh, Sissel has an interesting... BAU BAU.

24:48.545 --> 24:49.706
It's cute.

24:50.026 --> 24:51.886
It definitely sort of awakens something.

24:52.106 --> 24:52.486
Right?

24:52.526 --> 24:53.987
You know, I think...

24:54.497 --> 24:56.458
This is a doggy reading.

24:58.160 --> 25:02.422
A very peculiar looking doggy, but very, very cute.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.243
Delicious.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.625
I feel kind of like something similar to when I see a cat.

25:07.226 --> 25:10.628
I just need to... I need to do it.

25:11.048 --> 25:12.790
But this is a dog, though, you know?

25:13.050 --> 25:13.690
It's funny.

25:13.830 --> 25:15.011
It's funny to feel that way.

25:15.151 --> 25:17.293
Thank you!

25:17.413 --> 25:19.474
BAU BAU!

25:19.494 --> 25:23.557
Today, I went on a walk.

25:24.571 --> 25:28.355
We have... De-den!

25:28.895 --> 25:33.140
We went on a nice forest-y looking park jam maybe this time!

25:33.780 --> 25:35.822
This is a pretty silly sight.

25:36.223 --> 25:38.705
Their duty is your duty.

25:39.326 --> 25:43.610
The dog doesn't really look too happy that someone's digging underneath them for treasure.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.751
What treasure is there?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.475
Excuse me, Doggy marks the spot.

25:48.495 --> 25:51.818
He's just like, I'm sitting here.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.019
Please, please don't.

25:53.239 --> 25:53.659
Please don't.

25:53.679 --> 25:54.560
There's no treasure here.

25:54.820 --> 25:55.541
Excuse me.

25:56.041 --> 25:57.843
Could you stop, please?

25:58.523 --> 26:00.865
Yeah, let's give the dogs some peace though, you know?

26:00.905 --> 26:03.848
But we're glad you enjoyed the watch!

26:03.928 --> 26:06.390
BAU BAU!

26:08.111 --> 26:10.814
Next, for our Question of the Day,

26:12.991 --> 26:14.472
De-den!

26:15.292 --> 26:15.392
Oh!

26:15.412 --> 26:19.414
Today wasn't the greatest day for me, but your streams helped cheer me up.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.715
We're glad that we helped.

26:21.735 --> 26:25.137
So I'd like to ask, what do you two do when you're feeling down?

26:25.157 --> 26:26.657
When you're feeling down.

26:26.677 --> 26:29.479
This is a really good question too.

26:29.739 --> 26:31.960
We understand, you know, sometimes, no matter what,

26:32.620 --> 26:34.361
Just really can't help but feel a bit down.

26:34.401 --> 26:35.842
Yeah, some days are like that, you know.

26:36.043 --> 26:42.027
We have days like that too, but usually what we do is we think, okay, why am I feeling like this?

26:42.107 --> 26:43.368
What's making me feel bad?

26:43.528 --> 26:47.691
And then we sort of think about what we could do to make us feel better, you know, right?

26:47.851 --> 26:48.331
Fix things.

26:48.391 --> 26:57.178
Yeah, and sometimes it helps to talk to each other, you know, maybe Moco-chan's feeling a bit prickly and all we need is maybe a bit of an apology or to talk

26:59.358 --> 27:01.599
Sometimes, you know, a hard reset is necessary, too.

27:01.639 --> 27:05.440
You know, like, a nap to refresh everything, make you feel good again, you know?

27:05.860 --> 27:07.600
Start things fresh.

27:07.880 --> 27:15.222
But yes, you know, we always try to figure out what's making us feel off and do things better, you know?

27:15.582 --> 27:18.002
But if you can't, that's okay, too.

27:18.422 --> 27:20.643
Sometimes, you know, it's just out of your control.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.343
It's a bad date, you know?

27:22.663 --> 27:25.444
I think on those kind of days, maybe

27:26.291 --> 27:31.176
You could just, you know, curl up with a good cup of tea and a blanket.

27:31.476 --> 27:33.458
Maybe watch some anime that you really like.

27:33.478 --> 27:34.119
Play a game.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.642
You know, take a bath or go to bed early.

27:36.662 --> 27:38.604
You know, those sort of things.

27:38.644 --> 27:40.666
Just give yourself a bit more love and care.

27:41.487 --> 27:46.592
Times are rough sometimes, but you know, you don't have to be rough everything.

27:47.853 --> 27:49.254
Tomorrow's a new day.

27:49.474 --> 27:51.476
Maybe it'll be a new FUWAMOCO Morning.

27:51.616 --> 27:53.337
But maybe not!

27:54.658 --> 27:55.659
That's okay.

27:55.719 --> 27:59.021
Just take it every day, step by step, step by step.

27:59.522 --> 28:00.543
It'll be okay!

28:01.944 --> 28:02.704
Thank you!

28:02.744 --> 28:05.426
We hope that today will be a really good day.

28:05.486 --> 28:06.147
And you know what?

28:06.787 --> 28:08.549
It's not only just a FUWAMOCO Morning.

28:09.545 --> 28:10.466
Friday.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.230
Oh, you're gonna go like that?

28:16.892 --> 28:19.194
It's not just FUWAMOCO Morning today.

28:19.234 --> 28:20.896
It's not just a Friday today.

28:21.296 --> 28:22.857
We have another team.

28:22.877 --> 28:25.220
Our next team is...

28:26.564 --> 28:27.984
De-den!

28:28.365 --> 28:31.746
It's our weekly Advent Club!

28:32.166 --> 28:32.646
It's here.

28:33.386 --> 28:35.827
And this time, we're playing Earth Defense Force 5.

28:36.607 --> 28:37.727
Earth Defense Force 5.

28:38.487 --> 28:40.708
We have two games we're playing that's 5 this week.

28:41.148 --> 28:41.768
Oh, you're right!

28:44.829 --> 28:46.870
And today's the fifth episode of FUWAMOCO 40!

28:46.930 --> 28:47.370
It's... it's...

28:51.890 --> 28:52.030
Ume.

28:52.050 --> 28:53.271
Fate!

28:53.491 --> 28:54.011
It's fate.

28:55.832 --> 28:57.253
I thought you said it's Ume.

28:57.333 --> 29:02.495
But yes, we're playing Earth Defense Force 5.

29:02.955 --> 29:07.197
This is gonna be our first time playing it, but yes, we're excited.

29:07.297 --> 29:09.298
It looks pretty silly, pretty fun too.

29:09.378 --> 29:11.860
I don't really know what we're doing, but we're gonna protect everyone!

29:11.880 --> 29:13.240
Yeah, protect humanity.

29:13.661 --> 29:17.702
And, you know, Moco-chan and I, we've seen a little bit of Tokusatsu here and there.

29:17.762 --> 29:18.643
Is it like that?

29:18.723 --> 29:20.464
There's kaiju and stuff too, so...

29:21.064 --> 29:22.285
You know, I'm excited.

29:22.405 --> 29:29.747
I'm not too sure what to expect, but... You know, Admin will surely band together and will save all of humanity, so... Are we sure?

29:29.828 --> 29:32.168
Is Shiori gonna protect humanity or destroy it?

29:32.689 --> 29:33.509
That's a good question.

29:33.529 --> 29:35.410
We don't know.

29:35.430 --> 29:36.550
Never know with Shiori.

29:37.631 --> 29:39.011
And that's why we love her.

29:41.372 --> 29:42.072
Yeah, yeah.

29:42.353 --> 29:44.753
Well, let's take another peek at our schedule.

29:44.773 --> 29:47.555
Our schedule for the rest of the weekend.

29:47.735 --> 29:48.515
De-den!

29:50.745 --> 29:53.266
Moco-chan deshita deshita.

29:53.606 --> 29:59.029
It says next stream at the bottom.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.871
Next schedule, next stream.

30:02.211 --> 30:06.473
We have another FUWAMOCO Rock Cover Party coming up!

30:06.673 --> 30:10.155
This time we won't be singing old songs, new songs, old songs.

30:10.683 --> 30:14.005
We're singing only hololive songs.

30:14.345 --> 30:18.127
But to be honest, we're pretty nervous too.

30:18.427 --> 30:21.889
I hope, Moco-chan, that you don't get too tongue-tied on some songs.

30:21.929 --> 30:23.170
I'm gonna do my best.

30:23.710 --> 30:24.670
It might happen though.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.331
You don't believe in me.

30:27.252 --> 30:27.752
Ah, no!

30:28.292 --> 30:29.373
It'll be okay, right?

30:30.333 --> 30:30.814
Right, Ruffian?

30:30.854 --> 30:31.814
I'm gonna do my best.

30:32.595 --> 30:34.796
You like Moco-chan when she's tongue-tied too, right?

30:37.785 --> 30:40.786
You like me all the time?

30:41.326 --> 30:44.328
Particularly this time though, I would like you to show your cool side.

30:44.368 --> 30:45.928
Do your best, Tokei Moco-chan!

30:46.068 --> 30:46.748
I'll try!

30:48.909 --> 30:53.171
We'll also be appearing on Kiara-senpai's Holotalk interview that day.

30:53.831 --> 31:00.434
Kiara-senpai said actually that this time it's going to be a bit different from usual, so we're really excited.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.350
Please make sure that you don't miss it.

31:03.370 --> 31:06.231
It's gonna be over at Kiara-senpai's channel.

31:06.711 --> 31:08.012
It's not gonna be here, okay?

31:08.052 --> 31:09.612
Not here, that doesn't make sense.

31:09.652 --> 31:12.814
You have to go to Kiara-senpai's channel, okay?

31:13.754 --> 31:13.894
And!

31:14.535 --> 31:22.558
Also, we wanted to say a big thank you for all your votes for which language we should play for... Oh, which language we should play?

31:22.638 --> 31:25.039
Dang, Sakura was 5 on Sunday.

31:25.860 --> 31:26.620
I think with around 70?

31:26.660 --> 31:27.280
70% of the votes?

31:29.581 --> 31:34.267
At least the Japanese voice is wonderful!

31:34.287 --> 31:40.875
But more importantly, we really wanted to say thank you to all the ruffians for being so kind to each other.

31:40.915 --> 31:47.062
All the ruffians were so nice to each other, thinking about what all the ruffians would want rather than maybe what.

31:47.583 --> 31:48.544
That was kind of you.

31:48.684 --> 31:48.944
Yeah.

32:04.113 --> 32:06.095
Thank you so much for making us proud!

32:06.275 --> 32:08.136
Let's have lots of fun with Sakura Wars 5 on Sunday!

32:08.177 --> 32:08.997
The start of a new journey, right?

32:09.458 --> 32:10.278
Thank you so much!

32:22.248 --> 32:24.930
I guess we're approaching the end of our fifth FUWAMOCO Morning.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.091
It's gone by so fast.

32:27.832 --> 32:30.954
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us again today.

32:31.714 --> 32:40.400
There are many more FUWAMOCO Mornings to come, but before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

32:42.813 --> 32:49.037
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

32:49.057 --> 32:51.719
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

33:12.773 --> 33:14.391
BAU!
