00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:18.286
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:22.548
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:23.588
Together we are...

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:24.368
FUWAMOCO!

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:24.989
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.230
Today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.131
Thank you for joining us for our eighth episode!

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:28.391
Eighth!

00:05:47.487 --> 00:05:51.689
It's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:59.813

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:05.155
Please make sure to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:09.817
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:11.758
BAU BAU!

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:14.359
Ruffians!

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:15.680
Ruffians!

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:18.266
Ruffians!

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:19.026
Thank you!

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:24.129
Ruffians!

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880
Today!

00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:37.262
Today!

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:42.284
We reached 500,000 Ruffians on Youtube!

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:43.544
Thank you!

00:06:43.624 --> 00:06:46.025
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.727
Thank you so much for all your support.

00:06:49.507 --> 00:06:52.608
Ruffians, we couldn't have made it this far without you here.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:07:00.231
We wanted to get a little bit closer, but it's a very special moment today.

00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:00.811
Thank you.

00:07:01.172 --> 00:07:05.034
But we wanted to say a big thank you for all your support.

00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:12.078
And, you know, we couldn't have made it this far, you know, to have 1 million subscribers without your love and enthusiasm.

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:12.659
Yes!

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.240
So much happy BAU BAUs.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:23.285
We've really, really, really been touched and even a bit overwhelmed at times by all your heartfelt messages and comments that we've received from you.

00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:24.706
Yeah, we're really, really happy.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:31.752
You know, even though there has been some hard times here and there, it's mostly of our own doing though.

00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:36.856
But you know, the fun times far outweigh them.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.357
We know that you'll be always here.

00:07:39.198 --> 00:07:39.498
Right?

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:41.980
Supporting us a thousand percent, right?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.922
Right!

00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:45.443
It's been really fun.

00:07:45.463 --> 00:07:49.226
And all you Ruffians, you mean so much to us.

00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:51.188
You know, I think, you know,

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:56.557
We know that we mean a lot to you too, right?

00:07:57.278 --> 00:07:57.859
Maybe, right?

00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:16.168
But, you know, like, especially when you're maybe going through some hard times, just for us, thinking that even just by a little tiny bit that we're able to protect your smile when it needs protecting the most, it makes us feel really happy and really lucky to be able to do that.

00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:16.568
Yeah.

00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:21.149
We feel sort of like we found our life's calling.

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:22.010
Like we're home.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.370
Yeah.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.291
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:29.194
Thank you for giving us the job, the opportunity to do so.

00:08:30.235 --> 00:08:32.236
We're really thankful to have you here with us.

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:36.839
And of course, you know, we're really happy to have reached this halfway point.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:42.463
The halfway point of a very big goal.

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:49.668
But to be honest, too, even though it's a big goal, we really didn't think we'd be able to reach halfway like this already!

00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:49.788
Right?

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.538
It's important to have big goals like we do, but we also understand that they don't always come true.

00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:00.701
No matter how hard you work sometimes, you know?

00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:08.712
I think, you know, we're really big gamers, but we're also more on the pessimistic side of things recently.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:15.655
You know, we don't really want to get carried away and make ourselves disappointed when maybe things don't work out.

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:19.056
I feel like that's a thing we do often.

00:09:20.056 --> 00:09:21.816
Try not to get too excited, you know?

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:23.597
Because we get excited easily.

00:09:23.677 --> 00:09:25.517
Whenever we get ahead of ourselves.

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:27.338
So we don't want to get disappointed.

00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:29.178
But thank you, Ruffians.

00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:31.419
Thank you for showing us that it's okay to dream big.

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.160
And that maybe we don't need to be so pessimistic.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.821
Right?

00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:41.182
We want to be able to reach the 1 million goal, right?

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:45.483
But we want to prove ourselves through our hard work too.

00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:49.544
So the next 500,000 Ruffians, let's get there with hard work.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.225
And lots of smiles too.

00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:53.045
Of course.

00:09:54.226 --> 00:10:02.128
Most importantly, we really hope to spend many, many, many more days filled with laughter and happiness together with you.

00:10:02.948 --> 00:10:04.549
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:05.749
Thank you!

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:07.270
BAU BAU!

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.870
Has it been fun so far?

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.452
We're just about at three weeks now.

00:10:14.052 --> 00:10:16.293
It's been really fun for us.

00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:18.734
Yes!

00:10:19.254 --> 00:10:20.214
BAU BAU!

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:21.975
BAU BAU!

00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:23.816
Let's continue to work hard, okay?

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.616
Yeah, we need you here with us, okay?

00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:27.497
Is that okay?

00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:29.998
If you're here with us...

00:10:33.882 --> 00:10:34.002
Yes!

00:10:34.022 --> 00:10:34.663
BAU BAU!

00:10:34.683 --> 00:10:35.504
BAU BAU!

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:37.766
Thank you Ruffians!

00:10:38.466 --> 00:10:47.035
But we'll also have a proper celebration all together soon, so let's have a Rock n' Rawr party then.

00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:49.897
Or maybe even a bigger party?

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:50.979
A bigger party!

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:56.196
Thank you, Ruffian!

00:10:56.576 --> 00:11:04.918
In the meantime, let's continue to have lots of fun with FUWAMOCO Morning today!

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:08.279
Thank you, Ruffian!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.060
Thank you!

00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.661
We got some more information from Ruffian!

00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:17.922
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:11:18.522 --> 00:11:19.882
Where's Pero this time?

00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:28.332
The report says that Pero has been transported into the back room.

00:11:29.432 --> 00:11:31.673
Ruffians, do you know much about this place?

00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:33.193
The back room.

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:34.734
It looks like an office.

00:11:34.914 --> 00:11:36.795
Yeah, just like an office space.

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.415
Is it an empty apartment?

00:11:39.596 --> 00:11:41.236
Maybe Pero moved in here.

00:11:41.556 --> 00:11:43.997
Maybe it's just not furnished yet.

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:46.078
He's still trying to figure that part out, maybe?

00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:48.999
He can't move on his own, you know?

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:52.100
Is that the name of the apartment building in the backrooms?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.341
You know, sometimes they're called like... Fancy things, right?

00:11:54.501 --> 00:11:55.441
Yeah, you know.

00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:58.682
That kind of sounds like... The backrooms.

00:11:58.742 --> 00:12:00.463
It's just like a fancy apartment building.

00:12:00.503 --> 00:12:01.923
It does kind of look a bit typical.

00:12:01.943 --> 00:12:02.964
Not so fancy, but...

00:12:03.644 --> 00:12:08.606
You know, so like, I feel like maybe he just doesn't have the sort of luxury, you know?

00:12:08.666 --> 00:12:09.046
True.

00:12:09.487 --> 00:12:14.689
But out of all the places we've seen Pero at so far, I feel like this is like the easiest, you know?

00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:19.411
It's not on the roof of a cool mall or in the hands of a wizard.

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:19.751
Right?

00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:21.832
So maybe we can bring him back if we go there.

00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:23.933
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:12:24.473 --> 00:12:25.754
Should we try to find him?

00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:27.134
Do you think we can?

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:29.395
You know, hopefully.

00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:31.096
We can, and then... Save him!

00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:34.448
No.

00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:36.009
Why not?

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.210
Go save him.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.572
Do you not care about Pero enough?

00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:45.255
We're trying to get sightings so we can go get him, you know?

00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:47.656
Yeah, I feel like this is our best chance so far.

00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:56.041
Well, hopefully we can find him soon, but just in case we don't, please let us know if you have any more sightings, okay, Ruffians?

00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:59.603
Remember, use the hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:00.844
Thank you!

00:13:00.884 --> 00:13:02.245
BAU BAU!

00:13:06.888 --> 00:13:07.508
Ruffians.

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:14.229
There's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:13:14.309 --> 00:13:17.090
This time, it's pretty awful.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.691
Pretty awful, I think.

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:24.792
Pretty grave.

00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:29.193
This happened during our holoCure stream the other day.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.286
You know, certain events occurred... I need to clear my name, okay?

00:13:38.468 --> 00:13:39.369
Don't understand.

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:40.651
Okay!

00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.312
Misunderstand.

00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:43.774
Misunderstand.

00:13:43.974 --> 00:13:46.897
You are misunderstanding because you don't understand.

00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:47.658
Okay.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.264
I am not addicted to gacha, okay?

00:13:56.087 --> 00:14:00.329
You know, in fact, I'm not even the biggest fan of gacha games.

00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:04.550
It may seem like I've... Hey, no.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.330
No doubt.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:14.653
It may seem like I really wanted to spin for the gacha often, because I did, but all I wanted to do was unlock Ola-senpai as a playable character.

00:14:14.673 --> 00:14:18.014
You know, freedom from the digital version of the show, right?

00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:20.854
I kind of feel bad for them, you gotta respect the senpai.

00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:21.535
Exactly.

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:22.695
You know it.

00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:24.598
I like farming coins.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.004
And I like unlocking stuff.

00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:29.930
But does that mean that I'm addicted to gacha?

00:14:31.293 --> 00:14:31.914
It doesn't!

00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:32.776
No!

00:14:35.568 --> 00:14:37.468
Believe, not doubt.

00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:46.990
You know, I feel like the real game with gacha games, even, is to try to play and not spend that much money, you know?

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:52.772
You can be an exemplary free-to-play user, okay?

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:54.812
Yeah, free-to-play user.

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:55.592
That's all!

00:14:55.612 --> 00:14:57.413
I just needed you to understand, okay?

00:15:00.273 --> 00:15:04.396
I'm not addicted to anything except cute girls and cute cats, okay?

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.339
If it's cute girls and cute cats, then... Wait!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.582
What if there's a gacha game that's like cute girls and cute cats?

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:17.847
Not addicted to things.

00:15:18.788 --> 00:15:19.188
Okay!

00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:20.649
Ruffians, you understand?

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:21.310
You understand?

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.491
No misunderstanding!

00:15:22.591 --> 00:15:23.111
It's good!

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:23.171
No!

00:15:23.191 --> 00:15:23.231
No!

00:15:23.952 --> 00:15:25.973
No doubting!

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:32.932
You believe the words coming out of my mouth, right?

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:38.797
Ruffians, let's make sure not to get too carried away like Mocco-chan did there, okay?

00:15:39.577 --> 00:15:40.278
Understand?

00:15:40.298 --> 00:15:41.699
Good Ruffian.

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:43.560
Good Ruffian.

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:48.484
Sure, sure.

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:52.307
You know, Mocco-chan smiling, I think it's all cleared up now.

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:52.887
Clear.

00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:54.108
Mocco-chan.

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:56.610
Mococo is always right.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:56.750
Yes.

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.019
You had another dream, right?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.580
I did.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.782
I did.

00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:07.483
I did talk about it a bit.

00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:11.045
Today we got halfway to one big dream.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:15.567
But this was a sleeping dream.

00:16:16.948 --> 00:16:17.448
My dream.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.190
You haven't told me yet.

00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:26.233
I haven't told you, but... I did talk about it, but then I remembered that...

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.093
It was a bit embarrassing.

00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:30.373
What?!

00:16:32.277 --> 00:16:32.817
What?!

00:16:33.218 --> 00:16:34.480
I should've said nothing!

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.783
Oh no, Moco-chan.

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:37.285
I should've said nothing.

00:16:37.345 --> 00:16:37.826
Oh no!

00:16:42.563 --> 00:16:43.264
Don't be nervous!

00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:44.145
I'm nervous enough!

00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:45.606
If you're nervous, don't make me nervous!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:52.073
Okay, so, the other night, I had a dream that left me feeling like really refreshed in the morning.

00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:52.774
So it was a good dream!

00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:53.535
Oh, it's a good dream!

00:16:53.635 --> 00:16:54.235
The best dream!

00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:57.919
It wasn't very long, but it was sort of like, something like...

00:17:02.202 --> 00:17:03.963
I don't know, it's a bit embarrassing.

00:17:03.983 --> 00:17:05.364
I'm only gonna say it once, okay?

00:17:05.864 --> 00:17:06.925
Okay.

00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:08.766
Don't be nervous!

00:17:08.966 --> 00:17:09.867
Don't be nervous!

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:13.589
So, I was in an empty library.

00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:18.772
And I saw a Ruffian working on some sort of school project on a computer.

00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:20.833
So... An empty library?

00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:21.834
It wasn't that!

00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:22.695
I don't know if it was empty!

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:23.635
Was anybody else there?

00:17:23.656 --> 00:17:24.416
Could you see the dogs?

00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:25.197
There was other people.

00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:26.138
I think there was other people.

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:26.578
I don't know.

00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:27.278
They weren't alone.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:28.359
I wasn't alone.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.661
And it looked like they were struggling with it.

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:32.503
So then, I went over to help!

00:17:33.604 --> 00:17:36.226
I think it was like an English people or something like that.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:39.508
So then, I pulled up a chair, and I worked on it with them.

00:17:40.069 --> 00:17:41.770
And then, until it was all done.

00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:43.572
And then they were really happy!

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:45.673
And then I said, bye bye.

00:17:45.693 --> 00:17:47.094
And went to leave.

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:48.419
What?

00:17:48.459 --> 00:17:48.759
That's it?

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:48.919
What?

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:49.760
What?

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.140
What?

00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:50.681
What?

00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:50.901
What?

00:17:51.502 --> 00:17:51.682
What?

00:17:51.802 --> 00:17:51.922
What?

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:52.022
What?

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:52.162
What?

00:17:52.182 --> 00:17:52.302
What?

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:52.442
What?

00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:52.583
What?

00:17:52.623 --> 00:17:52.783
What?

00:17:52.803 --> 00:17:52.883
What?

00:17:53.343 --> 00:17:53.483
What?

00:17:53.924 --> 00:17:54.024
What?

00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:54.244
What?

00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:54.384
What?

00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:54.564
What?

00:17:54.604 --> 00:17:54.744
What?

00:17:54.764 --> 00:17:54.904
What?

00:17:54.984 --> 00:17:55.505
What?

00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:56.286
What?

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:56.386
What?

00:17:56.406 --> 00:17:56.566
What?

00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:57.827
What?

00:17:57.867 --> 00:17:57.987
What?

00:17:58.007 --> 00:17:58.227
What?

00:17:58.247 --> 00:17:58.367
What?

00:17:58.387 --> 00:17:58.607
What?

00:17:58.647 --> 00:17:58.788
What?

00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:58.948
What?

00:17:58.968 --> 00:17:59.108
What?

00:17:59.148 --> 00:17:59.368
What?

00:17:59.548 --> 00:17:59.688
What?

00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:00.089
What?

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.309
What?

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:00.429
What?

00:18:00.469 --> 00:18:00.649
What?

00:18:00.689 --> 00:18:00.849
What?

00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:01.550
What?

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:01.650
What?

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:02.411
What?

00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:02.671
What?

00:18:02.691 --> 00:18:02.851
What?

00:18:02.871 --> 00:18:03.011
What?

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:03.151
What?

00:18:03.171 --> 00:18:03.331
What?

00:18:03.371 --> 00:18:03.712
What?

00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:03.832
What?

00:18:03.852 --> 00:18:03.932
What?

00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:04.472
What?

00:18:04.532 --> 00:18:04.692
What?

00:18:04.712 --> 00:18:04.853
What?

00:18:04.873 --> 00:18:04.993
What?

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:05.153
What?

00:18:05.213 --> 00:18:05.333
What?

00:18:05.773 --> 00:18:05.954
What?

00:18:06.034 --> 00:18:06.254
What?

00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:06.534
What?

00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:06.694
What?

00:18:06.714 --> 00:18:06.814
What?

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:07.034
What?

00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:07.255
What?

00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:07.455
What?

00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:07.675
What?

00:18:07.695 --> 00:18:07.775
What?

00:18:08.335 --> 00:18:08.456
What?

00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:08.596
What?

00:18:08.636 --> 00:18:08.716
What?

00:18:08.736 --> 00:18:08.916
What?

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:09.036
What?

00:18:09.076 --> 00:18:09.156
What?

00:18:09.176 --> 00:18:09.336
What?

00:18:09.717 --> 00:18:09.957
What?

00:18:09.977 --> 00:18:10.157
What?

00:18:10.177 --> 00:18:10.277
What?

00:18:10.377 --> 00:18:10.577
What?

00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:10.697
What?

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:11.038
What?

00:18:11.058 --> 00:18:11.138
What?

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:11.318
What?

00:18:11.338 --> 00:18:11.438
What?

00:18:11.498 --> 00:18:11.618
What?

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:11.918
What?

00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:12.099
What?

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:12.259
What?

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:12.839
What?

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:12.959
What?

00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:13.079
What?

00:18:13.139 --> 00:18:13.380
What?

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.600
What?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:13.780
What?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:13.920
What?

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.080
What?

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.320
What?

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:14.440
What?

00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:14.581
What?

00:18:14.621 --> 00:18:14.941
What?

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:15.041
What?

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:15.201
What?

00:18:15.221 --> 00:18:15.301
What?

00:18:15.341 --> 00:18:15.501
What?

00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:15.601
What?

00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:15.802
What?

00:18:15.822 --> 00:18:16.042
What?

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:16.162
What?

00:18:16.822 --> 00:18:17.103
What

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.111
It wasn't... What happened?

00:18:21.131 --> 00:18:21.892
What happened?

00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:24.094
You don't... That wasn't you!

00:18:24.114 --> 00:18:24.194
What?

00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:25.275
What?

00:18:26.777 --> 00:18:30.320
Why is there an eggplant in this?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.540
What?

00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:32.482
Because there is!

00:18:32.502 --> 00:18:34.604
Dudes have eggplants in them.

00:18:34.665 --> 00:18:35.645
Dudes have eagles.

00:18:36.496 --> 00:18:37.937
So that's how it is!

00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:08.101
BAU BAU BYUL.

00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:11.626
Ruffians, have you been suffering?

00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:13.649
Suffering some weird symptoms?

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.831
Maybe you've been feeling a bit funny too.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.455
Maybe it's BAU BAU BYUL.

00:19:20.885 --> 00:19:36.051
Well, to explain a bit about BAU BAU, you know, it seems that it's brand new, but it's been recently discovered maybe sometime around the beginning of this month.

00:19:36.071 --> 00:19:42.654
There's still a lot that's unknown about it, but at least the early stages of it shows, you know, that

00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:45.636
People start to be affected to colors.

00:19:45.696 --> 00:19:46.396
Colors!

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:46.877
Colors.

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:47.817
That's just the start.

00:19:48.318 --> 00:19:49.178
That's just the start.

00:19:49.218 --> 00:19:49.759
It gets worse.

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:50.719
But let me explain.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:20:00.126
You know, sometimes you see something that's blue and something that's pink and then right away two dogs come into your mind and you can't think of anything else.

00:20:01.991 --> 00:20:03.352
That's the warning sign, okay?

00:20:03.612 --> 00:20:08.376
You know, and you start to feel a bit of a familiarity, a warmsness.

00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:13.620
Just because you see those two colors together, maybe you feel like a little bit happy too.

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:17.543
You understand, you felt that, you felt that, you had that.

00:20:18.003 --> 00:20:19.684
Oh my gosh, it's good that you're here right now.

00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:20.624
It's a warning sign, okay.

00:20:20.664 --> 00:20:20.864
Yeah.

00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:23.986
But then... That's just the beginning, you know?

00:20:24.206 --> 00:20:28.849
Sometimes, you can even also start to feel an intense pain in your stomach.

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:29.269
Yeah.

00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:31.590
While laughing uncontrollably.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.173
And your cheeks hurt because you can no longer control your facial muscles.

00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:39.234
You know, you're just smiling constantly and you lose control.

00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:40.695
You have no control anymore.

00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:41.596
Yeah.

00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:43.597
Oh no, your tummy hurts!

00:20:44.237 --> 00:20:44.738
Watch out!

00:20:44.798 --> 00:20:45.919
Watch out!

00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:47.039
Why don't you have it?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:58.888
Well, later reports, they show that, you know, as it progresses, some Ruffians start BAU BAUing during inappropriate situations and places and time.

00:20:59.148 --> 00:21:10.416
You know, sometimes at other dogs and cats, sometimes at other friends, family too, maybe teachers or workplace bosses, even at police officers and firefighters.

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:12.534
No, right.

00:21:12.914 --> 00:21:13.414
Ruffians.

00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:14.996
Not you, right?

00:21:15.016 --> 00:21:16.196
Ruffians.

00:21:16.657 --> 00:21:17.517
You okay, right?

00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:18.378
Is it contagious?

00:21:18.558 --> 00:21:19.179
I'm not sure!

00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:19.979
We don't know!

00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:21.400
It's still new.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.941
We're doomed!

00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:22.761
We're doomed!

00:21:24.342 --> 00:21:26.044
Have you been suffering?

00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:27.665
Are you suffering?

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.706
What are we gonna do, Moco-chan?

00:21:29.947 --> 00:21:30.787
This isn't good!

00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:33.770
Do you need a cure, Ruffians?

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.411
You need treatment!

00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:36.612
Treatment?

00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:38.713
We'll have to ask the scientists.

00:21:42.285 --> 00:21:43.386
An absolute win!

00:21:43.406 --> 00:21:44.387
Oh, wait.

00:21:45.427 --> 00:21:46.148
Can we howl?

00:21:46.268 --> 00:21:47.449
Is it good, then?

00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:48.149
Is it good?

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.571
No cure for you, you're done!

00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:55.134
Well, you know... I know you're fine.

00:21:55.775 --> 00:22:03.340
But if that's the case, you know... I guess the BAU BAUing part might be a bit embarrassing, but... Try to control the symptoms, okay?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.161
Ruffians aren't really suffering.

00:22:05.502 --> 00:22:08.284
We don't know the cure yet, but let's try to find something.

00:22:08.324 --> 00:22:09.545
If you're happy and smiling, then...

00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:11.066
Maybe it's okay?

00:22:11.106 --> 00:22:13.308
But if you hurt because of it, then it's no good.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.132
It's a very complicated new disease.

00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:21.334
We'll have to find out more!

00:22:21.754 --> 00:22:24.576
Ruffians, let us know how you're doing, okay?

00:22:24.616 --> 00:22:26.718
BAU BAU BYOU can be serious.

00:22:26.998 --> 00:22:28.799
Don't suffer on your own, okay?

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:30.300
Let somebody know.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.081
Today...

00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:39.733
We're gonna go back to our regular corner.

00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:42.954
We have our Doggie of the Day.

00:22:42.974 --> 00:22:44.634
Who's the doggy today?

00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:46.995
It's Monja!

00:22:48.396 --> 00:22:51.257
Monja is the Doggie of the Day.

00:22:51.277 --> 00:22:54.718
She's a little bit on the upside of the ears, but I think

00:22:55.018 --> 00:23:00.203
You know, we can all kind of see, but she loves to see just as much as any other puppy.

00:23:00.244 --> 00:23:01.044
Young at heart.

00:23:01.585 --> 00:23:01.805
Yeah.

00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:10.694
Apparently, she's not the best guard dog since she probably just cuddle with the bad guys, but I kind of understand that a bit, right, Moco-chan?

00:23:10.734 --> 00:23:10.954
Yeah.

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.296
We've gotten better though, right?

00:23:12.336 --> 00:23:17.161
Sometimes the bad guys are just scary, so then... It's useless.

00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:17.561
Yeah.

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:20.583
But you know, she's looking pretty right here.

00:23:20.603 --> 00:23:22.664
She just had a bunch of fun!

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:23.365
What do you think?

00:23:23.385 --> 00:23:25.346
Do you think Don-chan smells like a wet dog?

00:23:25.586 --> 00:23:26.126
Moco-chan.

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:28.907
Yeah.

00:23:30.508 --> 00:23:30.788
Yeah.

00:23:32.509 --> 00:23:32.769
Yeah.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.492
I kinda think that... Don-chan, she smells like a good wet dog though.

00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:39.513
Maybe more like a marshmallow.

00:23:39.573 --> 00:23:41.514
Like a toasted marshmallow wet dog.

00:23:41.554 --> 00:23:42.574
Like a cinnamon smell.

00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:44.715
You know, cinnamon and butter.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.281
How does Monja, how does she BAU BAU?

00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:55.602
I think you'd be somewhat reserved.

00:23:55.622 --> 00:24:02.384
Do you think that she swallows seawater sometimes?

00:24:02.444 --> 00:24:03.844
What does it sound like?

00:24:04.084 --> 00:24:05.645
I think she does, because it's fun.

00:24:05.685 --> 00:24:06.645
Just for the heck of it.

00:24:07.025 --> 00:24:08.366
What does it sound like, Moco-chan?

00:24:13.346 --> 00:24:14.247
Like that!

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:14.527
Like that!

00:24:37.864 --> 00:24:38.665
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:41.727
What are we gonna be?

00:24:43.329 --> 00:24:44.490
What are we gonna be?

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.930
Occha!

00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:46.972
Very good!

00:24:50.575 --> 00:24:51.155
Very good.

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:52.616
Very good.

00:24:53.077 --> 00:24:55.719
I think she's the definition of a sweetie, right?

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.921
A very lovely girl.

00:24:58.001 --> 00:24:58.481
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:58.702 --> 00:24:59.362
Never mean.

00:24:59.762 --> 00:25:01.043
Never mean.

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:03.666
Thank you!

00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:04.927
BAU BAU!

00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:05.988
Next!

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.721
Today!

00:25:08.221 --> 00:25:09.482
I went on a walk.

00:25:09.762 --> 00:25:11.243
What kind of walk did we go on today?

00:25:11.483 --> 00:25:13.805
De-den!

00:25:14.405 --> 00:25:14.905
Sunset!

00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:17.807
That's a beautiful sunset.

00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:19.709
Nice.

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:22.110
We're so happy that you went out.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.052
You had a nice time with your mom too.

00:25:25.472 --> 00:25:25.673
Yes!

00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:29.615
We're sure that she was really happy to have that time together with you.

00:25:29.635 --> 00:25:30.676
Good memories.

00:25:31.178 --> 00:25:33.100
And you had cheese corn!

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.041
I hope it was yummy.

00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:36.522
What is cheese corn like?

00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:40.025
Like cheese popcorn!

00:25:40.565 --> 00:25:42.046
Like a cheesy coin.

00:25:43.427 --> 00:25:44.167
I'm curious!

00:25:45.048 --> 00:25:46.749
I hope it was yummy!

00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:49.990
I think the world is definitely rewarding you with that sunset too.

00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:54.673
You know, just a beautiful sunset to the end of a beautiful day is perfect.

00:25:54.873 --> 00:25:55.734
I'm so happy!

00:25:56.014 --> 00:25:57.455
I feel so happy!

00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:01.197
Thank you, thank you for sharing your warmth with us.

00:26:01.537 --> 00:26:01.777
BAU BAU!

00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:15.271
Do you two ever have trouble falling or staying asleep?

00:26:15.712 --> 00:26:17.454
What do you do when you have sleep problems?

00:26:17.494 --> 00:26:19.637
Tweeting this at 1.30am.

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:20.458
I get it.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.422
Ah, we... Sometimes too.

00:26:24.762 --> 00:26:27.364
I'm a really heavy sleeper usually.

00:26:27.924 --> 00:26:28.485
You know it.

00:26:28.725 --> 00:26:29.826
But we sleep different.

00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:30.446
I don't know.

00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:34.029
You're half heavy sleeper, half light sleeper.

00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:34.349
Yeah.

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:41.874
Because sometimes, if you're not fully asleep yet, and I just slightly move, then you go, Mococo!

00:26:41.894 --> 00:26:42.635
Be quiet!

00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:50.180
I'll be, I'm hot, I'm asleep, but why are you yelling at me?

00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:54.020
I'm just moving slightly.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.222
Yeah, apparently I can be pretty angry when I try to sleep.

00:26:58.262 --> 00:26:58.422
Yes!

00:26:58.502 --> 00:27:00.503
She's very angry when she's sleeping.

00:27:00.523 --> 00:27:01.644
Very angry.

00:27:01.664 --> 00:27:02.504
Sleep is important.

00:27:02.544 --> 00:27:03.505
Sleep is important.

00:27:05.276 --> 00:27:13.261
But, yes, sometimes, you know, when we have a hard time falling asleep, you know, usually it's because there's just too many thoughts swirling around inside our head, you know?

00:27:13.521 --> 00:27:18.805
We do that thing, too, you know, when you think about all the things that you said to others, like, like our senpai, you know?

00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:21.627
Like, the things you say in a day, and we kind of freak ourselves out.

00:27:21.647 --> 00:27:24.028
We know it's not good, but... Right?

00:27:24.208 --> 00:27:26.110
I'm sure Ruffians, you do that, too, right?

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.931
Nobody else is thinking about it, but...

00:27:28.371 --> 00:27:29.793
You can't help but worry sort of day, you know?

00:27:29.833 --> 00:27:32.135
Oh I said that and maybe that was weird!

00:27:32.215 --> 00:27:33.336
Oh yeah that was weird!

00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:34.557
Maybe they misunderstood that!

00:27:34.597 --> 00:27:36.979
Maybe that should be in the misunderstanding corner!

00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:37.360
Right?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.400
Yeah.

00:27:38.441 --> 00:27:40.603
But we have strategies too, you know?

00:27:40.623 --> 00:27:43.845
We try to stretch before bed, or take like a warm bath.

00:27:43.886 --> 00:27:44.426
Yeah.

00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:46.808
Drink hot water, just drink hot water is good too.

00:27:46.868 --> 00:27:48.550
It's good for you.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.014
We'll try to put on a relaxing music, like hololive music studio songs.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.325
We really like using warm heating beds with eye masks as well.

00:28:02.626 --> 00:28:06.089
We have a special light that makes us even more sleepy too.

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:08.351
Moco-chan bought it.

00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:09.092
It's the best.

00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:15.700
But yes, putting away your phone far away is important too, I think.

00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:20.107
You know your sleep is number one, so the phone, it can wait until the morning, you know?

00:28:20.187 --> 00:28:21.669
Even if it goes buzz buzz.

00:28:21.709 --> 00:28:22.170
They can wait.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.433
Just think about the priorities.

00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:25.735
You need to get your sleep right.

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:33.795
I feel like, you know, it's kind of weird, but when we have a hard time falling asleep, generally, we both do.

00:28:33.995 --> 00:28:34.235
Yeah.

00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:36.876
Like, it's not just like, ah, Moco-chan, I can't sleep.

00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:37.977
You know, it's both of us.

00:28:38.037 --> 00:28:38.317
Yeah.

00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:38.817
Yeah.

00:28:38.897 --> 00:28:41.478
I think it's probably because, like, we share, like, the same worries.

00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:41.858
Yeah.

00:28:41.918 --> 00:28:44.239
Or when we feel a bit off, we generally both feel off.

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:44.740
Yeah.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:50.922
So during those times, we try to talk to each other and then sort of figure out why we're not feeling quite right.

00:28:51.223 --> 00:28:51.563
Yeah.

00:28:51.723 --> 00:28:53.204
And then try to get sleep after that.

00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:54.864
And sometimes that helps.

00:28:54.884 --> 00:28:55.004
Yeah.

00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:57.788
Does that help?

00:28:58.028 --> 00:28:58.208
Yeah.

00:28:58.309 --> 00:29:01.014
The easiest thing to suggest though is the heating bags.

00:29:01.234 --> 00:29:01.434
Yeah.

00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:02.136
Always good.

00:29:02.256 --> 00:29:02.537
Yeah.

00:29:02.697 --> 00:29:02.997
Yeah.

00:29:03.699 --> 00:29:04.400
Even in summer.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.003
Yeah, even in summer.

00:29:06.023 --> 00:29:06.344
Yeah.

00:29:07.518 --> 00:29:09.839
Hopefully that can help you fall asleep more.

00:29:09.859 --> 00:29:11.959
Sleep is important to Ruffians.

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:13.020
And solid sleep.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.020
Good sleep, too.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.260
Uninterrupted.

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.881
Thank you, BAU BAU!

00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:24.983
We're also always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day, your walks, and of course, questions!

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.904
Please don't hesitate to submit yours with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:29:28.924 --> 00:29:29.724
We'll be waiting.

00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:30.305
BAU BAU!

00:29:35.326 --> 00:29:37.707
And let's take a look at our next stream.

00:29:38.307 --> 00:29:38.867
De-den!

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:40.788
It's time!

00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:45.730
We're gonna be playing Apex together with Bijou and Nerissa.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.391
We're gonna form a strong team.

00:29:48.631 --> 00:29:49.231
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:52.533
But, well, it's actually our first time playing all together.

00:29:52.613 --> 00:29:52.913
Yeah.

00:29:53.113 --> 00:29:56.974
So, I'm not really that sure what to expect from them.

00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:59.075
But it's me playing.

00:29:59.135 --> 00:29:59.495
Yeah.

00:29:59.575 --> 00:30:00.396
It's me playing.

00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:00.916
Not Moco-chan.

00:30:00.936 --> 00:30:01.796
Trust your Fuwawa.

00:30:01.856 --> 00:30:02.156
Yeah.

00:30:02.336 --> 00:30:03.537
Because I'm the strongest.

00:30:03.817 --> 00:30:04.017
Yeah.

00:30:04.437 --> 00:30:07.818
But yeah, Bijou and Nobisu, they've been pretty quiet about their skills.

00:30:08.338 --> 00:30:10.399
I kind of feel like it's a bit suspicious, you know?

00:30:10.419 --> 00:30:12.820
Like, you're gonna just completely carry them.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.621
Ah, I think that maybe they're like, Oh, well, Fuwawa, she's like, she's really good, right?

00:30:18.162 --> 00:30:24.063
But actually, maybe, I'll just kind of stay quiet and surprise her.

00:30:24.224 --> 00:30:24.724
I see.

00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:25.244
Yeah.

00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:27.064
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:30:27.084 --> 00:30:28.745
Do you think that they'll be better than me?

00:30:29.225 --> 00:30:30.726
I think... Hmm.

00:30:31.426 --> 00:30:31.626
Hmm.

00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:36.719
Maybe?

00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:37.742
No way.

00:30:38.122 --> 00:30:38.403
No way?

00:30:38.443 --> 00:30:39.024
No way.

00:30:39.144 --> 00:30:41.028
No way as in like, Fuwawa's the best?

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:42.331
That way.

00:30:43.314 --> 00:30:43.634
Yes!

00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:45.716
Yeah!

00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:47.357
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:53.321
But yeah, you'll have to be there to see just how strong Abyss is at Apex.

00:30:53.701 --> 00:30:54.922
Apex.

00:30:57.264 --> 00:30:58.485
And... Our schedule!

00:30:58.505 --> 00:31:03.208
We don't have much left of the schedule, but we still have lots of fun coming up.

00:31:03.608 --> 00:31:07.591
We're gonna be starting out on The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:10.553
Our first Zelda game together with you, Ruffians.

00:31:12.863 --> 00:31:14.384
I'm really excited, you know.

00:31:14.584 --> 00:31:19.427
But we're just a bit weird, because we're playing it on the N64, right?

00:31:20.508 --> 00:31:25.812
So we're going to keep our fingers crossed that the N64 and the game coaches want to cooperate with us.

00:31:25.892 --> 00:31:27.973
They've been through a lot.

00:31:27.993 --> 00:31:29.714
A lot, a lot, you know?

00:31:31.018 --> 00:31:32.778
There's been a lot of fun that they've given us.

00:31:33.178 --> 00:31:35.639
Given us, given Mama Puppy.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:38.599
And left on for hours and hours and hours.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.521
Without being turned off into the hot summer, you know.

00:31:45.801 --> 00:31:49.122
It's all in the original hardware, so let's hunt!

00:31:49.222 --> 00:31:49.962
It works out!

00:31:50.182 --> 00:31:51.922
Just blow on it, it'll be okay!

00:31:52.802 --> 00:31:55.083
That's what we'll do if it's problems.

00:31:57.139 --> 00:31:59.102
We're really looking forward to it!

00:31:59.603 --> 00:32:05.792
We also have more Donkey Kong Country, so let's hope that we can get to more of it.

00:32:05.852 --> 00:32:06.933
More than 8% this time.

00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:08.075
Let's hope.

00:32:08.435 --> 00:32:08.836
BAU BAU!

00:32:14.278 --> 00:32:18.961
You know, we're now at the end of another week of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:19.182 --> 00:32:20.643
It went so fast!

00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:22.564
But now, it's Friday.

00:32:22.764 --> 00:32:24.586
It's Friday, and I know there's a fun weekend.

00:32:24.946 --> 00:32:28.568
And next week there'll be even more FUWAMOCO Morning to come!

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:35.174
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:32:35.615 --> 00:32:36.215

00:32:54.472 --> 00:33:03.638
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:33:03.678 --> 00:33:06.700
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.061
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:09.401
