00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.600
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.287
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:14.009
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.610
BAU BAU!

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.551
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:23.272
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:27.454
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:31.855
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:33.416
Thank you for joining us

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:37.475
I can't believe it, Moco-chan.

00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:38.815
Start of a new week!

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:44.977
A brand new week together with the Ruffians.

00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:45.337
Wow, Ruffians!

00:05:45.397 --> 00:05:46.218
I'm sure you know.

00:05:56.328 --> 00:06:04.018
You kinda know what FUWAMOCO Morning is right now, but there could be a few new Ruffians joining us, so let us explain.

00:06:04.038 --> 00:06:10.407
A FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:14.441
Huh?

00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.742
I... I faceplanted.

00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.883
You did, you did.

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:21.944
I had so much to say.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:22.625
You did.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.506
And I really did a good job.

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:25.606
Wow, wow.

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:27.227
What was that, Moco-chan?

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:31.569
FUWAMOCO Morning is held on Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.971
Well anyways, it's hosted by us!

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.472
Moco-chan, can you answer?

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:39.092
Who's us?

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:41.073
Are we?

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:44.337
I think so!

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:46.937
We are the FUWAMOCO!

00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:53.680
And our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.120
Ruffians!

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.822
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:04.923
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:08.868
BAU BAU!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.350
We're off to a rather silly start, huh?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.513
You know, some mornings you just sort of faceplant.

00:07:15.094 --> 00:07:16.815
That's just how mornings go sometimes.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:18.657
You took the faceplant for the Ruffians, right?

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:19.058
I did!

00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:20.579
Now you're not gonna faceplant.

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:21.620
You can say thank you.

00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:23.122
You're welcome.

00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:25.404
Well, Ruffians!

00:07:26.605 --> 00:07:28.447
I'm sure you all kind of know, right?

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:41.251
Well, we wanted to say thank you for using your eyes, keeping them open, looking around for Pero, because you know, sometimes, you know, it's extra good to do that.

00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:45.332
Especially, you know, sometimes.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.953
Because we've had another Pero Sighting!

00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:49.653
Pero Sighting.

00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:55.074
You know, because sometimes, if you're not careful, if you don't keep your eyes open, bad things might happen.

00:07:56.554 --> 00:07:59.355
Just like this one Ruffian, I found Pero in there.

00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:00.981
Dessert.

00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:01.081
Pero.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:07.224
Pero, what are you doing in there, Pero?

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:09.365
You shouldn't be in there, hon.

00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:11.746
Maybe he's looking for pudding.

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:13.846
Pudding?

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:18.808
Well, I don't know if Pero's gonna find any pudding in there, but it does look really, really good!

00:08:18.828 --> 00:08:20.069
Yeah, it looks good, right?

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:25.591
The mangoes, and blueberries, and mochi, and mochi, and those popping bubbles!

00:08:29.256 --> 00:08:31.399
It looks really, really yummy.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:33.282
Is that soft serve under there too?

00:08:33.342 --> 00:08:34.323
It's ice cream!

00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:36.886
I want some!

00:08:37.027 --> 00:08:39.170
It's just the morning but I want dessert.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.491
Morning is good all the time.

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:42.694
Sharing is nice so keep it up!

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:46.977
Were you able to eat this afterwards though, you know?

00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:53.461
Pero, it can be pretty nasty, so I wouldn't be surprised if you made it kind of not taste that good.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:58.063
You know, ice cream is pretty, it's a pure vanilla taste.

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:00.704
Pero, I don't think Pero tastes like vanilla.

00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:02.985
Nasty, maybe garbage.

00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:06.267
But if Pero made it taste bad, then I'll eat the rest.

00:09:06.327 --> 00:09:07.187
It's okay.

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:07.727
Really?

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:08.528
Really?

00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:10.289
That's nice of you, Moco-chan.

00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:11.169
I'm always nice.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.650
You take the sacrifice?

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.192
I will sacrifice.

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:16.433
I will eat the ice cream.

00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:22.697
Well, hopefully, you know, it wasn't too bad.

00:09:23.637 --> 00:09:28.540
If it was, maybe the next time you have dessert, things will go a bit worse.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.881
Be careful when you're making it.

00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:32.563
Make sure Pero's not in there, okay?

00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:34.204
Food safety is important, right?

00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:34.964
Exactly.

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.105
BAU BAU!

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:40.886
Anyways, please let us know if you have any more sightings, Ruffians.

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:44.867
Especially, please make sure not to eat them by accident.

00:09:45.147 --> 00:09:48.308
When you're eating your food, make sure you do it in a well-lit area.

00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:49.008
Exactly.

00:09:49.508 --> 00:09:51.868
It's spooky otherwise.

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.349
Remember, please use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:57.930
BAU BAU!

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.930
Thank you!

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.451
And next, some Ruffians might have noticed, but...

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:06.667
Lifetime Showtime!

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:07.828
Ruffians!

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:16.010
Thank you so much for 100,000 views on our original intro song, Lifetime Showtime!

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.970
Thank you!

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.131
We really appreciate you listening to it lots and lots.

00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:23.232
It's, you know, it's special.

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:27.273
It's our own original intro song.

00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:28.213
You know what I mean?

00:10:28.413 --> 00:10:29.273
It's a lot.

00:10:29.653 --> 00:10:32.554
We hope that we can continue to make lots of original music.

00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:35.733
It's our special first, you know it!

00:10:36.354 --> 00:10:44.858
But creating original music for A.I.C.E is, as a lot of Ruffians probably know, it's a big goal, a big dream of ours within hololive, you know it!

00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:51.622
But you know, reality can be rough sometimes too, so we'll be counting on you to be passionate and

00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:54.043
Share all your love for it, okay?

00:10:54.123 --> 00:10:56.124
Okay, Ruffians!

00:10:56.525 --> 00:11:07.031
I know it might be a bit difficult at this point, but I think we'd really like to see it maybe hit 300k someday.

00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:07.971
300,000 views.

00:11:08.172 --> 00:11:13.735
It might be a bit... We'd be very happy though.

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:14.535
Someday though.

00:11:14.595 --> 00:11:15.496
Someday, right?

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:18.157
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:20.379
BAU BAU!

00:11:22.503 --> 00:11:26.204
And I think there was also some big news today, right?

00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:29.165
What's there?

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:31.485
De-den!

00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:34.806
What is this?

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.226
Can you believe it, Ruffians?

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:42.927
When we woke up this morning, suddenly, now, we're senpai!

00:11:42.987 --> 00:11:43.688
Right!

00:11:44.748 --> 00:11:52.769
It was announced that a new group, ReGLOSS, will be debuting from a new branch within hololive production called "hololive DEV_IS."

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.500
"Device," not "dev is."

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.769
DEV_IS!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.500
We also took a stab at what they might be kind of like on Twitter, you know, because we still don't know.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So we used the hashtag #リグしら(rigushira).

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:22.117
Headcanon thing that they're doing.

00:12:22.137 --> 00:12:25.500
I mean, kinda guessed, you know.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.026
We thought, you know, maybe that they're similar to Advent, you know, like full of personality.

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:32.668
Yeah, personality, right?

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.012
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:40.796
Nobody, yeah.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.435
Right, right!

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:46.736
Yeah, we're really excited, but we're also really nervous.

00:12:46.936 --> 00:12:50.477
Yeah, we didn't think that we'd be senpai this soon.

00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:53.618
To be honest, we still don't really know right from left.

00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:59.139
Yeah, we're still learning words and making mistakes every day too.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:00.599
Yeah!

00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:01.820
Plus, you know it!

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.961
We still haven't been able to collaborate one-on-one with our senpai either.

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:06.301
One-on-one?

00:13:06.321 --> 00:13:06.821
Two-on-one?

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:07.381
One-on-one!

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.221
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:13.603 --> 00:13:26.990
You know, it's kind of a funny feeling to think that there are already others who are calling us senpai, but... FUWAMOCO-senpai, Mococo-senpai, Fuwawa-senpai... I don't know.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.051
I don't know!

00:13:30.092 --> 00:13:31.813
BAU BAU!

00:13:31.893 --> 00:13:34.534
We'll be watching!

00:13:34.574 --> 00:13:34.794
Well...

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.880
Ruffians, it happened again.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.162
It might have just kind of happened again.

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:46.803
Just maybe.

00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:48.263
Just maybe.

00:13:48.303 --> 00:13:48.904
Just kinda.

00:13:49.064 --> 00:13:49.664
Kinda.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:54.987
There's been another misunderstanding.

00:13:55.107 --> 00:14:03.773
I was really hoping that we made it to two FUWAMOCO Mornings in a row, but... You know, our happy streak is broken.

00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:05.894
Fuwawa.

00:14:07.523 --> 00:14:10.497
She said something again that was misunderstood.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.593
You know, during It Takes Two, we were working together and stuff, right?

00:14:18.234 --> 00:14:22.196
And there was like a lot of different things that happened.

00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:35.505
And I might have mentioned that the only reason that I live with Moco-chan is because, you know, of real reasons that it's out of obligation.

00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:40.268
Because if I didn't live with Moco-chan, you know, I'd kind of be on the streets.

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:42.250
Moco-chan, you probably would be too, you know.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.836
I could've just maybe implied that Moco-chan's only good for paying her portion of the rent.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.900
Do you really think that's true?

00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:58.883
It is true though.

00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:02.485
But you know there are a lot of good things about living together with Moco-chan.

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:03.807
You like being with me.

00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:04.907
Right, Ruffians?

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.769
Good things about living with Moco-chan.

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:08.230
You like being with me, right?

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.031
Spending time together.

00:15:11.593 --> 00:15:11.793
Yeah.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.850
Yeah, I like.

00:15:14.171 --> 00:15:15.271
Yeah.

00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:19.333
But you know, living together, it's nice.

00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:21.014
It's nice too, you know?

00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:25.355
Like being able to use Moco-chan's cards, you know?

00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:28.877
Because Moco-chan, she gives me her cards because she doesn't want to hold them.

00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:34.079
And so then I can use her cards when I feel like I don't want to pay for something.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.981
And maybe I'll tell her afterwards.

00:15:38.911 --> 00:15:40.151
Sharing is important.

00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:41.631
Okay, Ruffians?

00:15:41.872 --> 00:15:43.112
But you'll be happy too.

00:15:43.132 --> 00:15:45.792
You'll be happy because then I'll share what I buy with you.

00:15:46.132 --> 00:15:46.552
You know?

00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:49.113
But sometimes, I don't want that.

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:50.733
Oh well.

00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:55.394
Thank you, Moco-chan!

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.174
Thank you!

00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:02.735
Is the misunderstanding cleared now?

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:02.915
Right.

00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:07.536
Ruffians, they understand what I meant.

00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:10.929
Okay.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.472
Yeah, living with Moco-chan is fun.

00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:15.533
There's lots of perks.

00:16:17.034 --> 00:16:18.575
I like living with Moco-chan.

00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:19.936
Do you, though?

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:22.137
Moco-chan, you like living with me too, right?

00:16:22.197 --> 00:16:27.241
Because I cook and I clean and I make stuff and I fetch stuff for you.

00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:29.122
I do that too, but yes.

00:16:30.103 --> 00:16:30.623
Sometimes.

00:16:30.964 --> 00:16:34.186
Ruffians!

00:16:34.966 --> 00:16:38.049
I actually have something to confess.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:55.915
It might be a little bit shocking, a little bit alarming, but... You know, during our Super Chat reading the other day, yesterday, there was actually something really weird that happened that we tried to hide from all the Ruffians.

00:16:57.896 --> 00:17:01.839
We're really, really sorry, Ruffians, for hiding this from you!

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:04.240
We didn't want to alarm you, you know?

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.601
We didn't want to scare you, so we tried our best!

00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:06.882
But...

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.441
Did you notice?

00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:14.769
Something was happening to the entire stream.

00:17:16.231 --> 00:17:20.557
There was something... SOMETHING in our room with us.

00:17:22.335 --> 00:17:31.398
You know, we never gave it permission to join us, but the entire time it kept on distracting us and even surprising us!

00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:40.221
Yeah, suddenly we'd just be like, uh, chit-chatting and then it would touch us and go close to our mouths and eyes.

00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:42.442
It was... it was...

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:45.293
A small fly!

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:46.813
It looked exactly like that!

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:47.734
Just like that!

00:17:47.774 --> 00:17:50.135
You know, with those big eyes and all the eyes.

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:52.716
If it was a cat, that would've been nice, but no.

00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:54.797
We were really surprised.

00:17:56.724 --> 00:18:00.347
You know, Fuwawa might have screamed a couple times, you know?

00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:04.349
Yeah, I think I accidentally screamed twice.

00:18:04.369 --> 00:18:06.431
Did you notice, Ruffians?

00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:09.313
It was not appreciated.

00:18:09.553 --> 00:18:11.995
I don't know why though.

00:18:12.035 --> 00:18:14.517
Why was there a fly in our room with us in the first place?

00:18:15.237 --> 00:18:18.159
We're really lucky because we never ever have bugs.

00:18:18.939 --> 00:18:20.260
It was that shocking, you know?

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.600
We never have bugs.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:25.162
Maybe it was when we had the window open?

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:28.084
Not appreciated.

00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:30.925
Were you worried, Ruffians?

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:34.767
Sorry, Ruffians.

00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:35.988
Sorry for worrying you.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.083
Stinky?

00:18:38.103 --> 00:18:39.243
Stinky?

00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:39.784
BAU BAU!

00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:41.845
It was a tiny one.

00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:43.786
That's why it was shocking.

00:18:44.046 --> 00:18:44.466
Why?

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:47.608
Because it's not big enough to see, but it's tiny.

00:18:47.908 --> 00:18:48.949
Tiny, you know?

00:18:48.969 --> 00:18:51.290
Just suddenly I was like, what is... What?

00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:52.851
Am I going crazy?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.061
That's why we scream.

00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:58.662
But it's gone now.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:18:59.783
It's gone now.

00:19:00.403 --> 00:19:01.224
Did you notice?

00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:01.844
Did you?

00:19:01.864 --> 00:19:01.904
Me?

00:19:03.445 --> 00:19:04.226
Moco-chan, not you.

00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:05.386
I didn't notice.

00:19:05.607 --> 00:19:06.367
The Ruffians.

00:19:07.308 --> 00:19:09.209
FUWAMOCO is a bit silly, you know?

00:19:10.189 --> 00:19:11.810
Screaming for no reason.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.991
I guess we do scream for no reason sometimes.

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:16.973
Maybe they already think we're silly, huh?

00:19:17.033 --> 00:19:17.574
Maybe.

00:19:19.975 --> 00:19:22.196
You have no idea!

00:19:22.336 --> 00:19:25.198
Okay, well, I'm glad we didn't alarm you then.

00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:27.739
BAU BAU!

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.540
I'm glad he's gone.

00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:30.321
Much better.

00:19:31.682 --> 00:19:35.484
We actually also had something that we kind of wanted to share with you.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.525
It's a bit of a new corner.

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:38.326
A new corner.

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:43.689
But we wanted to share something that we very much feel like

00:19:44.884 --> 00:19:46.106
We like recently.

00:19:47.548 --> 00:19:50.411
It's our new... We Dig It!

00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:51.232
We Dig It corner.

00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:52.274
Well, you know...

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:59.372
Everybody likes to relax at the end of the day, right?

00:19:59.812 --> 00:20:06.038
And you know, after a busy day, we like to relax, but we also like to better ourselves too, you know?

00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:11.803
So you know, naturally we think about how can we be better Demon Guard Dogs, you know?

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.105
What can we do to get stronger?

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:18.669
And you know, a strong BAU BAU is really really important.

00:20:18.829 --> 00:20:19.730
So, we've actually...

00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:29.158
We've been watching just regular dogs do their best BAU BAU!

00:20:29.858 --> 00:20:36.184
Watch them bark and howl so that we can get strong just like them!

00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:38.186
Maybe a bit more musical?

00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:46.368
I think our favorite kind of dog, dog, BAU BAU is the Huskies.

00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:48.949
You know, they're really popular with us right now.

00:20:48.989 --> 00:20:50.009
Right, Mococo?

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.130
Mococo.

00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:53.191
What?

00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:56.092
I called you Mococo and it felt weird.

00:20:58.253 --> 00:21:03.035
But you know, it'd be nice to be able to BAU BAU like a Husky, you know?

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:04.916
Ah, Moco-chan.

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:06.117
Wawa-chan.

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:07.861
What?

00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:10.926
BAU BAU like a husky?

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:12.048
BAU BAU!

00:21:15.157 --> 00:21:43.520
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:21:45.061 --> 00:21:46.181
Good BAU BAUs.

00:21:46.302 --> 00:21:51.964
Each dog has a different voice, so it's really fun to kind of hear how do they BAU BAU.

00:21:52.364 --> 00:21:52.584
Right?

00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:55.525
Accurate impression!

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:55.965
Thank you!

00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:56.785
Thank you!

00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:59.406
All the studying is paying off, Moco-chan!

00:22:03.528 --> 00:22:04.288
Thank you!

00:22:04.468 --> 00:22:05.708
BAU BAU!

00:22:05.728 --> 00:22:06.229
Next!

00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:08.369
BAU BAU!

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:13.031
On the topic of music.

00:22:14.071 --> 00:22:17.452
We have something that everyone's really looking forward to.

00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:20.854
Our FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:21.654
BAU BAU!

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:24.095
Yes!

00:22:24.716 --> 00:22:26.137
The day has come!

00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:37.587
But I want to let Ruffians that maybe weren't here for the past week know for the past week, we've been asking Ruffians for a special jingle for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:37.827 --> 00:22:42.711
So we've been asking on Twitter for you to submit your own FUWAMOCO Morning jingles.

00:22:42.771 --> 00:22:44.032
Give your best shot!

00:22:44.092 --> 00:22:44.893
Your best... No!

00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:47.335
Best... Best submission!

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:55.626
I mentioned it's only been about one week since we started asking for your jingles from you.

00:22:57.987 --> 00:23:01.829
We were really surprised because you came up with so many great ones!

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:02.809
Thank you!

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:05.170
Super unique, super creative.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.751
Really impressed.

00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:11.312
We hope you enjoyed the process, you know, the creative process a lot.

00:23:11.393 --> 00:23:16.074
And that hopefully, maybe you'll continue creating music from here on out too.

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:22.337
I'm really happy because I think there was a lot of Ruffians making their first attempt at music.

00:23:22.437 --> 00:23:24.278
You know, their first jingles.

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:26.199
So we're really happy.

00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:28.869
Ah, well you know.

00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:36.652
I'll let you know something, but we will be selecting the jingle that will be used here on out FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:23:36.912 --> 00:23:38.013
This is Friday!

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:44.596
But before that, we thought it'd be nice to be able to showcase a few jingles with you today.

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:45.196
Yeah!

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:46.717
Let's listen to some of them, okay?

00:23:47.357 --> 00:23:47.997
Is that okay?

00:23:49.358 --> 00:23:50.619
Are you ready, Ruffians?

00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:52.660
You have to look like this, okay?

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.621
Get ready, put your headphones on.

00:23:55.681 --> 00:23:57.142
Blast the music.

00:23:57.382 --> 00:23:58.482
Listen closely.

00:23:58.662 --> 00:23:59.543
Move the body.

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:02.064
You know it's morning, it's time to get going, right?

00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:03.304
It's a jingle, right?

00:24:03.324 --> 00:24:08.006
So you only have a few seconds before the dancing stops.

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:14.569
This first one we have a jingle from Jeremy Robson.

00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:17.391
Moco-chan, can we take a listen?

00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:21.258
Let's see if we have it.

00:24:21.278 --> 00:24:25.064
I'll turn it off.

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.288
It's the perfect environment to listen now.

00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:29.611
Okay, let's hear it!

00:24:30.132 --> 00:24:32.355
This is from Jeremy Robinson!

00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:48.299
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:49.040
It's so nice!

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.660
Thank you!

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.661
Tell me about that.

00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:58.106
This one has the theme of a morning news jingle on a local TV network from 1985 to 1990.

00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:00.067
I like how specific.

00:25:00.107 --> 00:25:01.588
It's very important.

00:25:01.768 --> 00:25:05.251
But it definitely feels very strong.

00:25:05.651 --> 00:25:05.911
Strong.

00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:06.211
Strong.

00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:07.172
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:07.352 --> 00:25:08.093
Grandiose.

00:25:08.753 --> 00:25:09.974
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:10.554 --> 00:25:12.536
Like we are going to get the news to you.

00:25:12.576 --> 00:25:15.698
We do it very, very well.

00:25:15.898 --> 00:25:16.919
Give a smile to you.

00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:20.141
We are going to make you smile no matter what.

00:25:20.701 --> 00:25:22.703
What did you think Ruffians?

00:25:23.363 --> 00:25:25.425
Very orchestral, right?

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:28.787
Lots of personality, right?

00:25:28.807 --> 00:25:31.669
FUWAMOCO News!

00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:32.129
Let's go!

00:25:34.651 --> 00:25:35.291
I don't know.

00:25:35.312 --> 00:25:38.113
I don't know if we have the skills for that.

00:25:38.213 --> 00:25:38.853
Why?

00:25:38.894 --> 00:25:39.254
Why?

00:25:39.834 --> 00:25:40.775
Very important.

00:25:40.975 --> 00:25:46.238
Thank you so much, Yumi, for the wonderful jingle!

00:25:46.838 --> 00:25:50.720
Well, next, we have a jingle from...

00:25:53.442 --> 00:25:55.364
Lily-chan!

00:25:55.404 --> 00:25:58.186
Let's take a listen!

00:25:58.226 --> 00:26:07.355
Lily-chan also worked on ano hi no bokura e for our hololive's Blue Journey, so we're really happy to see some Ruffians and a fan of FUWAMOCO Morning too!

00:26:07.395 --> 00:26:08.236
Let's take a listen!

00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:08.856
I wanna listen!

00:26:21.123 --> 00:26:25.487
The guitar has this welcoming, very personable feel.

00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:29.891
Reminds me of drinking a good cappuccino in the morning.

00:26:30.152 --> 00:26:31.073
Very warm.

00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:45.343
It's been good, you know, because the summer's over now and we're going to fall in winter.

00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:49.604
It's getting a bit colder, so we need to warm up, you know?

00:26:49.624 --> 00:26:51.204
Exactly!

00:26:51.704 --> 00:26:55.045
Thank you, Dimension!

00:26:55.646 --> 00:27:00.127
And for our next single, we have one from

00:27:01.435 --> 00:27:02.236
Ka-na-bun.

00:27:02.797 --> 00:27:04.159
Ka-na-bun!

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.261
BAU BAU!

00:27:06.922 --> 00:27:08.223
Let's take a listen.

00:27:08.303 --> 00:27:08.484
Okay.

00:27:08.504 --> 00:27:08.924
FUWAMOCO

00:27:21.176 --> 00:27:23.777
Ruffians, did you hear that last part?

00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:25.217
Oh my gosh.

00:27:25.297 --> 00:27:27.958
Beatboxing, right?

00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:29.579
So cool.

00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:33.080
You know, did you hear at the end there was the BAU BAU now?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.421
FUWAMOCO Morning, BAU BAU now.

00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:38.062
Moco-chan, do your best to beatbox like that.

00:27:38.082 --> 00:27:39.663
Are you serious?

00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:46.596
It sounds better than mine.

00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:48.720
I guess you have to be taller than Moco-chan.

00:27:49.522 --> 00:27:50.564
Ouch.

00:27:52.467 --> 00:27:52.788
Ouch.

00:27:52.968 --> 00:27:54.290
I like the BAU BAU now.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.871
Right?

00:27:54.912 --> 00:27:55.232
Right?

00:27:57.107 --> 00:27:59.649
You know, I was thinking though.

00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:06.233
For some reason, I feel like YouTube and beatboxing has a close connection.

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:07.073
A strong tie.

00:28:07.093 --> 00:28:14.438
Right, you know, I feel like a jingle like this with the beatboxing might make the YouTube algorithm really like FUWAMOCO's channel.

00:28:14.498 --> 00:28:14.998
Happy.

00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:17.480
BAU BAU now!

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.042
Thank you, Kanna-bun!

00:28:21.082 --> 00:28:22.663
BAU BAU!

00:28:24.107 --> 00:28:25.589
And what do we have next?

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:32.659
For our last jingle to showcase today, this one's from WONDERWORLD!

00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:33.460
Let's listen!

00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:35.242
Okay, here we go!

00:28:50.714 --> 00:28:51.955
Explosive!

00:28:52.295 --> 00:28:56.139
That was... Wow.

00:28:57.961 --> 00:28:59.543
Abyssgard, right?

00:29:00.204 --> 00:29:04.989
It's a very violent start to FUWAMOCO Morning, you know?

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.412
Pero Morning!

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:08.973
One day we'll use...

00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:11.938
I think you're better when you made this.

00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:14.042
I think I should say you're thinking of me.

00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:17.488
I love it though!

00:29:17.528 --> 00:29:18.309
It's so great!

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.715
Moco-chan, don't you kind of want to make lyrics to sing along with it?

00:29:21.755 --> 00:29:22.316
You know, like...

00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:28.155
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:53.092 --> 00:29:54.193
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:56.154
Thank you!

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:59.396
We hope you enjoyed these few that we showcased with you today.

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:04.420
Yeah, we really, really appreciate all the thought and love and care.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.081
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:09.603
Please look forward to the big reveal on Friday!

00:30:09.623 --> 00:30:11.905
BAU BAU!

00:30:12.785 --> 00:30:16.068
And next, we'll go to our regular corners.

00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:18.269
Doggie of the Day!

00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:21.051
Who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:21.852
We have...

00:30:23.751 --> 00:30:23.891
Oh!

00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:24.932
Moana!

00:30:24.952 --> 00:30:25.372
Moana!

00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:27.513
She's the Doggie of the Day.

00:30:27.854 --> 00:30:36.340
She's not the fluffiest or the fuzziest, but apparently, you know, that's okay because she gives the warmest hugs.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:45.866
But I was thinking, you know, I was gonna say, you know, she's not the fluffiest, she's not the fuzziest, but isn't she the most fashionable?

00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:47.527
Whatever you want me.

00:30:48.508 --> 00:30:49.970
I think we sort of look similar.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.811
No, you're the fuzzy one.

00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:51.491
Same fashion sense.

00:30:51.732 --> 00:30:52.853
You're the fuzzy one.

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:54.515
She's the fashionable one.

00:30:54.975 --> 00:30:55.236
Yeah.

00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:59.440
Look at the pink dress and the smile.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.242
The beautiful smile.

00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:02.684
It's a very good smile.

00:31:02.704 --> 00:31:05.286
But I think I like the cute tutu the best.

00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:05.887
Right?

00:31:06.127 --> 00:31:09.931
You know, the tutu is perfect because it lets her tail wag free.

00:31:10.972 --> 00:31:16.916
I kinda have a feeling that it's doing a lot of wagging to it today.

00:31:17.576 --> 00:31:19.817
She's obviously in love, right?

00:31:19.917 --> 00:31:20.478
I can tell.

00:31:20.498 --> 00:31:21.718
The look in the eyes.

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:22.699
Right?

00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:26.681
Well, how does Moana BAU BAU?

00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:29.743
I think she's very ladylike, you know?

00:31:29.783 --> 00:31:31.103
Ladylike, you know?

00:31:31.143 --> 00:31:32.164
Polite BAU BAU.

00:31:32.204 --> 00:31:33.084
I like BAU BAU.

00:31:33.145 --> 00:31:37.227
Not like the husky BAU BAU.

00:31:37.607 --> 00:31:38.548
Not like that, no.

00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:39.148
BAU BAU.

00:31:40.094 --> 00:31:40.556
BAU BAU!

00:31:40.596 --> 00:31:41.439
Very nice.

00:31:44.498 --> 00:31:49.081
Ah, but you know, like you said, she may not be the fluffiest or the fuzziest.

00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:49.761
Did I say that?

00:31:50.121 --> 00:31:50.742
Ah, ah.

00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:53.123
No, wolf mellows deru.

00:31:53.543 --> 00:31:54.504
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

00:31:54.884 --> 00:31:58.726
But you know, I'm sure she's great in many, many other ways.

00:31:58.986 --> 00:32:01.208
You know, like, like the smile there, right?

00:32:01.268 --> 00:32:02.568
And the lovely gaze.

00:32:02.648 --> 00:32:02.889
Yeah.

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:05.710
Not everything is about the fluff or the fuzz.

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.051
No, it's not.

00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:08.312
It's not, you know?

00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:09.352
That's okay.

00:32:09.632 --> 00:32:13.915
But you know, you can tell that she really never, ever wants to leave your side.

00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:17.049
She loves you.

00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:17.610
BAU BAU!

00:32:21.747 --> 00:32:26.550
And next we have... Today I went on a walk!

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.030
Corner.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.911
Where did we go today?

00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:32.913
It's so pretty!

00:32:33.213 --> 00:32:34.854
It's a market.

00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:37.495
It's sunrise!

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:42.038
From Asaichi, a morning market in Japan.

00:32:42.098 --> 00:32:43.899
Looks like they have ramen.

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:46.660
Other yummies can only get there too.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.061
It's a morning dream.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.083
Ramen nice and early in the morning when it's still a little bit cold out.

00:32:55.424 --> 00:32:57.605
You can enjoy it with the view!

00:32:57.685 --> 00:32:58.006
Right!

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.701
We've never ever been to something like this before.

00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:06.482
It's too bad there's nothing like this in the Northwest Pacific.

00:33:06.622 --> 00:33:07.702
Ruffians, where'd you go?

00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:10.763
First thing in the morning, wake up bright and early.

00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:12.743
Asaichi.

00:33:13.604 --> 00:33:16.224
And then after, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:33:16.464 --> 00:33:18.925
Oh, you go to Asaichi.

00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:24.807
Maybe you have your ramen while watching the sunrise and then listening to FUWAMOCO Morning on your phone.

00:33:24.827 --> 00:33:24.967
Right?

00:33:27.597 --> 00:33:28.377
It sounds nice.

00:33:28.897 --> 00:33:32.119
Oh, this morning mic is with you, too!

00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:34.759
I'm not envious.

00:33:34.899 --> 00:33:36.280
It would be fun, right?

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.921
And then you could go on a really wonderful morning walk, too!

00:33:41.022 --> 00:33:41.982
Nobody's around.

00:33:42.002 --> 00:33:42.162
Nice.

00:33:42.622 --> 00:33:43.142
BAU BAU!

00:33:43.742 --> 00:33:47.644
Thank you for sharing!

00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:49.945
Arigatone, BAU BAU!

00:33:50.785 --> 00:33:53.946
And next for our Question of the Day,

00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:55.706
What kind of question do we have?

00:33:55.847 --> 00:34:01.609
We have... I have a boat to pick with you two.

00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:03.229
What's wrong?

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:07.150
I have a very serious job with very serious people.

00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:10.211
We have an acronym that we use all the time.

00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:10.932
BAU!

00:34:13.052 --> 00:34:14.133
Business as usual.

00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:15.373
No, BAU is BAU.

00:34:15.413 --> 00:34:17.194
BAU is not business as usual.

00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:24.576
How do I protect and hide my smile in these serious meetings when my colleagues start talking about BAU?

00:34:25.576 --> 00:34:28.337
I think maybe the answer is a bit more simple.

00:34:31.118 --> 00:34:31.498
Is it?

00:34:31.518 --> 00:34:32.578
I don't know.

00:34:32.598 --> 00:34:34.239
I think you know.

00:34:36.263 --> 00:34:41.169
If your coworker, if they ask you, BAU, then you go BAU BAU.

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:42.310
BAU BAU, right.

00:34:42.971 --> 00:34:43.271
Right.

00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:44.893
Are they just being silly?

00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:47.235
What are humans up to now?

00:34:47.255 --> 00:34:50.659
The answer is always BAU BAU.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.723
If your coworker asks you BAU, then you say BAU BAU.

00:34:53.743 --> 00:34:54.243
BAU BAU!

00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:54.904
Right.

00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:56.865
It's good, right?

00:34:57.285 --> 00:34:57.826
BAU BAU.

00:34:58.006 --> 00:34:59.066
Yeah, just like that.

00:34:59.146 --> 00:35:00.326
Just like that.

00:35:00.406 --> 00:35:01.367
Exactly.

00:35:01.727 --> 00:35:06.928
Maybe you should make sure to sign all the important documents with a paw print, too.

00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:12.190
That way you know for sure that you mean business.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.211
Huh?

00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:17.972
Which one is it?

00:35:18.192 --> 00:35:19.112
Business or BAU?

00:35:19.212 --> 00:35:21.853
If you sign with a paw print, then you mean business.

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.235
Or you mean BA!

00:35:25.895 --> 00:35:26.255
The same.

00:35:26.315 --> 00:35:32.537
But Moco-chan, whenever we sign with our paw prints, you don't... I'm in business.

00:35:32.977 --> 00:35:33.937
Very serious.

00:35:34.437 --> 00:35:34.838
Ahoy.

00:35:36.138 --> 00:35:37.198
You misunderstand.

00:35:37.298 --> 00:35:38.639
It should be BAU.

00:35:39.299 --> 00:35:41.460
Maybe you're the one who's misunderstanding, hoy.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:42.560
Ahoy.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.061
Did we answer the question at all?

00:35:45.321 --> 00:35:45.601
Yes.

00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:49.342
Okay, well, at least you know this Ruffian will now know

00:35:50.907 --> 00:35:53.410
How to answer those poems properly though, right?

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:54.090
Exactly.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.411
You ask BAU.

00:35:55.752 --> 00:35:56.432
BAU BAU.

00:35:56.632 --> 00:35:56.872
Yeah.

00:35:57.073 --> 00:35:57.733
BAU BAU.

00:35:57.753 --> 00:35:59.234
BAU BAU is always the answer.

00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:01.076
Thank you!

00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:02.978
BAU BAU!

00:36:03.338 --> 00:36:04.179
And Ruffians!

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:06.320
Listen, listen, listen, okay?

00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:12.686
We want you to know we're always looking for more submissions for, you know, our Pero Sightings we had at the beginning, right?

00:36:13.615 --> 00:36:19.036
And then we had a Doggie of the Day, and we had your walks, and then of course the question here.

00:36:20.216 --> 00:36:25.017
Recently, there's been a little bit less submissions than usual.

00:36:25.037 --> 00:36:28.778
Moco-chan, you were a little bit grumpy about it.

00:36:28.838 --> 00:36:30.038
I didn't get grumpy.

00:36:30.098 --> 00:36:32.618
I just thought maybe the Ruffians were forgetting, you know.

00:36:32.898 --> 00:36:35.819
But you know, because of that, your chance!

00:36:36.219 --> 00:36:37.999
It's now, Ruffians!

00:36:38.219 --> 00:36:40.480
Please share with us a little bit of your world.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.881
Don't hesitate!

00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:44.161
We want to know it!

00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:44.682
Use the hashtag!

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.102
FWMCMORNING!

00:36:45.142 --> 00:36:46.183
That's the hashtag!

00:36:46.463 --> 00:36:46.883
Thank you!

00:36:47.043 --> 00:36:47.804
BAU BAU!

00:37:01.112 --> 00:37:10.981
For our next stream, we're going to be playing the Adventures of Cookie and Cream.

00:37:11.702 --> 00:37:12.963
Don't get confused, okay?

00:37:12.983 --> 00:37:19.729
Because unfortunately we won't be having an evening stream tonight because we're going to be working on some homework.

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:21.431
So this is going to be tomorrow.

00:37:21.471 --> 00:37:22.672
Tomorrow evening.

00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:29.160
But yes, we're going to be firing up our PS2 for FromSoftware.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.262
This time we're playing Adventure of Cookie and Cream.

00:37:32.443 --> 00:37:33.183
You couldn't tell.

00:37:34.024 --> 00:37:35.445
But it's a classic co-op game.

00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:39.688
It's very colorful and a bit tricky.

00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:42.570
I think Ruffians, if you enjoy it, it takes two.

00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:46.074
You'll really enjoy this one too.

00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:47.836
Teamwork, you know?

00:37:47.896 --> 00:37:53.563
Please join us as we go on our adventure as two cute, funny FUWAMOCOs!

00:37:53.623 --> 00:37:54.604
Thank you!

00:37:55.225 --> 00:37:57.507
And our schedule!

00:37:57.768 --> 00:38:00.751
We have a brand new schedule for a brand new week!

00:38:02.353 --> 00:38:11.842
You know, not only are we just making our Minecraft debut with Advent, but we'll also be holding a very important Japanese Classroom with all of Advent 2!

00:38:11.902 --> 00:38:13.443
We're gonna be becoming

00:38:18.968 --> 00:38:20.269
The sensei for Advent.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:28.115
But you know, we were sort of thinking that as Advent members, we might be able to collab with our JP-senpai, right?

00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:29.136
Right, you know?

00:38:29.156 --> 00:38:34.280
We wanted to make sure that Advent is ready to go and can communicate a lot.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.743
You know that the Nihongo is okay.

00:38:37.863 --> 00:38:38.404
Exactly.

00:38:38.424 --> 00:38:39.885
It's daijoubu, right?

00:38:39.905 --> 00:38:40.265
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:41.106
It's daijoubu.

00:38:41.246 --> 00:38:42.967
So we're gonna do our best to become

00:38:43.948 --> 00:38:44.769
The Sensei!

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:47.193
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Sensei!

00:38:47.213 --> 00:38:49.016
From Senpai to Sensei!

00:38:50.267 --> 00:38:51.247
Wow, level up.

00:38:51.347 --> 00:38:52.148
Alright.

00:38:52.208 --> 00:39:00.491
You know, we're gonna do our best to teach as much as we can about the Japanese language, and try not to teach them maybe too many weird things too.

00:39:01.192 --> 00:39:02.192
Let's do our best.

00:39:02.752 --> 00:39:04.713
BAU BAU!

00:39:04.753 --> 00:39:05.814
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:39:05.874 --> 00:39:10.656
Thank you for joining us for another FUWAMOCO Morning today!

00:39:11.536 --> 00:39:17.719
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!
