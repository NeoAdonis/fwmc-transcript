## ‚öíÔ∏è Building

Some of the files here are generated automatically.

1. Media is extracted directly from YouTube along with its metadata. Audio is converted into .wav format for easier processing.
1. Audio is automatically transcribed using a mix of automatic speech recognition plus some manual workarounds to provide the most accurate transcript possible from the get-go.
1. A basic summary is created. A LLM/RAG tool can be leveraged to to summarize the information from the transcript and help with the initial draft.
1. Using the basic summary and metadata from each media, a fancier summary document can be created programatically.
1. An index of all summaries can be automatically generated.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/)
- [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- Optional: [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)

If using Windows, you can install all these prerequisites with [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/).

## üî∞ Quick start

### Install prerequisites in Windows

[Make sure that WinGet is installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/), then run the following:

```text
winget install Oven-sh.Bun
winget install Anaconda.Miniconda3 -v py310_23.5.2-0
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp
winget install Nvidia.CUDA -v 11.8
```

### Set up Miniconda environment

1. If using PowerShell, init Miniconda: `conda init powershell`
1. Create environment: `conda create --name whisperx`
1. Activate environment: `conda activate whisperx`
1. Install requirements: `conda install pytorch==2.1.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
1. Install WhisperX: `pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git`

The latest supported PyTorch version in whisperX (as of version 3.1.1) is 2.1.2, which also restricts the Python version that can be installed in your Miniconda environment to 3.10. To use a newer PyTorch version, you can update `pyannote.audio`; for instance, upgrading to version 3.3.1 enables installation of PyTorch 2.3.1 and usage of Python 3.12.
