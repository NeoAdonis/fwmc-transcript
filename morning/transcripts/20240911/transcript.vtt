05:09.105 --> 05:10.966
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:10.986 --> 05:13.668
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.328 --> 05:24.270
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.670 --> 05:27.112
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.312 --> 05:29.073
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.113 --> 05:31.614
BAU BAU BAU!

05:32.135 --> 05:35.897
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:35.937 --> 05:36.658
BAU BAU!

05:37.518 --> 05:38.278
Ruffians!

05:38.779 --> 05:39.419
Are you awake?

05:39.679 --> 05:41.460
No more 5 more minutes, I saw it!

05:41.741 --> 05:44.262
You could've confused Moco-chan!

05:44.282 --> 05:47.704
No more 5 more minutes, we're starting now!

05:49.628 --> 05:51.009
But thank you!

05:51.029 --> 06:00.272
Despite no more 5 minutes, thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 125th episode!

06:00.372 --> 06:02.852
BAU BAU!

06:03.173 --> 06:06.594
No more 5 minutes, but we'll take that 5 and we'll put it in the 125th.

06:06.674 --> 06:08.214
Is that how it works?

06:08.234 --> 06:09.315
That's how it works.

06:11.149 --> 06:12.670
Okay, well, I guess.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.470
BAU BAU!

06:15.651 --> 06:20.392
Well, for those just waking up, and those maybe joining us for the first time!

06:20.412 --> 06:21.412
You're always welcome!

06:21.953 --> 06:27.435
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:27.695 --> 06:28.255
A.K.A.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.215
FUWAMOCO!

06:29.275 --> 06:32.236
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:32.436 --> 06:37.198
Remember, Ruffians, if you remember the days of the week, FUWAMOCO Morning's on you better than Shiori.

06:37.998 --> 06:38.318
What?

06:38.338 --> 06:43.921
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:44.221 --> 06:50.304
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:50.504 --> 06:53.566
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:53.606 --> 06:54.186
BAU BAU!

06:58.148 --> 07:00.509
Ruffians, you understand what I mean, right?

07:00.549 --> 07:03.110
Moco-chan, you understand what I mean, right?

07:03.130 --> 07:04.290
I-I guess.

07:04.350 --> 07:07.992
Cause Shiori didn't know until we got to the 100th episode.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.693
It's like, oh!

07:09.853 --> 07:11.633
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

07:12.054 --> 07:12.854
FUWAMOCO.

07:12.894 --> 07:16.695
It's not the C. We did the Christmas FUWAMOCO already.

07:16.735 --> 07:20.297
No, Ruffians don't understand, no.

07:20.337 --> 07:20.497
What?

07:20.557 --> 07:20.837
FWM.

07:21.297 --> 07:22.878
Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

07:23.278 --> 07:24.338
FUWAMO.

07:24.959 --> 07:25.159
Christmas.

07:27.799 --> 07:28.619
Merry Christmas.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.119
BAU BAU!

07:30.420 --> 07:32.980
If you do that, you're better than Shiori, right?

07:33.460 --> 07:35.040
I guess.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.721
BAU BAU!

07:38.441 --> 07:40.841
Let's bring this morning to sunrise.

07:40.861 --> 07:45.462
With some bad news!

07:46.122 --> 07:47.243
Bad news.

07:48.243 --> 07:50.923
There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:50.943 --> 07:52.303
Pero Sighting.

07:53.104 --> 07:55.004
Let's take a look where he is again.

07:56.529 --> 07:57.729
Rip off the band-aid.

07:57.849 --> 07:59.770
Is he at another warehouse or something?

07:59.790 --> 08:01.630
That's what you wanna do first thing in the morning.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.010
Rip off the band-aid.

08:03.610 --> 08:05.431
Let's see what he looks like.

08:05.671 --> 08:07.411
De-den!

08:07.571 --> 08:10.992
Birthday lunch!

08:11.052 --> 08:11.932
With friends!

08:12.172 --> 08:12.952
Yeah!

08:13.552 --> 08:17.453
But he's sort of in a band-aid shape, but... Nevermind.

08:18.693 --> 08:21.113
A nasty surprise on your birthday.

08:21.813 --> 08:24.134
His eyes... They're so shiny!

08:24.194 --> 08:25.114
Kinda shiny.

08:26.031 --> 08:29.976
Yeah, the omelette kind of even looks... Fluffy!

08:30.597 --> 08:31.398
Hot!

08:32.078 --> 08:33.240
Salad looks pretty fresh.

08:33.280 --> 08:33.921
Not fuzzy.

08:34.221 --> 08:35.182
Yeah, not fuzzy.

08:35.242 --> 08:36.043
Not a fuzzy salad.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.745
You don't want a fuzzy salad!

08:37.765 --> 08:41.470
Yeah, I bet you know it's all delicious.

08:41.890 --> 08:42.691
But, uh...

08:43.872 --> 08:50.076
Maybe, you know, just this time, you kind of have to help out by cleaning up this trash.

08:50.156 --> 08:50.877
Yeah!

08:50.937 --> 08:53.338
Sticking a knife right into the middle.

08:53.418 --> 08:54.639
Clean it all up.

08:54.979 --> 08:55.639
Yeah.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.182
You know, cleaning up the trash on your birthday.

08:59.242 --> 09:00.863
Is that okay, Moco-chan?

09:01.103 --> 09:02.644
It's a nice thing to do, I guess.

09:02.904 --> 09:03.564
Right.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.186
It's my birthday, but I'll take out the trash.

09:06.326 --> 09:07.066
Right.

09:07.246 --> 09:07.667
Wow.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.648
Yeah, very nice thing.

09:10.242 --> 09:11.283
Yeah, thank you!

09:11.603 --> 09:18.630
Thank you for making the world a better place by cleaning up this trash, getting rid of the nastiness.

09:19.011 --> 09:22.174
Yeah, cleaning up the nastiness, huh?

09:22.194 --> 09:22.834
Yeah, right?

09:22.855 --> 09:23.195
Very good.

09:23.235 --> 09:24.096
That's so good though.

09:24.556 --> 09:26.338
No, it's just horrible trash.

09:26.798 --> 09:27.399
Nasty.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.500
But we'll eat it.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.241
It's probably delicious.

09:30.118 --> 09:31.879
BAU BAU!

09:31.899 --> 09:33.740
I hope you had a good birthday despite it all!

09:34.152 --> 09:40.204
Happy birthday!

09:40.264 --> 09:41.587
BAU BAU!

09:41.627 --> 09:42.328
BAU BAU!

09:43.049 --> 09:49.062
Well, chat's just said... Ruffians! Something really big just happened!

09:49.402 --> 09:52.188
In hololive English history!

09:52.348 --> 09:53.130
That big!

09:53.150 --> 09:53.971
That big!

09:54.052 --> 09:55.555
Do you know what it is, Ruffians?

09:57.173 --> 09:59.315
hololive English history we're talking!

09:59.335 --> 10:00.416
Breaking Dimensions, yes, but... But!

10:06.898 --> 10:13.229
Well... Our shark senpai from hololive English -Myth-, Gura-senpai!

10:13.249 --> 10:15.753
Gura-senpai just revealed her 2.0!

10:19.633 --> 10:20.353
Did you see?

10:20.373 --> 10:20.734
Look!

10:21.034 --> 10:22.115
Look at it here!

10:22.155 --> 10:24.636
Look how cute Gura-senpai is!

10:24.877 --> 10:27.839
It's absolutely amazing!

10:27.859 --> 10:28.279
Amazing!

10:28.399 --> 10:28.740
Right?

10:28.780 --> 10:29.360
Snazzy!

10:29.420 --> 10:29.740
Yeah!

10:29.760 --> 10:30.341
Snazzy!

10:30.501 --> 10:35.104
You know, it's like Gura-senpai after a really really nice spa treatment.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.565
It's a spa treatment!

10:36.605 --> 10:36.766
Yeah!

10:36.926 --> 10:38.447
Spa treatment for a sock!

10:39.227 --> 10:40.649
Sharks need a spa day.

10:40.869 --> 10:41.410
Why not?

10:41.610 --> 10:42.391
Some bubbles.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.273
Extra bubbles.

10:44.573 --> 10:46.295
Maybe like a sand bath.

10:46.976 --> 10:48.898
I like sand paper.

10:48.918 --> 10:50.279
Sharks take sand baths.

10:51.541 --> 10:53.583
That's kind of regular for them though.

10:53.603 --> 10:55.965
Mud bath.

10:56.045 --> 10:57.987
Mud bath sounds so regular maybe.

10:59.872 --> 11:00.613
Baby.

11:01.414 --> 11:03.598
I don't know.

11:04.839 --> 11:08.765
But you know now Gura-senpai she moves so fluidly.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.628
Looks so cute.

11:10.668 --> 11:13.151
Especially with that... The cat shark move.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.521
Yeah!

11:18.781 --> 11:19.582
Can you believe it?

11:19.642 --> 11:21.823
Kuro-senpai got even cuter!

11:21.943 --> 11:25.306
I didn't think it was possible, Ruffians!

11:25.766 --> 11:28.188
Mine's super fluid now!

11:28.788 --> 11:28.969
Yeah.

11:29.029 --> 11:29.869
Look at that face!

11:29.909 --> 11:31.450
Yeah, just like that!

11:31.510 --> 11:34.152
But my teeth are still there!

11:34.212 --> 11:34.493
Yeah!

11:34.533 --> 11:36.634
Didn't take away her teeth.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.255
No.

11:37.335 --> 11:37.795
I know.

11:38.075 --> 11:38.996
She's a shark, you know.

11:39.336 --> 11:41.097
She needs her teeth, you know?

11:41.497 --> 11:46.419
We're just so happy that Gura-senpai got a bit of a makeover, you know?

11:46.779 --> 11:50.661
You know, she just must be so elated too!

11:50.741 --> 11:54.202
Congratulations, Gura-senpai!

11:54.602 --> 11:56.243
Yeah, no one can take the fangs.

11:56.263 --> 11:57.383
No, no, no, no.

11:57.443 --> 11:58.604
No bottom teeth though.

11:58.624 --> 12:06.187
You have to take all the bottom teeth and still really, really do some damage, huh?

12:08.487 --> 12:10.968
Cute is the priority, right?

12:11.028 --> 12:12.269
Extreme violence later.

12:12.309 --> 12:13.270
That's our motto.

12:13.390 --> 12:20.554
I really hope that I can get to see Gura-senpai's cute face lots and lots!

12:20.634 --> 12:23.576
BAU BAU!

12:24.656 --> 12:25.797
BAU BAU!

12:26.357 --> 12:26.998
Baudotiti?

12:27.078 --> 12:27.318
No!

12:27.338 --> 12:30.760
Can't have too much of a good thing, right?

12:33.001 --> 12:34.762
Do we need... Moco-chan!

12:35.582 --> 12:36.503
Oh, are you sad?

12:37.846 --> 12:39.927
Would you like me more if I had teeth?

12:41.908 --> 12:44.489
Moco-chan, we're making this about you again!

12:44.509 --> 12:44.569
How?

12:46.370 --> 12:49.932
Look, I can eat so well.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.554
We have fangs, Ruffians!

12:54.594 --> 12:55.715
Look at my fangs!

12:55.735 --> 12:59.016
Watch out!

12:59.056 --> 13:00.077
Watch out!

13:00.097 --> 13:00.357
Yeah.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.379
They might just not be as sharp as a shark.

13:07.739 --> 13:09.921
But that's because we're demon dogs!

13:10.121 --> 13:12.242
It's sharp on my claws!

13:12.322 --> 13:12.722
Yeah.

13:13.142 --> 13:14.043
Watch out for the claws.

13:14.063 --> 13:16.024
But I will validate the tickets, okay?

13:16.084 --> 13:17.085
Yeah, we can do that.

13:17.425 --> 13:17.685
Yeah.

13:18.616 --> 13:20.742
BAU BAU!

13:20.762 --> 13:21.464
BAU BAU!

13:21.484 --> 13:24.974
There's also some really big news too!

13:25.235 --> 13:26.258
Incredible news!

13:26.418 --> 13:27.080
Yeah!

13:27.140 --> 13:30.630
You know, Advent, we just had our first anniversary!

13:30.731 --> 13:32.253
Which means...

13:32.753 --> 13:33.574
ReGLOSS!

13:34.014 --> 13:38.037
ReGLOSS is now celebrating their first anniversary too!

13:38.097 --> 13:39.337
BAU BAU!

13:40.518 --> 13:44.801
And of course the first anniversary comes with a bunch of cool things going on!

13:48.123 --> 13:52.467
Well, they just released their newest song, Feeling Gradation!

13:52.827 --> 13:55.149
And it has a fully animated MV!

13:55.749 --> 13:57.231
It's so amazing!

13:57.291 --> 13:58.532
They're dancing!

13:58.712 --> 14:00.453
Yeah, dancing, singing!

14:00.934 --> 14:05.938
All, you know, just like beautiful idols in animated glory!

14:06.098 --> 14:06.278
Yeah!

14:06.298 --> 14:07.399
You better go check it out!

14:07.439 --> 14:08.080
Yeah, look!

14:08.120 --> 14:09.861
Look at them all there!

14:10.041 --> 14:11.282
Ririka, Tami.

14:11.923 --> 14:13.104
Oh, Moco-chan.

14:15.543 --> 14:15.923
Excuse me.

14:16.003 --> 14:17.924
I've been thinking huh?

14:18.244 --> 14:20.944
That is looking kind of fluffy there.

14:23.565 --> 14:26.605
Hi!

14:27.826 --> 14:28.686
Hi!

14:29.886 --> 14:31.967
Then we got some great outfits!

14:32.667 --> 14:36.548
But not just a brand new song with an amazing MV.

14:36.608 --> 14:37.648
Not just that!

14:38.048 --> 14:38.508
But!

14:38.988 --> 14:39.748
We got!

14:40.128 --> 14:42.669
They'll be having their 3 day debut!

14:44.709 --> 14:48.810
It's gonna be on September 28th GST!

14:49.090 --> 14:52.410
Their first 3D online concert!

14:52.731 --> 14:53.671
Are you ready?

14:53.751 --> 14:54.751
Reach the top.

14:55.071 --> 14:56.271
Yeah, reach the top.

14:56.351 --> 14:58.151
So close and too short, Kai.

14:58.492 --> 14:58.832
What?

14:59.012 --> 14:59.772
Moco-chan!

14:59.832 --> 15:03.692
They can't reach the top because they're too short!

15:03.752 --> 15:05.513
We're 155 centimeters.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.153
I'm not seeing anything.

15:09.173 --> 15:12.854
I think we have to reach the top too.

15:17.979 --> 15:20.401
But we just can't wait, you know.

15:20.421 --> 15:25.265
3D debut means we get to see their singing, their dancing!

15:25.625 --> 15:27.367
I wonder what it'll be like, maybe.

15:29.368 --> 15:31.770
Well, we don't have to wait too long.

15:31.830 --> 15:37.855
Just in a few weeks, on the 28th, JST, we'll be able to see them on 3D!

15:38.475 --> 15:40.537
And, not just that.

15:40.677 --> 15:41.678
Not just that!

15:41.698 --> 15:43.199
There's been so many announcements!

15:44.020 --> 15:44.860
But there's more!

15:46.001 --> 15:51.724
Wow, Wigwoss will also be releasing an album filled with 8 songs!

15:51.744 --> 15:52.905
8 full songs!

15:52.945 --> 15:53.885
Full songs!

15:54.145 --> 15:55.486
Oh my gosh!

15:56.386 --> 16:01.669
Makes sense, you know Wigwoss being the idol group that they all write together.

16:01.729 --> 16:02.129
Right!

16:02.269 --> 16:03.070
No way!

16:03.210 --> 16:05.211
Writing 8 songs!

16:05.431 --> 16:06.852
A whole full album!

16:06.912 --> 16:07.312
Yeah!

16:09.627 --> 16:10.328
Let's go!

16:10.388 --> 16:10.888
Let's go!

16:11.068 --> 16:11.269
Yeah!

16:11.309 --> 16:13.391
We can't wait to hear what it sounds like!

16:13.991 --> 16:14.391
Right!

16:14.412 --> 16:18.455
Oh, what kind of ReGLOSS are they gonna show us with their new music?

16:18.776 --> 16:19.556
Glossier?

16:20.177 --> 16:20.938
Glossier?

16:21.118 --> 16:26.523
I don't... If they become glossier, they might just... Gloss into the universe.

16:27.304 --> 16:28.545
We need that to stay here.

16:28.565 --> 16:29.385
Yeah.

16:30.802 --> 16:32.183
BAU BAU!

16:49.021 --> 16:57.089
Ruffians, have you noticed something going on, you know, with FUWAMOCO here?

17:07.809 --> 17:13.292
You know, have you maybe smelled a certain scent from FUWAMOCO?

17:13.332 --> 17:13.452
What?

17:14.472 --> 17:16.153
Extreme violence!

17:16.273 --> 17:16.914
Yeah!

17:16.954 --> 17:19.855
The scent of extreme violence we have!

17:20.015 --> 17:25.878
Cause right now we have a special collab together with World of Tanks Blitz!

17:26.838 --> 17:27.059
Oh!

17:28.379 --> 17:30.562
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

17:43.859 --> 17:44.880
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.161
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

18:00.290 --> 18:04.254
But you know, FUWAMOCO will help you in the best areas possible.

18:04.294 --> 18:09.978
You know, things like, you know, getting our special collectible FUWAMOCO donut.

18:10.038 --> 18:12.760
You know, a donut is very important to a tank.

18:13.081 --> 18:13.561
It is!

18:13.681 --> 18:15.062
It's what tanks run on.

18:15.343 --> 18:18.185
You may think, oh they run on whatever tanks run on.

18:18.505 --> 18:20.206
But they run on donuts.

18:20.346 --> 18:22.607
Donuts are a very important part.

18:22.627 --> 18:25.048
There's other things too, you know.

18:25.088 --> 18:27.609
Special FUWAMOCO avatars.

18:27.749 --> 18:32.752
Also a snazzy FUWAMOCO skin that you can use just for your tag too.

18:32.972 --> 18:34.273
I'm a fuzz.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.434
So yeah, please go check it out, okay?

18:37.474 --> 18:40.896
We're together with our senpai and our biboo too.

18:40.916 --> 18:43.157
If you ever want to miss it, it will end.

18:43.877 --> 18:47.159
February 27th is on right now, so check it out!

18:47.300 --> 18:48.060
Go check it out!

18:48.100 --> 18:52.263
You can finally get the FUWAMOCO Iida tank of your dreams too!

18:52.283 --> 18:53.824
You've all been waiting for it, right?

18:54.144 --> 18:54.565
Right.

18:54.725 --> 18:56.746
You want... That's always what you dreamed about.

18:56.766 --> 18:59.508
Forget the Iida car!

18:59.648 --> 19:03.051
Forget, you know, new original song, FUWAMOCO tank.

19:05.152 --> 19:09.435
FUWAMOCO, please go check out one of those tanks, please!

19:09.935 --> 19:12.837
Thanks, you're welcome!

19:12.877 --> 19:13.838
You're welcome!

19:13.878 --> 19:15.639
You don't have to thank me so much.

19:16.399 --> 19:17.480
You're welcome, okay?

19:18.201 --> 19:19.381
FUWAMOCO-chan!

19:19.441 --> 19:20.882
You get my joke?

19:22.003 --> 19:22.844
I finally do.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.781
You're welcome!

19:30.441 --> 19:32.922
BAU BAU!

19:32.942 --> 19:35.723
Oh, I like the title, World of Thanks Blitz.

19:36.263 --> 19:37.083
World of Thanks?

19:37.163 --> 19:39.844
Yeah, it's a positive world, you know.

19:40.644 --> 19:41.705
So much thanks.

19:42.245 --> 19:42.465
Wow.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.113
No, not World of Thanks.

19:45.573 --> 19:46.493
World of Thanks!

19:46.794 --> 19:47.894
World of Time Splits.

19:47.934 --> 19:50.856
BAU BAU!

19:51.316 --> 19:52.717
BAU BAU!

19:52.777 --> 19:55.098
What was that?

19:55.458 --> 20:01.042
I was just worried that maybe we continued this corner even before we got to it.

20:01.502 --> 20:10.407
That's what I was thinking too.

20:10.427 --> 20:10.727
Ruffians!

20:11.447 --> 20:12.068
There's been a...

20:13.140 --> 20:14.841
Misunderstanding.

20:14.861 --> 20:19.482
Hopefully nothing new other than... Yeah.

20:20.202 --> 20:24.984
It's been a while, but it's been a misunderstanding, Ruffians.

20:26.505 --> 20:27.085
Yuto!

20:27.545 --> 20:28.845
First of all!

20:29.286 --> 20:31.186
We had anorecho, right?

20:31.226 --> 20:31.426
Yeah!

20:31.446 --> 20:32.847
Anomatic recollection.

20:33.227 --> 20:34.847
Do you remember what that was?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.148
It was so long ago.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.529
I hope your memories didn't get wiped.

20:39.169 --> 20:40.349
That would be really horrible.

20:40.369 --> 20:41.090
We don't want that.

20:41.410 --> 20:41.990
Yeah.

20:43.050 --> 20:48.334
But it was a big event that all of hololive English was a part of!

20:48.354 --> 20:57.660
We went into a very special world, the kingdom of Lobesto, in a place that's kind of looking familiar to Minecraft, but different!

20:58.320 --> 21:00.501
And we solved some mysteries.

21:00.962 --> 21:03.063
Maybe got some memories back, maybe didn't.

21:03.103 --> 21:05.785
Maybe there was some sad things.

21:05.865 --> 21:06.225
But!

21:06.665 --> 21:06.785
Oh!

21:06.845 --> 21:08.647
The most important thing that I feel like

21:09.387 --> 21:10.628
Many people forgot.

21:10.828 --> 21:12.569
Oh, is that not their memories?

21:13.109 --> 21:13.409
No.

21:13.730 --> 21:13.870
Oh.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.931
And a record is roleplay.

21:17.792 --> 21:18.332
Ah!

21:18.452 --> 21:19.873
What does that mean, Moco-chan?

21:19.913 --> 21:26.337
That means that the Fuwawa and the Mococo that you see there are different.

21:26.697 --> 21:27.698
Different?

21:28.058 --> 21:31.040
Different, like, different, different.

21:32.100 --> 21:32.320
Ah!

21:32.560 --> 21:33.421
It's not, it's not.

21:34.864 --> 21:36.165
Mococo!

21:36.705 --> 21:39.106
You're not Mococo, you're Mococo.

21:39.126 --> 21:42.727
You put it like that?

21:42.787 --> 21:43.027
Yes.

21:44.447 --> 21:49.129
You remember that now?

21:49.549 --> 21:51.250
Well, it's FWC.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.691
The FW is a little different, right?

21:55.611 --> 21:56.451
You know, the FW is FWC.

21:58.393 --> 21:58.653
Wow.

21:59.353 --> 22:00.814
She really loves her chickens.

22:01.314 --> 22:01.434
Ah!

22:01.554 --> 22:02.575
Bread smell!

22:03.155 --> 22:06.117
But the Fuwawa never go love the chickens.

22:06.517 --> 22:10.038
It doesn't mean that the Fuwawa here right now doesn't like chickens too, huh?

22:10.339 --> 22:11.039
They're handy.

22:11.159 --> 22:11.679
Fluffy.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.180
Sometimes.

22:13.877 --> 22:21.279
Ruffians, you should be looking at this, right?

22:37.555 --> 22:39.297
Did you notice the difference?

22:39.317 --> 22:39.938
The cape!

22:40.098 --> 22:40.759
Not the cape.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.362
You thought it was just the cape, huh?

22:43.522 --> 22:44.783
But you were wrong!

22:44.803 --> 22:46.005
Not the cape.

22:50.718 --> 22:50.919
Oh!

22:51.099 --> 22:52.099
I see- Oh!

22:52.160 --> 22:53.861
Two Ruffians- Three Ruffians!

22:53.961 --> 22:54.421
Yes!

22:55.242 --> 22:57.364
No headband!

22:57.824 --> 22:59.045
Yeah!

23:00.606 --> 23:03.008
See the Mocoi- Mococo!

23:03.269 --> 23:14.338
The Mococo with no headband was thought to have mercilessly killed- Mercilessly killed Fuwawa's beloved chickens.

23:17.254 --> 23:20.496
Actually, that Mococo is innocent!

23:33.002 --> 23:34.022
No, no, no.

23:34.082 --> 23:35.082
What happened?

23:35.222 --> 23:36.103
What happened?

23:36.523 --> 23:39.963
She was trying to close the gate door into the chicken pen.

23:40.183 --> 23:42.904
So that all the chickens stay inside the pen.

23:42.924 --> 23:46.304
Because Fuwawa's friend is trying to be helpful.

23:47.665 --> 23:53.046
But she mis-pressed the button and used revelation and killed them all.

23:54.126 --> 23:56.626
That was pretty horrifying to watch, huh?

23:57.126 --> 24:01.247
If you go back and listen, you can hear the horror in her voice, okay?

24:02.298 --> 24:03.939
I'm innocent.

24:04.459 --> 24:05.580
Likely story.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.381
Likely story, Hans.

24:07.702 --> 24:08.022
No!

24:08.442 --> 24:09.783
It's a misunderstanding!

24:10.323 --> 24:11.404
You understand now.

24:13.005 --> 24:13.946
Not join!

24:14.026 --> 24:17.428
You have to go take a look at the evidence of maybe Ruffians.

24:17.448 --> 24:17.668
Okay.

24:17.908 --> 24:20.490
And then you can be true.

24:20.550 --> 24:22.211
No, no, no, no, no, no!

24:22.271 --> 24:23.732
We are telling them!

24:24.532 --> 24:26.493
It is a misunderstanding!

24:26.513 --> 24:28.435
This is the truth.

24:28.975 --> 24:30.316
That's how a misunderstanding goes.

24:30.356 --> 24:31.517
Now you say, I understand.

24:32.556 --> 24:36.918
Has been a long time, but that's... Understandable.

24:37.299 --> 24:37.719
Got it?

24:39.320 --> 24:40.580
I didn't say understandable.

24:41.341 --> 24:41.921
Got it?

24:42.421 --> 24:43.322
I understand.

24:43.342 --> 24:45.843
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:46.504 --> 24:47.424
I understand.

24:47.444 --> 24:47.504
Yes.

24:48.124 --> 24:49.605
Got it?

24:49.645 --> 24:50.526
I understand.

24:50.546 --> 24:51.606
BAU BAU!

24:52.047 --> 24:54.828
BAU BAU!

24:54.888 --> 24:56.429
Misunderstanding.

24:56.489 --> 24:57.750
Misunderstanding?

24:58.290 --> 24:58.570
Clear.

24:59.010 --> 25:00.071
World of Tanks Blitz.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.984
BAU BAU!

25:06.846 --> 25:07.947
Well, it's Wednesday.

25:07.967 --> 25:09.969
It's Wednesday.

25:11.291 --> 25:13.473
Are you ready for Wednesday, Ruffians?

25:14.634 --> 25:15.595
Wednesday.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.698
Has it been a little rough so far this week?

25:20.419 --> 25:21.880
Wednesday.

25:21.940 --> 25:23.282
Maybe it's been a bit.

25:23.602 --> 25:25.344
Well, Wednesday's gonna be rough too.

25:26.707 --> 25:30.269
Maybe Moco-chan, you can make it not so rough on a Wednesday.

25:30.289 --> 25:34.491
BAU BAU!

25:35.291 --> 25:36.291
Ruffians!

25:37.852 --> 25:41.254
I think you should know what day it is, huh?

25:42.134 --> 25:45.095
Wednesday!

25:45.656 --> 25:49.897
Because this year is a Mococo Pup Talk!

25:50.598 --> 25:52.759
So you're gonna shoot straight from me.

25:52.779 --> 25:53.599
Mococo!

25:56.432 --> 25:59.235
Ruffians, it's Wednesday!

26:01.317 --> 26:02.038
And you know what?

26:03.439 --> 26:04.680
I feel like today...

26:06.162 --> 26:10.104
This year is going to be a different kind of Pup Talk.

26:11.365 --> 26:14.967
Today, I want to bless you with good feelings!

26:14.987 --> 26:18.669
It's not like every week I don't want to bless you with good feelings, but today especially!

26:18.989 --> 26:20.770
I want to bless you with good feelings!

26:21.531 --> 26:22.011
Okay.

26:22.731 --> 26:25.013
So, here I go!

26:25.933 --> 26:26.794
Wake up refreshed!

26:27.114 --> 26:28.154
Lots of energy!

26:28.475 --> 26:29.535
Voice is happy!

26:29.976 --> 26:30.696
A on the test!

26:31.076 --> 26:32.197
This is so comfortable!

26:32.637 --> 26:33.718
Super FUWAMOCO!

26:36.793 --> 26:45.615
That was a bit different.

26:45.675 --> 26:47.195
Yeah, it was Pup Talk mix.

26:48.236 --> 26:49.116
Pup Talk mix?

26:49.416 --> 26:50.676
Fire!

26:50.996 --> 26:51.616
Fire!

26:51.676 --> 26:52.456
Fire!

26:52.697 --> 26:53.177
Pup Talk.

26:53.757 --> 26:54.577
Boss is happy!

26:54.617 --> 26:55.597
It's a good time!

26:55.737 --> 26:58.658
It's a good time!

27:00.640 --> 27:02.041
Good luck everyone!

27:02.161 --> 27:04.542
BAU BAU!

27:04.682 --> 27:08.543
Well, let's take a look at our regular corners now.

27:08.563 --> 27:10.964
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.925
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

27:13.105 --> 27:15.626
We have De-den!

27:15.666 --> 27:17.907
Today's Doggie of the Day is Sienna!

27:17.967 --> 27:19.407
Sienna!

27:19.447 --> 27:20.908
She has cute eyes.

27:21.268 --> 27:22.669
Big puppy dog eyes.

27:23.609 --> 27:24.529
Oh, it's a voice.

27:24.609 --> 27:25.109
Right!

27:25.149 --> 27:26.790
Look at those eyebrows, too!

27:26.830 --> 27:28.790
Yeah, so curious!

27:28.830 --> 27:31.111
Yeah, those are so fleek!

27:31.151 --> 27:31.711
Right!

27:31.831 --> 27:36.392
Sienna's a rescue and super duper cute!

27:36.552 --> 27:38.212
And then she rescued you, right?

27:38.672 --> 27:39.232
Right!

27:39.312 --> 27:41.233
She rescued you!

27:41.693 --> 27:44.113
But look, she's just a big puppy!

27:44.393 --> 27:49.874
A big puppy with a big barker and an even bigger heart!

27:50.295 --> 27:51.875
And guess what, Moco-chan?

27:52.895 --> 27:56.736
Sienna loves to give overbearing cuddles too.

27:57.216 --> 27:57.916
Does she?

27:58.137 --> 27:58.677
Yeah.

27:59.817 --> 27:59.957
Oh.

28:00.737 --> 28:00.937
Oh.

28:01.137 --> 28:01.638
Interesting.

28:02.318 --> 28:03.298
Very cute.

28:03.418 --> 28:04.738
Very cute!

28:04.778 --> 28:08.860
FUWAMOCO-chan, how do you think Sienna BAU BAUs?

28:09.320 --> 28:12.821
I think like, when she wants to cuddle.

28:14.461 --> 28:15.141
BAU BAU!

28:15.982 --> 28:16.522
BAU BAU!

28:18.307 --> 28:20.411
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:30.863 --> 28:31.424
BAU BAU!

28:31.564 --> 28:33.565
BAU BAU!

28:33.946 --> 28:36.228
Wow, I don't need to say this really.

28:36.268 --> 28:38.149
We can all tell already.

28:38.449 --> 28:40.551
But Sienna's just so sweet.

28:40.631 --> 28:45.655
And you can see in those eyes just how happy she is to be a part of your family.

28:45.775 --> 28:47.056
A part of your heart!

28:48.037 --> 28:51.300
I hope that you know she lays on your lap even more.

28:51.420 --> 28:55.823
And that maybe she'll share some of those cuddles with us too.

28:55.863 --> 28:56.824
Yeah, okay!

28:56.844 --> 28:58.726
Nobody doesn't like cuddles.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.497
Right cuddles, please.

29:01.357 --> 29:03.519
BAU BAU!

29:04.660 --> 29:08.822
Next we have our Today I Went On A Walk!

29:09.203 --> 29:12.925
We have De-den!

29:13.646 --> 29:17.528
I like this kind of walk!

29:17.608 --> 29:20.710
Miracle boy!

29:20.790 --> 29:23.952
Your calico buddy blessed you with presents!

29:23.992 --> 29:25.333
You have been blessed!

29:25.674 --> 29:27.495
Oh my gosh!

29:27.855 --> 29:29.196
Treat, huh?

29:29.276 --> 29:30.216
In many ways.

29:31.197 --> 29:33.198
A treat for you, maybe.

29:33.558 --> 29:38.681
You have a treat there for the calico boy, too.

29:38.841 --> 29:42.503
Well, FUWAMOCO, we recommend this cat treat.

29:43.104 --> 29:44.304
Churu.

29:44.404 --> 29:48.887
I've heard that all cats can't resist the churu.

29:48.927 --> 29:50.788
Some less than others.

29:51.609 --> 29:52.029
Young.

29:52.989 --> 29:53.950
Young, huh?

29:55.392 --> 30:00.775
Bring Calico Buddy a churu and I'm sure... She'll be happy.

30:00.815 --> 30:01.515
He'll be happy.

30:02.216 --> 30:03.316
Buddy will be happy.

30:03.536 --> 30:03.896
Yeah.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.137
Hi!

30:06.018 --> 30:08.819
I saw some Calico facts there!

30:08.879 --> 30:09.679
Calico facts?

30:09.719 --> 30:13.221
Yeah, that Calico cats are 99% girls.

30:13.541 --> 30:14.442
I don't care!

30:14.862 --> 30:18.104
Cats are cute and that's all that matters!

30:20.145 --> 30:26.048
Well, you know if you bring some churu, maybe a calico bunny will be there lots in the future.

30:26.688 --> 30:32.672
And then you can have lots of fun with your calico-flavored walks.

30:32.732 --> 30:36.614
BAU BAU!

30:36.714 --> 30:37.294
So cute.

30:37.354 --> 30:39.695
I want to go on walks like that too.

30:39.996 --> 30:42.817
Teach me how to find walks like that.

30:43.517 --> 30:47.700
Well, on our Question of the Day, we have de-den!

30:48.660 --> 30:51.804
Hi FUWAMOCO!

30:51.884 --> 30:53.927
Summer is almost over.

30:54.147 --> 30:58.653
Do Fuwawa and Mococo have anything they would like to do or eat in the fall?

30:59.174 --> 31:05.462
It's also the season of sweet potatoes, so there will be many delicious sweets and other delicacies.

31:08.572 --> 31:10.273
First a secret, Ruffians!

31:10.653 --> 31:19.256
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, I did partake in a fall delicacy shortly beforehand, and I made a mistake.

31:19.697 --> 31:21.277
You know we have the delicious Sama.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.879
The Sama fish is good in the fall time.

31:25.339 --> 31:29.020
And so all FUWAMOCO Morning, I had a bone stuck in my throat.

31:29.241 --> 31:29.521
Yes.

31:29.801 --> 31:30.061
Yes.

31:32.407 --> 31:32.867
But!

31:32.927 --> 31:34.928
We really like sweet potatoes too!

31:34.948 --> 31:41.309
But Fuwawa, the whole time before hajimaru said, I don't know what I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna have.

31:41.329 --> 31:44.170
I couldn't get most of them because I have a bullet in my throat.

31:44.210 --> 31:47.550
I have to be like, Ruffians, I'm sorry right now!

31:47.850 --> 31:49.711
The summer, it's stuck!

31:50.071 --> 31:50.851
I'm sorry!

31:51.371 --> 31:52.311
But that's okay!

31:52.371 --> 31:54.412
You have to be careful, okay?

31:54.472 --> 31:56.632
But sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes!

31:57.072 --> 31:59.613
I wanna find the Yankee Moji-san!

31:59.713 --> 32:01.373
And then we wanna buy it all!

32:02.053 --> 32:05.694
Yaki-mo.

32:06.154 --> 32:08.675
Yaki-mo.

32:08.695 --> 32:19.538
I want to buy all the best potatoes in the Yaki-mo ojisan.

32:20.338 --> 32:27.000
You just hear the song in the distance and then... I'm looking forward to it.

32:27.940 --> 32:30.324
The fall time is wonderful too!

32:30.484 --> 32:35.031
It was a wonderful summer, but I'm sure there's going to be a wonderful fall waiting for us too!

32:35.071 --> 32:36.573
Let's make it fun again!

32:37.034 --> 32:39.177
BAU BAU!

32:39.217 --> 32:40.158
Thank you so much!

32:42.862 --> 32:45.204
I don't hear the day, the Question of the Day!

32:45.244 --> 32:45.584
Why?

32:45.624 --> 32:49.047
For sharing your walks with us, your Pero Sightings!

32:49.547 --> 32:50.608
Thank you, Ruffians!

32:50.688 --> 32:51.188
Thank you!

32:51.248 --> 32:55.532
Let's continue to be a big and fortified FUWAMOCO Morning by using the hashtag!

32:55.992 --> 32:56.612
Hashtag!

32:56.632 --> 32:59.034
FWMCMORNING!

32:59.455 --> 33:01.416
BAU BAU!

33:01.956 --> 33:06.420
Wow, next we have another stream coming right on up right!

33:06.500 --> 33:07.541
We have De-den!

33:08.982 --> 33:12.365
We're gonna be playing Elite Exorcist Miko!

33:12.465 --> 33:15.047
The newest game from hololive AP!

33:15.087 --> 33:16.488
It looks super fun.

33:16.508 --> 33:18.070
I'm really excited.

33:18.670 --> 33:22.674
It looks very very addicting but we're gonna make it.

33:23.802 --> 33:24.443
Are we?

33:24.803 --> 33:32.829
I know my Senchou-senpai was talking of great things about this game, so I'm very excited to try it out all together with you, my friends!

33:33.269 --> 33:35.271
Let's have a bunch of fun, okay?

33:35.291 --> 33:35.671
Okay!

33:35.791 --> 33:36.672
BAU BAU!

33:36.732 --> 33:37.773
BAU BAU!

33:37.813 --> 33:39.394
Let's take a peek at our schedule!

33:39.454 --> 33:41.135
FUWAMOCO's schedule!

33:41.495 --> 33:46.559
Oh, but... Unfortunately, earlier we couldn't quite play Donkey Kong Country 2, but... I'm sorry.

33:46.599 --> 33:49.622
Moco-chan, you're feeling much better from your mic right now.

33:49.662 --> 33:50.062
Yeah, I still...

33:50.959 --> 33:52.026
It's funny!

33:54.142 --> 33:56.664
It notches my head that hurts after everything hurts.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.286
But we're getting better, okay?

33:59.326 --> 34:02.449
We'll say hello to Donkey Kong Country 2 next week!

34:03.249 --> 34:09.835
And then on Friday, we have FUWAMOCO Morning followed by a nice cozy chat while we do some super chat reading.

34:10.375 --> 34:15.059
And then on Saturday, it's time for a rock n' roar party!

34:15.159 --> 34:16.600
Rock n' roar time!

34:16.680 --> 34:18.322
We hope you're ready, Ruffians.

34:18.762 --> 34:21.825
And then on Sunday, it's been a while since our last horror game.

34:22.265 --> 34:23.326
Maybe that was a good thing.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.008
But we're gonna be going to a bathhouse.

34:26.508 --> 34:27.549
One said two.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.830
A restored bathhouse.

34:29.370 --> 34:31.392
And hopefully we won't see anything scary.

34:31.412 --> 34:31.552
Yeah.

34:32.432 --> 34:32.933
Hopefully.

34:32.993 --> 34:33.473
Hopefully.

34:34.434 --> 34:37.416
And that's our schedule for this week, Ruffians!

34:37.776 --> 34:37.936
Oh!

34:38.236 --> 34:44.381
And for Ruffians who are joining us this morning through the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO Rune!
