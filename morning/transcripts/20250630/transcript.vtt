00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:02.607
Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:07.933
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:10.697
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:12.559
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.264
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:19.528
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.392
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:22.412 --> 00:05:23.173
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:30.253
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:30.473
BAU BAU!

00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:32.516
Good morning!

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:33.537
Are you awake?

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:35.680
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.912
Thank you for joining us today for our 165th episode!

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:47.136
Let's get awake!

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.164
You know it's the start of a new week.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.312
You better be late for it, Ruffians!

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:53.617
Still sleepy.

00:05:53.637 --> 00:05:55.624
I guess it can't be helped.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:07.170
Well, for those joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:09.152
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:12.575
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:13.016 --> 00:06:19.682
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays, once a week.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:24.767
So FUWAMOCO can get more balance in their lives, but also, PC-kun didn't agree to this last weekend,

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:33.981
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:37.590
Ah!

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.511
Moco-chan!

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:42.596
Please say it after the hashtag!

00:06:43.037 --> 00:06:43.898
Hashtag!

00:06:43.918 --> 00:06:44.699
FWMCMORNING!

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:48.944
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:49.364 --> 00:06:51.066
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:54.971
You better watch out Moco-chan, otherwise the Ruffians start saying it for you!

00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:57.454
It's been a while!

00:06:57.434 --> 00:06:59.157
BAU BAU!

00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:01.801
You have to say the line, Moco-chan!

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:06.207
You gotta say it, otherwise the Ruffians are gonna say the line for you!

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:07.710
Say the line, Moco-chan!

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:10.294
Is that how it goes?

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:10.955
Yeah!

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:12.116
Say the thing!

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:16.523
BAU BAU!

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:20.908
Well, you know, it's just about time to be a new month.

00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:22.389
It's basically a new month.

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:25.312
There's been a bunch of things going on.

00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:29.717
Let's take a look at them, Moco-chan.

00:07:29.737 --> 00:07:32.901
But first, Ruffians, you need to tell us.

00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.863
Our goal is to not go over an hour.

00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:37.606
Please start yelling if we are getting close.

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:41.650
So, FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.433
Well, let's get to our first news of the day!

00:07:45.453 --> 00:07:47.155
First thing is disappointing!

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:52.560
Moco-chan, we've had... The summer time is just about here!

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.582
There's a bunch of good things in the summer time!

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:56.343
July is officially summer!

00:07:58.625 --> 00:07:59.366
It's the easiest way.

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:00.587
You know the boundary, yeah.

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:05.812
Well, the disappointing part is always that, so I guess that... That was sighted.

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:11.417
Another Pero sighting.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.472
Is it something nasty?

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.198
Potentially.

00:08:17.218 --> 00:08:17.799
We don't know yet.

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:21.226
Let's take a look what Pero was sighted.

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:22.969
Here we go.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.598
3, 2, 1.

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:31.245
De-den!

00:08:31.732 --> 00:08:33.474
D-DJ Pero!

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:34.135
What?

00:08:34.776 --> 00:08:35.537
B-Bau?

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:37.560
He's DJing now!

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.989
I don't know, does anyone honestly want to go to a club where Pero's in charge of the music?

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.152
Nasty Beats?

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:46.432
Ruffians!

00:08:47.073 --> 00:08:48.976
It's DJ Moco-chan!

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:55.184
Yeah, of course you wanna go, but... Not you, no.

00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:56.146
Not you.

00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:56.767
No.

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:57.047
No.

00:08:57.348 --> 00:09:03.438
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:17.702
Have a howl of a day!

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:19.306
That's a good question.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:25.495
Maybe... If you just feel the beat in his two bones inside.

00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:28.599
It just goes right into his body, through the muscles, into the bones.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.990
Maybe... Yeah, well... Yeah, I'm sure his mashups were extra nasty.

00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:38.251
Yeah.

00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:38.612
Yeah.

00:09:38.632 --> 00:09:41.075
You know, maybe some Ruffians have fun.

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:42.197
Maybe.

00:09:42.217 --> 00:09:42.677
Maybe.

00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:44.520
I guess they make us happy, right, Moco-chan?

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.741
I guess they make us happy, right, Moco-chan?

00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:46.322
I mean, fun is always good.

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:56.397

00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:25.993
We released a new cover song!

00:10:26.654 --> 00:10:26.754
Yeah!

00:10:26.774 --> 00:10:27.856
But not just any cover song!

00:10:27.876 --> 00:10:35.587
A cover of the song Feeling Heart from Chihuahua!

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:35.987
Yeah!

00:10:36.207 --> 00:10:36.388
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:43.157
See, Mofans, you know FUWAMOCO, we actually sung Feeling Heart during our birthday lives in the old FUWAMOCO.

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:45.101
Ruffians, this time it's different.

00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.689
You know FUWAMOCO always wanted to at least cover a feeling heart from ToHeart.

00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:54.582
If you don't know what ToHeart is, ToHeart is a classic, legendary visual novel.

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:58.210
And also our favorite visual novel ToHeart is like...

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.318
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:06.103
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:06.263 --> 00:11:09.147
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:22.088
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:27.042
Thank you Aqua for the support!

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:27.323
It's so good!

00:11:27.343 --> 00:11:27.603
It's so good!

00:11:27.623 --> 00:11:30.190
You know we got to play... We got to play the demo.

00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:30.953
Not enough.

00:11:30.973 --> 00:11:32.938
Not enough at all.

00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:36.359
Sorry I fought with Mari-chan a bit.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.803
I wanted to play as much as we could.

00:11:38.983 --> 00:11:47.976
It was so much fun and we're so happy to finally be able to share something very special close to our hearts.

00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.299
You know, true hearts together with you, Ruffians.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.563
And especially our cover of Feeling Heart.

00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:53.144
We love it!

00:11:53.164 --> 00:11:56.548
If you could go take a listen, we put everything into it.

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:57.610
Another big

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:04.219
Thank you to Aqours for creating such a gorgeous video just like the original opening!

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.823
You really need to go check it out, Ruffians!

00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:08.045
Don't miss it!

00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:17.579
You know, Feeling Hearts has been a song that we've listened to that we've loved so so so so so many human dog years.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:23.407
So we're really happy to be able to sing a song that's so close to our hearts for you, Ruffians!

00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:24.949
I think our feelings are going across.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.331
Maybe.

00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:31.196
So we hope that you'll listen to it and that you'll check out QHeart, you know, it's a legend!

00:12:31.557 --> 00:12:33.939
The legendary love comedy visual novel.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.205
Our favorite heroine, our waifu, and the next FUWAMOCO.

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:40.667
But play her route at the end.

00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:40.907
Yeah.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.228
On.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.371
QHeart again!

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:45.292
Yes!

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:45.452
QHeart!

00:12:46.373 --> 00:12:48.355
It's very close to IHeart.

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:51.098
But, um... On the topic of QHeart!

00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:52.099
You're like...

00:12:53.463 --> 00:13:16.467
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:29.713
20 lucky Ruffians will win.

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:37.264
I hope I'm part of that!

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:49.005
So please go repost, reshare, retweet, and also Ruffians, make sure you have a Japanese mailing address in the lucky case that you happen to be one of those 20 Ruffians.

00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:50.989
I'm sure you know what's it, what's it, what's it.

00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.470
What's it called?

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.832
What's it called, Moco-chan?

00:13:52.812 --> 00:13:56.238
I'm so excited!

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:00.786
This is gonna be a challenge!

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:03.691
You see it?

00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:09.100
It says FUWAMOCOXToHeart.

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:11.829
Do you see that?

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:17.677
This acrylic block did not attack my body, but I sure feel like I've been, like, hit in the heart!

00:14:18.178 --> 00:14:20.661
Hit in the heart with an acrylic block!

00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:20.742
Ow!

00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:20.862
Yeah.

00:14:22.103 --> 00:14:23.585
Can I just have all 20 of them?

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:24.827
I know, right?

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:26.970
I don't like all 20 of them, Ruffians, so... Dominoes.

00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:29.233
You know what you're supposed to do now.

00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:31.176
Dominoes!

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:31.997
Moco-chan!

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:32.758
Dominoes!

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.965
I think we have to treasure them a little bit more than that.

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:47.168
It'll be cute dominoes.

00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:47.509
BAU BAU!

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:49.273
And thank you for your cooperation!

00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:50.756
Thank you!

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:50.936
BAU BAU!

00:14:51.818 --> 00:14:51.978
BAU BAU!

00:14:51.998 --> 00:14:52.159
BAU BAU!

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:52.840
BAU BAU!

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.397
Hi.

00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:58.569
FUWAMOCO just having big big dreams come true.

00:14:58.589 --> 00:15:00.195
Dreams that we never thought could come true.

00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:00.737
That's all.

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:01.259
That's all.

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:01.921
Casual.

00:15:02.021 --> 00:15:03.808
Normal stuff.

00:15:05.088 --> 00:15:18.749
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:18.849 --> 00:15:22.095
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:33.272
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:33.252 --> 00:15:42.909
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:50.282
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:15:50.262 --> 00:16:07.258
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:16:07.238 --> 00:16:09.360
Space on the field always limited.

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.682
First come, first served.

00:16:10.702 --> 00:16:12.044
That makes sense, you can't fit everyone.

00:16:13.445 --> 00:16:18.892
But you know you can bring your penlights and get ready to dance because there's a special dance party!

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:19.973
Yes, the dance party!

00:16:19.993 --> 00:16:21.455
They're letting you know the set list.

00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:25.539
So you better get really ready to- Grapple partner?

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.082
Grapple partner!

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:29.584
How you doin'?

00:16:29.564 --> 00:16:45.103
Make sure you get all prepared.

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:51.050
You can practice.

00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:54.795
Maybe meet up with some Ruffians beforehand.

00:16:54.775 --> 00:16:56.738
Not this!

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.462
But that's not it!

00:16:59.542 --> 00:17:02.546
Cosplay is also allowed you know!

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.328
There are some small rules.

00:17:04.489 --> 00:17:05.490
In the small print there.

00:17:06.331 --> 00:17:09.496
But it is allowed!

00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:12.520
So you know I'm sure your FUWAMOCO happy.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.643
Who do you like to cosplay as?

00:17:14.663 --> 00:17:16.666
I think you have the perfect costume you know.

00:17:16.686 --> 00:17:17.166
Oh maybe.

00:17:18.128 --> 00:17:21.833
You could cosplay as FUWAMOCO!

00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:21.913
Hi.

00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:23.389
No!

00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:25.715
I could cosplay as you, Moco-chan!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.620
I guess that would work, right?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.602
And then no one would know.

00:17:29.143 --> 00:17:30.627
Right?

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:36.681
But also, also, also!

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:38.265
We have...

00:17:38.245 --> 00:17:41.351
YAGOO-san's gonna be doing the first page!

00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:41.571
Yes!

00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:42.553
In the flesh!

00:17:42.814 --> 00:17:45.479
Moco-chan, do you think you can throw better than YAGOO-san?

00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:46.500
I really think I can.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:51.690
Well, maybe you can go Ruffians and see just how well YAGOO-san does.

00:17:51.951 --> 00:17:53.854
Moco-chan, you know you're up next time.

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:54.956
I know.

00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:56.980
I think I can do better.

00:17:58.529 --> 00:18:02.473
He might do really, really well, but I still... I think I can do better!

00:18:02.513 --> 00:18:04.234
We'll see.

00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:06.797
These are demon dog arms, okay?

00:18:06.817 --> 00:18:06.957
Yeah!

00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:08.258
That's how you do it, right?

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.120
Also!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.882
There's gonna be exclusive merch, of course!

00:18:13.103 --> 00:18:15.665
But also food and beverages!

00:18:15.685 --> 00:18:17.947
They're just so cute!

00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:18.347
The popcorn bucket!

00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:19.088
Right!

00:18:19.108 --> 00:18:21.070
That would be perfect for watch-alongs, right?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:21.691
Right!

00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:24.133
You can bring it home and you can put more popcorn in it!

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:25.414
Make sure you maybe clean it.

00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:40.433
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:41.214
And!

00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:44.417
There's also gonna be mascots!

00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:44.837
Yeah, it is!

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:45.358
Dogs!

00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:48.020
Subaru dogs!

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.141
Indeed, they're gonna be there too!

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.784
And you can get some photos with them!

00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:54.867
Subaru-senpai and Oni-senpai's mascot characters!

00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:55.607
It's so cute!

00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:57.109
Pero's gonna be there!

00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:59.691
I don't know, Ruffians, you're gonna have to let us know!

00:19:01.893 --> 00:19:04.155
But you know it's happening so soon, July 5th!

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:04.656
Yeah!

00:19:06.998 --> 00:19:07.078
And!

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:09.061
Tickets!

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:09.782
There's tickets available!

00:19:09.802 --> 00:19:12.165
You can go to the dodgies.com slash hololive.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:14.369
I thought, you know, maybe they were sold out, but... Why?

00:19:14.389 --> 00:19:15.310
It sounds so exciting.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.094
There's... It's a big stadium, you know?

00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:20.217
It's a big stadium.

00:19:20.237 --> 00:19:20.738
There are still tickets!

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:24.463
You can click the buy now at the holo, and then enter the offer code.

00:19:25.225 --> 00:19:25.305
See?

00:19:25.325 --> 00:19:25.405
See?

00:19:25.425 --> 00:19:26.426
I thought all tickets were sold out.

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:27.929
They are not!

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:28.389
There's still tickets!

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:28.990
There's still tickets!

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.813
You know, maybe, but I don't really know baseball.

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:32.135
Then it's perfect, you know?

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:36.441
I think there's seats away from the people that are really interested in baseball.

00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:38.284
I think this is the most popular seats.

00:19:38.965 --> 00:19:40.987
I thought the other seats that were left were really good.

00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:42.530
Oh, that looks like a really good seat.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.592
But, maybe, maybe not.

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:46.896
It's kind of far from how the baseball happens to be.

00:19:46.996 --> 00:19:50.961
I forgot about that part.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:54.666
So, definitely, if you're in the area, do not miss this night to remember, okay?

00:19:54.687 --> 00:19:55.127
I'm so excited.

00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:56.970
I wanna go!

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.673
Oh, there's roll-in section seats.

00:20:00.354 --> 00:20:01.576
I didn't know there were such things.

00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:02.918
Those are the seats you want then.

00:20:02.898 --> 00:20:07.044
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:24.568
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:20:24.937 --> 00:20:26.879
Enjoy your baseball!

00:20:28.922 --> 00:20:29.082
BAU BAU!

00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.045
And what do they say when they do the good thing in baseball?

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:32.467
Strike!

00:20:32.847 --> 00:20:33.668
Get ball!

00:20:33.688 --> 00:20:35.410
Is that how it goes?

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.572
Play ball!

00:20:37.393 --> 00:20:39.335
Yes, play ball!

00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:40.837
That's what I was thinking.

00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.803
BAU BAU!

00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:46.424
And also!

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.088
Well, you know, lots of things happen in LA.

00:20:49.969 --> 00:20:51.771
It's serious, right?

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:55.295
There's going to be a big Anime Expo happening!

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:58.079
And there's going to be the AXSCRIPT!

00:20:58.219 --> 00:21:00.342
AXSCRIPT's going to be making an appearance there!

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.727
There's the Shibuya Style Design Coco and Anime Pop-Up!

00:21:05.228 --> 00:21:09.053
And it's going from Shibuya all the way to LA!

00:21:09.073 --> 00:21:13.779
You can see it at AX Anime Expo July 3rd to 6th!

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.442
There won't be the life-size...

00:21:16.422 --> 00:21:17.964
FUWAMOCO deshita.

00:21:17.984 --> 00:21:18.725
No, that makes sense.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:25.133
But there will be the 1-7-I script FUWAMOCO figures on display!

00:21:25.173 --> 00:21:29.538
So you can see them in person, how beautiful they are!

00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:30.600
As well as exclusive merch too!

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.266
Up until now you had to go all the way to Shibuya in Japan to get your paws on them.

00:21:35.286 --> 00:21:37.428
But now it's going to LA!

00:21:37.448 --> 00:21:38.710
So hopefully it's cool soon.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.835
Right, and we look so cool in our zero gravity battle outfits!

00:21:42.815 --> 00:21:49.565
So we hope that you'll get your paws on them and maybe take a few photos of the 1-7 FUWAMOCO figures too!

00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:53.590
The 1-1 scale statues got taken to our doghouse.

00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:56.494
That would be nice.

00:21:56.514 --> 00:21:59.458
They're still in Shibuya!

00:21:59.478 --> 00:22:00.420
Shibuya style!

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.523
But yeah, unfortunately we're not making their way there.

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:09.613
You can't see them in Shibuya if you're in Shibuya.

00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:09.793
BAU BAU!

00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:11.235
Press Icomo if you'd like to enter the Expo!

00:22:11.215 --> 00:22:14.739
Thank you!

00:22:18.584 --> 00:22:18.804
Ruffians!

00:22:18.944 --> 00:22:22.849
Even more exciting news really soon!

00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:28.876
A very special senpai of ours is having her birthday!

00:22:31.159 --> 00:22:33.362
ASCII-senpai is having a birthday live at FUWAMOCO!

00:22:33.382 --> 00:22:35.945
We're gonna be there!

00:22:35.965 --> 00:22:36.045
Yes!

00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:36.426
Oh my mama!

00:22:36.446 --> 00:22:38.488
It's gonna be happening July 1st at 8!

00:22:38.468 --> 00:22:47.112
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:47.918 --> 00:22:53.807
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:55.309 --> 00:23:01.779
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:10.392
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:16.862
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:16.842 --> 00:23:22.690
Amazing, beautiful singing, but she has a very interesting song choice for a karaoke stream.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.354
The way you said it makes it sound negative.

00:23:25.374 --> 00:23:25.434
No!

00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:29.259
You know, it's like, oh, this song!

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:29.379
Yeah!

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:29.499
Yeah!

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.903
You know, like, oh, I'm so surprised.

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:35.468
Yeah, we were talking to AZKi-senpai about, you know, karaoke songs too, right?

00:23:35.488 --> 00:23:35.608
Right!

00:23:35.628 --> 00:23:39.373
Like, there's been so many good karaoke songs!

00:23:40.028 --> 00:23:44.554
That's all AZKi-senpai.

00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:50.542
But you know, I wonder what kind of song we might be singing all together.

00:23:50.682 --> 00:23:56.710
It's because of AZKi-senpai and FUWAMOCO, just so you know.

00:23:59.253 --> 00:23:59.353
Yeah.

00:23:59.373 --> 00:23:59.974
Happy birthday!

00:23:59.994 --> 00:24:05.081
It's still a little bit early, but happy birthday AZKi-senpai!

00:24:05.101 --> 00:24:09.867
It's still a little bit birthday, but happy early.

00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:17.730
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:24:18.048 --> 00:24:26.718
And continuing on all the exciting things, there was some big, big news for FUWAMOCO!

00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:28.079
Oh, and more big news.

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:33.526
It was just announced that FUWAMOCO were making our debut as writers.

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:43.317
Because FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be having a column in the Legendary Gaming Magazine Weekly Family 2!

00:24:43.337 --> 00:24:43.437
Yeah!

00:24:43.457 --> 00:24:43.617
BAU BAU!

00:24:43.597 --> 00:24:48.685
We're so excited!

00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:55.395
It's a huge honor!

00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:55.695
Right?

00:24:55.715 --> 00:24:56.476
Amazing!

00:24:56.496 --> 00:25:01.664
And Koyori-senpai, she's gonna be having her own column too!

00:25:01.684 --> 00:25:06.751
So FUWAMOCO code and Koyori-senpai's column in the following weeks after us.

00:25:07.432 --> 00:25:12.540
But you know, FUWAMOCO, what are you writing about in a gaming magazine?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.148
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:29.588
Have a howl of a day!

00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:33.875
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:35.237
Have a howl of a day!

00:25:35.217 --> 00:25:56.280
We hope you can get your paws on it Ruffians!

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.727
But there will, I think there should also be digital versions that you can get online.

00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:03.389
We don't know, but we're thinking.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:09.598
Yeah, so you know if maybe going to your local konbini to get your paws on it is a little bit tricky.

00:26:09.618 --> 00:26:10.499
Understandable.

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:12.682
I'd really be happy if you could check out the two.

00:26:12.702 --> 00:26:14.965
You can buy it digitally!

00:26:14.985 --> 00:26:15.565
Yes!

00:26:15.585 --> 00:26:15.786
Okay!

00:26:15.806 --> 00:26:15.906
Yeah!

00:26:16.907 --> 00:26:17.007
Okay!

00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:18.389
Is there an English version?

00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:22.875
BAU BAU.

00:26:23.564 --> 00:26:39.902
I'm sure there are things that can help you.

00:26:39.882 --> 00:26:44.490
BAU BAU!

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.292
We're really excited!

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.213
We'll do our bestest!

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:49.539
Ride a demon dog, FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:55.630
BAU BAU!

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.233
Excited!

00:26:57.253 --> 00:27:05.509
Today is not just a lot of excitement going on, but it's also a special day!

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:07.112
A special day!

00:27:07.132 --> 00:27:09.436
We have something to celebrate!

00:27:09.457 --> 00:27:10.318
Celebration!

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.905
A pair of Ruffians!

00:27:14.386 --> 00:27:18.073
They're actually getting married!

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:34.189
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:34.169 --> 00:27:53.089
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:54.033
Wedding.

00:27:54.814 --> 00:27:58.682
Happy year!

00:27:58.982 --> 00:28:07.578
We're really happy for you!

00:28:07.658 --> 00:28:08.159
Congratulations!

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.402
Soon to be happy-pumpy!

00:28:12.087 --> 00:28:13.149
BAU BAU!

00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:14.892
Wait, I just realized!

00:28:15.395 --> 00:28:16.618
What?

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:20.088
BAU BAU!

00:28:20.108 --> 00:28:20.429
Wow!

00:28:21.832 --> 00:28:25.101
A lot's going on!

00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:29.164
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:29.564 --> 00:28:38.721
We're gonna be making a big appearance at Cho-Cho-Cho-Cho Game Race 2 at Saitama Super Arena!

00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:46.836
Game Race is having a big event happening on July 5th and 6th, so FUWAMOCO, we've been invited as guests for the 6th.

00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:49.141
The 66th day of the event!

00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:51.005
In person!

00:28:51.025 --> 00:28:54.132
With a bunch of Ruffians!

00:28:54.412 --> 00:29:00.926
Lots of gamers fans!

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:02.028
Lots of hearts!

00:29:02.048 --> 00:29:03.812
Super Arena.

00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:06.375
Can I say Choco-chan?

00:29:06.395 --> 00:29:06.796
Choco-chan!

00:29:08.178 --> 00:29:17.090
We'll be there together with Mikocchi-senpai and Subaru-senpai!

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.290
Fuwamico!

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.490
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:24.620
We'll definitely be getting into some silly times, playing some games maybe here and there.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:24.980
Chiyoi!

00:29:25.601 --> 00:29:26.162
Gamers!

00:29:26.182 --> 00:29:27.263
Let's go!

00:29:27.283 --> 00:29:27.724
BAU BAU!

00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:30.770
We're so excited!

00:29:31.151 --> 00:29:35.799
We're really excited to be able to see some Ruffians who are going to be coming to cheer us on there.

00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:39.406
And you know, everybody there for gamers too!

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:43.975
And you know, even if you can't go, there are streaming tickets!

00:29:43.955 --> 00:29:45.096
Yes!

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:50.442
They're available on Abema Live, so I really hope that you can join us there too, Ruffians!

00:29:51.003 --> 00:30:00.193
And I'm sure most of you know this if you're curious about what happened at last Chou Gamers, there's also an archive of that as well on Abema Live!

00:30:00.934 --> 00:30:06.680
I'm excited to go on the first Chou Gamers Live with all 4 gamers!

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.342
It's gonna be so much fun!

00:30:08.322 --> 00:30:10.084
We're so, so excited!

00:30:10.104 --> 00:30:11.086
I wanted to be guest too!

00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:12.928
Will there be a preview?

00:30:12.948 --> 00:30:14.930
I don't think so, but I don't know.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.812
I don't know.

00:30:16.172 --> 00:30:17.794
I'm pretty sure there wasn't.

00:30:17.814 --> 00:30:18.255
Don't be cool!

00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.277
I'm pretty sure there wasn't last time, right?

00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:21.439
Oh, I'm not sure.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.181
I don't think so.

00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.082
But you never know!

00:30:24.883 --> 00:30:26.926
Yeah.

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:28.768
Please check it out!

00:30:28.788 --> 00:30:29.249
I'll be online!

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:31.872
Not YouTube.

00:30:36.278 --> 00:30:36.838
No.

00:30:36.858 --> 00:30:37.019
BAU BAU!

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:37.199
BAU BAU!

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.160
Ruffians!

00:30:38.444 --> 00:30:41.528
I don't know what to call this.

00:30:42.209 --> 00:30:42.750
Let's have an update.

00:30:43.531 --> 00:30:44.493
Well, I guess it's happy.

00:30:44.513 --> 00:30:45.254
Ruffians, you know our friend, right?

00:30:45.274 --> 00:31:05.042
The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended up... The one we ended

00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:09.079
We got a new family member!

00:31:10.103 --> 00:31:10.183
Yay!

00:31:10.203 --> 00:31:13.737
Someone to keep the friend a little bit company.

00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:13.958
Yay!

00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:16.308
I feel mixed on this Moco-chan.

00:31:16.328 --> 00:31:16.669
I feel mixed too.

00:31:17.932 --> 00:31:24.678
So, today, you know, when we were going to the studio, we had a big day of recording.

00:31:25.459 --> 00:31:27.961
But when we were walking there, we noticed something.

00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:29.402
It's lying on the ground.

00:31:29.982 --> 00:31:33.005
There was a big, beautiful butterfly!

00:31:33.385 --> 00:31:34.987
One of the biggest we've ever seen!

00:31:35.868 --> 00:31:38.530
And it wasn't moving, but you know, it was really hot!

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.352
So we thought, maybe I'll maybe just collapse something.

00:31:41.372 --> 00:31:43.854
You know, it's so hot out.

00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:46.277
Yeah, maybe I just need some sugar.

00:31:46.417 --> 00:31:47.938
So we picked it up and we...

00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:51.770
Took it over with us to the studio and then Morning-chan was like, I'm FUWAMOCO!

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.658
And we're like... Morning-chan!

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.684
What should we do?

00:31:56.705 --> 00:31:58.891
The butterfly's passed out!

00:31:59.573 --> 00:32:01.860
And Morning-chan was like... Huh?

00:32:03.764 --> 00:32:15.457
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:31.695
Have a howl of a day!

00:32:35.017 --> 00:32:41.268
So we did what you would normally do.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.414
Took a little plastic baggie.

00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:47.500
And we took it home!

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.263
I can go in now!

00:32:49.283 --> 00:32:55.354
I can keep our other friend, our cicada friend company until doing this and finally take ownership.

00:32:55.823 --> 00:33:01.109
BABOO YOU'RE SUCH A BIG BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY!

00:33:01.129 --> 00:33:02.971
Should we give her the name Moco-chan?

00:33:03.011 --> 00:33:04.933
What should we name her?

00:33:04.953 --> 00:33:06.015
Well Abyss, what should we name her?

00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.516
Cuz we can't just say a friend.

00:33:08.017 --> 00:33:08.798
Yeah.

00:33:08.818 --> 00:33:09.719
No, we have two friends.

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:10.280
It's confusing.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.342
It looks exactly like this.

00:33:12.362 --> 00:33:12.863
Yeah.

00:33:13.804 --> 00:33:14.645
Cho-cho.

00:33:14.925 --> 00:33:15.606
Cho-cho?

00:33:15.966 --> 00:33:17.228
We're calling it Cho-cho.

00:33:17.368 --> 00:33:18.189
Cho-cho.

00:33:18.249 --> 00:33:19.350
Cho-cho.

00:33:19.803 --> 00:33:22.147
FUWAMOCO and CHO-CHO!

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:23.890
Put CHO-CHO like CHO-CHO-CHO gamers.

00:33:24.632 --> 00:33:25.353
CHO-CHO.

00:33:25.373 --> 00:33:27.136
Oh, like super super!

00:33:27.377 --> 00:33:27.617
Super super!

00:33:27.637 --> 00:33:28.319
CHO-CHO!

00:33:28.499 --> 00:33:29.180
CHO-CHO!

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.003
CHO-CHO-CHO ii kanji.

00:33:31.204 --> 00:33:32.166
Yes, like that!

00:33:32.426 --> 00:33:35.492
Stop doing that.

00:33:35.512 --> 00:33:36.814
Stop doing that.

00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:40.581
But you know, it's beautiful.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:40.681
Yes!

00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:41.102
It's super nice.

00:33:41.543 --> 00:33:43.887
A little bit of complicated feelings.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.035
My new family member!

00:33:47.055 --> 00:33:50.702
BAU BAU!

00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:52.565
Where is it?

00:33:53.086 --> 00:33:56.633
It's on the... in the kitchen.

00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:59.979
The plastic bag has a hole in it, but it's okay.

00:34:03.265 --> 00:34:05.048
BAU BAU!

00:34:06.445 --> 00:34:10.849
Make sure, Ruffians, make sure that the heat doesn't get to you, okay?

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.192
Don't end up like Jojo, okay?

00:34:13.732 --> 00:34:16.255
How are you feeling, though?

00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:18.858
The heat's not getting to you yet, is it?

00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:21.080
Hopefully not.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.862
It's been hot, it's been hot!

00:34:23.803 --> 00:34:25.144
I'm staying hydrated!

00:34:25.184 --> 00:34:26.726
You're not gonna die!

00:34:27.086 --> 00:34:27.927
No.

00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:30.029
You might just fall over.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:35.895
Do you have anything that could help remedy those kind of... You know, the...

00:34:38.018 --> 00:34:41.782
FUWAMOCO Feelings.

00:34:41.802 --> 00:34:42.182
FUWAMOCO Worries.

00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:43.243
FUWAMOCO Worries?

00:34:45.005 --> 00:34:45.326
FUWAMOCO Yeah.

00:34:45.406 --> 00:34:45.666
FUWAMOCO Huh?

00:34:45.686 --> 00:34:46.287
FUWAMOCO I don't think so.

00:34:46.347 --> 00:34:47.548
FUWAMOCO Don't think so?

00:34:47.568 --> 00:34:49.770
FUWAMOCO I don't think so.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.112
FUWAMOCO Maybe you could try.

00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:52.313
FUWAMOCO Huh?

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.094
FUWAMOCO A talk of sorts?

00:34:53.114 --> 00:34:55.416
FUWAMOCO You would like a talk of sorts?

00:34:55.436 --> 00:34:57.038
FUWAMOCO A little bit of a... FUWAMOCO A sort?

00:34:57.058 --> 00:35:06.788
FUWAMOCO Like how I'm doing right now?

00:35:06.808 --> 00:35:07.228
FUWAMOCO A pup talk.

00:35:07.248 --> 00:35:07.789
FUWAMOCO Wow!

00:35:08.512 --> 00:35:10.374
If you say so I guess.

00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:18.522
Ruffians!

00:35:18.562 --> 00:35:22.466
It's been a while, but it's that time again!

00:35:23.167 --> 00:35:26.070
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.973
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:35:31.075 --> 00:35:32.096
Ruffians!

00:35:32.796 --> 00:35:35.599
It's the end of the month and guess what?

00:35:37.132 --> 00:35:38.214
You did it!

00:35:38.655 --> 00:35:39.697
You made it!

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.039
You got through it all!

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:48.393
You know, I'm sure there is busy times and rough days where you thought to yourself, How am I gonna make it through today?

00:35:48.854 --> 00:35:49.856
But, you know what?

00:35:50.457 --> 00:35:51.358
You did it!

00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:53.122
And you'll continue to do it!

00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:53.943
You know?

00:35:54.304 --> 00:36:00.355
So make sure to celebrate those times when you overcome something big that was weighing on you, okay?

00:36:00.689 --> 00:36:05.334
You have the strength to make it past anything that stands in your way, so believe in yourself!

00:36:06.074 --> 00:36:06.335
Or else.

00:36:07.155 --> 00:36:07.476
Okay?

00:36:07.536 --> 00:36:13.442
There are lots of fun things coming up in summer, so let's get ready to rock July!

00:36:14.122 --> 00:36:15.544
Ganbatte de!

00:36:15.624 --> 00:36:17.245
Mawai!

00:36:18.086 --> 00:36:19.548
Oppa!

00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:22.190
Thank you, Moco-chan!

00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:23.912
Or else, yes.

00:36:24.192 --> 00:36:29.237
Or else, okay.

00:36:29.257 --> 00:36:29.478
Let's rock!

00:36:29.498 --> 00:36:29.818
Rock July!

00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:33.085
BAU BAU!

00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:35.050
I think it's time.

00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:36.853
Time for FUWAMOCOchat.

00:36:36.874 --> 00:36:39.880
The Doggie of the Day!

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.871
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Den!

00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:52.498
FUWAMOCO!

00:36:58.504 --> 00:37:08.993
FUWAMOCO!

00:37:09.254 --> 00:37:12.176
FUWAMOCO!

00:37:12.537 --> 00:37:12.917
FUWAMOCO!

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:17.604
Oreo's already a menace and he will destroy toys if he's having fun.

00:37:18.044 --> 00:37:19.226
I get that.

00:37:19.466 --> 00:37:20.728
We all feel like that, right?

00:37:20.748 --> 00:37:23.072
Does it count as a menace?

00:37:23.092 --> 00:37:24.814
Some would call that a menace.

00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:28.660
That's normal.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.484
Moco-chan, how does Oreo BAU BAU?

00:37:32.545 --> 00:37:33.447

You know, we know that he'll bring you so many smiles in the future!

00:37:58.861 --> 00:38:00.805
Even more than he already has.

00:38:00.825 --> 00:38:02.568
Right!

00:38:02.588 --> 00:38:05.072

00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:20.461
Look at that!

00:38:21.002 --> 00:38:21.582
Beautiful!

00:38:21.602 --> 00:38:23.765
It looks like it could be like a postcard.

00:38:24.006 --> 00:38:28.191
It'll be really nice.

00:38:28.211 --> 00:38:32.137
I'd really love to have photos like this, like a bunch of postcards for Ruffians.

00:38:32.197 --> 00:38:33.499
Yeah!

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:33.879
That could be fun!

00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:38.225
We could make it into a postcard and then use it as fan mail!

00:38:38.245 --> 00:38:38.345
Yeah!

00:38:38.365 --> 00:38:39.106
You could send it to us!

00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:44.093
And then we could make a good special with it like a scrapbook or a collage catalogue.

00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:45.879
Scrapbook.

00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:54.589
Scrapbook.

00:38:55.565 --> 00:39:08.847
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:15.818
Have a howl of a day!

00:39:15.798 --> 00:39:22.411
This looks like such a nice motorbike ride.

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:24.936
In the morning too.

00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:27.461
Hopefully it wasn't too hot then.

00:39:27.501 --> 00:39:29.505
It's a copa hot.

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:29.766
Copa?

00:39:29.786 --> 00:39:31.950
I thought that was your bike's name.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.530
Hopefully it doesn't get too hot, but morning sounds like a good time for a bike ride.

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:43.377
Make sure you don't forget sunscreen or hydration though.

00:39:43.598 --> 00:39:45.141
I think you need more than just sunscreen.

00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:48.707
Lots of sun hat stuff.

00:39:48.727 --> 00:39:51.593
Can you wear a hat on a motorcycle?

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:52.431
Helmet.

00:39:52.752 --> 00:39:54.517
Wear the helmet.

00:39:54.757 --> 00:39:57.264
It'll protect your head more than your sunscreen.

00:39:57.404 --> 00:40:00.171
BAU BAU!

00:40:01.514 --> 00:40:02.316
Helmet, helmet.

00:40:02.356 --> 00:40:03.740
You're a Ruffian, you know.

00:40:04.582 --> 00:40:08.552
Obviously you can tell FUWAMOCO we don't really go on motorbikes or bikes.

00:40:09.292 --> 00:40:22.761
Morning.

00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:31.005
Next we have our Question of the Day!

00:40:31.446 --> 00:40:35.731
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:37.013
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:38.094
Here's my question.

00:40:38.414 --> 00:40:45.964
When you visit a new place, do you immediately take out your phone to snap photos, or do you prefer soaking it in with your own eyes?

00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:46.926
I'm the latter.

00:40:47.186 --> 00:40:49.811
I feel like I remember the experience better that way.

00:40:50.212 --> 00:40:51.795
Thank you for your answer!

00:40:51.815 --> 00:40:53.638
BAU BAU!

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.308
FUWAMOCO, you know we went to Taiwan to visit Sushiro Taiwan Store's YouTube videos.

00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:02.614
And we did take a lot of photos on our trip.

00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:05.860
But that's because we want to share it together with you Ruffians.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.883
Usually we don't take a lot of photos.

00:41:07.903 --> 00:41:09.325
I like to take them with my eyes.

00:41:10.026 --> 00:41:13.832
But I feel like if we do take photos, it's probably not all the normal stuff.

00:41:15.374 --> 00:41:20.141
I think we're also part of the team that likes to just enjoy the experience.

00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:23.867
You know, if it's a really special memory, then you'll remember it so vividly.

00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:25.970
But I do like to take a photo!

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.554
Just for memory's sake.

00:41:28.594 --> 00:41:30.817
But usually we forget.

00:41:31.618 --> 00:41:34.783
One photo a day would be nice, you know?

00:41:34.763 --> 00:41:38.712
BAU BAU!

00:41:38.953 --> 00:41:52.384
Thank you so much Ruffians for all your submissions!

00:41:52.364 --> 00:41:53.666
Remember, okay?

00:41:54.207 --> 00:41:57.833
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make together with you, okay?

00:41:57.853 --> 00:42:01.259
So, we're always looking for your doggy of the days.

00:42:01.279 --> 00:42:03.082
Your questions!

00:42:03.102 --> 00:42:04.805
You can ask us lots of questions.

00:42:04.825 --> 00:42:05.526
We are looking!

00:42:06.207 --> 00:42:07.510
Pero Sightings!

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.394
Maybe you'll see Pero at the Dodgers game.

00:42:11.056 --> 00:42:13.680
Or Saitama Super Arena!

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.327
Please share with us the hashtag!

00:42:19.347 --> 00:42:20.168
Hashtag!

00:42:20.188 --> 00:42:20.829

00:42:21.169 --> 00:42:22.350
BAU BAU!

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.055
Thank you Ruffians!

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.983
And we have a stream coming up!

00:42:33.003 --> 00:42:34.605
Yeah, our next stream!

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:37.549
De-den!

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.535
Our next Advent collab, we're gonna be playing V4!

00:42:41.935 --> 00:42:45.901
And this time, you know, it's on Wednesday at 6pm PDT.

00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:47.002
Thumbnail TBD.

00:42:47.082 --> 00:42:48.484
Thumbnail TBD!

00:42:48.985 --> 00:42:55.374
But, you know, there's been a big update, and even better than a big update, Nerissa's finally gonna be there!

00:42:55.434 --> 00:42:57.597
We can all play, all five of us!

00:42:57.717 --> 00:42:58.858
Yes, updated with Nerissa!

00:42:58.938 --> 00:43:00.120
Oh, this old thumbnail, yes.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.907
We're really looking forward to it!

00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:09.553
It'll be on Wednesday at 6pm PT, so we hope that you'll join us there, Ruffians!

00:43:10.495 --> 00:43:16.483
And in the meantime, we'll do our best, so... BAU BAU!

00:43:16.503 --> 00:43:22.632
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU BUTTERFLY!

00:43:22.612 --> 00:43:31.889
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:43.810
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:49.675
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:43:52.498 --> 00:43:59.985
