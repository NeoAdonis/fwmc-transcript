00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.100
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.418
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:20.883
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:23.324
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:23.564 --> 00:05:26.706
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:27.227
BAU BAU!

00:05:29.148 --> 00:05:32.251
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.293
Thank you for joining us for our 10th FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:34.344 --> 00:05:45.523
For our 10th FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:49.076
Can you believe it?

00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:49.861
Right!

00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.144
This is our 10th episode!

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:53.285
Right!

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:53.446
Amazing

00:05:53.402 --> 00:06:01.964
Well, for those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:03.404
Yeah, FUWAMOCO.

00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:05.165
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:11.006
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:16.168
Please make sure you tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:16.888 --> 00:06:17.088
Okay?

00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:22.169
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.470
BAU BAU!

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.771
Well, Ruffians, what do we have in store for today?

00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:35.792
We've heard from you directly that there's been another Pero Sighting.

00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:36.933
Another Pero Sighting.

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:39.033
Where is this one?

00:06:39.053 --> 00:06:39.433
De-den.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.514
Pero.

00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:41.994
Pero.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.846
He's in a beautiful open field.

00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:47.827
Look at the sky, Moco-chan.

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.447
It's a pretty nice sky.

00:06:49.507 --> 00:06:50.207
It's nice and blue.

00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:51.688
I like a good blue sky.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:57.769
Maybe Pero's just been craving some fresh open air and nature recently.

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.189
Yeah, I mean, does this count as nature?

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:01.249
There's not much trees.

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:07.991
True, but you know, I also kind of get a bit of a nostalgic feeling looking at a tree, you know?

00:07:09.432 --> 00:07:11.074
Maybe it feels a bit personal.

00:07:13.096 --> 00:07:16.080
Like a personal computer, maybe?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.625
It has a computer feeling to it.

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:21.667
It's kind of unsettling, though.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.191
It doesn't look very natural.

00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:25.924
Pero!

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.606
We're gonna find you!

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:30.448
We're gonna find you!

00:07:30.468 --> 00:07:31.609
We'll get you!

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.730
Scary when you say it like that, Moco-chan.

00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:34.851
Ruffians!

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:37.133
Ruffians, you'll help us find him, okay?

00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:37.733
Right?

00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:38.714
Right?

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.235
I don't know, you know.

00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:44.598
Tomorrow we're gonna go to the back rooms, right?

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.080
Maybe there's some computers in the back rooms.

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:50.683
I don't think I want that.

00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:55.245
I hope the back room looks more like this.

00:07:55.425 --> 00:08:00.728
Hopefully he's still there since we're gonna go and try to find him.

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:06.151
Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more sightings.

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:08.133
Use the hashtag, okay?

00:08:08.293 --> 00:08:10.894
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:17.924
But to be honest though, I am kind of worried that we aren't going to be able to find him in the back room.

00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:19.804
He should still be there.

00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:20.845
Right.

00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:22.345
It's his new house.

00:08:22.645 --> 00:08:24.266
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:26.827
How did he get inside the windows?

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:27.647
I'm not sure.

00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:28.607
We don't know.

00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:30.988
He just... He sent us a photo, you know.

00:08:31.008 --> 00:08:33.969
Maybe if we find him, we can ask him.

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.870
It's an idea.

00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:39.912
Let's do it, okay, Ruffians?

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:52.607
Well, Ruffians, you might already know, but just in the past few days, there's been something extra special that happened.

00:08:54.796 --> 00:08:56.137
De-den!

00:08:56.738 --> 00:09:04.283
It was a very very special Precious Senpai Council's second anniversary!

00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:07.045
I drew a special drawing of them.

00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:08.006
Right?

00:09:08.066 --> 00:09:10.588
His cute Moco-chan looks just like them.

00:09:10.628 --> 00:09:13.470
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.314
Well, we wanted to wish them a very happy second anniversary!

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:27.397
We can't believe that it's already been two years.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.941
Right?

00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:32.128
Ruffians, does it feel like it's been two years?

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:38.200
Well, you know, there's been a lot of funny moments, and so many good memories, yeah.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.821
Good memories made along the way.

00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:41.502
And the cake!

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.645
Ruffians, you saw the cake the council made all together, right?

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:46.066
It looks so good!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.868
But my cake looks better, right?

00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:48.428
Does it?

00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:49.309
It's bigger!

00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:49.889
It's bigger!

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.570
It's bigger!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.611
That's for sure, it's bigger.

00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:53.472
You need a big cake for four people.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.995
Well, you know, and then...

00:10:00.118 --> 00:10:02.019
They also announced the 3D showcases!

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:06.361
We're looking forward to it so much!

00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.022
We know just how hard Senpai has been working to prepare for them.

00:10:10.183 --> 00:10:12.504
I'm looking forward to it.

00:10:12.984 --> 00:10:16.505
Ruffians, you better look forward to it too!

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:20.227
Let's all have fun, okay?

00:10:20.547 --> 00:10:24.829
We hope we can get to know them a bit more closely soon after too.

00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:26.530
Make more memories all together.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.332
Happy Anniversary, Cats!

00:10:29.372 --> 00:10:31.794
BAU BAU!

00:10:34.177 --> 00:10:34.817
And!

00:10:35.578 --> 00:10:36.579
In case you didn't know.

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:39.042
There's something we wanted to remind you.

00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:39.382
Yeah!

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:40.543
Reminder!

00:10:40.824 --> 00:10:41.745
Very important.

00:10:42.532 --> 00:10:42.892
Advent!

00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:43.953
Advent!

00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:49.018
It's almost been a month since we debuted.

00:10:49.178 --> 00:10:56.524
And to mark our debut as members of hololive, you know, there's been some special debut celebration merchandise.

00:10:57.045 --> 00:10:58.166
You didn't forget, right?

00:10:58.226 --> 00:10:58.666
Right!

00:10:59.047 --> 00:11:01.248
Right, I know it's already been almost a month.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:07.714
But yes, the window for pre-orders is going to be coming to a close very soon.

00:11:08.014 --> 00:11:08.775
On the 4th.

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:09.856
September 4th.

00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:12.798
Make sure you don't forget, okay?

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:16.021
Because this will be the only time you can get them.

00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:21.285
And you know, I know it can be a bit frustrating.

00:11:21.646 --> 00:11:23.267
A bit like, ah!

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.749
I want them in my paws right now!

00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:29.132
It can take some time, but it's well worth the wait.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.281
And you know, they're limited.

00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:37.144
You might never be able to get them again, so... It's just Extra Special, right?

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:43.609
And this way, you know, you'll be like, well, I was with  from the start, at the very, the very start of the journeys, right?

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:49.813
So... Extra Special!

00:11:49.913 --> 00:11:52.595
We hope that you check them out if you haven't yet!

00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:58.859
And actually, you haven't been able to have a peek yet, but we had a bit of a peek at the sample.

00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:05.807
They create like magnets too.

00:12:06.647 --> 00:12:09.487
You know sometimes like magnets will fall off the fridge and then they break?

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:11.388
Not the type.

00:12:11.568 --> 00:12:12.068
Not the type.

00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:12.588
No.

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:22.930
And I was thinking, you know, like, Moco-chan, I can hold up maybe one side of a Ruffian's photo and then you can hold the other one up and we can like, teamwork it!

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.470
Right?

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.130
Magnets.

00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:26.531
Yeah!

00:12:27.051 --> 00:12:30.092
Also there's the stained glass kitchen there you just saw.

00:12:30.352 --> 00:12:32.032
I was thinking, you know, for maybe

00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:37.956
Maybe Ruffians are a bit more fashionable into the aesthetic things.

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:39.257
You could hang it off your nose.

00:12:39.858 --> 00:12:40.358
You could.

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:44.141
Or you know, maybe you want to show your love for Advent on a boat.

00:12:44.822 --> 00:12:47.364
But you're maybe a little shy too, you could put it on your bike.

00:12:47.384 --> 00:12:47.604
Ah, choo!

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:47.904
Right.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:49.786
Yeah?

00:12:49.846 --> 00:12:50.146
Yeah?

00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:54.769
And then there's also the acrylic stands too!

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:57.751
Ruffians, do you know what you're gonna do with them yet?

00:12:58.071 --> 00:12:59.032
Where you're gonna place them?

00:12:59.092 --> 00:13:00.393
How you're gonna use them?

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:03.054
There's lots of different ways to arrange acrylic stands.

00:13:04.696 --> 00:13:07.895
I'm always so interested in seeing... I wanna see it!

00:13:08.378 --> 00:13:09.364
I wanna see it!

00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:25.557
We're looking forward to it.

00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:29.242
Maybe Ruffians, you can take photos afterwards and share it with us.

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:30.404
I'm curious.

00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:31.405
Stick us on a journey.

00:13:31.425 --> 00:13:34.189
We can go on a walk together!

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.792
I'll wear them like earrings.

00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.322
That was very creative.

00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:42.785
Please check them out!

00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:43.686
Thank you!

00:13:44.227 --> 00:13:48.470
Well, you know, we especially wanted to remind you about the merch.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.533
But that's because we really like merch, too.

00:13:52.793 --> 00:13:57.397
And I know we haven't really talked about it much before, but I sort of wanted to talk about it.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.341
There's one thing that we both really, really like.

00:14:02.361 --> 00:14:03.742
Well, we like a lot of different kinds of merch.

00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:04.983
Yeah, we like a lot of stuff.

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:06.745
Especially, especially this.

00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:10.978
We really like figures and garage kits.

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:14.101
There might be some Ruffians that don't know what garage kits are, so we'll explain that.

00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:15.102
But figures.

00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:16.062
Scale figures.

00:14:16.082 --> 00:14:18.504
Particularly we like scale figures.

00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:28.512
At one point, we had well over a hundred of them, but, you know... Things happen when we're in the cell and they're...

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.441
Somewhere out there.

00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:32.362
But our favorite figure scales are 1-7 scale and above.

00:14:32.382 --> 00:14:36.245
But I feel like larger figures are just getting more popular recently.

00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:51.278
But there's way too many super cute figures nowadays.

00:14:51.378 --> 00:14:53.138
It's just really, really dangerous.

00:14:53.178 --> 00:14:54.319
Dangerous, dangerous.

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.279
But I think we're good at avoiding temptation.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.920
Just look.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.280
Right?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.720
Just look.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.361
Avoid it.

00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:04.221
Ruffians, do you like figures?

00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:07.902
Do you have figures?

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:08.622
One for scale!

00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:09.962
One for scale!

00:15:10.323 --> 00:15:11.623
One for scale!

00:15:11.983 --> 00:15:13.103
That's when it's serious.

00:15:13.463 --> 00:15:14.784
Serious business.

00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:20.158
It's not an addiction.

00:15:20.238 --> 00:15:22.459
100 figures is completely reasonable, okay?

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:23.559
You do.

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:30.143
If you love them all equally, then... Well, I think there might be some more that you like more than others.

00:15:30.303 --> 00:15:33.244
But my favorite sculptor is Morikawa Hiromitsu.

00:15:33.524 --> 00:15:37.526
But they don't really do many figures anymore nowadays.

00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:44.730
But I just really like them because they're really good with round faces and capturing the character's personality through their simple but cute poses.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.991
I like...

00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:47.432
I think simple is good.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:53.675
You know, once I really capture the character's personality, it brings them to life.

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:57.556
You guys have been in storage for a long time.

00:15:59.477 --> 00:15:59.937
It's tough.

00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:01.098
It's tough, you know?

00:16:01.118 --> 00:16:01.859
Toshindai!

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:04.360
Wait, not Ohesou.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.082
Just Toshindai.

00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:11.104
The full life-size Toshindai.

00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:12.545
Very, very good.

00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:13.686
That's made of dreams.

00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:17.508
I think there's a lot of Ruffians maybe that might wonder like...

00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:20.629
Oh, but one of these figures is good because they just sit there.

00:16:21.409 --> 00:16:22.310
No, no.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.850
That's what makes them so good.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.610
They sit there.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.611
They're just happy.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.992
You can look at them from every kind of angle.

00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:28.552
They're beautiful.

00:16:28.572 --> 00:16:28.812
Beautiful.

00:16:28.932 --> 00:16:29.452
Admire them.

00:16:29.512 --> 00:16:29.972
Yeah.

00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:32.553
You know, they're always smiling back at you.

00:16:33.073 --> 00:16:36.995
You can see from all different, like maybe close up, maybe from far away.

00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:39.476
Maybe in bright light, maybe in dark light.

00:16:39.976 --> 00:16:43.377
You know, in the sunshine from the morning.

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:45.358
Or the sunset, you know.

00:16:45.518 --> 00:16:45.938
It's great.

00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:50.247
I'm seeing a comment that I do not agree with.

00:16:50.347 --> 00:16:51.208
Kind of creepy.

00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:52.088
No!

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:53.829
No!

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.190
It's beautiful.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.492
It's artwork.

00:16:58.632 --> 00:17:01.274
And it stays forever and ever.

00:17:03.015 --> 00:17:04.096
We also really really like...

00:17:04.696 --> 00:17:07.917
Pink Cadillac and Bome for the garage kits.

00:17:07.997 --> 00:17:09.258
So garage kits!

00:17:09.398 --> 00:17:11.899
They're like figures that you have to assemble and paint yourself.

00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:13.519
But usually resin.

00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:14.499
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:16.500
We've never built a kit before.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.842
But I really, really admire people that can build kits.

00:17:21.262 --> 00:17:28.384
It seems really intimidating having to pin all the parts together and sand and airbrush and all this stuff.

00:17:28.544 --> 00:17:28.824
Yeah.

00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:31.806
And then it's like, what if you make a little mistake?

00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:32.686
Yeah.

00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:38.195
Having to repaint it again is very, very amazing.

00:17:39.957 --> 00:17:41.898
But I think it's something that we'd like to do one day.

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:45.201
When we're very, very, very old guard dogs.

00:17:46.262 --> 00:17:49.365
Hopefully we'll still have very good vision then, Moco-chan, right?

00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:50.586
I didn't think about that.

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:54.029
Hopefully we'll have very nimble fingers too.

00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:59.533
And hopefully the resin will still hold up then too.

00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:04.696
Another hope is maybe Moco-chan, one day we can become figures too.

00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:09.659
And then that way we can be with you Ruffians wherever you go!

00:18:09.939 --> 00:18:12.781
Watch you all the time!

00:18:13.521 --> 00:18:13.801
Right?

00:18:13.961 --> 00:18:15.502
Even when you don't realize it.

00:18:15.602 --> 00:18:18.384
I'll watch you when you sleep!

00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:19.885
Yeah!

00:18:20.505 --> 00:18:21.786
Wish you like that!

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:28.616
Yes!

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:29.637
Not creepy!

00:18:29.657 --> 00:18:31.297
It's not creepy!

00:18:31.597 --> 00:18:33.638
Totally normal.

00:18:33.798 --> 00:18:37.620
I don't forget.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:45.222
If you don't have a figure yet, one day.

00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:51.705
Can you promise that your first figure is going to be FUWAMOCO?

00:18:53.564 --> 00:18:54.905
I think it's a good suggestion.

00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:55.245
Yes!

00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:56.705
A good suggestion.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.147
Oh, one, one Pero figure.

00:19:00.247 --> 00:19:02.388
I would like that.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:03.888
It won't be very soft.

00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:04.909
It won't be.

00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:05.569
That's okay.

00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:08.910
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.751
Okay, it's a promise then.

00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:11.471
A promise.

00:19:11.531 --> 00:19:12.032
A promise.

00:19:12.472 --> 00:19:13.072
Okay.

00:19:13.732 --> 00:19:13.812
And...

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:23.926
I think it's time for the Ruffians' favorite part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.868
De-den!

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:34.994
And for today, it's... De-den!

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.337
Actually, Moco-chan, actually!

00:19:38.557 --> 00:19:41.539
There's something that I wanted to clear up.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.361
Ruffians!

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.680
Ruffians!

00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:48.222
I have something important to say.

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:52.104
Oh, this?

00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:58.948
Yeah.

00:19:59.028 --> 00:19:59.748
Ruffians!

00:20:00.228 --> 00:20:06.111
You know, sometimes Moco-chan, you ask for praise from the Ruffians, right?

00:20:06.492 --> 00:20:10.994
You know, like, praise me or, you know, am I cute?

00:20:11.014 --> 00:20:12.895
Or, can I get head pads?

00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:14.196
Those kind of things, right?

00:20:16.397 --> 00:20:20.378
Recently it's been more and more and more.

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:23.219
I don't know about that.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.621
It's not like it's been a problem or anything, but... Are you sure?

00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:28.321
It sure sounds like it's a problem.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.922
You haven't been bothered by Moco-chan, right?

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:32.583
Am I just a bother?

00:20:32.603 --> 00:20:33.103
Huh?

00:20:33.943 --> 00:20:34.804
Huh, Ruffians?

00:20:35.604 --> 00:20:35.904
Right?

00:20:36.484 --> 00:20:41.506
But, but, but... I know... I know...

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:50.536
Moco-chan, you know, she's my little sister, and I need to be like a stronger, older sister for her, right?

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:52.857
You know, like a good role model!

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:52.977
Right?

00:20:54.037 --> 00:20:54.577
Yeah.

00:20:55.418 --> 00:21:09.984
So, I've let her be a little bit more needy from you Ruffians, but... I wanted to say that... that Fuwawa likes to be praised too.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.262
You know, I've been trying to be strong, you know, and I've been trying to put on a brave face too.

00:21:18.342 --> 00:21:26.044
And Moco-chan is needy because I have to be the older sister, but I like to be praised by the Ruffians too, so... Me too.

00:21:26.844 --> 00:21:28.485
Don't forget about me, okay?

00:21:29.405 --> 00:21:29.845
Okay.

00:21:32.186 --> 00:21:32.706
That's all.

00:21:34.557 --> 00:21:35.217
I'm Mococo.

00:21:35.838 --> 00:21:36.118
Huh?

00:21:36.658 --> 00:21:37.479
Oh, I'm Mococo.

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:38.600
Moco-chan.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.221
You're good.

00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:42.963
You got a lot of hepatoplasm, you know.

00:21:45.084 --> 00:21:47.345
You should try to be a bit more like your older sister.

00:21:48.986 --> 00:21:49.307
Right.

00:21:49.527 --> 00:21:49.807
What?

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:50.628
What?

00:21:51.148 --> 00:21:51.468
What?

00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:51.948
What?

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:53.369
I'm Mococo!

00:21:59.571 --> 00:22:00.752
No misunderstandings today.

00:22:00.773 --> 00:22:02.334
Ruffians, you understand right.

00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:03.876
No misunderstandings today.

00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:04.877
Understand my feelings?

00:22:06.439 --> 00:22:07.660
Next!

00:22:09.522 --> 00:22:10.203
Thanks, Moco-chan.

00:22:10.223 --> 00:22:15.148
Thanks for giving me that special moment to clear up the misunderstanding.

00:22:15.329 --> 00:22:16.129
You're welcome!

00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:18.026
Wow!

00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:23.368
Today's the 10th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:23.408 --> 00:22:24.769
We didn't give you much time there.

00:22:25.689 --> 00:22:31.111
We wanted to ask something extra special for a musically talented Ruffians.

00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:37.814
We're looking for a musical jingle for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:22:39.455 --> 00:22:40.295
You know, um...

00:22:41.573 --> 00:22:45.939
It's nothing, you say special, but it's nothing too special.

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:48.923
It's something, you know, quick and simple.

00:22:49.404 --> 00:22:50.886
Something less than 10 seconds.

00:22:50.926 --> 00:22:51.927
Less than 10 seconds.

00:22:51.947 --> 00:22:54.110
It could be like a BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.313
Or like a BAUI!

00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:09.397
You know, but we'd like to ask, you know, that it's completely original, like an original melody, and that you don't use any copyrighted sounds or voice clips in it.

00:23:09.517 --> 00:23:14.139
But like, if you wanted to use Moco-chan's squeaky BAU BAU just now, you could.

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.419
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:16.760
You know...

00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:22.022
It's something that just says, FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:23:22.142 --> 00:23:23.763
Yeah, yeah, whenever you feel like that.

00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:24.603
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:23:24.663 --> 00:23:26.304
And then we'll be like, Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:23:26.444 --> 00:23:28.165
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:28.705
Yeah.

00:23:28.945 --> 00:23:33.607
I think we have different ideas, Moco-chan, but that's okay!

00:23:33.847 --> 00:23:34.447
That's fine!

00:23:34.527 --> 00:23:36.028
I wanna know what the Ruffians think.

00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:37.508
I wanna know from you!

00:23:37.748 --> 00:23:38.669
Yeah!

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:42.150
You can submit it on Twitter with the hashtag #FWMCJINGLE.

00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:52.873
If you'd like to ask for it in either a WAVE or MP3 format, and if you're a bit confused, you can always link it to a Google Drive.

00:23:53.853 --> 00:23:56.213
The submission deadline is rather soon.

00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:58.614
It's September 3rd.

00:23:59.154 --> 00:24:00.954
Hopefully that'll be okay, Ruffians.

00:24:01.054 --> 00:24:01.734
It's 10 seconds.

00:24:01.994 --> 00:24:02.594
Less than 10 seconds.

00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:03.995
Yeah, less than 10 seconds.

00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:06.095
Not have to be 10 seconds, less than 10 seconds.

00:24:06.115 --> 00:24:07.215
2 seconds, 3 seconds.

00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:08.975
That's all good too, you know?

00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:10.196
Less than 10 seconds.

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:11.316
No pressure.

00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:18.805
You know something that is like, ah, I listened to this and it's another FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.047
That kind of feeling.

00:24:20.087 --> 00:24:21.809
Yeah, that feel, you know?

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.935
You know we can start off the new day something cute.

00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.938
That kind of thing.

00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:31.640
Energy.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.421
Not heavy.

00:24:33.182 --> 00:24:41.853
We're really really looking forward to growing FUWAMOCO Morning into something even bigger all together with you Ruffians.

00:24:42.434 --> 00:24:43.375
No pressure.

00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:46.038
No pressure, no pressure.

00:24:46.458 --> 00:24:50.261
I don't know so much of the ooze ooze thing that Moco-chan's thinking of.

00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:54.224
I don't know, maybe that's some Ruffians idea.

00:24:54.264 --> 00:24:57.306
Don't give them ideas, let them think on their own.

00:24:57.667 --> 00:24:59.368
You're the one who started it, Moco-chan.

00:24:59.428 --> 00:24:59.808
What?

00:24:59.828 --> 00:25:01.590
I didn't start anything.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.731
You did, you did.

00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:02.971
No?

00:25:03.872 --> 00:25:07.174
Ruffians!

00:25:11.452 --> 00:25:12.574
Do you recognize these?

00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:14.357
Do you recognize that?

00:25:14.377 --> 00:25:16.140
These question marks.

00:25:17.162 --> 00:25:18.424
You saw them recently.

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.371
Well, you don't!

00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:25.690
We took a look at our schedule.

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:31.217
We have our 500k Ruffians on YouTube celebration!

00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:34.281
We're gonna have a really big party this weekend.

00:25:34.842 --> 00:25:38.406
But you noticed the question, question, question mark beside it, right?

00:25:39.328 --> 00:25:39.688
Right.

00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:41.310
I think some Ruffians did.

00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:46.356
Do you have any ideas what that could be?

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:48.358
It's not a B-A-U.

00:25:48.398 --> 00:25:49.138
It's not a BAU.

00:25:49.479 --> 00:25:49.639
No.

00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:55.565
But the BAU BAU is always included.

00:25:55.585 --> 00:25:57.547
Yeah.

00:25:57.747 --> 00:25:58.688
Not pizza.

00:25:59.009 --> 00:25:59.929
Not pizza.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.870
Not pizza.

00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:02.772
Pizza's how many letters?

00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:03.941
Four?

00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:05.021
Five?

00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:06.222
Five letters?

00:26:06.902 --> 00:26:07.062
No.

00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:08.802
That doesn't make sense.

00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:09.342
It doesn't.

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:13.703
Ruffians, do you wanna know?

00:26:13.783 --> 00:26:17.084
Do you wanna know?

00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:20.165
You'll be at the celebration regardless of what it is, right?

00:26:20.365 --> 00:26:20.785
Right!

00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:21.405
Right.

00:26:21.985 --> 00:26:22.405
Right.

00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:28.367
I thought we let you know now!

00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:29.447
De-den!

00:26:31.838 --> 00:26:35.265
We're gonna be opening memberships!

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:37.410
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:39.835
It's happening, Ruffians!

00:26:41.717 --> 00:26:49.562
We're opening our memberships, doing our 500k celebration.

00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:52.985
Ruffians, we hope that you'll be there with us!

00:26:53.065 --> 00:26:58.689
We're really really looking forward to spending more time together and trying lots of different things with the membership too.

00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:01.791
We thought it'd be a good time to open it.

00:27:01.811 --> 00:27:04.033
Make a big big celebration.

00:27:04.453 --> 00:27:06.314
Extra celebratory celebration.

00:27:06.534 --> 00:27:08.736
You know,

00:27:09.537 --> 00:27:15.513
But we're really looking forward to making a membership somewhere like really fun and comfy too.

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:16.215
Fun and comfy.

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:21.925
We hope that you'll think of joining membership during our celebration day.

00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:23.125
Membership party!

00:27:23.165 --> 00:27:24.266
Membership!

00:27:24.326 --> 00:27:25.866
Yeah, BAU BAU.

00:27:25.906 --> 00:27:27.947
Can't spell membership without the BAU.

00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:34.630
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.410
Let's have lots of fun, okay?

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.431
Don't miss it.

00:27:37.871 --> 00:27:39.372
Okay?

00:27:40.052 --> 00:27:42.573
BAU BAU!

00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:45.394
We'll go on to our regular segments today.

00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:50.857
The Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:27:52.518 --> 00:27:53.038
It's Chester!

00:27:53.058 --> 00:27:53.739
Chester!

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:54.819
So cute!

00:27:55.099 --> 00:27:58.281
Chester likes sleeping, chasing cats and bunnies.

00:27:58.341 --> 00:27:59.222
We sound sort of similar, huh?

00:27:59.242 --> 00:28:03.784
Now that you know I'm watching FUWAMOCO Morning, we're sort of similar.

00:28:03.804 --> 00:28:09.027
I was gonna say, he sounds like a doggy that we become the best of friends with.

00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:11.309
Especially because he doesn't like scary things either.

00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:13.450
We are gonna be buddies.

00:28:14.511 --> 00:28:19.036
I like to think you know that maybe Chester has like a very strong sixth sense.

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:25.281
You know, like if he senses me... I don't know about you, but like if he senses something there, like he's gone.

00:28:25.702 --> 00:28:26.483
He's out of there.

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:30.186
No, I'm a tough... tough... I'm tough, yes.

00:28:31.667 --> 00:28:33.289
Moco-chan's not the type to run away.

00:28:33.349 --> 00:28:34.530
I would never run away, right?

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.711
Never ever ever.

00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:37.353
I was saying though, like...

00:28:38.163 --> 00:28:41.766
Some people might not think, you know, a guard dog is good if it guards you.

00:28:42.286 --> 00:28:45.409
But if it runs away, then you know to run with it.

00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:48.031
Safety alarm dog.

00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:51.173
You can run all the way together as fast as you can.

00:28:51.193 --> 00:28:52.995
I think that's good.

00:28:53.115 --> 00:28:54.436
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:28:56.037 --> 00:28:57.118
Safety in another way.

00:28:58.619 --> 00:28:59.520
A different kind of guard dog.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.641
You shouldn't have thought, Biboo!

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.394
No, this is Chester.

00:29:04.554 --> 00:29:06.475
I don't know if Biboo's quite that cute.

00:29:10.656 --> 00:29:11.136
Oh no.

00:29:11.556 --> 00:29:14.636
Biboo's gonna walk us if we're not careful.

00:29:14.696 --> 00:29:15.397
I said nothing.

00:29:16.617 --> 00:29:18.597
Well, how does Chester go?

00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:23.318
I kind of feel like maybe Chester has a very good, solid voice.

00:29:23.618 --> 00:29:26.999
But it's maybe kind of typical, like a BAU BAU.

00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:27.619
BAU BAU.

00:29:28.659 --> 00:29:29.820
A typical BAU BAU.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.400
BAU BAU.

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:33.419
BAU BAU!

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.910
Thank you, BAU BAU!

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.371
I love Biboo too.

00:30:00.411 --> 00:30:02.433
Biboo is cute.

00:30:02.513 --> 00:30:07.276
Just maybe not as much as Chester.

00:30:07.636 --> 00:30:10.898
Today, I went on a walk.

00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:13.280
What kind of walk did we go on today?

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.700
De-den!

00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.142
It's kind of like the winter.

00:30:18.182 --> 00:30:18.442
What?

00:30:19.062 --> 00:30:21.783
It's just a bit different.

00:30:22.063 --> 00:30:24.263
It's like where Pero is.

00:30:24.443 --> 00:30:24.863
Right!

00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:27.104
A bit similar.

00:30:27.804 --> 00:30:28.744
This is Britain!

00:30:28.944 --> 00:30:30.824
Britain!

00:30:30.844 --> 00:30:33.605
There's a skate well too.

00:30:33.825 --> 00:30:35.145
That's fun.

00:30:36.366 --> 00:30:38.526
And traditional fish and chip shop.

00:30:39.386 --> 00:30:40.386
The park was fun.

00:30:40.587 --> 00:30:41.587
Extra Ruffian.

00:30:41.687 --> 00:30:42.207
I don't know.

00:30:43.433 --> 00:30:45.654
Dangerous Park.

00:30:46.314 --> 00:30:48.735
But, FUWAMOCO, the skate park.

00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:50.256
Skateboarding!

00:30:51.837 --> 00:30:54.438
We've never tried it before.

00:30:54.498 --> 00:30:55.598
Can you imagine?

00:30:56.018 --> 00:31:01.681
I go on it and I go... And then I would faceplant.

00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:04.602
Yeah, we do it best just on bicycles.

00:31:04.782 --> 00:31:07.503
But, even then, that's kind of questionable.

00:31:07.723 --> 00:31:08.564
It's questionable.

00:31:10.004 --> 00:31:11.125
Ruffians, I think you know

00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:16.748
You well know that we're very afraid of anything scary, like heights.

00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:17.988
No, we're not!

00:31:18.008 --> 00:31:19.329
We're good, we're good, we're good!

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:22.390
So skateboarding, it's not really our thing.

00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:29.114
Maybe, you know, there's the vroom vroom vroom of the wheels on the ground, you know?

00:31:29.946 --> 00:31:33.427
Can you take responsibility for catching us when we fall?

00:31:52.938 --> 00:31:55.059
I don't know if we can get the Ruffians though.

00:31:55.379 --> 00:31:56.999
Oh, Ruffians are toffians!

00:31:57.019 --> 00:32:00.420
That makes sense, I guess.

00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:09.123
I was gonna say Ruffians though, you're probably more coordinated than us, so if you want to try skateboarding, please do it.

00:32:09.903 --> 00:32:10.543
Try it!

00:32:10.703 --> 00:32:11.864
Try it for us.

00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:13.204
Fun things are fun.

00:32:14.004 --> 00:32:17.065
As long as you don't get hurt.

00:32:17.225 --> 00:32:18.786
As long as you don't bite us if we catch you.

00:32:20.262 --> 00:32:22.223
As long as you catch us like a normal person.

00:32:22.444 --> 00:32:24.205
Catch us like a normal person, you know.

00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:27.167
No promises!

00:32:28.828 --> 00:32:30.889
A Question of the Day.

00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:32.090
De-den!

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.692
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:32:34.772 --> 00:32:35.732
Hello!

00:32:36.113 --> 00:32:42.477
I'm a bit of a perfectionist and it leaves me feeling dejected and frustrated when I don't do things up to my mental standard.

00:32:42.817 --> 00:32:46.099
And it's a lot harsher when it comes to creative ventures.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.740
Do you two experience that?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.221
Do you have any advice?

00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:51.324
We understand.

00:32:51.384 --> 00:32:55.069
Yeah, we used to be really, really bad perfectionists.

00:32:55.991 --> 00:32:58.074
So yeah, we know it can be hard.

00:32:58.094 --> 00:32:59.716
Ruffians, you too!

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:01.416
BAU BAU!

00:33:31.697 --> 00:33:32.638
It's not going to be anything.

00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:34.239
It's no good.

00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:36.882
Because you can't expect everything to be perfect, you know?

00:33:38.903 --> 00:33:42.427
Sometimes it's not going to be as you like it.

00:33:42.847 --> 00:33:43.808
And that's just normal.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.070
You just have to keep on trying.

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.672
Make stuff you don't make.

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:50.153
Perfect is the enemy of good, right?

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:12.067
And it's really... It's frustrating!

00:34:12.247 --> 00:34:13.148
It makes me mad!

00:34:13.588 --> 00:34:14.728
Like, why did I do that?

00:34:14.768 --> 00:34:16.009
That was a waste of time.

00:34:16.029 --> 00:34:17.129
We didn't need to do that.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.050
Exactly.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.851
So, just be... Just do your best.

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:20.791
Be you.

00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:22.912
Nobody is perfect.

00:34:23.052 --> 00:34:28.275
And like, you know, Moco-chan said, perfect is boring, you know?

00:34:28.955 --> 00:34:34.658
And I think that it can be fun to not be perfect.

00:34:35.158 --> 00:34:37.219
So, look forward to some...

00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:49.135
Well, we'll talk a bit more about that, but Ruffians are always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day vlogs, and for some more questions.

00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:53.717
I think there's maybe been a couple questions about where the questions should be going.

00:34:53.737 --> 00:35:02.341
For FUWAMOCO Morning, if you have any submissions for FUWAMOCO Morning or questions, please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:06.082
If you think this could be a FUWAMOCO Morning, that's where you go.

00:35:06.783 --> 00:35:06.963
Yeah.

00:35:07.663 --> 00:35:08.083
Thank you.

00:35:08.123 --> 00:35:10.124
I'm sorry that was a bit confusing.

00:35:10.184 --> 00:35:11.105
That was our fault.

00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:13.366
We'll try to have it less confusing.

00:35:14.306 --> 00:35:15.527
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.888
As for our next stream... De-den!

00:35:19.268 --> 00:35:22.770
We're going to be playing Little Witch Nobeta once more!

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.910
It's been quite a while.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.511
Well, we're after that too, but again!

00:35:26.531 --> 00:35:27.092
Again!

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:27.712
Again.

00:35:27.772 --> 00:35:36.716
You know, it's been a little while since the last one, but I was really impressed, Moco-chan, because I think compared to the beginning, you really improved.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.800
And there's only a little bit of time.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.001
Only a little bit.

00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:40.981
Only a little more.

00:35:41.601 --> 00:35:44.682
To be honest though, I'm glad I don't have to touch the keys.

00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:47.643
It looks really difficult.

00:35:47.663 --> 00:35:48.283
It's lazy.

00:35:48.423 --> 00:35:49.564
No, it's not lazy.

00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:50.844
It looks difficult.

00:35:51.284 --> 00:35:54.045
I think it's lazy.

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:57.066
Instead though, I'll just, I'll enjoy the journey.

00:35:57.566 --> 00:36:00.187
And you know, I'll tell Moco-chan what to do when she needs me to.

00:36:02.965 --> 00:36:03.825
Yeah.

00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:04.266
Okay.

00:36:04.686 --> 00:36:07.728
Let's have lots of FUWAMOCO-yans!

00:36:07.948 --> 00:36:09.368
Our schedule!

00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:11.250
Again!

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.151
We have a 500k celebration!

00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:17.513
And our memberships are opening too!

00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:18.674
Membership!

00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:19.434
I can't wait.

00:36:19.915 --> 00:36:24.617
But you know, there's also the Extra Rare Rock n' Rawr Party.

00:36:24.637 --> 00:36:25.017
Yeah.

00:36:25.178 --> 00:36:27.039
This time it's an archive, you know.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:28.980
And we've been a bit secretive.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.780
Secretive, maybe.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.821
About what makes it so

00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:32.802
Extra Special.

00:36:33.022 --> 00:36:37.866
But, Ruffians, I think you know well, too, that we really like Japanese music.

00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:38.367
Right!

00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:40.868
And we know Japanese music.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:49.975
But this time, we're gonna be challenging ourselves to sing a lot more of the popular hit songs from Western music.

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:52.197
Yeah.

00:36:53.938 --> 00:36:54.559
Yeah.

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:59.523
So, expect... tummy hurt.

00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:05.828
Yeah, it's gonna be something else.

00:37:06.088 --> 00:37:11.174
Not to say there won't be any Japanese songs, but... We're gonna be laughing.

00:37:11.214 --> 00:37:13.136
Yeah, be ready to laugh, okay?

00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:13.276
Yeah.

00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:17.804
It'll be interesting.

00:37:17.824 --> 00:37:20.345
A very very different Rock n' Rawr Party.

00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:26.908
Yeah, we don't know how many of these different Rock n' Rawr Parties there's gonna be, but it'll be very different!

00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:28.269
BAU BAU!

00:37:29.129 --> 00:37:31.631
Thank you!

00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:35.433
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 10th FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:37:40.669 --> 00:37:45.073
I can't believe technically it's the 11th because there was a pilot episode, but it's the 10th episode.

00:37:45.093 --> 00:37:51.979
Thank you Ruffians, thank you for joining us for the 10th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:37:52.379 --> 00:37:58.765
And we know there's going to be a lot more special episodes to come, especially with maybe a brand new jingle too.

00:38:00.487 --> 00:38:06.972
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:38:08.113 --> 00:38:08.794
Everly!

00:38:09.095 --> 00:38:10.837
BAU BAU!

00:38:10.858 --> 00:38:11.498

00:38:14.823 --> 00:38:15.224

00:38:15.284 --> 00:38:16.966
BAU BAU!

00:38:16.987 --> 00:38:17.868

00:38:18.128 --> 00:38:19.290
BAU BAU!

00:38:23.916 --> 00:38:32.438
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:38:32.478 --> 00:38:34.179
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
