05:07.841 --> 05:09.942
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:10.382 --> 05:14.023
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.143 --> 05:18.065
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.105 --> 05:20.346
BAU BAU!

05:20.966 --> 05:23.887
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.628 --> 05:27.209
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.249 --> 05:29.229
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.269 --> 05:30.430
BAU BAU!

05:35.118 --> 05:37.039
Good morning!

05:37.880 --> 05:46.985
Just in case you weren't aware, today Ruffians, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:47.045 --> 05:49.606
Thank you for joining us for our 46th episode!

05:49.646 --> 05:50.467
BAU BAU!

05:55.289 --> 06:04.593
Wow, for Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:04.794 --> 06:05.294
A.K.A.

06:05.354 --> 06:06.294
FUWAMOCO!

06:06.835 --> 06:10.236
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:10.316 --> 06:10.596
What?

06:11.197 --> 06:13.858
Mococo, you kinda took a big breath there, didn't you?

06:14.438 --> 06:16.039
I was on time, you were not.

06:18.360 --> 06:24.982
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:25.082 --> 06:30.264
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING.

06:31.065 --> 06:35.046
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:35.206 --> 06:37.827
BAU BAU!

06:38.968 --> 06:42.569
A brand new week, a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:44.090 --> 06:44.390
Well,

06:45.481 --> 06:47.642
Has there been another Pero Sighting?

06:47.782 --> 06:48.262
I don't know.

06:49.562 --> 06:50.163
Ruffians!

06:50.183 --> 06:50.343
De-den!

06:50.383 --> 06:51.683
The disappearance of Pero.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.111
It'll be okay, it'll be okay, right?

07:21.895 --> 07:23.577
But Pero's Pero, right?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.219
It'll be okay, it'll be okay.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.140
Right!

07:27.042 --> 07:31.127
Don't worry about it.

07:33.368 --> 07:34.789
More importantly!

07:34.809 --> 07:39.271
We had some fun this weekend, ruffians!

07:39.351 --> 07:40.612
We did!

07:40.712 --> 07:45.614
This weekend, we made our first appearance at Anime Embrace!

07:45.714 --> 07:46.655
Yeah!

07:46.675 --> 07:48.856
Together with all of you, Advent!

07:49.616 --> 07:50.476
Thank you!

07:50.536 --> 07:54.178
Thank you, ruffians, for being there to see us!

07:54.198 --> 07:57.440
You know, it was a really fun experience.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.421
On Saturday, we had a

07:59.861 --> 08:01.681
Panel bright and early.

08:01.921 --> 08:04.142
It definitely was a busy weekend, right?

08:04.722 --> 08:07.782
We had the panel first thing in the morning on Saturday.

08:08.143 --> 08:12.163
We had a quiz on the knowledge of New York.

08:12.303 --> 08:12.923
Right!

08:12.943 --> 08:14.444
Together with Abyss.

08:14.564 --> 08:16.724
Ruffians, for those of you that couldn't be there.

08:17.544 --> 08:19.965
How much do you think we knew about New York?

08:20.345 --> 08:21.265
Were you impressed?

08:21.285 --> 08:25.586
Did so well.

08:26.026 --> 08:26.906
Are you sure?

08:28.163 --> 08:29.304
Oh, at Anime NYC maybe?

08:29.324 --> 08:29.604
Maybe not.

08:29.624 --> 08:30.164
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:30.184 --> 08:31.105
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:31.185 --> 08:31.745
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:31.765 --> 08:32.305
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:32.325 --> 08:32.985
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:33.005 --> 08:33.546
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:33.566 --> 08:35.827
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:35.847 --> 08:36.707
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:36.727 --> 08:37.348
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:37.428 --> 08:38.828
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:38.848 --> 08:40.209
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:40.229 --> 08:40.869
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:40.889 --> 08:41.530
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:41.550 --> 08:42.290
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:42.310 --> 08:43.051
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:43.111 --> 08:43.711
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:43.731 --> 08:44.351
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:44.371 --> 08:45.452
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:45.472 --> 08:46.372
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:46.612 --> 08:47.493
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:47.513 --> 08:49.374
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:49.394 --> 08:50.354
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:50.474 --> 08:51.295
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:51.315 --> 08:51.955
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:51.975 --> 08:52.535
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:52.555 --> 08:53.816
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:53.836 --> 08:55.017
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:55.037 --> 08:55.857
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:55.877 --> 08:56.677
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:56.697 --> 08:57.278
Maybe not so much the quiz!

08:57.298 --> 08:57.618
Maybe not

08:58.158 --> 09:06.662
But after that, we had our first live performance at the hololive booth where we did a Rock n' Rawr Party Mini!

09:07.162 --> 09:08.003
Yeah!

09:08.023 --> 09:10.164
Look at all the Ruffians!

09:10.224 --> 09:15.146
Yeah, and even though it was a Rock n' Rawr Party Mini, it wasn't really that many.

09:15.446 --> 09:15.826
No.

09:16.607 --> 09:17.627
No, it wasn't that many.

09:17.647 --> 09:21.609
We kind of went over our time by an extra half hour.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.811
It was supposed to be half an hour, but it went a bit longer.

09:25.911 --> 09:27.892
It was just too much fun, you know?

09:28.172 --> 09:31.954
We could hear you BAU BAUing and shouting.

09:31.994 --> 09:32.655
See you shouting.

09:35.359 --> 09:36.260
Was that amazing?

09:36.280 --> 09:37.141
That amazing!

09:37.181 --> 09:38.402
That amazing!

09:38.502 --> 09:41.124
And waving our penlights around too!

09:41.304 --> 09:43.526
So many pink and blue penlights!

09:43.666 --> 09:44.927
Thank you!

09:45.067 --> 09:46.609
We're really happy!

09:47.449 --> 09:54.275
We're really glad that you were there and able to participate virtually through VRChat too!

09:54.636 --> 09:58.119
It looked like you were having lots of fun there.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.421
We got to see all the screenshots on Twitter.

10:00.501 --> 10:00.741
Fun.

10:03.956 --> 10:05.237
You're being silly, huh?

10:06.458 --> 10:07.739
Because that was fun.

10:07.759 --> 10:08.320
Uh-huh.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.882
Well, if it was fun, it was fun.

10:11.903 --> 10:12.523
Uh-huh.

10:12.923 --> 10:17.507
But, you know, we also ended off the weekend with another appearance of the group.

10:17.947 --> 10:20.530
We did an early morning Q&A time.

10:20.770 --> 10:25.794
And, you know, it was just... It was so nice being able to chat face-to-face with you.

10:26.234 --> 10:29.477
Answer some of those burning questions you had, too.

10:29.497 --> 10:31.879
It was just... We had such a good time.

10:32.619 --> 10:34.461
We hope you did too, ruffians, okay?

10:35.301 --> 10:35.601
But!

10:36.182 --> 10:39.724
We hope that we can make even more appearances at events close to you.

10:40.145 --> 10:43.627
You know, be able to meet as many ruffians as possible!

10:44.788 --> 10:48.230
Also, we uploaded a small video from our Rawr Party.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.932
We need to tweet it too!

10:50.032 --> 10:50.252
So...

10:50.772 --> 11:00.036
If you're curious as to what it kinda look like, like New York, you know, more than just this, what the BAU BAU sound is like and everything, please check it out, okay?

11:00.496 --> 11:02.217
BAU BAU!

11:02.277 --> 11:04.358
Thank you, Anime NYC!

11:04.698 --> 11:08.640
I'd really like to be able to go to more places and meet, visit the ruffians, you know?

11:08.660 --> 11:11.301
Visit ruffians, meet more ruffians!

11:11.441 --> 11:15.303
I'd like to be able to talk more closely, too, you know?

11:16.861 --> 11:23.964
FUWAMOCO likes to go meet you!

11:23.984 --> 11:25.664
You'll BAU BAU lots for us, right?

11:25.704 --> 11:28.405
Please BAU BAU lots for us, okay?

11:28.945 --> 11:30.866
BAU BAU!

11:30.886 --> 11:35.728
It was a fun but busy busy weekend, huh?

11:35.868 --> 11:40.850
Wow, tomorrow... Tomorrow is a big day!

11:42.042 --> 11:45.464
We're having our first birthday girl.

11:45.985 --> 11:48.206
And that birthday girl is Nobisai!

11:51.135 --> 11:52.136
Birthday, Moco-chan?

11:52.156 --> 11:52.636
A birthday.

11:52.697 --> 11:53.497
A birthday?

11:53.517 --> 11:53.677
Yes.

11:54.258 --> 11:57.982
Yeah, Nerissa's gonna be having a special celebration too.

11:58.182 --> 12:00.104
Starting at 5pm P.T.I.!

12:00.244 --> 12:01.525
At 10am JST.

12:01.585 --> 12:05.089
And it's gonna have some special announcements too.

12:05.789 --> 12:08.392
Let's all be there to celebrate her special day, okay?

12:08.412 --> 12:08.812
Yeah!

12:08.852 --> 12:09.893
Nerissa November?

12:09.993 --> 12:11.114
Yeah.

12:11.134 --> 12:12.496
Nerissa November?

12:12.836 --> 12:13.016
No.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.379
I don't believe in birthday months.

12:16.411 --> 12:16.971
That's true.

12:17.051 --> 12:18.572
Her birthday's only tomorrow.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.533
Yes, it's a day.

12:19.553 --> 12:21.353
Ready for hours.

12:21.393 --> 12:22.394
Not a minute more.

12:22.594 --> 12:24.275
Yeah.

12:24.495 --> 12:30.938
But as for a gift, I think we might have figured something out, right Moco-chan?

12:30.958 --> 12:32.539
I don't know.

12:33.500 --> 12:38.402
I don't know, I don't want the ruffians to get upset or anything.

12:38.582 --> 12:38.762
What?

12:38.802 --> 12:39.563
What kind?

12:40.943 --> 12:42.764
I think you have the same gift, right Moco-chan?

12:47.532 --> 12:50.293
Ruffians, what kind of gifts are you thinking of?

12:51.434 --> 12:53.435
Pantsu.

12:53.595 --> 12:54.215
What?

12:55.316 --> 12:58.998
No, Nerissa doesn't even need anything like that in the first place.

12:59.018 --> 12:59.618
She doesn't.

13:00.078 --> 13:03.980
She doesn't.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.382
We also wanted to say, we're not going to take that suggestion.

13:07.402 --> 13:07.562
No way.

13:09.554 --> 13:14.276
Well, we hope that you look forward to her birthday celebration as much as we are, okay?

13:14.296 --> 13:16.917
Of course, you can find it on Nerissa's channel, okay?

13:31.482 --> 13:33.923
I don't think she has the waiting room up here.

13:34.123 --> 13:37.325
She's gonna make us wait in anticipation.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.807
BAU BAU!

13:39.867 --> 13:41.588
Happy birthday!

13:41.628 --> 13:42.968
Birthday?

13:43.749 --> 13:45.190
BAU BAU!

13:46.050 --> 13:52.274
Wow, there's also been some really cool new music released!

13:52.454 --> 13:52.994
Ruffians.

13:55.666 --> 14:03.489
Just yesterday, Berry-senpai and Korone-senpai released an original song!

14:04.310 --> 14:06.791
It's called "Bite Kamu Bite".

14:07.371 --> 14:10.492
That's a really cute and catchy song.

14:10.552 --> 14:14.494
It's filled with lots of WAN WAN WAN and CHU CHU CHU.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.335
WAN WAN WAN CHU CHU CHU!

14:16.375 --> 14:18.756
It's different from BAU BAU, not BAU BAU.

14:18.796 --> 14:19.676
It's a WAN WAN WAN.

14:19.716 --> 14:20.496
That's a dog.

14:21.057 --> 14:22.897
Human dogs WAN WAN WAN.

14:24.418 --> 14:25.879
That's what I was thinking.

14:47.068 --> 14:47.468
BAU BAU!

15:18.096 --> 15:21.620
Ruffians.

15:22.301 --> 15:23.782
Ruffians.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.625
Ruffians.

15:29.669 --> 15:33.032
There's been a misunderstanding again.

15:33.513 --> 15:36.836
But I sort of feel like it's not really our fault.

15:36.856 --> 15:37.477
I don't know.

15:38.683 --> 15:40.324
I don't know, I don't really get it.

15:40.344 --> 15:55.231
I think, you know, ruffians, I think there are a few of you who are thinking that, you know, FUWAMOCO might be releasing, like, an intense rap track to come sometime soon.

15:57.152 --> 16:01.655
This is all because of our newest rivals.

16:01.755 --> 16:02.015
Hi!

16:03.756 --> 16:05.337
It's kind of your fault, Ruffians.

16:05.357 --> 16:08.760
And that's why I don't think it's our fault, you know?

16:09.000 --> 16:22.792
But, in case you don't know, during our Super Chat reading the other day, there was mention about how our Rock n' Rawr Party mini was just as fun as an ex-Japan or a Kendrick Lamar concert.

16:23.432 --> 16:26.555
And, you know, I got a bit envious.

16:29.577 --> 16:34.180
So, we named X Japan and Kendrick Lamar as our rivals.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.320
Rivals!

16:35.581 --> 16:38.742
You know, we want the ruffians to have the most fun with us.

16:38.842 --> 16:39.423
With us!

16:39.563 --> 16:40.103
Yeah.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.785
We're hungry puppies.

16:43.065 --> 16:52.110
So, you know, it's not really that abnormal for us to have one or two or maybe a handful of healthy rivals.

16:52.130 --> 16:52.470
Right!

16:52.510 --> 16:53.791
What do you think, ruffians?

16:53.831 --> 16:56.393
It's good to have healthy rivals, you know.

16:56.433 --> 16:56.653
Yeah.

16:57.293 --> 16:57.793
Why?

16:58.233 --> 17:05.915
Well, we know it's Japan, but... You know, we still don't really know who Kendrick Lamar is at all.

17:06.195 --> 17:10.176
No... I couldn't remember his name, to be honest, at first.

17:10.356 --> 17:12.156
I had to get a bit of a reminder.

17:12.676 --> 17:22.198
But, uh... Yeah, but... You know, Ruffians, it... It seems like... Some of you... Quite a few of you are his fans.

17:22.698 --> 17:23.138
You know?

17:23.158 --> 17:24.679
But... Now...

17:27.176 --> 17:31.398
Are you expecting us to do that thing where we battle him and say some grumpy things?

17:35.079 --> 17:39.941
You know, I don't think we can really do that, but we are rivals!

17:39.961 --> 17:40.041
Yeah!

17:40.081 --> 17:40.721
Yeah!

17:41.142 --> 17:44.743
Yeah, he's our rival, but... but...

17:46.278 --> 17:49.499
Maybe, maybe, maybe can we turn the tables a little bit?

17:49.519 --> 17:54.901
And instead, come meet us halfway and we could have a BAU BAU BATTLE!

17:55.021 --> 17:56.062
BAU BAU BATTLE!

17:56.322 --> 17:59.163
I'm the fastest BAU BAUer though.

18:00.323 --> 18:02.404
What do you think, ruffians?

18:02.904 --> 18:05.325
Maybe that's a bit more fair, right?

18:06.046 --> 18:07.226
BAU BAU BATTLE!

18:07.326 --> 18:07.766
Right!

18:07.786 --> 18:12.208
Do you think Kendrick Lamar could be a good BAU BAUer?

18:14.349 --> 18:21.234
Moco-chan, how do you think you BAU- How do you think you combined with BAU BAU?

18:23.815 --> 18:25.536
Maybe one day we'll find out!

18:25.616 --> 18:26.097
Right!

18:27.117 --> 18:27.598
Right!

18:29.739 --> 18:31.060
Let's look forward to that day!

18:32.221 --> 18:32.941
BAU BAU!

18:34.462 --> 18:35.103
I'm probably not.

18:36.023 --> 18:36.664
Probably not.

18:38.345 --> 18:38.505
Yeah.

18:41.280 --> 18:41.600
BAU BAU!

18:41.640 --> 18:42.060
We gotta practice.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.321
We gotta practice.

18:43.661 --> 18:44.241
We don't need to practice.

18:44.261 --> 18:45.062
We are professional BAU BAUers.

18:45.082 --> 19:08.673
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

19:13.743 --> 19:15.124
It's me, Pero.

19:16.084 --> 19:18.906
As you can see, ruffians, I'm on my vacation.

19:19.786 --> 19:24.268
You know, I thought, I've been working hard, I deserve it, right?

19:24.589 --> 19:29.091
You know, those thumbnails don't make themselves.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.573
Let me take off my glasses here, then I can see a bit better now.

19:33.854 --> 19:35.675
Well, did you forget about me?

19:36.335 --> 19:37.216
No, right!

19:37.776 --> 19:41.679
Because you keep on taking photos of me when I'm out and about!

19:42.339 --> 19:44.400
Stop snitching on me to FUWAMOCO!

19:45.201 --> 19:46.702
You wouldn't like that, would you?

19:46.722 --> 19:46.762
Ha!

19:49.243 --> 19:50.524
I'm a demon guard dog.

19:51.124 --> 19:51.925
I'm their master.

19:51.945 --> 19:55.026
I don't need to be kept to rack of or controlled.

19:55.907 --> 20:02.251
But, I guess if I have to say, I am happy that because of you,

20:03.052 --> 20:04.633
FUWAMOCO won't forget about me.

20:05.933 --> 20:07.854
I'm an old dog now.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.214
There are fun things going on.

20:11.215 --> 20:13.856
They're more preoccupied with you ruffians, huh?

20:14.656 --> 20:14.916
Good.

20:16.277 --> 20:19.358
But I'm happy they're still wondering a bit about me.

20:20.138 --> 20:20.598
I guess.

20:22.259 --> 20:22.519
Yeah.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.940
I'll still be around, so keep an eye on me, okay?

20:27.680 --> 20:28.621
Got it, ruffians?

20:29.835 --> 20:32.976
I have a bunch of things to do and knowledge to gather.

20:32.996 --> 20:36.977
And then, then I can pass that on to FUWAMOCO.

20:37.678 --> 20:42.479
So, if we cross paths, yeah, you better treat me right.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.760
I'm to be revered.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.541
Revered!

20:47.501 --> 20:48.601
I'm the master!

20:49.662 --> 20:50.622
I'm Pero!

20:51.442 --> 20:51.862
Got it.

20:54.243 --> 20:55.524
I'll get back to my drink then.

20:56.564 --> 20:57.204
Pero out!

20:57.684 --> 20:59.205
See you later, ruffians!

21:09.091 --> 21:10.051
That was strange.

21:10.752 --> 21:13.993
Ruffians!

21:14.013 --> 21:18.835
So I guess Pero was just on vacation.

21:20.116 --> 21:22.136
I guess?

21:22.176 --> 21:24.017
Maybe that's why we didn't see him.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.478
Is he really actually doing anything there?

21:26.978 --> 21:30.100
Is he actually gathering information?

21:35.120 --> 21:42.765
He says he needs a vacation, but... I don't know what he's doing that much.

21:44.347 --> 21:48.029
I don't know what it is.

21:48.450 --> 21:54.034
It seems like, you know, maybe Pero's a little bit... Abyss?

21:54.514 --> 21:54.854
Abyss?

21:55.194 --> 21:55.575
Jealous?

21:55.595 --> 21:55.915
Jealous?

21:58.717 --> 22:00.538
Maybe that's why he needs vacations.

22:00.658 --> 22:02.579
He needs vacations from his emotions.

22:02.759 --> 22:05.380
All the stress and anxiety, maybe?

22:05.880 --> 22:10.723
You know, now that FUWAMOCO's having a bit of fun with the ruffians!

22:10.803 --> 22:11.203
Maybe.

22:13.744 --> 22:17.906
But this kind of Pero's still kind of working hard.

22:18.487 --> 22:18.887
Is he?

22:18.907 --> 22:19.687
Yeah.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.768
Does he know that?

22:22.188 --> 22:23.209
How to work hard?

22:27.077 --> 22:29.999
It's good that we got an update from Pero, huh?

22:30.239 --> 22:33.001
Don't be that excited, okay, ruffians?

22:33.281 --> 22:34.061
It's just Pero.

22:35.462 --> 22:38.704
Who do you like better, ruffians?

22:38.784 --> 22:40.885
Pero or FUWAMOCO?

22:45.088 --> 22:45.368
Huh?

22:48.210 --> 22:48.410
Huh?

22:50.291 --> 22:50.791
Huh?

23:22.877 --> 23:23.518
Ruffians.

23:28.001 --> 23:30.042
Moco-chan, I guess we should continue.

23:34.185 --> 23:35.046
A Doggie of the Day.

23:35.086 --> 23:36.087
A Doggie of the Day.

23:36.627 --> 23:40.190
These doggies of the day haven't done anything wrong!

23:40.810 --> 23:43.933
There are two doggies today in Hachien City!

23:43.993 --> 23:45.534
They're very cute.

23:45.694 --> 23:47.715
I'm not happy, but they're very, very cute.

23:47.735 --> 23:48.716
Wait, Moco-chan.

23:49.577 --> 23:49.897
What?

23:52.768 --> 23:55.969
We have a challenge to do!

23:56.049 --> 24:00.350
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:22.034 --> 24:23.495
Ruffians don't remember.

24:25.295 --> 24:26.756
It's a birthday!

24:27.196 --> 24:39.020
It's a new week, and that means Moco-chan is going to be challenging herself to eat some more natto!

24:40.400 --> 24:41.701
Moco-chan.

24:41.721 --> 24:43.881
Trying to be tricky.

24:44.302 --> 24:45.682
I'm not.

24:46.162 --> 24:50.844
Well, today Moco-chan will be eating natto once more.

24:52.596 --> 25:05.457
To be honest, Ruffians, I've lost track of how many times Moco-chan has tried this, but... But it's okay because today she's going to show a lot of progress, right?

25:05.918 --> 25:06.279
Right?

25:07.790 --> 25:13.616
For any ruffians that might not know what natto is, natto is a common breakfast food in Japan.

25:13.676 --> 25:15.958
It's made up of fermented soybeans.

25:16.799 --> 25:29.852
It's really good for you, it's really yummy, but it's kind of sticky, and smelly, and strong smelling, and maybe it's a bit of an acquired taste, but it's yummy and I like it, and it's really healthy for you.

25:29.992 --> 25:30.432
FUWAMOCO-chan.

25:59.744 --> 26:02.225
Do you remember what happened at Anime NYC?

26:03.705 --> 26:04.446
Right.

26:04.566 --> 26:07.307
Right, you made a promise there.

26:07.787 --> 26:08.247
I did.

26:08.627 --> 26:09.167
Right.

26:09.847 --> 26:10.888
To Victoria.

26:11.088 --> 26:12.708
To Victoria, yeah.

26:12.748 --> 26:17.110
And she's going to be doing her best to eat it today too, right?

26:17.790 --> 26:20.411
So, Moco-chan, you have a buddy up there!

26:22.963 --> 26:27.925
This is only for Victoria and not the ruffians that said they like pale bear, okay?

26:29.166 --> 26:29.946
Not for you.

26:29.966 --> 26:35.148
Moco-chan, make sure you eat as much as you can together with her.

26:35.208 --> 26:35.649
Okay.

26:35.669 --> 26:36.049
Give it!

26:36.169 --> 26:37.449
I'm gonna stir it up!

26:38.390 --> 26:41.351
It needs to be stirred up so it gets nice and fluffy.

26:41.371 --> 26:45.593
Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy, fluffy, fluffy natto.

26:46.033 --> 26:46.773
Was a joke.

26:48.374 --> 26:48.834
Huh?

26:49.454 --> 26:50.055
Not a joke.

26:51.690 --> 26:52.692
Don't spill it.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.756
I almost spilled it everywhere.

26:55.776 --> 26:58.219
It almost got on me.

27:00.723 --> 27:01.744
Not on me.

27:02.906 --> 27:03.747
Okay!

27:03.767 --> 27:05.029
It's ready.

27:06.031 --> 27:07.513
Moco-chan, first.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.864
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked hard to make it.

27:11.884 --> 27:17.049
I'll say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi, but not to the ruffians that said they like petal better!

27:18.031 --> 27:19.172
Cheer up, Moco-chan.

27:19.632 --> 27:22.175
It'll all be good once you eat this all with Victoria.

27:23.076 --> 27:23.837
Okay!

27:23.857 --> 27:26.660
That's not the chopsticks I like.

27:29.555 --> 27:35.297
And today, ruffians, I even offered Moco-chan, do you want to use some soy sauce?

27:36.037 --> 27:39.258
And Moco-chan said, no, I think it'll just make me feel worse.

27:39.838 --> 27:42.319
I don't know, I think you're pretty hungry this morning, right?

27:42.339 --> 27:44.120
Right?

27:47.281 --> 27:49.142
Why are you spooking so sad?

27:52.336 --> 27:53.756
Moco-chan will do it!

27:53.817 --> 27:55.817
You have extra motivation.

27:56.237 --> 27:57.638
I'll do it for Victoria.

27:57.758 --> 27:59.038
Only for Victoria.

27:59.118 --> 27:59.598
Yeah.

28:00.999 --> 28:05.060
Moco-chan, you need to pick up more than just one single solo bean.

28:05.600 --> 28:10.422
I will pick up a solo bean and I will do my best for Victoria.

28:11.362 --> 28:13.623
Victoria wants you to eat more than just one bean.

28:13.663 --> 28:14.483
No, she told me.

28:14.503 --> 28:15.183
She said one.

28:15.283 --> 28:15.983
She told me.

28:16.003 --> 28:16.964
She said one!

28:16.984 --> 28:21.085
Oh, I can hear her right now.

28:24.550 --> 28:27.412
Victory for victory and Victoria!

28:27.432 --> 28:29.934
She's gonna beat you if you're not careful, Moco-chan.

28:30.114 --> 28:31.975
I'm gonna try it, okay.

28:32.115 --> 28:33.456
Okay, do you need a countdown?

28:35.578 --> 28:35.798
No.

28:36.679 --> 28:36.859
No.

28:38.220 --> 28:38.980
Okay!

28:39.001 --> 28:40.882
I need a tissue.

28:41.783 --> 28:43.544
I don't need a countdown, I need a tissue.

28:43.624 --> 28:43.904
Oh wait.

28:44.485 --> 28:47.547
There's my tissue, but... Okay, there's my tissue.

28:52.729 --> 28:54.710
It's just one bean.

28:55.210 --> 28:57.551
It's better than the dry natto, right?

28:58.391 --> 29:04.292
The dry natto was just weird.

29:07.233 --> 29:08.734
The strings, I can see them.

29:08.874 --> 29:11.134
Stop commenting on the strings!

29:11.154 --> 29:14.075
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

29:19.215 --> 29:19.436
Eat!

29:19.496 --> 29:19.596
Eat!

29:19.676 --> 29:19.876
Eat!

29:19.896 --> 29:19.956
Eat!

29:41.769 --> 29:43.730
Why did you not swallow it?

29:43.770 --> 29:46.171
That's how eating works, Moco-chan.

29:47.932 --> 29:55.356
That's how eating works, you just... So wait, Moco-chan, maybe there's a fundamental flaw here in your strategy.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.277
No, I'm trying!

29:57.397 --> 30:00.339
You just put it in your mouth and just let it sit there.

30:01.670 --> 30:02.871
What about Victoria?

30:03.251 --> 30:05.432
I did it for Victoria!

30:06.192 --> 30:07.133
One more.

30:07.273 --> 30:07.753
No.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.754
I'll select a small one just for you.

30:09.774 --> 30:10.375
Look at it.

30:10.435 --> 30:10.935
No.

30:11.015 --> 30:11.495
It's so small.

30:11.535 --> 30:12.356
No!

30:12.436 --> 30:13.877
I'm a small little bean.

30:13.897 --> 30:13.937
No.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.978
Moco-chan.

30:28.160 --> 30:33.725
Doggie of the Day!

30:34.065 --> 30:36.787
I like that much more than Natto.

30:36.867 --> 30:38.008
I like the expression.

30:38.489 --> 30:42.072
She's like... I don't like Natto.

30:44.369 --> 30:48.871
Well, Suri likes to sit on her brother as a sign of affection, and I get that.

30:49.011 --> 30:51.692
I'm not careful, I'm gonna get knocked all over the place here.

30:52.613 --> 30:57.675
Yeah, and apparently Suri also likes to do it all the time.

30:57.695 --> 31:00.076
I think it's pretty cute.

31:00.196 --> 31:05.939
Sometimes it sort of happens when I sit down on the sofa after Fuwawa.

31:07.539 --> 31:11.081
Well, that's what I was gonna ask, Moco-chan.

31:11.501 --> 31:11.941
You know,

31:14.013 --> 31:15.274
I'm not a good princess.

31:15.474 --> 31:15.534
Why?

31:44.154 --> 31:48.957
I think Suri goes like BAU BAU!

31:49.257 --> 31:51.398
And Hachi is also like BAU BAU!

31:51.979 --> 31:52.799
They sound the same.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.602
They're similar.

31:57.862 --> 31:58.583
I don't know.

31:58.603 --> 32:04.187
It sure seems like Suri knows how to get away with being babied.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.128
Maybe a little bit like Moco-chan.

32:07.208 --> 32:07.729
What?! !

32:09.748 --> 32:11.809
And that's okay, Moco-chan, you know?

32:12.710 --> 32:15.192
I'll be your Hachi if you need me to be.

32:15.892 --> 32:16.893
You'll be my Hachi?

32:16.913 --> 32:17.474
Yeah.

32:17.674 --> 32:18.714
I'm fluffy, you know?

32:18.915 --> 32:19.315
Yeah.

32:19.495 --> 32:21.176
I can be the comfy pillow, maybe.

32:22.477 --> 32:23.798
But... Yeah.

32:23.919 --> 32:28.182
I think, you know, Hachi doesn't mind either for his sister, so... Yeah.

32:28.262 --> 32:29.203
They're good doggies.

32:29.223 --> 32:30.223
They're good doggies.

32:30.303 --> 32:30.904
I like them.

32:31.084 --> 32:32.885
A wonderful family.

32:33.226 --> 32:33.806
I like them.

32:34.106 --> 32:35.347
BAU BAU!

32:35.367 --> 32:35.868
BAU BAU!

32:41.727 --> 32:44.249
Today I went on a walk.

32:45.150 --> 32:47.011
Where did we go for a walk this time?

32:47.812 --> 32:53.916
It's like rain.

32:53.936 --> 32:55.637
Tense weather.

32:55.998 --> 32:58.199
It looks so cool though.

32:58.419 --> 33:01.001
But you didn't get rained on or anything, right?

33:01.021 --> 33:02.102
Did you miss the rain?

33:02.182 --> 33:02.762
Hopefully.

33:04.815 --> 33:11.320
I don't really like the rain, but the one thing I do like about the rain is the smell of the ground after.

33:11.400 --> 33:15.282
Sometimes, just thinking about it, you know, it can awaken something in us.

33:15.342 --> 33:17.184
So it's really annoying me.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.485
All right.

33:18.925 --> 33:24.709
Well, you know, we hope you can avoid the rain while going on some more nice walks, too.

33:24.909 --> 33:25.289
Yeah!

33:26.250 --> 33:26.670
BAU BAU!

33:27.211 --> 33:30.033
Those buildings are really tall, though, right?

33:30.942 --> 33:33.582
What do we have for our question of the day?

33:33.803 --> 33:35.903
We have... De-den!

33:36.463 --> 33:37.523
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

33:37.703 --> 33:38.323
Hello!

33:38.583 --> 33:42.104
Did you know that dogs commonly get ear infections?

33:42.564 --> 33:47.085
Does FUWAMOCO clean their ears often, check each other's, and put in ear drops?

33:47.585 --> 33:51.566
Should you guys like doctors and probably touch your ears for health?

33:51.646 --> 33:53.246
I hope FUWAMOCO is staying healthy.

33:53.266 --> 33:56.346
Well, don't touch each other's ears.

33:57.067 --> 33:57.247
No.

33:57.767 --> 33:59.167
But ear infections...

33:59.807 --> 34:00.448
Ear infections.

34:00.468 --> 34:00.968
They hurt.

34:01.028 --> 34:01.849
They hurt, right.

34:02.089 --> 34:03.750
It's important to take care of yourself.

34:04.791 --> 34:07.653
But, it's important to take care of your ears.

34:07.734 --> 34:08.934
Clean your ears, okay?

34:09.935 --> 34:14.619
But especially since our headphones make our demon dog ears feel a bit funny.

34:14.759 --> 34:17.882
We have to wear them for a long period of time.

34:17.902 --> 34:28.330
Yeah, it gets a bit funny, but... Actually, I used to have troubles with ear infections and had to see the ear doctor quite a bit.

34:29.853 --> 34:38.398
It was really bad, but one time they were looking in my ear to see if they could see anything like a hole in the eardrum.

34:38.418 --> 34:41.160
They couldn't find it for the life of them.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.521
It wasn't good.

34:43.602 --> 34:46.964
Yeah, until they realized they were looking through it.

34:47.584 --> 34:48.425
Through the hole.

34:52.355 --> 34:58.737
You know, that was a long, long time ago and it hasn't been a problem for many dog years.

34:58.937 --> 34:59.877
Not good though, huh?

34:59.917 --> 35:01.998
Yeah, but ear drops aren't fun.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.198
Eye drops aren't fun.

35:04.618 --> 35:06.459
Being sick, it's not fun.

35:07.299 --> 35:08.699
It's important to stay healthy, okay?

35:08.739 --> 35:11.320
Let's make sure to stay healthy, okay, ruffians?

35:11.340 --> 35:13.041
BAU BAU!

35:17.838 --> 35:21.301
Thank you again so much for all your submissions, ruffians!

35:21.701 --> 35:25.464
It's nice to know that we got a bit of an update from Pero there, right?

35:26.945 --> 35:29.106
I wish he would not be on vacation.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.897
Thank you so much, ruffians!

35:34.117 --> 35:35.958
Let's take a look at our next theme!

35:36.018 --> 35:38.380
We have Metal Gear Solid!

35:38.440 --> 35:47.245
For today, you know, we're gonna be off and we're gonna be resting up and getting a bunch of homework done, but tomorrow we're playing Metal Gear Solid again!

35:48.386 --> 35:52.150
You know, we had a bunch of fun last week as we just started it.

35:53.170 --> 35:55.032
I'm looking forward to see what happens next.

35:55.332 --> 35:58.255
Yeah, now we have our PS1 memory card too.

35:58.295 --> 35:59.116
Yeah.

35:59.236 --> 35:59.756
No worrying.

35:59.776 --> 36:02.519
No worrying about saving, but we're gonna make sure to save a lot.

36:02.719 --> 36:02.939
Yes.

36:02.999 --> 36:06.442
Definitely, Moco-chan, you'll be doing that because you like to save a lot.

36:06.563 --> 36:07.183
I like to save.

36:07.343 --> 36:10.606
Yeah, well let's do our best to sneak, sneak, sneak!

36:10.726 --> 36:11.667
Yeah!

36:11.787 --> 36:12.428
BAU BAU!

36:13.028 --> 36:14.189
And our schedule!

36:14.369 --> 36:16.131
Our brand new schedule!

36:17.231 --> 36:19.193
This week, this weekend!

36:19.453 --> 36:21.895
It's twin day on the 25th!

36:21.955 --> 36:23.576
Eifutago no hi!

36:23.656 --> 36:31.542
So we're gonna be celebrating it with a collab all about twins together with Rui-nee-san for the first time!

36:32.202 --> 36:37.967
We'll also be releasing a new FUWAMOCO cover song after it and then having an after party!

36:38.527 --> 36:39.007
After that.

36:39.187 --> 36:40.668
After it and after party.

36:40.748 --> 36:42.129
After party, yeah.

36:42.169 --> 36:48.852
You know, but we hope that you know that every song cover is really important to us and special to us.

36:48.872 --> 36:50.132
We hope you'll be there.

36:50.212 --> 36:56.315
Yeah, we put a lot of work into it, so we hope that you'll listen and be there on that release.

36:56.455 --> 36:56.755
Okay.

36:57.476 --> 36:57.996
Thank you!

36:58.036 --> 36:59.337
Thank you!
