00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:20.266
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:22.428
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:29.212
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:33.695
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:34.236
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:47.087
Are you unsure today?

00:05:47.107 --> 00:05:47.147
No!

00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:54.391
Not like it's our FUWAMOCO birthday today, right?

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:57.033
BAU BAU!

00:05:57.693 --> 00:06:00.955
And today, it's our birthday!

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.457
And we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:05.537
BAU BAU!

00:06:06.578 --> 00:06:08.999
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:11.700
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:20.485
Thank you for joining us today for our 76th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning and on our birthday!

00:06:20.905 --> 00:06:21.485
BAU BAU!

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:27.869
To be exact, Moco-chan, your birthday, right?

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.370
My birthday.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.491
Your birthday.

00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.354
Happy birthday, Moco-chan.

00:06:34.614 --> 00:06:35.514
Thank you!

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:41.539
It's an extra special episode of FUWAMOCO Morning today.

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.120
But, Ruffians!

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.362
There might be a couple of Ruffians who've stumbled in today, you know what I mean?

00:06:48.602 --> 00:06:52.403
Oh, it's a little bit of a extra special FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:53.044 --> 00:06:53.764
Wow.

00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:56.645
It's not every day, it's our birthday.

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:57.166
BAU!

00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:57.806
It's just once a year.

00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:06.116
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:07.896
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:10.937
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:11.717 --> 00:07:17.939
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:22.240
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.421
FWMC Morning!

00:07:24.582 --> 00:07:28.685
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.146
BAU BAU!

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:33.288
Ruffians!

00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:36.390
You don't need to celebrate the hashtag, hashtag.

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:41.494
It's not what you're supposed to be celebrating today.

00:07:41.514 --> 00:07:41.554
No!

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.676
What are they supposed to be celebrating, huh, Moco-chan?

00:07:45.057 --> 00:07:50.641
Why are all these streamers and the balloons and presents?

00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:55.077
BAU BAU!

00:07:55.137 --> 00:07:58.599
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:01.880
It's an extra, extra special day today.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.640
I wonder what it could be hard.

00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:05.601
Just a thought.

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:14.004
Isn't it so wonderful to get to wake up and spend a birthday morning together with the Ruffians?

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:14.685
BAU BAU.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.365
No words can get better than BAU.

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:18.246
Wow.

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:24.150
Well... It's about to get worse, Ruffians.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:30.975
Because... There's been... Another Pero Sighting.

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:39.641
On our birthday... We already had Pero leave us that nasty birthday message, right?

00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:43.563
What now?

00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:44.184
Well...

00:08:46.647 --> 00:08:54.852
Let's see what the Ruffians saw, huh?

00:08:55.092 --> 00:08:56.313
What's this?

00:08:57.013 --> 00:09:03.897
A birthday party for... Pero?

00:09:04.238 --> 00:09:05.839
You did all this for him?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.403
That's nice that you prepared this wonderful birthday party for him.

00:09:13.663 --> 00:09:14.364
All for him!

00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:15.825
Fine.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.883
All the pink decorations!

00:09:20.324 --> 00:09:21.084
And you know it!

00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:24.445
It being my birthday today too!

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:31.626
No, I definitely didn't think that maybe this was prepared for my birthday.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:35.567
It's all for Pero's birthday, huh?

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:37.968
Now...

00:09:38.752 --> 00:09:41.614
Pero's deciding to take over my birthday too.

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:44.816
No, I already had to share it with Fuwawa.

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:52.061
And now finally when I get to celebrate my birthday, just my own birthday this year, with the Ruffians now.

00:09:56.584 --> 00:09:56.945
No.

00:09:58.406 --> 00:10:00.447
Pero is truly nasty.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.881
Don't worry, Moco-chan.

00:10:08.222 --> 00:10:11.124
It'll be a wonderful birthday for you today.

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:19.712
It's really nice that you decided to organize this big birthday party all for Pero.

00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:21.273
I guess it's a nice effort.

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:21.673
Right?

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:22.954
Look at Pero!

00:10:22.974 --> 00:10:23.975
Do you see?

00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:26.197
I guess he's so happy.

00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:27.939
I should be happy for him.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.242
Just don't forget that it's my birthday too, okay?

00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:35.822
What is Pero's birthday?

00:10:36.923 --> 00:10:37.843
He's too nasty.

00:10:37.863 --> 00:10:39.244
He doesn't get a birthday.

00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:43.405
Well, then... I guess I'm happy for him.

00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:49.407
If he doesn't get a birthday ever, then... I guess I'm happy.

00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:55.770
Let's all make sure that we celebrate Moco-chan's birthday today.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.491
And, uh... Well, Pero, you know...

00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:02.089
Maybe he can come a little later.

00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:03.550
Right?

00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:05.791
Maybe.

00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.354
BAU BAU!

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:11.555
He does look really happy though.

00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:12.796
Right?

00:11:12.876 --> 00:11:17.580
You can just feel the happiness radiating from his lumpy body.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:22.584
I just... BAU BAU!

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:25.446
Ruffians!

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:36.910
I want to say thank you so much for celebrating my birthday yesterday!

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:42.252
Yesterday, my 48 hours FUWAMOCO birthday officially started.

00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:47.134
As you know, we counted down the very first moments to it all together.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:53.134
In the evening yesterday, it was my birthday party!

00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:53.574
Yeah!

00:11:53.614 --> 00:11:55.256
Your first birthday party!

00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:58.220
First one ever!

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.487
You know, I love the barns and I sang my favorite songs for you.

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:09.396
Thank you Ruffians for having so much fun together with me!

00:12:09.976 --> 00:12:13.900
I'll never ever forget it!

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.044
We also received some birthday messages and gifts from Advent.

00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:25.429
I also got a really sweet letter from you, Moco-chan!

00:12:28.592 --> 00:12:30.874
What was it that you called me, Moco-chan?

00:12:34.574 --> 00:12:36.299
Nothing!

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.760
I was so happy!

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.142
Thank you, Ruffians, for making me the happiest and fluffiest demon dog in the world!

00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:54.723
BAU BAU!

00:12:54.963 --> 00:12:55.423
But!

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.404
Today!

00:12:58.064 --> 00:13:01.845
Today is Moco-chan's birthday!

00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:03.806
Your big day!

00:13:04.206 --> 00:13:05.866
Happy birthday, Moco-chan.

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:08.207
BAU BAU!

00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:10.868
The birthday celebration never would stop.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:18.873
Make sure you don't forget about my birthday too, okay?

00:13:19.073 --> 00:13:24.637
The 48-hour FUWAMOCO Birthday continues, Ruffians!

00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:27.479
BAU BAU!

00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.082
I can't believe it, you know.

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:34.204
We get to have such a special FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:35.925
A birthday FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:36.385
Why?

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:43.427
You know, Mama Puppy would always celebrate our birthday morning very specially, BAU.

00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:48.089
Well, this is just about right up there, huh?

00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:50.409
BAU BAU!

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:52.310
Wow, Ruffians!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:59.211
Not only was it my birthday, but I also had a little surprise for you.

00:13:59.652 --> 00:14:04.373
I announced my first birthday merch!

00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:04.813
BAU BAU!

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:14.672
I feel so excited and happy to be able to share this with you, Ruffians!

00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:16.554
Do you see?

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:24.342
My birthday merch has such a beautiful illustration by Miwami Sakura-sensei!

00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:25.323
You know?

00:14:26.023 --> 00:14:28.646
And, well, you can see it right here, nice and big.

00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.328
Do you want to take a closer look?

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:45.692
But, while here's my birthday mindset, if you really want to be able to enjoy the illustration even more, well, I have a dual-lid acrylic pa- acrylic!

00:14:46.012 --> 00:14:47.052
What did you say?

00:14:47.192 --> 00:14:48.653
Acrylic paddle!

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:54.454
As well as also a bonus postcard with my signature printed in gold on it.

00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:55.115
Right.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:58.956
It's not very often that you get to see my signature, huh, Ruffians?

00:14:59.196 --> 00:14:59.596
But!

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:02.037
Hi!

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:12.425
I think, you know, this is maybe what I'm looking for the very, very most, I'm most excited for this!

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:13.666
The Ruffian!

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.327
Ruffian!

00:15:14.587 --> 00:15:15.287
Ruffian!

00:15:15.367 --> 00:15:16.628
BAU BAU!

00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.270
Look at him!

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.631
He's so cute!

00:15:20.692 --> 00:15:23.033
With the little glasses there!

00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:24.554
Little legs!

00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:25.996
Ruffians!

00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:29.278
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:29.298 --> 00:15:29.598
BAU BAU!

00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:31.899
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:32.600
BAU BAU!

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.063
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:53.939 --> 00:16:00.063
You know, I hope that you'll decide to give lots of hugs, lots of head pats, too.

00:16:00.884 --> 00:16:02.985
I'm definitely looking forward to it, too.

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:04.566
BAU BAU!

00:16:04.846 --> 00:16:08.829
And we have my Fuwawa motif t-shirt!

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:12.291
Now, you might think, oh, it's just a white t-shirt.

00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:13.232
It is not!

00:16:13.512 --> 00:16:14.453
Don't you dare!

00:16:14.813 --> 00:16:20.337
Look, it has my little flames just like on my cool jacket here.

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:23.519
And our Advent branding label there.

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:29.342
And on the background, we have some very cute Fuwawa pondering.

00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:31.743
With my name right there.

00:16:32.103 --> 00:16:34.945
You know it's nice because, well, it's not like...

00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:45.355
If you had my face big and printed on it, maybe it might be hard to like, where if you're gonna go, maybe see your parents, you know?

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:49.558
But this way, you can still be like, yes!

00:16:50.599 --> 00:16:51.419
Yeah!

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.220
Way to work, okay!

00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:56.403
It's very work appropriate.

00:16:56.643 --> 00:16:59.405
You know they have the, what's the word?

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:01.346
The Fridays.

00:17:01.446 --> 00:17:02.887
You know the casual Fridays?

00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:05.228
Casual Fridays!

00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:08.797
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:17:16.712 --> 00:17:21.835
But not just that, we also have my FUWAMOCO keychain!

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.996
Look, my fluffy tail's there!

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:29.819
But, well, unlike the actual thing, this time it's made out of rubber.

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.700
My tail is not rubber.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.022
It's not that fluffy, huh?

00:17:35.383 --> 00:17:37.584
In reality, it's very fluffy.

00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:41.926
But we also have an acrylic pattern with my name there!

00:17:42.387 --> 00:17:44.108
That way you know you can-

00:17:46.562 --> 00:17:47.703
Bless you.

00:17:47.823 --> 00:17:49.244
Happy birthday bless you.

00:17:49.744 --> 00:17:52.326
Birthday sneeze!

00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:57.028
But this way there's no way you can get confused and think, oh this is Moco-chan's tail.

00:17:57.528 --> 00:17:59.029
No, it's mine.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.970
Exactly!

00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:02.971
BAU BAU!

00:18:03.972 --> 00:18:09.075
And well, we also have an extra special birthday voice part.

00:18:10.354 --> 00:18:12.421
Special situation boys and all.

00:18:12.763 --> 00:18:15.854
You know how FUWAMOCO really like going on walks?

00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:21.614
Well, I wanted to go on a little bit of a forest adventure with you.

00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:23.795
So, I hope that you'll listen to it.

00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:26.517
It's recorded in Japanese and English.

00:18:27.037 --> 00:18:33.642
So, please listen to it and maybe you can see, oh, a lot of different sides of Fuwawa, too.

00:18:34.422 --> 00:18:37.204
BAU BAU!

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:39.806
And we have the complete set.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:43.208
If you purchase it, you get a little bit of a bonus.

00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:44.489
It comes with a

00:18:45.009 --> 00:18:48.597
Appreciation voice also in Japanese and English.

00:18:48.998 --> 00:18:54.690
You know, because I really, really want to be able to say a big thank you to you.

00:18:56.173 --> 00:19:00.154
And well, I know there was a limited edition set.

00:19:00.694 --> 00:19:05.915
Thank you, Ruffians, so much for getting your paws on them.

00:19:06.035 --> 00:19:09.496
I think it sold out in a few seconds.

00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:10.776
Very, very fast.

00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:11.736
Very fast.

00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:18.098
But the limited edition, it came with my very own handwritten autograph.

00:19:18.138 --> 00:19:19.058
But don't worry about that.

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:40.976
Cause there's also the complete set and like I mentioned there's a postcard with Miwabe Sakura-sensei's illustration on it and also with my signature printed gold on it too. So I really hope that you'll pick up the complete set because there's so many exciting goodies in it, you know, and well...

00:19:42.757 --> 00:19:51.680
I just feel so lucky and so happy to be able to have this opportunity to be able to release merch as a member of hololive.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:59.722
I really hope that Ruffians are as excited as me and that you'll check them out, okay?

00:20:00.322 --> 00:20:04.123
Everything which will only be on sale until the beginning of March.

00:20:04.463 --> 00:20:06.544
So don't miss out, okay Ruffians?

00:20:06.724 --> 00:20:08.985
Not that long of a window, huh?

00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:09.865
Oh, wait.

00:20:11.182 --> 00:20:16.115
I'm also Ruffians.

00:20:19.088 --> 00:20:19.989
BAU BAU!

00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:24.831
Thank you!

00:20:27.432 --> 00:20:29.614
Nothing funny, nothing silly.

00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:32.295
BAU BAU!

00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:36.197
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:20:36.857 --> 00:20:41.540
Now you know it's just the exciting part until we can get our paws on them.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.521
BAU BAU!

00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:47.282
Well, the excitement doesn't end.

00:20:47.302 --> 00:20:48.562
It does not end!

00:20:48.842 --> 00:20:53.724
This week it's been a bit of a rollercoaster that's just going up, up, up, up!

00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:55.924
You know, it happens six more times a week.

00:20:55.944 --> 00:20:57.685
That makes it sound like it's gonna go down.

00:20:57.705 --> 00:21:00.985
Uh, when it goes down... No!

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:06.387
But when the rollercoaster goes down, that's when generally the fun happens, right?

00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:10.113
It's just going up.

00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:18.358
But it's been, Advent 6 month anniversary and now our birthday too!

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:27.745
But you know, there's also been something very exciting coming around the corner too.

00:21:29.806 --> 00:21:32.408
A certain pink and

00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:36.309
Red holiday perhaps?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:37.770
Yeah!

00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:40.772
Valentine's Day!

00:21:40.892 --> 00:21:41.853
BAU BAU!

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:49.819
And to celebrate it, hololive has released a collection of Valentine's voice packs for 2024!

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.801
BAU BAU!

00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:59.806
And while at FUWAMOCO, we're participating in it along with Advent too!

00:21:59.926 --> 00:22:00.867
Look, Shiori!

00:22:02.728 --> 00:22:05.510
Of course the Watame-senpai.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:11.895
I don't want to lose out to Watame-senpai's fluffiness.

00:22:13.336 --> 00:22:23.664
But, well, Ruffians, you know, doing this voice pack, it was my first time doing something like this and we were really nervous.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:37.640
Even with all the excitement that birthday's going on, we really hope that you'll check them out, listen to them, and maybe accept our feelings too.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.782
I know.

00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:42.905
It was... embarrassing, but...

00:22:46.756 --> 00:22:48.197
I did my best, okay?

00:22:48.217 --> 00:22:49.197
I know!

00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:52.419
We have Japanese and English versions!

00:22:52.820 --> 00:23:01.204
Please definitely look... Look at them!

00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:02.425
Listen to them!

00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:04.126
Look at them with your ears open!

00:23:04.146 --> 00:23:06.887
Look at them with your ears, okay?

00:23:07.188 --> 00:23:09.609
Did we write the scripts?

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.831
Well... I know!

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:20.332
There's a lot of birthday excitement too right now.

00:23:36.795 --> 00:23:43.078
I think we'd really like to be able to hear your response to our Valentine voices too!

00:23:43.278 --> 00:23:43.558
But!

00:23:43.898 --> 00:23:46.319
They'll be available until the beginning of April.

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:47.660
So don't worry, okay?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.361
We'll make sure you don't miss it!

00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:51.301
BAU BAU!

00:23:51.361 --> 00:23:52.662
Thank you, I love you!

00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:53.442
Don't forget though.

00:23:53.842 --> 00:23:54.563
It's my birthday.

00:23:55.303 --> 00:23:56.865
It is my birthday.

00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:58.728
Valentine still has to wake up.

00:23:58.928 --> 00:23:59.889
Wait a few weeks.

00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:01.191
It dies, okay?

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:04.315
So, Mococo's birthday!

00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:05.196
BAU BAU!

00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:08.039
Ruffians!

00:24:12.645 --> 00:24:18.468
It seems like we've received an important FUWAMOCO scoop from our Ruffians!

00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:23.570
Thank you so much, Soyoneko, for the impeccable journalism!

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.150
BAU BAU!

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:38.517
Wow, like I mentioned, you know, this week wasn't just filled with special milestones and anniversaries, but we also had some amazing new outfits from our DP-senpai!

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:39.557
Look!

00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:46.121
La+-senpai revealed her first new outfit!

00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:48.182
An outfit that she designed herself!

00:24:48.282 --> 00:24:49.503
You know it!

00:24:50.203 --> 00:24:51.404
Very very cool!

00:24:51.524 --> 00:24:53.405
Very fitting!

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:57.147
And you know the fire design even moves around!

00:24:58.368 --> 00:24:59.208
Crazy.

00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:00.609
Well, I don't know.

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:03.309
She looks a little grown up now.

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:03.930
Does she?

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.051
Oh, uh, wait.

00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:11.532
Maybe Mofu is- Is that a bit rude to say to a senpai?

00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:14.933
Alright!

00:25:15.653 --> 00:25:19.194
And you can see her tummy now, too.

00:25:19.474 --> 00:25:20.875
Just a bit.

00:25:21.975 --> 00:25:24.076
Don't get tummy empty, okay, Moco-chan?

00:25:28.587 --> 00:25:36.810
Also, Okayu-senpai showed off her special new trial model that she'll be using during her ASMR membership stream!

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.010
It's so cute!

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:48.033
And you know, I, I, I, feel, feel the ears if she's feeling a little bit warm.

00:25:49.554 --> 00:25:52.875
She can, uh, zip down the jacket too.

00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:57.616
So, uh, zip reveals some, uh, cute, uh,

00:26:00.266 --> 00:26:01.926
Under pajamas!

00:26:03.307 --> 00:26:04.067
Pajamas!

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:04.888
Pajamas!

00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:07.069
Under pajamas.

00:26:07.409 --> 00:26:08.649
Pajamas!

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.670
Oh my gosh.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.611
BAU BAU!

00:26:15.652 --> 00:26:18.473
Wow, they're both super cute!

00:26:18.873 --> 00:26:21.114
Congratulations on the new outfit!

00:26:21.214 --> 00:26:23.174
A new model of Senpai!

00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:25.595
Okayu Senpai!

00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:28.796
BAU BAU!

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:29.416
Pajamas!

00:26:33.134 --> 00:26:39.459
Sometimes I feel a bit warm too, but... BAU BAU!

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:53.109
Well, Ruffians, you know, with it being our birthday and everything, obviously Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy have been really excited and wish us a big happy birthday too!

00:26:57.964 --> 00:27:05.810
Actually, Mama Puppy came by quickly with some handmade cakes just like she used to make us!

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.411
BAU BAU!

00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:10.033
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:27:12.094 --> 00:27:14.016
They're super cute, right?

00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:15.598
You know what?

00:27:15.698 --> 00:27:22.324
Mama Puppy was actually sulking a little bit because she said that they didn't turn out as well as she'd hoped.

00:27:22.644 --> 00:27:26.288
They look great, right?

00:27:26.308 --> 00:27:31.373
You know, they sort of look like cupcakes, but they're actually around the size of two cupcakes.

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:32.573
Right!

00:27:32.713 --> 00:27:41.975
Yeah, so we shared my cake together yesterday, and we'll be sharing Moco-chan's cake together later today, right?

00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:42.795
Yeah!

00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:44.816
It was really delicious, though!

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:50.497
The frosting, it wasn't too sweet, and the cake, it was light and fluffy!

00:27:50.897 --> 00:27:54.898
Because, you know, it's my FUWAMOCAKE!

00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:59.299
I hope that, you know, mine's not fuzzy on the inside.

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:00.639
We'll have to see.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:13.927
We feel really really lucky to have such a loving Mama Puppy and papa puppy on top of having you here by our side, Ruffians!

00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:17.350
We're the luckiest puppies ever, huh, Moco-chan?

00:28:18.971 --> 00:28:20.231
BAU BAU!

00:28:23.193 --> 00:28:27.158
Next we have for you, the Doggie of the Day!

00:28:27.198 --> 00:28:31.523
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:33.826
Aria!

00:28:34.287 --> 00:28:36.229
Can you believe it, Ruffians?

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.753
It's Aria's birthday today too!

00:28:39.793 --> 00:28:42.456
Moco-chan has the same birthday.

00:28:43.457 --> 00:28:44.618
Happy birthday, Oryo!

00:28:44.678 --> 00:28:46.419
Happy birthday!

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:49.560
Congrats on your sixth birthday!

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.381
You're just a puppy that's high.

00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:53.162
High.

00:28:53.422 --> 00:28:54.643
I guess, yeah.

00:28:54.703 --> 00:29:00.026
But, you know, she loves napping, so hopefully she won't sleep through it.

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:00.506
I know.

00:29:00.966 --> 00:29:01.667
Definitely not.

00:29:01.727 --> 00:29:03.128
How does Oryo BAU BAU?

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.922
Oh, it's birthday rice on me.

Oryo's birthday!

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.932
And you know, she's been with you for so many birthdays.

00:29:41.952 --> 00:29:43.172
But she's still a puppy.

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:48.695
Yeah, there'll be many more birthdays, many more wonderful memories together.

00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:53.797
And I think I can tell she's looking forward to lots more tweets.

00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:55.317
That's what the face says, huh?

00:29:55.717 --> 00:29:58.498
Yeah, especially those birthday tweets today.

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:02.079
And also even more cuddles from you two.

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:02.819

00:30:55.615 --> 00:30:56.536
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

00:30:57.376 --> 00:30:57.596
Hello!

00:30:58.036 --> 00:31:03.838
I was wondering, was there a specific moment that made you want to join hololive yourselves?

00:31:03.858 --> 00:31:13.460
Or was it something you wanted from the moment you figured out that Akai Hato was not, in fact, a visual novel heroine?

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.121
That's such a good question.

00:31:17.785 --> 00:31:18.225
Wow.

00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:39.392
Well, you know, Haachama-senpai, she helped introduce us into what hololive was, but what really made us want to be a part of the hololive family was just all our talented senpai from all over the world with so many different experiences, talents, and personalities.

00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:45.334
You know, seeing their strength, growth, them working hard all together for their dreams.

00:31:46.917 --> 00:31:49.078
It really resonated with us, you know?

00:31:49.338 --> 00:31:50.798
You know, especially with us.

00:31:50.818 --> 00:31:54.839
We're such hungry puppies too.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.261
Plus, you know, we really, we haven't found our duty yet.

00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:02.422
We haven't found really our place, so...

00:32:03.662 --> 00:32:06.225
We're really, really happy to be here now.

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:08.868
And now we can protect your smiles!

00:32:09.288 --> 00:32:11.210

It couldn't be a big party or anything, right?

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:48.116

00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:50.277

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.161

00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:30.496
I also need you to be there to hold my paw a little bit.

00:33:30.796 --> 00:33:33.498
