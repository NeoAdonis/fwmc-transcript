00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.614
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:17.556
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:21.739
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.862
BAU BAU!

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:28.224
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:28.844 --> 00:05:31.326
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.688
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:35.309
BAU BAU!

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.732
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:42.713
Thank you Ruffians for joining us!

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:43.293
Thank you!

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:46.315
Are you making fun of me?

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:46.875
Huh?

00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:48.136
Are you making fun of me?

00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:48.496
I am.

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:49.536
You're welcome.

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:56.880
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for our 42nd episode today!

00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:59.202
BAU BAU!

00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:00.502
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:01.763
What?

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:03.840
Spit it out!

00:06:05.261 --> 00:06:11.584
I see a number of new Ruffians.

00:06:11.824 --> 00:06:14.566
Thank you new Ruffians and thank you all Ruffians.

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:17.067
Just for them.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:18.268
Not all Ruffians.

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:19.389
Is that how it is?

00:06:23.757 --> 00:06:25.218
Just for the new Ruffians.

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:29.382
I'll explain what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.263
Old Ruffians, don't complain.

00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:32.724
You know what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

00:06:32.744 --> 00:06:33.785
Close your ears, okay?

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:35.206
Close your ears!

00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:42.712
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:43.633
A.K.A.

00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:44.874
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:46.756
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.837
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:54.621
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:55.802
Not the left paw.

00:06:56.402 --> 00:06:57.283
Right paw.

00:06:57.863 --> 00:07:04.108
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:08.491
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.252
BAU BAU!

00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:11.933
Are you awake?

00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:13.411
I'm awake.

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:16.112
You were asking me, huh?

00:07:16.232 --> 00:07:16.732
I wasn't.

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:19.233
I was asking the Ruffians, but thank you for your input.

00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:24.214
Ruffians, did you see Pero by any chance?

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:24.894
Yeah, again.

00:07:24.914 --> 00:07:29.395
I think there was another Pero Sighting.

00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:32.436
This time he is... De-den!

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:41.810
This picture has impact!

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.391
Wait, was your train being delayed by Pero?

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.432
That's not very nice of him.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:57.399
But, Moco-chan, I have a feeling you know that maybe it wasn't Pero's idea to get tied up and find an inconvenient place to lay down for a nap.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.079
Why?

00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:02.508
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:06.512
It's okay, Pero can still fly, but what if he's tied up like this?

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:07.273
He can't fly.

00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:09.135
His rope is binding him.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:11.297
I don't know.

00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:17.442
I guess maybe it could be that he wanted to get up and close to the train.

00:08:18.283 --> 00:08:23.044
You know, it does look like a very classic train with all that steam and smoke.

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:23.725
True, true.

00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:27.406
I think maybe he's just being a bit... He's being a bit silly.

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.386
He's just being a bit dramatic, you know.

00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:29.887
Silly?

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:33.348
If you look closely, the train isn't even moving, okay?

00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:33.928
True.

00:08:33.968 --> 00:08:35.208
He's not in harm's way.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:35.928
He's fine.

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:37.269
I guess.

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:38.889
Yeah, he just wanted to see it close.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.330
I guess.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.691
But I think it'd be really cool to go on a ride on this train, you know?

00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:46.292
I wonder what it'd feel like, what it'd smell like.

00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:51.094
You could probably smell the ancestors coming from it, right?

00:08:51.174 --> 00:08:52.214
All the perfume.

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:57.217
Interesting experience.

00:08:58.377 --> 00:09:00.878
Sorry about Pero getting in the way there.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:05.280
But did anyone untie him in the end?

00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:12.804
We'll have to see if maybe Pero's gonna be here again next week.

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:14.385
Maybe?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.502
BAU BAU!

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:20.023
Hopefully not.

00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:21.044
Hopefully not.

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:21.744
He's good.

00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:23.405
I don't know.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:24.606
I'm a little bit concerned.

00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:26.948
Maybe that's the end of the Pero Sighting corner?

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:28.429
He's good.

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:31.171
But we have happy news!

00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.532
Happy news!

00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:35.574
Wow, Ruffians.

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:39.514
You remember what happened at the end of October, right?

00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:41.656
A lot of stuff happened at the end of October, but... I did.

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:43.797
Maybe it's not fair to ask that question.

00:09:44.137 --> 00:09:44.677
Wow.

00:09:44.697 --> 00:09:47.919
At the end of October, FUWAMOCO!

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:52.822
We uploaded our second cover song, "Cute na Kanojo"!

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:54.603
Ruffians, you had a look, right?

00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:55.704
I listened.

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:56.364
I think you did.

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:57.405
You used your ears for that.

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:05.549
Thank you so much for the warm reception despite, you know, it being a little bit of a creepy song.

00:10:06.786 --> 00:10:10.868
Thanks to you Ruffians, it now has over 250k views!

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.490
Thank you!

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.971
BAU BAU!

00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:18.592
Thank you so much Ruffians!

00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:22.174
It really makes us happy that you enjoy our singing and our music so much!

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:27.747
We can't wait to record even more songs!

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:33.170
Despite sometimes how tricky and time consuming it can be.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.211
It's a surprise for us and for you!

00:10:35.992 --> 00:10:37.192
We couldn't do our best.

00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:43.296
You know we want to be able to show you the Twin Guard Dog idols FUWAMOCO too, right?

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:46.198
And you know, lots of different sides to us as well.

00:10:46.218 --> 00:10:48.479
So we'll continue to do our best!

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:51.061
This is the sound an idol makes, right?

00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:51.701
Right!

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:52.762
Right!

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:59.791
You know you're a true idol when you can make that sound, okay?

00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:01.432
Okay.

00:11:01.442 --> 00:11:02.632
3, 2, 1.

00:11:02.693 --> 00:11:05.795
It sounds like a drill.

00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:07.777
Exactly.

00:11:08.297 --> 00:11:10.619
We're the Twin Guard Dog Drills.

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:12.460
That's strong.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.202
Nobody can stop our drill!

00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:14.302
Yeah.

00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:21.105
BAU BAU!

00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:27.146
When we record the cover songs, I promise it won't have any of those sounds in it, okay?

00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:27.987
I guess.

00:11:28.027 --> 00:11:29.967
But is that what the Ruffians want?

00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:32.027
Is that what the Ruffians want?

00:11:32.047 --> 00:11:33.788
What if they want the drill sounds?

00:11:33.828 --> 00:11:34.468
Maybe.

00:11:34.488 --> 00:11:38.428
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:40.569
Do your best power washing sound.

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:40.859
3, 2, 1!

00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:44.089
What's this power washing sound like?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:56.467
It has to have more of a water sound, Moco-chan.

00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:57.628
That's not very violent.

00:11:57.708 --> 00:11:58.729
That's like a fountain.

00:11:58.749 --> 00:11:59.750
I don't know it.

00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:03.163
What does power washing sound like?

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:04.623
I'll have to ask Pony-senpai.

00:12:04.643 --> 00:12:06.944
We have to study a little bit.

00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:09.785
BAU BAU!

00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:11.065
Please look forward to it.

00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:13.946
Whatever song we have next that doesn't have drilling in it.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.887
Or power washing.

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:18.247
BAU BAU!

00:12:18.887 --> 00:12:21.348
Well, there's more FUWAMOCO news!

00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:22.789
Ruffians!

00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:25.950
Did you happen to not get much sleep?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.832
What type of question is that, huh?

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:35.853
Well, maybe your morning has also been connected to night time.

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:39.155
You might know what we're gonna mention, huh?

00:12:39.915 --> 00:12:43.856
Poruru-oneechan celebrated her 3rd anniversary with a 3D Live!

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:45.917
BAU BAU!

00:12:46.017 --> 00:12:49.298
Congratulations, Poruru-oneechan!

00:12:49.338 --> 00:12:50.679
Were you able to watch Ruffians?

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:52.780
You didn't sleep much.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.584
FUWAMOCO, we were going to try in real time, but we just had to get some sleep.

00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:01.265
We tried though.

00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:05.908
We tried to do homework and stay up, but uh-uh.

00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:07.429
BAU BAU.

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:14.473
But if you did, you might have noticed a song that we also recently sung during one of our walk-in-room parties.

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:16.174
Did you notice?

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.297
Kurenai!

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:19.658
BAU BAU!

00:13:19.898 --> 00:13:22.841
It was a really fun performance, so make sure you check it out.

00:13:22.881 --> 00:13:23.561
K-Ruffians!

00:13:25.923 --> 00:13:33.650
We also really enjoyed her original song, Persona, as well as the collab for Summer Night Time with Aki-senpai and Ren-senpai!

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.851
I felt their voices worked so well for it.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:44.043
We really really enjoyed her last song, the Nanto Sekai Kou ni Hikikomori!

00:13:44.504 --> 00:13:46.705
Hikikomori, I kind of messed up.

00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:47.186
Right!

00:13:47.706 --> 00:13:48.687
Dampakumi.

00:13:48.847 --> 00:13:50.729
And it worked really well for you!

00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:52.630
It's a strong voice and high energy too!

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.631
Right, it was perfect.

00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:57.736
It's always such a treat, FWN3D.

00:13:57.756 --> 00:14:01.099
Please check it out all three of them, even if you couldn't check it live.

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:07.447
You know, you can still watch the archive, right?

00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:07.867
Yeah, yeah!

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:08.889
Happy 3rd Anniversary, FWN3D!

00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:09.289
BAU BAU!

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.761
That was good.

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:17.143
I wish we could've stayed up.

00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:18.484
BAU BAU.

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:19.244
We did our best.

00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:20.185
We did our best.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:22.966
Not quite enough.

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.548
Wow, Ruffians.

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:26.929
Guess what!

00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:28.030
Guess what!

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.731
Guess what!

00:14:31.372 --> 00:14:32.813
I actually wanted to kill the Ruffians.

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:33.433
Guess it!

00:14:34.854 --> 00:14:35.434
Guess it!

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:40.777
Now you're making demands of them this early in the morning.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:41.058
I am.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.893
There's been... There's been... No!

00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:54.086
No misunderstandings.

00:14:54.557 --> 00:14:55.277
Why, Moco-chan?

00:14:55.698 --> 00:14:58.319
YOU MISUNDERSTANDING!

00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.579
I'm scared.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.200
I'm scared.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.801
BAU BAU!

00:15:03.901 --> 00:15:07.063
BAU BAU!

00:15:07.603 --> 00:15:10.784
Why is it that you always get sad, Ruffians?

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.605
It's a good thing.

00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:14.006
It's a good thing.

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:14.526
Why?

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:14.606
Why?

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:15.226
Why?

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:21.189
You know, we... FUWAMOCO, we're always saying silly things by accident.

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:22.250
They get misunderstood.

00:15:23.564 --> 00:15:25.165
It's a bad trait of ours.

00:15:26.005 --> 00:15:26.645
I know.

00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:27.966
Really?

00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:29.306
Really?

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:32.067
Don't ever mean to say weird things, okay?

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:34.088
We were on purpose.

00:15:34.948 --> 00:15:36.469
Don't misunderstand, okay?

00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:39.910
Yeah, but... You understand, right?

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.252
Moco-chan, after three months... Maybe we're getting better.

00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:47.993
Maybe.

00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:49.874
What do you think?

00:15:50.554 --> 00:15:51.394
Are we getting better?

00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:51.574
What?

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:57.171
Is it more that we're just getting better at forgetting them?

00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:00.352
Forgetting them or just not noticing them?

00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:05.795
Maybe not forgetting them, but just conveniently avoiding them.

00:16:06.095 --> 00:16:08.496
Conveniently avoiding them, maybe?

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:11.157
You're getting better at forgetting!

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:16.420
Getting worse at noticing them.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.560
You're getting used to them.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.581
Maybe.

00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:20.041
Maybe that's the truth.

00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.182
I don't think it's the truth.

00:16:22.334 --> 00:16:24.335
You've become excellent forgetters.

00:16:25.395 --> 00:16:26.576
I think that's a good treat.

00:16:27.356 --> 00:16:27.896
Forgetting?

00:16:28.596 --> 00:16:28.956
Really?

00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:30.617
Sometimes.

00:16:31.437 --> 00:16:31.997
In this case.

00:16:32.517 --> 00:16:36.419
I prefer to remember every moment with the Ruffians, but... True.

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:38.700
But this is okay to forget.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.660
This one, yeah.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.480
It's better for you.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.700
Yeah.

00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:42.841
You don't know!

00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:45.922
I don't know.

00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:47.142
I'm getting fluffier.

00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:49.063
Does that mean I'm getting fuzzier?

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:54.555
You don't mean like fluffier and the getting fluffier for winter kind of way, do you?

00:16:54.575 --> 00:16:57.577
Do you?!

00:16:57.937 --> 00:17:00.579
It's important to not misunderstand.

00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:02.700
Don't misunderstand.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.340
Got it.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.151
BAU BAU!

00:17:06.571 --> 00:17:07.551
Good job, FUWAMOCO.

00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:09.732
It's what you're supposed to say now, okay, Ruffians?

00:17:09.952 --> 00:17:10.792
Just so you know.

00:17:10.992 --> 00:17:24.037
Well, Ruffians, you know... We all know that this weekend, this upcoming weekend, it's going to be a little different than most, you know.

00:17:24.097 --> 00:17:28.978
FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be focusing on getting some important homework done.

00:17:29.479 --> 00:17:30.399
Which means, you know...

00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:35.472
It'll be a little strange since we won't be able to see each other for quite a while.

00:17:35.872 --> 00:17:37.253
A weekend, right?

00:17:37.353 --> 00:17:38.134
A couple days.

00:17:38.674 --> 00:17:39.095
Maybe.

00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:40.376
Maybe!

00:17:40.396 --> 00:17:46.540
But, but, you know, we thought... We thought because it might be a little rough...

00:17:53.462 --> 00:17:58.825
We do a Twitterspace!

00:17:58.885 --> 00:18:00.446
BAU BAU!

00:18:01.426 --> 00:18:03.447
A Twitterspace, another Twitterspace.

00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:04.888
Our second Twitterspace.

00:18:05.028 --> 00:18:05.348
Good!

00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:09.411
Especially since things might be getting a bit messy again.

00:18:10.571 --> 00:18:15.095
We'll chit-chat together while tidying up all the fluff and fries, okay?

00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:16.316
That means you have to too.

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:23.402
This base will happen on Sunday the 12th at 1pm PT and 6am JST.

00:18:23.422 --> 00:18:25.324
That'll be the 13th JST.

00:18:26.665 --> 00:18:31.790
We'll be looking at your comments in the live chat that will open temporarily on YouTube.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.172
Yeah, on YouTube, by following FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:18:35.212 --> 00:18:38.414
So, FUWAMOCO Morning's live chat will open for a bit.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:42.036
For a bit, and then it'll go goodbye for a little while.

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:45.418
We hope that you'll join us for a bit more time that we can spend together.

00:18:45.438 --> 00:18:48.800
After that, we'll go straight back to our homework.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.241
Straight back to it, yeah.

00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:51.482
Got it.

00:18:52.062 --> 00:18:52.983
So early!

00:18:53.003 --> 00:18:57.866
It's a little bit early, but you know, that way, you know, the day is still kind of...

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.288
In the swing of things!

00:19:00.729 --> 00:19:02.291
And I'll be all tiny!

00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:03.172
No, I'll be FINE!

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:06.357
There it is.

00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:11.464
Oh my gosh, that's the hundredth sneeze.

00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:16.338
I don't know how to feel right now.

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:19.660
Congratulations, Ruffians!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.062
Congratulations, Ruffians!

00:19:23.122 --> 00:19:23.842
BAU BAU!

00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:29.325
The 42nd FUWAMOCO Morning and the private sneeze!

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:39.408
BAU BAU!

00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:42.989
I wasn't expecting to sneeze today.

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:45.609
You have to ask me for my commentary, okay?

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:49.110
Moco-chan, how does it feel to sneeze 100 times within 3 months?

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:55.131
Well, I feel like now I'm so famous, everyone noses me for my sneezing.

00:19:55.352 --> 00:20:01.053
And now I'm very famous, well known for my sneezing.

00:20:07.254 --> 00:20:11.255
Although it seems, Ruffians, that all those sneezes have gone to her head.

00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.215
It's gone to my head!

00:20:12.655 --> 00:20:14.476
They've gone to my sinuses!

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:17.636
Everyone noses me from my sinuses!

00:20:18.376 --> 00:20:18.596
Yes.

00:20:19.037 --> 00:20:23.537
Well, Moco-chan, do you have any ideas for, you know, maybe a tissue line?

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:25.198
Or a nasal spray?

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:25.878
I'm waiting.

00:20:26.078 --> 00:20:27.738
I'm waiting for your messages.

00:20:28.238 --> 00:20:29.799
For the contacts.

00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:30.239
Okay.

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:34.742
You can, you can phone us at the hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:20:35.643 --> 00:20:37.264
Yeah, yeah!

00:20:37.364 --> 00:20:40.407
Phone us at the hashtag, okay?

00:20:40.867 --> 00:20:43.309
I can, I can do that stuff.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.351
I can say this is amazing.

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:46.051
Yeah.

00:20:46.632 --> 00:20:51.095
So make sure to show the tissues are the strongest ever tissues.

00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:52.016
Strongest tissues!

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:52.917
Nothing can break them!

00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:53.978
Smell like roses!

00:20:54.038 --> 00:20:55.379
Cute patterns!

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:55.699
Little dogs!

00:20:58.381 --> 00:21:01.943
Rather than smelling like roses, it'd be better if they're Mococo-scented, no?

00:21:04.725 --> 00:21:06.546
Are you saying that roses don't smell like me?

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:09.008
I guess I'll have to take a good smell later, huh?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.131
We are celebrating!

00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:16.893
Thank you, number one sneezing Moco-chan!

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:18.914
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:21:19.014 --> 00:21:20.795
Thank you for the main voice!

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:23.557
BAU BAU!

00:21:26.794 --> 00:21:32.983
I think that I will likely continue my sneeze record whether I want to or not.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.662
We look forward to it, Moco-chan.

00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:38.863
We look forward to it.

00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:39.684
Do you.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.506
Now continuing with FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:43.767
Back to regular programming.

00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:45.168
I'm sorry for the interruption.

00:21:45.188 --> 00:21:50.211
It was a very important news update.

00:21:50.512 --> 00:21:54.655
Live news breaking right now, sneezing into your heart.

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:55.635
Yes.

00:21:55.655 --> 00:21:56.796
Sneezing into your heart.

00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:59.118
Beautiful, beautiful Moco-chan here.

00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:00.993
We're all Ruffians!

00:22:01.493 --> 00:22:06.496
We hope that you'll join us for a new interface on Sunday the 12th at 1pm PT.

00:22:07.337 --> 00:22:10.299
That way we can all kind of tidy up the fluff and the fuzz.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.720
You know?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.562
And maybe, maybe Moco-chan will sneeze too.

00:22:15.362 --> 00:22:15.803
Likely.

00:22:16.063 --> 00:22:16.463
Likely.

00:22:18.271 --> 00:22:18.952
Thank you!

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:24.467
Moco-chan!

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:32.253
You gave the Ruffians some homework doing your Pup Talk on Wednesday, right?

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:33.574
I did, but it wasn't that serious.

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:36.216
Well, maybe Ruffians, you know what?

00:22:36.476 --> 00:22:40.039
Maybe one day you just couldn't wake up in time doing Moco-chan's Pup Talk.

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:50.152
And if you weren't able to get your homework done yet, you still can!

00:23:13.847 --> 00:23:15.189
There's no dead one.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.632
You could even do it over and over if you wanted to.

00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:21.775
It made us really happy.

00:23:21.955 --> 00:23:24.017
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:27.781
But you know, we know that life is busy, it's rough too.

00:23:28.161 --> 00:23:32.506
So I don't think Moco-chan, you won't be giving any more homework from here on, right?

00:23:32.606 --> 00:23:35.709
You can't copy, you have to do your own homework, okay?

00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:37.150
You have to, yeah.

00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:43.214
But yeah, we're sure you know, but we also have our own homework to get done!

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:48.677
And we're gonna do our best to get it done to the best we can!

00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:50.378
And as quickly as we can.

00:23:50.398 --> 00:23:50.979
And quickly.

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:51.819
Yeah.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:52.960
Not perfect.

00:23:53.581 --> 00:23:54.041
Just done.

00:23:54.421 --> 00:23:55.722
Done, you know.

00:23:55.762 --> 00:23:59.183
We'll do it for you, Ruffians, but also ourselves too, you know.

00:23:59.203 --> 00:24:00.643
And that's what's important, you know.

00:24:01.003 --> 00:24:06.645
That way, we can all enjoy a bunch of really cool things together!

00:24:06.785 --> 00:24:08.786
Let's do it, okay, Ruffians?

00:24:08.966 --> 00:24:09.526
Okay!

00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:09.946
BAU BAU!

00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:13.048
BAU BAU!

00:24:13.548 --> 00:24:24.676
Well, you know, this month's theme is balance, so we're trying to get some more balance into FWM and get it closer to the golden time of 20 minutes long.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.858
So let's go straight to our regular corners, Moco-chan!

00:24:28.018 --> 00:24:28.738
Okay!

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:32.421
We have a Doggie of the Day.

00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:34.282
Today we have...

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:39.654
Kalani as Doggie of the Day!

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.260
Great shape.

00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:48.904
She enjoys sunbathing and patrolling the neighborhood to chase down the postal worker.

00:24:48.944 --> 00:24:50.165
Very diligent.

00:24:50.265 --> 00:24:51.345
Hardworking.

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:53.847
Double cute!

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:56.409
She looks like she's taking such a good nap.

00:24:56.829 --> 00:25:01.972
We'll be careful not to look too closely or we'll all start feeling sleepy again, right?

00:25:02.052 --> 00:25:03.353
This is FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:04.854
Not FUWAMOCO Nap.

00:25:05.034 --> 00:25:05.874
Okay.

00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:09.937
Is it okay if I just kinda cuddle up right around your neck there?

00:25:10.983 --> 00:25:13.024
I love the paw pillow.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:15.425
The paw pillow, right?

00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:18.267
How does Kalani BAU BAU?

00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:22.349
I think it has to be pretty scary and big.

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:24.310
You know, to scare off the postal workers.

00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:29.199
Pretty traditional. Well, you know...

00:25:43.973 --> 00:25:47.356
Today, this month, the theme is balance and it's Kalani!

00:25:47.376 --> 00:25:50.598
Kalani enjoys a pretty balanced life, you know?

00:25:51.239 --> 00:25:55.302
Naps, sunbathing, chasing off strange postal records.

00:25:55.362 --> 00:25:56.803
It's important, you know?

00:25:57.703 --> 00:25:59.985
It's sleep, relaxation, exercise.

00:26:00.085 --> 00:26:03.228
Right, it's the best doggy life one could wish for, right?

00:26:03.268 --> 00:26:03.848
Exactly!

00:26:04.148 --> 00:26:09.813
You know, especially so close beside an owner who loves her just as much as she loves them.

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.114
Kalani has the idea.

00:26:13.334 --> 00:26:14.355
Of course.

00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:18.336
I can't help but be a bit envious, right?

00:26:18.636 --> 00:26:20.757
You know, Moco-chan, we have an important duty.

00:26:20.777 --> 00:26:21.798
Important job.

00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:23.998
Yeah, to protect every Ruffian smile.

00:26:24.038 --> 00:26:24.839
Yeah!

00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:28.080
BAU BAU!

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.621
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:26:31.682 --> 00:26:33.762
We have... De-den!

00:26:38.829 --> 00:26:40.150
Did you really take this?

00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:41.692
It's so fluffy.

00:26:41.712 --> 00:26:42.713
It's so fuzzy.

00:26:42.773 --> 00:26:44.974
It's so beautiful.

00:26:45.495 --> 00:26:46.816
It's not fair.

00:26:47.196 --> 00:26:50.860
The first thing I thought is that I want to play hide-and-go-seek in them.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.001
You know, it's just so fuzzy here.

00:26:53.822 --> 00:26:55.083
Would you come look for us?

00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:57.665
Even if you're allergic.

00:26:57.946 --> 00:26:58.706
Even if.

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:01.569
Even if you sneeze a lot, would you come look for us?

00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:05.046
Why is it so beautiful though?

00:27:05.727 --> 00:27:08.288
I've never quite seen a sight like this in the Northwest.

00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:08.688
Right!

00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:11.009
I want to see them all blow in the wind.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.410
Cute.

00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:15.331
Oh, you think about it, Moco-chan.

00:27:15.371 --> 00:27:18.493
We're kind of the pampas grass color too, right?

00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:19.814
Maybe.

00:27:19.874 --> 00:27:20.974
We'll be blending in good.

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.035
It looks the same.

00:27:25.826 --> 00:27:28.388
Thank you for sharing this with us today!

00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:28.788
BAU BAU!

00:27:28.808 --> 00:27:31.730
Yeah, fuzzy grass, right?

00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:33.051
It's mine.

00:27:35.233 --> 00:27:36.293
So pretty.

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:40.556
And for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:27:41.017 --> 00:27:46.641
FUWAMOCO have hinted before that the reason you work so hard is because of how hungry you are.

00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:49.983
Where does our hunger come from?

00:27:50.003 --> 00:27:51.883
How do you say hungry?

00:27:52.444 --> 00:27:53.064
Stay hungry.

00:27:53.164 --> 00:27:54.124
I said stay hungry.

00:27:54.745 --> 00:27:55.865
How do you say hungry?

00:27:55.885 --> 00:27:58.486
Where does our hunger come from?

00:27:58.526 --> 00:27:59.306
Good question.

00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:03.348
Probably passion.

00:28:03.888 --> 00:28:04.709
Foolishness.

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.649
And pain.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:07.470
Probably.

00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:11.240
I don't know, we're used to being told no on things.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:19.488
But we think an important part of the journey overall, and like our creative process, is to try to figure out how we can change that no into yes.

00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:20.109
I know.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.552
Sometimes it's just not possible, but...

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.110
Why not try?

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.251
Right!

00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:31.975
Yeah, we understand, you know, that we're rather silly for being this hungry, and maybe it doesn't make sense at times.

00:28:32.035 --> 00:28:35.918
Maybe we'd be better, maybe easier if we weren't this hungry.

00:28:36.118 --> 00:28:38.199
But what is with the pondering?

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.321
We can't help it, Ruffians!

00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:42.302
We are!

00:28:42.682 --> 00:28:46.945
You know, we make it difficult for ourselves too, and we understand this as well.

00:28:46.965 --> 00:28:48.206
Yeah, we could make it easier.

00:28:48.906 --> 00:28:49.366
But we don't.

00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:55.862
Also, guard dog training was really hard on us, so sometimes it was even painful.

00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:59.795
So, it's that pain that keeps us driven to go forward too.

00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:04.999
Cuz you know, if we give up now, then those painful memories will just continue to stay that.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.003
If we continue, there could be more pain.

00:29:09.323 --> 00:29:14.548
But if we give up, I feel like that would just hurt even more, right?

00:29:15.268 --> 00:29:16.389
So we continue!

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.111
Because we're not done.

00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:21.234
Our hunger just grows!

00:29:21.734 --> 00:29:22.615
Multiplies!

00:29:23.035 --> 00:29:23.376
BAU BAU!

00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:35.517
Probably not.

00:29:36.137 --> 00:29:36.758
But it's okay.

00:29:37.078 --> 00:29:39.359
But that's who FUWAMOCO is, right?

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:41.400
It could be easier.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.040
We don't want to make it easier.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.922
BAU BAU!

00:29:46.082 --> 00:29:52.364
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

00:29:52.504 --> 00:30:00.708
Please continue to submit your Doggy of the Days, you know, your questions, your Pero Sightings, your walks, even though it's cold.

00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:02.569
And don't forget to use the hashtag

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:05.371
FWMC Morning oki!

00:30:05.952 --> 00:30:07.813
Now for our next stream!

00:30:08.694 --> 00:30:18.683
We have... Well, we have a very comfy evening tonight because all together with Abbot, we're gonna be having a movie night!

00:30:18.703 --> 00:30:18.863
Yeah!

00:30:18.903 --> 00:30:19.724
Watch it all!

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:23.467
Over on Nerissa's channel, we're watching her movie pick this month.

00:30:23.908 --> 00:30:27.611
It's the Princess and the Pauper Barbie movie.

00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:28.372
The Pauper.

00:30:29.092 --> 00:30:30.773
Princess and the Pauper Barbie Movie.

00:30:31.294 --> 00:30:31.914
It's hard to say.

00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:32.435
Yeah.

00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:38.859
FUWAMOCO, we've never seen a Barbie movie before, so we're not too sure what to expect.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.821
But Nerissa really likes it!

00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:42.962
And we really like Nerissa!

00:30:43.223 --> 00:30:45.084
So we're looking forward to it!

00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:47.766
But we hope you'll join us, Ruffians!

00:30:48.586 --> 00:30:49.447
Don't forget, right?

00:30:49.827 --> 00:30:51.348
The Princess and the Pauper.

00:30:51.408 --> 00:30:52.529
No, the Pauper.

00:30:54.113 --> 00:30:54.873
BAU BAU!

00:30:55.254 --> 00:31:06.398
If we take another peek at our schedule, you'll see, you know, this weekend's a little bit different.

00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:07.739
It's a bit different.

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:12.181
But, you know, we're going to focus really hard on our homework.

00:31:12.241 --> 00:31:14.002
Hopefully we can get through most of it.

00:31:14.362 --> 00:31:16.703
If not all of it, hopefully quite a bit though.

00:31:17.003 --> 00:31:19.805
I really hope we got it, can I still do it?

00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:26.208
But we'll also be there for the rebroadcasting of our Unarmed Archive Karaoke from our debut month.

00:31:26.528 --> 00:31:29.310
Our debut month, that was quite a while ago.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.691
We hope you'll be there for it, Ruffians.

00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:36.994
And we'll also be sharing our new schedule afterwards, so we think you should be there for it.

00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:38.615
BAU BAU!

00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:47.512
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us for our second FWMCM!

00:31:47.752 --> 00:31:51.274
And the 100th sneeze!

00:31:51.494 --> 00:31:56.097
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:31:56.117 --> 00:32:02.621
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:32:03.261 --> 00:32:04.482
