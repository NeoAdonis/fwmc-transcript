05:11.121 --> 05:13.623
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:14.164 --> 05:17.687
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.707 --> 05:19.948
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:24.243 --> 05:29.226
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:29.346 --> 05:31.728
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:32.028 --> 05:34.910
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:35.010 --> 05:36.431
BAU BAU BAU!

05:36.891 --> 05:40.854
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.234 --> 05:44.977
Thank you for joining us today for our 25th episode!

05:50.377 --> 05:52.520
I thought you were going to say that's a critical number.

05:52.981 --> 05:55.844
It is a critical number too!

05:56.065 --> 05:57.366
It's 25 Ruffians!

05:57.446 --> 05:59.529
BAU BAU!

05:59.589 --> 06:01.612
Thank you!

06:02.052 --> 06:04.035
Wow for Ruffians that are joining us today for

06:04.435 --> 06:12.038
Maybe the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:12.858 --> 06:14.038
AKA FUWAMUKO!

06:14.058 --> 06:15.079
Get it?

06:15.479 --> 06:17.960
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMUKO!

06:18.140 --> 06:23.882
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:25.322 --> 06:31.828
Ruffians, if you could please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:31.848 --> 06:33.350
It would make us really happy.

06:33.390 --> 06:38.135
Yeah, let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:38.515 --> 06:40.297
BAU BAU!

06:41.698 --> 06:42.699
What's wrong, Moco-chan?

06:42.719 --> 06:47.464
Did you not like it when I said the thing you were gonna say at the same time?

06:49.961 --> 06:51.662
I was gonna say that this time.

06:52.523 --> 06:54.244
Which one do you like more, Ruffians?

06:54.264 --> 06:54.904
Do you think it's better?

06:54.924 --> 06:55.405
Together or...

07:05.226 --> 07:08.869
Did I steal Moco-chan's thunder?

07:09.609 --> 07:09.969
Stupid.

07:09.989 --> 07:10.530
Stupid.

07:10.650 --> 07:11.150
Stupid.

07:11.651 --> 07:13.092
Together.

07:13.172 --> 07:14.733
I guess I'm not angry.

07:15.593 --> 07:17.134
If the Ruffians like it then.

07:17.254 --> 07:19.956
It's too early for anger, Moco-chan.

07:20.096 --> 07:21.617
That's true.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.519
Before I get more angry.

07:24.539 --> 07:27.882
Do any Ruffians happen to see Peron?

07:29.643 --> 07:30.423
Let's see!

07:30.584 --> 07:31.884
De-den!

07:36.579 --> 07:40.805
That looks like Pero's been spotted with a new friend!

07:40.865 --> 07:43.288
With a Ruffian's pet turtle!

07:43.488 --> 07:49.496
Hopefully Pero's being a good influence on your friend.

07:50.552 --> 07:52.053
I don't know, Moco-chan.

07:52.253 --> 07:56.515
You can, like, uh... Turtles... can take the shells, right?

07:56.575 --> 07:58.476
Pero's not gonna do something like that, right?

07:58.516 --> 08:01.837
Do you have to be a good enough friend to take a turtle's shell?

08:02.337 --> 08:02.777
I don't know.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.678
Can't you take it by force?

08:05.058 --> 08:06.379
What if Pero tries that?

08:07.579 --> 08:08.100
I don't know.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.461
He can be sort of nasty sometimes, you know?

08:10.981 --> 08:18.704
So if he feels, like... a bit jealous of the shell, thinks it's justified, then maybe he'll do what he can to get his own way, you know?

08:18.784 --> 08:18.944
Yeah...

08:20.848 --> 08:23.529
But if he's truly a friend then he shouldn't, right?

08:25.029 --> 08:34.771
But you know, I feel like... I feel a bit... It's nice that Pero can make new friends, you know?

08:35.151 --> 08:39.712
And you know, a friend that has a warm and protective shell sounds pretty nice.

08:40.092 --> 08:41.332
True, you know?

08:41.452 --> 08:42.332
I would like that.

08:42.353 --> 08:45.153
You can retreat into it whenever you need it.

08:45.253 --> 08:46.533
Sounds pretty comfy, huh?

08:47.514 --> 08:49.194
Could be good, it could be good.

08:50.057 --> 08:51.258
I don't know, maybe.

08:51.919 --> 08:55.181
Maybe it would be a good idea to keep a close eye on Perroccino.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.402
He goes on his own way.

08:57.263 --> 08:59.845
Or shells can't be removed from a turtle.

09:00.045 --> 09:00.566
They can't?

09:03.028 --> 09:10.174
It seems that we don't have much information about turtles, FUWAMOCO-chan.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.436
Well then, your friend is safe.

09:13.196 --> 09:13.417
Maybe.

09:14.662 --> 09:23.448
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe... Well, you know... Yeah, Pero should go away soon.

09:23.849 --> 09:26.591
As long as maybe you're not feeding a turtle pudding.

09:28.192 --> 09:33.416
Turtles eat vegetables and... I could imagine a turtle eating pudding.

09:34.376 --> 09:36.398
But can they eat sugary desserts?

09:38.005 --> 09:39.947
Uh, veggies have sugars in them too.

09:40.147 --> 09:40.908
They do.

09:41.468 --> 09:42.349
Maybe some more.

09:42.729 --> 09:45.111
Maybe don't feed the turtle pudding though.

09:45.891 --> 09:46.772
Keep Pero away.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.293
BAU BAU!

09:48.333 --> 09:49.795
BAU BAU!

09:49.895 --> 09:53.377
Ruffians, please let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

09:53.397 --> 09:57.040
You can let us know with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

09:57.080 --> 09:57.581
BAU BAU!

09:58.101 --> 10:00.003
BAU BAU!

10:00.643 --> 10:03.946
Now, I think some Ruffians might have noticed, but

10:06.364 --> 10:10.266
It's one month since membership opened!

10:10.306 --> 10:13.668
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

10:13.708 --> 10:17.490
It's one month since Doggy Pack.

10:18.171 --> 10:20.552
How did time go so fast, right?

10:20.652 --> 10:24.694
And you know, today's also our 25th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

10:24.714 --> 10:26.876
Yeah, it's double special, right?

10:27.456 --> 10:30.258
Thank you so much for watching for all years and more.

10:31.318 --> 10:37.124
And thank you for wanting to be a special part of a special doggy pack too.

10:37.164 --> 10:38.386
BAU BAU!

10:38.566 --> 10:40.908
You know it!

10:41.108 --> 10:49.037
The other day, we also uploaded a very special video for the doggy pack, so make sure you check it out, okay?

10:49.097 --> 10:50.118
I didn't think it was that.

10:51.141 --> 10:51.881
You know what?

11:13.469 --> 11:19.671
We're gonna be playing Fall Guys together on Saturday, too!

11:20.832 --> 11:31.936
You know, Fall Guys is free, so that means all you need to do is just download it beforehand and you can join and hopefully play with us, so even if you've never played before...

11:35.759 --> 11:35.939
Enough!

11:54.730 --> 12:01.134
As for other things that we're going to do with the doggy pack, we'd really, really, really like to do a watch-along soon.

12:01.594 --> 12:06.617
But the one thing that's making it a little bit tricky is that we can't decide.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.219
We can't decide on what to watch.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.180
It's a tough one.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.090
We'll continue thinking.

12:16.631 --> 12:19.531
Thank you so much for being here!

12:19.871 --> 12:22.992
Thank you for supporting us on this journey!

12:23.412 --> 12:26.913
BAU BAU!

12:27.513 --> 12:29.053
Extra happy time.

12:29.973 --> 12:34.014
Now, this is a little... Is this not a story?

12:34.674 --> 12:42.376
Ruffians... We actually got a phone call the other day, but... FUWAMOCO...

12:43.715 --> 12:46.436
We're really, really bad with phone calls.

12:48.076 --> 12:48.716
Are you?

12:48.736 --> 12:51.637
Ruffians, what do you do when you get a phone call?

12:51.977 --> 12:53.018
You answer it.

12:55.078 --> 12:55.878
Answer the phone?

12:55.918 --> 12:59.580
But... But... You don't know who's gonna be on the other side, right?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.740
Ignore it.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.620
Ignore it.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.321
See, that's what we do.

13:04.521 --> 13:09.162
Yeah, we almost never ever answer them because it's just... It's too scary.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.283
But... It's angry, you know?

13:11.403 --> 13:11.663
Yeah.

13:12.063 --> 13:17.226
But actually, this one... This one was from Mama Puppy!

13:17.266 --> 13:19.467
Yeah, we got a phone call from Mama Puppy.

13:19.928 --> 13:23.470
And this time, she said she had something to share with us.

13:23.650 --> 13:25.411
And that's not really normal for her.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.493
She usually just calls about normal stuff, you know?

13:28.893 --> 13:30.254
Not that she has something to share.

13:30.274 --> 13:30.894
You know?

13:32.755 --> 13:39.741
And what it was, was that she actually wanted to share a new song that she just heard that was from Japan.

13:40.322 --> 13:44.546
And supposedly, it reminded her of us.

13:45.727 --> 13:47.929
Can you tell what song that was, Ruffians?

13:48.109 --> 13:48.789
Can you guess?

13:49.750 --> 13:58.318
Yeah, we were able to guess right away without her saying anything more, but... What song do you think it was?

14:01.104 --> 14:02.845
Ruffians ain't no gonna pull a mama puppy right.

14:02.865 --> 14:03.185
Right.

14:03.245 --> 14:03.425
Right.

14:30.421 --> 14:33.126
I guess the Ruffians just can't guess it, huh Moco-chan?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.429
I saw it multiple times.

14:34.870 --> 14:35.912
I just saw it!

14:36.032 --> 14:36.573
I just saw it!

14:37.338 --> 14:38.099
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:38.119 --> 14:38.519
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:38.539 --> 14:39.059
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:39.119 --> 14:39.980
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:40.000 --> 14:40.460
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:40.480 --> 14:41.101
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:41.141 --> 14:41.721
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:41.761 --> 14:42.241
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:42.281 --> 14:43.542
FUWAMOCO Morning!

15:03.744 --> 15:10.787
Oh, it's so, so trendy, but I don't know between, you know, between idol and nante tatte idol.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.628
You remember we sang during a Rock n' Rawr Party, right?

15:14.269 --> 15:16.530
Nante tatte idol.

15:16.550 --> 15:17.230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:17.270 --> 15:22.592
Yeah, I think between the two though, we prefer nante tatte idol, right?

15:22.632 --> 15:23.153
Yeah.

15:23.173 --> 15:23.513
Yeah.

15:24.213 --> 15:25.975
Yeah.

15:26.555 --> 15:33.041
But you know, we are happy that maybe Mama Puppy heard a new song and it reminded her of us.

15:33.121 --> 15:36.645
Thank you Mama Puppy!

15:38.206 --> 15:39.227
Yeah, I don't know.

15:39.247 --> 15:43.071
We were just surprised we could guess it right away.

15:43.111 --> 15:45.893
But if it's the mama song, that would be surprising.

15:46.314 --> 15:47.555
I wouldn't be able to guess that.

15:47.635 --> 15:47.735
No.

15:47.775 --> 15:47.895
Yeah.

15:52.149 --> 15:53.070
End of story time.

15:53.090 --> 15:56.070
Hopefully we don't get any more phone calls.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.871
Even if they're from Mama Puppy, that'd be scary.

15:59.131 --> 16:00.231
Why is it scary?

16:00.771 --> 16:01.792
Phone calls are scary.

16:01.872 --> 16:04.332
Ah, phone calls are scary, but if it's Mama Puppy, it's fine.

16:04.872 --> 16:05.913
But it's still scary.

16:06.193 --> 16:07.333
BAU BAU!

16:07.393 --> 16:07.713
BAU BAU!

16:12.738 --> 16:14.179
I thought we were good.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.380
I thought we were good too.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.161
We were so so close, Moco-chan.

16:17.201 --> 16:17.961
I thought we were good.

16:37.830 --> 16:46.173
Well, Ruffians, you know, yesterday we had an extra, extra special collab with Tally-senpai!

16:46.193 --> 16:49.394
We participated in a special twin showdown.

16:49.694 --> 16:50.334
Showdown.

16:50.354 --> 16:50.975
Twin showdown.

16:50.995 --> 16:51.235
Yeah.

16:51.255 --> 16:54.056
That was produced by Tally-senpai too.

16:54.076 --> 16:55.136
What did you think?

16:55.176 --> 16:56.136
What did you think?

16:56.356 --> 16:56.977
We had fun.

16:56.997 --> 16:58.497
We had a lot of fun.

17:04.343 --> 17:07.624
But there was one question.

17:08.264 --> 17:14.005
Maybe more questions, but at least one question that maybe some Ruffians were surprised about.

17:16.906 --> 17:19.327
Was there one question you were surprised about?

17:22.307 --> 17:23.028
Ship questions?

17:23.768 --> 17:26.068
I'm seeing a lot of questions.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.540
Well, you know, there was one question.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.180
This is what we thought.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.601
We thought it was a misunderstanding.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.722
That the Ruffians misunderstood.

17:41.962 --> 17:45.803
It's not our misunderstanding, it's your misunderstanding.

17:45.823 --> 17:46.924
Okay?

17:47.544 --> 17:53.306
What was one of the weirdest gifts Moco-chan has given you?

17:53.326 --> 17:57.688
Yeah, and I responded, a ring.

17:58.388 --> 17:58.588
Yeah.

18:01.024 --> 18:06.468
It's not weird.

18:06.708 --> 18:10.731
It's not the kind of ring that you might be thinking.

18:11.212 --> 18:12.913
So don't misunderstand that.

18:13.313 --> 18:18.117
Even though the graphic sort of looks like different types of rings, I just wanted two that looked the same, okay?

18:18.917 --> 18:19.798
Matching ring.

18:19.838 --> 18:20.799
I didn't have options.

18:20.839 --> 18:24.002
Don't think of other things, okay?

18:24.222 --> 18:25.223
It's nothing special.

18:25.243 --> 18:27.145
They weren't anything expensive, okay?

18:27.386 --> 18:29.388
Do you think I would buy an expensive ring?

18:29.768 --> 18:40.258
Do I, like, look like that kind of... Do I look like that kind of demon guide dog where I can be buying expensive rings?

18:41.219 --> 18:41.379
No.

18:42.884 --> 18:44.426
I... I can't.

18:44.786 --> 18:50.353
They're special to us.

18:50.654 --> 18:59.946
You know, not many twin sisters are as fortunate as us to be so close and to be able to spend so much time together, so... You know, we feel really lucky.

19:01.576 --> 19:09.220
One day, you know, maybe there might be a day that comes and our time together will be less and less, you know?

19:09.300 --> 19:15.103
So we really treasure every day that we have together, too.

19:15.143 --> 19:17.765
That's why Moco-chan got those rings for us, right?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.286
It was a surprise, right?

19:19.326 --> 19:23.408
Yeah, but Moco-chan messed it up.

19:24.208 --> 19:24.769
I did!

19:25.469 --> 19:27.150
Yeah, I did.

19:27.825 --> 19:30.426
You know, I'm not used to wearing rings either.

19:30.466 --> 19:36.068
So, I measured the wrong spot on the wrong figure.

19:36.428 --> 19:36.928
Finger.

19:37.669 --> 19:40.470
And both the rings are too loose on my thumb.

19:41.110 --> 19:46.952
I think especially for Fuwawa, if she was to wear it, she'd lose it right away.

19:47.172 --> 19:48.072
It's just too loose.

19:49.946 --> 19:53.528
But, but, you know, it's okay because it's still precious.

19:53.588 --> 19:54.289
Yeah, yeah.

19:54.469 --> 19:55.469
It's a symbol, right?

19:55.509 --> 20:01.333
Yeah, we both don't wear rings really anyways, so it's kind of hard to get used to, too.

20:01.353 --> 20:03.274
Oh, we could get them resized.

20:04.435 --> 20:05.695
But that's tricky.

20:05.855 --> 20:06.476
Right.

20:06.616 --> 20:08.077
It costs money.

20:08.177 --> 20:08.357
Right.

20:09.446 --> 20:14.891
But you know more than anything, it's the meaning and the symbolism and the thought that counts, right?

20:15.671 --> 20:17.893
Surprise gifts are always good, right?

20:18.193 --> 20:22.297
Especially when we don't give gifts to each other too much, right?

20:23.218 --> 20:24.218
It's the thought that matters.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.480
Are you good?

20:27.901 --> 20:31.524
I think so.

20:31.825 --> 20:33.626
You understand, right, Ruffians?

20:33.926 --> 20:35.388
It's not anything...

20:36.516 --> 20:38.276
Not anything like you might think.

20:38.356 --> 20:41.397
It's just, you know, special sister rings.

20:42.317 --> 20:42.797
That's it.

20:43.277 --> 20:45.178
I'm sure Nerissa is the same, too.

20:45.698 --> 20:47.458
What do you mean?

20:47.938 --> 20:49.238
We're three sisters, too.

20:49.618 --> 20:51.299
Oh, three sisters!

20:51.539 --> 20:52.579
That's a lot of rings.

20:54.599 --> 20:55.960
Do they make three rings?

20:56.700 --> 20:59.260
When I was looking, they make a lot of matching rings.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.080
Oh, really?

21:00.220 --> 21:01.601
Yeah.

21:01.901 --> 21:02.021
Wait.

21:04.324 --> 21:07.627
We have to ask Nerissa too!

21:07.747 --> 21:09.388
It's totally normal.

21:09.768 --> 21:15.353
BAU BAU!

21:16.474 --> 21:17.054
Ruffians.

21:21.998 --> 21:23.059
Ruffians.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.341
FUWAMOCO.

21:26.642 --> 21:27.422
We have something.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.691
Something to confess.

21:31.151 --> 21:31.491
Hi.

21:31.611 --> 21:34.093
But I don't know how I feel about this, FUWAMOCO-chan.

21:34.133 --> 21:34.714
Yeah.

21:37.496 --> 21:42.000
Actually, we're both a bit concerned about you.

21:42.040 --> 21:42.280
Yeah.

21:43.181 --> 21:44.042
We're concerned.

21:45.703 --> 21:49.166
You know, did you notice anything weird on Twitter?

21:49.186 --> 21:49.226
Hi.

21:49.246 --> 21:51.608
Did you?

21:53.850 --> 21:54.270
Did you?

21:54.290 --> 21:54.350
Huh?

21:59.821 --> 22:04.684
You are, but we're still concerned.

22:08.926 --> 22:10.567
Haven't tip?

22:11.308 --> 22:11.908
What do you mean?

22:11.928 --> 22:13.129
You're not looking at Twitter.

22:24.190 --> 22:25.091
Choco-sensei.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.152
No, no, no Choco-sensei.

22:29.513 --> 22:32.475
Okay, I don't see any Ruffians in all this.

22:32.535 --> 22:35.156
This is why we're concerned, okay?

22:35.816 --> 22:36.897
Ruffians!

22:37.738 --> 22:43.421
You know, I tweet for today's FUWAMOCO Morning.

22:43.461 --> 22:44.081
Moco-chan, wait.

22:44.521 --> 22:44.781
Wait.

22:45.342 --> 22:47.523
You really didn't notice something strange?

22:47.563 --> 22:49.224
We tweeted something strange.

22:50.888 --> 22:53.751
I'm not a single Ruffian to notice deshita, Moco-chan.

22:55.914 --> 22:56.775
Okay, Moco-chan.

22:56.835 --> 22:57.656
Yeah, you say it.

22:57.896 --> 22:58.377
You say it!

22:58.877 --> 23:00.459
The tweet was a bit weird, okay?

23:00.479 --> 23:02.302
For today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

23:02.362 --> 23:04.084
Here it is, okay?

23:04.704 --> 23:05.085
De-den.

23:07.708 --> 23:08.769
That's amazing.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.362
And then she asked me if we could read it over.

23:29.382 --> 23:32.283
And we couldn't stop laughing together.

23:32.423 --> 23:32.944
Yeah.

23:33.224 --> 23:34.524
We're just a laugh buddle.

23:34.544 --> 23:39.786
So then Moco-chan said that we should tweet it just as it is.

23:39.846 --> 23:39.966
Yeah.

23:40.066 --> 23:43.748
And I haven't seen any Ruffians here, but... Yeah, if you catch it.

23:44.288 --> 23:45.389
Nobody did.

23:45.489 --> 23:45.829
Uh-uh.

23:47.149 --> 23:49.010
Are you reading our tweets, Ruffians?

23:49.190 --> 23:49.810
Are you?

23:49.890 --> 23:51.111
Are you actually?

23:51.131 --> 23:51.211
Yeah.

23:51.451 --> 23:53.932
You're not just looking at the pretty picture.

23:53.952 --> 23:55.132
We didn't answer a question.

23:55.152 --> 23:55.433
Right.

23:55.493 --> 23:55.793
What?

23:55.993 --> 23:56.433
Right.

23:57.859 --> 24:04.749
Has the week been going by for you as it has passed for us?

24:14.064 --> 24:16.246
Has it, Ruffians?

24:17.888 --> 24:21.311
Has the week been going by for you as fast for us?

24:22.092 --> 24:30.040
I don't even know how to fix this sentence.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.342
It has to be changed completely.

24:33.003 --> 24:33.683
You get it?

24:39.704 --> 24:41.145
English is hard.

24:41.165 --> 24:43.187
Just a bit sometimes.

24:43.468 --> 24:44.268
Just a bit.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.411
It's good to know that the Ruffians aren't reading our tweets.

24:47.512 --> 24:48.012
No!

24:48.372 --> 24:50.895
Please read our tweets, okay?

24:50.915 --> 24:50.995
Okay.

24:51.635 --> 24:54.758
I'm gonna be waiting for your report.

24:56.780 --> 24:57.081
Thank you.

24:57.501 --> 25:00.543
I'm waiting for your responses, okay?

25:00.623 --> 25:01.624
Moco-chan is too.

25:02.004 --> 25:02.745
I guess, maybe.

25:02.765 --> 25:03.485
BAU BAU!

25:04.186 --> 25:06.187
Nothing else weird on Twitter.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.269
Please use your eyes, okay?

25:08.289 --> 25:08.709
Yeah, okay.

25:08.729 --> 25:09.430
Use your eyes.

25:10.671 --> 25:14.714
Well, maybe this next part will help you use your eyes.

25:15.254 --> 25:16.535
Maybe wake up a little bit.

25:16.855 --> 25:20.418
I have something to say!

25:21.979 --> 25:22.199
Hi.

25:23.940 --> 25:24.341
You know,

25:26.423 --> 25:32.526
I think it's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

25:33.327 --> 25:37.109
And this time you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

25:38.629 --> 25:39.490
Hey sleepyhead.

25:41.071 --> 25:41.671
Yes, you.

25:42.491 --> 25:43.272
Sleepyhead.

25:44.733 --> 25:45.453
Are you awake?

25:47.394 --> 25:48.875
Are you awake?! !

25:50.253 --> 25:51.114
Hopefully you are now.

25:52.395 --> 25:58.620
Even though you might not have gotten much of a rest last night, you're gonna make everything today amazing!

25:59.540 --> 26:01.242
You're already up and going, you know it.

26:01.862 --> 26:02.703
I know you can do it.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.966
No matter what silly things try to take you down, you'll be fine!

26:07.847 --> 26:11.470
You know, they're just out of your control, so let them roll off of you.

26:12.070 --> 26:17.395
Just trust yourself, trust your instincts, trust your smile, and you'll be good!

26:18.979 --> 26:19.620
I trust you.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.661
So you should too, okay?

26:22.602 --> 26:25.404
Don't let the little things ruin your strife!

26:26.285 --> 26:30.128
You're amazing, and we'll all make it to the weekend!

26:30.488 --> 26:31.509
Just keep going!

26:32.249 --> 26:33.951
I believe you'll be O-E-O-K!

26:34.431 --> 26:37.173
Ganba-shin-ya!

26:37.574 --> 26:38.214
BAU BAU!

26:38.294 --> 26:38.494
Howl.

26:39.435 --> 26:44.799
Are you okay, huh?

26:49.401 --> 26:50.582
Moco-chan, you know what?

26:51.102 --> 26:55.124
You need an A to be ALK and Moco-chan's name doesn't have any A's in it.

26:55.624 --> 26:56.504
But guess who does?

26:56.524 --> 27:01.827
I was thinking maybe the Ruffians.

27:03.351 --> 27:04.391
Ruffians.

27:04.551 --> 27:05.732
Ruffians.

27:05.852 --> 27:08.033
Fancy.

27:08.353 --> 27:12.434
Let's see who our Doggie of the Day is today, Moco-chan!

27:12.594 --> 27:14.355
We have... De-den!

27:15.195 --> 27:19.676
Two doggies of the day!

27:19.796 --> 27:22.697
It's Snickers and Brownie!

27:23.137 --> 27:25.198
Very appropriate name.

27:25.238 --> 27:27.319
They look almost as close as we are, Moco-chan.

27:28.958 --> 27:33.803
But, you know, it's nice that they get along and like to cuddle up to each other.

27:33.843 --> 27:34.564
Yeah.

27:34.744 --> 27:40.309
Moco-chan's always really cool, so... Yeah.

27:40.389 --> 27:41.110
Ruffians.

27:41.831 --> 27:47.777
Moco-chan's just so cool that she tries to cuddle up to me all the time for warmth when I'm busy.

27:47.937 --> 27:48.998
I don't know why I'm cool.

27:49.018 --> 27:49.758
I'm just cool.

27:50.959 --> 27:51.580
It's annoying.

27:52.140 --> 27:53.320
It's a bit annoying.

27:53.620 --> 27:56.802
We definitely don't have the air-conditioning going.

27:57.682 --> 28:05.205
But sometimes, you know, when I'm called the Moco-chan there, so, you know, it's good, it's good.

28:05.225 --> 28:09.447
But hopefully, you know, hopefully they don't annoy each other, you know.

28:09.487 --> 28:10.887
They're always good buddies.

28:10.967 --> 28:16.369
Right, but it seems like they also joined us for a stream of Planetarium!

28:16.429 --> 28:17.770
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

28:17.990 --> 28:22.071
Well, I hope that they enjoyed it and maybe didn't get too emotional.

28:22.111 --> 28:25.452
It'd be bad if they started going howl, howl, howl.

28:25.612 --> 28:25.872
Yeah.

28:26.252 --> 28:29.232
But on that note, how do they BAU BAU?

28:29.272 --> 28:31.813
How does Neko sound like?

28:32.453 --> 28:33.633
I think a bit creamy.

28:33.833 --> 28:34.553
Creamy?

28:34.574 --> 28:34.914
Yeah.

28:35.434 --> 28:36.534
Like BAU BAU.

28:36.554 --> 28:36.834
Really?

28:37.014 --> 28:37.754
I was thinking like a BAU.

28:38.274 --> 28:39.675
BAU.

28:39.695 --> 28:42.575
I think it's the same.

28:43.395 --> 28:43.695
Yeah.

28:43.875 --> 28:44.856
Creamy, yeah.

28:45.636 --> 28:46.376
And brownie!

28:47.458 --> 28:48.180
BAUPA!

28:49.483 --> 28:50.105
Really?

28:50.245 --> 28:51.107
A bit fancy.

28:51.268 --> 28:51.528
Really?

28:51.548 --> 28:53.593
I was thinking like a BAU BAU.

28:54.035 --> 28:54.957
Ah, that's good too.

28:55.338 --> 28:56.681
Really?

28:56.741 --> 28:56.882
Yeah.

28:57.871 --> 29:05.435
Well you know, Snickers and Brownie, they have each other to annoy, which I guess is good, because then you don't get annoyed.

29:06.576 --> 29:08.036
They'll annoy each other, not you.

29:08.337 --> 29:09.697
You're busy.

29:10.038 --> 29:22.744
But I guess more than anything, you know they have each other to keep company, and they get along really well, and they love each other, and I'm sure they love you even more too!

29:23.325 --> 29:24.585
BAU BAU!

29:27.347 --> 29:30.809
And for our next corner, the Ruffians go for a walk.

29:31.509 --> 29:33.250
Ruffians, you've been going for walks, right?

29:33.270 --> 29:41.996
What a nice day for sightseeing in France!

29:42.736 --> 29:44.057
That's so cool.

29:44.437 --> 29:47.619
You know, and it's really wonderful that Gura-senpai went along with you.

29:47.639 --> 29:48.219
Right!

29:48.379 --> 29:50.340
All dressed up in her dinosaur outfit, too.

29:50.380 --> 29:51.521
Thank you.

29:51.681 --> 29:52.321
Right?

29:52.442 --> 29:56.024
You know, it makes the trip even that much more special.

29:56.784 --> 29:59.628
Since you're in France, did you eat anything yummy?

30:11.440 --> 30:14.661
I don't really know what France is known for when it comes to food.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.041
French bread.

30:16.622 --> 30:16.962
Bread?

30:17.802 --> 30:18.242
French bread?

30:18.922 --> 30:19.523
You eat bread.

30:20.043 --> 30:21.323
Have some good bread!

30:21.403 --> 30:22.403
Bread, bread, bread!

30:22.423 --> 30:25.624
We hope you have a great time in France!

30:25.945 --> 30:27.605
BAU BAU BOKU!

30:27.785 --> 30:29.706
BAU BAU BOKU!

30:29.726 --> 30:34.467
Time for our Question of the Day!

30:34.487 --> 30:35.708
We have...

30:37.674 --> 30:38.295
De-den!

30:39.055 --> 30:39.316
Oh!

30:39.876 --> 30:40.837
Got a little question.

30:40.937 --> 30:41.277
Okay.

30:41.718 --> 30:43.259
Who is making the thumbnail?

30:43.279 --> 30:45.761
Good question.

30:46.082 --> 30:48.364
Well, I think we maybe mentioned it before, right?

30:48.784 --> 30:50.466
But Pero does!

30:50.766 --> 30:51.126
Yeah.

30:51.246 --> 30:59.294
Even though, you know, Pero can be really nasty at times, we're also really thankful that Pero makes the thumbnails for us, you know?

31:00.034 --> 31:03.415
That's why we gotta make sure that he's at least kinda safe.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.896
That's the reason why we went to look at him.

31:07.196 --> 31:10.217
And I can make thumbnails too, Moco-chan!

31:10.257 --> 31:18.460
Maybe not so much, but things are really busy for us, so having Peron make them gives us more time to prepare for things.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.281
You know, iron out issues, as well as get some more sleep.

31:23.447 --> 31:27.989
But we also do let Pero know what kind of ideas we have for them.

31:28.030 --> 31:33.853
And then Pero gets creative and then surprises us!

31:33.953 --> 31:36.854
Thank you Pero for helping us out so much.

31:36.974 --> 31:39.796
Yeah, I guess he can be sort of great sometimes.

31:40.596 --> 31:42.417
That's why he's the Great Perroccino.

31:42.437 --> 31:44.959
The great stands for great at making thumbnails.

31:45.019 --> 31:45.999
I wouldn't go that far.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.441
Yeah.

31:49.901 --> 31:59.947
Right, so even if Pero kinda gets a bit annoyed, we kinda wanna throw him around or kick him or stomp him, we gotta remember, think of the thumbnails, right?

31:59.968 --> 32:01.068
Think of the thumbnails.

32:01.148 --> 32:01.749
Yeah.

32:01.829 --> 32:04.550
BAU BAU!

32:04.590 --> 32:06.551
Very good question, FUWAMOCO-chan.

32:06.571 --> 32:07.292
Good question.

32:07.332 --> 32:08.613
Yeah.

32:08.633 --> 32:12.915
Well, for our next team, we have... De-den.

32:13.836 --> 32:14.796
Speaking of thumbnails.

32:16.638 --> 32:17.238
I'm alone.

32:18.214 --> 32:22.215
I'm alone, and I'm ghost hunting on my own.

32:22.976 --> 32:27.657
Ruffians, please, please be there to help me, okay?

32:28.377 --> 32:33.019
Moco-chan won't be there, so I'll have to depend on you for support.

32:33.239 --> 32:38.560
Let's figure out the ghost together!

32:38.580 --> 32:40.061
Why are you unblessing?

32:41.641 --> 32:42.762
No, Ruffians.

32:46.622 --> 32:49.512
It's gonna be scary, that's why I need you there!

32:51.047 --> 32:55.129
But hopefully we can figure out the ghosts and then we can buy some flashlights.

32:55.449 --> 32:56.689
Flashlights.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.990
I wish I could hold multiple flashlights, you know?

32:59.070 --> 33:02.672
And like, just be like a, become a Dekotora and just be like, wow!

33:02.712 --> 33:04.212
Look at all my lights!

33:04.232 --> 33:08.274
It might be catching the ghosts a bit difficult, but that's okay.

33:08.694 --> 33:09.635
It won't be scary then.

33:10.135 --> 33:16.678
Please tell me, okay, Ruffians, my first time all on my own.

33:17.058 --> 33:18.958
I have phasmophobia too.

33:20.706 --> 33:21.326
BAU BAU!

33:21.407 --> 33:22.247
BAU BAU!

33:22.407 --> 33:36.196
And if we take another peek at our schedule, well, on Thursday, Moco-chan will be back, and we're going back and continuing our journey in the Zelda Archimede of Time!

33:36.717 --> 33:41.720
Last time, you know, we finally became Big Link, and we're gonna have to get rid of Ganondorf.

33:42.327 --> 33:43.708
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

33:57.901 --> 34:03.968
Please join us, we're playing it on the N64 too, so it's a bit special, right?

34:04.609 --> 34:09.915
And then, on Sunday, we're going back to Donkey Kong Country!

34:09.975 --> 34:12.538
Bananas, bananas!

34:12.618 --> 34:16.523
But you know, I don't know, that's what you say right now, but...

34:17.586 --> 34:22.127
It feels like last time we were able to get much, much better.

34:22.167 --> 34:25.508
Hopefully our luck continues.

34:25.828 --> 34:27.949
We have lots and lots of many lives.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.550
BAU BAU!

34:32.890 --> 34:36.872
It was another fun 25th FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:37.012 --> 34:37.852
Another 25th.

34:37.872 --> 34:38.772
Another FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:38.812 --> 34:39.692
A special 25th one.

34:39.712 --> 34:40.153
But before

34:45.506 --> 34:47.107
We say BAU BAU for now.

34:47.487 --> 34:52.889
We'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.609
Our 25th episode.

34:55.270 --> 34:59.391

34:59.431 --> 35:00.712
Can we do it, Moco-chan?

35:00.732 --> 35:00.712
25?

35:00.792 --> 35:02.132
Can we count that many?

35:02.172 --> 35:04.273
Let's do our best, okay?
