00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:14.262
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:20.688
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:28.995
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:35.341
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:38.023
I am not Mococo, I'm Raora!

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:43.108
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:55.119
Today, we're your hosts on FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.382
We're all here to thank you!

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:03.106
Ruffians, thank you for joining us on FUWAMOCO!

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:06.289
I'm excited for this episode today!

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:11.335
Surprise!

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:14.078
Surprise!

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.381
I'm so happy!

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:17.262
Big morning!

00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:18.904
Big morning!

00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:22.909
Thank you for joining us today!

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:29.897
Thank you for having me!

00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:35.391
Thank you for having me!

00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:36.353
Dog house!

00:06:36.373 --> 00:06:38.558
I'm in the dog house!

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.102
Now it's my house!

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:44.593
Big cat house!

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.097
Big dog house!

00:06:46.077 --> 00:06:48.240
Now, this is the dog house.

00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.022
Dog house!

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.104
This is dog house.

00:06:51.124 --> 00:06:51.324
Cat house.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:51.865
For now.

00:06:51.885 --> 00:07:00.696
I understand that maybe this could be a little bit confusing.

00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:00.776
No!

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:04.301
For those who are joining us for the first time, hello!

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:10.890
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.030
A.K.A.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.230
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.692
And it's hosted by us!

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:29.618
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:34.905
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:42.274
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:46.379
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.463
BAU BAU!

00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:56.134
How do you feel about it?

00:07:56.214 --> 00:08:01.282
Is this the first time you've been on such an early morning stream?

00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:03.205
First FUWAMOCO Morning together.

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:08.673
I feel like maybe sometimes we're earlier than usual.

00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:11.317
Maybe sometimes.

00:08:11.337 --> 00:08:13.020
Maybe not that often.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.905
Wow!

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.910
A new week is starting!

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.537
Yeah!

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:19.817
Happy Monday!

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:19.958
Yeah!

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:21.361
We started on the right paw!

00:08:21.382 --> 00:08:25.733
Take a look at some interesting and fun things that have happened!

00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:25.953
Yeah!

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:28.640
Let's see.

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:29.001
Moco-chan.

00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:31.632
FUWAMOCO!

00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:37.600
We have a guest here!

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.101
What happened?

00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:41.766
Why are you sad?

00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:48.855
There's been a perrocite.

00:08:50.017 --> 00:08:52.159
Today is just a perrocite.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.301
What happened?

00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:58.752
Moco-chan, what was Pero sporting?

00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:05.745
Let's take a look, okay?

00:09:05.765 --> 00:09:06.066
Let's find out.

00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:06.346
De-den!

00:09:06.366 --> 00:09:06.467
Cute!

00:09:06.487 --> 00:09:10.535
It's cute, but in the center there's something kind of nasty there too.

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:15.424
It looks decorative, but it's not cute.

00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:18.064
I don't know at all at all.

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:22.934
There's some really cute ones here, but, well, what should we do?

00:09:22.954 --> 00:09:28.847
Give me like a nasty one!

00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:29.007
No, no!

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:29.107
Why?

00:09:29.127 --> 00:09:31.111
Does he deserve to have a decorated photo clip?

00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:32.494
And no, is he some sort of celebrity?

00:09:32.514 --> 00:09:32.574
No!

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:35.320
I like Pero.

00:09:35.823 --> 00:09:36.944
You what?

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:38.086
How?

00:09:38.106 --> 00:09:39.147
How say that again?

00:09:39.387 --> 00:09:40.609
What?

00:09:40.729 --> 00:09:41.069
What?

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.810
I like.

00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:43.172
I like Perroccino.

00:09:43.632 --> 00:09:45.014
You like nasty things?

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:46.676
Eh?

00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:47.517
No, Pero is not nasty.

00:09:47.537 --> 00:09:49.319
It's cute.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:49.580
Look at him.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:49.820
Surround.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.982
Wait, wait.

00:09:52.002 --> 00:09:55.627
Raora, can you say The Great Perroccino in Italian for me?

00:09:56.848 --> 00:09:57.469
Perroccino?

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.592
The Great Perroccino!

00:10:00.212 --> 00:10:01.654
The Great?

00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:01.954
Yeah!

00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:04.918
Uh... Il...

00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:11.167
El Magnifico Perroccino!

00:10:11.187 --> 00:10:12.489
You shouldn't be saying that, you know.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.354
You don't know what kind of power that has.

00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:20.059
Okay, I think that means, you know, we have these really cute photocards.

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:26.949
But Pero needs to be ripped in two again.

00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:27.790
No, no, no.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.051
I'm perfect.

00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:28.311
I'm Pero.

00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:28.652
I'm perfect too.

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:30.374
Rip the nasty one in two, okay?

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:32.237
Or you could give it to Lala, maybe.

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:33.218
No.

00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:44.331
FUWAMOCO Morning has officially started!

00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:50.679
Good morning!

00:10:51.019 --> 00:11:02.192
We started the day on the right paw, right, Ruffians?

00:11:02.172 --> 00:11:07.069
Don't let Pero get in your way or not.

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:19.171
On the topic of chaos, the other day we had a bunch of chaos in Among Us!

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:28.083
It was a very special collab organized by Kiara-chan and I because we wanted to play Among Us.

00:11:28.223 --> 00:11:32.449
So a bunch of people from the gallery all got together and we played Among Us!

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:35.403
No I'm not!

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.090
I wanted to be an imposter so bad!

00:11:38.992 --> 00:11:39.333
I didn't realize!

00:11:39.353 --> 00:11:41.418
I feel like you were though!

00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:42.722
I was really scared of you.

00:11:42.742 --> 00:11:44.165
I thought you were the imposter.

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:45.368
You know what guys?

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:46.572
I am justice.

00:11:46.732 --> 00:11:48.035
I cannot be the imposter.

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:49.138
That is why.

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.809
She lies so easily.

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:54.814
What do you mean?

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:59.262
No, I don't lie!

00:11:59.282 --> 00:12:00.003
Don't!

00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:00.144
Don't!

00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:02.428
She's saying she's an engineer!

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:04.111
I am an engineer.

00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:05.253
I am an engineer.

00:12:05.273 --> 00:12:06.615
I don't know what to believe.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:07.377
She's an engineer.

00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:08.659
I can bet.

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:09.480
I'm an engineer.

00:12:10.182 --> 00:12:11.344
Look at my degree.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:12.105
The degree?

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:13.708
I have a degree.

00:12:13.688 --> 00:12:16.572
I have a degree in science!

00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:18.215
Show me, Fuwawa!

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:24.064
If you're an engineer, then what color is red?

00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:27.048
I think it's red.

00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:33.959
What does an engineer have to say to back up that?

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:38.245
Okay, I know what- I know, I know.

00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:43.167
I'm an engineer.

00:12:43.187 --> 00:12:48.614
Somehow this all has to do with the chaos that erupted in Among Us.

00:12:51.478 --> 00:12:51.859
It was so much fun!

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:54.122
FUWAMOCO, should we talk about the part where you killed me?

00:12:54.142 --> 00:12:55.824
We killed you?

00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:56.825
Yeah, you killed me.

00:12:57.146 --> 00:12:58.287
I don't even remember that.

00:12:58.347 --> 00:12:59.789
It was such a small memory.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.251
It was so insignificant.

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:03.274
Should we talk about that?

00:13:03.414 --> 00:13:05.236
I just wanted to kill.

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:09.582
It was so insignificant, I couldn't remember.

00:13:10.253 --> 00:13:14.703
I don't know who's foot was on our paws.

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:23.241
It did not even cross my thoughts.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.383
Oh, that's why.

00:13:26.327 --> 00:13:27.390
Someone help me.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.753
Someone help me.

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.777
They trapped me in the dark house.

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:33.482
We had a lot of fun!

00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:36.546
And if you want your tummy to hurt, go check it out.

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.650
There's a lot of different perspectives.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.835
You can hear a lot of different FUWAMOCO screams.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.456
Probably.

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:44.597
On different streams.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:45.899
Yeah.

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:50.325
I hope we can play more together.

00:13:50.345 --> 00:13:50.445
Yeah!

00:13:50.465 --> 00:13:50.746
I'm a monster!

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:51.827
You're a monster, right?

00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:53.189
You're a monster.

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:54.491
And Calli-senpai.

00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:55.292
Next time.

00:13:56.574 --> 00:13:56.874
Maybe.

00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:58.857
Two pink members.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.743
Go Impostors!

00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:04.654
BAU BAU!

00:14:04.674 --> 00:14:05.275
You watch it?

00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:08.078
You watch BOTTOBOY POV 3?

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.902
Yeah!

00:14:10.922 --> 00:14:11.122
Thank you!

00:14:11.743 --> 00:14:12.044
Thank you!

00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:17.771
Are you still hearing all the screams?

00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:24.800
Afterwards, the emergency button press is always like... Now she becomes the emergency button.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.823
Yeah, she's the emergency button.

00:14:26.843 --> 00:14:29.266
Just pop the hat, you know?

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:32.050
BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:34.173
Is that your momo sounds?

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:35.495
That's my momo sounds!

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:41.781
We definitely have to play again soon!

00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.105
Please check it out on K-Ruffians!

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:45.285
BAU BAU!

00:14:45.305 --> 00:14:47.607
And also, FUWAMOCO news!

00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:56.697
Over the weekend at FUWAMOCO, we had our very first arrival festival in Japan!

00:14:56.717 --> 00:14:56.957
BAU BAU!

00:14:57.747 --> 00:15:02.996
Congratulations!

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:08.546
I don't know how, but FUWAMOCO is the first member in EN to have an arrival festival!

00:15:09.348 --> 00:15:18.925
It was so much fun being able to explore Hollow Earth all together with the Ruffians!

00:15:18.945 --> 00:15:20.368
We need to do it with the Chachini too!

00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:21.730
What is Hollow Earth for those watching this?

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.813
What is holo-earth?

00:15:25.234 --> 00:15:36.989
Well, to explain, holo-earth is a project to recover for the next evolution and bring hololive talents together with you in a way not possible before in a new immersive social experience.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.454
I see, that explains a lot, huh?

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:45.540
We can have a lot of fun that we can't have usually through holo-earth.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.611
You know we had to watch along and watch the environment too.

00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:51.713
We had some tracking.

00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:56.844
We had to move around.

00:15:57.085 --> 00:15:57.786
Pretty funny.

00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:02.135
We also got a little creative.

00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:04.761
Not as creative as Dora.

00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:13.153
But we designed our very own t-shirt too!

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.375
It's cute, isn't it?

00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:16.397
It's the latest BAU BAU t-shirt!

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:16.578
So cute!

00:16:16.598 --> 00:16:17.799
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.002
It's adorable!

00:16:20.363 --> 00:16:21.905
I love it!

00:16:22.005 --> 00:16:24.108
It's very nice.

00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:29.736
Maybe it's hard to notice, but the pink and the blue part is actually a bit transparent.

00:16:29.716 --> 00:16:32.001
Like watercolors!

00:16:32.022 --> 00:16:34.367
Cute!

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:35.229
But I got the bubble!

00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:37.755
Thank you!

00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:38.918
But, but, but!

00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:44.772
You can get it in hololive and also in real life too!

00:16:44.752 --> 00:16:49.316
So if you wanna wear it maybe while you're going to the gym.

00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:49.636
Or maybe store.

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:52.979
You know, or just running out to get some groceries.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.780
Or pajamas.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.203
Yeah, it comes in a bunch of different sizes.

00:16:57.544 --> 00:16:57.944
It's on Amazon.

00:16:57.964 --> 00:17:01.868
There's a lot of different sizes and hopefully it should be easier to make.

00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:06.392
And you're gonna ride railways.

00:17:06.412 --> 00:17:06.712
Railway, right!

00:17:07.112 --> 00:17:11.676
I wonder, Raora, what would you do if you could do a t-shirt like that?

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:14.539
Maybe I would ride no jetpack for today.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:16.482
No jetpacks?

00:17:17.223 --> 00:17:21.150
Maybe I'll write big cat means big t-shirt.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.597
I like that one!

00:17:25.617 --> 00:17:26.979
That's so cute!

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:28.421
Big cat means big t-shirt!

00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:31.466
Because I love oversized t-shirts, right?

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:32.268
So I think it fits!

00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:37.616
I was thinking for the no jetpacks one though.

00:17:37.877 --> 00:17:41.202
It can say no jetpacks on the front, but then on the back...

00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:43.849
FUWAMOCO No!

00:17:46.475 --> 00:17:50.185
No jetpacks!

00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:52.170
No jetpacks!

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.117
Not for you Moco-chan.

00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:57.182
It's for your own safety.

00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:58.263
Don't cry now.

00:17:58.684 --> 00:18:00.206
I can't have a jetpack?

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:01.548
No, you cannot have a jetpack.

00:18:02.129 --> 00:18:03.230
Can I have a scooter?

00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:04.892
A scooter?

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.895
You can have a scooter in holo-earth!

00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:13.664
Well, we'll think about it and we need to see if we have budget for this, Moco-chan.

00:18:13.764 --> 00:18:17.930
I have an inventory, it has a scooter, but it doesn't do jumps and it doesn't do tricks.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.532
I need it to do that.

00:18:19.552 --> 00:18:22.316
When you get hurt, then it's my responsibility.

00:18:22.516 --> 00:18:22.596
Why?

00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:24.179
Then, I was wrong.

00:18:24.459 --> 00:18:29.007
Moco-chan happened to die in Hollow Earth, which was kind of embarrassing.

00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:32.472
So, I fell!

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:32.592
Okay!

00:18:32.973 --> 00:18:34.996
I fell with a big splat.

00:18:35.016 --> 00:18:39.524
Yeah, we were playing a bunch of parkour classes at the rock climbing.

00:18:39.544 --> 00:18:40.465
Yeah, that day means!

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:42.088
And that's when Moco-chan fell.

00:18:44.412 --> 00:18:47.537
But maybe then, you'll have your own arrival festival.

00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:52.175

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:57.274

FUWAMOCO

00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:26.915
I second one ever!

00:19:26.935 --> 00:19:27.315
But now it's nine!

00:19:27.336 --> 00:19:30.459
You're pretty good at eating so far, right?

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:31.580
I'm not that good.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.064
I tried this a few times.

00:19:35.084 --> 00:19:35.865
Do you have any tips?

00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:38.327
It's not rocking, right?

00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:40.369
I don't know about that.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:49.159
I think I just like to, you know, use things that are, you know, I just like to listen to and I try to replicate.

00:19:49.179 --> 00:19:52.202
So maybe try to find the things you like to listen to.

00:19:52.182 --> 00:19:58.571
What's your secret weapon against the Chichinus?

00:19:59.132 --> 00:19:59.954
I don't know.

00:19:59.994 --> 00:20:01.916
I don't know.

00:20:02.377 --> 00:20:05.542
I like when I burn to the mic.

00:20:07.565 --> 00:20:08.526
Yeah, like softly.

00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:16.778
Like a birthday cake?

00:20:19.002 --> 00:20:19.202
Chichinus!

00:20:19.182 --> 00:20:21.085
I like it.

00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:24.530
I see, we haven't tried something like that, huh?

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:30.578
Also, I had my maid outfit when I had my ASMR thing.

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.301
Cute!

00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:32.962
Maid aura!

00:20:36.327 --> 00:20:38.890
We'll have to try a lot more stuff, too.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.036
But if you want to check it out, it's in the Doggy Pack, okay?

00:20:43.056 --> 00:20:44.278
Let's give you a tip, too.

00:20:44.596 --> 00:21:00.529
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.811
PROMISE!

00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:15.162
They released a new cover song all of them together of UMAPUI LEGEND on IRyS-senpai's channel!

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:16.603
Oh, and you're embarrassed now.

00:21:16.624 --> 00:21:17.524
No, why, why?

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.186
We're jealous of you, Moco-chan.

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:22.349
I thought I was the only one who was interested.

00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:30.516
The thing is though, UMAPUI LEGEND as the title would imply, it's UMAPUI DANCES in ENGLISH!

What does this mean?

00:22:24.972 --> 00:22:29.761
Rawa does bath from the moment it's born!

00:22:31.445 --> 00:22:31.705
Finally bath!

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:56.916
My mom made so much food for me.

00:22:56.896 --> 00:23:02.884
I got to spend some time with my sisters.

00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:07.291
I got to rest a little bit.

00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:10.675
It was really nice.

00:23:10.996 --> 00:23:15.462
I could hug my grandma again.

00:23:17.197 --> 00:23:18.620
Bubi?

00:23:19.683 --> 00:23:20.264
My cat!

00:23:22.188 --> 00:23:24.875
Did you get to hug?

00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:28.323
Kiss?

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:29.064
Sniff?

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:31.931
Hug?

00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:34.176
Everything!

00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:38.312
I love my cat.

00:23:38.332 --> 00:23:39.873
He looks like a cube.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:41.095
A what?

00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:41.996
Cube.

00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:43.758
I thought you said he looks like a cube.

00:23:43.778 --> 00:23:45.239
I would say more like a sphere.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.062
A sphere.

00:23:47.082 --> 00:23:48.503
He looks like a sphere.

00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:49.004
More accurate statement.

00:23:49.024 --> 00:23:50.866
Have you ever seen a cat like a cube?

00:23:51.787 --> 00:23:51.987
Yeah.

00:23:52.267 --> 00:23:55.011
He's like a ball of four.

00:23:55.451 --> 00:23:57.493
You know, you're a cat.

00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:59.095
What shape do you think you are?

00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:01.598
I am a big cat.

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:03.079
Is that a sheep?

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:03.440
Big cat sheep.

00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:06.042
I am not a sheep.

00:24:06.442 --> 00:24:09.405
For some reason when you say big cat sheep, I think of a gummy bear.

00:24:12.107 --> 00:24:12.968
Moco-chan's gonna eat you!

00:24:13.108 --> 00:24:30.403
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:24:30.383 --> 00:24:31.764
To eat mine.

00:24:32.225 --> 00:24:33.426
You know what's gonna happen.

00:24:35.888 --> 00:24:36.669
Moco-chan?

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.752
Moco-chan!

00:24:39.772 --> 00:24:40.753
Moco-chan!

00:24:41.414 --> 00:24:41.794
Come back.

00:24:42.695 --> 00:24:43.076
No!

00:24:45.638 --> 00:24:51.664
We agreed that no one would touch each other's tail right before coming here, right?

00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:52.425
No!

00:24:56.108 --> 00:24:56.309
Moco-chan!

00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:56.389
No!

00:24:56.409 --> 00:24:56.609
Moco-chan!

00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:56.749
No!

00:24:56.769 --> 00:24:57.690
Okay, come back.

00:24:58.143 --> 00:24:59.986
Moco-chan.

00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:03.150
We still have more to talk about here.

00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:11.581
You're dubbing that face here.

00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:11.722
Hi.

00:25:12.463 --> 00:25:15.967
You're making the sounds that Nerissa does when she kisses Moco-chan.

00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:20.153
But your tail is so fluffy.

00:25:20.173 --> 00:25:23.958
No touching.

00:25:23.978 --> 00:25:24.479
Your tail is so fluffy.

00:25:24.499 --> 00:25:25.180
It's at least fluffy.

00:25:26.122 --> 00:25:30.251
It's so fuzzy.

00:25:30.271 --> 00:25:31.413
What's the next topic?

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:35.682
I was gonna say I'm glad you had a good trip in the Romance Empire.

00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:39.250
I hope nothing unexpected and bad happens.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.238
But I'm glad to have you back here too, Laura!

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:46.645
I'm happy to be back.

00:25:48.582 --> 00:25:56.619
Moco-chan, there's a request that you have for Laola.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.126
It's a souvenir from the Romance Empire.

00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:01.830
It's not that special.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:09.105
But I wanted Laola and I to say something because I thought the Ruffians would think it's cool.

00:26:09.254 --> 00:26:27.010
This girl happens to look exactly like FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:32.022
Beatrice.

00:26:33.826 --> 00:26:44.492
Beatrice.

00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:45.313
Again!

00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:47.475
Beatrice.

00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:49.196
Beatrice!

00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.637
Say it like that!

00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:56.242
Say it like that!

00:26:56.262 --> 00:26:57.923
Say it like that!

00:26:57.944 --> 00:26:58.804
Beatrice!

00:26:58.824 --> 00:26:59.965
Not with pizza.

00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:01.587
Pizzazz.

00:27:02.047 --> 00:27:06.271
Okay, there's no pizza.

00:27:06.311 --> 00:27:07.392
Beatrice and pizza?

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:09.473
Beatrice and pizza.

00:27:10.094 --> 00:27:11.115
Is that a new pizza?

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:13.737
It's a different...

00:27:14.695 --> 00:27:21.128
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:22.627 --> 00:27:26.514
At Bingsuino, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:29.959
We got to watch a movie!

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.741
With Calli-senpai!

00:27:30.761 --> 00:27:33.285
One that she really wanted to watch with us!

00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:37.352
The Prestige!

00:27:37.993 --> 00:27:38.394
It was a lot of fun!

00:27:38.414 --> 00:27:41.800
But you know Calli-senpai really wanted to watch that with FUWAMOCO.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.828
Nowadays there is a movie that you can make us watch and watch together with us.

00:27:46.808 --> 00:27:50.454
Together?

00:27:50.514 --> 00:27:51.576
That's hard to say.

00:27:51.616 --> 00:27:52.578
I don't know.

00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:55.282
I'm more into TV shows.

00:27:55.303 --> 00:27:56.364
What TV show?

00:27:57.246 --> 00:28:03.076
I'm watching... I forgot the name.

00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:04.378
I forgot.

00:28:04.358 --> 00:28:07.482
Maybe the Ruffians know what it is!

00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:07.822
Describe it!

00:28:07.842 --> 00:28:24.581
Okay, so it's a show where when you go to work, you split into, you know... You forget about your life, and then you just sever and sever.

00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:24.661
Oh!

00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:25.422
I've never heard of that!

00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:26.923
You split into different life?

00:28:27.304 --> 00:28:30.527
No, yeah, so basically when you go to work, you forget about your life.

00:28:30.728 --> 00:28:31.609
Reproduction?

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.830
Huh?

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.455
I'm so confused, what is this?

00:28:36.475 --> 00:28:45.147
So, yeah, so when you go to work, you go into this elevator, and in this elevator, you forget about your life, and your life is just about work.

00:28:45.888 --> 00:28:50.634
And then, when you come back, you don't know about work, and it's just your life.

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:53.679
It's just, it's like living two different lives together.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.264
It's like the on-off switch?

00:28:57.364 --> 00:28:58.285
Yeah, it's kinda like that.

00:29:00.388 --> 00:29:00.488
Yeah.

00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:04.016
I watched that with you, Nalana.

00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:04.376
Really?

00:29:04.396 --> 00:29:05.118
It's very nice.

00:29:05.138 --> 00:29:08.583
I just almost... I think I finished the second season.

00:29:08.603 --> 00:29:10.666
Is it relaxing or stressful?

00:29:10.706 --> 00:29:12.409
It's very stressful.

00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:13.250
It's not stressful.

00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:14.913
I just like stressful movies.

00:29:14.973 --> 00:29:16.676
Why is it stressful?

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:20.942
I'm not good at watching stressful things.

00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:22.525
It's really stressful.

00:29:22.946 --> 00:29:27.673
If we could make Nalana watch a movie with us... Yes!

00:29:27.653 --> 00:29:31.960
It would be Space Adventure Cobra, right Moco-chan?

00:29:32.902 --> 00:29:33.002
Yeah!

00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:40.574
Just like we made all of Elephant ones together in Space Adventure Cobra.

00:29:40.594 --> 00:29:40.695
Yeah!

00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:41.416
It was very cool.

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:43.299
It's a classic.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.902
Oh Moco-chan, you have another one.

00:29:45.543 --> 00:29:46.945
Princess Switch.

00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:49.752
Princess Switch.

00:29:49.772 --> 00:29:52.257
A classic holiday movie.

00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:53.199
Princess Switch.

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:54.241
Really?

00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:54.922
Who watched it?

00:29:56.726 --> 00:29:57.187
It's famous.

00:29:57.207 --> 00:29:59.451
Moco-chan likes it a lot.

00:29:59.511 --> 00:29:59.692
Really?

00:29:59.712 --> 00:30:01.255
I need to go watch it again.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.738
Oh, but baby, we'll have to have some more movie parties all together then.

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:09.644
Yeah, this is hopefully in the future.

00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:12.990
As well as marshmallows.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.956
BAU BAU!

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:16.136
BAU BAU!

00:30:16.156 --> 00:30:16.317

00:30:25.214 --> 00:30:25.234
B

00:30:25.214 --> 00:30:27.556
A green thumb when it comes to cooking.

00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.798
A green thumb for cooking?

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:31.980
Yeah!

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.482
I recently started to eat more healthy.

00:30:35.523 --> 00:30:43.050
So I wanted to, you know, discover all the nice recipes and, you know, try to be creative with food.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.352
Because we need to eat vegetables everyday.

00:30:45.492 --> 00:30:46.433
I love veggies!

00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:48.995
Wait, wait, what's your favorite vegetable?

00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:50.296
Mine's broccoli.

00:30:51.677 --> 00:30:52.118
I like broccoli!

00:30:52.879 --> 00:30:54.580
But do you like Brussels sprouts?

00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:59.535
I was scared for a moment.

00:30:59.555 --> 00:31:02.860
I thought you were going to say like onions or tomatoes.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.243
I don't like onions.

00:31:05.544 --> 00:31:08.308
I hate onions in fact.

00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:13.075
Do you remember when they drugged me in my 3D debut?

00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:13.756
That's right.

00:31:14.076 --> 00:31:15.417
I was holding the cucumber.

00:31:15.437 --> 00:31:16.578
The cucumber though!

00:31:16.598 --> 00:31:22.403
I'm glad I didn't have to hold the onion, but the cucumber is yum.

00:31:22.523 --> 00:31:30.290
I don't want to hold the onion, I'll take the cucumber, thank you!

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.832
What have you been cooking though?

00:31:32.852 --> 00:31:36.195
So yeah, I'm doing meal prep, you know what that is?

00:31:36.215 --> 00:31:36.555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:36.575 --> 00:31:37.916
Meals all at the same time.

00:31:37.936 --> 00:31:39.298
Wait, meal prep?

00:31:39.638 --> 00:31:40.419
Meal prep.

00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:41.039
Meal prep.

00:31:41.239 --> 00:31:42.100
Meal prep.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:49.048
So yeah, I am preparing like every Monday, Tuesday, I prepare like food for the entire week.

00:31:49.088 --> 00:31:57.779
So even if I'm super busy with you know, streaming, recording, and everything else, I still have nice food to eat and ready.

00:31:58.099 --> 00:31:59.121
What's your favorite one?

00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:04.527
My favorite one is my super chicken burrito.

00:32:04.507 --> 00:32:06.569
What's in it?

00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:11.253
High protein, low calorie, and it's super filling.

00:32:12.874 --> 00:32:14.616
Is it all refrigerated or frozen?

00:32:14.756 --> 00:32:19.200
Yeah, you can froze it.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.221
So I cut the chicken, right?

00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:26.826
And I put some sauce, some spice, and like, you know, paprika and everything.

00:32:27.107 --> 00:32:28.648
Is there any lemon in that?

00:32:28.668 --> 00:32:30.830
Yeah, lemon too.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.852
It sounds complicated though.

00:32:32.872 --> 00:32:34.513
No, it takes like 20 minutes.

00:32:34.493 --> 00:32:38.218
Wow, that's about the same amount of time as our meals.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.649
Yeah, we've been having a lot of hot pots.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.935
I put mentaiko in it.

00:32:50.035 --> 00:32:52.859
Have you had mentaiko before?

00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:53.520
I think so.

00:32:54.281 --> 00:32:55.042
It's yummy.

00:32:55.062 --> 00:32:58.126
It's like a spicy cod roe.

00:32:58.146 --> 00:33:00.790
I put komatsuna in it.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:01.791
I love it.

00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:02.492
It's very...

00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:25.189
Mococo.

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:28.550
Smoothie!

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.335
You just said Mococo's tail.

00:33:31.355 --> 00:33:33.158
No, no, no, no!

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:36.523
Smoothie!

00:33:38.687 --> 00:33:42.233
Moco-chan looks like you're gonna have to sleep with one eye open, huh?

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.603
BAU BAU!

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:49.148
BAUIDO!

00:33:49.168 --> 00:33:49.609
That's such good news!

00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:56.139
Ruffians, let's all do our best to maybe try to make some more healthy, vitamin-balanced choices!

00:33:56.159 --> 00:34:00.206
Vitamins, nutrients, all the good stuff.

00:34:00.226 --> 00:34:01.528
Make sure to eat your greenies every day!

00:34:01.548 --> 00:34:03.170
Don't be like, oh I don't like veggies.

00:34:03.271 --> 00:34:04.032
Eat the good ones.

00:34:04.052 --> 00:34:04.753
You'll find them.

00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:08.659
BAU BAU!

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.944
That makes me excited for dinner tonight now.

00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:14.726
Ruffians, don't you want to have dinner?

00:34:14.746 --> 00:34:18.110
You have breakfast though, right?

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:18.691
Breakfast?

00:34:19.051 --> 00:34:19.992
Coffee!

00:34:20.413 --> 00:34:23.076
Coffee is not breakfast!

00:34:23.096 --> 00:34:23.797
Coffee is breakfast.

00:34:23.817 --> 00:34:25.499
It's the best breakfast in the world.

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:26.380
Ruffians, you're with me, right?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.381
Ruffians, you're with me, right?

00:34:28.242 --> 00:34:28.422
Ruffians!

00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:29.083
Ruffians, you're with me, right?

00:34:29.103 --> 00:34:29.283
Ruffians!

00:34:29.303 --> 00:34:29.483

00:34:29.503 --> 00:34:29.684

00:34:29.704 --> 00:34:29.884

00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:30.084

00:34:30.104 --> 00:34:30.284
Ruffians!

00:34:30.304 --> 00:34:30.484
Ruffians!

00:34:30.504 --> 00:34:30.685

00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:30.885

00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:31.085

00:34:31.105 --> 00:34:31.285
Ruffians!

00:34:31.305 --> 00:34:31.486
Ruffians!

00:34:31.506 --> 00:34:31.686
Ruffians!

00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:31.886
Ruffians!

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:32.086
Ruffians!

00:34:32.106 --> 00:34:32.307
Ruffians!

00:34:32.327 --> 00:34:32.507
Ruffians!

00:34:32.527 --> 00:34:32.707
Ruffians!

00:34:32.727 --> 00:34:32.947
Ruffians!

00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:33.168
Ruffians!

00:34:33.888 --> 00:34:34.069
Ruffians!

00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:34.269
Ruffians!

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:34.469
Ruffians!

00:34:34.729 --> 00:34:34.910

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:35.110

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:35.310

00:34:36.772 --> 00:34:36.952
Ruffians!

00:34:36.972 --> 00:34:36.992
R

00:34:37.765 --> 00:34:40.168
Oh man, good!

00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:47.658
You know, maybe there's some Ruffians that haven't had breakfast yet.

00:34:47.678 --> 00:34:51.363
What are we gonna do about that, huh?

00:34:51.603 --> 00:34:57.090
Yeah, maybe you have something that's almost as good as breakfast that you could share.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:01.079
I need energy.

00:35:02.762 --> 00:35:04.807
Yes, I want something.

00:35:05.528 --> 00:35:14.387
I have a cattle.

00:35:14.367 --> 00:35:15.429
Hey, Ruffian!

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.071
Kanto time!

00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:27.948
Some mornings feels like you've just spawned into the day with zero energy, still half asleep while life is already running, and it's totally normal!

00:35:28.408 --> 00:35:40.206
Pause and give yourself a mini reset, slow breath, sip of water, a tiny stretch, maybe a song that you love, and even a silly gif if you want!

00:35:40.186 --> 00:35:43.591
Little things worth, like, tiny powers up!

00:35:43.752 --> 00:35:58.374
And still, even if it's still heavy, you can share a meme, you can reach out, you can text a friend, and you can ask for a hug, and you can watch FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:58.394 --> 00:36:00.397
That's no weakness, okay?

00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:01.880
It's moral healing!

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:08.590
Every step counts, you're doing better than you think, and we're here to cheer you on with

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:12.657

Wow, so elegant.

00:37:13.059 --> 00:37:17.805
Well, now that I'm done, how do you think Furuya BAU BAU is?

00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:19.928
Hmm, let me try.

00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:21.389
BAU BAU.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.911
BAU BAU.

00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.674
I can hear it right from the painting.

00:37:25.595 --> 00:37:25.715
Right?

00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:26.896
Wow.

00:37:26.916 --> 00:37:28.198
Very distinguished.

00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:29.800
Do you think I know it?

00:37:30.141 --> 00:37:31.242
I do, I do.

00:37:31.322 --> 00:37:34.866
Moco-chan would be like BAU BAU!

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:37.690
Hey!

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:43.818
She's so cute.

00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:44.259
So refined.

00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:48.905
Apparently she also has as much energy as Moco-chan.

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:52.390
But she knows you know when to just take a deep breath.

00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:57.537
Take it easy and just sunbathe right in a nice grassy field.

00:37:58.078 --> 00:38:01.523
Now I have her beat.

00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:01.703
BAU BAU!

00:38:01.683 --> 00:38:07.838
And next, we have our corner.

00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:11.808
Today, I went on a walk.

00:38:11.828 --> 00:38:13.593
Ruffians, where are you going?

00:38:13.613 --> 00:38:14.174
Let's take a look.

00:38:15.518 --> 00:38:15.658
De-den!

00:38:16.499 --> 00:38:42.135
I'm so glad you're able to get a nice photo.

00:38:42.115 --> 00:38:43.197
I eat them.

00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:44.319
I eat them.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.125
I eat them.

00:38:47.145 --> 00:38:48.608
I eat them.

00:38:48.628 --> 00:39:02.115
I got the sound of eating snacks!

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:06.093
That's how I eat them.

00:39:06.293 --> 00:39:11.767
I'm glad you're able to have such a nice time and thank you for watching before too!

00:39:11.787 --> 00:39:11.948
BAU BAU!

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:17.281
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:20.028
Let's see!

00:39:20.048 --> 00:39:20.188
De-den!

00:39:20.168 --> 00:39:24.395
Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:39:24.475 --> 00:39:32.789
With Hashtag HOLOCTOBER starting again soon, Iofi-senpai sent a drawing prompt advice.

00:39:33.049 --> 00:39:41.303
With HOLOCTOBER starting again soon, I was wondering what prompt you would pick if you were in charge of choosing one.

00:39:41.323 --> 00:39:44.168
I'm excited to see lots of more FUWAMOCO art soon!

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:59.473
Maybe there's some Ruffians that haven't played a whole October before.

00:40:37.688 --> 00:40:37.768
31?

00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:37.868
31?

00:40:37.888 --> 00:40:38.049
31?

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.129

00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:38.309

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.870
31?

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:38.950
31?

00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:39.591
31?

00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:39.751
31?

00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:39.891
31?

00:40:40.112 --> 00:40:40.713
31?

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:40.793
31?

00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:40.873
31?

00:40:40.893 --> 00:40:40.953
31?

00:40:40.973 --> 00:40:41.033
31?

00:40:41.053 --> 00:40:41.113
31?

00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:41.194
31?

00:40:41.214 --> 00:40:41.274
31?

00:40:41.294 --> 00:40:41.354
31?

00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:41.434
31?

00:40:41.454 --> 00:40:41.514
31?

00:40:41.534 --> 00:40:41.594
31?

00:40:41.614 --> 00:40:41.674
31?

00:40:41.694 --> 00:40:41.754
31?

00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:41.835
31?

00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:41.915
31?

00:40:41.935 --> 00:40:42.135
31?

00:40:42.155 --> 00:40:42.215

00:40:42.235 --> 00:40:42.295
31?

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:42.375

00:40:42.556 --> 00:40:42.616
31?

00:40:42.636 --> 00:40:42.696
31?

00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:42.776

00:40:42.796 --> 00:40:42.856
31?

00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:43.117
31?

00:40:43.137 --> 00:40:43.197
31?

00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:43.277
31?

00:40:43.297 --> 00:40:43.357
31?

00:40:43.377 --> 00:40:43.437
31?

00:40:43.457 --> 00:40:43.517
31?

00:40:43.537 --> 00:40:43.597
31?

00:40:43.617 --> 00:40:43.677
31?

00:40:43.697 --> 00:40:43.758
31?

00:40:43.778 --> 00:40:43.838
31?

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:43.918
31?

00:40:43.938 --> 00:40:43.998
31?

00:40:44.018 --> 00:40:44.078
31?

00:40:44.098 --> 00:40:44.158
31?

00:40:44.178 --> 00:40:44.238
31?

00:40:44.258 --> 00:40:44.318
31?

00:40:44.338 --> 00:40:44.399
31?

00:40:44.419 --> 00:40:44.479
31?

00:40:44.499 --> 00:40:44.559
31?

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:44.639
31?

00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:44.719
31?

00:40:44.739 --> 00:40:44.799
31?

00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:44.879
31?

00:40:44.899 --> 00:40:44.959
31?

00:40:44.979 --> 00:40:45.040
31?

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.140
31?

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.220
31?

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.340
31?

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:45.420
31?

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:45.500
31?

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:45.640
31?

00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:45.721
31?

00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:45.801
31?

00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:45.901
31?

00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:45.981
31?

00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:55.363
How about you, Fuwawa?

00:40:58.415 --> 00:41:05.991
Maybe one going back in time to the Showa period or something, you know what?

00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:07.394
Showa era!

00:41:07.414 --> 00:41:07.875
Time to heal F, right?

00:41:07.895 --> 00:41:11.562
Maybe like Dagashiya, like the old Japanese sweets shop?

00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:15.270
Yeah, that'd be cute!

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.192
It'd be cool to have a red door!

00:41:16.212 --> 00:41:19.258
We have Showa era, we could have Seiko-chan cuts.

00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:23.670
Can you imagine that?

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.974
All of us are seiko-chan kai.

00:41:26.994 --> 00:41:28.916
Can you imagine that?

00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.018
Seiko-shi's a baby.

00:41:31.118 --> 00:41:31.619
Oh, I know.

00:41:31.639 --> 00:41:33.141
Moco-chan, what about you?

00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:34.462
What about you, Moco-chan?

00:41:34.943 --> 00:41:41.710
Maybe... Wait, squeamish with a green bangle.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:46.596
And I... Socks and then I... Band-aid on the knee.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.752
Maybe red glasses.

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:50.995
That's all!

00:41:51.015 --> 00:41:52.497
Wow, that's a long one, Moco-chan.

00:41:52.517 --> 00:41:54.539
I think you said the same thing.

00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:55.681
Because it's cute.

00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:56.863
It's a good comedy.

00:41:57.003 --> 00:41:58.905
Idol, police, those kind of things.

00:41:59.746 --> 00:42:02.250
One prompt is different than the others.

00:42:03.972 --> 00:42:04.673
That's all, chan.

00:42:04.693 --> 00:42:06.235
We welcome all prompts.

00:42:07.357 --> 00:42:08.558
I got it today, bro.

00:42:08.879 --> 00:42:09.900
Thank you.

00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:12.087
Pumpkin skirt.

00:42:12.107 --> 00:42:16.759
Pumpkin skirt?

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.889
Pumpkin skirt is also very cute.

00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:25.301
We can't wait to see how everybody gets up to that.

00:42:25.321 --> 00:42:27.045
Thank you Iohei-senpai for always

00:42:27.025 --> 00:42:51.945
FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together with you.

00:42:52.385 --> 00:42:53.387
So that means

00:42:53.367 --> 00:42:57.194
We're always looking for more doggy of the days!

00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:03.225
By seeing your walks, photos of your walks that you've been going on, your adventures!

00:43:03.245 --> 00:43:04.287
Send us your questions!

00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:06.451
Send us your questions!

00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:08.475
We know you have lots of questions.

00:43:08.715 --> 00:43:13.384
And also you know if you happen to see a Pero Sighting, it's probably best to report it.

00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:17.678
You can use the hashtag!

00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:24.430
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:43:24.631 --> 00:43:27.977

00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:36.452
We have...

00:43:37.765 --> 00:43:59.824
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.247
I don't know.

00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:05.175
There's a link on Twitter, you can ask us there!

00:44:05.195 --> 00:44:07.099
And we'll do our best to answer them!

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:09.023
Oh I guess I should put it in the description.

00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:09.785
Oh I guess, huh?

00:44:09.865 --> 00:44:12.410
I guess that would've been helpful, FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:44:14.455 --> 00:44:18.744
Ruffians, go to- Oh, you submitted yours too!

00:44:19.165 --> 00:44:19.365
Thank you!

00:44:19.345 --> 00:44:24.774
We'll be taking a final look at it soon, so please send us your questions, okay?

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:25.915
Make sure, okay?

00:44:25.936 --> 00:44:27.538
Sooner than later is best, always.

00:44:27.558 --> 00:44:30.202
Yeah, and we'll be doing it at 6 p.m.

00:44:30.523 --> 00:44:37.394
PT tonight, so we hope to see you there!

00:44:37.414 --> 00:44:37.634
Bye bye!

00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:45.707
