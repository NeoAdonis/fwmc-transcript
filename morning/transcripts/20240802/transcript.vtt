Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:26.258 --> 05:27.499

05:27.519 --> 05:29.640
Too quiet now.

05:30.481 --> 05:31.501

05:31.541 --> 05:32.102
Like this!

05:33.274 --> 05:33.894
BAU BAU!

05:33.914 --> 05:37.176
One more time, okay?

05:37.196 --> 05:37.396
Okay.

05:37.736 --> 05:39.637
Moco-chan, can we do the thing where we jump out again?

05:39.717 --> 05:40.297
Oh, okay.

05:41.057 --> 05:41.478
One second.

05:43.599 --> 05:43.899
Okay.

05:44.399 --> 05:44.659
Okay.

05:48.421 --> 05:50.982

Are you sure it's not too loud?

06:02.307 --> 06:02.447
No!

06:07.178 --> 06:09.258
I love his ears dying.

06:09.278 --> 06:10.299

06:11.359 --> 06:12.800
High five!

06:21.480 --> 06:23.061
Well, hopefully it's good now.

06:25.642 --> 06:29.624
Well, now that we're not destroying the Ruffians.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.445
Ruffians!

06:32.226 --> 06:36.248
Today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:37.028 --> 06:39.030
BAU BAU!

06:39.450 --> 06:46.053
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 113th episode!

06:46.213 --> 06:47.094
BAU BAU!

06:50.075 --> 06:51.456
We're not super loud today!

06:51.536 --> 06:53.057
You never know what's gonna happen.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.098
It's a lovely day and we got more fans!

06:56.118 --> 06:56.958
BAU BAU!

07:02.721 --> 07:14.165
For Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

07:14.545 --> 07:17.666
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

07:17.686 --> 07:20.827
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

07:21.207 --> 07:24.071
I hope you start your day off on the right paw.

07:24.091 --> 07:29.758
Tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

07:30.158 --> 07:34.183
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:34.204 --> 07:34.944
BAU BAU!

07:38.288 --> 07:39.789
Thank you, Ruffians!

07:39.829 --> 07:42.149
Yeah, it's short format.

07:42.209 --> 07:42.750
Thank you.

07:42.770 --> 07:43.850
It is!

07:43.970 --> 07:45.330
I will show you how short it is.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.151
Okay.

07:46.171 --> 07:48.891
BAU BAU!

07:50.152 --> 07:52.252
It just started!

07:52.593 --> 07:58.154
Today's FUWAMOCO Morning just started, but the week is coming to a close, right?

07:58.174 --> 08:00.135
But that doesn't mean that the fun is over!

08:00.195 --> 08:01.155
No!

08:01.595 --> 08:04.276
And how are we gonna have fun this weekend, Moco-chan?

08:04.416 --> 08:06.577
We're gonna start with

08:08.422 --> 08:09.362
Pero Sighting.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.883
That's not fun though.

08:12.643 --> 08:14.163
Is that fun, Ruffians?

08:17.984 --> 08:20.345
I'm asking seriously right now.

08:20.445 --> 08:20.885
No.

08:21.745 --> 08:23.046
The Ruffians say no.

08:23.346 --> 08:23.746
No.

08:24.166 --> 08:24.606
No.

08:25.366 --> 08:25.746
Yeah.

08:26.546 --> 08:26.846
Yes.

08:27.267 --> 08:27.567
Yes.

08:27.827 --> 08:28.727
Yes, it's surprising.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.167
Yes, it's fun.

08:30.647 --> 08:31.428
Nuh-uh.

08:32.088 --> 08:34.668
Well, let's hear it here this time!

08:34.888 --> 08:35.208
Okay.

08:35.449 --> 08:35.749
Okay.

08:36.509 --> 08:37.189
De-den.

08:41.184 --> 08:41.645
De-den!

08:43.946 --> 08:50.531
I don't know, Ruffians.

08:51.312 --> 08:54.214
Seems like Pero wasn't seen anywhere.

08:55.195 --> 08:55.915
Ruffians.

08:57.116 --> 08:58.797
Is this our fault?

09:02.366 --> 09:03.646
Well, we're safe today.

09:03.726 --> 09:04.527
Well, that's good.

09:04.547 --> 09:08.908
You know, now we're into our second year here at hololive.

09:09.548 --> 09:12.889
Maybe... Maybe this is a year without Pero.

09:12.909 --> 09:15.249
I don't know.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.210
Tell the truth.

09:17.230 --> 09:21.251
I feel kinda sad, you know?

09:22.511 --> 09:22.991
I don't know.

09:24.232 --> 09:25.212
Feels a little bit...

09:27.817 --> 09:28.698
It'll be okay.

09:28.978 --> 09:31.660
We're strong demon guard dogs, right, Moco-chan?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.321
We are the BAU BAU team by ourselves!

09:33.381 --> 09:34.042
Yeah.

09:34.262 --> 09:35.823
BAU BAU.

09:35.883 --> 09:36.563
BAU BAU!

09:36.583 --> 09:39.025
Let's not think about those things.

09:39.165 --> 09:39.906
Yeah, no.

09:40.046 --> 09:40.226
Yeah.

09:40.266 --> 09:43.368
BAU BAU!

09:43.489 --> 09:43.969
BAU BAU!

09:44.009 --> 09:45.130
FUWAMOCO for you!

09:45.290 --> 09:51.334
Yeah, like I mentioned, we are now officially into our second year here in hololive!

09:51.414 --> 09:56.338
Because just the other day, we celebrated our first anniversary!

09:56.498 --> 09:57.499
BAU BAU!

09:59.607 --> 10:01.709
It was big, huh?

10:02.210 --> 10:03.572
I don't know, you know what?

10:04.112 --> 10:07.036
I'm just so happy to be able to celebrate it together with you.

10:07.276 --> 10:10.340
Already one year has gone by.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.466
I don't know, it still doesn't really connect.

10:15.475 --> 10:17.857
I feel like every day I'm like, how?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.159
How am I so lucky, huh?

10:20.279 --> 10:20.959
Right.

10:21.460 --> 10:29.866
But I think now, now that we've been at hololive for one year, I think now we're starting to feel... I remember hololive.

10:29.886 --> 10:30.087
Me too.

10:30.107 --> 10:30.367
Me too.

10:30.407 --> 10:30.807

Me too.

10:41.456 --> 10:41.596
Me too.

10:41.656 --> 10:41.816
Me too.

10:41.836 --> 10:41.996
Me too.

10:42.016 --> 10:42.136
Me too.

10:42.156 --> 10:42.296
Me too.

10:42.316 --> 10:42.456
Me too.

10:42.496 --> 10:42.636
Me too.

10:42.677 --> 10:42.857
Me too.

10:42.897 --> 10:43.077
Me too.

10:43.117 --> 10:43.337
Me too.

10:43.357 --> 10:43.557
Me too.

10:43.577 --> 10:43.797
Me too.

10:43.817 --> 10:43.938
Me too.

10:43.958 --> 10:44.138
Me too.

10:44.158 --> 10:44.318
Me too

10:45.905 --> 10:46.465
I don't know.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.488
The brain is gonna burst.

10:52.008 --> 10:52.848
It's BAU BAU.

10:52.868 --> 10:56.450
And BAU time hasn't helped yet either.

10:56.830 --> 10:56.970
No.

10:57.050 --> 11:04.193
But Ruffians, we really just can't wait for another year filled with precious memories.

11:04.334 --> 11:11.497
Precious memories that we're able to make so precious because of you here with us, Ruffians.

11:12.262 --> 11:13.763
Thank you!

11:13.783 --> 11:16.365
We're gonna keep on protecting your smile!

11:16.726 --> 11:17.206
But!

11:17.826 --> 11:22.590
In case Ruffians, you know, there's a bunch of Ruffians I think a little bit busy.

11:22.710 --> 11:29.616
Maybe you wanna know just what kind of exciting things we're up to in our first anniversary celebration!

11:29.776 --> 11:37.062
Well, it wouldn't quite be FUWAMOCO without us singing a bunch of our favorite songs this time!

11:37.122 --> 11:40.004
Special songs, you know, that we sung back when we

11:40.184 --> 11:41.825
First debut!

11:42.225 --> 11:46.948
But we did sing Sirens!

11:47.028 --> 11:48.769
Sirens!

11:48.969 --> 11:52.191
And of course we also looked over our debut as well!

11:52.231 --> 11:54.713
That was something.

11:54.773 --> 11:55.774
Nervous, FUWAMOCO.

11:55.954 --> 11:57.315
Can you do an introduction?

11:59.644 --> 12:02.047
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

12:02.648 --> 12:05.552
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.636
Together we're FUWAMOCO!

12:09.257 --> 12:10.158
BAU BAU!

12:13.003 --> 12:13.523
Yeah.

12:13.563 --> 12:13.803
Yeah.

12:14.163 --> 12:22.626
I think we're much, much more FUWAMOCO-y about being comfortable here with the FUWAMOCOs now.

12:22.666 --> 12:22.826
Right!

12:23.266 --> 12:23.546
Yeah.

12:23.706 --> 12:24.606
BAU BAU!

12:24.666 --> 12:25.766
BAU BAU!

12:25.786 --> 12:27.707
Yeah, a little bit low-key, low-edgy.

12:27.787 --> 12:29.087
Low-tension one.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.388
Yeah.

12:30.408 --> 12:30.468
But!

12:31.388 --> 12:32.588
But!

12:32.908 --> 12:38.730
You know, we also revealed first anniversary merchandise!

12:40.091 --> 12:42.532
Let's take a look, okay?

12:42.552 --> 12:44.193
We have Icomochi-mama!

12:44.333 --> 12:45.554
Icomochi-mama juice!

12:45.614 --> 12:49.376
BAU BAU!

12:49.416 --> 12:50.397
Let's take a look, okay?

12:50.557 --> 12:55.039
So this is the complete set of our first anniversary merch.

12:55.059 --> 13:01.743
We have our Happy Puppy Happy, our BAU BAU Whiskey Chain Pero plushie, FUWAMOCO glass set, and the bonus.

13:02.023 --> 13:02.863
Close up.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.043
See?

13:03.063 --> 13:03.864
Right here!

13:04.464 --> 13:16.573
Wow, for the Ruffians, you know, some Ruffians are able to get their paws on the limited edition, which comes with a handwritten autograph of both myself, Moco-chan, too!

13:16.613 --> 13:18.275
FUWAMOCO!

13:18.355 --> 13:19.416
Together!

13:20.156 --> 13:24.119
And for Ruffians, you know, so I want the complete set!

13:24.239 --> 13:27.222
It comes with a duplicated foil stamp autograph as well.

13:27.262 --> 13:28.823
Which is very, very nice to me.

13:28.883 --> 13:32.105
Yeah, so you'll be able to display that, and you know...

13:34.207 --> 13:35.828
How was that?

13:35.929 --> 13:38.731
Yeah, here's our happy puppy!

13:38.831 --> 13:40.792
Is this the first time you've seen a happy before?

13:40.813 --> 13:44.215
It's definitely not the first time you've seen a happy puppy, huh?

13:44.255 --> 13:45.296
Yeah, no, definitely not.

13:45.676 --> 13:52.982
But a happy is something that you can wear at live performances and cheers or conventions, you know?

13:53.963 --> 14:00.673
I know anyone will see you from like a mile away and be like, oh, that's a Ruffian, huh?

14:00.733 --> 14:05.440
It's very, very cute, especially because of Icomochi-mama's illustration.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.324
And you know, they're very particular about the designs.

14:08.905 --> 14:09.245
Yes.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.427
So please take a look at it.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.729
It's gonna be very fluffy and fuzzy.

14:16.769 --> 14:18.950
We wanna see all your happy looking!

14:18.990 --> 14:23.012
We wanna see just how happy puppies you are, Ruffians, wearing the happy puppy outfit.

14:23.032 --> 14:23.532
BAU BAU!

14:23.712 --> 14:24.873
And next!

14:25.453 --> 14:27.896
Yeah, the BAU BAU voice teacher!

14:28.136 --> 14:31.881
With a super cute illustration by Reriko-san!

14:31.941 --> 14:35.285
And there's six original voice recordings in it!

14:35.485 --> 14:37.668
I wonder what it could be, huh?

14:38.268 --> 14:39.970
But you can bring us with you everywhere!

14:39.990 --> 14:40.371
Everywhere!

14:40.391 --> 14:42.053
We'll protect your smile!

14:42.073 --> 14:45.177
When you're feeling a bit like, uh, my BAU BAU voice is not good!

14:46.486 --> 14:47.967
Just press it and it'll be there.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.869
With the original voice.

14:50.129 --> 14:50.870
The greetings!

14:51.450 --> 14:53.272
They all have to find out what they are.

14:53.672 --> 14:54.493
BAU BAU!

14:54.693 --> 14:55.434
And next!

14:56.795 --> 14:57.395
Nasty.

14:59.757 --> 15:00.058
Nasty.

15:00.518 --> 15:03.260
Ruffians, you really wanted a Pero plushie.

15:03.881 --> 15:04.561
Here it is!

15:05.362 --> 15:07.144
It's unfortunately terribly cute.

15:07.944 --> 15:09.185
And it's life-size.

15:09.566 --> 15:10.727
Pero life-size.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.576
He'll be so perilous.

15:13.616 --> 15:16.739
He's a bit bigger than the Ruffians, but, uh, yeah.

15:17.379 --> 15:20.142
Unfortunately, I came out really, really cute.

15:20.242 --> 15:21.202
He's round.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.724
He's too cute.

15:22.824 --> 15:23.845
I'm very cute.

15:23.945 --> 15:24.185
Yeah.

15:25.439 --> 15:26.220
One peron, yes.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.562
So you want to make sure that you bring home your own peron pussy!

15:29.682 --> 15:32.344
So that you can kick it and punch it and point it!

15:32.644 --> 15:35.406
Do whatever you want with violent toys.

15:35.506 --> 15:36.046
Violence.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.227
Extreme violence.

15:37.347 --> 15:38.728
Extreme violence!

15:38.968 --> 15:40.169
So it's a cute peron pussy.

15:40.209 --> 15:41.210
Yeah!

15:41.390 --> 15:45.533
And next, we have the FUWAMOCO glass set!

15:45.793 --> 15:48.935
You can drink two different types of drinks at the same time.

15:49.055 --> 15:49.215
Yeah!

15:49.275 --> 15:52.157
If you forgetful, or you know a glass and then Mocococo.

15:52.757 --> 15:54.819
Water in one, tea in another.

15:55.639 --> 15:58.061
Milk in one, orange juice in the other.

15:58.081 --> 15:59.202
Maybe not that.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.612
You won't get confused, right?

16:02.632 --> 16:03.913
They're very different drinks.

16:04.513 --> 16:05.074
Yeah!

16:05.174 --> 16:08.536
Yeah, but you can drink from them while having a donut.

16:08.597 --> 16:10.878
Yeah, we're watching us here.

16:10.898 --> 16:15.782
So you know, first thing in the morning, you gotta have an ice coffee during FUWAMOCO Morning.

16:15.802 --> 16:16.883
You can choose.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.105
Oh, today it's gonna be the Fuwawa glass.

16:19.365 --> 16:24.229
Maybe on the Wednesday, FUWAMOCO Morning, the Pup Talk, you drink out of the Moco-chan glass.

16:25.950 --> 16:26.711
It's up to you!

16:26.731 --> 16:31.573
And that's our anniversary!

16:31.613 --> 16:33.254
We still on sale!

16:33.334 --> 16:38.537
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for getting your paws on the limited edition set!

16:39.017 --> 16:43.819
We're so excited for you to be able to take a look at our signatures.

16:43.859 --> 16:47.821
We're gonna put a lot of our hearts into them!

16:47.962 --> 16:51.163
Thank you, Ruffians!

16:51.223 --> 16:52.164
But that wasn't it!

16:52.184 --> 16:53.204
That was a surprise.

16:54.905 --> 16:56.527
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

17:14.583 --> 17:18.007
The most surprising, the most exciting thing happened!

17:18.027 --> 17:19.328
FUWAMOCO!

17:19.348 --> 17:22.451
We released our first original song!

17:22.471 --> 17:23.192
Yeah!

17:23.352 --> 17:24.033
BAU BAU!

17:24.353 --> 17:27.777
The song is titled, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★!

17:27.837 --> 17:28.357
BAU BAU!

17:30.030 --> 17:33.033
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

17:45.527 --> 17:50.290
Ruffians, despite what you think, it's very nice and high quality.

18:12.762 --> 18:13.743
This is not our 3D debut.

18:13.803 --> 18:16.626
It's not our 3D debut.

18:16.906 --> 18:18.188
Wait, they dance!

18:18.248 --> 18:19.188
Yes, they dance!

18:19.209 --> 18:21.291
With FUWAMOCO, of course they dance!

18:23.240 --> 18:27.122
Please don't get confused, that is still yet to come.

18:27.963 --> 18:33.987
But now Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★ is streaming on music platforms everywhere!

18:34.047 --> 18:36.288
So you can listen to it wherever you want!

18:36.728 --> 18:41.071
Please go and pick your favorite service, pick the place you listen to music.

18:41.091 --> 18:43.532
Favorite it and listen, and listen, and listen, and listen.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.994
Please, Ruffians!

18:47.335 --> 18:51.157
And also, we had a bit of an afterparty for the rest.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.279
Yeah, what did we do at the after party?

18:53.319 --> 18:57.021
Yeah, there was a complete doggy boot camp.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.743
Yeah, training session.

18:58.783 --> 19:04.027
Yeah, and we taught all of Ruffians how to cheer the best way possibly for us.

19:04.047 --> 19:05.048
Doing calls.

19:05.168 --> 19:09.291
Yeah, you know, calls is something that they do at idol performances a lot.

19:09.731 --> 19:13.855
And there's a lot of places where you can BAU BAU and FUWAMOCO.

19:14.415 --> 19:14.955
Dang it.

19:14.975 --> 19:20.459
So we wanted to do it all together with you Ruffians so that you'll be ready wherever you go.

19:20.819 --> 19:24.281
And maybe like, uh... Now?

19:24.401 --> 19:25.002
Now!

19:25.362 --> 19:26.422
We'll do it now!

19:26.523 --> 19:29.544
Let's do it once more right now, okay?

19:30.305 --> 19:31.526
Okay, Ruffians!

19:31.706 --> 19:34.648

Unleash the tiger within you!

22:36.018 --> 22:36.138
Yes!

22:36.518 --> 22:36.858
Yes!

22:37.138 --> 22:37.998
Yes tiger!

22:38.098 --> 22:38.999
Wahoo!

22:39.319 --> 22:40.179
Come on!

22:40.599 --> 22:43.680
Fuwa fuwa fuwa fuwa!

22:43.740 --> 22:44.140

BAU BAU!

23:24.556 --> 23:27.918
That is how you BAU BAU to the max!

23:30.459 --> 23:32.659
BAU BAU!

23:32.699 --> 23:38.602
We hope you have a bunch of fun and that you'll be able to internalize it into your heart.

23:38.662 --> 23:44.404
Yeah, I know it's all of a sudden first thing in the morning, but... But basically, you know, it's like a... What's it?

23:44.484 --> 23:46.025
A radio exercise?

23:46.045 --> 23:46.505
You know?

23:46.525 --> 23:47.005
Right, right.

23:47.465 --> 23:49.567
Punch to the left, punch to the right.

23:49.587 --> 23:51.970
It's still not quite in your head yet, that's fine.

23:51.990 --> 23:52.970
That's okay.

23:53.011 --> 23:54.272
You just learned it, okay?

23:54.312 --> 23:57.695
We're so happy Ruffians!

23:57.755 --> 23:58.135
BAU BAU!

24:03.080 --> 24:05.861
I hope that you know, BAU DEM!

24:06.161 --> 24:13.062
Not only will the calls be in your heart, but that the BAU BAU will be stuck in your brain forever and ever!

24:13.082 --> 24:13.822
Yeah!

24:13.982 --> 24:15.662
It's pretty catchy, you know?

24:16.242 --> 24:18.583
You know, I'm actually sort of curious.

24:18.763 --> 24:18.903
Oh?

24:19.603 --> 24:22.263
I feel like it'd be cool to have a metal version.

24:22.663 --> 24:23.264
A metal?

24:23.284 --> 24:24.664
Yeah, a metal version.

24:24.684 --> 24:25.344
FUWAMOCO!

24:25.384 --> 24:26.204
FUWAMOCO!

24:26.244 --> 24:26.864
FUWAMOCO!

24:26.884 --> 24:27.864
FUWAMOCO!

24:27.924 --> 24:28.304
Like that?

24:28.344 --> 24:28.644
Yeah.

24:29.005 --> 24:29.225
Oh.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.563
Maybe the Ruffians have to take care of that!

24:36.643 --> 24:37.204
Heck yeah!

24:37.224 --> 24:41.230
How does the heck time become like sweet time?

24:41.250 --> 24:44.414
I don't know.

24:45.676 --> 24:48.360
That's something that maybe you can think of, Ruffians!

24:49.021 --> 24:49.622
BAU BAU!

24:50.660 --> 24:52.941
Please listen to Bunch of My Senpai!

24:53.021 --> 24:55.043
Lots and lots of camoflague!

24:55.063 --> 24:57.524
BAU BAU!

24:58.885 --> 25:03.607
With all that excitement, there's also been something exciting going on too!

25:04.388 --> 25:09.451
Lots of us hololive members, we're a part of HoloARC!

25:09.791 --> 25:11.672
We're playing a game called ARC.

25:11.712 --> 25:16.075
You know, with the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs, and more dinosaurs.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.276
Together with a bunch of my senpai in a huge event!

25:20.437 --> 25:25.179
Members from JP, members from EN, like us, Karina-chan.

25:25.199 --> 25:26.560
Yeah, me too.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.901
It was so much fun!

25:28.921 --> 25:33.543
We got to have our dinosaurs, and then we did big raids all together.

25:33.624 --> 25:38.246
Yeah, but on the very last day, the final day, we fought a new dinosaur.

25:38.266 --> 25:40.947
It's not a dinosaur, really.

25:41.327 --> 25:42.608
It's a snowy owl.

25:43.451 --> 25:44.651
Dinosaur.

25:44.792 --> 25:45.612
It's a funny story.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.672
It's very cute.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.353
I guess it's a dinosaur.

25:48.373 --> 25:53.034
We were part of the healing team, which is us and Hiroha-senpai.

25:53.054 --> 25:57.996
Hiroha-senpai was an amazing, amazing leader for it.

25:58.316 --> 26:02.178
We were able to heal both Jumai-senpai!

26:02.218 --> 26:05.879
We did well and we beat the final raid too, even though it was a bit tough.

26:06.119 --> 26:07.581
It was really scary.

26:07.701 --> 26:08.382
Really silly.

26:08.402 --> 26:09.322
I was like, oh, it's done.

26:09.342 --> 26:10.183
No, it's not.

26:10.203 --> 26:14.087
Suddenly, right before the radio, the dinosaurs are busy taking a bath.

26:14.488 --> 26:15.469
They're still having dinner.

26:16.949 --> 26:17.489
What's with that?

26:17.710 --> 26:18.130
Huh?

26:18.651 --> 26:18.991
Huh?

26:20.132 --> 26:20.532
Huh?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.174
Here I am waiting.

26:23.095 --> 26:23.675
Waiting!

26:23.775 --> 26:31.963
Because we got to talk with Yuruha-senpai a bunch about our favorite ice creams and tea ceremony and a bunch of silly things.

26:32.403 --> 26:38.789
But we were just so happy because even though it was a pretty tricky game, we were complete beginners in everything.

26:39.329 --> 26:42.550
We were just so happy to be able to get to know our senpai more.

26:42.570 --> 26:47.151
We were able to get closer and bond and everything.

26:47.751 --> 26:50.052
You know, that wasn't cool.

26:51.232 --> 26:55.254
The dinosaurs are cute, but our senpai were cuter.

26:55.274 --> 26:56.594
But next time, FUWAMOCO-chan.

26:57.014 --> 26:58.895
Our dinosaurs.

27:05.623 --> 27:07.704
We should get them with our own paws, you know?

27:08.264 --> 27:09.465
Oh, I don't know how!

27:09.765 --> 27:12.306
They were given to us by our senpai.

27:12.326 --> 27:12.726
Yeah.

27:12.786 --> 27:14.327
They're like, oh, I have something cute.

27:14.387 --> 27:16.168
Give it to FUWAMOCO, you know?

27:16.308 --> 27:16.728
Yeah.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.449
I'm happy, but... I appreciate it.

27:18.709 --> 27:22.271
We need to show that, you know, we're independent demon dolls.

27:22.311 --> 27:22.871
Yeah.

27:23.091 --> 27:24.792
We're self-sufficient, right?

27:24.812 --> 27:25.552
Hand-me-downs.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.393
No, they weren't hand-me-downs.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.534
They were presents, okay?

27:28.554 --> 27:31.135
Precious, precious presents, yeah.

27:31.795 --> 27:36.221
But I really hope that we can play a game together again soon.

27:36.702 --> 27:37.904
It was really fun.

27:38.164 --> 27:40.387
You know, just like the spelling bee was.

27:40.407 --> 27:43.511
I hope we can do more big collabs soon!

27:43.531 --> 27:44.232
BAU BAU!

27:45.937 --> 27:50.838
Thank you to Pekora-senpai and to all the staff that helped organize it.

27:51.318 --> 27:53.339
Thank you, thank you!

27:53.439 --> 27:56.239
BAU BAU!

27:56.820 --> 27:57.900
And well, you know what?

27:58.160 --> 28:01.901
That was one thing that we did in summer here that was very fun.

28:02.221 --> 28:03.961
But the summer still continues!

28:03.981 --> 28:05.202
It's still young!

28:05.942 --> 28:15.624
And to continue the funness of summer, not just the summer of Advent, but hololive city has now started!

28:16.004 --> 28:17.986
BAU BAU!

28:18.046 --> 28:20.408
Ruffians, do you remember hololive City?

28:20.488 --> 28:24.191
We talked about it briefly before, but maybe it's a bit hard to remember.

28:24.471 --> 28:26.793
A few months ago we talked about it.

28:26.813 --> 28:34.219
hololive City is basically hololive teaming up together with a bunch of theme parks all across Japan.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.821
Greetings, hololive city.

28:36.861 --> 28:38.302
This is an amazing collab!

28:38.722 --> 28:50.728
And this time, FUWAMOCO, we're part of hololive city and we're representing hololive at Tokyo Dome City Attraction!

28:51.028 --> 28:52.789
Look at all our senpai!

28:52.869 --> 28:53.369
Amazing!

28:54.510 --> 28:55.751
FUWAMOCO

29:13.777 --> 29:21.640
We're just so happy because we've seen a bunch of Ruffians, you know, having fun running around Tokyo Dome City, eating our shaved ice.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.681
Yeah, the FUWAMOCO shaved ice!

29:23.721 --> 29:25.042
And BAU BAU donuts!

29:25.122 --> 29:26.802
Yeah, we have BAU BAU donuts!

29:26.942 --> 29:29.243
They're super cute!

29:29.964 --> 29:35.066
And actually, you know, we've seen some Ruffians be like, I wanted to get the donuts, but...

29:35.786 --> 29:38.347
I wasn't able to get my paws on them.

29:38.727 --> 29:40.348
They sold out.

29:40.368 --> 29:41.528
I'm sorry.

29:42.209 --> 29:47.671
But the shaved ice is very fluffy, very fuzzy, so we recommend that too.

29:48.131 --> 29:51.032
But, you know, that's not just the Ruffians.

29:51.332 --> 29:57.555
There's actually more Ruffians saying that, oh, I can't get my paws on FUWAMOCO's merchandise.

29:58.940 --> 30:05.133
Somehow, some of our merch is already sold out despite it being the second day of the event.

30:05.514 --> 30:07.839
Why are our acrylic stands going high?

30:09.901 --> 30:11.582
Thank you, Ruffians!

30:11.662 --> 30:13.563
We're really sorry!

30:13.643 --> 30:17.146
We're really sorry, Ruffians, for couldn't get done.

30:17.166 --> 30:20.208
Yeah, we really hope that there's a restock soon.

30:20.448 --> 30:24.210
And also, a lot more Ruffians can get their paws on us too!

30:24.390 --> 30:30.074
And then we can travel all together around Tokyo Dome City attractions!

30:30.674 --> 30:31.435
It's gonna be fun.

30:32.295 --> 30:36.878
Also make sure that you go on our rides of Hoppin' Droppin'.

30:37.138 --> 30:39.240
It's not a kid's ride.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.781
Droppin' is scary.

30:40.961 --> 30:42.062
It's serious, okay?

30:42.302 --> 30:45.844
And on that way, you can also hear us BAU BAU!

30:45.944 --> 30:46.665
BAU BAU!

30:46.685 --> 30:47.565
While you ride it.

30:47.625 --> 30:48.826
And maybe some music as well.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.508
Huh?

30:51.568 --> 30:53.710
Lots and lots of fun secrets!

30:53.810 --> 30:56.452
If you're visiting Tokyo, please come on by!

30:56.473 --> 31:07.202
The hololive city is going to be here until September, so hopefully you know if you have a fun summer trip coming up, you can stop on by!

31:07.342 --> 31:09.804
BAU BAU!

31:10.564 --> 31:11.065
I'm so excited.

31:12.066 --> 31:13.947
I want to see even more photos of FUWAMOCO!

31:13.987 --> 31:15.047
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it!

31:15.267 --> 31:16.288
Would you ride that ride?

31:16.588 --> 31:16.848
Yes!

31:17.169 --> 31:17.689
Of course!

31:17.769 --> 31:18.690
Hoppin' droppin'.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.190
Of course!

31:19.210 --> 31:20.591
FUWAMOCO would ride that ride.

31:20.611 --> 31:22.192
You can't just leave droppin' like that.

31:22.212 --> 31:22.652
No!

31:22.852 --> 31:23.613
He's hoppin'.

31:23.673 --> 31:24.393
He's hoppin'.

31:24.433 --> 31:25.834
You have to be hoppin' too!

31:25.974 --> 31:26.354
Yeah.

31:26.654 --> 31:28.255
Hop on to droppin'.

31:28.516 --> 31:28.936
Yeah.

31:29.416 --> 31:30.817
Yeah.

31:30.877 --> 31:34.359
But, speaking of hoppin', I'm kinda hoppin' down.

31:34.679 --> 31:40.083
Excitement and nervousness, because... Advent's 3D debut is...

31:41.742 --> 31:42.623
Can you believe it?

31:42.643 --> 31:53.292
Ruffians, tonight... Tonight is a big day, but you know, it's just a few days after our first anniversary, right?

31:53.372 --> 31:53.772
Yeah.

31:54.473 --> 31:57.536
And Advent's 3D debuts are really soon!

31:57.596 --> 31:58.076
Yeah.

31:59.017 --> 32:05.863
In fact, you know, Biboo, her 3D debut is two days away.

32:05.903 --> 32:06.163
Two days.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.406
But, two days, I... It's hard to believe.

32:09.987 --> 32:10.948
What's even less?

32:11.809 --> 32:12.730
Even closer!

32:13.751 --> 32:15.233
Shiori's debut!

32:15.253 --> 32:17.696
That's tonight, Ruffians!

32:18.116 --> 32:21.259
It's not even 24 hours away, that's tonight!

32:21.800 --> 32:23.081
Is it 12 hours away?

32:23.302 --> 32:24.343
I don't even know anymore.

32:29.438 --> 32:32.320
Ruffians, are you hyped?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.101
Are you excited?

32:33.121 --> 32:36.503
I am discombobulated.

32:36.523 --> 32:39.986
It's 11 hours from now.

32:43.164 --> 32:46.106
Okay, it's not even 12!

32:47.947 --> 32:48.607
Oh my gosh.

32:49.407 --> 32:50.468
I don't know, Ruffians.

32:50.508 --> 32:55.370
Let's get ready to see Shiori in her fully 3D body!

32:56.111 --> 32:58.732
And see her being all silly, being all squally.

32:58.872 --> 32:59.713
There, there.

33:00.493 --> 33:03.614
Whatever other silly Shiori things she says, I don't like it either.

33:03.654 --> 33:04.915
There'll be lots of them!

33:04.935 --> 33:06.996
What time is that at?

33:07.136 --> 33:10.377
It's at 8pm PT!

33:10.657 --> 33:13.119
Or 12pm JST.

33:13.139 --> 33:17.921
Make sure you get lots of snacks!

33:18.001 --> 33:24.824
Shiori's favorite snacks... Shiori's really liked plonder rings recently.

33:24.844 --> 33:29.706
Shiori, FUWAMOCO, can we get plonder rings?

33:31.537 --> 33:32.718
Yes, Shiori, we can.

33:32.838 --> 33:33.819
Yes, yes, yes!

33:34.859 --> 33:36.320
It's at 8pm PT.

33:36.481 --> 33:42.465
I don't think we can get even more hyped than that.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.306
No.

33:45.387 --> 33:46.608
It's gonna be busy.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.689
Please get ready, Ruffians!

33:49.070 --> 33:52.072
Let's all cheer on Shiori, okay?

33:53.613 --> 33:53.913
Okay!

33:54.353 --> 33:55.374
BAU BAU!

33:55.414 --> 33:57.175
I'm so, so excited.

33:57.255 --> 33:58.176
I can't even believe it.

33:58.516 --> 33:59.357
It's 4am for you.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.458
I know it's tough, but...

34:02.258 --> 34:03.719
3D debut though.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.561
It only happened once.

34:06.601 --> 34:08.162
3D debut only happens once.

34:08.263 --> 34:12.706
Ruffians, Yuzu will never tell you to stay up the crazy hours.

34:13.426 --> 34:17.189
But I think 3D debuts.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.231
I think it's worth it.

34:20.391 --> 34:24.414
I told somebody we very deeply love Shiori!

34:24.975 --> 34:26.095
Biboo!

34:26.236 --> 34:27.797
It's a special special event.

34:31.069 --> 34:31.409
BAU BAU!

34:31.549 --> 34:41.896
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today.

34:41.916 --> 34:46.939
I feel like I need to see a doggy.

34:47.220 --> 34:49.141
And this is the Doggie of the Day.

34:49.161 --> 34:50.382
We have... De-den!

34:54.748 --> 34:58.150
Bomi's a Doggie of the Day!

34:58.610 --> 35:03.033
Bomi's a bundle of... I'm not feeling great though.

35:04.365 --> 35:06.867
Get better soon, Bomi!

35:07.407 --> 35:08.307
Get better!

35:08.688 --> 35:11.729
I'm sure you know Bomi will be back to BAU BAUing.

35:11.889 --> 35:15.191
I always feel better after being all bundled up.

35:15.211 --> 35:17.533
Bundled up getting sick of these.

35:17.553 --> 35:20.214
Then you'll be all ready to go again.

35:20.254 --> 35:23.256
Bomi looks so nice and fluffy there, too.

35:23.776 --> 35:25.337
Good eyebrows, huh?

35:26.578 --> 35:27.978
Ten out of ten, dog!

35:27.998 --> 35:29.860
Actually, you're mistaken.

35:31.140 --> 35:31.861
Better than that.

35:32.481 --> 35:33.502
A thousand out of ten.

35:34.812 --> 35:36.554
BAU BAU!

35:36.614 --> 35:39.178
Moco-chan, how does Bomi BAU BAU?

35:39.198 --> 35:45.646
I think Bomi is probably feeling a little bit down, so maybe like... BAU BAU.

35:45.926 --> 35:46.587
Very quiet.

35:47.128 --> 35:49.711
Soon, Bomi will be like BAU BAU!

35:49.771 --> 35:50.492
BAU BAU!

35:52.429 --> 35:56.572
I'm looking forward to hearing that BOOMY BAU BAU!

35:56.952 --> 35:57.473
BOOMY!

35:57.533 --> 36:01.135
BOOMY is just such a sweet and jolly little purr-purr!

36:01.635 --> 36:05.138
And we hope you'll be back to full BOOMY level soon!

36:05.158 --> 36:06.058
BOOMY STRENGTH!

36:06.158 --> 36:06.839
Yeah!

36:06.919 --> 36:11.202
We hope you can run around outside in the spring cleaning this summer time here!

36:11.262 --> 36:12.563
Why do you feel so good?

36:13.706 --> 36:15.889
Then, well, you may mistake.

36:16.269 --> 36:19.253
You'll be a fully soggy doggy now.

36:19.273 --> 36:19.573
BAU BAU!

36:19.593 --> 36:23.317
See you very soon!

36:23.357 --> 36:27.923
Well, thanks for our Today I Went On A Walk!

36:28.383 --> 36:29.585
We have... De-den!

36:33.103 --> 36:34.864
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

36:51.330 --> 36:53.051
But, uh, the bees!

36:53.131 --> 36:53.611
The bees!

36:53.691 --> 36:58.692
I'm sure the bees are a little scary, but they're probably just doing a very important job, right?

36:58.732 --> 37:00.472
Yeah, they're just buzz-buzzing around, huh?

37:00.492 --> 37:01.152
Yeah, buzz-buzz.

37:01.432 --> 37:01.972
Buzz-buzz.

37:02.273 --> 37:03.793
They get close to you, just go BAU BAU!

37:03.833 --> 37:04.473
BAU BAU!

37:04.813 --> 37:05.433
That's it.

37:05.653 --> 37:05.933
Yeah.

37:05.953 --> 37:11.995
Yeah, but good job for you getting out there to enjoy the lushness around the summer nature!

37:12.055 --> 37:12.535
Yeah!

37:12.575 --> 37:13.515
And weather!

37:13.535 --> 37:15.135
And hopefully you had sunscreen on!

37:15.155 --> 37:15.335
Yeah.

37:15.916 --> 37:17.236
So do it next time for sure.

37:17.256 --> 37:17.896
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.505
BAU BAU!

37:21.545 --> 37:22.245
Bees are cute.

37:22.265 --> 37:22.745
They are!

37:22.785 --> 37:23.265
They are!

37:23.285 --> 37:24.166
They're fuzzy, right?

37:24.186 --> 37:26.807
They're fuzzy, but then they get a bit cold sometimes.

37:26.867 --> 37:27.968
Yeah, and then they're like, ahh.

37:27.988 --> 37:29.429
That's when you have to BAU BAU.

37:29.449 --> 37:30.369
BAU BAU, run away.

37:30.829 --> 37:31.290
But yeah.

37:31.530 --> 37:35.272
But next, we have our Question of the Day!

37:35.392 --> 37:36.552
Let's take a look.

37:36.892 --> 37:38.653
De-den!

37:39.194 --> 37:41.395
Does Mococo like Mango-chan?

37:41.735 --> 37:46.337
Both the nicknames and the condiments.

37:46.777 --> 37:47.418
Mangoes!

37:49.694 --> 37:50.574
Mangoes are yummy!

37:50.674 --> 37:51.755
I like mangoes!

37:51.775 --> 37:54.216
It wasn't asked of me, but I like mangoes!

37:54.256 --> 37:55.856
What about mango-chan, Moco-chan?

37:56.676 --> 37:58.277
They yummy.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.397
But fresh mangoes are better, right?

38:00.417 --> 38:01.778
I like mangoes.

38:02.578 --> 38:08.900
But Ruffians... You know, I'm Mococo, right?

38:10.821 --> 38:15.342
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

38:16.423 --> 38:18.883
Mococo or Moco-chan is okay.

38:18.903 --> 38:22.945
But I want people to know my name properly, okay?

38:26.546 --> 38:27.706
If you change it too much...

38:29.100 --> 38:31.241
It's not recognizable, you know?

38:31.281 --> 38:32.802
That makes me a little bit sad.

38:33.623 --> 38:34.143
Understood.

38:34.163 --> 38:35.224
Got it.

38:35.304 --> 38:35.424
Okay.

38:36.004 --> 38:36.505
I'm Mococo!

38:36.565 --> 38:36.825
BAU BAU!

38:37.285 --> 38:37.425
Okay.

38:37.445 --> 38:38.906
What's the spell, Moco-chan?

38:38.946 --> 38:40.067
What is the spell?

38:40.087 --> 38:40.767
Mococo!

38:40.787 --> 38:41.128
BAU BAU!

38:53.015 --> 38:53.456
BAU BAU!

38:54.156 --> 38:56.898
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

38:57.178 --> 38:59.599
Please, we're always looking for your submissions.

38:59.639 --> 39:01.580
We're looking closely.

39:02.121 --> 39:05.943
Please send us your doggy of the days, your walks.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.905
I know you're seeing beautiful things outside.

39:09.405 --> 39:12.468
Please take a photo for us to see too, okay?

39:12.488 --> 39:19.214
Your questions and your Pero Sightings, we haven't seen Pero recently, so please let us know.

39:19.954 --> 39:21.896
BAU BAU!

39:21.936 --> 39:25.959
Don't forget the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

39:26.200 --> 39:27.321
BAU BAU!

39:27.341 --> 39:31.544
For our next stream coming up, we have De-den!

39:32.665 --> 39:34.847
It's Super Chat Week!

39:35.027 --> 39:37.890
Thank you, Ruffians, for being here!

39:38.150 --> 39:47.477
We're gonna read a bunch of your Super Chats and chat all about, you know, our recent feelings with our song release and our future anniversary and lots of stuff!

39:47.497 --> 39:48.918
3D coming up!

39:48.959 --> 39:51.621
So we hope you'll be there for a comfy time.

39:51.661 --> 39:54.243
Just you be there, okay?

39:54.303 --> 39:55.244
And then after that,

39:55.824 --> 40:00.765
Wow, if you look at our schedule, Moco-chan, there's something big right after that!

40:00.846 --> 40:01.266
Right after!

40:01.286 --> 40:02.846
Shiori's 3D debut!

40:02.946 --> 40:04.227
Yeah!

40:04.367 --> 40:05.387
Mama!

40:05.427 --> 40:14.229
We can't wait, so make sure you get nice and cozy for the super chat meeting, and then get ready for something else in Shiori's 3D debut!

40:14.329 --> 40:16.010
That's what she has for us, huh?

40:16.390 --> 40:22.152
But, don't forget the next day at the same time, Biboo's 3D debut is happening too, so...

40:23.332 --> 40:27.253
Let's have a bunch of excitement!

40:27.313 --> 40:29.553
BAU BAU!

40:29.613 --> 40:35.974
And for Ruffians who are joining us today through the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO Morning!

40:36.794 --> 40:38.235
It's BAU BAU!

40:38.315 --> 40:40.155
Shiori, Biboo, Didi!

40:40.575 --> 40:42.955

40:43.336 --> 40:50.717
Thank you so so much Ruffians for joining us today and this week for FUWAMOCO Morning!

It's time that we see you again for the next FUWAMOCO Morning!

40:56.765 --> 41:01.634
Shiori and Biboo will both have made their CD debut!

41:01.674 --> 41:02.615
That's crazy!

41:04.840 --> 41:11.704
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
