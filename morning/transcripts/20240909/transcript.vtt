00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:18.419
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.663
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.366
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:29.688
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.062 --> 00:05:39.366
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:41.368
It's a Monday!

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.169
Wake up!

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.870
Wake up!

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.251
Wake up!

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:46.953
Thank you for waking up.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.657
And joining us today for our 124th episode, BAU BAU!

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:58.214
How are you doing?

00:05:58.234 --> 00:05:59.356
Is that bad?

00:05:59.597 --> 00:06:00.578
I see that.

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:01.480
You are awake!

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.664
Let me just fluff that on out.

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:04.886
Sleepy.

00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:08.554
It's okay!

00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:08.854
No!

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:12.116
FUWAMOCO Morning is now, no more 5 more minutes!

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.478
BAU BAU!

00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:25.083
Well, for those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:25.884

00:06:25.944 --> 00:06:26.844
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:27.905
Hosted by us,

00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:29.046

Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:50.226
BAU BAU!

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.209
Ruffians, do you have it memorized yet?

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:58.170
Are you awake?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.811
You have breakfast!

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:04.613
Don't eat the hashtags for breakfast, okay?

00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:07.474
They look like cereal, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:09.615
Hashtag cereal.

00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:13.057
Hashtag breakfast cereal idea.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.320
What?!

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:19.945
It's gonna be extra trendy, Moco-chan!

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.887
Don't need to aim it, name it, name it anything!

00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:24.428
Just you know, on the box.

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:25.149
It's trendy.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.532
At HelloVenica, hashtag trending.

00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:43.237
Good twins in class.

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:45.598
BAU BAU!

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.220
There's more disappointing stuff for today.

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.482
What is it?

00:07:50.522 --> 00:07:53.164
The LT thing.

00:07:53.224 --> 00:07:54.325
Yeah.

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:58.087
Well... Obvious.

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:01.469
You know.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.970
What?

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.911
What?

00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:04.792
There's been another...

00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:06.855
Pero Sighting.

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:09.116
BAU BAU!

00:08:09.997 --> 00:08:12.858
Moco-chan, where was he seen this time?

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.780
Well, let's take a look.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.481
De-den!

00:08:18.242 --> 00:08:19.123
BAU BAU!

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:20.964
That's beautiful.

00:08:22.604 --> 00:08:25.585
Nasty but beautiful!

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:27.145
A beautiful cloud!

00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:29.506
Was it just about to get stormy there?

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:32.667
You know, sometimes it sort of gets like that.

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:38.869
Yeah, before it got stormy, you know, it started with a nice weather, then it just turned into a horrible rain.

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:42.710
Hopefully it got blown away really fast, you know.

00:08:45.444 --> 00:08:46.905
Get in the way of your plans.

00:09:03.446 --> 00:09:04.687
Yeah.

00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:05.488
All your words.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.032
BAU BAU!

00:09:09.052 --> 00:09:09.392
BAU BAU!

00:09:09.412 --> 00:09:11.194
Sometimes Pero can do that, huh?

00:09:11.514 --> 00:09:12.795
Get in the way of your words!

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:13.676
Yeah.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.418
BAU BAU.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:17.120
BAU BAU!

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.381
BAU!

00:09:18.401 --> 00:09:20.763
Oh, it's some good news!

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:22.025
Ruffians!

00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:35.273
While our lovely demon of sound of hololive English -Advent-, Nerissa Ravencroft just released an MV for her original song, In My Feelings!

00:09:35.353 --> 00:09:36.316
Yeah!

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:36.937
BAU BAU!

00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:39.463
Congrats, Nerissa!

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:45.698
In My Feelings is extra special because it is the title track of Nerissa's EP that she released at the---

00:09:46.202 --> 00:09:47.083
At the beginning of August!

00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:48.384
You might have already heard it!

00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:49.184
What?

00:09:49.624 --> 00:09:51.626
This is the perfect chance to go listen again!

00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:51.946
Yeah!

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:56.188
Now we have a beautiful music video!

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:58.710
The video is something else!

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.171
It uses, you know, 3D.

00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.092
3D like real life!

00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:06.135
But you know, it just makes a better chance to really focus in on the lyrics.

00:10:06.275 --> 00:10:06.435
Yeah!

00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:09.757
To have a lot of feelings that Nerissa wrote herself!

00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:11.298
Nerissa wrote herself!

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:15.701
You know, maybe it was written towards

00:10:18.053 --> 00:10:18.533
I don't know.

00:10:19.254 --> 00:10:20.675
Jailbreak?

00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:22.597
Kind of a sad song though, Nerissa.

00:10:22.677 --> 00:10:24.279
It's so sad though.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.701
You have to take a look and think about it!

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:28.903
Yeah, take a listen too.

00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.492
And then, think about your feelings.

00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:37.934
And then maybe you'll be in your feelings together with Nerissa-chan.

00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.755
What's the art?

00:10:39.855 --> 00:10:43.738
The art of the video is done by the wonderful Yomousaka-sensei!

00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:49.621
Please take a look, there's some very cute illustrations of Nerissa.

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:51.982
She has a cute outfit, you know?

00:10:52.002 --> 00:10:54.883
Blue white shirt and black skirt.

00:10:54.963 --> 00:10:57.405
And you can see her wings so nicely!

00:10:58.365 --> 00:11:00.587
Fuzzy Wings.

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:04.731
Let's go take a whistle, okay?

00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:07.774
You know, supporting original music.

00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:08.435
Advent.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.777
All the music releases, you know.

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:12.719
Releasing original music.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.501
It's very difficult.

00:11:15.561 --> 00:11:16.923
It's not a given, okay?

00:11:17.063 --> 00:11:19.145
And we put so much of ourselves into it.

00:11:19.165 --> 00:11:20.226
It's very personal.

00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:22.869
So please go have a listen, okay?

00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:24.290
You always do.

00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:30.777
BAU BAU, thank you!

00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:33.580
Speaking of original music...

00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:36.642
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.404
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:11:53.474 --> 00:11:56.776
Welcome to the anime Isekai Suicide Squad!

00:11:56.796 --> 00:12:01.298
And you know, this music video, it's fully animated by Rit Studio!

00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:01.758
Yeah!

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:03.139
Just like the anime!

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:03.860
It's amazing!

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.320
Look at Calli-senpai!

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.500
Yes!

00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:06.621
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:09.303
You know they're perfectly positioned here.

00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:12.344
Harley Quinn or Calli-senpai.

00:12:12.424 --> 00:12:13.525
Who is the waifu?

00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:16.922
You couldn't make me say that.

00:12:16.942 --> 00:12:20.143
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:12:20.183 --> 00:12:21.924
Who's the waifu?

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:22.504
Huh?

00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:23.624
Huh?

00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:26.025
Huh?

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:28.466
Oof!

00:12:29.146 --> 00:12:29.626
Oof!

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.807
Hi!

00:12:31.427 --> 00:12:33.928
I have oof for singing the morning!

00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:36.528
Calli, it's the dog!

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.109
That is true, but dog could be a waifu too!

00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:41.810
Can dog be a waifu?

00:12:48.609 --> 00:12:52.853
I don't see many answers.

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:55.095
Ruffians, you're not gonna help out Moco-chan!

00:12:55.115 --> 00:12:58.077
I think YouTube is so many answers!

00:12:58.718 --> 00:12:59.739
Cali is the Hialeah!

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:00.799
That's the answer!

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:02.641
Cali is the Hialeah!

00:13:02.661 --> 00:13:02.821
Yes!

00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:07.144
BAU BAU!

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:18.008
But in this music video, you can see both Harley Quinn and Calliope by dancing together in two different universes.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:22.430
I think wild things would happen if the worlds accidentally collided.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.131
It's probably best like that!

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:30.395
Ruffians, the video is so amazing!

00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:37.421
That even just after a few hours, it's already at over 1 million views!

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.583
1 million!

00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:44.588
Congratulations, everyone!

00:13:44.628 --> 00:13:47.130
That's so so happy for me!

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.232
That's amazing!

00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:50.193
Go getters!

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:52.255
Go getting the million viewers!

00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:56.356
Yeah, we're so happy for her!

00:13:56.396 --> 00:14:07.719
Yeah, you know, I'm sure it's so many hololive members' dream to sing an anime song and I can't cheer for Kelly-san, but it is such an amazing song and amazing music video too.

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:08.059
Right?

00:14:08.099 --> 00:14:14.561
Yeah, she has a music video where she's moving together almost in the same world all together with everyone.

00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:15.281
Yeah, anime girl!

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:19.786
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.883
Do listen, do not listen!

00:14:40.243 --> 00:14:41.725
Which one is it, Moco-chan?

00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:42.105
Do listen!

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.948
Make sure you do listen!

00:14:45.128 --> 00:14:46.309
Dad or waifu?

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.510
Which one, Moco-chan?

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.492
Listen, don't listen!

00:14:49.853 --> 00:14:50.714
No more oof!

00:14:51.174 --> 00:14:52.235
No more oof!

00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:53.056
No more oof!

00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:55.178
Go listen, okay?

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:56.679
Go listen.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.680
Go get the listen.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.994
BAU BAU!

00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:05.357
I'm not waking up, okay Ruffians?

00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:06.078
I'm not.

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:07.179
Yeah.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.541
Got it?

00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:08.821
No.

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:10.823
You're the one who's waking up.

00:15:11.204 --> 00:15:12.005
Good morning!

00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:12.806
Waking up?

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:13.166
Waking up.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.390
BAU BAU!

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.831
I hope you like music, Ruffians!

00:15:21.112 --> 00:15:23.033
Because!

00:15:23.153 --> 00:15:28.155
You know we talked about Nerissa, I generally talked about Kai-senpai and Senpai.

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:30.716
Next, we get to talk about our kohai, Lauda!

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:40.600
hololive English -Justice- just released their second cover song!

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.500
BAU BAU!

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.840
ECHO!

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.961
It's a Vocaloid Goonies song!

00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:46.661
It's a classic!

00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:47.502
Did you listen?

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:50.202
It's just came out fresh!

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:57.145
Iyana did such an amazing job!

00:15:57.325 --> 00:16:00.467
You might have to thank someone special.

00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:07.770
Iyana didn't just do the singing, she also did the art too!

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.410
Too amazing!

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.371
She's too talented!

00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:11.731
Right!

00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:24.989
That means, Ruffians, that means you need to go and give our Koukai's brand new cover song a good listen, okay?

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:28.992
She worked so hard on it!

00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.293
I'm just so proud of her!

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:33.014
Koukai's down!

00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:34.115
BAU BAU!

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:37.678
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:42.201
Should we release a cover song with us doing the illustrations?

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.533
What song would that be, Moco-chan?

00:16:47.553 --> 00:16:49.474
I don't know.

00:16:49.554 --> 00:16:55.976
Kaeru no uta ga kikoete kuru yo.

00:16:56.437 --> 00:16:56.757
BAU!

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:57.557

00:16:58.057 --> 00:16:58.377

00:16:58.878 --> 00:16:59.218
BAU!

00:16:59.658 --> 00:17:00.878
Your frog is a good baller.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:02.119
Yes.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.060
Bye bye!

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.441
Bye bye!

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.141
You watch it.

00:17:09.402 --> 00:17:11.262
I think I could draw a picture of a frog.

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:12.443
I think.

00:17:13.797 --> 00:17:16.580
That's a lot of confidence you got there.

00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:19.803
BAU BAU!

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.165
BAU NEXT, RuffianS!

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:23.506
It's the time!

00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:25.829
We're all excited!

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:28.131
The regular quarter!

00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:30.313
Do you know what quarter that is, Ruffians?

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:32.335
Do you know what the new regular quarter is?

00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:34.497
New regular quarter?

00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:39.177
The Mondays used to be, you know, challenge yourself.

00:17:39.197 --> 00:17:39.797
They used to be that.

00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:41.178
Misunderstanding.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.220
No, it's a new regular corner, Ruffians.

00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:45.441
Yes!

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:50.425
The new FUWAMOCO merch corner!

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.606
BAU BAU!

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:56.509
BAU BAU!

00:17:56.749 --> 00:18:00.412
Ruffians, you are feeling a little tired, aren't you?

00:18:00.592 --> 00:18:01.713
Maybe just a bit.

00:18:02.213 --> 00:18:03.734
Tired!

00:18:04.014 --> 00:18:04.214
Yeah.

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:04.835
We get it.

00:18:04.855 --> 00:18:05.355
We get it.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.583
Just in case you wanted to know!

00:18:09.603 --> 00:18:14.367
You know we covered last time, you know we have a 3-day showcase celebration, right?

00:18:14.387 --> 00:18:18.490
You know, it's also a live record, so we talked about it quickly.

00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:23.515
But, now, there is new FUWAMOCO merch!

00:18:24.095 --> 00:18:24.976
Yeah!

00:18:25.316 --> 00:18:26.757
Right now, Ruffians!

00:18:27.057 --> 00:18:28.257
Let's take a look at it!

00:18:29.018 --> 00:18:29.998
Right now!

00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:33.020
It's hololive's 7th anniversary!

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:40.004
And here at FUWAMOCO, we're here all together in our special party performance to celebrate!

00:18:40.024 --> 00:18:40.504
Yes!

00:18:40.684 --> 00:18:41.465
Yeah!

00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:47.768
And you can find us all together with everybody at anime store locations all across Japan!

00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:50.790
But you know, there are actually special displays!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.711
One-size-for-Moco panels,

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:58.354
So that you can find the Ikebukuro anime on the 7th floor for the 7th anniversary.

00:18:58.474 --> 00:18:59.835
I'm sure they planned that.

00:18:59.915 --> 00:19:04.118
I'm sure, I'm sure.

00:19:04.198 --> 00:19:09.101
So if you have the time, please go take a photo with us, okay?

00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:10.662
They're party girls, aren't they?

00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:11.322
Wedding dresses.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.163
Party, party.

00:19:12.223 --> 00:19:13.384
It's like a wedding dress.

00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:29.650
During the 7th Anniversary Special, you can get Merchandise Account Badges, Acrylic Stamps, Keychains, Lucky 5 Accords, and much much more!

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:36.092
So if you want to get your paws on them, please head over to animeokawawuffins!

00:19:36.952 --> 00:19:37.273
Yes.

00:19:37.773 --> 00:19:37.913
And.

00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:38.574
But.

00:19:39.255 --> 00:19:39.355
Uh.

00:19:40.116 --> 00:19:41.458
It doesn't just stop there!

00:19:41.478 --> 00:19:42.640
It doesn't stop there!

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:50.270
Also brand new, newly available on the official hololive shop, we have fan name keychains!

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.832
Ruffian keychains!

00:19:52.052 --> 00:19:53.072
Yes, more!

00:19:53.132 --> 00:19:57.854
Yeah, you can now grind yourself as a Ruffian wherever you go!

00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:01.276
Yeah, wherever you go you're a Ruffian.

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:04.297
But now this keychain will remind you just in case.

00:20:04.317 --> 00:20:05.597
Just in case you forget!

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:08.338
Yeah, and it reminds just like our logo!

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:12.020
And I think it will look great on any itabag too!

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.461
Okay, Ruffians.

00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:18.328
There's a lot of words.

00:20:18.528 --> 00:20:19.429
A lot of words!

00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:20.491
We understand.

00:20:21.252 --> 00:20:21.573
Yeah.

00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:23.115
We're surprised too, right?

00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:24.016
Yeah.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:25.979
It isn't a bit much right now.

00:20:28.115 --> 00:20:31.397
We won't let you forget, okay?

00:20:31.537 --> 00:20:35.880
If there's really, really, really something exciting

00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:58.494
Yeah, priority list.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:03.958
The thing is, I feel like there's too much for a priority list.

00:21:03.978 --> 00:21:06.880
There's a lot Ruffians.

00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:09.302
Yeah, but Ruffians!

00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:19.362
Please remember, you know, you choose what you think you're most excited for and what you want to put into your collection, okay?

00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:24.985
No, no, no, please make sure that you do not break the bank, okay?

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:29.168
We really don't want you to feel stressed or anything like that, you know?

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:32.590
We understand that it's been a lot recently, okay?

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.951
This is supposed to be fun!

00:21:35.031 --> 00:21:36.652
You need to eat!

00:21:36.672 --> 00:21:37.813
You need to eat!

00:21:38.513 --> 00:21:44.517
It's supposed to be fun!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.378
Okay!

00:21:45.918 --> 00:21:46.538
Okay!

00:21:47.219 --> 00:21:48.499
Ruffians!

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.060
We understand.

00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:51.902
We know what you're feeling.

00:21:51.922 --> 00:21:52.982
Okay.

00:21:53.322 --> 00:21:54.023
Food sandwich!

00:21:54.203 --> 00:21:55.924
Eat the food, Ruffians!

00:21:56.604 --> 00:21:57.605
Eat the food!

00:21:57.685 --> 00:21:59.566
Yeah, okay.

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:00.667
We understand.

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:10.066
We don't want you to be stressed, that's not what we want at all, okay?

00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:11.368
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:11.428 --> 00:22:15.211
We both have four letters, but... Both are important.

00:22:15.291 --> 00:22:15.551
BAU BAU!

00:22:15.571 --> 00:22:16.432
Can you eat acrylic?

00:22:16.572 --> 00:22:16.973
Uh, no.

00:22:17.453 --> 00:22:19.635
There's no nutrients in acrylic, okay?

00:22:20.056 --> 00:22:20.756
Remember that.

00:22:21.357 --> 00:22:21.657
Food.

00:22:22.077 --> 00:22:22.618
Acrylics.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.592
One has nutrients, one does not now.

00:22:25.832 --> 00:22:26.172
Okay?

00:22:27.073 --> 00:22:29.655
BAU BAU!

00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:33.818
Just know that we understand, okay Ruffians?

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:35.560
It's a crazy pace.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.961
BAU BAU!

00:22:37.843 --> 00:22:39.944
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.815
Bye bye!

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:21.401
You know, just like fan art, it's kind of another way that we can all have fun together and make something amazing!

00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:29.347
But one thing we noticed is that for FUWAMOCO, assets are pretty rare for some reason.

00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:33.774
But we like to use them if you like to make them fun.

00:23:33.794 --> 00:23:34.934
Okay, Ruffians?

00:23:35.274 --> 00:23:40.255
I'm not sure if you remember, there's a lot of Ruffians over there for our debut.

00:23:40.455 --> 00:23:48.037
But our hashtag #helpFWMC, is actually made just for these two, you know?

00:23:48.137 --> 00:23:52.398
You know the hashtag is for anything you think that could help us, including us.

00:23:52.578 --> 00:23:58.079
Yeah, you know, like, oh this could be helpful, oh this could be interesting, oh whatever.

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:00.420
Do we have anything in mind?

00:24:29.455 --> 00:24:32.056
I wanna see lots of Ruffians thinking we'll be fun.

00:24:32.376 --> 00:24:34.957
What do you think would be fun?

00:24:35.737 --> 00:24:35.897
Okay.

00:24:36.317 --> 00:24:38.637
Sometimes there's technical limitations.

00:24:38.657 --> 00:24:40.278
But it should be okay.

00:24:40.298 --> 00:24:40.678
BAU BAU!

00:24:40.718 --> 00:24:40.958
Ruffians!

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.513
You really wanna see a swimsuit on top of a jacket?

00:24:54.573 --> 00:24:55.053
On top of a jacket?

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:55.874
On top of a jacket!

00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:57.275
Kinda doesn't really work, huh?

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:57.635
Yeah?

00:24:57.675 --> 00:24:57.775
Yes!

00:25:09.011 --> 00:25:09.212
Yes!

00:25:11.354 --> 00:25:11.995
Hi!

00:25:12.616 --> 00:25:14.158
I don't know about the Ruffians.

00:25:14.218 --> 00:25:15.660
Ruffians are silly, huh?

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.101
Something never change.

00:25:17.502 --> 00:25:17.963
Yeah.

00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:20.225
BAU BAU!

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.929
We are Ruffians!

00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:24.391
FUWAMOCO!

00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:25.071
It's Monday!

00:25:26.453 --> 00:25:32.617
And, you know, we've been go go go going all day long.

00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:34.258
It's been a super busy day.

00:25:34.318 --> 00:25:36.579
We've been very good puppies.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.501
We've been so much.

00:25:38.821 --> 00:25:41.723
Hard at work all day.

00:25:41.863 --> 00:25:43.303
All day long.

00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:46.846
You know, even Mine and Channel have proud of us for being such role models.

00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:48.106
Yes, yes.

00:25:49.527 --> 00:25:52.769
And so you know, Ruffians, now here we are!

00:25:53.129 --> 00:26:01.454
Here to give you a big high five and pass that hardworking baton to you so that you can do your best today, okay?

00:26:01.574 --> 00:26:03.615
You can do your absolute best!

00:26:03.675 --> 00:26:05.436
You can get all those things done, okay?

00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:06.497
This is not a pup talk.

00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:08.838
But the day's just started, you know?

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:10.399
Give it your all, okay?

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.222
You can do it!

00:26:13.362 --> 00:26:16.489
All the possibilities, they're all within you!

00:26:16.609 --> 00:26:18.052
And you know, we know it's Monday.

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:19.495
It's Ruffians.

00:26:20.923 --> 00:26:23.204
But we know, Ruffians, you can do it!

00:26:23.264 --> 00:26:24.944
You'll make us proud, okay?

00:26:24.984 --> 00:26:26.644
Here you are!

00:26:26.844 --> 00:26:28.245
Big high five!

00:26:28.725 --> 00:26:30.485
BAU BAU!

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:32.446
Do your best, okay?

00:26:32.606 --> 00:26:36.187
BAU BAU!

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.307
You can do it!

00:26:37.327 --> 00:26:38.827
You motivated!

00:26:39.607 --> 00:26:41.268
Your morning hasn't been very good?

00:26:41.648 --> 00:26:41.908
Wow.

00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:44.209
Here is the high five.

00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:45.550
So that is gonna be better, okay?

00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:47.952
It's gonna be better, okay, Ruffians?

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:51.876
We blew the nasty Pero clouds out of the sky.

00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.897
Yeah, I'm too soft.

00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:55.519
It's still way down on our mouth.

00:26:56.199 --> 00:26:57.500
BAU BAU!

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.822
BAU BAU!

00:26:59.862 --> 00:27:04.026
Let's take a look at some of our regular corners that aren't the merch corner.

00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:06.348
It's not a corner, Ruffians.

00:27:06.748 --> 00:27:08.209
It's not a corner, we're not joking.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.754
Let's take a look at what the Doggie of the Day is today!

00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:22.601
Today... Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:27.845
This is our Doggie of the Day!

00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:30.226
I like this dog.

00:27:30.427 --> 00:27:30.567
But...

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.514
He has no name!

00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:35.698
Yeah!

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.364
Ruffians!

00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:39.171
We give him a name!

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:39.492
Huh?

00:27:43.452 --> 00:27:45.013
I just saw Maya and his doggy.

00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:46.355
Very fluffy doggy.

00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:47.956
Very beautiful eyes.

00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:49.617
Yeah, those blue eyes.

00:27:49.678 --> 00:27:50.398
Yeah!

00:27:50.498 --> 00:27:52.880
Sort of like a certain someone, huh?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.161
Fluffy!

00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:53.681
Yeah!

00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:57.544
I feel like I have some white friends.

00:27:57.564 --> 00:27:59.446
This is a doggy I didn't know!

00:27:59.566 --> 00:28:00.107
Marvin!

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:00.747
Marvin!

00:28:00.807 --> 00:28:01.027
Marvin!

00:28:01.047 --> 00:28:01.508
I like that.

00:28:02.128 --> 00:28:02.609
Marvin!

00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:03.209
Marvin!

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.790
Marvin!

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.270
Marvin!

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.612
Today's Doggie of the Day is Marvin!

00:28:08.013 --> 00:28:09.854
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:34.038 --> 00:28:35.218
That's a Marvin.

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:38.280
Marvin kind of sounds like a koto, no?

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.900
A koto?

00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:41.721
A koto, right?

00:28:42.462 --> 00:28:47.344
Is that what a koto sounds like?

00:28:47.884 --> 00:28:54.127
A koto is a Japanese instrument.

00:28:54.347 --> 00:28:56.348
Marvin's kind of silly, huh?

00:28:57.745 --> 00:29:01.747
That's a unique doggy.

00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:13.673
Well, you know, Marvin is the Doggie of the Day that I like to just look at really nice and close to and just stick my head into all that fluff.

00:29:13.873 --> 00:29:16.355
It sure looks like there's enough of it for both of us.

00:29:17.635 --> 00:29:22.378
I think we can all agree this is a very good looking doggy.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.433
Maybe even yummy too.

00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.475
Maybe a bit.

00:29:29.155 --> 00:29:31.057
BAU BAU!

00:29:31.157 --> 00:29:32.659
Thank you, Moribun!

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:34.141
BAU BAU!

00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:36.183
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:29:36.223 --> 00:29:37.144
What kind of go on a walk?

00:29:37.204 --> 00:29:38.565
Where did we go, Ruffians?

00:29:38.585 --> 00:29:39.907
We have de-den!

00:29:40.147 --> 00:29:41.388
Beautiful!

00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:47.577
It's a house hidden in plants.

00:29:47.757 --> 00:29:49.398
I love houses like this!

00:29:49.498 --> 00:29:54.659
You know, sometimes in the Northwest, passagees come across them, too!

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:00.300
Don't you always wonder what it'd be like living in there?

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.481
I wanna be behind the window and just covering all the plants!

00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:08.222
Yeah, I feel like it'd almost be like you're being protected by them, right?

00:30:08.302 --> 00:30:09.282
Like a big hug!

00:30:09.602 --> 00:30:12.443
Yeah, it'd be kind of magical, wouldn't it?

00:30:12.463 --> 00:30:12.763
Allergies?

00:30:12.783 --> 00:30:13.563
Allergies!

00:30:13.963 --> 00:30:16.510
If you have allergies, that's not the place to be, huh?

00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:17.633
Is this Fauna Mart?

00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:17.934
Wow.

00:30:21.463 --> 00:30:22.686
We have life Fauna Mart.

00:30:23.638 --> 00:30:24.818
BAU BAU!

00:30:24.898 --> 00:30:28.659
Thank you for sharing this dumb show of your life with us!

00:30:28.879 --> 00:30:30.619
BAU BAU!

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:35.040
And next, we have our Question of the Day.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.660
We have De-den!

00:30:38.061 --> 00:30:41.381
I enjoyed the new extreme love voice part!

00:30:41.401 --> 00:30:42.141
Thank you!

00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:46.302
I was wondering how it was decided that you would both be on it.

00:30:46.622 --> 00:30:50.343
I've always thought of Moco-chan as more of a tsundere character.

00:30:50.543 --> 00:30:52.383
Maybe you need to check yourself, huh?

00:30:53.577 --> 00:30:54.618
I don't know.

00:30:55.278 --> 00:31:03.983
Ruffians, isn't everyone a little yandere sometimes?

00:31:04.144 --> 00:31:05.364
Moco-chan!

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:08.566
Moco-chan's pretty tsund tsund, actually.

00:31:09.407 --> 00:31:10.027
And me!

00:31:10.047 --> 00:31:12.489
I think I'm pretty dere dere, right?

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:20.158
I don't know, is it that interesting that we just kind of stayed the same?

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:23.621
Yeah, we have to be different, right?

00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:27.604
I was thinking that we could just become good at it.

00:31:27.644 --> 00:31:29.566
That's kind of hard though, you know.

00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:34.711
We just kind of get too excited when we're with you.

00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:35.992
We get too excited, huh?

00:31:36.372 --> 00:31:38.054
Do you want to play a game today?

00:31:38.722 --> 00:31:43.090
This sounds more frightening like a horror game.

00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:46.096
I'm here to protect your smile.

00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:49.221
I thought it was Yandere!

00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:50.402
No, it's not!

00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:52.522
That's my best clue, dere.

00:31:52.602 --> 00:31:57.363
Maybe it's... Maybe it's message of Yandere heart.

00:31:58.164 --> 00:31:59.244
Maybe.

00:32:00.204 --> 00:32:03.265
Yeah, I just wanted to give you an easier choice.

00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:04.725
BAU BAU!

00:32:05.386 --> 00:32:07.426
Maybe that's why.

00:32:07.486 --> 00:32:08.786
Well, there's your answer.

00:32:08.986 --> 00:32:09.407
Yeah.

00:32:09.887 --> 00:32:10.647
I'm Mofin.

00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:13.028
Better watch out, okay?

00:32:13.409 --> 00:32:16.291
Check out my new voice pack!

00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:19.213
And watch out because Halloween is approaching, too!

00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:20.854
It is approaching, huh?

00:32:21.074 --> 00:32:21.234
Yeah.

00:32:21.715 --> 00:32:22.415
Sooner than later!

00:32:22.475 --> 00:32:23.376
Sooner than later!

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:24.737
BAU BAU!

00:32:25.237 --> 00:32:29.600
And Ruffians, thank you so much for all your submissions!

00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:34.664
Please, you know, we love to have you part of this journey!

00:32:34.684 --> 00:32:36.765
Moco-chan, you're breaking the camera!

00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:39.047
It's just temporary pause.

00:32:41.189 --> 00:32:44.151
So, please send us your Doggie of the Day!

00:32:44.411 --> 00:32:48.073
You know, send us a little snapshot into your daily life, Ruffians!

00:32:48.113 --> 00:32:49.234
Show us your walks!

00:32:49.975 --> 00:32:51.956
Send us your questions!

00:32:52.476 --> 00:32:56.759
And if you happen to see Pero, send us the misfortune of the sighting.

00:32:56.779 --> 00:32:57.840
Okay?

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.222
Please let us know with the hashtag!

00:33:01.523 --> 00:33:02.123
Hashtag!

00:33:02.663 --> 00:33:05.025
FWMCMORNING!

00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:08.828
Ruffians, you know, we haven't forgotten about the hashtag.

00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:11.249
FWMCScoop2.

00:33:11.409 --> 00:33:19.552
You know, if you have any new interesting news, hololive hololive tips, please let us know, okay?

00:33:19.612 --> 00:33:21.113
BAU BAU!

00:33:21.313 --> 00:33:22.674
Thank you, Mofurians!

00:33:23.174 --> 00:33:28.036
And for our next stream, we have... De-den!

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:29.456
Donkey Kong 2!

00:33:29.496 --> 00:33:38.240
Today we're gonna take a little bit of a break from... Well... I have to... Oh my god.

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:41.152
A lot of work.

00:33:41.192 --> 00:33:42.533
Yeah.

00:33:42.713 --> 00:33:44.595
According to practice.

00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:48.257
But we might get a little bit of a rest.

00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:49.257
Yeah.

00:33:49.518 --> 00:33:49.858
Yeah.

00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:50.278
Yeah.

00:33:50.638 --> 00:33:53.220
Get our homework done so we can go to sleep early!

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:53.900
Yeah!

00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:54.881
Alright!

00:33:55.441 --> 00:33:58.603
And then we'll have even more fun playing Donkey Kong Country 2 together!

00:33:58.643 --> 00:33:58.803
Yes!

00:33:58.924 --> 00:34:00.104
Okay, we'll see!

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:00.845
Okay!

00:34:01.545 --> 00:34:03.586
Has this nest been able to get some sleep?

00:34:03.947 --> 00:34:04.127
No.

00:34:05.107 --> 00:34:05.908
Why didn't it?

00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:08.938
BAU BAU!

00:34:09.498 --> 00:34:10.479
BAU BAU!

00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:12.321
Let's take a peek at our schedule.

00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:13.682
Our schedule!

00:34:13.882 --> 00:34:14.082
Yes!

00:34:14.863 --> 00:34:18.466
Well, this week, you know, we're up to a bunch of different things.

00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:21.668
A lot of recreating, a lot of practice, a lot of stuff.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.834
But on Wednesday, we'll have FUWAMOCO Morning, so we'll be able to see you bright and early once more.

00:34:28.234 --> 00:34:33.078
And on Thursday, we're playing the brand new game from Hulu, Indie, Elite Exorcist

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:34.771
Yeah, I'm so excited!

00:34:34.811 --> 00:34:35.832
It looks really fun!

00:34:35.892 --> 00:34:36.273
Right?

00:34:36.293 --> 00:34:37.094
Really addicting!

00:34:37.134 --> 00:34:37.374
Yeah!

00:34:37.614 --> 00:34:39.317
Oh, it helps children!

00:34:39.397 --> 00:34:39.737
Yeah!

00:34:39.857 --> 00:34:42.420
We'll see just what it's like all together!

00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:46.486
Friday, we're back with FUWAMOCO Morning and some Super Chat meeting!

00:34:46.546 --> 00:34:48.027
Yeah, coffee time!

00:34:48.088 --> 00:34:51.612
Yeah, get nice and cozy and make some Super Chats, chat about this and that!

00:34:51.652 --> 00:34:53.114
Just be silly!

00:34:53.474 --> 00:34:54.395
And then Saturday!

00:34:54.796 --> 00:34:57.359
Well, it's time for us to warm up the barker!

00:34:57.379 --> 00:34:57.900
Yeah!

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.124
Because we're gonna be having a FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:01.604
Yeah!

00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:04.399
I do know summer's coming to a close.

00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:06.100
I feel like there's still a lot of summer.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.401
I feel like there's still a lot of energy.

00:35:09.421 --> 00:35:12.063
Let's hold out summer together, okay, love feelings?

00:35:12.423 --> 00:35:15.804
And then, Sunday, we're gonna go to the bathhouse.

00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:16.965
Our store bathhouse.

00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:18.666
B-bathhouse.

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:20.046
B-bathhouse.

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:20.967
B-bath.

00:35:21.387 --> 00:35:21.767
Yeah.

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:24.668
Maybe some BAU BAU here and there, too.

00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:25.069
Yeah.

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:25.909
Nice!

00:35:26.029 --> 00:35:26.689
Oh, and Zen!

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.370
Yeah.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.090
No go.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.951
Nothing's gonna surprise us, no.

00:35:31.824 --> 00:35:34.305
Announce this week's schedule!

00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:37.507
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:35:37.567 --> 00:35:40.908
For Ruffians joining us through the archive today too!

00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:43.369
Here is your FUWAMOCO word!

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.030
It's BAU BAU!

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.311
BAUTIFUL MERCH!

00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:48.872
BAU BAU!

00:35:49.953 --> 00:35:56.317
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:56.697 --> 00:35:58.799
Do your best to sleep well today!

00:35:58.819 --> 00:36:00.060
