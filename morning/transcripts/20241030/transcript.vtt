00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:16.154
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:20.276
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:23.118
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:23.258 --> 00:05:26.881
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:30.683
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:33.485
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:44.636
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:52.060
Thank you Ruffians for joining us here today for our 139th episode!

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.242
139th year of the Hydraulics Wiki today!

00:05:56.402 --> 00:05:59.164
But maybe there might be issues again, huh?

00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:00.564
BAU BAU!

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:05.429
Hello!

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.930
FUWAMO friends may be joining us today for the very first time!

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.451
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:18.052
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:19.992
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:21.952
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:27.854
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:28.274 --> 00:06:32.515
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:33.995
Hashtag.

00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.583
FWMCMORNING!

00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:42.345
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:45.027
BAU BAU!

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.769
Thank you Ruffians!

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.810
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.110
BAU BAU!

00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:57.472
We should get the hashtag #button, huh Moco-chan?

00:06:58.393 --> 00:07:00.934
Hashtag #button the doggy part!

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.611
What is that?

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.272
When you press it there's a hashtag.

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:08.053
This is hashtag.

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:13.215
BAU BAU!

00:07:13.296 --> 00:07:14.536
Ruffians!

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:16.237
It's the middle of the week.

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.198
Are you ready to go?

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:20.319
Feeling energized!

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.941
Maybe not quite yet.

00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:24.362
Maybe still a bit sleepy.

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:27.036
That's okay, Ruffians!

00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:30.857
Let's start the day together, ha!

00:07:31.498 --> 00:07:35.339
FUWAMOCO-chan, let's start it out on the best paw ever!

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:39.181
I raise you good.

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:43.083
That was some exciting things, right Moco-chan?

00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.484
Something other than what's about to happen.

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.226
Do we take the bandaid off first, Ruffians?

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:50.579
Hai.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.720
You just woke up?

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.901
Time to pull the bandaid off!

00:07:53.003 --> 00:08:05.629
Pull the band-aid off!

00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:08.955
Please do it off.

00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:09.196
Rip it off!

00:08:09.216 --> 00:08:12.062
I don't want to see the parasite, Moco-chan!

00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:17.012
What kind of trouble have you been in recently?

00:08:17.032 --> 00:08:18.234
Danger!

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:18.600
BAU BAU

00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:21.773
Is this a bad one?

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.274
I don't know.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.476
Let's take a look.

00:08:28.297 --> 00:08:29.617
De-den!

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:30.738
BAU BAU!

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.540
Oh my gosh, what is this?

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.101
The most terrifying pumpkin!

00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:39.442
Behold, Pero!

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:43.104
I behold and I don't like it.

00:08:43.144 --> 00:08:43.805
Don't look at it.

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:45.838
BAU BAU.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.500
I don't know, Ruffians!

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.204
If you saw a house with a pumpkin like this in front of it, what would you do?

00:08:53.424 --> 00:08:54.765
I don't know.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:56.947
I think it's best you don't approach it.

00:08:57.587 --> 00:08:58.528
Don't approach the house.

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.410
Stay far away.

00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.512
You kicked the pumpkin!

00:09:03.612 --> 00:09:05.033
Oh, that's right!

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:06.093
It's right!

00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:06.694
It is!

00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:08.115
Pat the pumpkin!

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:09.696
You eat the pumpkin!

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:10.757
Eat the pumpkin!

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:11.718
That's kind of nice.

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.419
You might have to have some very strong teeth, though.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.682
They might have nasty candy, see?

00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:18.962
Right?

00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.604
I think it's best you don't go.

00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:22.985
Yeah, go to a different house, you know?

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:26.507
With maybe a less nasty pumpkin.

00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:31.911
Less nasty pumpkin equals more delicious candy, right?

00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:33.252
More candy, yeah!

00:09:33.412 --> 00:09:34.293
What did you say?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.841
Trick or treat at this house?

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.403
Or maybe a big BAU BAU?

00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:43.224
Probably a big BAU BAU, right?

00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:43.985
Probably, yeah.

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:45.145
That's what I was thinking.

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:47.827
But then you were thinking it too hard.

00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:49.608
I was thinking it too, yeah.

00:09:49.768 --> 00:09:51.629
Probably a big BAU BAU.

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:52.429
BAU BAU!

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.611
BAU BAU!

00:09:57.032 --> 00:09:57.812
BAU BAU!

00:09:57.872 --> 00:09:59.072
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:16.745
There's something else that's happening on Halloween very shortly.

00:10:16.785 --> 00:10:19.448
Let's take a look at some exciting stuff!

00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:19.548
Yes!

00:10:19.628 --> 00:10:26.636
Kawaii-senpai has a very exciting 3D live come out on Halloween in Japan!

00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:29.019
It's called G-Rub in Jigoku!

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.461
J-Rap in Jigoku!

00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:33.483
It's more Halloween themed.

00:10:33.523 --> 00:10:36.305
Like, Calli-senpai is already pretty spooky, no?

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:40.729
So it's sort of counter-weeping.

00:10:40.969 --> 00:10:48.275
Not only is it gonna be J-Rap, but Calli-senpai also has a new 3D model that she's gonna be revealing.

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.358
But, also!

00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:52.839
Well, FUWAMOCO!

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:55.762
We're gonna be there as guests!

00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:02.503
It's gonna be on the 31st at 5am PT.

00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:03.203
A bit early.

00:11:27.912 --> 00:11:32.876
A little bit of an early day, but we hope that you'll be the- look at us there!

00:11:32.896 --> 00:11:34.397
Be the coolest dogs ever!

00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:35.118
Yeah!

00:11:35.138 --> 00:11:36.078
We can guarantee it!

00:11:36.118 --> 00:11:37.339
Damnit dog!

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:37.720
Yeah!

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.900
Right, Ruffians?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.221
Huh?

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:41.522
We're cool, right?

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:42.443
Extra chilly?

00:11:42.863 --> 00:11:43.024
No!

00:11:43.144 --> 00:11:44.044
Extra cool!

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:46.026
Can't you see our cool poses?

00:11:46.246 --> 00:11:46.786
Huh?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:47.407
Yeah!

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:48.208
Right!

00:11:48.748 --> 00:11:49.428
Right!

00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:49.569
Cool!

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:50.249
Cool, right?

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:50.649
Cool?

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.591
You'll be there, FUWAMOCO!

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.192
Extremely cool baby!

00:11:55.232 --> 00:11:57.574
Cool, the coolest!

00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:58.114
Yes!

00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:02.557
If only we had a kite and the hat's kinda like cowling silk by then.

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:04.879
Although it might be uncomfortable for our ears.

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:07.160
Do they make one so the ears can come out?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.002
Is there a hat with the ear holes?

00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:12.704
If our ears dig out of them, will we still be cool though?

00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:13.885
That's the question.

00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:19.078
You would think we would be cooler with hats with the ear holes.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.741
Cute way to cool!

00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:24.611
We're cool here, okay?

00:12:24.732 --> 00:12:25.592
Use your eyes.

00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:26.892
You can see.

00:12:27.272 --> 00:12:29.713
Very, very cool.

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:37.035
But we hope that you'll watch and you'll see us there together with Calli-senpai for the first time in 3 days.

00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:40.556
Rapping and being the coolest demon dogs.

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:42.697
Start your Halloween off with this.

00:12:42.777 --> 00:12:44.598
Please check it out, okay?

00:12:44.718 --> 00:12:45.298
Ruffians!

00:12:45.358 --> 00:12:45.778
BAU BAU!

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:55.639
FUWAMOCO, we also got a special delivery this year.

00:12:55.939 --> 00:12:57.900
You might have heard about it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.082
hololive just released their first TCG!

00:13:01.142 --> 00:13:05.624
The hololive Official Card Game!

00:13:05.864 --> 00:13:07.025
And the delivery!

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:10.770
It was a bunch of cards!

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.191
Yeah!

00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:15.814
We got one set for me, one set for Moco-chan!

00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:16.675
Yeah!

00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.837
And they even said, FUWAMOCO, do you want some more?

00:13:19.858 --> 00:13:21.519
We're like, oh, yes please!

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:22.019
Yes!

00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:22.880
Yeah!

00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:25.882
And well, you know what?

00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:27.644
We got a small package!

00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:28.024
Yes!

00:13:28.304 --> 00:13:29.785
And we got a big package!

00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:32.628
And we're like, oh, okay, maybe the big package is probably something else.

00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:34.609
Probably the small one, you know?

00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:35.330
Right!

00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:40.227
It was the big one.

00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.149
It was the big one!

00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:47.412
That's huge, Ruffians!

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:49.813
Can you guess how many we received?

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.294
How many?

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:53.116
How many booster packs?

00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:19.752
We bought 240 booster packs!

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:20.250
240!

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:24.377
That's insane Ruffians!

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.199
We can't do that, we can't do that.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:29.082
How long did it take to open one booster pack?

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:32.762
I don't know, we're not the best at that kind of thing.

00:14:32.782 --> 00:14:35.404
I don't have that much experience.

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:37.086
It's huge, right?

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:37.567
We do!

00:14:37.587 --> 00:14:39.249
Calli-senpai!

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:43.253
She had a bunch of fun opening the most cheap couple days ago!

00:14:43.794 --> 00:14:47.578
And she even got the rare Suisei-senpai card!

00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:52.758
Ruffians, would you want something like that from us?

00:14:53.138 --> 00:14:54.099
Card opening.

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:58.260
We haven't played the TCG simulator.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.840
No, no, we haven't played that game.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.921
We don't have to play the simulator anymore.

00:15:02.941 --> 00:15:05.082
Yeah, we don't have the simulator.

00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:08.463
We can open the cards ourselves.

00:15:08.643 --> 00:15:09.263
Yeah.

00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:09.863
Yeah.

00:15:09.923 --> 00:15:11.604
I see only yes, I don't see no.

00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.264
I saw a shirt.

00:15:12.284 --> 00:15:12.984
A shirt.

00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:13.864
He's up on it.

00:15:13.884 --> 00:15:14.925
He's very polite.

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:23.452
But Ruffians, I don't know, it might take us quite a while to open them with our paws though.

00:15:24.453 --> 00:15:25.914
I don't know Moco-chan.

00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:29.978
We'll have to see it!

00:15:30.018 --> 00:15:32.461
But please check that out too Ruffians!

00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:33.842
BAU BAU!

00:15:35.153 --> 00:15:37.177
Opening battle!

00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:51.287
Who can open the booster pack?

00:15:51.727 --> 00:15:52.768
Who can open it faster?

00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:54.129
Is that what's important?

00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:55.310
That's what's important.

00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:57.492
BAU BAU!

00:15:57.532 --> 00:15:58.333
BAU BAU!

00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:00.415
Who else is more excited?

00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:01.996
Halloween's Booking!

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:03.317
Brand new news!

00:16:03.617 --> 00:16:05.259
Wow, IRyS-senpai!

00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:09.422
She just announced that she'll be having a brand new Booking!

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:11.024
This will come out.

00:16:11.424 --> 00:16:12.625
I'm imagining!

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:13.846
I'm gonna cry!

00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:14.707
BAU BAU!

00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:20.852
We're really excited to hear IRyS-senpai's earring!

00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:23.754
We both really really like it.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:26.597
It has quite an earring vibe to it.

00:16:27.117 --> 00:16:33.622
So we hope Ruffians will give it a listen before we get into the Halloween season with it!

00:16:34.804 --> 00:16:37.567
It's going to be coming out not too long from now.

00:16:37.607 --> 00:16:42.113
In about 12 hours it will be premiering at 8pm PT.

00:16:42.173 --> 00:16:45.918
So please go check it out on Aya-senpai's channel.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.860
BABYMETAL's NAKISO.

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:53.654
You have to check it out, okay?

00:16:53.734 --> 00:16:54.055
Yeah!

00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:56.818
Oh, have we listened to Elizabeth Blackbird?

00:16:57.158 --> 00:16:58.279
We did!

00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:00.601
It was amazing!

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:03.864
Please check it out too, Carol-P!

00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:06.227
Moco-chan was dancing a little bit.

00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:08.969
Interpretive dance.

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:10.630
Interpretive dance.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.652
Please check it out!

00:17:15.052 --> 00:17:16.933
BAU BAU!

00:17:18.894 --> 00:17:25.178
You know, not only is Aya-senpai getting into the halloween spirit, but Shiori!

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:28.880
Shiori-chan has a very smooth... Did you say Shiori-chan?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.680
Shiori-chan.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.521
Cause I love Shiori too.

00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:31.861
Cool!

00:17:33.382 --> 00:17:34.463
Nerissa-chan!

00:17:34.543 --> 00:17:35.323
Biboo-chan!

00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:36.384
Shiori-chan!

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:45.468
But she's gonna be having a very spooky 3D Halloween theme coming up.

00:17:45.668 --> 00:17:47.929
It starts at 6pm today.

00:17:48.389 --> 00:17:54.893
It's not quite Halloween, but everybody's starting it off early because Halloween is awesome!

00:17:55.753 --> 00:17:56.914
Extra extra fun!

00:17:58.454 --> 00:18:02.237
Shiori is working super hard for this team.

00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:03.878
Doing all these kinds of things.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.859
Preparations for months and months.

00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:09.761
Yeah, we're sure it's going to be super duper fun!

00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:13.303
You know, she's gotten a bunch of help and support from the Novelians.

00:18:14.754 --> 00:18:17.075
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.256
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:18.316 --> 00:18:20.137
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:39.887
Ah, Halloween.

00:18:40.227 --> 00:18:40.607
Why?

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:42.568
You know, it's just like Halloween, senpai.

00:18:42.668 --> 00:18:44.788
It's kind of, you know.

00:18:45.369 --> 00:18:48.750
So, what is Miss Halloween gonna do for us?

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.591
Lots of Halloween streams this week.

00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:51.091
Why?

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:51.771
I wonder why.

00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:53.532
I wonder why, huh?

00:18:54.352 --> 00:18:59.594
But we're really looking forward to seeing what she is working so hard to create.

00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:02.195
Please check it out on camera!

00:19:02.275 --> 00:19:04.616
It's 6pm PTM today.

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:06.117
Shiori is always nice.

00:19:06.983 --> 00:19:07.204
No.

00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:10.561
Correction, Shiori is always cute.

00:19:13.628 --> 00:19:15.769
But today, extra spooky.

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:20.510
BAU BAU!

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.410
I'm so excited.

00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:25.611
I can guarantee one thing though, Shiori-chan.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.692
Shiori-chan, this is very weird.

00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:28.752
This is very weird.

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.032
Can you stop that?

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.453
Shiori's eyes are probably gonna be glowing.

00:19:33.553 --> 00:19:36.474
Shiori-chan, all of a sudden you've never said this.

00:19:36.554 --> 00:19:39.954
Maybe she's dressing up as Shiori-chan for Halloween, huh?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:40.735
Who is that?

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:50.622
BAU BAU!

00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:55.586
We had something very exciting happen here with us!

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:56.306
On Twitter!

00:19:56.346 --> 00:19:56.907
On Twitter!

00:19:57.007 --> 00:19:58.468
We are super surprised!

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:06.214
Because it looks like the Queer and Pop Team Epic, Boku Musou, sent you us FUWAMOCO!

00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:08.656
Ruffians!

00:20:08.776 --> 00:20:10.677
Ruffians!

00:20:10.697 --> 00:20:10.857
So cute!

00:20:10.977 --> 00:20:12.338
We're on it!

00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:13.219
Yeah!

00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:15.740
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.541
So cute!

00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:23.865
Yeah, you know, we saw some Ruffians say, you know, what was FUWAMOCO's pop team epic debut?

00:20:23.985 --> 00:20:24.465
What?

00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:26.206
I don't know about that.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.107
Maybe that would be more like...

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:30.388
Pup team epic?

00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:32.349
Pup team epic!

00:20:32.369 --> 00:20:34.030
I don't know, Rubin.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:39.032
I don't think we're silly enough to be able to keep up with that kind of world, you know?

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.392
What do you think, Kai?

00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:43.253
Maybe?

00:20:43.273 --> 00:20:43.714
Maybe not.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.411
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:53.194
You look super cute here though!

00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:59.139
Thank you so much Mocobo-sensei for the super special illustration!

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:00.800
BAU BAU!

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:04.063
BAU BAU!

00:21:22.044 --> 00:21:23.325
That would be a great emote.

00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:25.928
It's just great all around, you know.

00:21:25.948 --> 00:21:26.168
Yes!

00:21:26.228 --> 00:21:27.929
Wonderful!

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.251
BAU BAU!

00:21:30.932 --> 00:21:32.113
Wow, Ruffians.

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.096
Actually, today's FUWAMOCO.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:37.537
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:58.984
It's a bit chilly.

00:21:59.004 --> 00:22:00.064
Yeah.

00:22:00.745 --> 00:22:03.627
Although I did get a little bit scared, Ruffians.

00:22:04.147 --> 00:22:06.769
Because you know, we got out of an elevator.

00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:13.833
And then right in front of us as the doors opened, there was a cute little girl just sitting in front of us.

00:22:14.474 --> 00:22:17.256
And I thought, and I thought it's dark water!

00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:22.139
You know, we just watched the horror movie Dark Water together in the Doggy Pack.

00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:23.500
She was a bit startled.

00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:26.593
I was a little scared!

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:29.076
And I was like, what's wrong?

00:22:29.456 --> 00:22:30.918
She's like, startled.

00:22:30.978 --> 00:22:32.660
Wait, did you startle the little girl?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.962
She goes, no, I was startled by the little girl!

00:22:40.428 --> 00:22:44.272
She did not have a red bag, no.

00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:46.534
It's okay, I survived, Ruffians.

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:53.221
We went on a nice walk, we got something warm to drink.

00:22:53.381 --> 00:23:01.608
And you know while we were walking around, Fuwawa started singing Haru Ichiban, a song by the Counties.

00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:03.670
And you know it's kind of a spring song.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.654
I don't know why, but he just kind of came into my head.

00:23:07.754 --> 00:23:10.076
It was not spring anymore!

00:23:10.096 --> 00:23:12.978
He came into my head and I just felt like, oh...

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:16.303
You don't want to drink falling leaves!

00:23:16.884 --> 00:23:18.547
And that's what she's singing.

00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:21.075
Spring song.

00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:23.236
I don't know.

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:26.176
It's always good for a good song.

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.817
It's basically winter.

00:23:28.857 --> 00:23:29.177
Yeah.

00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:29.757
No.

00:23:31.117 --> 00:23:34.138
You know, it can be spring inside your heart whenever, right?

00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:35.258
Exactly.

00:23:35.698 --> 00:23:37.219
Sing it if you feel like it.

00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:39.359
Yeah, you know.

00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:41.740
It's against the season, huh?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.660
What song should I have sung, Moco-chan?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.361
How many ball songs are there?

00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:51.927
Konayuki ga sawa.

00:23:52.007 --> 00:23:53.109
That's winter!

00:23:56.794 --> 00:23:58.336
I can only think of one thing.

00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:00.319
Is there anything about falling leaves?

00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:06.006
Konayuki don't seem to understand.

00:24:06.748 --> 00:24:08.709
That's the only thing I need for fall.

00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:13.850
Is that a fall song?

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.731
I don't know!

00:24:16.832 --> 00:24:17.972
Is that a fall song?

00:24:18.552 --> 00:24:22.273
Maybe you can't find any fall songs, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:24:22.674 --> 00:24:23.134
Maybe.

00:24:23.694 --> 00:24:27.195
But it was really nice, FUWAMOCO!

00:24:27.915 --> 00:24:33.277
I hope that you can get out for some really nice autumn walks too.

00:24:35.618 --> 00:24:36.559
BAU BAU!

00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:39.620
BAU BAU!

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.000
BAU BAU!

00:24:59.728 --> 00:25:01.229
It's a little bit scary.

00:25:19.353 --> 00:25:20.694
Are you gonna pick me up?

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:21.454
Yeah.

00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:26.176
I need a little bit of a... This is like a puppy up.

00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:28.958
I need a pup talk, Moco-chan!

00:25:29.098 --> 00:25:33.220
I can't deal with the fact that year is about to end!

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.080
Moco-chan!

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.561
Ruffians!

00:25:44.942 --> 00:25:46.502
It's that time again!

00:25:47.303 --> 00:25:49.023
One last time!

00:25:50.003 --> 00:25:52.744
This here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:25:53.564 --> 00:25:57.825
And that means you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:25:57.885 --> 00:25:58.505
Mococo!

00:26:01.406 --> 00:26:02.386
Ruffians!

00:26:03.306 --> 00:26:04.906
Ruffians!

00:26:05.747 --> 00:26:06.667
How are you feeling?

00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:07.827
Huh?

00:26:09.487 --> 00:26:11.808
Has it been a bit rough recently?

00:26:13.408 --> 00:26:14.989
We know it's difficult, you know?

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.952
It's getting colder, things are changing.

00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:30.361
It can be scary, but sometimes it's very necessary to be able to get a bit of a breather and a change of scenery just to realize how important things are and how they impact your life as well.

00:26:31.842 --> 00:26:33.964
We know it can be uncomfy.

00:26:34.765 --> 00:26:35.665
It can be sad.

00:26:36.546 --> 00:26:38.488
But surely things will change for the better!

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.222
But some things also will never change too.

00:26:43.063 --> 00:26:46.986
And that thing is that... We'll be here!

00:26:47.626 --> 00:26:48.907
We'll always be here!

00:26:49.327 --> 00:26:51.129
We'll be here cheering you on, okay?

00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:54.471
And... Now we're here to protect your smile!

00:26:55.792 --> 00:26:56.913
We know that you can do it!

00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:59.075
No matter how many times you stumble.

00:26:59.655 --> 00:27:02.037
And we'll show you that we're the same too, okay?

00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:05.800
Let's keep on standing up and keep going forward.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.580
Got it?

00:27:07.521 --> 00:27:09.103
We're always with you Ruffians!

00:27:09.163 --> 00:27:10.764
Let's do our best!

00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:12.686
You can do it!

00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:15.208
Ganbatte de!

00:27:15.528 --> 00:27:17.090
BAU BAU!

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.972
BAU BAU!

00:27:20.553 --> 00:27:21.533
Thank you FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:27:21.613 --> 00:27:22.654
You got it!

00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:23.835
Understood!

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:27.158
I saw Ruffians be like, yes boss, got it boss.

00:27:27.258 --> 00:27:27.879
Good!

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:28.399
You understand!

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:28.700
BAU BAU!

00:27:33.258 --> 00:27:35.520
Let's do our best, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.022
Right through the end of the year into 2025!

00:27:39.102 --> 00:27:40.583
FUWAMOCO!

00:27:41.003 --> 00:27:46.147
Let's look at our Doggie of the Day!

00:27:46.227 --> 00:27:49.069
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Fluffy and Fuzzy!

00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:49.629
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:00.692 --> 00:28:02.674
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:04.095
Have a howl of a day!

00:28:16.253 --> 00:28:18.655
We love having guests to FUWAMOCO!

00:28:18.835 --> 00:28:22.298
It's just like us too!

00:28:22.338 --> 00:28:24.179
Little FUWAMOCO!

00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:26.601
Ruffians, are you confused?

00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:27.761
Moco-chan.

00:28:27.982 --> 00:28:28.262
Hai?

00:28:29.243 --> 00:28:30.503
This is a competition.

00:28:30.523 --> 00:28:31.744
Competition?

00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.626
But why is FUWAMOCO here?

00:28:34.987 --> 00:28:36.808
I don't know, but give me FUWAMOCO and FUWAMOCO!

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.829
Why is it a competition?

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.511
The answer is obvious!

00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:43.488
I guess there's no competition, huh?

00:28:44.048 --> 00:28:47.630
We're still puppies, but we're grown-up puppies.

00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:52.053
They're super cute though!

00:28:52.093 --> 00:28:54.895
They're being cute!

00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:56.595
They're puffy and fuzzy.

00:28:56.676 --> 00:28:57.476
BAU BAU!

00:28:57.496 --> 00:29:00.037
BAU BAU!

00:29:02.013 --> 00:29:02.873
BAU BAU!

00:29:02.893 --> 00:29:04.114
Like that.

00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:06.634
BAU BAU!

00:29:07.615 --> 00:29:08.455
Maybe.

00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:10.235
BAU BAU!

00:29:10.956 --> 00:29:12.896
BAU BAU!

00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:24.980
Why, you know, we sure that if we'll be a fuzzy or anything like us, that they'll always be the best of friends and get along super well, even though they might fight over food or pizza.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.942
Toys, dolls, beds, toys, yeah.

00:29:28.543 --> 00:29:30.224
You name it!

00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:34.808
Oh, I sure love these super happy puppies!

00:29:35.168 --> 00:29:41.974
They get to go on lots of walks and you know, get to have some intense fun in some deep mud puddles!

00:29:42.435 --> 00:29:43.235
Leaf puddles?

00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:44.777
Piles?

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:45.477
Yes!

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.798
BAU BAU!

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:47.118
So cute!

00:29:55.512 --> 00:29:57.855
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:29:57.875 --> 00:30:01.378
We have... De-den!

00:30:01.438 --> 00:30:07.624
Speaking of leaf piles, huh?

00:30:07.744 --> 00:30:09.225
Beautiful!

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.207
That's a really nice auto-walk.

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:13.249
Even nicer than my walk, huh?

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:14.550
A lot more leaves, huh?

00:30:15.737 --> 00:30:19.058
Ruffians, it looks like you got into some of the leaf piles there.

00:30:19.158 --> 00:30:22.099
Is that actually a leaf pile or is it just the ground?

00:30:22.339 --> 00:30:24.600
It's just that many leaves.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.100
So many leaves.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.221
I don't think it's a pile, I just think that's how it is.

00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:31.302
Right!

00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:33.662
I feel like I can smell the leaves.

00:30:33.962 --> 00:30:34.383
Right!

00:30:34.463 --> 00:30:36.383
Can you smell it, Ruffians?

00:30:37.123 --> 00:30:37.603
What is it?

00:30:38.424 --> 00:30:39.184
Crispy.

00:30:39.564 --> 00:30:41.425
Crispy smell.

00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:42.825
Dirt.

00:30:44.525 --> 00:30:45.305
Can you smell it?

00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:46.606
Can you smell the dirt?

00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:48.026
I can smell it.

00:30:48.066 --> 00:30:49.086
You can smell it.

00:30:50.367 --> 00:30:50.687
Yeah.

00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:51.927
Crispy a little bit?

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:52.427
Yes.

00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:54.148
Leaf carpet.

00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:54.608
Yes.

00:30:55.428 --> 00:30:57.349
So nice.

00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:58.009
Crunchy.

00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:01.230
Hopefully crunchy under your feet and not in your teeth.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.730
Yeah.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.710
Don't eat the leaves.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.491
Love them.

00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:05.891
Don't eat them.

00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:06.991
Got it.

00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:09.092
BAU BAU!

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:13.910
Wow, let's take a look at our Question of the Day today!

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.331
Our Question of the Day is... Today!

00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:20.672
I have a question for FUWAMOCO!

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:24.653
Since the Akibamise has shut down... It hasn't yet.

00:31:24.974 --> 00:31:25.754
Soon, very soon.

00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:37.476
Is there another go-to Mister Donut location that you would suggest Ruffians should head to for condomings if they visit Tokyo?

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:44.703
Like Moco-chan said, you know Akihabara store is still gonna be open for a few more hours here today.

00:31:45.044 --> 00:31:46.165
It's closed right now.

00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:47.446
It's closed right now.

00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:51.589
In a few hours, it'll be open again for the last time.

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:58.172
But, you know, it's hard because, you know, it can't really replace FUWAMOCO.

00:31:58.352 --> 00:31:59.533
It can't be replaced.

00:32:00.093 --> 00:32:08.537
But, you know, for FUWAMOCO reasons, let the Ruffians go and have yummy pomeranians and a nice break at all locations.

00:32:08.617 --> 00:32:13.779
You know, whichever is most cozy, most convenient.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:14.700
But,

00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:26.707
If we had to recommend just a location, you know, there's another very special Mitsu-do right outside of the Nakano Broadway.

00:32:26.747 --> 00:32:30.549
You know, they have a lot of anime stars.

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:35.552
So you know, Akiba's nice, Nakano Broadway nice, and there is a

00:32:35.812 --> 00:32:40.614
You know they also have the donut buffet there, so you can sign up for that if you want to!

00:33:04.303 --> 00:33:06.465
You can't just be like, I want the buffet now.

00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:07.226
No, you can't.

00:33:08.226 --> 00:33:10.828
You have to prepare your hunger in advance.

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:15.492
But you know that's where we went together with Advent!

00:33:16.033 --> 00:33:17.094
It was super fun!

00:33:17.374 --> 00:33:19.976
We have good memories there too.

00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:22.018
You know, when we were there together with Advent!

00:33:22.198 --> 00:33:24.700
Yeah, trying to carry all the donuts!

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.762
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:26.782 --> 00:33:28.144
Have a howl of a day!

00:33:28.204 --> 00:33:30.707
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:33:30.727 --> 00:33:32.829
Have a howl of a day!

00:33:42.757 --> 00:33:46.379
It's like Shiori kept on helping me carry trees.

00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:47.700
It's so hard.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.001
Up the stairs.

00:33:49.301 --> 00:33:50.542
Up the stairs.

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.163
Yeah.

00:33:53.224 --> 00:33:54.444
So you know.

00:33:54.584 --> 00:33:57.886
But whichever you know is good for you.

00:33:58.387 --> 00:33:58.527
Yeah.

00:33:58.567 --> 00:34:00.028
We hope that you enjoy it!

00:34:00.088 --> 00:34:00.828
We're about to ponder.

00:34:00.928 --> 00:34:02.529
It's time for a little bit of pondering.

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.629
Open!

00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:09.756
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:34:09.896 --> 00:34:22.524
There's still gonna be one FUWAMOCO Morning before hibernation, so we hope that you'll share your walks, your doggy of a day, your Pero Sightings, too, and any other questions you might have with the hashtag.

00:34:22.904 --> 00:34:25.826
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:34:26.227 --> 00:34:28.128
BAU BAU!

00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:32.050
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.331
Next stream is...

00:34:36.193 --> 00:34:39.174
Goodbye Akiba MisDo Studio!

00:34:39.694 --> 00:34:45.717
It's gonna be a little bit later than usual at midnight PT, so technically Thursday.

00:34:45.937 --> 00:34:48.038
But there's a reason for that, okay?

00:34:48.118 --> 00:34:53.220
We wanna be able to spend the very last hour that Akiba MisDo's gonna be open.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.921
Together with you, Ruffians, you know.

00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:57.842
Our last time going!

00:34:57.883 --> 00:35:03.146
You know, we're really happy to be able to share a very special place together with you, Ruffians.

00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:12.271
But you know, this time, we can say goodbye to Akiba MisDo all together like this, so we're really looking forward to it, Ruffians.

00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:14.592
We hope you'll be there with us!

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.594
BAU BAU!

00:35:17.614 --> 00:35:21.176
And let's take another look at our schedule here.

00:35:21.757 --> 00:35:30.922
Well, on Thursday, we're gonna be helping out the investigation at Justice's Market Investigation in VRChat!

00:35:31.002 --> 00:35:35.645
It's gonna be our first time playing VRChat and it looks like a lot of fun.

00:35:35.665 --> 00:35:38.227
It looks like it'll be really cute and not scary.

00:35:38.267 --> 00:35:38.467
Right?

00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:38.767
Right?

00:35:38.827 --> 00:35:39.507
Not scary, right?

00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:40.228
Not scary, yeah?

00:35:40.788 --> 00:35:45.132
So, we hope that you'll join us in Justice's first Halloween.

00:35:45.193 --> 00:35:46.734
It's not a cup, we're helping!

00:35:46.754 --> 00:35:47.415
Who cares?

00:35:47.755 --> 00:35:49.357
Justice's first Halloween.

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:50.658
Those are the babies.

00:35:51.759 --> 00:35:54.181
They don't know what Halloween is, huh?

00:35:54.221 --> 00:35:56.243
We gotta show them what Halloween is, yeah.

00:35:56.564 --> 00:35:57.284
Is that what we're doing?

00:35:57.364 --> 00:35:58.285
I don't think so.

00:35:58.365 --> 00:35:58.766
We'll see ya!

00:35:58.826 --> 00:35:59.527
We're investigating.

00:36:00.227 --> 00:36:09.314
But then after that, at 10pm PT, we're also gonna be doing a little bit of silly 3D trick or treating together with you Ruffians.

00:36:09.354 --> 00:36:14.138
We just wanted to spend a little bit of Halloween together with you.

00:36:14.478 --> 00:36:20.843
So we hope that maybe you'll share some of your candy with us and that we don't need to play any tricks.

00:36:21.664 --> 00:36:21.964
Right.

00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:23.025
Yeah.

00:36:23.145 --> 00:36:23.725
No tricks.

00:36:23.846 --> 00:36:24.126
Right.

00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:24.726
Yeah.

00:36:25.127 --> 00:36:25.387
BAU BAU!

00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:34.951
And on Friday we have our last FUWAMOCO Morning before Hibernation with the last FUWAMOCO Morning this year.

00:36:34.971 --> 00:36:37.872
So we hope that you'll spend it together with us.

00:36:38.392 --> 00:36:44.053
But on the weekend, starting on Friday evening, we're gonna be getting into some monkey business.

00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:45.414
Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:48.096
It's always a crazy time.

00:36:48.216 --> 00:36:53.020
And then Saturday, a little bit more relaxed as we try to learn the ropes of Minecraft.

00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:53.781
Again.

00:36:53.801 --> 00:36:54.402
Again.

00:36:54.502 --> 00:36:57.084
Just the two of us and you, Ruffians.

00:36:57.385 --> 00:37:01.288
So please, really, please help us out because we really don't understand.

00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:05.092
What is common sense in Minecraft is not common sense to us.

00:37:05.292 --> 00:37:08.596
You put the stuff in the shape and it becomes the stuff.

00:37:09.893 --> 00:37:10.693
That doesn't make sense.

00:37:10.713 --> 00:37:11.834
How is that common sense?

00:37:12.054 --> 00:37:12.294
Hi.

00:37:13.034 --> 00:37:13.315
It's Moc.

00:37:13.335 --> 00:37:14.155
Please help us.

00:37:14.915 --> 00:37:15.736
BAU BAU!

00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:17.096

00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:20.898
