00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:11.393

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:12.215
Morning!

00:07:12.275 --> 00:07:13.617
Good job!

00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:13.838

00:07:13.918 --> 00:07:14.900
BAU BAU!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.707
That means we're gonna have a bunch of fun doing this, of course.

00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:19.067
We can!

00:07:19.488 --> 00:07:20.029
But!

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.439
Before that, Moco-chan, we have some very exciting things to share with the Ruffians, right?

00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:29.426
First!

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:29.566
Huh?

00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:29.707
First!

00:07:29.727 --> 00:07:30.007
First!

00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:32.672
There's that one, right?

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:43.106
You need the news!

00:07:43.447 --> 00:07:44.549
To be informed!

00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.434
Information!

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.743
Sometimes information's scary, no?

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:58.756
There's been another... Pero Sighting.

00:07:58.776 --> 00:07:59.217
Pero Sighting.

00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:03.158
Well, maybe this is important information.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:05.602
Okay, listen up Ruffians!

00:08:05.642 --> 00:08:05.842
Listen up!

00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:06.683
Okay, we're gonna take a look.

00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:09.287
Okay, where was Pero Sighted this time?

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:11.831
De-den!

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:13.353
Oh!

00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.756
That's a collection!

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:18.981
A collection with a nasty problem in it!

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:23.367
That is an important site.

00:08:23.387 --> 00:08:23.568
Yeah.

00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:24.529
Right in the middle.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.895
Pero, stop taking up some very important space there.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:33.902
You can throw him out!

00:08:33.922 --> 00:08:34.323
Get rid of him!

00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:36.709
Throw him in the garbage!

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.396
Ruffians, you know what we're gonna say, right?

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:45.652
There's some more super cute FUWAMOCO merch still to come!

00:08:45.672 --> 00:08:53.424
So you need to make sure you know that Pero isn't taking up any unnecessary room in there with her treasures!

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:55.127
Those are her treasures!

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:03.019
That's not where it is.

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:03.460
Pretty nasty.

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:06.040
It's a place for treasures.

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:30.656
It's a place for treasures.

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:31.217
It's a place for treasures.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:31.557
It's a place for

00:09:32.903 --> 00:09:34.987
It's a hat, Moco-chan!

00:09:35.027 --> 00:09:37.552
I got confused, I had to take a look at what was in the photo!

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:41.439
That would be a different collection.

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:45.126
Not a collection?

00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:46.669
No, this is the best collection.

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:47.571
A nice collection!

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.104
But you know, it's time to toss him out.

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:56.831
Maybe you can lure him out of there with some poisoning.

00:09:57.672 --> 00:09:59.755
Well, good luck!

00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:01.638
I hope he doesn't turn on you.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.142
Be careful.

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:08.869
BAU BAU!

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:10.892
Misunderstanding!

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.221
Huh?

00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:12.621
Huh?

00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:14.424
No misunderstanding!

00:10:14.444 --> 00:10:16.587
It's been cleared out!

00:10:16.607 --> 00:10:19.591
It's done.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.155
BAU BAU!

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:29.746
No misunderstandings!

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:31.970
But you're my sister, Moco-chan.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.213
Why?

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.276
Have a howl of a day!

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:39.476
Nice!

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.498
Ruffians!

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.243
This is so very exciting news!

00:10:43.964 --> 00:10:45.126
It's official!

00:10:45.447 --> 00:10:54.183
You can now find FUWAMOCO whenever you go to FamilyMart in Japan!

00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:56.607
Live right now with me!

00:10:56.587 --> 00:11:08.316
Whenever you get two of the special gummies, then you can get a very special clear folder with FUWAMOCO on it!

00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:14.511
With Airi-senpai, Kaori-senpai, Bayi-senpai, and taking away hololive!

00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:16.073
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:17.155
But it's very specific.

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:18.717
Paper gummies, okay?

00:11:18.737 --> 00:11:18.997
Yeah, okay.

00:11:19.418 --> 00:11:21.440
These are the really good gummies, okay?

00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:25.265
Yeah, because you know, you can get like gummy bears and be like, oh nice.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:25.886
One, two.

00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:27.929
Two bites and the gummy bear is gone.

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:28.770
It's gone, right?

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.432
You pulverized it with your teeth.

00:11:30.833 --> 00:11:32.956
These are special gummies, okay?

00:11:33.216 --> 00:11:34.898
They're like, I know you have a chin.

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.442
And you're gonna be using it.

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:38.183
You're gonna use the jaw.

00:11:38.203 --> 00:11:39.585
Yes, all the teeth.

00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:40.726
Yep, yep.

00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:42.068
You know it.

00:11:42.048 --> 00:11:58.588
Moco-chan, it's like you made the gummies you dreamt of!

00:11:58.568 --> 00:12:02.537
I like really hard gummies.

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:04.261
Yes!

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:05.504
But the flavors, okay?

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:10.035
Now pay attention because I want to ask Ruffians, what flavors?

00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:13.042
What flavor do you think FUWAMOCO?

00:12:13.382 --> 00:12:14.806
We're in charge of hard.

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:17.151
FUWAMOCO's flavors.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:19.468
I want to see.

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.471
I want to see Ruffians!

00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:25.257
Damede kowa!

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:29.544

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:30.526
That's correct!

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:33.811
Moco kowai!

00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:34.973
Moco kowai!

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.636
But, but the next question.

00:12:36.976 --> 00:12:43.046
Taro, Aira-senpai, Calli-senpai, Bay-senpai, what flavors are they in charge of?

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:43.146
Huh?

00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:46.311
That's the next question, huh?

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.044

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:14.796
Strawberry is bae

00:13:15.535 --> 00:13:24.432
Tofu flavor gummy!

00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:33.730
Energy drink flavor!

00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:35.424
Hard cola.

00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:37.307
Hard cola.

00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:38.028
Right there, Moco-chan.

00:13:38.228 --> 00:13:41.234
Soft, normal cola.

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:41.474
Fuzzy cola.

00:13:41.494 --> 00:13:42.596
Right, Moco-chan?

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:47.424
So you're gonna have to try Cali-senpai's hard cola.

00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:50.690
And compare it to Moco-chan's fuzzy cola, right?

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:52.573
What's the difference?

00:13:52.593 --> 00:13:53.614
You have to find out!

00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:55.718
Did we try both of them?

00:13:56.356 --> 00:14:01.104
Wow, with FUWAMOCO we went to go get our paws on them right away!

00:14:01.144 --> 00:14:04.330
Most of the gummies were sold out.

00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:12.844
So we haven't been able to compare the core flavors of Ruffians with the adult bouquets.

00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:14.748
And you know what?

00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:19.456
You have to buy two gummies to get one clear folder.

00:14:19.556 --> 00:14:20.878
So that means...

00:14:20.858 --> 00:14:23.243
Gotta get 4 gummies.

00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:28.412
You're gonna be known as the Ruffian that has all the gummies.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.597
Hand them out to your friends, okay?

00:14:30.617 --> 00:14:31.619
You can't eat them all yourself.

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:38.091
If you do, then maybe you might be trading in your jaw.

00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:40.406
You won't be chewing much else?

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:41.326
No.

00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:42.628
Just gummies.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.609
Yeah.

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:45.731
That's four days of gummies, okay?

00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:47.833
You're eating them right now!

00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:50.275
I hope you enjoy them!

00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:51.597
I can't wait to start the morning.

00:14:52.237 --> 00:14:52.738
Right.

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:54.319
Gummies and breakfast.

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:56.361
Well, you'll have to go and check out.

00:14:56.381 --> 00:15:00.746
Get your paws on your holo-ear and clear folders at FUWAMIMO.

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:03.308
Oh!

00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:04.890
FUWAMIMO's throughout Japan.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.651
Every single one.

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.432
That's a lot of FUWAMIMO's.

00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:07.993
FUWAMOCO.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:16.285
There might be some more surprises coming up soon.

00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:19.329
So keep your eyes on it, okay Ruffians?

00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:23.515
BAU BAU!

00:15:23.575 --> 00:15:27.921
We also have what the clear files look like.

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:31.146
Very helpful, very handy.

00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:34.394
I like the size too.

00:15:34.414 --> 00:15:37.960
I feel like the size isn't the standard full paper size.

00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:42.747
You know it makes it perfect for all those things you know.

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:46.352
If you want to put it in your bag but you don't have that much space.

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:48.235
A nice medium size.

00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:48.655
Yeah.

00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:50.818
Wait they're so cute!

00:15:50.838 --> 00:15:52.321
Thank you!

00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.542
BAU BAU!

00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:55.405
The paw press is cute.

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:55.545
Right!

00:15:55.565 --> 00:15:56.527
I like it.

00:15:56.547 --> 00:15:58.169
I like my press right now too.

00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.770
It's good to like it.

00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:02.791
BAU BAU!

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:16.219
There's also some other very exciting and very strong things happening!

00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:20.346
April Fool's Surprise Advent!

00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:26.116
Well, we kind of surprised you with super silly event!

00:16:26.136 --> 00:16:28.481
Yeah, special April Fool's Advent!

00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:33.590
We might have got into some trouble with, you know, crazy energy drink.

00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:34.392
Energy drink?

00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:36.075
What kind of drink was it?

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:36.756
Fire, fire.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:53.764
Thank you Ruffians for joining Shiori and Nerissa and Biboo.

00:16:53.784 --> 00:16:59.233
Unfortunately we couldn't participate this time.

00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:01.581
We are, you know, FUWAMOCO.

00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:04.331
We are really excited to be a part of this.

00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:11.637
Especially, you know, it's a very special night.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.181
Yeah, it's okay though.

00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:14.683
If you make a mistake, it's okay.

00:17:15.364 --> 00:17:19.169
But you know, this is extremely FUWAMOCO!

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.250
Yes, we're so excited!

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.854
We've been really looking forward to it for months, you know!

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:24.615
We're so cute!

00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:28.980
We're really looking forward to get excited, you know, to see everything!

00:17:29.641 --> 00:17:32.404
To see the Ruffians' reactions!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.768
So you know, we're really sorry that

00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:53.801
It didn't quite work out, but... But we wanted to say a big big thank you to Lulucano and all the creators for making an amazing, jaw-dropping, awesome video for a cover of I Don't Even Want to Say It.

00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:55.444
You are so good!

00:17:55.424 --> 00:17:58.570
You know, and all the creators, all the stars.

00:17:59.171 --> 00:18:02.537
Thank you so much!

00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:03.960
We love you so much!

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:04.861
It's amazing!

00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:08.368
Yeah, and the V.I.Chat world, and Super BAU FUWAMOCO!

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.351
Thank you!

00:18:10.371 --> 00:18:15.821
You know, as we got updates on the project, sometimes it would be really late at night.

00:18:16.623 --> 00:18:17.905
And you know, at 1.30,

00:18:19.049 --> 00:18:21.452
I think it was about 3 or 4 AM.

00:18:22.112 --> 00:18:27.518
And we were just cackling away!

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:29.821
You didn't go down too far!

00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:30.882
Are you kidding me?!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:34.185
I'm glad I laughed a lot!

00:18:34.206 --> 00:18:34.506
BAU BAU BAU!

00:18:34.526 --> 00:18:36.328
Were you hitting the desk, Ruffians?

00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:37.489
You too?

00:18:37.709 --> 00:18:38.010
Yeah.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:43.636
I feel like I need to, you know, FUWAMOCO Morning pause and go watch the video right now again.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:47.240
Again and again and again.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:47.520
So, Ruffians!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.022
Did you see that?

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:51.707
You need to go watch it again, okay?

00:18:52.928 --> 00:18:55.553
With FUWAMOCO, we did our best, you know.

00:18:55.633 --> 00:19:02.203
Singing as strong as we could with every ounce of FUFUFUZ that we had.

00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:04.767
It's a little...

00:19:05.287 --> 00:19:08.652
You are not a chihuahua, I'm a Ruffian.

00:19:08.672 --> 00:19:12.357
So we've sung Aya Torimodose before, okay?

00:19:12.757 --> 00:19:13.558
It's a fun song!

00:19:13.578 --> 00:19:15.481
We've sung it for Rock n' Rawr Party, right?

00:19:16.442 --> 00:19:17.384
Right?

00:19:17.404 --> 00:19:18.385
Have we?

00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:19.407
Tough boy we've sung.

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:21.469
We are living.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.672
Living into ages.

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:24.714
We've sung Aya Torimodose before.

00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:26.496
Not sure.

00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:26.717
Maybe.

00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:27.358
I don't know.

00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:27.618
Maybe.

00:19:27.638 --> 00:19:29.360
Just tough boy.

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.583
Okay, but Aya Torimodose was gonna happen.

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:32.905
This time.

00:19:33.947 --> 00:19:34.888
We sung it different.

00:19:35.695 --> 00:19:37.959
Yeah, we were like, okay, I'm gonna sing it like this.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.966
And then... It didn't end up that way.

00:19:42.987 --> 00:19:43.147
Yeah.

00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:44.729
Yeah.

00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:49.897
So it's a little bit more... Beastly standing.

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:51.139
Yeah.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.622
Demon dog.

00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:53.183
Yeah.

00:19:53.964 --> 00:19:55.687
Maybe not the most flattering.

00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:57.429
Entire soul.

00:19:57.509 --> 00:19:59.733
It felt like more muscle than entire soul.

00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:02.918
Yeah, all the muscles are flexed.

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:08.345
I hope that you listen to it lots.

00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:10.427
Listen to all of the Advent.

00:20:11.308 --> 00:20:14.192
Put everything into this color.

00:20:15.874 --> 00:20:19.799
And thank you again, Ruffians, for having a lot of fun today.

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:22.982
We're both together, and you know I'm the best at the fun.

00:20:23.383 --> 00:20:25.986
But if you haven't had enough fun yet,

00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:26.607
De-den!

00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:34.881
Well Ruffians, now you can dive right in because the VR chat world has been released!

00:20:35.342 --> 00:20:46.842
So gather some Ruffians, Monopolis, Pebbles, Geobullets, and we hope you have a lot of fun together in the VR chat world, okay?

00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:49.887
Go Ruffians, go!

00:20:49.907 --> 00:20:50.067
BAU BAU!

00:20:50.047 --> 00:20:52.090
Please check it out again!

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.353
Yeah, you can have a battle royale together.

00:20:55.054 --> 00:20:55.735
You know it!

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:56.917
There's lots of fun!

00:20:57.338 --> 00:20:58.940
More stuff to check out!

00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:00.663
Yeah.

00:21:00.683 --> 00:21:02.826
BAU BAU!

00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:05.129
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.054
And please check out the cover again, okay?

00:21:08.474 --> 00:21:13.642
BAU BAU!

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:17.107
And!

00:21:17.127 --> 00:21:17.368
Blazing Sun!

00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:17.969
It's Karin-senpai's birthday!

00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:18.589
Karin-senpai's happy birthday!

00:21:18.609 --> 00:21:18.990
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:27.423
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:27.664 --> 00:21:39.763
Have a howl of a day!

00:21:40.368 --> 00:21:54.867
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:57.692
9pm PT!

00:21:58.112 --> 00:22:01.599
There's going to be a brand new song being released!

00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:05.286
And the MV is animated by Calli-senpai herself!

00:22:05.747 --> 00:22:06.388
That's crazy!

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.940
And it seems like she maybe just finished it too, looking at her tweets!

00:22:13.578 --> 00:22:21.050
I'm super looking forward to it so let's please go cheer her on!

00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:22.452
I'm so excited!

00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:28.722
And Biboo and Shiori are guests too!

00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:31.827
But we wanted to say a big big happy birthday to Karin-senpai!

00:22:32.628 --> 00:22:38.758
You know, we're really really thankful to have such a special senpai that we can always count on.

00:22:38.738 --> 00:22:43.448
Listen to us and brighten up our world tonight.

00:22:43.468 --> 00:22:49.921
We're excited to watch you play!

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.925
Thank you!

00:22:51.945 --> 00:22:52.787
Tell me to have a howl of a day!

00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:53.288
Bye bye!

00:22:53.639 --> 00:23:04.457
Ruffians!

00:23:04.897 --> 00:23:10.146
You may be seeing some...

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:14.348
Interesting things floating around Twitter.

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:16.433
Adventures!

00:23:16.614 --> 00:23:17.877
FUWAMOCO!

00:23:17.977 --> 00:23:20.985
Looks like we might be going on some adventures!

00:23:21.426 --> 00:23:27.021
Because there's a fun FUWAMOCO adventure being in production.

00:23:27.001 --> 00:23:48.030
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:56.664
But, you know, it really reminds us of the games that we used to play together with Bubble Puppy!

00:23:56.684 --> 00:23:58.988
I wanna play together with Bubble Puppy!

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:00.911
Not with me.

00:24:00.931 --> 00:24:02.935
Not with Moco-chan.

00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:03.235
Me too.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:22.371
FUWAMOCO!

00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:27.682
But right now it seems like there's some pretty regular daily updates.

00:24:28.503 --> 00:24:31.249
And it's really interesting to see what's going on.

00:24:31.329 --> 00:24:35.978
So let's continue to cheer them on, not cheer them off again.

00:24:36.479 --> 00:24:38.704
Well, making a game isn't easy.

00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:41.570
But the number one thing is that one, right?

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.275
No pressure, no pressure ever.

00:24:44.255 --> 00:24:47.139
If it's done, it gets done.

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:49.302
If it doesn't get done, it doesn't get done.

00:24:50.042 --> 00:24:50.463
That's okay.

00:24:50.483 --> 00:24:52.305
Just have fun.

00:24:54.428 --> 00:24:55.049
BAU BAU!

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.093
Do your best!

00:24:58.213 --> 00:24:59.074
Much pressure.

00:24:59.094 --> 00:25:00.836
No pressure, Ruffians!

00:25:00.937 --> 00:25:02.218
I just want to cheer on.

00:25:02.238 --> 00:25:06.163
I want to cheer all of you on, okay?

00:25:06.624 --> 00:25:09.047
Just like you know, recently we were looking at

00:25:09.027 --> 00:25:12.993
You know all the special letters that you've wrote us, Ruffians?

00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:18.300
And you know the special treasures that we've gotten from the comic market.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.122
That's right.

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:31.199
We want to cheer on all the special things, your dreams, and everything to protect your smiles too, Ruffians!

00:25:33.002 --> 00:25:33.663
That's right.

00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:35.105
Yeah.

00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:35.225
Okay.

00:25:35.245 --> 00:25:35.405
BAU BAU!

00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:35.886
You wrote song letters!

00:25:35.906 --> 00:25:36.427
Song letters?

00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:37.448
We have a very special letter.

00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:45.154
Also in our hearts.

00:25:45.174 --> 00:25:45.795
BAU BAU!

00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:46.477
Ruffians!

00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:51.768
FUWAMOCO, we've had some special milestones recently!

00:25:52.088 --> 00:25:57.900
Wow, our newest song cover, Crescent Moon, has released!

00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:09.467
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:17.661
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:34.806
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:35.596 --> 00:26:44.027
Thank you, my favorite BAU BAU!

00:26:44.047 --> 00:26:44.247
Thank you!

00:26:44.267 --> 00:26:57.725
Also, just coincidentally, our song cover of White Love that we released back in 2023 has reached 1.5 million views!

00:26:58.406 --> 00:26:58.646
BAU BAU!

00:27:00.268 --> 00:27:01.871
What year is it?

00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:03.713
2025, Moco-chan!

00:27:05.633 --> 00:27:08.720
Are you sure that's right?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:08.880
Yeah.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.341
Was it?

00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:11.165
Yeah.

00:27:11.205 --> 00:27:11.706
2024?

00:27:12.508 --> 00:27:13.250
No.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:13.510
No?

00:27:13.992 --> 00:27:15.034
No.

00:27:15.054 --> 00:27:16.116
2023?

00:27:16.497 --> 00:27:16.878
Yeah.

00:27:16.898 --> 00:27:17.620
Okay, Ruffians.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.265
It was 2023!

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:20.386
Yeah!

00:27:21.047 --> 00:27:21.448
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:27:21.428 --> 00:27:23.250
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.711
Lots and lots of love.

00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:29.034
It's a cover of a legendary idol group's beat song.

00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:31.196
And it's a very emotional one too.

00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:33.999
It's a little bit different from present morning, you know?

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:37.441
It's a bit more of an upbeat, somewhat of a nostalgic feel too.

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:42.025
So... Please check it out if you haven't, okay?

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:43.266
FUWAMOCO Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:44.908
Look at you, you need to do it.

00:27:45.148 --> 00:27:47.009
I'll show you some more song covers.

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.910
Do more singing.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.552
Look forward to it.

00:27:49.572 --> 00:27:51.233
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:52.674
Hi!

00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:55.517
Wow, Moco-chan.

00:27:56.097 --> 00:27:58.860
It's been a week.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.621
Ruffians!

00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:01.402
How has it been for you?

00:28:02.924 --> 00:28:09.109
Because FUWAMOCO has been a week.

00:28:09.129 --> 00:28:12.012
It's been a bit rough.

00:28:12.032 --> 00:28:13.353
We've been a bit rough.

00:28:13.373 --> 00:28:13.694
Painful.

00:28:13.714 --> 00:28:14.114
It's been difficult.

00:28:14.134 --> 00:28:15.775
Oh, what was it please?

00:28:15.795 --> 00:28:16.436
You've been sick.

00:28:17.597 --> 00:28:18.638
You missed us.

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:24.895
Moco-chan, do you have anything to make me feel better?

00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:33.408
I can't promise anything, okay?

00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:43.663
But... I'll do my best!

00:28:43.683 --> 00:28:44.484
BAU BAU!

00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:44.685
Ruffians!

00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:50.093
It's that time again!

00:28:51.372 --> 00:28:56.843
It's not that time of week, but it is now!

00:28:57.284 --> 00:28:58.787
Because I say it is!

00:28:59.588 --> 00:29:02.955
It's time for a FUWAMOCO Code Pup Talk!

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:04.257
And you're gonna hear it from me!

00:29:04.638 --> 00:29:06.522
That's straight from me!

00:29:07.243 --> 00:29:07.424
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.011
Ruffians!

00:29:12.053 --> 00:29:13.195
I know.

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:17.124
Sometimes things just don't go how you planned it.

00:29:18.126 --> 00:29:19.989
No matter how much you prepare.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.273
No matter how excited you are.

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:23.576
Everything.

00:29:24.738 --> 00:29:28.264
Sometimes things just get in your way and it doesn't work out.

00:29:28.902 --> 00:29:30.884
I can feel like it's hard to overcome it.

00:29:31.825 --> 00:29:33.086
But you can do it!

00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:34.447
You're strong!

00:29:34.828 --> 00:29:35.328
Okay!

00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:40.833
So, let's do our best to try to expect the unexpected situations that come our way.

00:29:41.374 --> 00:29:47.380
But, ultimately, the most important thing with times like that is how we deal with it.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:47.820
You know?

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.285
So, sometimes, you can only do your best, and it's not anyone's fault.

00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:54.927
It's just too bad.

00:29:56.442 --> 00:29:59.488
So, let's keep on moving ahead, okay?

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.277
And remember, be kind to yourself!

00:30:04.297 --> 00:30:05.279
I believe in ya!

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.083

Do you hear me?

00:30:30.946 --> 00:30:31.487
I believe in you Moco-chan!

00:30:31.507 --> 00:30:31.867

00:30:32.889 --> 00:30:32.929
Do

00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:35.492
There's a cute Doggie of the Day waiting for us.

00:30:35.512 --> 00:30:35.712
Maybe.

00:30:36.152 --> 00:30:38.575
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day.

00:30:39.035 --> 00:30:43.640
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.503
A doggy with no name.

00:30:46.523 --> 00:30:47.844
Doesn't have a name, Moco-chan.

00:30:48.185 --> 00:30:49.666
What's your doggy's name?

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:52.509
What's your doggy's name, huh?

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.330
BAU BAU!

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.032
We're gonna have to give him a name, huh?

00:30:55.052 --> 00:30:55.412
Guess so.

00:30:56.193 --> 00:30:57.094
What's the name?

00:30:57.952 --> 00:30:58.593
Okay.

3, 2, 1.

00:31:01.016 --> 00:31:09.025
The Doggie of the Day is Mr. I don't know if it's a Mr. Mr. Lawyer!

00:31:09.446 --> 00:31:11.048
Mr. Lawyer!

00:31:11.088 --> 00:31:11.589
Cheddar!

00:31:11.609 --> 00:31:14.492
Mr. Lawyer Cheddar.

00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:16.074
Mr. Cheddar the lawyer.

00:31:16.094 --> 00:31:18.737
Mr. Cheddar the lawyer is his full name.

00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:19.538
Yes.

00:31:19.558 --> 00:31:21.280
Nickname is Cheese.

00:31:23.143 --> 00:31:24.645
It's not exact FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:25.866
Yes.

00:31:25.846 --> 00:31:28.150
Mr. Cheddar the lawyer nicknamed Cheese.

00:31:29.191 --> 00:31:32.477
That's the Doggie of the Day!

00:31:35.682 --> 00:31:44.817
Well, Mr. Cheddar... I'm sorry, I will correct myself.

00:31:46.754 --> 00:31:47.896
Mr. Chatter the Lawyer?

00:31:49.018 --> 00:31:51.181
That was it!

00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:53.445
Mr. Chatter the Lawyer.

00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:54.126
Nickname Cheese.

00:31:54.827 --> 00:31:56.149
Wasabi.

00:31:56.169 --> 00:32:01.638
But it's okay, you know, because just the presence of Hoshifuwamoco.

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:06.446
His name is Duke.

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:06.647
Duke.

00:32:06.667 --> 00:32:07.047
Duke.

00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:08.870
Mr. Chatter the Lawyer.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.515
Nickname Cheese.

00:32:11.635 --> 00:32:13.538
Also known as Duke.

00:32:15.374 --> 00:32:15.775
Yes!

00:32:16.496 --> 00:32:17.238
I know!

00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:20.384
Everything's changed because FUWAMOCO!

00:32:20.704 --> 00:32:23.409
We're down, we're plushy, we're fluffy, and we're fuzzy!

00:32:23.449 --> 00:32:26.736
That's the most important thing.

00:32:27.497 --> 00:32:27.818
Yes!

00:32:30.363 --> 00:32:30.804
Yes!

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.210
I know, but...

00:32:35.523 --> 00:32:38.168
Moco-chan!

00:32:39.371 --> 00:32:46.224
How does Mr. China the lawyer nickname cheese also known as Duke BAU BAU?

00:32:50.252 --> 00:32:52.857

00:32:52.877 --> 00:32:53.338

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:54.460

00:32:55.469 --> 00:33:05.905
I can feel the hope radiating from him.

00:33:06.466 --> 00:33:14.638
Mr. Chatter the Lawyer nicknamed Cheese also known as Duke is a very good boy.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:21.108
He likes to enjoy his Ruffian's favorite thing together with her.

00:33:21.128 --> 00:33:22.751
He loves this Ruffian.

00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:24.413
And you know,

00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:27.519
That's a feeling that we all share.

00:33:29.462 --> 00:33:30.383
Remember, Ruffians!

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:34.168
Remember, your FUWAMOCO plushies keep us close to you.

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:36.772
Especially, you know, when you're feeling a bit cloudy.

00:33:37.233 --> 00:33:38.995
Or cold.

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:41.659
Yeah.

00:33:56.352 --> 00:33:56.552
BAU BAU!

00:33:56.793 --> 00:33:59.316
Well, it's spring now, Ruffians.

00:33:59.336 --> 00:34:00.798
You cannot stay indoors.

00:34:01.218 --> 00:34:02.700
You cannot be like, it's cold.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.102
It's spring now.

00:34:04.122 --> 00:34:06.384
It might be cold, but it's spring, so you have to go inside.

00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:09.889
So let's take a look on where you've been on a walk.

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:12.071
Today, I went on a walk.

00:34:12.452 --> 00:34:16.617
We have... De-den!

00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:19.240
This is a cool forest.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.102
The trees look so cool.

00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:22.424
Oh!

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:26.990
You're out exploring different places in Japan.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.710
Fukuoka!

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:27.891
Fukuoka!

00:34:27.911 --> 00:34:29.793
That's quite a bit further.

00:34:31.575 --> 00:34:31.695
Wow.

00:34:31.715 --> 00:34:32.576
You know my super idol.

00:34:33.097 --> 00:34:35.880
Really unique for how the trees are so thin.

00:34:36.661 --> 00:34:38.223
Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:39.665
But they all want their own space.

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:42.068
But they're not gonna have too many leaves.

00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:44.571
I like the ground.

00:34:45.472 --> 00:34:46.153
They do.

00:34:47.695 --> 00:34:47.775
Wow.

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:54.500
Being watched can help with feeling.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.661
Tree is curvy.

00:34:56.943 --> 00:34:59.006
Why are you looking at the tree like that, huh?

00:34:59.726 --> 00:35:07.035
There's something that's more than a tree there, Moco-chan.

00:35:07.055 --> 00:35:08.797
Are you using your imagination?

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.424
Just trees.

00:35:14.444 --> 00:35:14.604
BAU BAU!

00:35:14.624 --> 00:35:16.767
Don't mind anything weird, okay, Ruffians?

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.182
BAU BAU!

00:35:22.583 --> 00:35:25.066
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:29.650
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:40.362
Now that your voyager has even more options available before going live, how exactly do each of you decide what you want to wear?

00:35:40.382 --> 00:35:43.605
Like, is today's stream more of a glasses occasion?

00:35:44.105 --> 00:35:48.610
Or this game looks chilly so it'd be a good idea to bundle up?

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.734
I love this!

00:35:52.497 --> 00:35:53.478
This!

00:35:53.498 --> 00:35:57.064
We don't know anything!

00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:57.445
We don't know!

00:35:57.465 --> 00:36:01.993
You know, we've been wearing our out-of-the-boat outfits a lot recently.

00:36:02.013 --> 00:36:09.626
But, we're kind of in a bit of a... When do we go back?

00:36:09.806 --> 00:36:09.906
Yeah.

00:36:10.308 --> 00:36:14.415
You know, it's not just a, wait, how am I going to do my hair today?

00:36:14.455 --> 00:36:16.158
Do I want glasses or not?

00:36:16.178 --> 00:36:19.845
It's a, when, when, when should I wear what?

00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:24.673
I, you know, I, my usual clothes are pretty comfy too.

00:36:26.196 --> 00:36:29.582
When an occasion calls for it, when you feel like it.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.383
You know, it's time for our New Year's Office!

00:36:35.024 --> 00:36:41.631
Once it's not New Year's anymore, maybe it's not really a celebratory time, then, you know, it's time to put it away.

00:36:42.372 --> 00:36:46.637
But, now we're not really sure what to do here.

00:36:46.657 --> 00:36:50.401
And I feel like even for the New Year's Office, isn't that a shame?

00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:51.982
It's a shame, they're so pretty!

00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:54.145
So then when?

00:36:54.966 --> 00:36:55.266
Yeah.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.462
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:36:58.204 --> 00:37:05.838
I think we do kinda think maybe what humor or maybe what fits what we're about to do and try to match that.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.989
But... We're not sure if we're making the right decisions.

00:37:13.032 --> 00:37:18.258
Yeah, maybe Ruffians you could let us know like you want to see more of and your thoughts too.

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:19.520
Yeah!

00:37:21.502 --> 00:37:21.943
Yeah!

00:37:21.963 --> 00:37:23.024
Any choice is good.

00:37:23.064 --> 00:37:26.288
Maybe there's a Donkey Kong kind of outfit.

00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:27.209
What?

00:37:28.391 --> 00:37:30.293
Donkey Kong?

00:37:30.313 --> 00:37:31.795
Donkey Kong kind of outfit?

00:37:32.195 --> 00:37:35.780
What's a Donkey Kong kind of outfit to you Ruffians?

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.181
Twin tails more Donkey Kong.

00:37:37.702 --> 00:37:39.864
Grab onto the twin tails.

00:37:40.205 --> 00:37:40.305
What?

00:37:45.888 --> 00:37:54.598
New Year's for Donkey Kong!

00:37:55.827 --> 00:37:56.528
Oh!

00:37:57.148 --> 00:37:59.150
Glad to see what it is done, Ruffians!

00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:01.052
Maybe you'll be surprised.

00:38:02.394 --> 00:38:05.217
BAU BAU!

00:38:05.237 --> 00:38:09.942
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions to FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.964
Ruffians, remember!

00:38:11.984 --> 00:38:15.808
You are a very important part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:16.288 --> 00:38:22.755
So we're always looking for more of your submissions with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:38:22.855 --> 00:38:25.378
It's all the other days, your vlogs, it's springtime,

00:38:25.358 --> 00:38:26.862
Don't forget!

00:38:26.882 --> 00:38:28.044
Reporting questions!

00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:32.355
We're getting lots of great questions recently, but send us more questions, Ruffians!

00:38:32.876 --> 00:38:36.143
And Pero Sightings too, you know!

00:38:36.404 --> 00:38:36.665
Don't forget.

00:38:36.845 --> 00:38:40.273
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:38:40.293 --> 00:38:41.316
Thank you!

00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:41.496
BAU BAU!

00:38:41.516 --> 00:38:42.338
Don't forget to use the hashtag.

00:38:42.318 --> 00:38:43.339
Okay.

00:38:43.419 --> 00:38:44.901
Hashtag important.

00:38:45.062 --> 00:38:45.843
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:38:46.483 --> 00:38:48.906
BAU BAU!

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:51.310
And for our next stream!

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.050
Wow!

00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:54.293
We kind of just talked about it, but!

00:38:55.054 --> 00:38:57.978
De-den!

00:38:57.998 --> 00:38:59.039
And 6pm PT!

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.585
We're going to be continuing our adventure in Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:39:03.605 --> 00:39:04.246
Yes!

00:39:04.747 --> 00:39:05.768
Business!

00:39:05.788 --> 00:39:07.330
Moco-chan, how is it going?

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:15.906
It has been running this entire time we've been playing Donkey Kong Country 2, which is kind of amazing because I felt like we just played it last month.

00:39:16.327 --> 00:39:19.273
Yep, last month was apparently October.

00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:22.699
But this nest has still been on!

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.142
It is still doing great!

00:39:24.202 --> 00:39:25.605
The controller fell on the ground.

00:39:26.429 --> 00:39:30.153
So we will share what it has been on the whole time.

00:39:30.873 --> 00:39:33.736
Yeah, we kinda surprised the class.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:35.057
Why is it like this?

00:39:35.077 --> 00:39:35.698
Why is it here?

00:39:36.318 --> 00:39:37.159
Yeah.

00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:40.462
So we'll share it in memory of you four kids!

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:40.803
Doggy Pack!

00:39:41.123 --> 00:39:42.464
BAU BAU!

00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:44.246
But, please join us, Ruffians!

00:39:44.306 --> 00:39:47.369
We're gonna be going bananas just like usual.

00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:52.033
BAU BAU!

00:39:52.213 --> 00:39:54.696
And we'll take a peek at our schedule!

00:39:54.816 --> 00:39:55.997
Well, we have also

00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.820
We're gonna be revisiting a little bit.

00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:01.587
How's that going Moco-chan?

00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:03.770
We had some issues with our data.

00:40:04.351 --> 00:40:06.896
Not going yet.

00:40:06.916 --> 00:40:10.582
I'm sure Moco-chan will be able to get right back where we were very soon.

00:40:11.243 --> 00:40:12.906
And you'll be a pro, right?

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:26.070
And on Sunday, very early in the morning at 4am PT, we're gonna be having an off-collab!

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.535
On ???'s channel!

00:40:28.555 --> 00:40:31.241
A ??? off-collab!

00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:32.464
What could that be?

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:36.404
Who are we collabing with?

00:40:36.745 --> 00:40:38.508
Who aren't we collabing with?

00:40:38.568 --> 00:40:39.289
Who could it be?

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.494
Very secretive.

00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:47.262
You have to find out who it is!

00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:48.824
It's up to the senpai.

00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:51.769
We don't call the shots.

00:40:53.302 --> 00:41:01.110
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:06.396

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:21.274
But YouTube will be correct.

00:41:21.494 --> 00:41:26.701
When we put up the waiting room for it, it will be at the correct time, okay?

00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:33.969
I know it's a couple times, but whatever.

00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:37.534
It's not a mistake.

00:41:37.854 --> 00:41:38.094
BAU BAU!

00:41:38.114 --> 00:41:38.875
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:40.678
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.440
I'm forgetting something important!

00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.402
Ruffians!

00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:49.281

00:42:03.822 --> 00:42:05.284
Not yet.

00:42:05.304 --> 00:42:05.384
Huh?

00:42:06.165 --> 00:42:09.450
We haven't played Mohan yet.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.852
There's a lot of games we haven't played that we really wanna play.

00:42:10.912 --> 00:42:12.955
Yeah, now the Switch 2 is coming out, right?

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:18.257
That's okay, I'll just play games on my snacks.

00:42:18.277 --> 00:42:19.700
How many game consoles have been out?

00:42:21.303 --> 00:42:22.384
There's so many games for all the consoles!

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:28.315
We're going at a deep and dark pace, okay Ruffians?

00:42:28.335 --> 00:42:28.616
Yes.

00:42:29.457 --> 00:42:31.822
Yes.

00:42:32.202 --> 00:42:33.284
Enjoy FUWAMOCO!

00:42:33.304 --> 00:42:35.348
I had a dream about playing that.

00:42:41.723 --> 00:42:46.992
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:42:50.718 --> 00:42:55.245
