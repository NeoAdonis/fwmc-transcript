05:09.134 --> 05:11.115

05:19.281 --> 05:19.821

05:21.049 --> 05:24.692
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:25.292 --> 05:27.914
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.954 --> 05:29.956
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.016 --> 05:32.998
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:33.518 --> 05:37.802
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.282 --> 05:39.383
Ruffians!

05:39.843 --> 05:44.667
Thank you for waking up for us and joining us today for our 103rd episode!

05:44.687 --> 05:45.027
BAU BAU!

05:45.067 --> 05:48.990
Everything is normal.

05:55.615 --> 05:58.736
You just got up, but you just got up, okay?

05:58.797 --> 06:00.558
That's amazing.

06:01.138 --> 06:06.581
But it's not normal because today's gonna be a good day that starts off on the right paw.

06:06.601 --> 06:09.323
I hope every day is a good day that starts off on the right paw.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.565
But it's gonna be an extra special one.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.106
Extra special normal day!

06:14.126 --> 06:14.266
BAU BAU!

06:18.428 --> 06:22.129
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:22.289 --> 06:24.210
I see a lot of new Ruffians.

06:24.290 --> 06:33.512
I think maybe some will join us from... Five Nights at Freddy's!

06:33.532 --> 06:34.112
Is that it?

06:34.192 --> 06:35.372
Five Nights at Freddy's?

06:35.693 --> 06:37.053
From BAU BAU?

06:38.496 --> 06:40.437
From Five Nights at Freddy's.

06:40.657 --> 06:41.357
Did we say it?

06:42.397 --> 06:42.678
Yeah!

06:42.878 --> 06:43.358
BAU BAU!

06:43.538 --> 06:45.919
BAU BAU!

06:46.259 --> 06:49.680
It's about FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:49.760 --> 06:51.401
No, it's your first time joining us.

06:51.681 --> 06:54.722
It wouldn't be good if you're confused right off the morning.

06:54.742 --> 07:02.225
Yeah, well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

07:02.485 --> 07:03.145
A.K.A.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.126
FUWAMOCO!

07:04.146 --> 07:05.266
Hosted by us!

07:05.786 --> 07:07.107
FUWAMOCO!

07:08.247 --> 07:13.350
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.250
I'm sorry I'm busy laughing here.

07:15.551 --> 07:17.091
Why are you laughing, Moco-chan?

07:17.411 --> 07:18.712
I'm used off the morning.

07:18.732 --> 07:20.893
What does that mean?

07:21.353 --> 07:27.356
But, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:27.716 --> 07:31.918
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:32.338 --> 07:34.279
BAU BAU!

07:36.240 --> 07:38.822
Ah, we skipped natto one day!

07:38.842 --> 07:39.903
That's fine.

07:40.223 --> 07:41.104
No one will cry.

07:41.184 --> 07:43.325
No one will cry, Ruffians.

07:43.345 --> 07:45.026
Ruffians, you could've cried, right?

07:45.086 --> 07:45.607
Did we?

07:45.687 --> 07:47.908
Moco-chan, the Ruffians are crying!

07:47.988 --> 07:49.849
Did we skip natto one day?

07:49.889 --> 07:50.290
Really?

07:50.310 --> 07:53.752
You see the natto coming out of their eyes right now!

07:53.772 --> 07:54.693
That's not healthy.

07:54.733 --> 07:57.955
Maybe you should go to the doctor, huh?

07:58.455 --> 07:58.815
Huh?

07:58.915 --> 08:00.817
BAU BAU!

08:01.577 --> 08:02.198
BAU BAU!

08:02.238 --> 08:03.819
You're happy for Moco-chan.

08:04.179 --> 08:04.579
Thank you.

08:06.959 --> 08:15.106
Well, it's gonna be a good Wednesday, a good middle of the week.

08:15.887 --> 08:16.668
Moco-chan.

08:17.588 --> 08:18.769
Why are you making that noise?

08:18.789 --> 08:20.130
It's up for this.

08:21.932 --> 08:24.014
There's been another Pero Sighting!

08:27.505 --> 08:28.086
I don't know.

08:28.826 --> 08:31.049
Every time it's a bit of a downer.

08:31.509 --> 08:34.712
But, maybe it's better to get the downers out of the way first.

08:34.772 --> 08:37.235
I feel like Pero's been kinda nice recently, you know?

08:37.335 --> 08:38.996
Not really getting in our way.

08:39.136 --> 08:40.538
Doing some nice things.

08:40.698 --> 08:41.158
Right!

08:42.059 --> 08:43.381
Ruffians, don't we like Pero?

08:43.401 --> 08:44.822
Wait, I don't know.

08:45.182 --> 08:46.384
Let's see, Ruffians.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.005
You say that right now, but...

08:49.355 --> 08:52.557
De-den!

08:52.857 --> 08:56.840
These are the Warehouse Cards!

08:56.860 --> 09:02.364
I have the Super Expo 2020 movie footage!

09:02.444 --> 09:05.106
I'm really glad that you found some!

09:05.186 --> 09:05.807
It's nice, huh?

09:05.827 --> 09:06.227
Yeah!

09:06.347 --> 09:08.989
And you got our lovely senpai!

09:09.129 --> 09:09.769
And Shiori!

09:09.809 --> 09:13.212
You can't see her here, but... And me!

09:13.232 --> 09:13.552
BAU BAU!

09:13.572 --> 09:13.672
But...

09:18.450 --> 09:21.491
It also looks like you got pero.

09:25.692 --> 09:29.633
But maybe... Is this Ruffian doesn't seem to mind?

09:29.653 --> 09:31.953
Are you sure?

09:31.973 --> 09:33.173
Are you sure?

09:33.193 --> 09:37.694
You didn't feel like, ah, this is awful.

09:38.395 --> 09:41.335
Anyone else would have been better, right?

09:42.216 --> 09:42.596
Really?

09:42.616 --> 09:43.856
Really, really?

09:45.358 --> 09:47.979
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

10:15.270 --> 10:23.116
What about Mococo?

10:23.156 --> 10:28.739
What about Nerissa, ha, Moco-chan?

10:28.859 --> 10:31.621
Here's a bonerissa.

10:31.701 --> 10:32.662
I can't bonerissa.

10:44.868 --> 10:45.669
Wow.

10:46.309 --> 10:48.851
We're glad that you had amazing gacha luck.

10:48.891 --> 10:50.713
No, Moco-chan, but Pero, I guess that's okay.

10:51.093 --> 10:54.196
And we hope it continues forever and ever, right?

10:55.677 --> 10:56.418
Right, Moco-chan?

10:58.460 --> 10:58.800
Okay.

10:59.140 --> 11:02.743
Yeah, because that means that this Mofi will then get Moco-chan, too!

11:02.763 --> 11:04.124
That's what I was thinking.

11:04.144 --> 11:04.485
Yeah.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.347
BAU BAU!

11:07.367 --> 11:08.768
I guess it's good that you got Pero.

11:08.808 --> 11:09.589
That makes you happy.

11:09.649 --> 11:11.210
BAU BAU.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.471
Forget Nerissa.

11:12.511 --> 11:12.732
BAU BAU!

11:17.791 --> 11:19.392
Well, Ruffians!

11:21.454 --> 11:28.502
We might kind of have a bit of an apology to make.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.807
Ruffians, we're really, really sorry.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.894
Did you know?

11:37.914 --> 11:38.815
Did you notice?

11:38.875 --> 11:49.161
Maybe there's some Ruffians here that didn't notice, but actually, for the first time ever ever, we had to cancel a FUWAMOCO Morning.

11:49.581 --> 11:50.942
And very suddenly too.

11:50.982 --> 11:51.822
Very suddenly.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.443
Up until now, you know.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.884
A couple hours beforehand.

11:54.904 --> 11:56.105
A few hours, yeah.

11:56.405 --> 12:01.808
But up until now, you know, every single FUWAMOCO Morning, every single one since we debuted,

12:02.288 --> 12:05.930
Every single one has happened until now.

12:06.011 --> 12:08.752
No oversleeping, no sickness.

12:09.373 --> 12:11.974
Every single one.

12:12.014 --> 12:13.355
We power through them all.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.936
But on Monday, we had to cancel.

12:21.244 --> 12:25.086
Ruffians, there was a really, really good reason though.

12:25.526 --> 12:28.748
So uh, thank you for understanding!

12:28.868 --> 12:29.569
Yeah!

12:29.669 --> 12:30.309
Yeah!

12:30.769 --> 12:31.910
You see!

12:32.230 --> 12:33.771
Wow, FUWAMOCO!

12:33.791 --> 12:37.173
It was a really crazy intense day!

12:37.193 --> 12:37.693
Crazy!

12:37.733 --> 12:38.754
FUWAMOCO!

12:39.054 --> 12:41.695
We have been up from early, early morning!

12:41.715 --> 12:42.796
Really, really early.

12:42.816 --> 12:42.956
Yeah.

12:43.176 --> 12:46.058
Until late night working so hard!

12:46.138 --> 12:47.078
Like dogs!

12:47.198 --> 12:47.899
Like dogs!

12:47.939 --> 12:49.860
Like dogs and dogs and dogs.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.123
We're working hard all together with all of Advent too!

13:09.033 --> 13:15.438
Despite being super tired puppies, you know, we're like, okay, yep, we're going to do a FUWAMOCO Morning.

13:15.558 --> 13:16.058
Of course!

13:16.138 --> 13:19.721
As always, you know, because we wanted to make sure to start the week off.

13:19.741 --> 13:20.762
That's what we had planned.

13:20.782 --> 13:22.723
Yeah, on the right paw together with you.

13:22.763 --> 13:25.665
That's what we had planned.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.667
You know, we even haven't had dinner.

13:27.687 --> 13:28.147
Yeah.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.250
And Nerissa and Biboo are gonna go out to get something yummy.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.951
And we said no.

13:33.743 --> 13:38.409
Like we've done many times before, you know.

13:39.370 --> 13:42.113
We have an important engagement with the Ruffians, right?

13:42.193 --> 13:43.455
But then... Actually...

13:48.828 --> 13:50.811
Suisei-senpai came in!

13:50.911 --> 13:54.415
BAU BAU!

13:54.575 --> 13:59.642
Those Suisei-senpais came in like a comet!

13:59.662 --> 14:00.323
Like a comet!

14:01.124 --> 14:05.730
And it was our first time meeting Suisei-senpai and we were so surprised!

14:10.087 --> 14:10.807
Yeah.

14:11.547 --> 14:18.209
Suisei-senpai, she asked what our plans were because our busy day was now over.

14:18.329 --> 14:18.769
Yeah.

14:19.209 --> 14:21.869
And we said, you know, we have FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

14:22.189 --> 14:24.250
You know, that's what we have planned.

14:24.610 --> 14:26.150
That's what we are gonna do.

14:26.550 --> 14:32.992
But then she was like, oh, FUWAMOCO, you'll come to Yakiniku with all of us, right?

14:33.252 --> 14:33.912
Right.

14:34.912 --> 14:38.376
And Ruffians... We knew what we had to do.

14:39.657 --> 14:48.286
You know, because if THE Suisei Senpai... THE Suisei Senpai... If she asks you to dinner, what do you say, Ruffians?

14:49.587 --> 14:51.669
Are you gonna ignore a comment?

14:51.689 --> 14:52.770
You can't do that.

14:53.091 --> 14:53.351
Huh?

14:53.771 --> 14:54.092
Yeah.

14:55.319 --> 14:55.740
Yes.

14:56.380 --> 14:56.801
Yes.

14:56.861 --> 14:57.141
Yes.

15:12.058 --> 15:18.821
Yeah, we're so excited, so nervous, but really, really, really happy to have dinner with her, you know.

15:19.082 --> 15:19.322
Yeah!

15:19.342 --> 15:23.484
FUWAMOCO, we really respect and admire Senpai so much.

15:23.584 --> 15:24.064
Of course.

15:24.164 --> 15:30.727
And we're really happy to be able to have the opportunity to ask her a bunch of questions!

15:30.747 --> 15:33.309
So many questions, always!

15:33.689 --> 15:36.010
We got a lot of Senpai power from her.

15:37.671 --> 15:43.294
I was sitting directly across from Suisei-senpai!

15:43.755 --> 15:52.720
And every time she cooked a piece of meat for me and put it on my plate, I felt like I was gonna cry, Ruffians!

15:52.740 --> 15:56.743
You were crying, right?

15:56.783 --> 15:58.664
Suisei-senpai BAU BAU!

15:58.964 --> 16:00.165
This isn't the time for that!

16:02.646 --> 16:07.489
FUWAMOCO, maybe we're not the best at yakiniku.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.131
We're probably not the best people to invite to yakiniku.

16:11.011 --> 16:11.632
Because I...

16:12.935 --> 16:13.675
We scream.

16:14.735 --> 16:16.776
We're babies when it comes to yakiniku.

16:16.796 --> 16:18.196
We don't know what to do.

16:18.596 --> 16:20.056
And the fire is scary.

16:22.177 --> 16:24.337
So we scream and we can't control ourselves.

16:24.857 --> 16:26.858
Suisei-senpai was laughing at us.

16:29.998 --> 16:33.939
It's not like we were forced to go to dinner with Dai-senpai.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.340
We wanted to go, you know?

16:37.560 --> 16:37.960
Of course.

16:38.462 --> 16:38.802
Hi.

16:39.142 --> 16:48.427
And you know, it's not like there's ever gonna be another chance when we can go out to dinner with Nerissa and Biboo and Suisei-senpai!

16:48.467 --> 16:48.827
Yeah.

16:48.847 --> 16:49.827
It's very slim.

16:49.887 --> 16:50.888
Yeah.

16:51.128 --> 16:52.088
It felt like a dream.

16:52.329 --> 16:55.090
Yeah, and we wanted to take the opportunity too!

16:55.190 --> 16:55.370
Yeah!

16:55.570 --> 16:59.612
You know, cause Suisei-senpai is very, very pretty too, right?

16:59.632 --> 16:59.812
Yeah.

16:59.932 --> 17:01.713
We hope you understand, Ruffians!

17:02.173 --> 17:04.874
You know, it wasn't a decision that we made lightly.

17:04.894 --> 17:04.934
No.

17:04.954 --> 17:05.335
Uh-uh.

17:05.375 --> 17:05.495
No.

17:06.880 --> 17:14.968
Yeah, but we were just, we were really really happy because we were able to share with Suisei-senpai just how hungry we were!

17:15.028 --> 17:17.230
But, but, not in the yakiniku way.

17:17.631 --> 17:19.432
In the ambitious sort of way.

17:19.512 --> 17:20.393
Ambitious way.

17:20.413 --> 17:22.595
Yeah, but we weren't hungry afterwards.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.537
We were, no, we were done.

17:26.037 --> 17:31.259
But Suisei-senpai also said that she'll be cheering us on too!

17:31.439 --> 17:33.680
And you know what?

17:33.700 --> 17:37.542
Nerissa and Biboo and I were actually laughing to each other.

17:37.962 --> 17:48.687
Because when we were walking back, Fuwawa and Suisei-senpai were walking together, and Nerissa was like, oh, it looks like they're on a date together, huh?

17:53.662 --> 17:57.804
I was trying to be the coolest demon dog I could be a Ruffian.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.586
Although I wasn't looking very cool at the time.

18:01.626 --> 18:04.007
You're probably looking like a big ball of mess.

18:04.307 --> 18:06.148
I'm very sweaty.

18:06.508 --> 18:09.970
Comments are hot, yo.

18:10.050 --> 18:16.253
Thank you Suisei-senpai for treating us to delicious yakiniku!

18:16.653 --> 18:20.175
And for giving us lots of amazing advice and support!

18:20.775 --> 18:22.096
Thank you!

18:22.256 --> 18:23.817
Arigatou!

18:24.077 --> 18:32.843
That one day, maybe FUWAMOCO, we can become amazing members of hololive just like our Suisei-senpai is too.

18:33.383 --> 18:35.905
BAU BAU!

18:36.045 --> 18:37.166
Ruffians!

18:37.726 --> 18:38.546
You understand?

18:40.928 --> 18:41.528
Understandable.

18:42.709 --> 18:43.329
Understandable?

18:43.370 --> 18:44.470
BAU BAU!

18:49.690 --> 19:03.317
Speaking of dreams, over the weekend I had a really funny dream that there was a new generation of hololive English called Justice that debuted!

19:15.829 --> 19:19.091
I think there was... It wasn't a dream, Moco-chan!

19:19.232 --> 19:21.693
I think there was... Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

19:22.134 --> 19:24.515
Yeah, over the weekend!

19:24.576 --> 19:27.077
The newest generation of hololive English!

19:27.498 --> 19:28.739
Justice!

19:28.799 --> 19:30.240
Made their debut!

19:30.300 --> 19:34.923
We have Bijou and Senpai!

19:34.983 --> 19:36.224
Crazy dream, right?

19:36.244 --> 19:42.609
It was so, so nice to see them debut and get cool!

19:44.250 --> 19:46.891
The love to be held now and then!

19:46.931 --> 19:48.811
Then Cecelia!

19:48.871 --> 19:50.971
And then Elizabeth Rose Bluffling!

19:51.331 --> 19:55.052
And then Gigi!

19:55.132 --> 20:00.213
It was nice that, you know, all of Advent, we were able to do a off-cloud watch-a-wee-ya!

20:00.253 --> 20:03.754
And I gave you those from the studio!

20:03.834 --> 20:06.054
And it was really, it was just so nice.

20:06.134 --> 20:08.255
It was really cute to see them do their best.

20:08.815 --> 20:11.136
Debuting, remembering, that was us not too long ago.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.376
Yeah, it made us all a bit nostalgic, huh?

20:13.596 --> 20:16.077
Yeah, this... This FUWAMOCO Senpai!

20:16.097 --> 20:17.397
Yeah, this FUWAMOCO!

20:17.457 --> 20:22.559
I was feeling like a... a very, uh... mature puppy at that moment.

20:22.939 --> 20:24.159
Yeah.

20:24.199 --> 20:24.900
You know?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.100
FUWAMOCO's right!

20:26.880 --> 20:29.401
It was just so much fun cheering them on!

20:29.421 --> 20:29.641
Yeah!

20:29.781 --> 20:33.402
But, uh... We're definitely not gonna let them catch us, you know?

20:33.702 --> 20:35.883
But, you know, it needs to be said!

20:36.163 --> 20:36.663
But, but...

20:37.243 --> 20:37.804
Yeah, just like that.

20:37.824 --> 20:37.944
Yeah.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.883
That's a senpai's job, right?

21:00.163 --> 21:04.265
Good senpai behavior!

21:05.086 --> 21:05.787
Exactly!

21:05.907 --> 21:09.189
They've already got to see so much of their personalities.

21:09.289 --> 21:09.429
Right?

21:09.549 --> 21:12.471
And they released an amazing original song too.

21:12.511 --> 21:15.693
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

21:19.135 --> 21:19.635
Yeah!

21:19.895 --> 21:23.437
And, you know, Elizabeth's already done a bunch of karaoke!

21:23.477 --> 21:23.937
Right!

21:24.157 --> 21:25.938
But, I was really curious!

21:26.158 --> 21:26.418
Huh?

21:26.538 --> 21:33.240
I wanna see, you know, I wanna see Elizabeth- She did a really good Alvin impersonation in BAU BAU.

21:33.660 --> 21:37.162
But, I haven't seen a Pero impersonation, right?

21:37.242 --> 21:37.982
We don't need that.

21:38.482 --> 21:39.242
He's nasty.

21:39.822 --> 21:43.724
I wanna see Elizabeth's Pero impersonation, right, Ruffians?

21:45.244 --> 21:45.644
Right!

21:46.665 --> 21:46.725
Hmm...

21:48.334 --> 21:49.515
Biboo did that!

21:50.376 --> 21:51.137
I wanna see.

21:51.297 --> 21:52.177
Biboo did that!

21:52.398 --> 21:55.460
Which one is it?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.121
Cecilia too, you know?

21:57.141 --> 21:59.283
We made plans to rip off her head, right?

21:59.343 --> 22:00.984
Yes, we did make plans for that.

22:01.004 --> 22:04.888
After we rip off her head... And I had to rub our fingers on her joints.

22:05.308 --> 22:06.129
That too, I guess.

22:07.530 --> 22:13.414
But you know, I thought it'd be fun that after we try ripping off her head, then we could drink tea together and see how that goes.

22:14.415 --> 22:14.856
Right!

22:15.296 --> 22:16.437
Where would it go, huh?

22:16.617 --> 22:17.999
I don't know, we have to see!

22:18.039 --> 22:18.800
We have to try!

22:18.840 --> 22:19.320
Right!

22:19.620 --> 22:22.163
Alright!

22:23.284 --> 22:25.066
I could try something, Moco-chan.

22:27.268 --> 22:29.931
Cecelia could take a drink from the tea.

22:30.651 --> 22:33.715
And then we could see if it falls out of the neck.

22:34.195 --> 22:35.917
Then maybe we could drink from that.

22:38.616 --> 22:39.719
Wait, Ruffians!

22:39.900 --> 22:41.003
It's an idea!

22:41.023 --> 22:41.645
Yeah!

22:41.926 --> 22:42.748
An idea!

22:42.768 --> 22:43.009
Right!

22:47.913 --> 22:52.016
FUWAMOCO It's an idea!

22:52.056 --> 22:52.637
Moco-chan.

23:15.695 --> 23:19.457
I don't know.

23:19.477 --> 23:19.577
Maybe.

23:21.579 --> 23:25.721
You know, you power up a bit if you got some of Gigi's grammar power.

23:26.522 --> 23:27.842
I wonder how I can do that.

23:27.882 --> 23:31.745
Maybe you could just take a finger off of her something.

23:32.045 --> 23:32.605
Just a bite.

23:33.146 --> 23:33.526
Yeah.

23:34.306 --> 23:35.467
BAU BAU!

23:35.507 --> 23:36.548
We're good senpai, right?

23:36.608 --> 23:38.089
Thank you!

23:38.449 --> 23:38.869
I'm happy!

23:38.929 --> 23:39.630
Welcome Justin!

23:39.650 --> 23:39.930
BAU BAU!

23:45.273 --> 23:47.834
It's been exciting, huh, Ruffians?

23:47.934 --> 23:49.715
It's been very exciting, yeah.

23:50.055 --> 23:51.595
Just take a yobi yobi.

23:51.856 --> 23:52.516
BAU BAU!

23:52.556 --> 23:57.458
On the topic of... Moco-chan!

23:57.558 --> 24:00.920
On the topic of exciting!

24:00.980 --> 24:05.242
I thought we were on the topic of figs.

24:05.782 --> 24:07.423
No, no, no, no!

24:07.523 --> 24:09.283
This is on the topic of figs!

24:09.363 --> 24:10.744
Figs!

24:10.824 --> 24:12.765
Ruffians, we had some amazing

24:13.946 --> 24:18.549
We're so happy to let you know, but FUWAMOCO!

24:18.789 --> 24:25.814
We're gonna be special guests at Good Smile Company's panel at Anime Expo!

24:25.934 --> 24:27.235
BAU BAU!

24:27.295 --> 24:28.275
BAU BAU!

24:28.415 --> 24:29.476
BAU BAU!

24:29.516 --> 24:30.056
BAU BAU!

24:36.040 --> 24:38.302
Are you going to be there, Ruffians?

24:38.662 --> 24:41.484
Maybe you had some fun summer plans in LA?

24:41.504 --> 24:45.487
If you did, maybe we'll see you there!

24:45.807 --> 24:48.369
Thank you, Ruffians!

24:48.709 --> 24:54.894
We are so, so incredibly honored and just absolutely thrilled to be a part of this.

24:54.914 --> 24:56.935
You know how much we love figures, right?

24:59.777 --> 25:07.061
FUWAMOCO, since we've been small little puppies, we've actually been collecting figures, and we love them so much!

25:07.181 --> 25:11.563
And Good Smiles figures have been a very special part of our collection.

25:12.064 --> 25:21.209
Even FUWAMOCO, we remember looking at the very first Nendoroid to come out, together with the mama puppy, and we were like, oh they're so cute!

25:21.469 --> 25:23.450
So we collect them all!

25:26.195 --> 25:29.459
We decided to only get our very favorite characters.

25:29.499 --> 25:31.221
Which is a good decision.

25:31.241 --> 25:32.863
Yeah, good decision.

25:33.043 --> 25:33.664
There's over 2,000!

25:33.884 --> 25:36.307
2,000 Nendoroids!

25:37.048 --> 25:37.528
Yeah.

25:37.629 --> 25:38.289
A good decision.

25:38.490 --> 25:39.951
Good decision.

25:40.912 --> 25:43.656
Yeah, I don't have a big enough doghouse for that many Nendoroids.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.877
No, that's a lot of space.

25:45.077 --> 25:45.478
Yeah.

25:47.660 --> 25:58.429
But we'll be on the panel together with Yago-san himself and the founder of Good Smile Company, Takanori Aki!

25:58.930 --> 26:01.092
We're super novice Ruffians!

26:01.132 --> 26:02.133
What are we gonna do?

26:02.553 --> 26:06.897
What should we do to be able to share our love for figures even more, Ruffians?

26:08.838 --> 26:09.859
What are we gonna do?

26:10.139 --> 26:11.240
What are we gonna say?

26:11.821 --> 26:16.385
We can, you know... I think we're gonna say a bit more than that.

26:16.405 --> 26:21.169
FUWAMOCO, what's your thoughts on this?

26:21.189 --> 26:24.892
That's it, that's it.

26:25.373 --> 26:27.134
I think we gotta do better than that.

26:27.154 --> 26:31.578
So we're gonna do our best, okay?

26:31.779 --> 26:34.101
I'll talk about your version and on.

26:34.281 --> 26:34.541
What?

26:38.324 --> 26:40.525
I know that the rarest nendoroid is Ryofuko-chan.

26:41.566 --> 26:42.226
I wanted it.

26:42.987 --> 26:44.808
It's really cute.

26:45.248 --> 26:46.309
And I like the opening theme.

26:46.609 --> 26:47.469
It's not gonna happen.

26:47.589 --> 26:48.370
Never gonna happen.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.111
But I think we have number 37.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.152
Hostile Inc.

26:58.914 --> 27:00.675
Tell them about your collection.

27:00.935 --> 27:03.776
I don't know if it's the right time for that.

27:04.316 --> 27:11.298
Yeah, but there's gonna be announcements and prizes, so Ruffians, please don't forget about it, okay?

27:11.678 --> 27:17.759
We hope that you'll be cheering on these geeky puppies that are in FUWAMOCO one-to-one.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.560
You love too much, though.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.646
Since we're making our first appearance at Anime Expo, okay?

27:24.607 --> 27:26.390
BAU BAU!

27:26.450 --> 27:29.676
Let's all show our power together, okay?

27:29.716 --> 27:30.878
BAU BAU!

27:33.083 --> 27:35.064
Breaking Dimensions!

27:35.245 --> 27:36.225
BAU BAU!

27:36.546 --> 27:49.575
hololive English's second concert, Breaking Dimensions, is happening in August.

27:49.695 --> 27:50.375
August 24th and 25th.

27:52.016 --> 27:55.078
Anyways, we just announced that there's gonna be some guests!

27:55.458 --> 27:58.700
First we have Kobo-senpai announced!

27:59.120 --> 28:00.981
And now Muna-senpai!

28:01.041 --> 28:04.022
And there's two more interesting shapes here.

28:04.042 --> 28:06.424
Oh, this shape's called senpai.

28:06.904 --> 28:08.305
Senpai shapes.

28:08.445 --> 28:10.005
Who do you think these senpai shapes are?

28:10.286 --> 28:10.946
Ruffians!

28:12.587 --> 28:13.467
Two more?

28:13.607 --> 28:14.688
Lump and Lumpy.

28:15.275 --> 28:16.096
Lumpy lumpy.

28:16.116 --> 28:18.858
A slime.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.179
Yes, a slime.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.120
Pero!

28:22.361 --> 28:23.462
I don't think it's Pero.

28:23.602 --> 28:26.644
Why would anyone call him the guest on anything, huh?

28:26.985 --> 28:30.808
Well, I heard YMCA is Pero's favorite song to sing, right?

28:31.429 --> 28:32.110
You don't want to see that?

28:32.130 --> 28:32.930
I don't know.

28:32.990 --> 28:35.112
That would break too many dimensions, okay?

28:35.152 --> 28:36.773
That's true.

28:36.793 --> 28:42.157
Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll find out soon who these two muffy senpai shapes are.

28:43.037 --> 28:50.083
But, most importantly, Ruffians, you might have kind of let your guard down, but it's okay because these guard dogs, we have it for you.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.163
I don't want that to happen.

28:51.203 --> 28:51.323
No.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.004
Yeah, the tickets that-

28:52.124 --> 29:03.894
In-venue in-person tickets for Breaking Dimensions goes on sale on Friday the 28th at 6pm PT, 9pm EDT, or the 29th 10am JST.

29:04.555 --> 29:05.356
Really soon!

29:05.436 --> 29:07.297
It's finally really soon!

29:07.338 --> 29:09.960
We'll remind you again next FUWAMOCO Morning.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.103
Yeah, because we're super excited!

29:12.183 --> 29:13.264
It's gonna be a battle!

29:13.364 --> 29:13.885
Yeah!

29:13.945 --> 29:16.248
So you can't let your guard down!

29:16.268 --> 29:26.182
For Ruffians that are a little bit far away from the King's Theatre in New York, there are online digital streaming tickets available right now!

29:26.202 --> 29:26.662
Right now!

29:27.123 --> 29:31.346
Please go get them over on the SPW and on the Spawn website.

29:31.946 --> 29:37.050
Because FUWAMOCO will be making our first concert appearance there too!

29:38.030 --> 29:38.131
Yes!

29:38.211 --> 29:38.751
Two days!

29:38.871 --> 29:40.652
Not one day, Moco-chan!

29:40.692 --> 29:41.413
Two days!

29:47.618 --> 29:59.268
And Ruffians, if you thought you know that this is an amazing concert, I gotta get a t-shirt, I gotta get some merch, right now you can still get your merch set on the official hololive website.

29:59.808 --> 30:03.992
It's actually extended, so if you're a little forgetful, it's okay, it happens.

30:05.212 --> 30:07.674
You can still get it, but there is some unfortunate news.

30:07.914 --> 30:10.195
The sets only come with one penlight.

30:10.816 --> 30:15.719
So that means, you know, that maybe you might need two penlights.

30:15.959 --> 30:19.621
Yeah, you might need to snag a friend's penlight.

30:19.681 --> 30:21.742
Excuse me, I would like to borrow that there.

30:21.942 --> 30:23.463
Buy two sets.

30:23.663 --> 30:25.625
Or you could always make your own penlight.

30:26.445 --> 30:29.246
We are alright.

30:29.546 --> 30:30.647
Lots of ideas!

30:30.787 --> 30:33.188
You can't have blue and pink at the same time.

30:33.208 --> 30:34.428
You need two.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.289
Okay.

30:36.329 --> 30:40.010
There's still some time to figure out what to do with the dilemma.

30:40.070 --> 30:41.151
Make your choices!

30:42.752 --> 30:47.193
We hope that you look forward to it just as much as we are, Ruffians!

30:47.213 --> 30:47.834
BAU BAU!

30:50.605 --> 30:57.687
Is this something exciting, Moco-chan?

30:57.707 --> 30:59.628
Is this something sad?

31:22.238 --> 31:25.200
Well, we have some news, Ruffians.

31:26.061 --> 31:27.101
Biboo was kidnapped.

31:27.782 --> 31:28.542
She was kidnapped.

31:28.582 --> 31:29.043
Kidnapped.

31:29.223 --> 31:30.724
Kidnapped for good this time.

31:31.184 --> 31:31.665
Yeah.

31:32.545 --> 31:33.066
Yeah.

31:33.246 --> 31:33.586
Yeah.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.527
I'm sorry that it's a bit alarming.

31:36.268 --> 31:36.728
Yeah.

31:36.808 --> 31:37.609
She was kidnapped.

31:39.110 --> 31:41.392
Before Justice made their debut,

31:42.152 --> 31:45.314
Biboo was kidnapped by a group of criminals.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.976
Innocent criminals called Advent.

31:49.537 --> 31:53.880
We had to kidnap her away from the pebbles while she was playing Elden Ring.

31:53.900 --> 31:58.583
You know, cause she was having a lot of fun and then there was a let's in the boss.

31:58.743 --> 32:01.946
Yeah, you might not have heard it, but we broke down the door.

32:01.966 --> 32:03.066
We broke down the door.

32:04.067 --> 32:04.967
We stormed the room!

32:04.987 --> 32:07.768
We stormed the room and told her, you have to get out!

32:08.028 --> 32:10.088
I'm gonna turn off the computer!

32:10.148 --> 32:10.508
Yeah.

32:10.588 --> 32:12.309
And we even tickled her, Ruffians.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.289
We even tickled her.

32:13.309 --> 32:13.389
Yeah.

32:13.649 --> 32:14.789
In a ticklish spot.

32:15.049 --> 32:15.409
Yeah!

32:15.569 --> 32:17.530
And she... She was gaming.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.430
She did not react.

32:19.470 --> 32:20.450
She was a rock.

32:20.650 --> 32:21.170
She was a rock.

32:21.210 --> 32:22.311
Somehow that's surprising.

32:22.331 --> 32:22.411
Yeah.

32:22.871 --> 32:24.331
Yeah.

32:24.671 --> 32:27.492
I don't know, when Biboo's gaming, she is gaming.

32:28.072 --> 32:33.833
And, uh, I think Pebbles already realized this, but Biboo gaming is very cute.

32:36.295 --> 32:37.917
But she was also sweating a lot too.

32:38.057 --> 32:38.277
What?!

32:38.437 --> 32:41.580
But that might have had to do with the fact that she was getting kidnapped by Alphys.

32:41.600 --> 32:41.941
And tickled!

32:41.961 --> 32:43.422
Yeah, yeah.

32:43.542 --> 32:49.028
I did think, you know, I'm gonna pull the chair away but I decided that that's maybe a bit too cool.

32:49.188 --> 32:51.130
I know we talked about wanting to do that.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.191
She's almost done with the boss, so.

32:53.211 --> 32:53.511
Yeah.

32:53.872 --> 32:54.072
But!

32:54.092 --> 32:55.053
We showed mercy.

32:55.473 --> 32:59.155
Just in time, Biboo was able to fell the hajim.

32:59.356 --> 33:01.817
And made it in time for Justice's debut.

33:01.837 --> 33:02.438
Yeah!

33:02.458 --> 33:03.458
Yeah.

33:03.539 --> 33:09.703
But, uh, if you wanna hear what it sounds like for Abbot to kidnap Biboo, go check it out.

33:09.843 --> 33:10.363
BAU BAU!

33:19.257 --> 33:23.158
Ruffians, how has the week been going so far, huh?

33:25.159 --> 33:26.900
Hopefully you have some more energy.

33:27.701 --> 33:31.763
But maybe you need a little bit of a push too.

33:32.483 --> 33:34.064
Pick me up.

33:34.624 --> 33:37.605
Moco-chan, you're still sleepy.

33:37.986 --> 33:39.426
A bit rough.

33:40.147 --> 33:41.207
Tough but going.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.067
I get it.

33:42.087 --> 33:42.868
It's been alright.

33:43.454 --> 33:44.895
Could be better though, right?

33:45.456 --> 33:48.638
Well, maybe you need a bit of a talk then!

33:48.658 --> 33:54.944
Ruffians!

33:56.545 --> 33:58.667
It's that time again!

33:58.687 --> 34:00.729
You're right!

34:01.589 --> 34:04.192
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

34:04.932 --> 34:07.354
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

34:07.775 --> 34:08.095
Mococo!

34:12.182 --> 34:13.943
How are things going, Ruffians?

34:15.764 --> 34:21.248
You know, before we even realized it, it seems like we're in the thick of summer already!

34:21.268 --> 34:25.330
Are you keeping your energy levels up?

34:26.811 --> 34:29.473
You won't let the heat and the humidity zap at you, right?

34:30.533 --> 34:30.894
Right?

34:32.795 --> 34:38.839
One thing that's important is that you make sure to keep yourself refreshed by not only just drinking water,

34:39.723 --> 34:43.006
But by keeping up with trying out new things every now and then too.

34:43.026 --> 34:45.087
You know?

34:46.128 --> 34:53.774
It's always a great feeling of accomplishment when you can give yourself a pat on the back after trying something that was, uh, maybe a bit scary.

34:53.794 --> 34:55.735
You know?

34:56.616 --> 34:57.517
I know you can do it.

34:58.698 --> 34:59.658
No matter what you think.

35:00.139 --> 35:00.999
You're strong!

35:01.440 --> 35:02.280
It won't faze you.

35:03.621 --> 35:06.464
In the end, you'll be glad you tried and didn't regret it.

35:06.684 --> 35:07.945
No matter the outcome, okay?

35:08.892 --> 35:11.675
So, let's take control of this summer.

35:12.015 --> 35:15.438
This summer of Advent and say no!

35:16.339 --> 35:21.444
Actually, this is the summer of me!

35:22.785 --> 35:25.708
Let's all do our best to make it an unforgettable summer, okay?

35:26.629 --> 35:28.370
Ganbatte ne!

35:28.430 --> 35:29.972
BAU BAU!

35:30.472 --> 35:31.473
BAU BAU!

35:34.761 --> 35:39.423
The summer of Advent and the summer of you, Ruffians!

35:39.443 --> 35:40.103
BAU BAU!

36:03.338 --> 36:03.538
Lady!

36:03.658 --> 36:04.119
Lady!

36:04.139 --> 36:06.120
So cute!

36:06.160 --> 36:06.320
Lady!

36:21.771 --> 36:22.831
She's woofy!

36:23.232 --> 36:24.733
And has boobies!

36:25.533 --> 36:27.694
And has butt scrunchies!

36:28.235 --> 36:31.957
And adjustable anything that can fit in her mouth!

36:32.097 --> 36:32.918
And has donuts!

36:32.958 --> 36:34.079
And you know what?

36:34.539 --> 36:35.760
I love Winnie!

36:35.960 --> 36:41.844
Winnie, look at Winnie's eyes!

36:41.884 --> 36:43.084
That's a puppy!

36:43.264 --> 36:44.685
That's a puppy!

36:44.745 --> 36:46.386
Baby Fuwawa, excuse me!

36:47.702 --> 36:50.244
Little baby Mococo, hi!

36:50.344 --> 36:53.167
It's me, it's Moco-chan!

36:53.247 --> 36:53.367
Hi!

36:53.407 --> 36:53.987
Hi!

36:54.008 --> 36:56.350
BAU BAU!

36:57.190 --> 37:01.114
I think Winnie, Winnie BAU BAU is like... BAU BAU!

37:01.514 --> 37:02.795
BAU BAU!

37:02.875 --> 37:04.917
BAU BAU!

37:04.997 --> 37:07.019
Winnie, Winnie.

37:07.379 --> 37:09.161
Winnie, you're too cute.

37:09.401 --> 37:10.662
Look at Winnie's ears.

37:10.722 --> 37:11.783
My ears are cuter though.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.908
BAU BAU!

37:16.948 --> 37:18.428
Can we give Winnie a ranking?

37:18.448 --> 37:19.749
A ranking?

37:19.829 --> 37:20.329
A rating?

37:21.770 --> 37:22.310
Ranking.

37:22.730 --> 37:23.991
My brain is broken.

37:24.011 --> 37:25.271
That's Winnie.

37:25.291 --> 37:25.471
Winnie.

37:25.491 --> 37:26.452
Breaker of brains.

37:36.332 --> 37:36.732
That's it.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.433
BAU BAU!

37:39.453 --> 37:46.496
And let's take a look at the work we've been going over for you.

37:46.716 --> 37:50.178
Today's work is... De-den!

37:50.218 --> 37:51.138
Mococo Sky!

37:51.198 --> 37:53.679
A FUWAMOCO colored sky above the snow.

37:53.699 --> 37:54.580
A Mococo Sky!

37:54.600 --> 37:56.581
No more white about Mococo, right?

37:56.761 --> 37:59.202
Yeah, it's a Moco-chan sky.

37:59.602 --> 38:01.723
Well, I hope you go home safe.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.304
I'm gonna assume you go home safe since you uploaded this.

38:06.126 --> 38:07.368
Twitter.

38:07.548 --> 38:09.350
I don't think a ghost can upload to Twitter, huh?

38:10.751 --> 38:18.074
Well, I'm glad that you know you got to see a beautiful sky to calm you down after what I'm sure was a very busy day.

38:18.174 --> 38:18.634
Right.

38:19.394 --> 38:21.815
BAU BAU!

38:21.835 --> 38:25.736
Time for our Question of the Day!

38:25.756 --> 38:26.856
We have de-den!

38:26.896 --> 38:30.718
Morning FUWAMOCO!

38:30.778 --> 38:31.718
Morning!

38:32.578 --> 38:33.459
BAU BAU!

38:33.799 --> 38:36.820
This question was in my mind for almost a year now!

38:36.840 --> 38:39.901
How come as demon guard dogs,

38:40.261 --> 38:43.702
You decided to protect our smiles instead of steal them.

38:44.203 --> 38:45.483
Aren't demons evil?

38:45.503 --> 38:50.965
And we unintentionally sold our souls for this.

38:50.985 --> 38:53.506
That's a very cute illustration.

38:53.627 --> 38:56.528
A very accurate one of FUWAMOCO.

38:57.028 --> 39:06.912
But to answer your question, you know, sometimes, and this isn't everyone, but sometimes people don't want their smiles protected.

39:07.873 --> 39:12.155
So, you know, we try to ask, you know, is it okay if we protect your smile?

39:12.275 --> 39:12.896
We try.

39:12.916 --> 39:14.457
Is it okay to boil your smile?

39:14.517 --> 39:15.057
Try.

39:15.437 --> 39:22.762
But sometimes we do accidentally protect smiles even if you don't want it to be.

39:22.782 --> 39:23.162
Yeah.

39:23.983 --> 39:27.905
And some people think, you know, that's pretty demonic.

39:27.965 --> 39:28.225
Right?

39:28.285 --> 39:28.446
Yeah.

39:28.506 --> 39:29.646
Right?

39:29.666 --> 39:31.768
We're gonna protect your smile!

39:31.788 --> 39:33.649
We're gonna protect your smile!

39:34.269 --> 39:36.170
Whether you like it or not.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.931
We'll protect it, okay?

39:39.451 --> 39:40.631
Very demonic, right?

39:41.972 --> 39:44.872
Resistance is futile.

39:45.193 --> 39:47.893
We're FUWAMOCO!

39:48.033 --> 39:51.895
It's futile.

39:51.995 --> 39:52.395
Got it.

39:52.795 --> 39:54.295
That's why.

39:55.496 --> 39:57.476
That's why these puppies are demon-grinded.

39:57.516 --> 39:58.177
Got it.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.014
Yeah, we'll protect it.

40:01.474 --> 40:02.635
BAU BAU!

40:03.395 --> 40:04.136
BAU BAU!

40:04.336 --> 40:04.456
Hi!

40:04.556 --> 40:07.938
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

40:08.258 --> 40:08.539
Thank you!

40:08.559 --> 40:10.780
We're always looking for new submissions.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.562
Your puppy's very cute puppy winning today.

40:13.582 --> 40:13.682
Right.

40:14.382 --> 40:16.904
Your doggies, your questions.

40:17.684 --> 40:23.608
All of them, so please let us know what's on your mind with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

40:23.708 --> 40:24.789
BAU BAU!

40:25.129 --> 40:27.190
BAU BAU!

40:27.451 --> 40:29.092
And for our next stream,

40:29.692 --> 40:32.373
We have... De-den!

40:32.853 --> 40:35.213
The game of sis wheels!

40:36.433 --> 40:36.733
Yeah.

40:37.794 --> 40:39.874
We're gonna be rolling on a big rock each.

40:40.274 --> 40:42.195
One rock for me, one rock for you.

40:42.215 --> 40:42.755
And Mococo!

40:42.775 --> 40:44.355
We're not gonna have to share the rock.

40:44.515 --> 40:47.276
Because we're versusing each other!

40:47.696 --> 40:49.956
Yeah, sister versus sister.

40:49.996 --> 40:50.256
Yeah.

40:50.396 --> 40:51.636
Who is the strongest?

40:51.656 --> 40:52.137
Alright.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.677
Who can push it the farthest?

40:53.837 --> 40:54.017
Yeah.

40:54.637 --> 40:56.077
That's what we're gonna be doing.

40:56.557 --> 41:00.098
So Ruffians, we'll need you to kinda help us.

41:00.498 --> 41:02.518
Maybe let us know what to avoid.

41:02.778 --> 41:05.419
Let us know how to beat each other up.

41:05.579 --> 41:06.359
Yeah!

41:06.379 --> 41:07.599
Because we're gonna roll the rock.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.059
We'll find the ultimate winner.

41:09.079 --> 41:09.660
Oh yeah.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.380
BAU BAU!

41:13.560 --> 41:14.760
BAU BAU!

41:14.800 --> 41:16.141
And our schedule!

41:16.161 --> 41:20.861
After that, well, on Thursday we're playing Portal 2 together!

41:21.121 --> 41:22.282
Ah, cool!

41:22.422 --> 41:23.642
Cool, yeah!

41:24.542 --> 41:31.129
We've never played Portal before, but we've heard a lot of Ruffians suggesting FUWAMOCO, you should check it out!

41:31.509 --> 41:36.734
And we're always interested in playing fun games, because all games are fun to play!

41:36.774 --> 41:40.838
So we're gonna do our best and see just how much fun Portal 2 is!

41:40.858 --> 41:41.739
BAU BAU!

41:41.759 --> 41:47.485
And then of course we have FUWAMOCO Off Morning on Friday!

41:47.945 --> 41:52.748
So we hope that you'll wake up and join us for the last FUWAMOCO Morning of the week.

41:52.908 --> 41:56.130
BAU BAU!

41:56.150 --> 42:04.736
And for the Ruffians who are joining us through the archives today, here is your FUWAMOCO word to write in the comments.

42:06.717 --> 42:08.659
It's BAU BAU!

42:09.865 --> 42:11.345

42:11.726 --> 42:14.306

42:15.127 --> 42:23.069

42:23.229 --> 42:24.409

42:24.469 --> 42:30.391
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

42:31.211 --> 42:32.212
