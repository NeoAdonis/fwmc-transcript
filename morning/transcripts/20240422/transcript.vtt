05:09.400 --> 05:11.421
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.441 --> 05:15.224
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:15.244 --> 05:19.167
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:19.187 --> 05:21.288
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:21.988 --> 05:24.870
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:25.291 --> 05:27.592
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.752 --> 05:30.474
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.534 --> 05:32.515
BAU BAU BAU!

05:33.196 --> 05:37.759
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:38.019 --> 05:38.640
Ruffians!

05:39.620 --> 05:42.664
Thank you for joining us today for the 88th episode!

05:44.425 --> 05:46.668
BAU BAU!

05:46.688 --> 05:48.990
88 episodes!

05:52.995 --> 05:55.777
That's today's episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:55.817 --> 06:01.482
Wait, does that mean that FUWAMOCO Morning... Eternal FUWAMOCO Morning...

06:14.440 --> 06:17.021
Ruffians, damn right!

06:17.101 --> 06:18.461
It's been a long time.

06:19.081 --> 06:20.722
I miss FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:21.262 --> 06:21.502
But!

06:21.922 --> 06:26.463
Ruffians, in case you're joining us today for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is not endless.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.883
That's not the kind of show it is.

06:28.243 --> 06:28.583
No!

06:29.064 --> 06:35.945
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:36.085 --> 06:36.625
A.K.A.

06:36.685 --> 06:37.606
FUWAMOCO!

06:37.926 --> 06:38.926
Hosted by us.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.827
FUWAMOCO!

06:40.847 --> 06:47.069
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:47.509 --> 06:52.410
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:52.790 --> 06:57.152
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:57.352 --> 06:59.593
BAU BAU!

07:01.153 --> 07:04.554
Yeah, Fuwamoco Eternal with Extreme Violence.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.715
What about Eternal Violence?

07:09.706 --> 07:11.987
I don't think we can have that.

07:12.187 --> 07:13.007
No.

07:13.587 --> 07:16.268
Yeah.

07:16.388 --> 07:19.490
BAU BAU!

07:19.890 --> 07:22.751
Well, the start of a brand new week, Moco-chan!

07:23.231 --> 07:25.812
What kind of week is it gonna be?

07:25.832 --> 07:27.672
Zombie.

07:27.692 --> 07:30.253
Zombie.

07:30.273 --> 07:34.395
There was another Pero Sighting.

07:36.476 --> 07:37.136
But you know,

07:38.180 --> 07:41.283
I think it's important that you're up to date!

07:43.004 --> 07:45.046
This time... Where was he seen?

07:45.066 --> 07:47.948
De-den!

07:48.368 --> 07:48.488
Oh!

07:49.389 --> 07:49.489
Oh!

07:49.609 --> 07:49.709
Oh!

07:50.070 --> 07:50.190
Oh!

07:50.270 --> 07:52.232
I almost didn't see him there, hi!

07:52.652 --> 07:54.633
You know, it's such a lovely field.

07:55.034 --> 07:56.335
Fluffy flowers.

07:57.236 --> 07:58.997
And then... Pero.

08:00.979 --> 08:04.742
You know... It kinda looks like he's stalking you.

08:06.143 --> 08:06.183
Oh...

08:10.540 --> 08:14.724
Maybe, you know, maybe he thought he blended in with the fluffy flowers too.

08:15.405 --> 08:15.625
No!

08:16.225 --> 08:18.067
Not quite!

08:18.428 --> 08:18.628
No.

08:19.409 --> 08:19.769
No.

08:20.009 --> 08:21.390
Pero's nasty.

08:21.891 --> 08:22.692
Not fluffy.

08:24.033 --> 08:27.076
You know, if anything, filthy.

08:27.176 --> 08:29.799
Not fluffy.

08:29.819 --> 08:33.122
Flowers, fluffy, Moco-chan's fuzzy, and Pero...

08:33.766 --> 08:34.126
Filthy.

08:34.146 --> 08:34.987
Not a flower.

08:35.007 --> 08:35.267
Filthy.

08:44.733 --> 08:50.095
It's a bit cuter and more lovely than some of the other Pero Sightings we've had recently.

08:50.135 --> 08:50.315
True.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.856
Last time it was a speed bump.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.176
Right!

08:53.496 --> 08:55.657
This time, lovely flowers.

08:56.217 --> 08:59.258
Yeah, it's very picture-esque, you know?

08:59.278 --> 09:05.680
And aside from Pero being there in the field, you know, it kinda... I kinda wanna make it into a painting.

09:05.740 --> 09:06.221
Right.

09:06.281 --> 09:09.062
You know, maybe use oil paint or something.

09:09.222 --> 09:09.782
Oil paint!

09:10.002 --> 09:11.823
Yeah, it's very lovely.

09:11.863 --> 09:12.203
Yeah.

09:12.543 --> 09:12.943
Yeah.

09:13.363 --> 09:20.877
Hopefully you know, maybe he got distracted by a delicious looking flower like he's a bee or something and left you alone.

09:20.898 --> 09:21.739
BAU BAU!

09:26.638 --> 09:29.599
Yeah, that looks like a lot of nice flowers.

09:29.899 --> 09:35.300
I think I'd get distracted too if I was... BAU BAU.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.701
BAU BAU!

09:38.901 --> 09:41.762
Well, today... Today is the 22nd!

09:41.782 --> 09:45.783
Which means... Ollie-senpai!

09:46.003 --> 09:52.525
Ollie-senpai's visual novel, Days with Ollie, has been released!

09:52.605 --> 09:55.066
It released on Steam today!

09:55.846 --> 09:56.747
Ruffians!

09:57.948 --> 09:59.328
Have you been able to check it out?

09:59.348 --> 10:01.690
Is it in your Steam wishlist?

10:02.230 --> 10:03.071
Is it in your cart?

10:03.411 --> 10:04.772
Is it in your library?

10:04.792 --> 10:07.133
Do you have it installed?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.494
Is it in your heart?

10:10.335 --> 10:15.018
You know sometimes they ask, do you want to install this game to the desktop?

10:15.038 --> 10:18.781
But they never ask, do you want to install it to your heart?

10:20.527 --> 10:22.508
You might want to do that this time.

10:22.769 --> 10:27.952
But I want to say a big congratulations to Ollie-senpai!

10:28.072 --> 10:29.934
BAU BAU!

10:30.414 --> 10:31.475
Yeah, FUWAMOCO.

10:31.775 --> 10:39.800
You know us, we love visual novels, so we're really excited to check it out and see what kind of silly story and maybe roots it has.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.881
Maybe it's linear.

10:41.021 --> 10:41.481
I don't know yet.

10:41.802 --> 10:43.403
I haven't been able to check it out.

10:43.963 --> 10:54.108
But, you know, we can definitely see just all the love that Ally-senpai put into this and all the creators who also worked on it together with her that they put into it.

10:54.528 --> 10:58.150
So we really hope that you'll check it out too, Ruffians!

10:58.810 --> 10:59.851
You might check it out!

11:00.591 --> 11:04.173
Wow, if you put it in the Steam Wishlist, right?

11:04.433 --> 11:06.554
Then no matter how busy you are,

11:07.648 --> 11:09.648
You'll eventually remember it, right?

11:09.868 --> 11:12.029
It'll remind you.

11:12.049 --> 11:13.049
Yeah.

11:13.109 --> 11:18.590
But, it's a little bit of a shame that you know, we won't be able to check it out together with all of you senpai.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.371
Like we had planned last week.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.391
Yeah, there's so many questions we wanted to ask her.

11:23.651 --> 11:30.033
Yeah, but once we do have a moment to check it out, we'll definitely give it a play.

11:30.073 --> 11:30.193
Yes!

11:30.233 --> 11:33.373
Please let us know what you think of it too, Ruffians, okay?

11:33.473 --> 11:33.693
Right!

11:33.893 --> 11:36.734
You know, it'll be good research to know once

11:37.403 --> 11:41.786
We're able to make a rural convention of life we've been dreaming of one day.

11:42.126 --> 11:50.271
Yeah, I like how in days ago you got to do this and I think it would be cool, you know, if FUWAMOCO, maybe if they did something like this.

11:50.411 --> 11:50.831
Right!

11:50.971 --> 11:51.872
That kind of thing.

11:51.892 --> 11:52.713
You installed it!

11:53.755 --> 11:57.338
BAU BAU!

11:57.858 --> 12:00.200
Oh, you need to make more room on the computer.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.201
Do it!

12:01.581 --> 12:02.182
Do it!

12:02.882 --> 12:04.623
Maybe that's today's challenge.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.925
You know, a new week and everything.

12:06.965 --> 12:07.846
New challenge!

12:08.266 --> 12:12.049
Definitely a bit of a challenge for Mococo-chan when you have to make space right.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.231
On the computer.

12:14.611 --> 12:15.332
I'm on the phone.

12:18.495 --> 12:21.779
BAU BAU!

12:21.839 --> 12:23.801
Such exciting news!

12:25.483 --> 12:27.465
And more exciting news!

12:27.846 --> 12:32.411
This upcoming weekend, there's a big event going on at home!

12:33.812 --> 12:46.048
Man, you might already know if you checked out our new schedule, but it's the Holodotal K-2024 event hosted by Iroha-senpai and the rest of H.O.L.D.!

12:46.148 --> 12:48.631
Yeah, we're really excited to be a part of it!

12:49.352 --> 12:52.093
You know, it's an event hosted in Minecraft.

12:52.213 --> 12:54.974
And we have to gather as many Yamadollies.

12:55.014 --> 12:56.574
Yamadollies, yeah.

12:56.714 --> 13:00.256
As possible to escape the theme park without getting caught by the police.

13:00.716 --> 13:01.836
Arholic-senpai!

13:01.876 --> 13:02.076
Yeah.

13:02.276 --> 13:03.297
They're the police.

13:03.317 --> 13:03.577
Yeah.

13:04.117 --> 13:10.539
You know, so this means we need to get a little bit crafty to be able to figure out how we can win the Yamadollies as fast as we can.

13:10.559 --> 13:10.839
Alright.

13:11.579 --> 13:12.620
Without being caught.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.520
Without being caught.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.460
Don't say it out loud.

13:14.480 --> 13:14.740
Sneaky.

13:15.120 --> 13:15.561
You don't, uh...

13:17.699 --> 13:24.442
Ruffians, this time, you know, maybe you remember back when there was the sports festival too.

13:24.462 --> 13:25.503
Right?

13:25.563 --> 13:28.484
That was our first time and we were a little nervous.

13:28.664 --> 13:29.404
Just a bit.

13:29.464 --> 13:34.847
But this time, Ruffians, Moco-chan, she's playing on her own.

13:35.507 --> 13:39.529
And I, I'm playing on my own too!

13:39.809 --> 13:41.790
Yeah, with two computers.

13:43.110 --> 13:46.452
Two, so, yeah, two points of use.

13:47.423 --> 13:50.646
If everything works out.

13:50.706 --> 13:55.150
So this way, you know, we can team up together and try to escape.

13:55.531 --> 14:00.295
You know, maybe I'll sacrifice myself for you, Moco-chan.

14:00.696 --> 14:02.397
It looks like we're both gonna get caught.

14:03.158 --> 14:05.801
But I don't think that means you can have my Yamadolls.

14:05.941 --> 14:06.221
No.

14:06.521 --> 14:06.942
Yeah.

14:07.402 --> 14:11.927
But we'll also be playing, you know, together with a bunch of my senpai!

14:11.947 --> 14:14.289
Ien Senpai, Ainin Senpai, JP Senpai.

14:14.530 --> 14:18.594
But also Nerissa and Biboo will be there participating.

14:18.634 --> 14:21.757
So hopefully we can team up with them too.

14:22.177 --> 14:23.539
Yeah.

14:23.719 --> 14:25.501
I think Biboo might have some good plans.

14:26.021 --> 14:27.243
Nerissa!

14:28.964 --> 14:29.145
Yeah.

14:31.219 --> 14:35.342
We're not sure how it'll go, but we're sure it'll be a lot of fun!

14:35.442 --> 14:36.342
BAU BAU!

14:36.382 --> 14:37.443
Look at the cute visuals, it's so cute!

14:37.463 --> 14:37.883
Look at those outfits!

14:47.870 --> 14:49.051
Not quite police outfit.

14:49.091 --> 14:50.152
No, not this year.

14:50.172 --> 14:52.855
This time they're park staff.

14:52.895 --> 14:54.357
Very cute.

14:54.417 --> 14:56.279
BAU BAU!

14:56.359 --> 15:04.948
We're excited to be participating in another big event!

15:04.968 --> 15:07.630
But, we're Ruffians.

15:08.031 --> 15:10.954
You know, we're always

15:12.082 --> 15:14.223
Looking to see what kind of ideas you have.

15:14.364 --> 15:18.426
And recently, we got an interesting question.

15:18.927 --> 15:21.929
You know, Ruffians, we see that

15:23.044 --> 15:23.964
Maybe not today.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.065
Maybe not today.

15:25.405 --> 15:26.705
Maybe today.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.366
Maybe today.

15:27.446 --> 15:34.228
You know, there's sometimes, there's days when you're just not able to wake up for FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

15:34.548 --> 15:35.528
And that's okay.

15:35.729 --> 15:36.189
Yeah.

15:36.649 --> 15:39.150
Or say, you know, you've had a busy time recently.

15:39.370 --> 15:39.910
Yeah.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.491
We want you to get lots of sleep!

15:41.771 --> 15:48.673
But you know, it makes us really, really happy to know that you're still watching, even with the archive of the stream on here.

15:48.693 --> 15:49.093
Right.

15:49.153 --> 15:50.814
Yeah, you know.

15:51.654 --> 16:01.346
And we know that there's been a number of Ruffians asking if they can get a special shout out for Ruffians who are joining us with the archive.

16:01.647 --> 16:04.790
So, so Ruffians!

16:05.051 --> 16:08.054
From here on after.

16:08.395 --> 16:09.156
Here on after?

16:09.196 --> 16:10.798
Here on after, here on out, yes.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.199
Yes, yes.

16:14.379 --> 16:15.540
Ruffians!

16:15.600 --> 16:22.823
We want to share a special FUWAMOCO word with you at the end of each stream.

16:23.063 --> 16:24.344
A FUWAMOCO word.

16:28.326 --> 16:33.589
You know, that way you can share with us in the comments and maybe a few thoughts.

16:33.609 --> 16:35.389
A few thoughts that you had.

16:36.850 --> 16:38.172
You know, if you have time.

16:38.212 --> 16:39.875
Only if you have time, right?

16:40.456 --> 16:47.306
Yeah, so that means, Ruffians, maybe today you're watching us through the icon!

16:48.666 --> 16:54.929
Don't forget that you shared the FUWAMOCO word with us in the comments at the end, okay?

16:55.069 --> 17:01.712
You know, whether you're here with us live or joining us through the archives, it makes us really happy to be included in your life.

17:02.212 --> 17:02.692
Thank you!

17:02.752 --> 17:04.193
Don't forget that, okay?

17:04.233 --> 17:06.634
Yeah, FUWAMOCO word, okay?

17:06.814 --> 17:07.234
Yeah.

17:07.914 --> 17:09.675
Should live watchers share it?

17:09.875 --> 17:10.635
If you want to!

17:10.715 --> 17:13.757
If you want to, if that makes you happy, then go for it!

17:17.018 --> 17:18.540
Yeah, FUWAMOCO word.

17:19.681 --> 17:22.603
BAU BAU!

17:22.683 --> 17:23.804
We'll play to it.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.206
Not yet!

17:25.246 --> 17:25.566
Okay.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.448
We're just letting you know.

17:27.948 --> 17:28.368
Got it.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.070
BAU BAU!

17:33.074 --> 17:40.897
Well, you know, this week we're able to start the day off all together just like last week, you know?

17:40.917 --> 17:43.058
Yeah, I hope you start your day off on the right paw!

17:44.258 --> 17:45.778
With FUWAMOCO Morning!

17:45.798 --> 17:46.699
I know!

17:46.719 --> 17:47.459
I know!

17:48.715 --> 17:50.937
Watching almost a hundred episodes!

17:50.957 --> 17:51.877
Oh my gosh.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.740
Episode 88, next to episode 89.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.482
Episode 90 this week!

17:58.343 --> 18:00.244
It's been a lot of mornings spent together!

18:00.704 --> 18:01.005
But!

18:01.245 --> 18:01.445
But!

18:01.745 --> 18:03.306
For the first time ever!

18:04.047 --> 18:07.990
We're gonna be having our guest J-NESFUWAMOCO Morning!

18:08.150 --> 18:12.954
The senpai that's no stranger to morning shows either.

18:13.114 --> 18:14.835
It's Koyori-senpai!

18:14.916 --> 18:16.056
BAU BAU!

18:17.898 --> 18:22.604
We're really excited!

18:22.844 --> 18:23.966
Technically.

18:24.466 --> 18:31.435
You know, this will be the first FWM, not only with the guests, but also an off club.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.038
So it'll be especially new for us.

18:36.580 --> 18:42.262
Do you have any suggestions for Koyori-senpai?

18:42.362 --> 18:45.263
I want to see you do this with Koyori-senpai!

18:45.703 --> 18:51.345
Or maybe this is Fuwawa's turn to force Koyori-senpai to eat natto!

18:51.365 --> 18:52.225
Sleepover!

19:01.932 --> 19:03.013
That hasn't been discussed.

19:03.113 --> 19:04.114
It's FUWAMOCO morning!

19:04.855 --> 19:07.758
It's the morning, okay!

19:07.778 --> 19:07.858
Yeah!

19:08.598 --> 19:10.180
How cool it is to play Nattou!

19:10.740 --> 19:13.383
I bet she's good with Nattou though.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.564
We haven't asked her.

19:14.604 --> 19:15.285
We haven't.

19:15.725 --> 19:16.205
No.

19:16.866 --> 19:19.607
It's not a seafood roll cake!

19:19.688 --> 19:21.649
Not with mayonnaise!

19:36.667 --> 19:44.389
That would be too easy for Koyori-senpai.

19:44.689 --> 19:52.331
What I was thinking is, you know, maybe we could just borrow some of Koyori-senpai's quarters from the Asakoya Morning Show.

19:52.351 --> 19:55.112
You know, just for this special episode, right?

19:55.132 --> 19:57.973
You think she'll be okay with that?

19:57.993 --> 19:58.453
I don't know.

20:01.474 --> 20:05.136
Well, you'll have to join us for Friday Mornings.

20:05.156 --> 20:07.038
FUWAMOCO Morning to find out.

20:07.058 --> 20:11.120
BAU BAU!

20:11.881 --> 20:14.962
We could do a mayonnaise eating competition.

20:14.982 --> 20:18.104
That sounds a little rough right in the morning.

20:18.124 --> 20:19.525
I'm thinking of the results already.

20:19.545 --> 20:23.528
We are not the winners!

20:29.595 --> 20:31.436
We'll have to think even harder.

20:33.318 --> 20:34.438
BAU BAU!

20:34.839 --> 20:35.839
Ruffians.

20:37.881 --> 20:42.664
We had another bit of an incident.

20:42.904 --> 20:43.804
A run-in.

20:44.585 --> 20:46.006
Usually...

20:48.749 --> 20:51.552
We do our best to avoid gachapon machines, right?

20:52.433 --> 20:55.996
In case you don't know, you know, they have the little capsules.

20:57.317 --> 20:57.738
Toy.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.742
Usually a toy inside.

21:01.762 --> 21:06.626
Sometimes, you know, not just toys, but they can be really alluring.

21:06.646 --> 21:13.273
It can kind of be hard to resist sometimes, you know, when you pass like a big wall of the gachapon machines, you're like, oh, I wonder what they

21:13.593 --> 21:13.933
Function.

21:13.953 --> 21:14.113
A use.

21:14.133 --> 21:15.594
The other day when we were out on a quest.

21:40.669 --> 21:44.510
We ran into a Suica Game gachapon machine!

21:44.610 --> 21:46.611
BAU BAU!

21:46.651 --> 21:47.111
Yeah!

21:47.632 --> 21:51.953
And they had a couple of them, but the one that we were like, oh, this is good.

21:52.053 --> 21:56.435
It was filled with little acrylic mascots of each fruit.

21:56.575 --> 21:57.095
Yeah.

21:57.135 --> 21:57.455
Yeah.

21:57.635 --> 22:00.076
And of course, you know, it's Suica Game.

22:00.136 --> 22:06.078
We want to get the watermelon, the protagonist, the star, the show, the game.

22:08.279 --> 22:12.521
Even though, you know, acrylic mask was wasn't really what we wanted.

22:12.721 --> 22:15.462
We figured, we can turn it into a magnet!

22:16.063 --> 22:17.523
Use it on the fridge!

22:18.183 --> 22:19.844
It's a functional use now, right?

22:20.324 --> 22:20.665
Yeah.

22:21.445 --> 22:23.726
So it's okay!

22:23.746 --> 22:24.066
Yeah!

22:24.106 --> 22:24.446
Right!

22:24.546 --> 22:25.667
It's not a good use?

22:25.947 --> 22:26.267
No!

22:26.387 --> 22:26.727
Right!

22:27.167 --> 22:29.848
Creative!

22:29.888 --> 22:30.189
Yeah!

22:30.629 --> 22:33.550
So, you know, we put our coins in.

22:34.030 --> 22:35.471
And we turned the handle.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.784
But nothing happened.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.707
Nothing came out.

22:41.107 --> 22:41.388
Nothing.

22:42.809 --> 22:45.812
Yeah.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.595
Our hearts broke a little bit.

22:48.615 --> 22:52.159
You know, we were trying to figure out- Oh, maybe we did something wrong!

22:52.179 --> 22:52.459
Right!

22:52.719 --> 22:56.163
Maybe Moco-chan didn't- Maybe I didn't push it all the way!

22:56.363 --> 22:56.764
Yeah!

22:58.621 --> 23:03.123
Luckily, we noticed an employee nearby.

23:03.343 --> 23:04.824
We tried not to panic.

23:05.044 --> 23:08.186
We normally didn't want dogs.

23:08.686 --> 23:10.667
They just want to get us so much attention.

23:10.787 --> 23:12.988
I put the money in the machine, but you didn't.

23:13.008 --> 23:15.549
I put the money in the machine, but you didn't.

23:15.869 --> 23:16.810
We very much cried.

23:16.850 --> 23:20.232
Really, really explained the situation to them.

23:22.013 --> 23:26.496
They opened up the machine and looked at it to see, oh, is there anything wrong?

23:26.516 --> 23:28.157
Is the watermelon blocking?

23:28.257 --> 23:29.598
Oh, is it the deco board?

23:30.039 --> 23:31.120
They couldn't see much.

23:31.880 --> 23:36.484
And then they asked us to choose whichever one of the color balls we wanted!

23:36.504 --> 23:36.584
Yes!

23:36.624 --> 23:37.484
Just take one!

23:37.524 --> 23:37.965
Right!

23:38.365 --> 23:38.986
Of course!

23:39.946 --> 23:41.627
We chose the green one!

23:41.648 --> 23:42.969
Cause you know, maybe...

23:43.889 --> 23:45.190
There's a Suica in there.

23:45.210 --> 23:46.591
It's green, you know.

23:47.251 --> 23:51.474
Moco-chan, did you just pick the green one because you think it would have the watermelon in it?

23:51.914 --> 23:54.595
They don't have time to color code them, you know.

23:54.695 --> 23:56.557
They're just gonna put them in there.

23:56.577 --> 23:57.797
Yeah.

23:58.298 --> 23:58.978
But that's lit.

23:59.838 --> 24:00.479
She picked it.

24:00.499 --> 24:02.840
She said we, but she picked it.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.781
Ruffians!

24:07.778 --> 24:12.120
It was the watermelon in there!

24:12.160 --> 24:16.041
We got the king of the watermelon!

24:16.281 --> 24:22.023
So now all that's left is for us to turn it into a proper magnet for our fridge.

24:22.283 --> 24:34.987
But I'm a little bit conflicted because we didn't realize this, but Ruffians, it turns out that you can actually stack them all together to make a proper game, a Suica game.

24:35.047 --> 24:35.287
Yeah.

24:37.782 --> 24:39.125
I'm not very tempting.

24:39.145 --> 24:43.756
You know, get a bunch of the acrylic mascots.

24:44.056 --> 24:45.018
It's a lot of money.

24:46.792 --> 24:52.895
So, I think we'll just stick with the protagonist, the watermelon.

24:52.975 --> 24:54.496
BAU BAU!

24:54.936 --> 24:59.098
It's a very, very tickly, very dirty word.

24:59.559 --> 25:01.279
If you do it at someone, it would hurt.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.380
It would hurt.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.461
Let's not do that.

25:04.501 --> 25:04.781
BAU BAU!

25:08.463 --> 25:10.624
Hi, we're Ruffians!

25:11.344 --> 25:12.725
It's the beginning of the week.

25:13.325 --> 25:16.766
That means it's time to challenge something new!

25:17.366 --> 25:17.846
Yeah!

25:18.467 --> 25:31.651
So, just like every week up until now, Moco-chan, you're gonna do your best to challenge yourself to something that you're not very good at, and that's eating natto!

25:31.671 --> 25:32.872
Is what I want to say.

25:34.036 --> 25:38.578
But Moco-chan, I think you've already been doing a lot of challenging things this week.

25:38.978 --> 25:40.258
This past couple days.

25:40.778 --> 25:49.941
So today, Fuwawa's gonna eat the natto!

25:50.121 --> 25:52.062
Fuwawa is!

25:52.302 --> 25:53.002
I'm excited.

25:53.122 --> 25:55.403
It looks really delicious today.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.404
I know.

25:58.797 --> 26:04.701
You say something new, but... Is it new to have Mococo eat the natto anyways?

26:06.322 --> 26:08.303
You have to think about it like that, okay?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.866
I guess that's a way.

26:12.226 --> 26:15.648
It's a new challenge because usually I don't get to do this challenge!

26:17.129 --> 26:24.154
And today, the natto's friend is tired of the sauce that comes out of the sauce packet.

26:24.174 --> 26:26.956
It's not touchy.

26:27.475 --> 26:27.755
Yeah.

26:28.176 --> 26:28.856
But first!

26:29.717 --> 26:34.020
It's important before I challenge myself to enjoy this.

26:34.581 --> 26:36.843
I challenge to enjoy it!

26:37.663 --> 26:42.167
It's important first to say a big thank you to the farmers in Canada!

26:42.647 --> 26:44.669
And the United States of America!

26:44.729 --> 26:47.331
Who worked hard to make this natto.

26:48.012 --> 26:51.154
Itadakimasu!

26:51.374 --> 26:53.656
Moco-chan, once again, once again, once again.

26:53.676 --> 26:54.637
You watching, Moco-chan?

26:54.657 --> 26:55.137
You watching?

26:55.598 --> 26:55.898
Hi.

26:56.198 --> 26:56.919
My head hurts.

27:01.076 --> 27:02.319
Add ichimi!

27:03.522 --> 27:05.727
Oh, now it gets spicy though!

27:06.629 --> 27:07.932
Wow, it's so, so fresh!

27:18.285 --> 27:19.586
Mococo-chan, you watching?

27:20.206 --> 27:20.906
What happened?

27:20.986 --> 27:21.447
BAU BAU!

27:21.547 --> 27:25.109
Ruffians!

27:25.709 --> 27:28.551
I've seen you eat natto before, it's nothing new.

27:28.571 --> 27:31.732
Then why are you so bad at it, huh, Mococo-chan?

27:31.752 --> 27:35.674
It's not a watch and see thing.

27:36.195 --> 27:38.876
It's a try and improve kind of thing, right?

27:40.117 --> 27:43.378
BAU BAU!

27:44.939 --> 27:46.060
Was that another attempt?

27:46.920 --> 27:50.163
Yeah, because you've been attempting a bunch of challenging things.

27:50.723 --> 27:51.103
Yeah.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.746
I would say it's even better than last time.

27:54.947 --> 27:56.067
Yeah!

27:56.168 --> 27:58.229
Even if maybe things aren't quite one-to-one.

27:58.289 --> 27:58.670
BAU BAU!

27:59.070 --> 28:00.431
BAU BAU!

28:00.591 --> 28:07.917
Listen to Moco-chan's constant hard work and attempts at all the challenges!

28:10.981 --> 28:17.712
And let's use that to power ourselves through all the hard things that we have waiting that we need to face this time.

28:17.872 --> 28:21.458
Let's do our best, Ruffians!

28:21.518 --> 28:23.341
BAU BAU!

28:25.504 --> 28:31.266
Well, on to our regular corner, we have the Doggie of the Day!

28:31.467 --> 28:33.308
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

28:33.328 --> 28:33.988
De-den!

28:34.208 --> 28:38.090
The Doggie of the Day is Louie!

28:38.210 --> 28:39.571
Louie!

28:39.931 --> 28:42.172
He's so cute!

28:42.352 --> 28:44.313
Very pupper pupper.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.014
Yeah, pupper pupper.

28:46.054 --> 28:48.235
Look, so fluffy, so soft.

28:48.675 --> 28:51.156
Look like we just got a poof away.

28:52.577 --> 28:53.778
You know, Louie's still

28:54.338 --> 29:00.223
Fresh little puppy only one and a half years old.

29:01.064 --> 29:03.947
But Lily's been having a bit of a rough time making friends.

29:08.231 --> 29:09.873
Don't say anything, okay?

29:09.893 --> 29:14.477
We're already friends, got it.

29:14.678 --> 29:20.443
But I wanted the Ruffians, you know, really look so put together.

29:20.603 --> 29:24.307
Don't you kind of think you could play us a song on the piano?

29:25.404 --> 29:28.866
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

29:50.162 --> 29:51.283
Like that.

29:51.763 --> 29:54.044
As he plays the piano.

29:54.184 --> 29:56.125
A beautiful accompaniment.

29:56.165 --> 29:58.726
If you can't play the piano yet, listen.

30:01.923 --> 30:02.423
Beautiful!

30:02.443 --> 30:02.563
BAU!

30:02.804 --> 30:02.904
Yes!

30:03.364 --> 30:08.487
Lui is doing his best to become your best buddy!

30:08.987 --> 30:09.387
Yes!

30:09.588 --> 30:20.134
You know, part of that also includes getting a nice comfy seat in your suitcase because Lui wants to let you know that he wants to be by your side always and forever.

30:20.414 --> 30:24.897
As you know, maybe Lui can't play piano yet, but he's working towards it.

30:24.917 --> 30:25.557
I'm sure.

30:25.597 --> 30:25.877
Yeah.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.939
Anything to make you smile.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.602
BAU BAU!

30:34.203 --> 30:35.724
So cute.

30:36.424 --> 30:37.525
Ruffians!

30:38.085 --> 30:40.167
We've been going on walks, right?

30:40.427 --> 30:42.048
Seeing a bunch of different sights.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.329
What's this called?

30:44.069 --> 30:46.271
Today, I went for a walk.

30:48.532 --> 30:49.873
Went on a walk!

30:50.374 --> 30:51.514
BAU BAU!

30:54.857 --> 30:58.761
Amazing radio tower!

30:58.781 --> 31:02.065
It looks magnificent.

31:02.966 --> 31:04.307
Why was it abandoned?

31:04.667 --> 31:07.770
It could have been a planetarium, right?

31:08.451 --> 31:10.413
This is not a planetarium.

31:10.753 --> 31:11.935
It's a radio tower.

31:13.416 --> 31:18.958
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

31:33.764 --> 31:35.286
Right, look at that blue sky.

31:35.306 --> 31:38.210
What a nice memory.

31:38.570 --> 31:40.392
BAU BAU!

31:40.572 --> 31:45.358
I wanna see an abandoned radio tower now too.

31:46.059 --> 31:47.761
BAU BAU!

31:48.321 --> 31:51.805
And next for our Question of the Day we have... De-den!

31:53.266 --> 31:56.727
I'm such a big fan.

31:57.087 --> 31:58.868
I love you girls so much.

32:00.388 --> 32:01.969
As for my Question of the Day.

32:02.449 --> 32:08.971
What's a heartwarming or memorable moment from your life that always brings a smile to your face when you think about it?

32:08.991 --> 32:14.072
There's been so many.

32:14.092 --> 32:17.453
It's hard to choose one.

32:18.573 --> 32:20.514
But I think

32:22.543 --> 32:31.266
You know, one moment that always kind of makes us laugh was when we received our N64 from Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy.

32:31.306 --> 32:33.306
Yeah, right.

32:34.207 --> 32:34.887
Yeah.

32:35.227 --> 32:40.149
They told us that we had to help pull a huge pile of laundry.

32:40.249 --> 32:40.589
Yeah.

32:40.729 --> 32:41.869
It was taller than us.

32:42.129 --> 32:45.110
You know, normally we'd love to help out.

32:45.210 --> 32:49.352
But it was just so big of a pile that we were sort of overwhelmed.

32:50.692 --> 32:53.874
My baby started to cry a bit while folding.

32:53.954 --> 32:54.114
Yeah.

32:54.194 --> 33:00.538
We know only to find out that Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy were hiding an N64 in there.

33:00.738 --> 33:01.198
Yeah.

33:01.779 --> 33:04.580
And that's why I left such a big pile.

33:04.841 --> 33:06.702
Because it wasn't just folding.

33:07.042 --> 33:07.322
No.

33:07.582 --> 33:10.024
We were hiding something special.

33:10.464 --> 33:10.924
Yeah.

33:11.104 --> 33:12.665
It's so silly, right?

33:13.166 --> 33:16.288
But it's a really precious memory.

33:16.328 --> 33:16.508
Yeah.

33:17.426 --> 33:23.398
Unfortunately, a precious memory that Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy both have no recollection of.

33:23.719 --> 33:24.420
I wonder why.

33:26.752 --> 33:28.173
Moco-chan, it happened, right?

33:28.293 --> 33:28.833
It happened.

33:28.853 --> 33:29.454
It happened.

33:30.034 --> 33:30.395
Yeah.

33:30.735 --> 33:31.535
We remember.

33:31.575 --> 33:31.956
Yeah.

33:32.736 --> 33:34.538
BAU BAU!

33:34.558 --> 33:42.703
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your questions, your doggy of the days, your walks.

33:43.424 --> 33:47.467
And Pero Sighting, please make sure you keep your eyes open for Pero.

33:47.507 --> 33:50.889
Yeah, you never know when he's gonna show up, okay?

33:50.909 --> 33:50.969
And...

33:52.250 --> 33:59.500
If you happen to see him, make sure you use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

34:00.140 --> 34:02.924
We'll be waiting to see what you see.

34:02.984 --> 34:05.387
BAU BAU!

34:05.488 --> 34:08.832
For our next team, we have De-den!

34:10.354 --> 34:12.315
Super chat meeting!

34:12.735 --> 34:14.697
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:15.077 --> 34:20.441
We're really looking forward to being able to chat a bit this time.

34:20.701 --> 34:25.785
We know that there's been some super chats that we've been meaning to read for a while.

34:25.805 --> 34:28.968
I've been getting a little bit older, a little bit gray.

34:29.808 --> 34:32.950
But thank you for waiting patiently for us, Ruffians.

34:33.430 --> 34:37.892
We're looking forward to chatting!

34:37.932 --> 34:38.232
BAU BAU!

34:38.272 --> 34:39.153
Thank you!

34:39.313 --> 34:41.254
And for our schedule!

34:41.274 --> 34:48.257
Our schedule this week, unfortunately, you know with Moco-chan's migraine and everything, we weren't able to present this to you earlier.

34:48.557 --> 34:50.378
But here's our schedule!

34:50.398 --> 34:55.060
After our Super Chat meeting on the next day, Tuesday, it's a very, very

34:55.340 --> 35:01.147
We're nervous, but we're gonna do our all, okay?

35:01.508 --> 35:05.252
So please send us lots of good vibes, okay?

35:05.492 --> 35:09.117
And then on Wednesday we have FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:09.257 --> 35:12.040
And after that, FUWAMOCO, more homework.

35:15.776 --> 35:17.057
We couldn't do our best.

35:17.598 --> 35:20.981
And then on Thursday we have a collab all together with Alvin.

35:21.002 --> 35:23.344
We're playing a game called School of Alvin.

35:23.684 --> 35:26.848
Does this mean we get to go to school with Alvin?

35:28.309 --> 35:30.612
I think before I thought it was a different game.

35:31.092 --> 35:34.396
Are you scared now Mococo-chan?

35:34.416 --> 35:35.237
I'm concerned.

35:36.499 --> 35:37.719
Let's see how it goes!

35:37.859 --> 35:39.700
What will we learn at school lab?

35:39.740 --> 35:43.000
BAU BAU!

35:43.020 --> 35:50.822
And on Friday, over on Koyori-senpai's channel, we're gonna be having an off club with her!

35:50.982 --> 35:53.523
Our first off club with JP-senpai!

35:53.843 --> 35:57.003
We're gonna be doing karaoke with Koyori-senpai.

35:57.044 --> 36:03.605
And then over here, like we mentioned, we're having FUWAMOCO Morning with a very special guest, Koyori-senpai!

36:05.567 --> 36:09.990
It'll be really exciting to see what kind of silly things we get up to all together.

36:10.411 --> 36:11.432
You'll be partying now.

36:12.793 --> 36:22.041
And then, afterwards in the evening, we're gonna be starting our own FUWAMOCO Minecraft channel.

36:22.262 --> 36:26.085
You know I mentioned that now we both have one computer each.

36:26.445 --> 36:27.907
So this means that both

36:28.507 --> 36:32.111
Moco-chan and I, we can go and learn Minecraft!

36:32.131 --> 36:39.179
Yeah, we can get our paws into the block world of Minecraft and find out just what it's like.

36:39.319 --> 36:40.741
What do the blocks make, huh?

36:40.781 --> 36:41.061
Yeah.

36:41.542 --> 36:49.570
But we'll definitely need a lot of help from you, Ruffians, so we hope we'll have a really fun start of our Minecraft journey together.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.352
BAU BAU!

36:51.852 --> 36:55.335
And on Saturday, you know we have holo Dorokei coming up.

36:55.735 --> 36:59.478
And I think we should practice a little bit, otherwise we're definitely gonna get caught.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.840
So, we're gonna practice a little bit.

37:02.280 --> 37:07.785
But, after that, in the evening, we have our FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

37:08.105 --> 37:12.909
We were so, so excited to be able to sing some of our favorite anime songs with you.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.651
But then, things didn't go quite as planned.

37:16.331 --> 37:17.853
Don't really have control over...

37:18.894 --> 37:20.255
Migrancia.

37:20.655 --> 37:25.839
But it's okay because we're gonna have even more fun this weekend on Saturday.

37:26.279 --> 37:32.303
And then on Sunday, we have the Day of the Big Horodoroki!

37:32.643 --> 37:35.505
And we're gonna do our best to escape Travis Yamadori.

37:38.667 --> 37:38.967
BAU BAU!

37:39.268 --> 37:45.571
And that's our schedule for this week!

37:45.631 --> 37:50.535
Thank you Ruffians!

37:51.155 --> 37:57.919
And for Ruffians who are joining us through the iCountry, here is your FUWAMOCO would win!

37:58.600 --> 37:58.860
It's...

37:59.680 --> 38:00.380
BAU BAU!

38:00.480 --> 38:02.101
Eternal Morning!

38:02.201 --> 38:04.441
BAU BAU!

38:04.581 --> 38:07.002
Thank you, Ruffians!

38:07.882 --> 38:09.562
BAU BAU!

38:09.942 --> 38:13.603
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning.

38:13.883 --> 38:17.704
We hope it's gonna be an amazing week for all of us.

38:17.744 --> 38:18.924
Let's make it that way, okay?

38:19.344 --> 38:25.805
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians.

38:26.446 --> 38:27.286
Extra!

38:27.506 --> 38:28.126

38:28.846 --> 38:30.226

38:30.266 --> 38:31.007

38:31.227 --> 38:32.607
BAU BAU!

38:48.814 --> 38:56.720
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

38:56.960 --> 39:01.383
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

39:01.403 --> 39:02.905
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

39:03.225 --> 39:04.526
