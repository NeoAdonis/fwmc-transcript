00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.633
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:11.574
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.302
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:25.464
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:27.305
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:30.227
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:35.070
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.971
Both of you, good morning!

00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.011
Good morning!

00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.933
Thank you for joining us today for our 128th episode!

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:41.814
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:43.475
128 episodes.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:52.019
That's a lot of episodes!

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:52.179
BAU BAU!

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.940
Hi!

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.162
Morning!

00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:57.102
Wow!

00:05:57.182 --> 00:05:58.043
Hi Ruffians!

00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:01.164
Maybe today isn't your 128th FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:01.184 --> 00:06:02.225
Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:04.486
Maybe it's not yours, but it's ours.

00:06:04.506 --> 00:06:10.129
Is there any Ruffians that... It is their 128th episode!

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:12.070
I should've done that.

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:15.996
You!

00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:16.797
You're new!

00:06:16.817 --> 00:06:18.559
You're so Ruffians!

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.981
You, yes!

00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:23.026
I'll put down the windows.

00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:27.292
What if you're here for the beginning but then you fall back asleep halfway through?

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:28.333
Does that count?

00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.563
That's a discussion for another time, I think.

00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.165
We need more science to prove so.

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:46.314
Well, for those that are joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:46.654 --> 00:06:47.355
A.K.A.

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:48.476
FUWAMOCAR!

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:49.697
Hosted by us!

00:06:50.297 --> 00:06:51.619
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:57.104
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:03.090
Or, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:07.074
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:07.755
BAU BAU!

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.319
Ruffians!

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:18.522
I was wondering if there's any Ruffians that are doing this for all 128 episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.003
So fun!

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.564
Do you say the intro together with us?

00:07:23.584 --> 00:07:27.206
That's a good question.

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:27.726
Why?

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:31.068
I think there's a lot of science that needs to be done in this episode, huh?

00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:31.768
I think so.

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:33.129
You missed a single episode!

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:34.330
That's okay.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:38.677
Thank you!

00:07:38.737 --> 00:07:43.781
Thank you for always being here to start your days off together with us, Ruffians!

00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:50.686
Where's FUWAMOCO morning today without Ruffians?

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.889
BAU BAU!

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.190
Let's start it off!

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.591
Our weekend's just about to start!

00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:57.432
It's Friday!

00:07:57.512 --> 00:07:59.093
It's gonna be a good day!

00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:02.156
Except... We have bad news.

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:05.056
You can ask questions or we can take a look!

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:05.156
Hi!

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:32.451
We have ice cream muffins!

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:42.197
Yeah, some delicious mochi ice cream on one side and... What do we do, Ruffians?

00:08:42.978 --> 00:08:45.179
Do we just close our eyes and eat them?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.701
We could!

00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:50.083
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.888

00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:57.629

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.271
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.552
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:19.877
I think he's got bones, right?

00:09:19.957 --> 00:09:21.138
Can't eat him.

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:26.979
Mochi ice cream with something extra special in the middle.

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.059
Maybe the Ruffians don't want to eat Pero.

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:32.559
You can go ahead and I'll have the other one on the other side.

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:34.440
Yeah, we'll skip eating weird stuff.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.360
Yeah, you know, he's probably just gonna taste nasty like garbage.

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.701
He might be sort of stretchy like mochi though, huh?

00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:46.642
Ruffians that decide to eat him could tell us how he tastes.

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:50.943
Have you been giving him that much pudding, Ruffians?

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.368
I don't think so.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.773
Well, it's a doggy dog world out there, huh?

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:17.918
BAU BAU!

00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.840
Now I want ice cream.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.961
Mochi ice cream.

00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:21.782
You give me that?

00:10:21.842 --> 00:10:23.204
I can't eat ice cream!

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:24.665
Please stay in the morning!

00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:26.187
It's the rules.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.048
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.990
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:38.694
Actually recently, we hit a really exciting milestone!

00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:44.758
After all the whole GTA silliness and everything, FUWAMOCO!

00:10:45.138 --> 00:10:47.620
We've reached 960,000 Ruffians here on YouTube!

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.622
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:53.543 --> 00:10:56.327
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:56.627 --> 00:11:02.574
That's only 40,000 Ruffians away from our big dream of 1 million subscribers here on YouTube!

00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:03.415
Wow!

00:11:03.816 --> 00:11:05.017
So close!

00:11:05.118 --> 00:11:10.684
I can't believe that, you know, we're getting so close to having such a massive day, everybody's come cheering!

00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:13.948
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:11:13.988 --> 00:11:17.590
Thank you so much for joining us on our journey so far.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:24.476
As you know, we're sure that we'll be able to do some even more amazing things after we hit our 1 million goal.

00:11:24.896 --> 00:11:30.640
So let's continue to have lots of fun and try new things here while we're at it, you know?

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:32.282
Thank you!

00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:34.083
Thank you just a little bit!

00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:36.725
Mama Puppy, when?

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:38.787
We already said 5 million.

00:11:40.994 --> 00:11:41.414
That's it!

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.015
That's right.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.973
She's like, it was really nice, I had a lot of fun!

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.796
She's so happy, she's like, I got to get to see you!

00:12:12.747 --> 00:12:13.327
Yeah.

00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:13.807
Yeah.

00:12:13.847 --> 00:12:16.748
She saw you, yeah.

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:18.249
She saw you, Moco.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:18.929
Yeah, yeah!

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:22.070
Yeah, Moco will be the five million.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.671
Five million, okay?

00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:24.051
Got it!

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:27.652
But once we hit one million, we're not so far away anymore.

00:12:27.672 --> 00:12:27.832
No!

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.973
We're only one fifth of the way there.

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:38.160
Ruffians, you might think it's sort of silly, this sort of stuff, but things like this are important, okay?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.622
So continue working hard!

00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:45.206
To our big dream of 1 million Ruffians here on YouTube!

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:46.166
BAU BAU!

00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:49.169
Thank you!

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.951
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:53.472
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:12.077
BAU BAU!

00:13:12.097 --> 00:13:12.157
Wow!

00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:16.060
More exciting news!

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:29.308
You know, the very cool original timeline senpai from Promise, Orvokroni, she just released a brand new original song called Soten ni Muyuu!

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:30.809
BAU BAU!

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.750
Look at it!

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.431
It's so cool!

00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:35.853
Kroni-senpai.

00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:37.796
Oh my gosh.

00:13:38.277 --> 00:13:38.637
Wow.

00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:49.409
It's a really cool song where you can kind of see here, but Mori-senpai, she's gonna splash her way through things like a samurai through all the danger that comes her way.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.372
Yeah, and it has a really sharp vibe to it.

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:53.133
Like a sword.

00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:54.455
Yeah, like a sword.

00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:56.177
The lyrics are super cool.

00:13:56.477 --> 00:14:01.821
I think they were really tricky, and especially, you know, there's an explosive rap portion to the song, too.

00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.483
So you really need to go check it out!

00:14:04.523 --> 00:14:06.704
Japanese lyrics, too.

00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:08.986
Konomi-senpai, she did her best.

00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:16.031
Yeah, but you know, it's nice to finally be able to listen to it like this, in case you remember it.

00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:17.092
Oh, I remember.

00:14:18.092 --> 00:14:18.713
We've been waiting.

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:19.876
We've been waiting.

00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:21.176
Kronii-senpai!

00:14:21.477 --> 00:14:24.057
She first revealed her song during Connect the World!

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:25.217
I was so excited!

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:25.838
What's this?

00:14:26.038 --> 00:14:28.838
Is this an original song?

00:14:29.398 --> 00:14:29.919
Yeah!

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:30.799
But now!

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:32.419
You know her English first concert.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.419
Yeah, Connect the World.

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.840
Not Breaking the Magic, Connect the World.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.840
Connect the World!

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.500
But now!

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.941
Now so ten million years out, we can listen to it!

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:45.522
Yeah, and you know apparently Kronii-senpai's been working on it for a long time.

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:48.503
Since around even debut for her, too.

00:14:49.243 --> 00:14:52.048
So, please go take a listen to it, okay?

00:14:52.128 --> 00:14:53.911
As you know, it's all her hard work.

00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.395
It's finally come to fruition.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:00.534
So please go take a listen.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:04.395
Ah, congratulations Kronii-senpai!

00:15:04.435 --> 00:15:06.055
Congratulations!

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.996
BAU BAU!

00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:11.217
Officials are so cool too.

00:15:11.297 --> 00:15:15.038
It takes a lot to release an original song, okay Ruffians?

00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:15.779
BAU BAU!

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.843
Wow, we also wanted to share something today, Ruffians!

00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:29.666
You know how hard we work at Voice Pack, right?

00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:32.968
We have a cool fact to share with you!

00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:34.670
FUWAMOCO!

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:40.714
We've participated in every Voice Pack we could on since debut!

00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:44.056
That's pretty amazing, right?

00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:45.337
Every single one!

00:15:47.971 --> 00:15:48.912
Thank you!

00:15:50.094 --> 00:15:57.882
You know voice packs, it's a lot of fun but it's a lot of hard work too!

00:15:58.122 --> 00:16:01.205
Yeah you know we really enjoy it and we want to get better at it too!

00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:03.508
You know we put a lot of effort into it.

00:16:04.048 --> 00:16:05.249
And the scripts and everything as well.

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.770
Yeah, yeah, the scripts as well.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.112
Yeah, and maybe there's a few Ruffians that haven't listened to a voice buff before.

00:16:11.132 --> 00:16:12.413
It can be really confusing.

00:16:12.433 --> 00:16:14.614
Sometimes it can be a bit difficult to find them, too.

00:16:14.854 --> 00:16:15.475
Oh, yeah.

00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:18.597
But you can find them on the official hololive shop!

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:18.737
Yeah!

00:16:19.037 --> 00:16:21.979
They're very similar to what, like, a drama CD would be for an anime.

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:23.659
What's a drama CD though?

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:27.942
You know, you have all the characters talking and a special scenario.

00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:31.124
Music, sound effects, very immersive.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.125
But it's only something that you can listen to.

00:16:33.245 --> 00:16:35.368
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:49.884
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:49.984 --> 00:16:51.625
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:18.979
Wow.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.762
I think it was kind of popular amongst the Ruffians, I wonder why.

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:23.463
But!

00:17:23.703 --> 00:17:29.347
It will actually be ending in sale period at the end of this month, so only a few days left, Ruffians!

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:30.427
May, May soon!

00:17:30.547 --> 00:17:31.288
Yeah.

00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:34.931
They're not on sale forever, okay?

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.913
Not forever, you might think that, but that's not the case.

00:17:38.353 --> 00:17:43.216
Yeah, and, well, this was the first voice pack of FUWAMOCO that we did together!

00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:45.178
Yeah, and, you know...

00:17:45.938 --> 00:17:50.042
That means it's a Tomb Raider voice pack, right?

00:17:51.783 --> 00:17:52.103
Yes!

00:17:52.924 --> 00:17:57.307
You can't explain what getting married to FUWAMOCO is like in this voice pack!

00:17:57.508 --> 00:17:58.769
BAU BAU!

00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:00.991
Again and again!

00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:05.834
There's some really silly moments at times, so you won't want to miss a Ruffian.

00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:07.916
It's a bit silly, huh?

00:18:09.538 --> 00:18:10.598
Yeah.

00:18:10.638 --> 00:18:13.541
There's another popular one that's brand new!

00:18:15.102 --> 00:18:17.363
Dream Love Voice Pack.

00:18:17.823 --> 00:18:19.143
They're not all like this!

00:18:19.203 --> 00:18:24.085
They're not all like this, this is just the two that happened to be highlighted today.

00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:31.268
But this time, you can hear both a very scary yandere, Fuwawa and Mococo.

00:18:32.908 --> 00:18:40.051
Ruffians, what kind of things do you think would make Fuwawa and Mococo into yandere?

00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:43.612
Apparently, plushie dog.

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:55.210
Please go and find out, take a listen to it, and then you'll be able to see the real demon dog behind FUWAMOCO.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:01.897
Apparently some wolfies were very terrified, so please take a school day flashback or howl.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:07.023
I know you don't really get to hear the very very yawning points in the sample, so...

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.665
You'll have to check it out at FUWAMOCO!

00:19:10.685 --> 00:19:12.927
We'll continue to do our best with our voice packs.

00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:15.489
So please cheer us on, Ruffians!

00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:17.731
We're so happy that you enjoy them so much!

00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:19.132
Thank you!

00:19:19.372 --> 00:19:21.474
BAU BAU!

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:25.828
I feel like today is for good news, good news, good news!

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:29.409
Yeah!

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:29.810
And we have even more good news!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.300
There was something super happy that happened.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.000
And I think maybe a lot of Ruffians might not have noticed?

00:19:38.454 --> 00:19:39.694
Yeah!

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:47.737
But Ruffians, there's a new, very tiny Ruffian amongst us now!

00:19:47.777 --> 00:19:50.537
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:19:50.577 --> 00:19:53.238
This Ruffian, Abyssgard!

00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:55.259
Congratulations, Sobbi!

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.841
Congratulations, BAU BAU!

00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:04.244
I'm so happy!

00:20:04.264 --> 00:20:07.266
Right? We can't wait to hear his first BAU BAU!

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.067
Abbysgard's first BAU BAU. I'm sure it'll be super cute!

00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:16.312
Before you know it, you'll be off to a first day of kindergarten!

00:20:16.352 --> 00:20:19.033
They grow up really fast, huh?

00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:23.236
Yeah, you'll definitely be the coolest kid in class with that name you know.

00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:30.000
Fuwawa Abyssgard, Mococo Abyssgard and.. Abyssgard!

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:37.345
But you might not want to mess with him, or there might be EXTREME VIOLENCE!

00:20:39.353 --> 00:20:41.796
It's a misunderstanding?

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:42.417
Huh?

00:20:43.338 --> 00:20:43.739
What?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.281
What?

00:20:45.902 --> 00:20:47.023
Misunderstanding?

00:20:47.043 --> 00:20:50.208
What do you mean, Ruffians?

00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:53.585
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding...

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.547
Little brother!

00:20:55.727 --> 00:21:00.031
Little brother!

00:21:00.451 --> 00:21:03.053
Congratulations on the brother! Not child.

00:21:03.153 --> 00:21:07.637
It's just a joke.

00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:13.442
We hope you have tons of fun together with your brother Abyssgard!

00:21:13.462 --> 00:21:16.404
You know, definitely teach him how to draw lots and lots of keys!

00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:18.166
Yeah, maybe you can dress him up as Pero too. 

00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:24.000
It would be cute, not nasty.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.000
Maybe just this once.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.500
BAU BAU! Have lots of fun with your brother Abbysgard! BAU BAU!

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.711
He will get bigger eventually, right?

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:40.592
They grow fast.

00:21:40.892 --> 00:21:44.594
BAU BAU!

00:21:44.654 --> 00:21:48.396
You know how much we love to sing right, Ruffians?

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:53.678
And well, it's not just FUWAMOCO that loves to sing, but all of Advent!

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:58.360
And because of that and a bunch of other things, we released another song cover!

00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:02.382
Altogether, all five of us, all of Advent!

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:03.123
We released...

00:22:03.983 --> 00:22:10.147
Weegloss' first debut original song, Silicone Heart Beat!

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:13.389
You know, all to celebrate the first anniversary.

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:16.331
Weegloss' first anniversary!

00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:18.933
Yeah, it's so good!

00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:20.614
Please take a listen to it.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:24.216
It's on the hololive English Official Channel.

00:22:24.236 --> 00:22:29.420
And in the cover here, I get to sing Lydian Sky and Moco-chan.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.961
I get Bibika's part!

00:22:31.981 --> 00:22:33.361
Yeah, it was so much fun.

00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:35.002
It's such a catchy song.

00:22:35.162 --> 00:22:36.402
The lyrics are really fun to sing.

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:38.243
Especially the end, it was kind of tricky.

00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:40.324
It was very tricky at the end.

00:22:40.344 --> 00:22:40.604
Right.

00:22:40.624 --> 00:22:49.287
But please go take a look at the lesson over... You can compare them, you know?

00:22:49.587 --> 00:22:51.688
This is how Almond does it.

00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:55.570
I definitely put my own sort of flair into it.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.491
Right, right.

00:22:56.511 --> 00:22:57.171
Me and Mococo.

00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:59.653
I'm sure all of Advent was like that.

00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:01.474
So please go take a listen.

00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:04.756
And, well, it's Weegloss' first anniversary.

00:23:04.796 --> 00:23:06.537
But there's a lot going on.

00:23:06.797 --> 00:23:09.339
It's not only their first anniversary.

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:13.061
No, a big, big, big, big thing is happening.

00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:18.545
Weegloss' 3D debut live is happening tomorrow at 4AM PDT.

00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:27.215
FUWAMOCO we really want to be there live to be able to congratulate them.

00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:31.860
So we're doing a watch-along together with Biboo on our channel here.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.184
We'll be doing a watch-along.

00:23:39.008 --> 00:23:48.297
I know it's very early in the morning for some Ruffians, but we hope that maybe you can check it out along with us and some glossers too!

00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:52.080
Yeah, we want to be able to congratulate them all together!

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:58.326
Yeah, and then, you know, this way we'll be able to see Free Gloss's first steps in 3D as a music group too!

00:23:58.426 --> 00:23:59.667
Yeah, exciting!

00:23:59.847 --> 00:24:00.928
Yeah, 4AM!

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.751
BAU BAU!

00:24:24.543 --> 00:24:28.244
It's time for the Doggie of the Day!

00:24:28.304 --> 00:24:31.025
Let's check out who exactly the Doggie of the Day is.

00:24:31.045 --> 00:24:33.025
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:52.423
Look!

00:24:52.683 --> 00:24:54.784
Oh my gosh, he's so fluffy!

00:24:54.844 --> 00:24:56.905
So fluffy with a big nose!

00:24:56.925 --> 00:25:01.808
I feel like it has to be a rule that you have to push the nose.

00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:01.948
Why?

00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:03.689
It's like a button.

00:25:03.949 --> 00:25:04.950
Yeah!

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.172
Yeah, Bandit looks like a real-life Garibaldi, right?

00:25:09.292 --> 00:25:09.852
Yeah, Garibaldi!

00:25:09.892 --> 00:25:11.553
Garibaldi, Garibaldi, Garibaldi!

00:25:11.573 --> 00:25:13.034
No, this isn't Garibaldi!

00:25:13.414 --> 00:25:14.915
It's Bandit!

00:25:15.075 --> 00:25:16.075
Yeah!

00:25:16.095 --> 00:25:17.616
He just looks alike, huh?

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:23.160
I'm so happy to wake up to that face right in my face!

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:31.407
Yeah, maybe Bandit has a nice spider costume, or maybe that's gonna be Bandit's Halloween costume!

00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:35.150
That would be very cute, but I don't think Bandit needs that to be cute.

00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:38.072
Bandit's already cute.

00:25:38.853 --> 00:25:40.575
BAU BAU!

00:25:40.835 --> 00:25:42.436
Who does Bandit BAU BAU?

00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:43.577
Moco-chan!

00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:45.178
BAU BAU!

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:46.940
BAU BAU!

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.500
Wow wow!

00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:52.681
I like that!

00:25:54.382 --> 00:25:56.322
It's a little bit younger than I thought.

00:25:56.362 --> 00:25:56.963
Younger?

00:25:57.003 --> 00:25:57.623
Yeah.

00:25:58.403 --> 00:25:59.503
It's very cute though.

00:26:00.484 --> 00:26:01.664
Are you saying I'm wrong?

00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:08.106
I don't know, it could be like... I don't know about that.

00:26:09.046 --> 00:26:10.767
We'll have to disagree, huh?

00:26:11.307 --> 00:26:11.807
It's okay.

00:26:13.142 --> 00:26:16.185
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:28.663
I love you.

00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:32.841
That's what's going on in Bandit's head!

00:26:32.881 --> 00:26:36.767
Because, you know, Bandit is a very distinguished gentleman, you know?

00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:42.857
And he's just always thinking about how to make you smile even more!

00:26:43.338 --> 00:26:43.939
Thank you, Bandit.

00:26:43.959 --> 00:26:47.906
Thank you, Bandit.

00:26:48.186 --> 00:26:48.767
BAU BAU!

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:49.648
BAU BAU!

00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:53.595
And now, we have what today I've read.

00:26:55.338 --> 00:26:58.880
I feel like that's the first time I've ever heard it be delivered like that.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.822
Today, I went on a walk.

00:27:02.182 --> 00:27:03.483
Finally perfected it, maybe?

00:27:03.543 --> 00:27:04.424
May we go.

00:27:04.444 --> 00:27:09.287
Let's take a look where Ruffians have been going for walks, huh?

00:27:09.447 --> 00:27:10.047
Okay!

00:27:10.187 --> 00:27:13.890
De-den!

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.070
Komorebi!

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.591
Yay!

00:27:16.751 --> 00:27:18.392
My favorite Japanese word!

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:19.913
The light's going through the trees.

00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:20.634
You see it?

00:27:20.674 --> 00:27:22.335
The sort of the...

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:24.219
Sunbeam is there.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.740
Yeah, Komorebeam.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.824
Yeah, it looks like you have such a nice and comfy walk.

00:27:30.164 --> 00:27:31.005
Very nice.

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:32.646
I feel like I can smell it.

00:27:32.946 --> 00:27:34.127
Right, I can hear it.

00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:34.587
Yeah.

00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:37.170
Wow, I like this walk that you went on.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.553
It looks a little bit cool too, like it's still sunny, but colder.

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:43.615
Like relaxing, refreshing.

00:27:44.375 --> 00:27:45.696
Very good work.

00:27:46.256 --> 00:27:57.862
It's a little bit bittersweet, but we're sure that that scenery will be changing colors, changing dramatically very shortly, so... Let's enjoy it while we can!

00:27:58.282 --> 00:28:05.505
We're sure you're gonna have to get back out there and see just how it's changed really soon, so... Have fun looking!

00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:06.446
Have fun!

00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:07.886
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:08.226
FUWAMOCO!

00:28:09.107 --> 00:28:10.988
And for our Question of the Day!

00:28:11.468 --> 00:28:12.789
We have... De-den!

00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:17.310
Good morning FUWAMOCO!

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.792
Something I've always paid close attention for is how you both move in 3D.

00:28:23.112 --> 00:28:27.213
Especially how you both seem to enjoy making your ears and tails move!

00:28:27.693 --> 00:28:28.873
Isn't really fun?

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:33.074
What other aspects of your 3D models do you enjoy the most?

00:28:33.595 --> 00:28:34.455
BAU BAU!

00:28:42.824 --> 00:28:48.490
A little bit nervous, but I feel like it was really seamless going from my 2D bodies to my 3D bodies first.

00:28:51.773 --> 00:29:06.240
You know, we're still getting used to things, doing our best, but we really, you know, we hope that we'll have lots of opportunities to be able to show our 3D souls to you lots and, you know, bounce around here and there!

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.102
It's just really fun!

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:17.585
I think everything about it is our favorite, so... Did you look forward to that, Ruffians?

00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:20.368
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:20.848 --> 00:29:24.112
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:29:35.566 --> 00:29:41.949
Thank you Ruffians!

00:29:42.069 --> 00:29:45.051
Thank you so much for all your submissions!

00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:47.012
Do you have a question for us?

00:29:47.232 --> 00:29:49.173
I bet you have a question for us.

00:29:49.353 --> 00:29:54.135
Please let us know your questions with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:57.597
Also if you happen to see Pero, please let us know.

00:29:58.057 --> 00:29:59.378
You know, it's kinda nasty.

00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:00.438
It's serious.

00:30:00.478 --> 00:30:03.340
It's important to let all the Ruffians know where he has been.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:09.682
Also your walks, you know, now it's really getting much cooler outside so it's a good time of year to take a walk.

00:30:09.742 --> 00:30:09.842
Yeah!

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:10.783
Very relaxing!

00:30:11.804 --> 00:30:16.650
And if you happen to see a fluffy or fuzzy dog, please let us know!

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.273
It might become the Doggie of the Day!

00:30:19.293 --> 00:30:20.354
BAU BAU!

00:30:20.414 --> 00:30:22.736
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:30:23.337 --> 00:30:26.440
And next, we have another stream coming up.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.161
Very soon!

00:30:27.301 --> 00:30:29.303
We have De-den!

00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:31.707
Team Fortress 2!

00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:40.358
We're gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 for the very first time with a bunch of our hololive members!

00:30:42.782 --> 00:30:44.023
Oh, maybe.

00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:44.663
Ice cream.

00:30:44.684 --> 00:30:51.248
Yeah, Ami-senpai is having a very special Valve Game Manathon day today.

00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:58.253
So we're gonna be playing a part, being a part, playing together with everybody, a part of the celebration.

00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.315
Ami, are we construction workers with guns?

00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:02.596
I don't know.

00:31:03.317 --> 00:31:03.717
Mayo?

00:31:04.378 --> 00:31:04.778
Mayo?

00:31:05.178 --> 00:31:05.718
Mayo-man?

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:06.779
I don't know.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:07.940
I don't know.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.713
I don't know what to expect.

00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:19.814
I think there's guns involved though.

00:31:20.615 --> 00:31:23.076
I would think that there's guns involved but maybe hard hats.

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:23.717
I don't know.

00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:25.458
I think we're gonna be part of a team.

00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:28.039
Defending a fortress.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.563
For the second time!

00:31:32.603 --> 00:31:38.409
We'll do our best and have a bunch of fun together with everybody and Ame-senpai!

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.571
BAU BAU!

00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:42.573
And our schedule!

00:31:43.054 --> 00:31:44.555
Well, not just Team Fortress 2.

00:31:45.156 --> 00:31:46.097
Later on!

00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:53.422
At around 7pm PT, we'll be playing Gary's Mod over on Abyss Senpai's channel!

00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:55.163
So make sure you don't forget.

00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:55.803
Don't forget.

00:31:55.843 --> 00:31:57.004
Oh, Team Fortress 2 is done.

00:31:57.084 --> 00:31:57.985
Oh, that's everything.

00:31:58.185 --> 00:31:59.966
Cuz that is not everything, not at all.

00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:03.989
Abyss Senpai has a bunch more games going over on her channel.

00:32:04.049 --> 00:32:05.810
Yes, it is a marathon.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:12.274
And then we'll be back for Gary's Mod, so please join everybody in a really fun celebration.

00:32:12.334 --> 00:32:15.677
And then it's not on the schedule, but after that, we have our

00:32:16.297 --> 00:32:19.080
We glossed 3D life much along.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.506
But that's obviously very very early in the morning so please make sure you put your sleep first, okay my friends?

00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:30.191
Because, after that, we're gonna be having a Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:32:30.232 --> 00:32:35.797
So it, so it, officially comes to an end when we finish the last song, the encore.

00:32:36.758 --> 00:32:37.759
Maybe we deserve an encore.

00:32:37.819 --> 00:32:41.321
I'm not a chihuahua, but maybe if we do so, we touch your heart.

00:32:41.341 --> 00:32:46.724
And if we have a lot of fun that you think we deserve an encore, then I'd be really happy to be able to end summer with an encore, but I don't know.

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:51.686
So we're gonna sing a lot of songs and have a lot of fun, so please join us, Ruffians!

00:32:52.427 --> 00:32:53.287
I'm so excited.

00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:56.549
It's been a little while since the last Welcome Board Party.

00:32:56.569 --> 00:32:58.790
It's been a lot going on.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.413
So, let's end the summer with a big, big BAU Showcase!

00:33:03.473 --> 00:33:05.554
BAU BAU!

00:33:06.475 --> 00:33:09.217
Well, now we have a whole new day, so we're gonna do our best that day.

00:33:09.597 --> 00:33:09.957
But!

00:33:10.297 --> 00:33:15.741

00:33:37.528 --> 00:33:39.169
It will be starting on Monday.

00:33:39.229 --> 00:33:39.690

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.291
Yeah, don't get confused.
