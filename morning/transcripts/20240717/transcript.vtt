00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:08.018
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.161
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:13.982
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:18.364
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:19.785
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:21.406
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:21.926
BAU BAU!

00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:35.826
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:37.931
Moco-chan!

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:40.675
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.756 --> 00:05:44.297
Thank you for waking up.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:45.037
For waiting up?

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.358
For waking up!

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:47.978
Or staying up late?

00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:49.759
Maybe waiting up late.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:57.262
And joining us for our 107th episode today, Ruffians!

00:05:57.282 --> 00:05:59.663
BAU BAU!

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:03.125
It's the middle of the week, Ruffians.

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.706
How are you feeling?

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.247
Are you ready to go?

00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:09.087
Maybe not yet.

00:06:10.652 --> 00:06:14.657
Ruffians!

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.185
I think I see some new faces out there!

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.869
So maybe that means today is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.511
Maybe it is!

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:27.392
Let me explain!

00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:34.175
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:34.995
A.k.a.

00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:36.095
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:39.476
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:43.738
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.142
You missed something.

00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:58.628
Was I thinking about how hot it was in here and where the air conditioning controller was?

00:06:58.648 --> 00:07:00.810
I made a mistake.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.001
No right paw!

00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:08.241
Right!

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.302
No hashtag!

00:07:09.382 --> 00:07:12.543
Hashtag hot!

00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:19.706
My mind is in a different place.

00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:25.588
It's hot and sweaty, hot!

00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:26.109
Ruffians!

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.329
Hi!

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.330
You didn't even notice!

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.410
Hot!

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.830
Where were we?

00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:31.931
Our aim?

00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.152
What's our aim?

00:07:34.873 --> 00:07:43.059
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw and get some air conditioning going on.

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.761
Get some air conditioning.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:54.786
Help you start off your day on the right paw and have air conditioning on your left paw.

00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:55.426
Yeah.

00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:57.021
I got it.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.183
I got it on the left paw.

00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:03.408
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.050
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.255
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:10.056
BAU BAU!

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.960
BAU BAU!

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.941
Definitely not chilly enough.

00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:20.704
Ruffians, I think it's gonna get a little cooler here.

00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:24.607
So I hope that you're all cool and comfy now.

00:08:24.627 --> 00:08:27.990
Or if you're chilly, that you're warm and toasty.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.772
And that your day starts off on the right paw.

00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:34.314
Well, this next bit of news.

00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:38.418
I'm not sure if it's gonna make you feel hot or cold.

00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:44.362
Does that make me feel...temporate?

00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:46.563
Temporate?

00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:51.825
Well... Let us know how you feel, okay?

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:55.007
Does it make you feel hot or cold, Ruffians?

00:08:55.907 --> 00:08:59.209
There's been...another Pero Sighting.

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:01.910
Let's see where he is.

00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:06.705
De-den!

00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:16.453
Peron, I need an X-Bow!

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:18.254
He wasn't invited!

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:22.297
Ruffian, did you call the call in security?

00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:23.838
Get him hauled away!

00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:25.219
That's the right answer!

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.841
So nasty!

00:09:26.861 --> 00:09:30.263
I guess he just thought he could blend into the crowd, huh?

00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:31.884
But no!

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:32.385
No.

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.826
We all know that nasty roundness, huh?

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:35.307
Yeah.

00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:36.567
Ugh, so round.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:37.288
Wow.

00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:43.531
Yeah, but we're glad to know that you didn't let him ruin our performance!

00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:44.052
Yes!

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:47.033
Thank you for BAU BAU-ing and having a lot of fun with us!

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:47.894
BAU BAU!

00:09:47.974 --> 00:09:49.675
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:52.097
Do you feel nasty now, Ruffians?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.397
Right, he was there.

00:09:53.617 --> 00:09:54.778
Do you feel a bit- Ugh!

00:09:54.838 --> 00:09:56.839
You just thought he could blend in, huh?

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.240
Yeah.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.821
Security will be fast!

00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:00.922
They'll get him!

00:10:00.982 --> 00:10:01.423
Yeah.

00:10:02.464 --> 00:10:03.865
You feel happy.

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:06.227
That's not cool, girls.

00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:08.989
I feel nasty but also hot.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.111
Nasty and hot.

00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:15.894
Hopefully the air conditioning reaches you soon.

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:17.195
Nasty and cute.

00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:18.577
I think you're confused.

00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:19.697
I think you're confused.

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:21.339
You understand what cute means?

00:10:21.499 --> 00:10:22.039
Right!

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.220
No.

00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:25.622
BAU BAU!

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.652
Well, speaking of hot right now, it's summertime and that's why it's so hot.

00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:45.596
And speaking of summertime fun, well there are some big updates to the hololive City event that's gonna be happening all across Japan this summer!

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:51.238
You know, this summer, theme parks across Japan will be paying up with hololive to put on some more

00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:52.379
Summer fun.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.819
Yeah, some summer fun.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.700
Summer, summer fun.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.781
Summer, summer fun!

00:10:57.502 --> 00:10:58.703
And FUWAMOCO!

00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:03.906
What part of the two are gonna be together with some wonderful senpai?

00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:07.308
Representing Tokyo Dome City attractions.

00:11:07.808 --> 00:11:11.351
And some new details about the collab was just released!

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.091
Wow, you saw it!

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.572
You saw it!

00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:16.094
Well, in case you didn't see it.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.795
Yeah, well, you know, first,

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.978
Lots of merch, you know, like a crim look style, and t-shirts, and clear files.

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:24.239
Lots of fun stuff!

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:32.144
But FUWAMOCO, we're actually, we're also in charge of the ride, the hoppin' droppin'!

00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:33.565
Hoppin' droppin'!

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:33.986
Bikini!

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.867
So colorful, like a ride!

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:36.748
Ride on droppin'!

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:47.013
Not just that, Ruffians, but a unique voice message from us will play, as well as hololive music during the ride, too!

00:11:47.254 --> 00:11:49.535
It looks super cute and really fun!

00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.376
A big responsibility.

00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:52.877
Please make sure you write it.

00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:55.518
Enjoy Tokyo Dome City with us!

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:57.639
I know.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.521
I saw some Ruffians saying that.

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:02.240
They'll be brave.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.442
They'll get on the ride without being embarrassed.

00:12:05.482 --> 00:12:05.882
Yeah.

00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:07.583
Why would you be embarrassed?

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:10.445
Yeah, but you know that's the spirit, right?

00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:13.107
You gotta BAU BAU that embarrassment away.

00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:14.528
Not kiddie rides!

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.289
No, no.

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:16.109
Okay, Ruffie!

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:17.310
Not baby rides!

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.713
Come here, I'm gonna BAU BAU all the way on this ride with you.

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:21.553
Ruffian's hardcore.

00:12:21.613 --> 00:12:22.474
Yeah, look.

00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:24.015
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:25.996
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.697
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:49.690
No, this is the Hoppin' Droppin'.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.790
Hoppin' Droppin'.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.911
And this is FUWAMOCO's territory.

00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:54.071
Yeah.

00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:54.411
Okay.

00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:55.792
Yeah.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:01.134
But, you know, after you go on the Hoppin' Droppin', like BAU BAU BAU, that was so much fun.

00:13:01.154 --> 00:13:03.094
Hoppin' Droppin', Hoppin' Hoppin'.

00:13:03.154 --> 00:13:08.696
You might be in the mood for some extra yummy club treats.

00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:09.637
Wow!

00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:16.759
And you know, when you think about sweets and FUWAMOCO, what comes to mind, Ruffians?

00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:25.961
Or... Or... Maybe... Some... Donuts!

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:27.801
Yeah!

00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:29.822
BAU BAU!

00:13:29.862 --> 00:13:35.543
We got some super cute BAU BAU donuts that are FUWAMOCO kind!

00:13:35.663 --> 00:13:40.224
It's a bit hard to see, but they even have, you know, a headband.

00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:48.511
Yeah, and then we also have a very fluffy and fuzzy shaved ice too!

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:52.174
There's complete sugar stars on top as well!

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:52.815
So cute!

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:55.818
I love FUWAMOCO colors!

00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.339
Right?

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.340
It looks so good, right?

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.861
I want to eat it!

00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:00.303
Please eat it!

00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:08.726
You know, maybe there'll be some Ruffians that are planning a trip to Japan too.

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.587
Maybe you'll be visiting the Tokyo area.

00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:22.252
If that's the case, you'll definitely definitely want to go and check out Tokyo Dome City attractions and go on all the rides and see everything you have to see there.

00:14:22.392 --> 00:14:23.352
Please do, okay?

00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:30.638
The kids will absolutely love these.

00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:33.221
Everyone will love them!

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:34.542
Especially FUWAMOCO.

00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:45.527
I hope you can visit!

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:49.309
You can check out the homepage for more information about the event.

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:52.911
Yeah, there's lots of fun stuff, so please check it out, okay?

00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:55.632
BAU BAU!

00:14:56.213 --> 00:15:01.395
And another super surprising and happy update, Ruffians!

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:11.141
We, FUWAMOCO, our birthday was early in the year, but the birthday merch, our first ever birthday merch, it has started shipping!

00:15:11.821 --> 00:15:14.503
BAU BAU!

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:20.227
Thank you so much for reading excitedly, Ruffians!

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.247
We're so happy!

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:27.752
You know, Ruffian plushies, the signatures, the shirts, they're starting to reach your paws!

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:33.856
You know, we were just talking about it the other day, like, I hope they get to you soon, Ruffians!

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:35.297
And now look!

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:40.100
We put so much love into each one, so we hope that if you are lucky,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.241
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:43.042
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:03.427 --> 00:16:09.151
Maybe we'll decide to put your FUWAMOCO love keychains in your bag.

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.933
Maybe... Where's Pero's merch?

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:13.467
Hi.

00:16:13.727 --> 00:16:17.690
Ruffians, you understand this is our birthday merch, not Pero's birthday merch.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.592
Pero doesn't even know when was Pero born.

00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:21.592
Nobody cares.

00:16:21.812 --> 00:16:24.534
Yeah.

00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:29.097
And Ruffians, you know, our first birthday merch has finally arrived.

00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:34.380
Maybe, you know, maybe that FUWAMOCO shine, maybe a bloom?

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.161
A blossom?

00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.442
A blossom has bloomed.

00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:37.122
What?

00:16:39.084 --> 00:16:41.288
It's not spring anymore!

00:16:41.308 --> 00:16:44.894
It's spring for the FUWAMOCO shrine maiden!

00:16:47.877 --> 00:16:58.200
So you know, if you've been working on one, maybe it might start rapidly expanding soon!

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.641
Please let us know how the FUWAMOCO Shine is going, Ruffians!

00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:05.241
How much you enjoy everything!

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:09.642
It doesn't all ship out, so you might get your notice soon, okay?

00:17:09.702 --> 00:17:11.103
Soon, yeah.

00:17:11.143 --> 00:17:12.583
You might not have gotten it yet.

00:17:13.343 --> 00:17:16.966
But very soon, FUWAMOCO friends are getting them now.

00:17:17.386 --> 00:17:19.108
So, soon.

00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:21.490
BAU BAU!

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.892
We're excited!

00:17:24.592 --> 00:17:31.818
And well, also you know, a big part of the summer of Advent.

00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:35.201
Recently, we shared the news with you that

00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:37.323
FUWAMOCO, the pervert!

00:17:37.343 --> 00:17:38.744
FUWAMOCO, the advent!

00:17:38.784 --> 00:17:42.807
We'll be partnering together with FUWAMOCO to release some apparel!

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:46.310
And it just went on sale recently, Ruffians!

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.514
We're able to get your paws on some!

00:17:50.854 --> 00:17:54.597
We saw some Ruffians already out on the beltway, then reached you!

00:17:54.817 --> 00:17:55.898
Yeah, thank you!

00:17:55.978 --> 00:17:56.699
You got yours!

00:17:56.739 --> 00:17:57.640
Got the stuff!

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.741
Yeah, you got your clothes!

00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:03.804
We've been so happy and proud seeing you wear them!

00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:05.846
Seeing you proudly wear them!

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.488
Not just wear them, you know.

00:18:08.948 --> 00:18:10.369
Here's a shirt on my body.

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:13.031
No, it's a... This is FUWAMOCO's shirt!

00:18:13.152 --> 00:18:15.233
You're making them all so fashionable!

00:18:15.253 --> 00:18:16.174
Nice coordinates.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.781
It makes me so happy!

00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.602
Yeah, you look so cool in a Ruffian!

00:18:23.362 --> 00:18:31.485
But, you know, speaking of her... There are actually some hololive English skate decks that went on scale... scale?

00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:32.266
Scale!

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:33.926
On sale!

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:35.626
The skate decks went on sale!

00:18:36.227 --> 00:18:36.407
And!

00:18:36.807 --> 00:18:38.227
Ah, ah, FUWAMOCO.

00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:42.388
We also had a skate deck too!

00:18:42.428 --> 00:18:42.928
Yeah!

00:18:43.028 --> 00:18:43.448
I know.

00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:46.108
And I guess we are a bit surprised.

00:18:46.128 --> 00:18:46.448
Yeah.

00:18:46.729 --> 00:18:51.869
Because it seems like a lot of Ruffians really like to skate around in their hobby.

00:18:51.889 --> 00:18:54.470
Because they all sold out super fast!

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.450
Ruffians!

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.730
We are so surprised!

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.531
You all skateboard!

00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:03.354
I thought Ruffians, you know, like to BAU BAU.

00:19:03.415 --> 00:19:07.439
I guess they like to do flips too.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:10.362
We're able to get one Ruffians!

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:14.346
Are you still glad that we don't escape?

00:19:16.168 --> 00:19:17.649
You could, you could.

00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:19.051
Come FUWAMOCO Mine!

00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:19.651
No.

00:19:20.612 --> 00:19:21.232
No.

00:19:21.252 --> 00:19:23.793
We can't ride a bike.

00:19:24.434 --> 00:19:25.094
You got it!

00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:27.215
You got it!

00:19:27.255 --> 00:19:28.275
You can do flips!

00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:36.119
Well that means Ruffians, you gotta do some flips at the same time then!

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:42.341
Or, you know, maybe if you don't skate yet, you could decorate your room with it too!

00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:46.383
Well, we hope that maybe this will inspire you to not

00:19:47.043 --> 00:19:49.527
Learn some cool tricks.

00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:59.179
Maybe you can take some photos and use the hashtag FWMCMORNING to let us know you've been skating too!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:04.066
Imagine a video of a Ruffian being like BAU BAU BAU!

00:20:05.768 --> 00:20:12.754
We know a lot of Ruffians are also a little bit sad that they weren't able to get their paws on them before they sold out.

00:20:13.054 --> 00:20:17.758
But we hope that there's a restock sometime soon in the future, Ruffians.

00:20:18.198 --> 00:20:21.020
So don't give hope up yet, okay?

00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:22.362
Don't give up hope yet.

00:20:22.662 --> 00:20:24.724
BAU BAU!

00:20:29.898 --> 00:20:31.799
Sighting Ruffians!

00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.600
I wanna see your flips, okay?

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.640
Let's see your flips!

00:20:35.421 --> 00:20:36.881
But also don't get hurt, okay?

00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:37.602
No getting hurt.

00:20:37.622 --> 00:20:40.003
We'll protect your smile, but we can't protect your bones.

00:20:41.303 --> 00:20:44.445
BAU BAU!

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:45.385
Helmet days!

00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:46.286
Helmet days!

00:20:46.566 --> 00:20:47.566
Absolutely.

00:20:47.586 --> 00:20:48.266
Knee pads.

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:49.647
Elbow pads.

00:20:51.248 --> 00:20:51.768
And you know what?

00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:54.569
Maybe you can find a helmet that has ears.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:55.670
Is that safe?

00:20:56.843 --> 00:20:58.445
Safety first, safety first.

00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:01.387
BAU BAU!

00:21:01.968 --> 00:21:03.469
On the topic of safety.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.650
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:05.031 --> 00:21:08.014
We went to the doctor!

00:21:08.054 --> 00:21:11.957
The day we visited the doctor.

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:17.703
And you know, it's been really busy and we've been running around like crazy.

00:21:18.063 --> 00:21:19.845
On top of things, you know,

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:24.727
Our barkers, they've been barking like they've never barked before over the last few months.

00:21:25.107 --> 00:21:30.889
So, you know, today was an important day to go visit the doctor and see how they are doing.

00:21:31.209 --> 00:21:39.693
We're a little worried, but the doctor said that our barkers look beautiful and sent us quickly on our way with new photos to give to Shiori.

00:21:39.753 --> 00:21:47.476
Yeah, Moco-chan was like, um, there's somebody who wants a photo, so can you make sure you give me a photo?

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:48.016
Doctor,

00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:48.997
Yeah.

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:51.639
Will I get another photo as a souvenir today?

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:55.862
Because I have a friend that's pretty cool.

00:21:55.963 --> 00:21:56.843
Yeah.

00:21:57.564 --> 00:22:00.606
I think this time, I'm pretty sure last time it wasn't in color.

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:01.467
I think it was.

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:04.590
I don't know, I think the doctor might have printed in color just for her.

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:11.095
I don't know now, it's a little bit... Wow.

00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:15.359
But, you know, we were really happy that everything was all good!

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:15.839
Yes!

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.672
You know, the only advice we got was to drink even more water.

00:22:22.692 --> 00:22:24.553
For our barkers.

00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:28.354
Even though we already drink a lot of water.

00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:29.055
Yeah.

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:29.875
Every day.

00:22:29.895 --> 00:22:30.695
Yeah.

00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:31.836
More than two liters.

00:22:33.903 --> 00:22:37.065
So make sure you drink water till okay, Ruffians!

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:39.547
We'll do whatever is best for our health.

00:22:39.587 --> 00:22:40.388
BAU BAU!

00:22:40.468 --> 00:22:44.751
Is it important to drink water?

00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:46.052
Okay.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:47.253
Not coffee.

00:22:47.273 --> 00:22:48.154
Not coffee.

00:22:48.214 --> 00:22:50.256
Not soda.

00:22:50.296 --> 00:22:51.317
Not soda.

00:22:51.337 --> 00:22:52.017
No.

00:22:52.418 --> 00:22:52.618
No.

00:22:53.218 --> 00:22:53.739
Water.

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:56.741
Water.

00:22:57.181 --> 00:22:57.642
Okay.

00:22:58.662 --> 00:22:59.203
Good for you.

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:01.146
Water!

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:02.026
Not coffee!

00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:03.087
Not watermelon!

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:03.388
No.

00:23:03.788 --> 00:23:07.031
No watermelon is good, but not watermelon!

00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:07.891
Water.

00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:08.172
H2O.

00:23:08.812 --> 00:23:09.533
Okay.

00:23:10.313 --> 00:23:11.254
How about tea?

00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:13.176
The doctor said not tea!

00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:14.477
He said water.

00:23:14.617 --> 00:23:16.279
Only one cup of tea, okay?

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:16.559
Yeah.

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:17.600
Yeah.

00:23:18.745 --> 00:23:21.787
BAU BAU!

00:23:21.807 --> 00:23:25.289
Oops, you're drinking coffee right now.

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:26.449
That's okay.

00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:28.350
You can have a little coffee right now.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.631
You know, it is the morning.

00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:31.952
But make sure after that it's always water, okay?

00:23:31.992 --> 00:23:32.613
BAU BAU!

00:23:32.633 --> 00:23:37.055
Listen to the doctor, okay?

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:45.440
Actually, there's something that's been a little bit on my mind for the past few days.

00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:53.819
Maybe some Ruffians already heard, but something really happy happened to us!

00:23:54.359 --> 00:24:01.140
You know, the other day, we were in our most intense and long dance practice yet.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.701
And FUWAMOCO, we were doing our absolute best.

00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:07.422
We were very sweaty puppies.

00:24:07.542 --> 00:24:09.442
And we were just working like dogs.

00:24:09.942 --> 00:24:12.322
And we were absolutely exhausted.

00:24:12.402 --> 00:24:13.683
A bit frustrated.

00:24:13.723 --> 00:24:14.023
Yeah.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:22.391
While we were just taking a moment to gather our breath, suddenly I got a big hug from behind!

00:24:22.852 --> 00:24:24.572
At first, you know, I was like, oh, no way!

00:24:24.612 --> 00:24:31.793
But it turned out it was Marine-senchou-senpai!

00:24:31.913 --> 00:24:34.134
She came to give us a big hug!

00:24:34.274 --> 00:24:35.774
A big hug.

00:24:35.814 --> 00:24:36.334
A big hug.

00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:40.957
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:42.158
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:43.579
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:45.561
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.659
I'll never, ever, ever forget it.

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:09.582
I was so, so, so, so surprised and so happy.

00:25:09.942 --> 00:25:11.363
It just makes me so happy.

00:25:11.423 --> 00:25:14.004
Incredibly happy when I think about it.

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.986
I know we are both- No tummy touching!

00:25:17.106 --> 00:25:18.066
No, just a hug.

00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:20.127
Just a soft and warm hug.

00:25:20.147 --> 00:25:23.029
We are both really, really tired.

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:26.331
We're worried about if we're doing well.

00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:31.414
So, it really meant so much to us at that moment.

00:25:31.654 --> 00:25:39.499
Thank you for the wonderfully warm and soft hugs, my FUWAMOCO!

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:42.801
I don't think we'll ever ever forget them, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.022
I can still feel it.

00:25:44.683 --> 00:25:47.027
Did you feel the moment?

00:25:47.187 --> 00:25:48.809
Did you feel the moment?

00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:51.173
Did you capture the moment?

00:25:51.213 --> 00:25:52.334
I captured the moment!

00:25:52.415 --> 00:25:56.421
I can feel Marine-senchou-senpai on my back!

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:00.889
She captured the moment!

00:26:01.569 --> 00:26:03.150
I captured it!

00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:04.151
BAU BAU!

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.093
But it was sad news.

00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:12.297
It seems like Senchou-senpai is pretty sick right now.

00:26:12.317 --> 00:26:15.360
So let's all wish her a speedy recovery, okay?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.361
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:20.424
Get better soon!

00:26:21.084 --> 00:26:24.565
BAU BAU!

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:25.365
Ruffians!

00:26:25.745 --> 00:26:28.646
Make sure that you stay healthy too, okay?

00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:30.347
Wash those paws!

00:26:30.707 --> 00:26:31.687
Get lots of sleep.

00:26:31.987 --> 00:26:37.509
Make sure you get vitamins too, okay?

00:26:37.949 --> 00:26:47.912
But maybe, you know, Ruffians, maybe there's a vitamin that you can't get from, you know, some good spinach.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.451
Natto.

00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:55.618
Maybe a vitamin that only Moco-chan... A vitamin Moco-chan can give.

00:26:55.638 --> 00:26:57.400
What type of vitamin is that?

00:26:58.061 --> 00:27:00.864
I think it's a... Mococo Pup Talk?

00:27:01.024 --> 00:27:01.705
No.

00:27:02.786 --> 00:27:03.647
Is that a vitamin?

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:06.610
Ruffians, is that a vitamin?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.692
Vitamin MCC.

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.236
FWMC.

00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:12.296
Hi!

00:27:13.317 --> 00:27:13.897
Yeah!

00:27:13.917 --> 00:27:13.957
Hi!

00:27:14.538 --> 00:27:16.759
BAU Moco-chan!

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.339
Hi!

00:27:17.399 --> 00:27:18.620
We want the vitamin!

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.041
Give us the vitamin!

00:27:25.344 --> 00:27:26.545
Ruffians!

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.447
It's that day of the week again!

00:27:30.467 --> 00:27:34.970
It's time for a famous Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:35.610
Famous?

00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:37.291
Famous.

00:27:39.318 --> 00:27:40.359
Are you gonna hear it?

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:43.020
Sing for me, Mococo!

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.143
I... I have been sleeping, Ruffians.

00:27:49.163 --> 00:27:51.664
A bit tired.

00:27:51.744 --> 00:27:56.706
I... My eyes feeling so heavy.

00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:58.647
That they could be rocks.

00:28:01.361 --> 00:28:02.301
It's okay!

00:28:03.302 --> 00:28:04.382
It's okay, Ruffians!

00:28:04.422 --> 00:28:05.843
You can take a bit of a break.

00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:13.125
It's important to have a bit of rest and some fun time every now and then to re-energize yourself, you know?

00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:20.828
Even if it's something just like going to get your favorite yummy treat or hanging out with a friend or a family member for a bit.

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:24.669
You know, it can really make a change in your energy levels, right?

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:36.239
If you're feeling super sleepy and you just can't shake that feeling, it's okay to take a nice rest, okay?

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.925
You're always doing your best, but you need to sleep so then you can continue to go go go too, okay?

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.092
And good night to those who want to sleep.

00:28:49.753 --> 00:28:52.735
And good morning to those who are ready to go, okay?

00:28:53.235 --> 00:28:53.976
You can do it!

00:28:53.996 --> 00:28:55.417
Ganbatte de!

00:28:55.437 --> 00:28:56.158
BAU BAU!

00:28:56.238 --> 00:28:57.379
BAU BAU!

00:29:03.906 --> 00:29:05.547
Do your best, Ruffians!

00:29:05.747 --> 00:29:07.988
BAU BAU!

00:29:08.408 --> 00:29:13.311
Well, maybe let's take a look at today's Doggie of the Day, shall we?

00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:17.613
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Luna!

00:29:17.713 --> 00:29:19.634
Luna!

00:29:19.694 --> 00:29:21.515
BAU BAU!

00:29:21.555 --> 00:29:23.676
Look at the silly pinkie pie!

00:29:25.297 --> 00:29:26.518
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:42.323
She loves giving kisses.

00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:43.243
That's what I mean.

00:29:43.263 --> 00:29:46.085
She's just a little puppy still.

00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:47.206
Right.

00:29:48.227 --> 00:29:49.367
Just a cute nibble.

00:29:49.928 --> 00:29:50.688
Yeah.

00:29:50.728 --> 00:29:51.329
That's right!

00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:52.890
A cute nibble.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:54.431
Yeah.

00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:57.213
But yeah, she loves giving kisses.

00:29:57.573 --> 00:29:59.194
I'm sure getting kisses too.

00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:03.457
But also very much loves belly rubs.

00:30:03.637 --> 00:30:05.718
She loves to go on walks too.

00:30:05.898 --> 00:30:06.959
Yeah!

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:07.699
Yeah.

00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:12.863
I just wanna give her a big head pat!

00:30:12.903 --> 00:30:15.045
But I wanna touch the cheeks.

00:30:15.345 --> 00:30:16.005
The cheeks?

00:30:16.306 --> 00:30:17.426
Yeah.

00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:19.948
How do you think Luna BAU BAUs?

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:20.609
BAU BAU!

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:22.370
BAU BAU!

00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:24.091
BAU BAU!

00:30:25.472 --> 00:30:26.093
Like that.

00:30:28.054 --> 00:30:30.556
So it sounds a little bit like a Pokemon.

00:30:31.116 --> 00:30:31.317
No.

00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:34.973
No, that's how Luna BAU BAU is.

00:30:35.013 --> 00:30:38.075
Luna's the Doggie of the Day!

00:30:38.155 --> 00:30:39.876
Luna is Luna!

00:30:39.896 --> 00:30:43.919
Well, you know, Luna is a sweetheart to everyone.

00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:48.061
And she's always super friendly, wanting to get to know everybody.

00:30:48.082 --> 00:30:56.927
But, but, but... If you're Raccoon, she hasn't forgotten about the time that you stole her food.

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:58.408
She doesn't forget easily.

00:30:58.448 --> 00:31:02.671
Yeah, so... You might get BAU BAU'd away a little bit.

00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:11.530
But I'm sure you know, as long as you bring back some food, maybe things will be better.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.291
BAU BAU!

00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:17.051
Ruffians!

00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:20.352
Let's see what kind of solo adventures you've been having lately.

00:31:20.432 --> 00:31:22.793
Where have you been going for a walk recently?

00:31:23.393 --> 00:31:26.654
Today's walk is... De-den!

00:31:27.334 --> 00:31:28.975
It's us!

00:31:29.576 --> 00:31:32.337
Such a beautiful view!

00:31:32.397 --> 00:31:34.919
Did we go up the mountain together with you?

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:37.500
We're there together with you!

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.121
FUWAMOCO wanna hike and look!

00:31:39.141 --> 00:31:42.603
We're ready for some adventures in our expo outfit there.

00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:44.164
Look at our shirt!

00:31:44.304 --> 00:31:46.965
Proper hiking outfit.

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:53.569
Thank you for, you know, taking us along with you and bringing the pon-de-ring offsprings for us!

00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:55.970
Biboo.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.011
That's not a boy!

00:32:01.492 --> 00:32:03.652
But we love going on adventures!

00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.453
Thank you!

00:32:05.533 --> 00:32:06.773
Thank you!

00:32:06.894 --> 00:32:08.194
Which do FUWAMOCO prefer?

00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:10.615
Team Beach or Team Mountain?

00:32:12.295 --> 00:32:13.096
It's Mountain!

00:32:13.176 --> 00:32:13.536
Mountain.

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:15.677
Beach.

00:32:16.477 --> 00:32:19.118
I'm feeling so hot.

00:32:20.989 --> 00:32:21.429
Mountain.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.312
If you want a bathing suit up the mountain.

00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:26.173
No.

00:32:27.054 --> 00:32:29.476
BAU BAU!

00:32:29.836 --> 00:32:32.738
BAU BAU!

00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:36.281
Today we have our Question of the Day!

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:39.143
What kind of question did we receive this time?

00:32:39.264 --> 00:32:40.164
De-den!

00:32:40.585 --> 00:32:41.725
Good day FUWAMOCO!

00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:42.966
Good day!

00:32:43.347 --> 00:32:46.109
Q. How do you communicate to cats?

00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:47.230
Do you go up

00:32:52.752 --> 00:32:53.112
Cat, cat!

00:32:53.152 --> 00:32:54.453
Come here, come here!

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:24.839
Just like that, Ruffians.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.380
You don't do that!

00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.682
You don't do that!

00:33:29.762 --> 00:33:30.583
It works well.

00:33:31.023 --> 00:33:35.385
It's not kissy, it's... That's how you call the cat to you.

00:33:35.645 --> 00:33:37.767
You do the same, yeah.

00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:39.067
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:39.327 --> 00:33:40.108
Yeah.

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:45.911
No, Ruffians!

00:33:47.132 --> 00:33:48.032
Just like that.

00:33:48.052 --> 00:33:49.353
Just like that, and it works.

00:33:49.473 --> 00:33:50.113
It works!

00:33:50.714 --> 00:33:51.214
It works.

00:33:52.523 --> 00:33:54.104
Do you believe us, Moffins?

00:33:55.145 --> 00:33:57.527
If you were a cat, what would it be?

00:33:57.547 --> 00:34:01.971
Teach us again!

00:34:02.411 --> 00:34:03.052
What?

00:34:03.392 --> 00:34:04.693
I can't remember.

00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:06.555
I need a cat here.

00:34:07.055 --> 00:34:07.535
Yeah.

00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:08.836
It works.

00:34:09.117 --> 00:34:09.617
It works.

00:34:09.697 --> 00:34:10.097
It works.

00:34:10.178 --> 00:34:10.618
It works.

00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:11.759
Oh yeah.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.480
Only sometimes it doesn't work.

00:34:14.081 --> 00:34:15.962
But maybe that's because they didn't hear us, huh?

00:34:15.982 --> 00:34:17.424
Or maybe because we're chasing them.

00:34:17.544 --> 00:34:19.765
Maybe.

00:34:19.845 --> 00:34:21.647
That's how we communicate to cats.

00:34:22.834 --> 00:34:23.495
Kisses.

00:34:25.137 --> 00:34:25.678
Sniffs.

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:31.267
BAU BAU!

00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.471
Eating isn't part of the communication right?

00:34:35.095 --> 00:34:57.834
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make together, so it means so much to us that you're here bright and early here with us, and that you also share, you know, your Doggie of the Day, your Mocs, questions, and your Pero Sightings.

00:34:59.155 --> 00:35:08.984
And don't forget we also have the hashtag FWMC scoop for any interesting new hololive scoops that might have popped up that you're like, oh!

00:35:09.044 --> 00:35:10.846
FUWAMOCO need to hear about this!

00:35:11.246 --> 00:35:14.169
Thank you so much Ruffians!

00:35:14.249 --> 00:35:14.809
BAU BAU!

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.052
And for our next stream we have...

00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:19.814
De-den!

00:35:20.394 --> 00:35:22.055
Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:25.517
We're continuing our adventure.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:27.398
Right now we're on such a cool level.

00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:31.561
It's very different from anything in Donkey Kong Country so far.

00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:35.003
But I can't help but think... Miyuki.

00:35:36.764 --> 00:35:39.226
Don't you know about Miyuki from Donkey Kong Country 2?

00:35:39.266 --> 00:35:41.947
There's a heroine that's suffering.

00:35:42.968 --> 00:35:44.949
She's in the hospital.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.431
Maybe she doesn't have much longer.

00:35:48.172 --> 00:35:50.633
We have to see how Miyuki does.

00:35:51.073 --> 00:35:55.735
As we get to the level and gather all the bananas and continue on our adventure in Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:58.856
BAU BAU!

00:35:58.876 --> 00:36:02.437
Let's take a peek at our schedule.

00:36:02.457 --> 00:36:05.778
Our schedule here at the Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:36:06.018 --> 00:36:09.119
It's a little bit early at 4 am PT.

00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:11.920
Moco-chan and I are going to be chained together.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.881
Chained together!

00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:17.386
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:30.034
Well, we're gonna do our best!

00:36:30.134 --> 00:36:31.914
Please join us, Ruffians!

00:36:31.934 --> 00:36:37.956
But maybe if you know it's a little bit early, maybe if you're like, oh, that's when I get my, like, you know, my, my sleep.

00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:40.037
Then, get your sleep.

00:36:40.257 --> 00:36:42.098
Sleep is important, okay?

00:36:42.238 --> 00:36:49.000
And the archive will be there later, and then, you know, later, you know, if you're like, I wanna see FUWAMOCO live, too!

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.981
Well, we're gonna be having an epic live!

00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:56.082
Chatting all about Japan over on Nerissa's channel!

00:36:56.102 --> 00:36:57.603
But it's just us and Nerissa.

00:36:58.163 --> 00:37:00.004
There's been a little bit of changes.

00:37:00.124 --> 00:37:02.225
It's just gonna be us and Nerissa.

00:37:03.086 --> 00:37:06.087
When we ask Nerissa, Nerissa, maybe we should change things.

00:37:06.488 --> 00:37:08.329
You know we could do something else.

00:37:08.609 --> 00:37:09.509
Nerissa's like, no.

00:37:10.009 --> 00:37:13.351
I just wanna chat about how much I love you, FUWAMOCO.

00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:14.072
Right?

00:37:14.212 --> 00:37:15.332
Is that how much she said?
