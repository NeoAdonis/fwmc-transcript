Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:01.617 --> 05:05.582
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:05.743 --> 05:09.508
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:09.548 --> 05:11.370
BAU BAU!

05:11.991 --> 05:14.975
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:15.416 --> 05:17.118
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:18.099 --> 05:20.062
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:20.122 --> 05:21.103
BAU BAU!

05:21.163 --> 05:23.767
You're really tall today, huh?

05:23.787 --> 05:25.008
I'm tall.

05:25.930 --> 05:30.576
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:30.636 --> 05:31.818
Even if I was tall today.

05:31.838 --> 05:34.561
Did you stretch a bit too hard?

05:35.302 --> 05:36.823
Yeah, I did stretch quite a bit.

05:36.903 --> 05:41.427
I was feeling a little sore after yesterday, but... But Ruffians!

05:41.948 --> 05:46.992
Thank you for joining us today for our 54th episode!

05:47.212 --> 05:49.254
BAU BAU!

05:49.814 --> 06:00.984
Well, for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show, and it's held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:01.304 --> 06:01.824
A.K.A.

06:01.905 --> 06:02.665
FUWAMOCO!

06:03.646 --> 06:06.146
It's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:06.487 --> 06:12.848
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:12.908 --> 06:14.808
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:15.188 --> 06:17.989
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

06:18.809 --> 06:23.310
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:23.690 --> 06:26.690
BAU BAU!

06:26.850 --> 06:27.890
Ruffians.

06:28.911 --> 06:30.271
Ruffians first.

06:34.492 --> 06:38.055
I wanted to say that was uncalled for, Moco-chan.

06:38.075 --> 06:39.516
Great sneezy morning!

06:39.536 --> 06:44.899
I was gonna apologize, but now I have to apologize for Moco-chan too.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.821
Ruffians, I'm sorry.

06:47.601 --> 06:50.163
I'm sorry for the sister of mine.

06:50.363 --> 06:59.930
And I'm also sorry because it seems like Pero kinda took over FUWAMOCO Morning the other day.

07:01.539 --> 07:03.479
Are you doing okay, ruffians?

07:04.800 --> 07:08.700
You know, especially because Moco-chan wasn't there at the pup talk for you.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.421
Is that my fault now?

07:10.521 --> 07:16.702
It's not your fault, but... We hope Pero wasn't too nasty.

07:17.202 --> 07:19.783
You're traumatized.

07:20.283 --> 07:22.883
Oh my gosh.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.844
Pero's break was ruined.

07:25.704 --> 07:30.965
Wait, your body's now... I don't know about that.

07:32.503 --> 07:36.326
Well, it seems like he was there to try to teach us a lesson.

07:36.346 --> 07:39.548
That FUWAMOCO Morning is too long, right?

07:39.569 --> 07:44.472
You know, it is a short-format morning show after all.

07:44.773 --> 07:46.874
Like I say every morning, right?

07:47.355 --> 07:49.656
So, we're gonna have to shorten it down.

07:49.857 --> 07:54.080
Otherwise, Pero will be back waaaay sooner than...

07:54.758 --> 07:55.018
BAU BAU!

07:55.038 --> 07:55.318
BAU BAU!

07:55.338 --> 07:55.518
BAU BAU!

08:24.252 --> 08:24.933
You're confused.

08:25.053 --> 08:25.533
It's okay.

08:25.593 --> 08:26.154
It's the morning.

08:26.174 --> 08:27.215
You're still sleepy.

08:27.455 --> 08:29.197
You don't know what's going on.

08:29.537 --> 08:30.017
It's okay.

08:30.097 --> 08:30.358
It's okay!

08:30.878 --> 08:35.803
Hopefully we don't see Peron for a very long, long time now.

08:35.823 --> 08:35.903
Yeah.

08:37.764 --> 08:38.005
Why?

08:39.626 --> 08:39.866
What?

08:40.287 --> 08:40.487
What?

08:41.408 --> 08:41.648
What?

08:42.429 --> 08:45.632
There was a... Okay, what's sighting?

08:48.837 --> 08:50.338
What did I just see, though?

08:51.338 --> 08:54.879
Well, let's see where this ruffian spotted Pero.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.741
De-den!

09:00.502 --> 09:00.782
Oh!

09:02.082 --> 09:03.903
There's Pero, that's him.

09:03.923 --> 09:06.244
Oh gosh.

09:07.404 --> 09:11.466
Ruffians, do we really need to give him any more attention than he deserves?

09:12.560 --> 09:15.284
Trying to sniff your tires.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.788
Is this some sort of hobby of Pero's?

09:19.289 --> 09:20.531
Sounds kinda like it.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.349
That's kind of a dangerous hobby you got there.

09:24.830 --> 09:28.953
You know, being low to the ground, behind a car tire there.

09:29.854 --> 09:33.597
Ruffians, definitely don't try this kind of thing, okay?

09:33.737 --> 09:33.977
Yeah.

09:34.558 --> 09:36.359
Pero is asking for trouble.

09:36.579 --> 09:37.740
Yeah.

09:38.201 --> 09:45.326
Well, hopefully everything worked out for this ruffian and you were able to use your car with no troubles afterwards.

09:46.647 --> 09:46.888
Right?

09:47.148 --> 09:47.368
Yeah.

09:47.989 --> 09:48.609
No trouble.

09:50.878 --> 09:54.381
BAU BAU!

09:55.062 --> 09:55.983
Forget about that.

09:56.003 --> 09:57.043
Forget about it.

09:57.104 --> 09:58.985
I just wanna forget about it.

09:59.025 --> 10:00.346
Forget about it.

10:00.747 --> 10:01.507
But next!

10:02.028 --> 10:02.768
Ruffians!

10:03.449 --> 10:05.050
RUFFIANS!

10:05.170 --> 10:07.732
We're so happy because...

10:08.783 --> 10:10.044
Lifetime Showtime!

10:10.064 --> 10:11.424
FUWAMOCO!

10:11.484 --> 10:13.165
I am with you in your song!

10:13.945 --> 10:16.026
Got 300,000 views!

10:16.066 --> 10:19.207
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.507
Thank you!

10:22.780 --> 10:23.160
We did it!

10:23.521 --> 10:26.363
We shared lifetime showtime back with you!

10:26.803 --> 10:29.465
During our debut, you were remembered by Ruffians!

10:30.005 --> 10:31.787
And it's hit 300,000 views now!

10:32.507 --> 10:34.949
Thank you so much for loving it!

10:35.069 --> 10:37.050
And listening to it so much, Ruffians!

10:37.791 --> 10:38.211
Thank you!

10:38.311 --> 10:40.233
It really means so much to us.

10:41.033 --> 10:48.560
Especially, you know, since before we talked about it, our big goal was maybe that it could hit 300,000 views one day, right?

10:49.361 --> 10:50.802
And you know it!

10:51.283 --> 10:53.084
We did it!

10:53.325 --> 10:54.045
We did it!

10:54.125 --> 10:57.228
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

10:57.248 --> 11:00.031
Wow, this song, my first showtime, it was written by another

11:00.231 --> 11:01.012
I got it.

11:29.092 --> 11:31.113
You are so many subscribers!

11:31.173 --> 11:33.875
Has hit 3 million views!

11:33.915 --> 11:36.856
BAU BAU!

11:36.917 --> 11:38.718
Thank you!

11:39.178 --> 11:42.600
My first cover song.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.641
Ruffians, you were pretty surprised, right?

11:44.681 --> 11:45.301
When we said it.

11:45.601 --> 11:48.003
With you at the end of our debut, right?

11:48.043 --> 11:50.924
Right, because you listened to Lifetime so many times.

11:50.964 --> 11:51.825
BAU BAU!

11:51.905 --> 11:52.485
BAU BAU!

11:52.525 --> 11:53.125
BAU BAU!

11:53.206 --> 11:53.566
Right.

11:54.806 --> 11:55.327
Right!

11:55.547 --> 11:57.028
Right, you know.

11:57.768 --> 12:06.280
We weren't able to see your reaction then, because you know we were busy running off to meet up with all the Advent members, you know, for a collab.

12:07.723 --> 12:10.466
I'm still curious.

12:10.627 --> 12:11.889
What were you feeling back then?

12:13.090 --> 12:17.856
But thank you so much, ruffians, for still listening to a bunch.

12:18.136 --> 12:20.159
It really means a lot to us.

12:21.060 --> 12:27.768
And we hope that we can put a lot more effort and strength and power into putting more music

12:28.348 --> 12:30.209
Thank you, ruffians!

12:30.809 --> 12:32.930
Thank you!

12:33.310 --> 12:35.511
Moco-chan, what kind of song would you like to sing next?

12:35.652 --> 12:36.212
I don't know.

12:36.832 --> 12:38.713
There's a lot of songs that I would like to sing.

12:38.813 --> 12:38.973
Right?

12:38.993 --> 12:41.354
Kaibutsu was kind of cool and powerful.

12:41.434 --> 12:44.176
I sort of have fun sort of surprising the ruffians.

12:44.196 --> 12:52.179
So I feel like I would like to do, maybe, maybe not very soon, but sometime I would like to do something that surprises you.

12:52.199 --> 12:53.540
Surprises the ruffians.

12:54.011 --> 12:56.312
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

12:56.352 --> 12:56.592
BAU BAU!

12:56.932 --> 12:59.753
I don't really get it, but it's very happy!

13:16.613 --> 13:20.055
The hololive reddit has hit over 1,000,000!

13:20.195 --> 13:20.915
BAU BAU!

13:22.696 --> 13:26.038
Can you believe it?

13:26.058 --> 13:27.818
That's a lot of people, Ruffians.

13:27.838 --> 13:29.779
A lot of people.

13:29.799 --> 13:29.779
1,000,000.

13:30.179 --> 13:33.521
1,000,000.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.521
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for loving hololive.

13:33.841 --> 13:40.004
No matter where you are on the internet, be it YouTube or Twitter or TikTok and Reddit.

13:40.084 --> 13:41.165
Thank you!

13:41.205 --> 13:41.745
Nice.

13:44.887 --> 13:52.470
We hope, ruffians, that you'll continue to share your passion about hololive with everyone out there.

13:52.490 --> 14:01.475
You know, we actually joined the hololive reddit recently, and we started posting every now and then, so if you see us there, don't be surprised.

14:01.495 --> 14:06.297
You know, every now and then I see in the comments being like, is this the actual FUWAMOCO?

14:08.318 --> 14:12.040
Yeah, I know it says BAU BAU.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.701
It does.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.703
But you know, we don't really know how Reddit works still, so...

14:19.233 --> 14:19.493
BAU BAU!

14:49.213 --> 14:50.514
Thank you!

14:50.594 --> 14:51.714
Thank you, Ruffians!

14:51.774 --> 14:54.316
Thank you, hololive fans!

14:55.136 --> 14:58.818
Well, actually... On Monday.

14:58.838 --> 15:00.659
Monday.

15:00.679 --> 15:01.860
Monday was it.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.242
Well, we asked for something from you, Ruffians.

15:06.502 --> 15:12.565
And finally, we got our first big FUWAMOCO scoop!

15:13.306 --> 15:15.447
Given to us by a Ruffian.

15:16.407 --> 15:17.148
We have...

15:18.979 --> 15:22.000
Cooney passed her driver's license exam!

15:22.040 --> 15:22.660
BAU BAU!

15:22.720 --> 15:23.901
Yeah!

15:23.921 --> 15:27.602
The crunchy tail fight just passed her driver's license exam.

15:27.702 --> 15:28.622
That's pretty cool.

15:28.722 --> 15:29.503
Amazing.

15:29.543 --> 15:33.024
Congratulations Cooney!

15:33.064 --> 15:33.984
Congratulations!

15:34.064 --> 15:34.864
I'm not envious.

15:35.164 --> 15:40.126
You know, we've heard that those kind of things are pretty rough sometimes.

15:40.966 --> 15:42.227
Ice-steaming great dogs!

15:43.047 --> 15:45.067
We like to keep our paws on the ground, yeah.

15:45.087 --> 15:45.728
On the ground, yeah.

15:45.748 --> 15:46.628

On the ground, yeah.

16:10.933 --> 16:11.533
On the

16:13.158 --> 16:18.405
I'm getting nervous!

16:30.819 --> 16:31.219
BAU BAU!

16:31.239 --> 16:31.560
BAU BAU!

16:31.600 --> 16:32.120
BAU BAU!

17:01.726 --> 17:03.828
Ruffians.

17:06.590 --> 17:10.113
There's been, I guess, a misunderstanding.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.776
A bit of a misunderstanding.

17:13.496 --> 17:13.977
Yeah.

17:14.477 --> 17:19.401
Kind of a big misunderstanding.

17:19.542 --> 17:24.826
Well, this time, you know, Fuwawa, she misunderstood something.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.589
That's why it's a big misunderstanding, okay?

17:29.363 --> 17:30.364
Guys, you see.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.328
During our holo parade stream.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.050
You know there was a minigame.

17:35.510 --> 17:38.254
And up at the top right, it had the game controls written out.

17:38.334 --> 17:39.695
You know, like this.

17:41.998 --> 17:44.060
What do you think it's saying?

17:45.722 --> 17:45.883
Well.

17:46.923 --> 17:47.844
Fuwawa!

17:48.504 --> 17:51.886
She understood it as W equals jump.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.067
S equals space.

17:56.148 --> 18:01.111
And thought that those were the buttons to control the character the entire time.

18:01.632 --> 18:02.372
She thought that.

18:02.992 --> 18:04.473
Until yesterday evening.

18:06.969 --> 18:14.714
Ruffians, I only realized that it really doesn't make sense yesterday, but... You know W jump?

18:14.814 --> 18:16.195
Okay, okay, okay.

18:16.915 --> 18:18.096
The S space.

18:18.516 --> 18:19.777
She wasn't thinking about it.

18:21.195 --> 18:24.378
Now that I think about it, it makes my head hurt.

18:25.999 --> 18:30.043
Yeah, my head hurt when you were saying it too.

18:30.123 --> 18:36.308
Well, you know, it's just that keyboard controls are always weird for games, right?

18:36.488 --> 18:41.513
So, it made sense to me at that moment, but... I guess not.

18:41.533 --> 18:41.573
No.

18:41.693 --> 18:42.013
Uh-uh.

18:43.734 --> 18:44.055
Yeah.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.576
It's an honest mistake.

18:46.217 --> 18:47.197
That's kind of you.

18:48.553 --> 18:49.214
Thank you.

18:49.534 --> 18:50.295
Thank you.

18:50.435 --> 18:57.502
But, well, I'll do my best next time to maybe understand the game's controls better.

18:57.522 --> 18:58.243
You do need to.

18:59.164 --> 19:01.706
It's important for me to be able to help you, Moco-chan.

19:01.746 --> 19:02.427
But you don't.

19:03.088 --> 19:03.388
I do!

19:03.468 --> 19:06.371
Even yesterday you didn't want to help even though there was a controller.

19:06.411 --> 19:06.571
I did!

19:06.591 --> 19:08.413
You didn't take the controller in your own paws.

19:08.533 --> 19:08.873
I took it.

19:08.893 --> 19:10.235
You did after I yelled at you.

19:13.653 --> 19:20.257
But yes, I'll do my best not to misunderstand and okay, ruffians!

19:21.898 --> 19:23.559
BAU BAU!

19:24.219 --> 19:26.601
The ruffians are so kind though.

19:26.961 --> 19:30.223
It was just an honest mistake, alright?

19:30.524 --> 19:32.465
Thank you for agreeing.

19:32.485 --> 19:34.026
Moco-chan agrees.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.927
Okay, next thing, next thing.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.548
So, ruffians!

19:37.948 --> 19:41.211
I know, I talked about, you know, going to sleep yesterday.

19:41.231 --> 19:42.692
Only to happen.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.293
Yeah, yeah, it happens.

19:44.353 --> 19:45.614
Going to sleep happens.

19:46.034 --> 19:49.576
But, I was woken up only an hour after going to sleep, right?

19:50.797 --> 19:57.402
But, during that time, you know, I had a pretty cool dream!

19:59.743 --> 20:01.645
So, I had a dream.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.732
I don't know, this is so specific I feel.

20:20.743 --> 20:21.483
I can see it!

20:21.583 --> 20:22.363
I can see it!

20:22.503 --> 20:26.484
Yes, okay, but it was drawn in a very nostalgic sort of, like, natsukashii style.

20:26.805 --> 20:29.625
Maybe like pixel art or something like that.

20:29.905 --> 20:30.685
It was very cute.

20:30.706 --> 20:31.946
They were all very happy, okay?

20:31.986 --> 20:35.027
Happy squirrels running together, pixelized.

20:35.047 --> 20:35.987
Good wallpaper.

20:36.327 --> 20:47.370
But, the thing is, is that when you looked at it from a different angle, you could see more into the world and more things, like stuff behind them in different angles.

20:48.470 --> 20:48.630
So,

20:49.370 --> 20:54.534
It was very detailed and I could see like different train lines behind them and buildings.

20:54.994 --> 20:57.316
But then suddenly I could see Godzilla.

20:58.337 --> 21:02.500
And then some buildings looked more like the main street, the Chuo Dori and Akihabara.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.062
And then there was Mahoro from Mahoromatic.

21:07.363 --> 21:10.826
It was a very immersive wallpaper experience.

21:10.946 --> 21:11.546
Oh yeah.

21:12.847 --> 21:13.628
And then I woke up.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.230
And I didn't have the wallpaper.

21:18.399 --> 21:21.042
Is there any way I can get a wallpaper like this now?

21:22.924 --> 21:26.368
Is there fancy ones now?

21:32.255 --> 21:33.437
Is nothing new like that?

21:33.517 --> 21:33.897
Yes!

21:33.957 --> 21:36.680
There's wallpapers like that now!

21:38.419 --> 21:38.959
I don't know.

21:38.979 --> 21:46.043
For now, our desktop wallpaper is still the Advent Debut Key Visual, which I'm very happy with.

21:46.503 --> 21:49.565
But you know, if there's cool new wallpapers, I would like to see them.

21:49.925 --> 21:50.245
Why?

21:50.466 --> 21:53.787
Dreams can be flying high!

21:54.748 --> 21:56.909
We follow your cursor?

21:58.690 --> 22:01.852
That's pretty cool, but it's not as cool as seeing things at different angles high.

22:02.032 --> 22:07.455
Could you imagine if the Advent Debut Key Visual, if we all followed the cursor?

22:10.580 --> 22:11.601
Oh my gosh.

22:11.701 --> 22:14.543
That would be cool.

22:14.643 --> 22:19.026
I think that Moco-chan, that our wallpaper will probably never change.

22:19.426 --> 22:20.066
Probably.

22:20.147 --> 22:20.587
Yeah.

22:20.967 --> 22:22.608
It's probably gonna be forever this.

22:22.988 --> 22:24.149
Actually, I don't think so.

22:24.169 --> 22:24.790
What?

22:24.950 --> 22:25.210
Why?

22:26.210 --> 22:27.131
Nevermind!

22:28.072 --> 22:29.553
BAU BAU!

22:29.593 --> 22:34.076
Well, that was an interesting dream, Moco-chan.

22:34.096 --> 22:35.517
I think there's a...

22:37.018 --> 22:37.458
I don't know.

22:37.478 --> 22:40.740
Ruffians!

22:40.820 --> 22:42.501
Let's check out some of your submissions.

22:42.521 --> 22:44.562
Starting with the Doggie of the Day!

22:44.642 --> 22:48.345
We have... De-den!

22:48.745 --> 22:48.925
Why?

22:48.965 --> 22:51.346
The Doggie of the Day today is me!

22:51.766 --> 22:53.087
Not Fuwawa.

22:54.048 --> 22:55.088
Not Fuwawa.

22:55.549 --> 22:58.010
The Doggie of the Day is not Fuwawa.

22:58.130 --> 22:59.671
It's me!

23:00.071 --> 23:00.471
It's me!

23:03.593 --> 23:06.335
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

23:33.893 --> 23:34.934
Mii is a bear.

23:34.954 --> 23:37.015
I love those silly eyes.

23:37.075 --> 23:39.737
Hey Moco-chan, do you think you could make the same face as Mii there?

23:39.957 --> 23:42.478
Or BAU BAU-ing into a fan?

23:42.878 --> 23:49.222
Ah, like a... Is that the sound Mii makes?

23:49.262 --> 23:51.423
That's the sound of Mii in front of the fan.

23:51.443 --> 23:52.203
That's how Mii BAU BAU-s.

23:52.284 --> 23:53.764
Yes, in front of the fan!

23:54.225 --> 23:58.367
You know when it's just quiet, but then you're in front of the fan and you're like...

23:59.275 --> 24:01.396
And the AC is just right.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.118
Like that!

24:06.138 --> 24:10.359
I don't know, I think Mii-chan would probably be like BAU!

24:10.380 --> 24:16.962
Wait, it's in the fan, right?

24:18.303 --> 24:20.844
Moco-chan, it has to have the fan sound.

24:20.924 --> 24:22.124
I can't do that!

24:22.204 --> 24:27.526
BAU!

24:27.746 --> 24:28.947
I don't know, I don't know.

24:30.627 --> 24:31.648
Good reason.

24:31.688 --> 24:33.009
Mii needs it.

24:33.189 --> 24:33.469
Really.

24:46.667 --> 24:47.828
Safety is number one.

24:47.848 --> 24:49.689
Do we not want more singing?

24:49.709 --> 24:50.450
Maybe not sometimes.

25:02.678 --> 25:06.340
Yeah, but me, me is a very, very good friend.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.781
Very good friend, yes.

25:08.661 --> 25:12.163
BAU BAU!

25:12.223 --> 25:13.023
Cute.

25:13.383 --> 25:14.044
And more!

25:14.404 --> 25:16.005
Today I went on a walk.

25:16.045 --> 25:16.185
Walk?

25:16.305 --> 25:17.165
Where did we go to?

25:17.265 --> 25:19.726
We have de-den!

25:19.746 --> 25:22.688
So cute!

25:22.708 --> 25:28.891
It sort of looks like one of the winter romance movies.

25:30.673 --> 25:32.397
The perfect day spot.

25:33.620 --> 25:36.206
It'd be nice to go there one more time.

25:36.987 --> 25:39.272
You can drink the apple cider.

25:40.834 --> 25:43.376
Have lots of apple cider, not hot choco.

25:43.396 --> 25:45.057
Not hot Mococo.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.278
Not hot choco.

26:06.225 --> 26:07.986
BAU BAU!

26:08.827 --> 26:11.888
And then we have our question of the day.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.770
We have... De-den!

26:15.130 --> 26:16.091
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

26:16.131 --> 26:16.691
Good morning!

26:16.731 --> 26:18.192
Quick question.

26:18.472 --> 26:21.414
Since Pero is your demon dog master mentor.

26:21.614 --> 26:21.914
Hi.

26:22.014 --> 26:22.515
Mentor.

26:22.755 --> 26:23.395
Mentor.

26:23.435 --> 26:26.357
He's just a pet, really.

26:26.457 --> 26:28.198
Please don't let him know, okay?

26:30.270 --> 26:39.536
Would this mean that once you become masters yourself that you would transform into a form similar to Pero's squishy physique?

26:40.037 --> 26:42.138
BAU BAU!

26:42.579 --> 26:45.761
FUWAMOCO similar to Pero.

26:47.970 --> 26:50.032
Hi!

26:50.833 --> 26:54.677
Why would that ever happen?

26:54.697 --> 26:57.280
Has anything given you that impression?

26:57.761 --> 27:01.104
That we would transform into something so grotesque?

27:02.386 --> 27:04.368
You know, Hale is Pero.

27:04.848 --> 27:05.809
He's our mentor.

27:06.630 --> 27:08.452
You know, Papa Puppy.

27:08.592 --> 27:10.333
Does Papa Puppy look like Pero?

27:10.594 --> 27:12.335
No, that would be awful.

27:13.296 --> 27:15.318
You know, we have more than just two bones.

27:15.338 --> 27:16.619
We're fluffy!

27:16.979 --> 27:17.540
We're fuzzy!

27:17.580 --> 27:17.900
Yeah.

27:19.867 --> 27:21.489
Master Koi Dogs!

27:21.529 --> 27:22.750
Master Koi Dogs FUWAMOCO!

27:44.037 --> 27:45.438
BAU BAU!

27:56.028 --> 28:00.230
Next, we have a very important stream coming up.

28:00.250 --> 28:00.370
We do!

28:00.711 --> 28:02.072
Our next stream is... De-den!

28:02.232 --> 28:07.315
We're playing Play It Up together with all of Advent unit.

28:07.415 --> 28:07.916
Right!

28:08.376 --> 28:13.960
But more important, we have a very big announcement!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.082
An announcement from all of us.

28:17.502 --> 28:20.524
And we really want you to be there to hear it first, okay?

28:20.624 --> 28:21.024
Okay!

28:22.245 --> 28:23.226
You'll be there, right?

28:23.266 --> 28:24.006
You'll be there!

28:26.467 --> 28:27.488
It's gonna be fun!

28:28.648 --> 28:29.068
It is!

28:29.108 --> 28:32.690
But we're really, really excited to share this announcement with you!

28:32.890 --> 28:34.971
Please be there, okay?

28:35.391 --> 28:38.053
Pero already spoiled the announcement.

28:38.773 --> 28:39.093
Huh?

28:39.954 --> 28:40.234
What?

28:41.695 --> 28:42.015
What?

28:45.236 --> 28:46.817
Oh my gosh, that's a big deal.

28:48.058 --> 28:49.578
Wait, what?

28:49.638 --> 28:50.499
What do you know?

28:51.593 --> 28:52.594
What do you know?

28:53.435 --> 28:53.895
Tell us.

28:54.696 --> 28:55.176
Tell us.

28:55.196 --> 28:58.839
Huh?

29:00.661 --> 29:03.103
Do we have to get Mane-chan involved now?

29:03.143 --> 29:04.143
You can't tell us!

29:04.864 --> 29:06.705
Do we have to get Mane-chan involved?

29:06.725 --> 29:11.349
Oh my gosh, this is gonna become a... A big... A big problem.

29:11.409 --> 29:12.210
A cup of war.

29:12.310 --> 29:13.091
A cup of war.

29:13.111 --> 29:14.172
Wow.

29:16.547 --> 29:23.029
For ruffians that weren't there, that didn't have Pero spoil everything, you'll have to join us to find out too!

29:23.189 --> 29:28.090
From FUWAMOCO and Nerissa and Shiori and people's mouths!

29:28.170 --> 29:29.271
What does he know, huh?

29:34.312 --> 29:35.313
BAU BAU!

29:35.893 --> 29:39.095
And our schedule!

29:39.115 --> 29:47.500
Well, on Saturday we're gonna be going back to Super Mario Wonder after Ina-senpai's 3D birthday concert.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.662
You haven't forgotten, right, Ruffians?

29:49.742 --> 29:51.083
We have not.

29:52.003 --> 29:55.165
But we're looking really, really forward to it.

29:56.066 --> 30:01.169
And you know, it's been a little while, so we'll have a nice, sweet time playing together again.

30:01.249 --> 30:02.210
No scary stuff.

30:03.070 --> 30:06.693
Not becoming an elephant.

30:06.974 --> 30:08.455
And that's all we've got.

30:08.755 --> 30:14.620
Thank you so much for joining us today, Ruffians, for another FUWAMOCO Morning.

30:15.121 --> 30:21.626
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special Ruffians today!
