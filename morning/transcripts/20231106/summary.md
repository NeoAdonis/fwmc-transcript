## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (06:56)

[LoneBushido](https://twitter.com/FlameBushidoNo1/status/1719017559758889107) found Pero while trying out their new FUWAMOCO bowling ball.

## hololive Minecraft Sport Festival (08:34)

Their training bore fruits, and FUWAMOCO along with the Red Team achieved victory in the [Minecraft Sports Festival 2023](https://youtu.be/QBMF6LN1QyU)!

## Confession (10:37)

Even though she wasn't participating, Fuwawa was able to support Mococo by allowing her to use her arm as a hand rest. It seems that it worked out and allowed Moco-chan to rest her hands properly.

## Minecraft Photo (13:06)

In the end however, the twins were able to take a [picture together](https://twitter.com/FUWAMOCO_en/status/1720788581801976235/photo/1)! Papa puppy gave them a laptop that, although old, allowed Fuwawa to join Mococo in their victory celebration.

## Misunderstanding (15:12)

No misunderstandings today! Ruffians are shocked.

## Goodbye Daylight Time (16:27)

Aligned with the U.S. and Canada, clocks in the Northwest Passage went back 1 hour, causing FUWAMOCO's stream schedule to shift as well. The sisters apologize for the inconvenience this might cause to Ruffians not observing Daylight Time changes.

## Haachama-senpai (18:38)

FUWAMOCO joined Haachama during her [call-in stream](https://youtu.be/_U--hP9-WyY?t=4480)!

## VR Radio (20:45)

FUWAMOCO's Opening Song, ["Lifetime Showtime"](https://youtu.be/-wzgy7uTuSk), was [broadcasted on NHK's ぶいあーる！～VTuberの音楽Radio～](https://twitter.com/nhk_vtuberradio/status/1721173523614298148)!

## Natto Challenge (22:32)

To change things up, Mococo tried dry natto for today's challenge. [It doesn't make a difference on her disdain...](https://youtu.be/V5v4Na0j9Ro?t=1596)

## Doggie of the Day (29:41)

[rad shiva](https://twitter.com/temenel/status/1715703687241162770) shares a pic of eight-year-old Kira!

## Today I Went On A Walk (31:34)

While listening ["mumei"](https://youtu.be/oA0CpI0vCK4) on their way back home, [@Jup1ter_TTJ](https://twitter.com/Jup1ter_TTJ/status/1719167633273336032) takes a look to a faraway city...

## Question Of The Day (32:33)

[@rotflolmaomgeez](https://twitter.com/rotflolmaomgeez/status/1719874170618589195) ask if FUWAMOCO have any rituals before or after a stream? On FWMC Morning days, they wake up early and get prepared (see [ep. 33](https://youtu.be/f270ObaKNZw?t=1834)). They also use to be on Twitter before and after a stream.
