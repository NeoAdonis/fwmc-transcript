## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (08:05)

[@TdesuJ](https://twitter.com/TdesuJ/status/1717024018371432637) was visited by Pero who was demanding candy. After he ran off, this Ruffian carved his face in a pumpkin so as to not forget it.

## Biboo's "Loveit?" Cover (10:08)

Don't miss fellow Advent member [Koseki Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/@KosekiBijou)'s [2nd cover "Loveit?"](https://youtu.be/NfhJK602XdE)!

## BAUtime (11:48)

Have you felt that the last 3 months have went by too quickly? FUWAMOCO give us their thoughts on the phenomenon known as "BAUtime".

## Confession (15:02)

Mococo reveals the real reason why her mouth is shaped like a cat, and it's of course so she can fit small kittens heads easily! Although in reality, it seems that this was just a joke. *Unless…*

## Special Day (17:57)

Fuwawa is concerned that Ruffians don't know that a special date for FUWAMOCO is approaching. At that moment FUWAMOCO had only found one single Ruffian who correctly guessed it.

## FUWAMOCO's 2nd Cover Song (20:14)

FUWAMOCO reveal their next cover: it's [syudou's "Cute na Kanojo"](https://youtu.be/XYmZUh_YAq0)! A song with spooky vibes to fit perfectly with the season.

## Halloween Memories (22:36)

FUWAMOCO tell Ruffians about a small memory from their childhood, when they went to watch some fireworks with their family on a Halloween day, and Fuwawa accidentally dropped the gum that she was chewing on Mama puppy's hair.

## Doggie of the Night (25:45)

From [hololulz](https://twitter.com/hololulz/status/1709663409103401263) we have B-Man, who seems perplexed by the zombie head that they made.

## Walk of the Night (28:19)

[bardiche](https://twitter.com/katxts/status/1718664352444698747) visited the famous Castle Bran, a.k.a. Dracula's Castle. This Ruffian shared some photos of the event that was hosted there last weekend.

## Question of the Night (29:38)

[Blazecake](https://twitter.com/Blazecake20/status/1706887023783563752) asks if there are types of "BAU BAU" other than "BAU BAU⤴︎⤴︎" and "bau bau⤵︎⤵︎". It seems that there are more sets of "BAU BAU" that can be used to convey other feelings! However, these might be also harder to understand for humans.
