00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:16.130
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:21.779
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.584
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:29.149
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.995
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:38.782
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:46.832
It's Friday, and it's also our 160th episode today!

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:49.776
Thank you for your support!

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:53.380
That's a lot of mornings, Moco-chan.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.388
Thank you, Ruffians, for waking up for 160 mornings together with us!

00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:01.568
BAU BAU!

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.733
Well, for the Ruffians, maybe this is your first morning with us!

00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:13.340
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short, warm-up morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:15.462
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:18.906
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:23.130
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.512
On the right paw.

00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:29.801
So to do that, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.163
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:31.604 --> 00:06:39.617
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:41.079
BAU BAU!

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.483
Ruffians, did you remember your BAU BAU?

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:43.603
Yeah!

00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:44.785
Yeah!

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:45.827
Are you awake?

00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:47.109
Are you awake?

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.291
Yeah!

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.444
Today is a morning, a Friday morning.

00:06:54.925 --> 00:06:57.849
Are we gonna start it off on the right paw?

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.813
Okay, Ruffians.

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.455
Close enough.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.899
You might be awake, but who knows?

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:05.840
I think you're awake.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.302
I think you're awake.

00:07:07.322 --> 00:07:08.143
It's just a guess.

00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:11.308
Definitely, yeah.

00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:12.289
BAU BAU!

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:13.451
BAU BAU!

00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:14.793
You're still a little sleepy.

00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:18.858
In that case... BAU BAU!

00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:20.100
In that case...

00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:22.345
I have some news for you.

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:27.392
News?

00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:31.678
Ruffians!

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:32.439
News Moco-chan.

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:36.604
FUWAMOCO Mornings don't end easy.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:39.168
No.

00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.512
That's good news then.

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:43.033
No bad news.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:56.947
It's not as bad as I'm thinking though.

00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:58.932
Let's take a look.

00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:00.076
Let's take a look.

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:03.245
Okay, where is Pero Sighting now?

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:06.895
De-den!

00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:08.220
Hi.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.300
Hi.

00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:08.981
Hi.

00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:09.542
Hi.

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:11.566
Hi.

00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:11.806
Hi.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:11.986
Hi.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:12.207
Hi.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.411
Hi.

00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:17.677
Hi.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:19.080
Hi.

00:08:19.621 --> 00:08:19.681
Hi.

00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:19.881
Hi.

00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:20.622
Hi.

00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:22.526
Hi.

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:22.927
Hi.

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:29.659
Hi.

00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:33.567
I don't like eating acrylic.

00:08:33.587 --> 00:08:36.671
I feel like if he wanted to, he could.

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:38.093
He could definitely.

00:08:38.113 --> 00:08:38.634
He could.

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:39.775
It's an option for him.

00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:48.027
It's probably not the most delicious, but... Hopefully he didn't because, you know, those are precious, precious treasures.

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:51.271
But I guess, yeah, this would probably be a pretty good home for him.

00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:55.978
He kind of does blend in to some degree, but he's not acrylic!

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:57.159
No!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.882
He's not acrylic!

00:08:59.182 --> 00:08:59.983
He's caramel!

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:04.795
I didn't say it, that's what the Ruffians were saying!

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:08.079
I don't know if that's factual.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.281
Not that big.

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:14.506
I didn't say it, the Ruffians did.

00:09:14.526 --> 00:09:17.950
But, but, but, I could say it, the Ruffians!

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.332
The precious treasures!

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:22.414
Pero, we need to get Pero out of there!

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:25.718
If we don't see them, they must be in his tummy, huh?

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.136
Well, uh, I'm gonna hold this somewhere, and not just the tummy.

00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:33.461
If they're in the tummy, then you're gonna have to take things into your own paws, Ruffians!

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:44.759
But you know, I think one thing, if we look at this picture very well, I think this Ruffian's gonna be needing some more room for new treasures that maybe come along the way soon.

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:46.662
Yeah.

00:09:46.682 --> 00:09:50.768
Right, maybe this Ruffian also has to learn how to be a surgeon.

00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:53.292
Yeah.

00:09:53.744 --> 00:09:58.133
You had to make room and obviously you don't have room for nasty demon dogs.

00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:06.229
That's all.

00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:08.513
Be safe about it, you might bite back.

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:13.718
You have to be careful.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:14.058
BAU BAU!

00:10:14.078 --> 00:10:15.761
Be careful always, okay?

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.603
You have to keep your eyes open.

00:10:18.044 --> 00:10:18.885
BAU BAU!

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:21.129
Happy news!

00:10:27.057 --> 00:10:27.919
Today!

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:28.640
Today!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.183
Today, fresh news!

00:10:32.886 --> 00:10:35.930
It's Nobuko-senpai's birthday!

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.491
BAU BAU!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:37.032
Happy birthday!

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:41.177
FUWAMOCO-senpai!

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:42.519
It's her birthday!

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:46.924
She just finished having her 3D birthday live!

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:53.032
Actually, I heard that this is her first birthday live in two years!

00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:55.455
Seems hard to believe!

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:56.456
I don't believe it.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:57.878
Right!

00:10:58.078 --> 00:10:59.240
Two years?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.361
Amazing!

00:11:01.943 --> 00:11:02.724
Really?

00:11:02.784 --> 00:11:02.884
Yeah!

00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:10.189
But I'm so glad, I'm so glad we got another Roboco-senpai 3D birthday!

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:14.354
And an amazing set that's filled with really cool songs like Odor!

00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:14.915
But!

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:15.436
But?

But

00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:32.476
Even better!

00:11:32.496 --> 00:11:33.338
It's really cute.

00:11:33.398 --> 00:11:37.125
I love the odango, the big odango.

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:39.329
The buttons, they're so cute.

00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:41.153
Kind of like ears, you know.

00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:41.353
Big ears.

00:11:41.373 --> 00:11:42.716
Yeah, like big ears.

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:43.457
Very stylish.

00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:46.583
I feel like Roboco-senpai is always very stylish.

00:11:46.643 --> 00:11:48.226
Very stylish, yeah.

00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:51.973
We have the really cool umbrella too, you know.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.206
Rest down or dress up with the umbrella and then the jacket with a bit of plush bed too.

00:11:58.787 --> 00:12:01.570
So cool, very very stylish.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.915
Just thinking, I wonder which hololive member has the most amount of glasses for FUWAMOCO.

00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:09.478
I feel like Roboco-senpai has a lot of glasses now.

00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:13.001
That's true, but I don't think she's the number one.

00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:16.425
I'm curious who's the number one glasses owner.

00:12:18.093 --> 00:12:20.797
It's a good question, yes!

00:12:20.817 --> 00:12:27.105
But you know, Dobuko-senpai... I just, I love Dobuko-senpai's singing voice.

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:28.467
It's so unique.

00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:33.094
So I feel so lucky that we got another CD live.

00:12:33.114 --> 00:12:35.096
And I hope we get more originals too.

00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:37.840
I love Dobuko-senpai's originals, but...

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:49.476
On the topic of new music too, Roboco-senpai also just released a brand new song cover of Oni no Utage, Demon's Banquet.

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.159
So please check it out!

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:54.623
Extra extra cool Roboco-senpai straight to you, Carol fans!

00:12:57.227 --> 00:12:57.387
BAU BAU!

00:12:57.407 --> 00:12:57.988
Happy birthday Roboco-senpai!

00:12:57.968 --> 00:13:00.193
Bye!

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:09.733
There's so many happy things, exciting things going on and Nerissa's gonna be having her first 3D content very soon too!

00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:10.455
Lots of stuff!

00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:13.902
Lots and lots of stuff!

00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:18.213
It's FUWAMOCO News!

00:13:18.233 --> 00:13:24.108
We're happy to say that we finished all our sightings!

00:13:24.248 --> 00:13:27.737
All the sightings for our birthday!

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:28.920
Ruffians!

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.927
Maybe our birthday merch is getting just that much closer to reaching you!

00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:34.789
Yeah!

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:40.317
And you know this time, Mayuri-chan, she was praising us and we've gotten so much faster!

00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:40.497
Right!

00:13:40.517 --> 00:13:44.143
You know, it was to the point where we were like, do we make a mistake?

00:13:44.303 --> 00:13:45.404
Is this enough?

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:45.645
Right!

00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:51.233
So we double checked and we triple checked to make sure that we didn't forget a bunch of them or something.

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:51.994
But no!

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:54.939
Yeah!

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:55.159
We did it!

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:55.279
Yeah!

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.604
Are there any extra special ones?

00:13:57.624 --> 00:13:59.868
I always wonder about that.

00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:03.496
Sometimes I'm like, oh maybe this one didn't turn out right.

00:14:03.516 --> 00:14:05.940
But then I look at it and no, it looks the same.

00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:09.728
I always wonder though, you know, what happens to the extras?

00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:13.575
Who knows?

00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:17.503
I only messed up a couple times this time.

00:14:18.428 --> 00:14:19.169
10 times.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.293
Is there any SSL sneeze cards?

00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:23.895
I don't think so.

00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:25.277
Not this time.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.819
But very very careful.

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:27.700
Yes!

00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:33.588
Although, my hands were feeling a bit dry at one point, so I put on some hand cream.

00:14:33.668 --> 00:14:36.592
Yeah, and then I thought, oh, let's just put on hand cream.

00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:37.753
You know that one, right?

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:42.120
What if we get the oil and the cream out?

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.600
Right!

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.905
That's what I was worried about.

00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:46.045
Oh no!

00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:46.947
The cards don't smell really good!

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:48.689
Maybe you could smell the cards to see.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.053
Does it smell like FUWAMOCO?

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:52.315
Scratch and sniff cards!

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.620
Don't scratch them!

00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:56.541
Okay.

00:14:56.621 --> 00:14:59.826
But you know, we always have a bunch of fun stuff.

00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:05.213
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:05.794 --> 00:15:28.142
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:30.306
That makes us so happy.

00:15:30.686 --> 00:15:33.351
And we just listen to really cool music too.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:37.257
I don't know, we kind of go into like a happy trance while doing it, right?

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.505
Yeah, at one point though, I fell asleep.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.069
Not while signing, in the middle of signature.

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:45.171
No, I just paused.

00:15:45.191 --> 00:15:49.839
I just leaned back into a quick ten minute nap and then I was like, okay!

00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:50.620
Back to it.

00:15:50.802 --> 00:15:55.030
But you know, it really is special.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.273
So we're really excited to have them.

00:15:57.474 --> 00:15:59.457
Reach your paws open!

00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:02.022
And hand pain status.

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:04.066
Good.

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:05.067
Good.

00:16:05.087 --> 00:16:05.668
I think good.

00:16:05.688 --> 00:16:06.670
Right, Moco-chan?

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.073
I would say 0%.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:08.493
0%.

00:16:08.794 --> 00:16:10.777
I had a cat mark in my paw.

00:16:11.198 --> 00:16:12.661
But otherwise I'm good.

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:13.042
Yeah.

00:16:13.462 --> 00:16:14.464
Yeah.

00:16:14.444 --> 00:16:16.896
Pretty good.

00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:22.362
And on that note, that's good because we just found out that we'll be getting...

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:37.246
Ruffians!

00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:48.079
If you get this up right now, you can still get the special foil stamp signature cards!

00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:51.049
I like it better too, Abyss.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:55.053
I like the foil stamp on better, so please don't feel like I can get delimited!

00:16:55.874 --> 00:16:57.415
Yeah, I know.

00:16:57.435 --> 00:16:57.936
I just like it better.

00:16:57.956 --> 00:17:00.378
You can still get your paws on it right now, Ruffians!

00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:04.602
Pre-orders end at the end of this month, a little bit at the beginning of next month.

00:17:04.642 --> 00:17:06.103
So soon, right?

00:17:06.563 --> 00:17:10.987
So please check them out for good!

00:17:11.007 --> 00:17:11.168
BAU BAU!

00:17:11.188 --> 00:17:14.611
I'm not looking forward to sighting more, it's too hot.

00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:17.854
BAU BAU!

00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:18.174
It's just nice.

00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:18.855
It's relaxing.

00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:19.315
Yeah.

00:17:19.295 --> 00:17:23.922
Moco-chan's the fastest at signing doors.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:26.436
But that makes sense.

00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:36.565
We have a new group of plushies!

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:41.375
That was just announced!

00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:50.635
A series of plushies are coming out with the plushie maker Make Shoe!

00:17:50.615 --> 00:17:52.878
Ugh, makeshift's a little bit different.

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:53.299
Right!

00:17:53.879 --> 00:17:57.324
For these plushies to become reality, you need to find them!

00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:57.685
Yes!

00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:01.109
I want to put my voice towards this!

00:18:01.209 --> 00:18:03.132
I want this!

00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:05.014
But!

00:18:05.034 --> 00:18:05.475
It already happened!

00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:06.917
You did it, Ruffian!

00:18:07.257 --> 00:18:09.220
It'll be coming to reality!

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.844
Thank you so much for all your support!

00:18:11.984 --> 00:18:13.286
For supporting all of it!

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:16.590
And you know this time, look!

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.733
We're all kind of really cute beans!

00:18:19.093 --> 00:18:20.335
Bean shapes!

00:18:20.315 --> 00:18:23.761
FUWAMOCO On top of a fan mascot!

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:25.685
FUWAMOCO Look at the pebble there.

00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:28.530
Pebble's kinda big compared to the jailbird.

00:18:28.551 --> 00:18:28.851
FUWAMOCO Right.

00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:30.434
FUWAMOCO Right, the big pebble.

00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:34.582
FUWAMOCO I feel like the pebble could eat the jailbird.

00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:35.043
FUWAMOCO Hi.

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:36.345
FUWAMOCO Is that what we're gonna do, Moco-chan?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.868
FUWAMOCO I could take that jailbird!

00:18:38.438 --> 00:18:40.281
BAU BAU!

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:44.649
But you know, we saw a number of Ruffians kind of, huh?

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:45.831
Wait, huh?

00:18:46.472 --> 00:18:50.940
Fuwa's on top of the pink Ruffian, Moco-chan's on top of the blue Ruffian.

00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:51.961
What?

00:18:51.981 --> 00:18:52.843
What is this about?

00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:54.586
The pairing doesn't make sense to me.

00:18:54.606 --> 00:18:56.650
Did they make a mistake?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.172
No Ruffians!

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.396
I know I mentioned it a little bit before.

00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:02.900
But maybe there's some Ruffians that forgot.

00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:06.827
But that's because they're both Ruffians!

00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:10.854
The blue Ruffian is not Fuwawa, I'm blue.

00:19:11.074 --> 00:19:14.841
But the blue Ruffian is my Ruffian, the pink Ruffian.

00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:17.044
No, Moco-chan's Ruffian.

00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:21.051
Ruffian's a Ruffian, you know.

00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.255
You know, this was a request that we made.

00:19:24.736 --> 00:19:26.558
We wanted it this way, yes!

00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:39.495
We hope that you understand that, you know, a Ruffian is a Ruffian, and every Ruffian is here to sing us all, you know, me, Fuwawa, and me, Mococo, and Fuwamoco, together.

00:19:39.515 --> 00:19:40.036
Yeah.

00:19:41.077 --> 00:19:41.317
Makes sense.

00:19:42.379 --> 00:19:49.468
But yeah, you know, something a little bit different than maybe open to now, or what you expect.

00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:52.292
Throwing your expectations out of the water.

00:19:52.312 --> 00:19:57.559
But we hope you'll check them out, Ruffians, over on MiiChip's website.

00:20:00.443 --> 00:20:02.926
BAU BAU!

00:20:02.947 --> 00:20:05.190
Even when you're cheering on FUWAMOCO.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.171
Exactly.

00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:08.094
Are they limited?

00:20:08.114 --> 00:20:10.978
I'm not too sure.

00:20:11.218 --> 00:20:14.242
I don't know.

00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:16.605
It's best to go check them out if you're telling us.

00:20:16.926 --> 00:20:18.628
Check out the website and there will be an answer.

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:22.893
BAU BAU!

00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:26.767
I would say though, Shiori looks very cute, very smiley.

00:20:26.787 --> 00:20:30.660
Biboo has a Kirby feeling to her too, you know.

00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:37.134
FUWAMOCO I love it so much!

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:42.160
FUWAMOCO Very cute.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.462
All together Advent!

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:56.496
BAU BAU!

00:20:56.476 --> 00:21:04.269
And, well, I know that we mentioned it earlier, but this weekend is a big weekend, Ruffians!

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:12.081
Because, well, FUWAMOCO, we have a big performance over at Anime Boston!

00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:21.977
For the first time ever in the USA, there's going to be a super karaoke party with hololive memes!

00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:26.544
And it's happening in Boston!

00:21:28.107 --> 00:21:29.749
Moco-chan how are you feeling?

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.891
Nervous.

00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:37.461
How do I say that in Boston style?

00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:39.244
Nervous.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:39.645
Is that?

00:21:40.846 --> 00:21:42.910
Is that sound more like Boston?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.754
It's how they say nervous in Boston.

00:21:46.915 --> 00:21:49.800
I'm wicked nervous.

00:21:51.003 --> 00:21:52.946
I'm wicked nervous over here.

00:21:54.349 --> 00:21:56.193
Does that make you better?

00:21:58.176 --> 00:21:59.639
Drop the ice, drop the ice.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.430
I'm wicked nervous.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.995
I'm wicked excited.

00:22:08.195 --> 00:22:18.961
You know, I think we're a bit of both.

00:22:18.982 --> 00:22:26.119
But we're gonna do our best, you know, not to get too stiff or freeze up, you know.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:30.187
Yeah, we're just gonna have fun and karaoke all together again!

00:22:30.207 --> 00:22:32.030
You know, karaoke's just like that.

00:22:32.772 --> 00:22:39.024
But for the Ruffians that might not be able to go all the way to Boston, you know, that makes sense sometimes.

00:22:39.404 --> 00:22:40.226
We'll do our best!

00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:44.454
We're gonna do our best and hopefully we'll have some photos to share with you!

00:22:44.795 --> 00:22:46.538
I'm not sure about videos.

00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:50.021
But, if we can, we win this song.

00:22:50.822 --> 00:22:55.867
But also, you know, it's not just gonna be us and Bii-senpai there.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.491
Also, FUWAMOCO English -Justice-!

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:04.456
They have Elizabeth, Gigi, Sissy, and Nala there too!

00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:07.759
They're gonna be doing something different from us all.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:10.081
They're gonna be doing their own panel.

00:23:10.342 --> 00:23:14.025
And they're doing... Meet and Greet.

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:15.647
Moco-chan, are you jealous?

00:23:18.749 --> 00:23:23.075
Well, we get to see so many Ruffians!

00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:28.684
I am now a part of hololive English -Justice-!

00:23:29.264 --> 00:23:30.787
I could replace Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:31.287
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.150
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:34.292
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:34.612
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:34.632 --> 00:23:34.973
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:34.993 --> 00:23:35.313
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:37.937
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:37.957 --> 00:23:38.378
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:38.398 --> 00:23:38.698
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:38.718 --> 00:23:39.039
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:39.359
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:39.740
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.060
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.381
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:40.721
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:41.202
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:41.562
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:41.582 --> 00:23:41.963
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:44.166
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:44.186 --> 00:23:44.487
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:44.907
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:44.987 --> 00:23:45.348
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:45.368 --> 00:23:45.688
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:46.009
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.349
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:47.111 --> 00:23:47.411
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:47.431 --> 00:23:47.731
Naoraboko-chan!

00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:48.132
Na

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.261
Yeah.

00:23:52.672 --> 00:23:53.755
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:23:53.775 --> 00:23:54.999
I was convinced.

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:56.744
Just put on the hat.

00:23:56.764 --> 00:23:57.908
Put the hat on the cat.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.091
Yes.

00:23:59.111 --> 00:24:00.957
Except you're a demon dog, Moco-chan.

00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:04.676
I'm tired of people saying I misunderstand, huh?

00:24:05.837 --> 00:24:05.917
Huh?

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.665
But we hope, BAU BAUs, that you'll be there.

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:14.647
That you'll be able to cheer us on.

00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:17.570
And maybe you can visit Justice as well.

00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:24.798
We'll do our best to bring you the first hololive Mii Super Karaoke Party!

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:25.999
BAU BAU!

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:28.182
BAU BAU!

00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:29.765
You thought it was later than one?

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:30.726
No, it's this weekend.

00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:32.008
It's this weekend, yeah.

00:24:32.248 --> 00:24:33.210
Get ready for it!

00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:35.092
BAU BAU!

00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:37.856
BAU BAU!

00:24:37.877 --> 00:24:38.678
Well, in other news.

00:24:38.698 --> 00:24:39.920
Something strange happened.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.562
Something strange happened on Twitter.

00:24:44.486 --> 00:24:49.774
Well, I feel like FUWAMOCO, we're the only hololive English members that don't make weird tweets.

00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:53.860
And I think that says something.

00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:56.876
This is true Ruffians.

00:24:58.738 --> 00:25:00.660
We don't really tweet weird things, right?

00:25:02.202 --> 00:25:04.164
Well, can we say it first?

00:25:04.364 --> 00:25:07.067
You don't think this is true?

00:25:07.087 --> 00:25:07.908
I don't know.

00:25:07.968 --> 00:25:09.590
Fuwawa thinks our Twitter is normal.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.752
I think our Twitter is normal.

00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:13.774
We have to get weirder, Moco-chan.

00:25:13.794 --> 00:25:14.455
Whatever that means.

00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:16.557
We have to start tweeting every hour.

00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:19.020
BAU BAU.

00:25:19.726 --> 00:25:20.568
BAU BAU!

00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:22.551
We do teach at every hour!

00:25:22.952 --> 00:25:24.215
BAU BAU Buttercup!

00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:24.776
BAU BAU!

00:25:25.277 --> 00:25:26.419
Wicked Fuel.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.561
BAU BAU!

00:25:28.122 --> 00:25:29.284
I can't think of any dimensions.

00:25:30.887 --> 00:25:32.711
I can't think what my system would be!

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.655
It still sounds pretty normal, huh?

00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:37.220
I don't know, we have to become a BAU BAU Bot or something.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.947
Basically like that.

00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:41.127
BAU BAU!

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:46.555
It was a BAU BAU BAU kind of thing that was tweeted by Kari-senpai!

00:25:46.895 --> 00:25:48.898
She made kind of a strange tweet.

00:25:49.018 --> 00:25:50.521
What did it mean?

00:25:51.161 --> 00:25:53.905
All she said was just, I love orange woman.

00:25:54.606 --> 00:25:58.873
So you know, I'm like, what about Fuwawa?

00:25:59.674 --> 00:26:02.658
And I took that as a challenge to become orange.

00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:06.844
And so, I became orange!

00:26:06.824 --> 00:26:08.486
Orange, orange!

00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:10.207
Orange, orange!

00:26:11.188 --> 00:26:11.489
Orange Fuwawa!

00:26:12.109 --> 00:26:12.650
Yeah!

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:22.599
And it's sort of funny because I feel like it seems like Ruffians seem to think that Fuwawa says orange is sort of funny.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.120
Orange!

00:26:24.962 --> 00:26:25.642
Is this true?

00:26:25.682 --> 00:26:26.883
Orange!

00:26:27.204 --> 00:26:27.564
I'm orange!

00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.526
Not blue anymore!

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:30.447
Orange!

00:26:31.388 --> 00:26:31.628
Orange.

00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:35.592
Orange.

00:26:35.612 --> 00:26:36.152
Orange.

00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:36.713
Orange.

00:26:38.144 --> 00:26:38.985
But look!

00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:42.511
Somehow it kind of works, right Moco-chan?

00:26:43.532 --> 00:26:45.716
I'm very happy being blue though.

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:46.657
I like normal stuff.

00:26:47.479 --> 00:26:48.100
Yeah.

00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:53.348
But I think it worked out and I was able to do it pretty quickly.

00:26:54.169 --> 00:27:01.080
But, you know, it was getting kind of late and that's why, you know, probably Calli-senpai made the silly tweet and then I decided to

00:27:01.432 --> 00:27:03.214
Trying to get her attention.

00:27:03.234 --> 00:27:06.098
That's right, because it was late, you're blaming it on the time of night.

00:27:06.118 --> 00:27:06.238
Yeah.

00:27:06.258 --> 00:27:07.841
So you thought it would be funny?

00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:07.961
Yeah.

00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:08.642
Because it was late?

00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:09.202
Yeah.

00:27:09.743 --> 00:27:11.465
And then you know what?

00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:11.586
What?

00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:13.468
I was happy because I was like, yeah, I did it!

00:27:13.588 --> 00:27:14.690
I'm orange now!

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:15.992
Yeah!

00:27:16.012 --> 00:27:18.775
And then Moco-chan was like, what about Mococo?

00:27:19.356 --> 00:27:20.197
And I said no.

00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:24.343
It's not because I'm mean, FUWAMOCO!

00:27:24.803 --> 00:27:27.046
It's because- Because it was late.

00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:27.507
And I was tired.

00:27:30.035 --> 00:27:34.439
Time I spent on this.

00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:34.740
I'm Fuwawa!

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.301
Time I spent and now it's done.

00:27:36.642 --> 00:27:38.844
It wasn't that much though.

00:27:38.864 --> 00:27:40.746
But I did it in a kind of roundabout way.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.267
But I did it!

00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:44.349
So that's the important thing.

00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:48.033
I think the most important thing is that you're normal.

00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:49.234
I'm normal Moco-chan.

00:27:49.254 --> 00:27:49.775
Not orange.

00:27:51.216 --> 00:27:52.638
Can you give me more compliments?

00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:55.761
You are normal.

00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:57.142
A little fluffy.

00:27:57.162 --> 00:27:57.763
Normal.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.302
Normal.

00:28:01.503 --> 00:28:03.148
Like this.

00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:05.776
Average.

00:28:05.796 --> 00:28:05.996
Everyday.

00:28:06.016 --> 00:28:07.340
Just start, Moco-chan!

00:28:10.971 --> 00:28:11.533
BAU BAU!

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:23.737
Well, speaking of everyday... One thing I love that doesn't happen everyday, but it happens every FUWAMOCO morning... Is the Doggie of the Day!

00:28:23.757 --> 00:28:25.740
Doggie of the Day!

00:28:29.926 --> 00:28:31.609
Today's Doggie of the Day is... This!

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:32.390
It's PETA!

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:32.510
PETA!

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.071
Look at PETA!

00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:33.291
So fluffy!

00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:36.676
Now this is a fluffy dog, huh?

00:28:36.696 --> 00:28:38.278
Right, you know, look!

00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:41.503
Look, PETA and I, we still have the same little fluff, fluff...

00:28:41.483 --> 00:28:42.566
The Little Flips.

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:45.313
Yorai Hairstyles.

00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:45.634
Kizuna.

00:28:45.955 --> 00:28:47.198
Kizuna.

00:28:47.218 --> 00:28:48.662
It's Peanut.

00:28:49.524 --> 00:28:50.326
Look at us.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:52.512
Atsumi.

00:28:53.454 --> 00:28:55.740
Look at all the flowing hair.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.843
The longest.

00:28:56.823 --> 00:29:10.909
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:13.534 --> 00:29:19.084
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:22.655
No, but it's delicious.

00:29:23.256 --> 00:29:23.837
Delicious?

00:29:23.897 --> 00:29:25.218
Deliciously cute!

00:29:25.258 --> 00:29:27.001
Being kind eyes, yes.

00:29:27.021 --> 00:29:27.261
Yeah.

00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:31.065
But this makes Peanut a baby.

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.629
Right, baby Peanut?

00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:35.651
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Peanut BAU BAU?

00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:41.859
I feel like it's very... No.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.260
BAU!

00:29:44.662 --> 00:29:44.862
BAU!

00:29:46.144 --> 00:29:46.484
BAU!

00:29:46.504 --> 00:29:46.785
BAU BAU!

00:29:49.248 --> 00:29:49.628
BAU BAU!

00:29:50.097 --> 00:29:51.919
Very friendly, like an alarm.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.202
A bit alarming.

00:29:54.222 --> 00:29:55.364
A bit alarming!

00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:57.467
You know, I guess you know Peanuts a big dog.

00:29:58.888 --> 00:30:01.291
Very beautiful dog, but also a dog.

00:30:01.592 --> 00:30:02.293
A bit alarming.

00:30:03.374 --> 00:30:05.757
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:30:05.777 --> 00:30:09.682
But you know, Peanuts, I think we can tell that Peanuts is super sweetie.

00:30:10.323 --> 00:30:12.286
And is the definition of friendly.

00:30:13.167 --> 00:30:17.112
So that means we have to give all the head pats and belly rubs.

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:18.754
All of them.

00:30:19.949 --> 00:30:21.091
All of the belly rubs.

00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:22.333
Some of the head pats.

00:30:22.994 --> 00:30:23.655
The peanut.

00:30:24.657 --> 00:30:26.720
And maybe some treats too!

00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:31.688
BAU BAU!

00:30:31.708 --> 00:30:33.310
Thank you!

00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:35.574
And next we have one!

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:38.158
Today I went on a walk segment!

00:30:38.318 --> 00:30:38.999
Ruffians!

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.983
Where were you at walking, huh?

00:30:41.363 --> 00:30:42.445
Let's take a look!

00:30:43.346 --> 00:30:43.487
De-den!

00:30:43.707 --> 00:30:46.311
Wait, what is this?

00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:49.992
Oh, cute!

00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:53.075
A wrestling match with your son!

00:30:54.636 --> 00:30:55.337
Aww, too cute!

00:30:55.357 --> 00:30:57.098
Wow, thank you for being a fan of us!

00:30:57.118 --> 00:31:02.043
I didn't know taking us along a very special, extreme, violent moment.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.966
Ah, in case you didn't know, Ruffians!

00:31:05.826 --> 00:31:06.807
We didn't wrestle.

00:31:06.827 --> 00:31:08.529
We did do wrestling!

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:10.210
Real wrestling!

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.072
Does this make us professional wrestlers?

00:31:12.092 --> 00:31:16.416
I feel a little sad because I see that people have forgotten.

00:31:16.396 --> 00:31:24.285
I have not forgotten how hard we worked that we trained in our 3D debut!

00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:25.807
We fought to the death!

00:31:26.388 --> 00:31:27.910
Real blood!

00:31:31.113 --> 00:31:35.479
But you know, don't forget, Mococo won!

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:40.885
It's fine Moco-chan because I think there's a battle in order again.

00:31:42.923 --> 00:31:45.207
One day we'll be back and let us wrestle.

00:31:45.327 --> 00:31:47.411
Just you watch, okay Ruffians?

00:31:47.431 --> 00:31:48.313
But you better not forget!

00:31:49.014 --> 00:31:49.495
Okay!

00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:53.823
BAU BAU!

00:31:53.843 --> 00:31:54.805
We hope you enjoyed it!

00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:55.987
Extreme violence!

00:31:56.007 --> 00:31:58.292
BAU BAU!

00:31:58.312 --> 00:32:00.796
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:32:01.177 --> 00:32:03.902
Today's Question of the Day is...

00:32:04.439 --> 00:32:07.042
BAU BAU!

00:32:07.062 --> 00:32:07.222
Mama!

00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:08.804
I've wondered for a while.

00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:12.629
How impressive is your collection of Twitter bookmark folders?

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:20.018
I know one is for home decor ideas, and I've noticed you have art and clips at the ready for almost any situation.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:23.663
Do you each have a few personal folders?

00:32:24.464 --> 00:32:27.808
Well, I don't think it's probably as sophisticated as you think.

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:31.072
Um, we talked about a downloads folder, right?

00:32:31.092 --> 00:32:31.813
Don't I ask?

00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:35.507
A bit more organized in that way than that.

00:32:35.527 --> 00:32:36.168
A bit more.

00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:36.589
Yeah.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.654
You know, we have lots and lots and lots of book breaks.

00:32:40.074 --> 00:32:40.455
Yeah.

00:32:40.535 --> 00:32:46.083
But I think the busiest one is the folder that Mane-chan uses for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:46.103 --> 00:32:48.046
That makes sense, because Mane-chan is probably more organized.

00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:51.251
Yeah, but I did notice the Twitter's funny.

00:32:51.732 --> 00:32:56.760
And if you start scrolling a bunch, it will show things out of chronological order.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.601
That kind of makes it really difficult.

00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:59.083
How is that not surprising?

00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:03.075
I don't know, it makes things tricky though for Mane-chan, I think.

00:33:03.776 --> 00:33:06.382
And it makes it hard to stay organized too!

00:33:06.602 --> 00:33:08.827
And for our other folders as well!

00:33:09.388 --> 00:33:18.748
Yeah, we really like to be able to see the Ruffians' special tweets in different folders so that we can go back and look at them!

00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:19.690
We know ideas!

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:20.211
Oh, fanworks too!

00:33:20.512 --> 00:33:21.794
Yeah.

00:33:21.914 --> 00:33:28.963
But hopefully, you know, maybe there's a way that the bookmarks folder can get a little bit more organized in the future.

00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:30.625
Who knows though, it might just go poop.

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:32.587
Yeah.

00:33:32.627 --> 00:33:34.510
I think that's one of the reasonable ones.

00:33:36.813 --> 00:33:36.933
Maybe.

00:33:36.953 --> 00:33:39.336
But yeah, how's the download folder looking nowadays?

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:42.680
Even worse.

00:33:43.361 --> 00:33:43.982
That's right.

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:45.744
What?

00:33:45.764 --> 00:33:46.485
I can't remember.

00:33:48.288 --> 00:33:52.415
Remember there's that one file that we're gonna look for but we didn't look for it.

00:33:52.435 --> 00:33:54.018
Oh no, I made a note for that.

00:33:54.038 --> 00:33:55.520
Oh, I already know where it is.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.143
It's not in the downloads folder.

00:33:57.163 --> 00:33:59.507
The one file not in the... I'm taking, loading, loading, loading.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:06.839
Downloads folder is... 40, just, just over 44,000 files.

00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:08.662
Wow, that's not bad.

00:34:08.822 --> 00:34:11.106
I think it doubled in size than last time.

00:34:12.014 --> 00:34:14.864
Yay!

00:34:14.884 --> 00:34:14.984
Over!

00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:18.236
It'll get organized in the future, right Moco-chan?

00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:20.303
No.

00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:23.420
BAU BAU!

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.865
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:34:26.885 --> 00:34:31.352
And thank you for always being a very important part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:31.512 --> 00:34:35.278
We're always waiting for more Doggy of the Days, more questions!

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.002
We want to see your walk, so please send us your walks!

00:34:38.663 --> 00:34:47.037
And if you have any Pero sightings, let us know what you've been dealing with with the hashtag!

00:34:47.057 --> 00:34:47.317
Hashtag!

00:34:47.337 --> 00:34:47.577
FWMCMORNING!

00:35:18.181 --> 00:35:19.482
Birthday girl.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.006
Bae-senpai.

00:35:23.086 --> 00:35:24.947
Yeah, Boston buddy.

00:35:25.408 --> 00:35:27.450
Hajime and Vivi!

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.171
A big ripple group.

00:35:29.832 --> 00:35:30.072
Right?

00:35:30.152 --> 00:35:32.454
It's gonna be very interesting.

00:35:32.474 --> 00:35:34.036
I know this is funny.

00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:35.597
I didn't know it would happen, huh?

00:35:36.378 --> 00:35:38.000
Let's stay alive and be helpful.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.362
Let's not drop things and break them, okay?

00:35:42.263 --> 00:35:44.125
We can leave that to somebody else like Vivi.

00:35:44.145 --> 00:35:46.467
I think Vivi's gonna do all the damage.

00:35:46.487 --> 00:35:47.108
I have a feeling it's okay.

00:35:47.577 --> 00:35:50.942
It's not gonna be us though.

00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:51.382
No!

00:35:52.444 --> 00:35:56.149
We have a cute boy too!

00:35:56.169 --> 00:35:56.590
BAU BAU!

00:35:58.232 --> 00:36:09.288
And for the Ruffians joining us in the icons today, your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU Boston people!

00:36:09.308 --> 00:36:09.889
BAU BAU!

00:36:09.869 --> 00:36:12.493
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:12.513 --> 00:36:13.234
It's been a very fun week.

00:36:13.795 --> 00:36:20.224
Thank you for joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning today too!

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:20.505

00:36:20.725 --> 00:36:26.754
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

It's time for FUWAMOCO!

00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:17.922
As every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:37:17.962 --> 00:37:20.705
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
