05:09.003 --> 05:14.287
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.307 --> 05:18.170
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.271 --> 05:18.651
BAU BAU!

05:20.001 --> 05:23.762
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.222 --> 05:26.662
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:26.822 --> 05:28.783
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:28.843 --> 05:31.443
BAU BAU BAU!

05:32.023 --> 05:36.804
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:36.884 --> 05:41.065
Thank you for joining us today, Ruffians, for our 87th episode!

05:41.085 --> 05:41.385
87th!

05:41.465 --> 05:41.705
87th!

05:41.825 --> 05:42.545
Right!

05:42.585 --> 05:42.905
BAU BAU!

05:47.586 --> 05:49.768
Moco-chan, what do you mean you lost count?

06:00.816 --> 06:04.058
Yes, good!

06:04.218 --> 06:06.479
BAU BAU!

06:06.780 --> 06:14.564
Even though it's the 87th episode, there might be some Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time!

06:14.724 --> 06:24.770
So, to explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

06:24.830 --> 06:27.432
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:28.272 --> 06:34.298
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:34.538 --> 06:41.205
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING.

06:41.665 --> 06:45.349
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:57.520 --> 06:58.621
BAU BAU!

06:58.701 --> 07:05.705
And with that, we have bad news.

07:05.905 --> 07:06.125
Huh?

07:06.606 --> 07:10.988
Is it another Pero Sighting?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.351
Why did you see him this time, Ruffians?

07:16.752 --> 07:18.173
Well, let's see.

07:19.093 --> 07:20.314
De-den!

07:22.391 --> 07:23.354
Is this Peron?

07:23.795 --> 07:28.411
I just wanted to take a nap in the street.

07:29.588 --> 07:31.509
That's kind of a crazy spot to find him in.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.970
You can't even see his face!

07:33.110 --> 07:33.371
Right!

07:33.391 --> 07:35.092
You don't expect to see Pero- Oh!

07:35.492 --> 07:35.612
Oh!

07:35.852 --> 07:38.274
That kinda looks like Pero in the middle of the street!

07:38.314 --> 07:39.135
The round... Right.

07:39.595 --> 07:41.016
The round shape though.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.297
That's definitely him.

07:42.377 --> 07:43.818
Definitely him, huh?

07:44.138 --> 07:52.384
I wonder though, do you think... Do you think maybe he got scared and decided to hide in... The worst place possible!

07:53.445 --> 07:55.086
I don't know, maybe he's stuck?

07:56.355 --> 07:59.621
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

08:07.270 --> 08:08.611
This is where he is now.

08:09.332 --> 08:14.456
Kind of like, you know, like a murder hornet that gets stuck in a sticky mouse trap.

08:14.476 --> 08:15.377
Just leave him!

08:16.037 --> 08:16.638
Dig him out!

08:16.738 --> 08:20.461
I don't know... He needs help, you think?

08:20.601 --> 08:25.305
Yeah, he looks like he fits in there, but... Ruffians, you think you should help?

08:25.325 --> 08:26.346
Speed BAU!

08:26.366 --> 08:26.746
Tickle him!

08:26.786 --> 08:27.046
Tickle him...

08:33.876 --> 08:35.237
That was so bad.

08:36.137 --> 08:37.857
No, no, don't help him.

08:38.398 --> 08:39.158
No, okay.

08:39.558 --> 08:40.558
Okay, okay.

08:40.598 --> 08:41.919
That's your answer.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.319
Pero will have to get himself out of this one.

08:44.459 --> 08:44.800
Yeah.

08:45.300 --> 08:45.940
No helping.

08:45.960 --> 08:46.920
Yeah.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.142
Although it'll be kind of interesting to poke him and see what happens, right?

08:51.162 --> 08:52.442
Do you think he'll make a sound?

08:54.770 --> 08:59.372
I'd be scared to run away if that happened.

08:59.612 --> 09:01.073
Give him a poke and then leave.

09:01.153 --> 09:01.833
BAU BAU!

09:07.485 --> 09:08.946
What did he do to you?

09:09.186 --> 09:10.627
He's nasty!

09:10.848 --> 09:12.909
Okay.

09:13.309 --> 09:15.911
He's nasty, so this is normal.

09:15.951 --> 09:17.653
This is regular.

09:19.374 --> 09:20.134
Oh, you can jump on it.

09:20.515 --> 09:21.175
That would be fun.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.957
BAU BAU!

09:24.377 --> 09:26.099
Wow, Ruffians!

09:26.719 --> 09:28.701
We're really really excited for

09:29.341 --> 09:30.822
Beginning of May.

09:30.842 --> 09:35.827
I don't know why I'm so excited, but very much for the beginning of May!

09:36.027 --> 09:36.928
Because!

09:37.208 --> 09:38.889
FUWAMOCO!

09:39.250 --> 09:42.853
We're gonna be participating in a fan meeting in Taipei!

09:42.933 --> 09:43.613
BAU BAU!

09:46.636 --> 09:52.963
We really want to be able to chat lots and lots and BAU BAU together too.

10:04.796 --> 10:08.719
Thank you so much, BAU BAU!

10:08.779 --> 10:10.240
Thank you for the moments!

10:10.400 --> 10:12.741
We're really excited!

10:13.021 --> 10:16.323
But it's not just a fan meeting though!

10:16.484 --> 10:24.389
We'll be participating in the special hololive meet Super Carol Giveaway performance on May 11th!

10:24.529 --> 10:25.789
And it's not just us!

10:25.829 --> 10:30.893
We're gonna be there along with Kobo-senpai, Bibi-senpai, Aya-senpai,

10:31.733 --> 10:35.136
We're so excited!

10:35.196 --> 10:36.758
We're gonna sing a bunch.

10:36.958 --> 10:37.779
Lots of songs.

10:38.079 --> 10:41.902
We hope that you'll be able to make it.

10:41.922 --> 10:43.283
Maybe you're in the area.

10:43.323 --> 10:43.744
Maybe?

10:46.089 --> 10:48.671
If you are, make sure you're noisy!

10:48.691 --> 10:49.691
And loud!

10:50.051 --> 10:51.092
And crazy!

10:51.232 --> 10:54.094
And BAU BAU BAU BAU!

10:54.134 --> 10:55.354
That's okay!

10:55.435 --> 10:58.716
It'd be nice if you taught us a lot about Taipei, too!

10:59.277 --> 11:01.198
We're just so excited!

11:01.298 --> 11:03.639
It's gonna be fun!

11:03.659 --> 11:04.320
BAU BAU!

11:04.440 --> 11:10.323
I really hope we can meet a lot of Ruffians there.

11:10.363 --> 11:11.824
We know it's pretty soon, huh?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.688
If you're in the area.

11:14.829 --> 11:16.533
BAU BAU!

11:20.269 --> 11:25.273
You know, there's been so many exciting things going on and not just coming up.

11:25.874 --> 11:34.701
But, while we were busy finding our new doghouse, there was some new FUWAMOCO merch that we missed!

11:34.882 --> 11:36.783
BAU BAU!

11:36.983 --> 11:45.691
Yeah, you know, well, maybe Ruffians, do you kind of ever feel a little shy of buying merch of your oshi?

11:45.731 --> 11:46.852
Because, you know,

11:47.512 --> 11:50.841
She's just so cute and maybe it's not quite your style.

11:50.861 --> 11:51.843
Yeah, I know!

11:52.619 --> 11:53.719
Ruffians are rough.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.921
You may be a little bit embarrassing sometimes.

11:57.961 --> 11:59.902
FUWAMOCO the pink and blue.

11:59.962 --> 12:03.003
Pink and blue is not, well, if that's the problem, that's not gonna help.

12:03.463 --> 12:04.283
But it's okay!

12:04.383 --> 12:07.425
It's okay!

12:07.645 --> 12:12.327
You can get FUWAMOCO merch because on hololive official shop.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.487
Now there's emblem style merch.

12:14.527 --> 12:16.568
FUWAMOCO my team!

12:16.748 --> 12:17.548
It's still blue and pink.

12:17.729 --> 12:18.749
It's still blue and pink.

12:19.149 --> 12:21.270
But you think blue and pink are embarrassing.

12:24.292 --> 12:24.812
BAU BAU!

12:24.952 --> 12:26.153
BAU BAU!

12:40.300 --> 12:50.767
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm not a chihuahua, I'm not a chihuahua, I'm not a chihuahua, I'm not a chihuahua, I'm not a chihuahua.

12:59.392 --> 13:02.014
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

13:16.063 --> 13:17.624
Please check them out, Ruffians!

13:17.644 --> 13:21.327
Especially if you want to grow your FUWAMOCO merch collection!

13:22.788 --> 13:24.029
Don't be oppressed though, okay?

13:24.049 --> 13:25.269
They're pretty cool!

13:25.369 --> 13:26.770
Design kakkoii!

13:26.810 --> 13:27.431
Kakkoii ne!

13:27.691 --> 13:30.733
Hopefully they'll arrive soon!

13:30.753 --> 13:32.154
Let us know, okay?

13:32.194 --> 13:32.955
BAU BAU!

13:33.075 --> 13:37.738
Thank you, Ruffians!

13:38.198 --> 13:40.139
Pero merch doko?

13:40.520 --> 13:41.020
Really?

13:41.180 --> 13:41.700
Really?

13:41.720 --> 13:45.163
I thought we decided we're gonna leave him in the void.

13:46.663 --> 13:49.224
Do you really want merch of a speed bump?

13:49.544 --> 13:50.364
Yeah.

13:51.225 --> 13:51.825
Oh no.

13:52.245 --> 13:52.745
Why?

13:52.805 --> 13:54.405
My oshi's a speed bump.

13:56.846 --> 13:57.426
Hi!

13:57.506 --> 13:58.287
Wow.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.627
Hair merch, really?

14:01.427 --> 14:03.428
Okay, Ruffians, that's interesting.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.068
BAU BAU!

14:05.168 --> 14:07.169
BAU BAU!

14:08.309 --> 14:14.131
Oh, well, Ruffians, you know, now FUWAMOCO Morning is back and everything.

14:14.751 --> 14:23.138
But maybe, you know, during your busy day, suddenly you're like, I don't know, something's missing.

14:23.538 --> 14:29.522
And you just get the sudden urge to hear a good BAU BAU!

14:30.083 --> 14:30.583
Maybe?

14:30.643 --> 14:32.264
Maybe not?

14:33.005 --> 14:33.525
Maybe not?

14:35.887 --> 14:36.688
Yeah!

14:38.786 --> 14:38.846
Wow!

14:39.287 --> 14:48.355
Now you can hear a good BAU BAU whenever you need to if you head over to FWMCBAUBAU.com!

14:48.736 --> 14:49.256
Yeah!

14:50.117 --> 14:59.806
There's the global BAU BAU counter and if you click on it on FUWAMOCO there, you can hear many different BAU BIAs from us!

15:00.107 --> 15:00.707
BAU BAU!

15:00.968 --> 15:01.728
Have you tried it?

15:01.828 --> 15:01.888
BAU!

15:02.469 --> 15:04.851
You can get a little addicting sometimes, huh?

15:05.111 --> 15:06.392
Yeah.

15:06.832 --> 15:12.557
You know, this means that wherever you are, you can get some more BAU BAU powers!

15:12.577 --> 15:14.278
Get to use their day, you know.

15:14.298 --> 15:16.320
Or even on the phone, too!

15:16.400 --> 15:18.742
Or maybe they helped you out a month ago!

15:18.862 --> 15:25.146
When you're sleepy and your brain is moving a lot, then you can just go BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

15:25.166 --> 15:27.408
And then you'll get a bit sleepier.

15:28.129 --> 15:29.810
I hope you'll get sleepier excited.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.191
It's a little very addicting.

15:31.251 --> 15:31.511
Yeah.

15:32.472 --> 15:35.453
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

15:35.513 --> 15:35.873
BAU BAU!

15:52.919 --> 15:53.999
Please go check it out.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.781
Get some BAU BAU power!

15:58.661 --> 15:59.962
It's just so much fun.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.143
And the biggest thank you!

16:02.323 --> 16:07.885
Thank you so much to Artful Peace for all the love and creativity to make this a fun website.

16:08.145 --> 16:09.025
Amazing!

16:09.505 --> 16:13.947
Thank you from the globe for BAUFUN!

16:13.987 --> 16:15.188
BAU BAU!

16:16.508 --> 16:18.670
That is... 2 million!

16:19.030 --> 16:23.093
Ruffians, have you been BAU BAUing at the BAU counter?

16:23.113 --> 16:29.719
BAU BAUing at the BAU... I wonder how many BAU BAUs are your BAU BAUs.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.221
I wonder how many are ours.

16:32.537 --> 16:37.320
Please check it on FWMCMORNING.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.503
Actually, sometimes it's sort of fun.

16:41.563 --> 16:48.747
Because I'll press the BAU BAU counter and then I'll see that it went up again without me.

16:48.767 --> 16:54.751
So I'm BAU BAUing at the same time and Ruffian is also BAU BAUing.

16:55.231 --> 16:58.235
Sorry for the fun.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.577
BAU BAU!

17:00.597 --> 17:02.720
You BAU BAUing right now!

17:02.760 --> 17:03.440
BAU BAUing!

17:03.701 --> 17:04.341
BAU BAUing!

17:04.662 --> 17:08.746
Oh, Moco-chan, should we make a special BAU BAU for the BAU counter?

17:09.467 --> 17:09.968
Right now!

17:09.988 --> 17:11.750
BAU BAUing!

17:12.611 --> 17:13.292
BAU BAU!

17:15.836 --> 17:17.877
I wanted to stand out, you know.

17:17.897 --> 17:19.078
BAU BAU!

17:19.499 --> 17:21.940
BAU BAU!

17:21.960 --> 17:24.062
BAU BAU!

17:24.122 --> 17:24.962
Thank you!

17:25.042 --> 17:28.324
Thank you!

17:28.344 --> 17:30.886
Ruffians!

17:33.568 --> 17:36.210
You know, you might have heard...

17:37.145 --> 17:44.170
During my super chat reading the other day, I might have mentioned something.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.292
I know.

17:47.552 --> 17:53.357
That maybe my chance to get a sign that says, don't feed the dogs.

17:54.257 --> 17:57.500
I know so I don't get as many tweets from the staff.

18:02.334 --> 18:06.896
You know, everyone knows that we love Pondering Donuts.

18:07.557 --> 18:12.619
And so, they kind of keep on appearing whenever we go to the studio, right?

18:12.639 --> 18:23.365
When we met Mine-chan the other day, she had a gift for us!

18:23.605 --> 18:25.626
It wasn't Pondering, but it was something...

18:26.403 --> 18:27.504
Really delicious.

18:28.504 --> 18:31.806
A bunch of coupons for Taiyaki!

18:32.127 --> 18:35.689
To be exact, ten coupons for Taiyaki!

18:35.989 --> 18:37.070
Taiyaki!

18:37.610 --> 18:38.651
We love Taiyaki!

18:38.671 --> 18:39.491
Ten coupons.

18:39.971 --> 18:40.271
Ten.

18:47.329 --> 18:51.052
Yeah, you know, we can't turn down a gift from Mari-chan.

18:51.333 --> 18:59.340
You know, wouldn't you be sad if you tried to give someone a gift, and then they said they couldn't eat it, and then gave it away and tossed it out?

18:59.440 --> 18:59.760
Right.

19:00.341 --> 19:00.781
Right.

19:01.402 --> 19:07.087
You need to accept it to spe- Accept the feelings, you know?

19:07.167 --> 19:07.668
Yeah.

19:07.868 --> 19:09.249
You can't just toss it out.

19:09.609 --> 19:09.850
No.

19:11.906 --> 19:12.566
Ten-yaki?

19:12.606 --> 19:13.967
Ten-taiyaki?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.288
Ten-taiyaki.

19:16.308 --> 19:19.950
Thank you, Mori-chan!

19:20.210 --> 19:21.771
BAU BAU!

19:21.851 --> 19:24.713
Ruffians, what flavors should we get?

19:24.773 --> 19:31.476
There's the traditional rabbit, but there's also other flavors like custard, sweet potato.

19:31.496 --> 19:33.617
Sometimes there's matcha.

19:36.116 --> 19:41.982
Not so good!

19:42.222 --> 19:43.443
Custard.

19:43.543 --> 19:46.046
Red bean.

19:46.866 --> 19:49.349
Chocolate.

19:49.729 --> 19:50.770
Sweet potato.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.492
Custard.

19:53.252 --> 19:55.254
I don't think I've ever had a custard one.

19:55.334 --> 19:58.457
We have ten taiyaki, we could get a bunch of different flavors.

19:59.738 --> 20:01.600
I feel like we should share them.

20:02.861 --> 20:04.121
Apple mango!

20:04.802 --> 20:07.083
I've never seen that before.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.424
Root beer flavor.

20:08.444 --> 20:09.565
I would.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.927
I don't think they have root beer flavor.

20:12.487 --> 20:12.867
I would.

20:12.927 --> 20:15.229
Maybe they have Salonpas flavor.

20:16.570 --> 20:20.793
Salonpas flavor taiyaki!

20:20.993 --> 20:24.775
Salonpas taiyaki!

20:24.896 --> 20:25.956
No.

20:26.276 --> 20:27.537
Maybe we'll take our time.

20:28.738 --> 20:31.299
Maybe one taiyaki here.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.721
Another taiyaki here.

20:34.081 --> 20:36.842
Maybe we should get that sign from Mane-chan no ha.

20:37.543 --> 20:39.424
Maybe.

20:40.444 --> 20:42.085
Thank you guys!

20:43.226 --> 20:44.647
BAU BAU!

20:45.047 --> 20:45.647
Wow!

20:45.927 --> 20:46.828
Ruffians!

20:47.228 --> 20:49.209
It's another FUWAMOCO Morning!

20:49.429 --> 20:53.211
That means there's another Doggie of the Day today!

20:53.591 --> 20:55.052
Who's today's Doggie of the Day?

20:55.132 --> 20:57.834
Today's Doggie of the Day is... The Dog!

20:58.734 --> 21:04.860
It's Freya and Rooney!

21:05.521 --> 21:10.466
I'm going to guess that maybe Freya is the one with the black fur there and the beautiful eyes.

21:10.506 --> 21:12.187
Look at the brown eyes there.

21:12.668 --> 21:15.010
I'm sure there's a second one.

21:15.550 --> 21:18.233
And Rooney is the one there with the very like

21:20.658 --> 21:23.503
What kind of look would you take this in the eye?

21:23.583 --> 21:23.924
Sleepy.

21:23.944 --> 21:24.305
Sleepy?

21:24.685 --> 21:26.629
I'm thinking furious.

21:26.989 --> 21:27.711
Seductive.

21:29.902 --> 21:30.522
BAU BAU!

21:58.314 --> 21:59.595
Like that.

21:59.635 --> 22:00.255
Like that?

22:01.416 --> 22:02.957
BAU BAU.

22:03.257 --> 22:04.178
BAU BAU BAU.

22:04.358 --> 22:04.618

22:04.798 --> 22:05.779
What about Rooney?

22:05.799 --> 22:07.540
BAU BAU.

22:08.180 --> 22:08.861
BAU BAU.

22:08.881 --> 22:12.563
I feel like Rooney might have a very deep voice.

22:12.903 --> 22:13.724
BAU BAU.

22:15.325 --> 22:16.065
BAU BAU.

22:17.726 --> 22:23.450
But you know, you're so lucky to have Rooney in your life.

22:23.870 --> 22:25.391
Two wonderful pups!

22:27.492 --> 22:28.073
Ruffians!

22:28.133 --> 22:33.745
There's also another two wonderful puppies here too, huh?

22:34.266 --> 22:36.811
Yeah, but three of them, huh?

22:38.855 --> 22:39.576
Hi!

22:39.876 --> 22:40.556
That's fun.

22:41.297 --> 22:47.640
We hope you enjoy the birthday merch, and please make sure that they don't chew on the Ruffian plushies too much.

22:48.161 --> 22:49.742
I think you're into Vtubers.

22:50.162 --> 22:50.582
Yeah.

22:50.722 --> 22:52.623
BAU BAU!

22:52.703 --> 22:54.765
Thank you!

22:54.985 --> 22:58.487
And for our next corner, I'll get the title, right?

22:58.867 --> 23:05.471
Today, I went for... Today I went on a walk, I even brought it all for you guys!

23:08.664 --> 23:10.827
Where did we go on a walk today, huh?

23:11.607 --> 23:12.028
BAU!

23:12.208 --> 23:12.749
Why?

23:12.929 --> 23:14.570
Why?

23:14.991 --> 23:16.032
Maofuji!

23:16.112 --> 23:18.314
Maofuji with G-san!

23:18.395 --> 23:19.055
G-san!

23:19.496 --> 23:21.638
Oh my gosh.

23:21.698 --> 23:23.360
Where did you do it?

23:23.420 --> 23:24.721
So beautiful.

23:24.741 --> 23:26.763
We love Maofuji!

23:27.364 --> 23:29.686
Look, it's so amazing, right?

23:30.959 --> 23:32.120
Whenever we see Mt.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.543
Fuji, no, our breath kinda gets a bit taken away.

23:35.563 --> 23:39.406
I don't know, something about it is just very hot.

23:39.426 --> 23:40.267
That's a mountain.

23:40.828 --> 23:43.050
That's a mountain, Mt.

23:43.070 --> 23:44.191
Fuji!

23:44.291 --> 23:49.395
Thank you for going on such a beautiful walk and taking us with you too!

23:50.136 --> 23:52.498
I don't know, I think it'd be really fun to climb Mt.

23:52.558 --> 23:53.539
Fuji one day.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.000
It's not easy though.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.441
No, and it's busy hot.

23:56.841 --> 23:58.042
I think so, yeah.

23:59.456 --> 24:00.277
It'll be fun, no?

24:00.377 --> 24:00.717
Yeah!

24:00.737 --> 24:02.018
We'll have to try it!

24:02.038 --> 24:02.298
BAU BAU!

24:03.018 --> 24:04.339
BAU BAU!

24:04.359 --> 24:05.760
Thank you!

24:06.440 --> 24:10.302
And next, we have our Question of the Day!

24:10.382 --> 24:14.424
My Question of the Day is... De-den!

24:14.804 --> 24:21.408
I'm curious about ponderings, but nowhere near me sells them, so I'm going to try to make my own.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.190
Do you have any favorite flavors or toppings to recommend?

24:27.771 --> 24:30.155
First, good luck making your own!

24:30.495 --> 24:35.583
Please be really careful with, you know, all the hot oil.

24:35.743 --> 24:39.089
And also, go in expecting it not to work out.

24:39.389 --> 24:42.273
They're very hard to make.

24:43.195 --> 24:47.160
You know, even us, we've failed many, many, many times!

24:47.180 --> 24:51.666
So number one thing is just have fun, okay?

24:52.246 --> 24:58.214
But our favorite flavor is just a simple sweet glaze.

24:58.815 --> 25:00.036
Nothing, no flavor really.

25:00.857 --> 25:02.399
It's a flavor.

25:02.699 --> 25:04.621
It's sweet.

25:05.001 --> 25:06.262
It's a sweet flavor.

25:06.322 --> 25:07.664
I don't know.

25:07.704 --> 25:09.025
It's not too thick.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.627
It's just perfectly sweet.

25:10.667 --> 25:10.987
Right.

25:11.167 --> 25:14.410
You know, and they have matcha and strawberry flavors too.

25:14.470 --> 25:15.091
They're nice.

25:15.131 --> 25:15.832
Nice, good.

25:16.272 --> 25:20.176
I think just a simple powdering is the most yummy to us.

25:20.196 --> 25:20.736
Classic.

25:20.896 --> 25:21.397
Yeah.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.579
Especially with a cup of hot milk tea too.

25:23.639 --> 25:24.079
Yeah.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.400
It's perfect.

25:25.440 --> 25:25.941
Yeah.

25:26.381 --> 25:28.263
I don't know, it's not really vanilla.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.165
It's just sweet.

25:30.325 --> 25:30.705
Sweet.

25:30.725 --> 25:31.025
Sweet.

25:31.866 --> 25:32.266
Sweet.

25:32.507 --> 25:33.448
Yeah.

25:33.488 --> 25:33.808
Normal.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.588
BAU BAU!

25:39.689 --> 25:40.209
Good luck!

25:40.429 --> 25:42.670
Maybe I would suggest matcha though.

25:43.071 --> 25:46.333
Especially knowing the kind of pondering FUWAMOCO make.

25:51.051 --> 25:53.133
So you might wanna glaze just in case.

25:53.554 --> 25:53.774
Yeah.

25:53.854 --> 25:54.535
It's not the best.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.896
Just like FUWAMOCO.

25:56.116 --> 25:57.178
BAU BAU!

25:58.599 --> 26:00.321
BAU BAU!

26:01.502 --> 26:02.102
Thank you!

26:02.443 --> 26:03.404
Thank you!

26:03.464 --> 26:04.985
What do you think is gonna happen next round?

26:05.306 --> 26:06.187
Next stream!

26:09.008 --> 26:14.931
I wanna say a big thank you to all the Ruffians for your submissions today for this week.

26:15.411 --> 26:19.152
Because FUWAMOCO Morning, you know, it's a show we make together.

26:20.013 --> 26:25.695
So please continue sending us your submissions with the hashtag.

26:26.055 --> 26:28.136
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

26:28.196 --> 26:31.618
You're gonna go on a walk today, right?

26:32.598 --> 26:33.498
Let's take a photo!

26:33.538 --> 26:34.558
Let us see where you went!

26:34.938 --> 26:35.319
Okay!

26:35.659 --> 26:38.119
Or maybe... I know it's scary, okay?

26:38.139 --> 26:40.039
Maybe you're gonna have salad for lunch.

26:40.459 --> 26:44.480
And you're like, ooh, I wonder what FUWAMOCO likes to put in their salad.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.680
What kind of salad dressing.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.361
Do they eat salad?

26:48.721 --> 26:50.741
Let us know with the hashtag.

26:51.321 --> 26:53.802
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

26:54.002 --> 26:54.682
Okay!

26:56.442 --> 26:58.182
BAU BAU!

26:58.843 --> 26:59.843
And next!

27:00.223 --> 27:01.283
For our next stream,

27:02.073 --> 27:02.653
Wow!

27:02.733 --> 27:06.974
Originally we were going to be having a stream tonight with Ollie-senpai.

27:06.994 --> 27:10.635
We were going to be playing her new visual novel, Days with Ollie.

27:10.655 --> 27:14.477
But unfortunately it's release has been postponed a little bit.

27:14.877 --> 27:18.318
So the stream will be postponed for now too.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.619
It's too bad, but it'll be releasing very soon on the 22nd.

27:23.699 --> 27:24.800
It's not too far off.

27:26.460 --> 27:30.441
So please check it out on Steam once it releases, okay?

27:30.561 --> 27:37.163
So our next stream now is... FUWAMOCO Rock n' Roll Party!

27:37.323 --> 27:39.524
This time we're singing anime songs.

27:39.944 --> 27:42.045
Usually we sing a lot of anime songs.

27:42.265 --> 27:44.566
This time we will sing a lot of anime songs.

27:44.686 --> 27:48.347
I don't know if it's gonna be... Is it gonna be 100% anime songs?

27:48.827 --> 27:49.387
I don't know yet.

27:49.607 --> 27:51.668
I was thinking I want to sing that song.

27:52.248 --> 27:55.309
And that was kind of a... Mostly anime song.

27:57.031 --> 28:00.118
If you like anime songs, you'll like it.

28:01.060 --> 28:02.123
And we can be loud!

28:02.143 --> 28:03.366
And we can have fun!

28:03.746 --> 28:06.352
We haven't heard anything since Donkey Kong, so...

28:07.658 --> 28:08.819
I think we're good.

28:08.839 --> 28:09.779
We might be in the clear.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.881
Please join us on FUWAMOCO!

28:12.961 --> 28:20.606
And like always, it will be archived, so maybe if you're a little busy, you can check it out later, but we hope you'll be there too!

28:21.126 --> 28:23.048
BAU BAU!

28:23.728 --> 28:32.353
And if we take a peek at our schedule, on Sunday at our doggy pack, we're gonna be having a battle plan stream.

You know, it's been 8 months since we debuted.

Strategy.

28:55.885 --> 29:07.754
You know, so we hope you'll be there and be a part of it and let us know if you have good ideas or maybe FUWAMOCO you could try this or you said you wanted to do this but you haven't yet.

29:08.174 --> 29:13.238
You know, let's have a bunch of fun and chat about all those kind of things.

29:14.839 --> 29:18.802
