# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Before submitting a pull request, please **read the following guidelines**.

## General

- Make sure that your contribution follows the [hololive production Derivative Works Guidelines](https://hololivepro.com/en/terms/). In short, ensure that it cannot be misinterpreted as officially endorsed by any hololive talent or Cover Corp., and that it doesn't damage a third party's image.
- Use proper capitalization for proper nouns. Use the [hololive Talent page](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/talents/) as reference for talent and generation names.
- Separate Japanese honorifics with a hyphen (e.g., Tanigo-san, Moco-chan).
- Unless relevant to the context of the content, do not introduce intentional misspellings. For example, do not spell 'Ruffians' as 'Wuffians'.

## Summaries for FWMC Morning

- Keep it short; aim for 2-3 sentences per segment. If one segment is too long, consider dividing it into more sections.
- Take additional considerations for the following segments:
    - Introduction: The episode number should be included.
    - Doggie of the Day: Make sure to include the name of the pet showcased.
    - Question of the Day: Summary should focus on the answer to the question asked.
    - Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians: Avoid mentioning the names of any specific Ruffian that was called out.
- If possible, run the linter script first.

There might be some summaries that don't comply with these guidelines, as they were made before a specific style was set in place. Feel free to point them out or, even better, to submit a fix.

## Subtitles

Until a standard format has been set, only typo corrections and meaningful timestamp fixes will be accepted.

## Others

If you're planning to submit other types of contribution, please ask first by opening an issue.
