## Introduction (04:39)

FUWAMOCO cheerfully greet the Ruffians in the first official episode of *FUWAMOCO Morning*, aiming to bring smiles and start the day right.

## 700K Views on "Kaibutsu" (05:59)

FUWAMOCO celebrate reaching 700,000 views on their [cover of YOASOBI's "Kaibutsu,"](https://youtu.be/Yr1EI_jYBB8) expressing gratitude for the Ruffians' support early on. They jokingly question fans for mistaking them with Marine-senpai, then ask them about their favorite parts of the song.

## Misunderstanding (08:40)

Mococo apologizes for not knowing about [Ina's "TOMORROW!"](https://youtu.be/sMcfFmR0MmA) meme despite their high grades in the Official hololive Knowledge Test. They also clarify a misunderstanding about the Takenoko vs Kinoko debate. They prefer neither the chocolate versions but enjoy real bamboo shoots and mushrooms.

## Advent First Thoughts (13:33)

FUWAMOCO share first impressions of their fellow *Advent* members. They describe Shiori as initially intimidating but sweet, Biboo as shy yet strong, and Nerissa as affectionate and bold.

## Doggie of the Day (23:44)

The first "Doggie of the Day" is a strong, royal-looking hellhound with a nose that resembles a PlayStation controller. Whether this pupper is fuzzy or fluffy, that's up to you!

## Today I Went On A Walk (25:53)

FUWAMOCO review a [peaceful walk](https://twitter.com/GenjiPriv/status/1686548641992015874) with fluffy clouds, blue skies, and lush trees. They remind Ruffians to stay hydrated and wear sunscreen!

## Question Of The Day (27:09)

[Asked about Japan](https://twitter.com/tatantannotan/status/1686547887084486658), FUWAMOCO express interest in trying [wanko soba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanko_soba), a fast-paced soba-eating challenge. They admit they haven't tried that yet, probably because of the idea of getting nervous as they are being watched while eating.

## Next Stream & Schedule (29:40)

FUWAMOCO announce they'll be playing [Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion](https://youtu.be/kRHAfh9z3cc) later in the day. They also remind Ruffians about their Saturday ["Rock n' Rawr Party" karaoke stream](https://youtu.be/O_gFJJ2ToLg).

## Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians (33:41)

FUWAMOCO shout out some Ruffians and wish everyone a great day before ending the show with their signature *BAU BAU*!
