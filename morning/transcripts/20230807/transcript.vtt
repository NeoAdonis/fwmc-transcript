05:02.550 --> 05:05.160
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:05.160 --> 05:10.305
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:10.325 --> 05:18.815
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:19.275 --> 05:21.418
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:21.598 --> 05:23.280
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:26.161 --> 05:29.963
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:30.463 --> 05:33.265
Thank you so much for joining us for today.

05:33.285 --> 05:36.186
It's our third episode!

05:36.286 --> 05:38.547
Are you surprised?

05:40.228 --> 05:41.369
It's the third episode.

05:41.449 --> 05:41.989
I don't know.

05:42.789 --> 05:45.871
I'm just happy with every new FUWAMOCO Morning you know.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.112
Ruffians, did you think we could do it?

05:52.947 --> 05:56.149
Well... Moco-chan, what is FUWAMOCO Morning?

05:56.389 --> 05:57.609
Ah, FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:57.629 --> 06:04.592
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:04.792 --> 06:05.652
A.K.A.

06:05.752 --> 06:06.632
FUWAMOCO.

06:06.892 --> 06:07.673
And hosted by us!

06:08.956 --> 06:09.496
What's your name?

06:09.976 --> 06:11.337
FUWAMOCO!

06:11.397 --> 06:19.340
Our aim is to bring you a smile and start your day off on the right paw.

06:19.660 --> 06:24.382
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:24.442 --> 06:25.762
Right above me!

06:26.903 --> 06:31.264
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:31.344 --> 06:34.926
BAU BAU!

06:35.006 --> 06:36.446
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:36.506 --> 06:37.347
BAU BAU BAU!

06:42.796 --> 06:48.762
It was a bit hard because we didn't want to say too much yesterday, but it's hard not to.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.444
Actually... De-den!

06:55.774 --> 06:59.298
We reached 1 million views on our cover archive too!

06:59.378 --> 07:00.300
Thank you!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.342
Another amazing milestone.

07:02.362 --> 07:04.044
We reached all together.

07:04.064 --> 07:05.726
Thank you Ruffians.

07:05.806 --> 07:06.427
Thank you.

07:06.447 --> 07:09.551
BAU BAU BAU!

07:09.891 --> 07:12.574
We're really blown away by all your enthusiasm.

07:12.875 --> 07:13.375
Thank you.

07:14.616 --> 07:20.598
I think we talked about it a lot, but we are really, really excited to be able to share Kaibutsu with you.

07:21.078 --> 07:26.679
And actually, when we were really, really nervous for our debut, kind of waiting.

07:28.460 --> 07:34.481
Whenever we watch Kaibutsu over, we think about what your reaction would be like.

07:34.902 --> 07:39.363
That gave us the courage to kind of get through our little jitters here and there, right?

07:40.948 --> 07:48.256
Again, we'd like to say a big thanks to Omeka-san for the amazing videos.

07:48.296 --> 07:49.838
Hi-san Fred the Killer!

07:49.938 --> 07:51.619
It's really killer, right?

07:51.639 --> 07:52.340
I really like it.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.662
It's cute and cool.

07:53.882 --> 07:54.703
Right?

07:55.784 --> 07:56.465
I can be cool.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.348
I can be cool sometimes too.

08:02.076 --> 08:05.298
And also to Hamahiro-san for the magical vocal mixing.

08:05.358 --> 08:06.258
It's so amazing.

08:06.959 --> 08:10.621
You know, actually we let Mamban Puppy listen to it.

08:11.381 --> 08:16.744
And now she's been hounding us because she really wants to listen to it off of YouTube.

08:16.784 --> 08:18.245
Since she doesn't really use it that much.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.506
We're really happy that she's enjoying it too, you know?

08:21.867 --> 08:24.668
Not just the Ruffians, but also Mama Puppy.

08:24.728 --> 08:25.789
I just keep on doing it.

08:26.109 --> 08:31.412
No, YouTube has a place for Mama Puppy, so... You'll have to listen there.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.335
Is it okay to say?

08:35.675 --> 08:36.035
Is it?

08:38.316 --> 08:38.597
Maybe.

08:39.057 --> 08:39.717
Maybe?

08:40.498 --> 08:45.621
Actually, Ruffians, because of all your support, we have good news!

08:47.284 --> 08:51.346
We started working on our next cover song!

08:51.466 --> 08:52.427
BAU BAU BAU!

08:52.507 --> 08:54.127
BAU BAU!

08:54.828 --> 09:01.771
We hope you look forward to it, but please, if you like Kaibutsu, we'd really like it if you could listen to it lots and lots.

09:01.891 --> 09:02.472
Yeah, yeah.

09:02.712 --> 09:03.872
Continually, okay?

09:04.212 --> 09:06.994
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

09:07.014 --> 09:07.914
Thank you!

09:08.054 --> 09:10.435
One million!

09:10.676 --> 09:11.436
One million, one.

09:12.016 --> 09:12.156
Next!

09:12.277 --> 09:12.557
We have...

09:30.143 --> 09:31.063
De-den!

09:31.203 --> 09:36.804
We talked about this last time, but we want you to know something.

09:36.824 --> 09:41.625
We're really, really thankful that you've taken so many listens to our feed.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.466
We've seen a lot of your thoughts being shared on Twitter.

09:44.506 --> 09:48.787
We're really, really happy to be able to hear your thoughts.

09:49.407 --> 09:50.007
What you liked.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.267
Those kind of things.

09:51.827 --> 09:54.188
We had a lot of fun with it.

09:54.288 --> 09:56.188
It was a new experience for us.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.149
I think doing more voice packs is something we'd really

09:59.649 --> 09:59.949
Ruffians!

10:21.514 --> 10:25.477
What was your favorite?

10:25.777 --> 10:30.541
Like we said, there's the morning voice, and the goodnight voice, unique voice.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.103
And just because we're twins, it doesn't mean it's the same.

10:33.143 --> 10:34.384
I think they're very different.

10:34.404 --> 10:35.285
They're very different.

10:36.225 --> 10:37.767
Morning voice!

10:38.227 --> 10:39.548
Mococo morning one!

10:41.069 --> 10:42.790
It definitely has flavor, right?

10:42.870 --> 10:44.652
Flavor, right.

10:44.732 --> 10:45.653
Very flavorful.

10:46.133 --> 10:46.653
Morning voice!

10:50.316 --> 10:58.578
But we really, really want to be able to do a lot more and be able to get more opportunities to record more voicebacks in the future.

10:58.698 --> 11:04.940
I'm not sure if we mentioned it before, but we really, really enjoyed recording them to a surprising level.

11:05.340 --> 11:09.081
When we were done, we were like, that was really, really fun.

11:09.181 --> 11:11.541
I actually really, really, really enjoyed that.

11:11.801 --> 11:12.742
I want to do that more.

11:14.722 --> 11:24.031
I was thinking though, like, if we were to produce, like, our own custom hololive voice talent, make a sample and record it too, what would we want to do?

11:25.212 --> 11:26.513
Ruffians, what would you like?

11:27.274 --> 11:28.054
Yeah, good idea!

11:28.074 --> 11:29.095
A maid cafe!

11:29.416 --> 11:31.097
Maybe that's kind of plain.

11:37.147 --> 11:39.490
I could do like a Isekai voice.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.492
Oh, you're awake now.

11:41.532 --> 11:43.173
You've been sleeping for five centuries.

11:43.253 --> 11:44.634
You hit your head really hard.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.677
And now you're in a very plain world.

11:48.898 --> 11:49.719
A plain world?

11:49.739 --> 11:52.101
I was going to say, we have to go slay the dragon.

11:52.302 --> 11:53.303
You know, that kind of thing.

11:55.077 --> 11:57.838
No?

11:58.258 --> 12:05.000
Well... What about like a voice pack that's just filled with a hundred different variations of BAU?

12:05.060 --> 12:08.001
You know, like... Okay, Moco-chan.

12:08.061 --> 12:08.561
My request.

12:09.822 --> 12:14.563
Say... You're waking up your older brother, but it's BAU.

12:16.184 --> 12:17.084
BAU BAU!

12:17.104 --> 12:18.465
BAU BAU!

12:18.485 --> 12:20.685
Okay, what about for me?

12:24.403 --> 12:25.523
I made you some food.

12:25.844 --> 12:26.984
Would you like some BAU BAU?

12:28.024 --> 12:29.605
Is BAU BAU in it already?

12:29.625 --> 12:32.086
No, it's BAU BAU.

12:33.026 --> 12:34.006
I made you some food.

12:34.026 --> 12:34.286
BAU BAU.

12:34.306 --> 12:34.446
Yeah.

12:34.466 --> 12:34.647
BAU!

12:34.667 --> 12:35.227
B-B-B-BAU!

12:40.898 --> 12:42.320
Yeah, like that.

12:43.501 --> 12:43.921
Right!

12:44.462 --> 12:46.424
Would you like a voice pack like that?

12:46.824 --> 12:47.205
Good manners.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.649
You buy it, it'll be considered.

12:52.029 --> 12:54.512
Please support us with the voice packs too, okay?

12:54.912 --> 12:58.196
So we can make more and more and have more opportunities for that.

12:58.296 --> 12:58.676
Thank you!

13:01.676 --> 13:08.558
Well, there's been another misunderstanding.

13:09.338 --> 13:09.678
Why?

13:10.478 --> 13:11.919
You think we'd be better than that?

13:12.399 --> 13:15.820
You know, too many misunderstandings.

13:16.260 --> 13:16.820
It happened.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.241
It happened again.

13:18.261 --> 13:26.883
Well, this time, it happened during a stream of Little Witch Nobita.

13:28.362 --> 13:31.790
Moco-chan and Navi, we share your thoughts when it comes to squeamism.

13:36.112 --> 13:37.432
There's a misunderstanding, okay?

13:37.452 --> 13:38.672
There's a misunderstanding.

13:38.692 --> 13:53.315
You know, I said that the best combo is Tsukumizu plus Scarf, but what I really meant to say was that Tsukumizu plus Scarf plus Glasses is the best.

13:53.515 --> 13:54.075
Yeah.

13:54.775 --> 13:55.235
Right!

13:57.136 --> 13:58.856
But why are the glasses so important, Moco-chan?

13:58.896 --> 13:59.436
Because!

14:00.856 --> 14:01.637
It makes it better.

14:01.857 --> 14:02.637
It makes it better?

14:04.988 --> 14:05.428
BAU.

14:05.568 --> 14:05.828
What?

14:06.088 --> 14:07.029
Why are you laughing?

14:07.049 --> 14:08.130
This is very important.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.211
You agree, right?

14:09.911 --> 14:12.493
You need to make sure you don't misunderstand, okay?

14:13.554 --> 14:18.017
But for the record, I, Fuwawa, would also like to clarify.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.860
I said that Sukumizu and socks is the best.

14:22.640 --> 14:30.305
But what I really meant was that Tsukumizu by Socks with a banded over top is the best.

14:30.926 --> 14:31.166
Right.

14:31.946 --> 14:32.227
Right.

14:33.488 --> 14:37.170
Even better, you know, if there's a green bangle that goes around the wrist.

14:38.071 --> 14:38.831
Green bangle.

14:38.851 --> 14:40.212
A bit translucent.

14:40.232 --> 14:44.395
You might think this is ultra specific, but this is how it should be.

14:44.435 --> 14:45.356
This is the proper way.

14:46.336 --> 14:48.178
You'll understand in time, I think.

14:48.258 --> 14:48.978
You get it, right.

14:49.438 --> 14:49.879
Understand!

14:52.413 --> 14:53.454
Understood.

14:53.554 --> 14:55.415
Okay, good.

14:55.435 --> 14:57.116
No misunderstanding anymore, right?

14:58.337 --> 15:02.640
Unfortunately... We have another misunderstanding.

15:03.601 --> 15:03.921
Yeah.

15:04.842 --> 15:09.625
And this one... It's a big... A big misunderstanding.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.947
Big misunderstanding.

15:12.467 --> 15:16.030
No, uh... One that we haven't really been able to talk about yet.

15:16.150 --> 15:16.450
No.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.672
No, because it's just that big.

15:19.232 --> 15:20.233
Yeah.

15:21.534 --> 15:21.834
De-den.

15:24.721 --> 15:39.166
During the end of our Rock n' Rawr Party, you know, when there was around 30,000 viewers watching, I might have made a statement about... You have to say it!

15:39.186 --> 15:39.666
You have to!

15:39.686 --> 15:40.586
Moco-chan, you say it!

15:40.606 --> 15:41.026
You have to!

15:41.486 --> 15:41.906
A tone.

15:41.946 --> 15:43.227
A tone!

15:43.667 --> 15:45.327
A tone for it.

15:45.848 --> 15:52.010
I might have said something like, we're gonna put the dog into the monkey and make him Donkey Kong.

15:56.359 --> 15:58.482
But there's a good reason why I said this!

15:59.183 --> 16:01.227
Moco-chan, you explain.

16:03.103 --> 16:10.385
Well, Fuwawa says that she meant it like you put the play in the PlayStation, right?

16:10.706 --> 16:15.627
The X in the Xbox, or the pawn in the ring sort of thing, right?

16:15.847 --> 16:17.468
Yeah, those kind of things.

16:18.088 --> 16:19.188
You know, that's why I said it.

16:19.228 --> 16:27.651
That's why I said we're gonna put the dog in the monkey and play Donkey Kong.

16:27.771 --> 16:28.832
It makes sense, right?

16:29.132 --> 16:29.832
Right, Ruffians?

16:29.912 --> 16:31.052
It makes sense, right?

16:31.813 --> 16:32.133
Right.

16:33.154 --> 16:35.015
What I said was completely sensical.

16:35.716 --> 16:36.536
It makes sense!

16:37.277 --> 16:38.137
You agree, right?

16:38.238 --> 16:38.558
Right?

16:38.778 --> 16:40.159
I'm not seeing any question marks.

16:40.219 --> 16:40.399
Nope.

16:40.759 --> 16:44.802
Nope.

16:44.822 --> 16:46.863
There is no reason for laughter.

16:47.224 --> 16:47.404
No.

16:47.904 --> 16:48.425
It makes sense.

16:53.488 --> 16:54.189
I can get it now.

16:56.397 --> 16:56.977
Yes, you're right!

16:57.418 --> 16:58.298
Thank you!

16:58.659 --> 17:01.380
Thank you!

17:01.460 --> 17:07.685
Unfortunately, I think these sort of misunderstanding statements are a normal thing for huawuas.

17:09.766 --> 17:15.050
I guess you can probably look forward to more of those misunderstandings!

17:15.250 --> 17:19.413
I hope it doesn't happen, but... It might happen.

17:20.458 --> 17:23.660
Will there ever be a FUWAMOCO Morning without misunderstandings, though?

17:23.840 --> 17:24.420
I hope so!

17:24.520 --> 17:25.581
I hope so, too!

17:26.141 --> 17:27.782
Let's hope for that, okay, Ruffians?

17:28.222 --> 17:29.863
No more misunderstandings.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.705
Just a normal, normal FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

17:33.645 --> 17:37.247
You know, a good day with no misunderstandings to start it off with.

17:37.447 --> 17:37.688
Yeah.

17:38.248 --> 17:39.308
No dogs and monkeys.

17:39.529 --> 17:40.929
No dogs, no dogs and no monkeys.

17:41.410 --> 17:41.530
No.

17:44.321 --> 17:44.641
Good.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.124
No more understanding over here.

17:47.845 --> 17:49.767
No more misunderstanding.

17:49.807 --> 17:53.771
Yeah, you understand.

17:53.831 --> 17:55.092
It's about a misunderstanding.

17:55.192 --> 17:58.956
Okay.

17:59.596 --> 18:05.022
Actually, we wanted to share a little bit more about ourselves today with you, you know?

18:06.092 --> 18:11.237
I know we've mentioned it here and there, but your host, FUWAMOCO, is us.

18:11.477 --> 18:14.340
We're from a place called the Northwest Passage.

18:14.621 --> 18:16.182
You know, that's our home.

18:16.302 --> 18:17.624
The FUWAMOCO home.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.405
Moco-chan, do you have a drawing?

18:19.646 --> 18:19.966
I do.

18:19.986 --> 18:21.507
I have a couple drawings.

18:21.648 --> 18:22.428
Oh, let's share them.

18:25.578 --> 18:28.720
This is kind of what the Northwest Passage looks like.

18:31.501 --> 18:31.841
Listen!

18:32.381 --> 18:35.102
The Northwest Passage is located within the Makai.

18:35.243 --> 18:37.143
The Makai is like the Demon World.

18:37.644 --> 18:41.826
And that's why it's in the PT Time Zone.

18:42.266 --> 18:44.627
And you know, the Northwest Passage is really nice.

18:45.147 --> 18:46.948
It is kind of boring at the same time though.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.702
It can be a bit rainy.

18:49.722 --> 18:50.984
There's lots of trees.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.064
It's okay though, you know?

18:52.625 --> 18:55.067
I think the human world is much more exciting though.

18:55.868 --> 19:00.492
Nature, it's a bit more grand than the human world, I think.

19:01.533 --> 19:04.655
We have nice weather too, but there's a lot of rain too.

19:04.835 --> 19:07.498
But it's really pretty when it is nice, you know?

19:09.579 --> 19:11.141
I think, you know, there's a lot of...

19:12.522 --> 19:13.763
Trees.

19:13.783 --> 19:15.686
A lot of trees.

19:17.388 --> 19:18.108
Rocks.

19:18.389 --> 19:19.890
And some water too.

19:20.171 --> 19:22.914
And you know, it's sparkly when it's bright.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.115
I like that.

19:24.295 --> 19:27.799
And you know when we were just puppies, it was really fun playing outside.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.281
Playing in all the seasons.

19:30.595 --> 19:35.278
I think maybe the puppies now don't really do that as much.

19:36.179 --> 19:39.261
But, I don't know.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.803
I'm happy that we were able to do that.

19:41.983 --> 19:42.323
Right!

19:42.503 --> 19:45.765
Yeah, more and more demon puppies.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.468
Demon dog puppies.

19:50.509 --> 19:52.370
They're just stuck on the devices, you know?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.092
You know, how are you supposed to make

19:56.016 --> 20:02.002
It's good to have something that you like that's an indoor thing, you know, for maybe when it's raining.

20:02.042 --> 20:03.643
But, you know, it's good to go outside.

20:03.663 --> 20:06.406
There's a lot of skills that you can build up there.

20:18.937 --> 20:26.823
If you like lessons, you'll be like, oh, I miss those days when I could run free in the grass and the trees, you know?

20:26.863 --> 20:30.606
But the internet can also help with other skills, too.

20:30.746 --> 20:33.728
But other important skills need to be developed offline, too, right?

20:34.108 --> 20:40.653
We should all be careful of how we spend our time online and limit it to what's important to us, right?

20:40.953 --> 20:41.374
Balance.

20:41.454 --> 20:42.274
Balance is key.

20:42.534 --> 20:42.895
Yeah.

20:44.856 --> 20:49.217
As for Demon Dogs, there's a lot of different Demon Dogs.

20:49.457 --> 20:55.899
We all undergo different training and take on different kinds of tasks.

20:57.219 --> 21:00.760
But for us, we're Demon Guard Dogs.

21:01.240 --> 21:05.941
And actually, there's a job that every Demon Guard Dog wants.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.142
Ruffians, you know maybe?

21:10.751 --> 21:16.656
Okay well, it's actually protecting the big door, the gate to the Moco.

21:16.857 --> 21:19.239
That's the number one sort of job.

21:19.259 --> 21:22.381
It's kind of like becoming an astronaut in the human world.

21:22.562 --> 21:26.665
Every parent puppy wants their little puppies to do that job, you know?

21:28.687 --> 21:32.529
We're only the very, very best guard dogs get chosen for that position.

21:32.549 --> 21:43.056
It's still just, you know, a bit of a dream for us, but I think, you know, we're really, really happy right now to be here with you, protecting your smiles.

21:43.076 --> 21:46.538
We're gonna do our best and focus on that.

21:47.619 --> 21:50.360
There's also other kinds of Demon Dogs too, you know?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.042
Not just Demon Guard Dogs, right?

21:52.062 --> 21:56.525
There's Demon Police Dogs, Demon Dentist Dogs, Therapy Dogs.

21:56.685 --> 21:58.626
You know, all sorts of Demon Dogs.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.107
And of course there's us, right?

22:01.428 --> 22:05.370
But you know, having a job and a purpose is what makes us all the most happy.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.072
I have another drawing.

22:07.952 --> 22:08.212
This!

22:12.711 --> 22:19.195
This is our home that we grew up in, you know, the Abyssgard home.

22:19.476 --> 22:23.378
You know, our family, it consists of Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy.

22:23.658 --> 22:27.561
Our home may look a little bit small, but it's actually really, really big.

22:27.621 --> 22:29.542
Mama Puppy, Papa Puppy, and then us.

22:30.883 --> 22:31.804
That's it.

22:32.404 --> 22:35.886
You know, we did think that maybe it'd be nice to have like a little brother.

22:35.906 --> 22:40.610
It'd be fun, you know, maybe bully them, make them do stuff for us.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.291
But then also,

22:43.111 --> 22:45.472
As for Papa Puppy... Papa Puppy?

23:04.036 --> 23:14.563
Papa Puppy is a bit of a stricter BAU BAU kind of Papa Puppy.

23:15.244 --> 23:17.805
He's a tough, tough one.

23:17.865 --> 23:24.470
Papa Puppy might not really show his love outwardly, but it's very, very much there.

23:24.490 --> 23:24.970
Deep down.

23:27.452 --> 23:28.353
BAU BAU!

23:28.453 --> 23:29.434
BAU BAU!

23:29.554 --> 23:30.114
BAU BAU!

23:30.214 --> 23:31.115
BAU BAU!

23:31.435 --> 23:33.317
And the Mama Puppy!

23:34.018 --> 23:35.979
She's a bit geeky too.

23:35.999 --> 23:40.923
She really likes science fiction, novels, and games too.

23:41.184 --> 23:44.626
But we didn't say anything, okay?

23:46.188 --> 23:52.633
It's a secret because she finds it embarrassing for old dogs to play new games.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.194
We didn't say anything, okay?

23:55.355 --> 23:59.679
And we used to play games all together, but we're still just Puppies.

23:59.699 --> 24:05.264
So Mama Puppy kinda sounds like BAU BAU.

24:05.504 --> 24:06.645
Right?

24:06.885 --> 24:12.330
But both Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy, they only speak dog and a little bit of English.

24:12.390 --> 24:15.453
So you won't be able to meet them.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.878
It'll be hard to communicate all together, you know?

24:18.898 --> 24:23.119
But that's a little bit about us, about our upbringing.

24:23.539 --> 24:28.821
And you know, we hope that that kind of brings us a bit more together, you know?

24:28.841 --> 24:31.601
I think there's a lot of mystery up until now, no?

24:31.981 --> 24:36.423
Well, the Makai is Wakai, and Northwest Passage is in the Makai.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.363
It's easy to understand, right?

24:38.923 --> 24:43.805
I would say that come visit, but it's best that you don't come to the Makai.

24:44.665 --> 24:45.806
I think it's a bit difficult.

24:45.826 --> 24:48.588
The human world is where all puppies belong.

24:48.969 --> 24:50.290
Papa puppy, mama puppy.

24:50.310 --> 24:50.970
That's their name.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.891
That's what we call them.

24:51.931 --> 24:54.053
Yeah, since we were just puppies.

24:54.173 --> 24:57.536
You know, we could be like mama dog and daddy dog.

24:57.556 --> 25:01.959
But this is what we've been calling them since we were little.

25:03.969 --> 25:04.229
Yeah.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.351
And no!

25:06.631 --> 25:08.873
Momopapi and Papa Puppy are not single.

25:10.054 --> 25:10.234
What?

25:10.615 --> 25:10.795
What?

25:10.835 --> 25:11.135
What?

25:11.235 --> 25:11.615
No!

25:11.976 --> 25:12.936
Everyone asks that!

25:12.976 --> 25:14.398
Why is everyone asking that?

25:14.518 --> 25:15.919
Ruffians are asking that!

25:16.599 --> 25:21.563
Use your brain.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.465
That's a little bit more about us.

25:23.665 --> 25:24.786
A little bit more about us.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.814
But let's move right into our next corner.

25:29.354 --> 25:32.459
We have our Doggie of the Day!

25:32.479 --> 25:33.200
De-den!

25:34.221 --> 25:35.083
Look!

25:35.403 --> 25:38.227
It's Cupcake!

25:38.267 --> 25:39.749
She's the goodest girl.

25:40.876 --> 25:42.498
I don't think there's any doubt about that.

25:42.718 --> 25:43.499
Look at that face.

25:43.719 --> 25:43.960
Right?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.081
The radiant coat.

25:45.101 --> 25:46.683
The beautiful shiny butt.

25:46.703 --> 25:48.204
The nose.

25:49.045 --> 25:50.707
It's just too cute.

25:51.408 --> 25:54.792
You sort of feel like you want to boop it, but you can't just do a normal boop.

25:54.892 --> 25:57.394
It has to be nose to nose boop.

25:57.455 --> 25:58.255
Nose boops?

25:58.416 --> 25:59.857
Nose to nose.

25:59.977 --> 26:00.758
Moco-chan, that's...

26:03.151 --> 26:04.693
Is that good of a nose?

26:04.793 --> 26:05.975
That good of a nose?

26:06.435 --> 26:06.936
Yeah.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.038
She looks super sweet like a cupcake.

26:09.299 --> 26:10.600
What do you think a cupcake sounds like?

26:15.765 --> 26:36.237
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

26:36.749 --> 26:37.069
Thank you!

26:37.089 --> 26:37.429
BAU BAU!

26:37.469 --> 26:39.170
And next we have... Today I went on a walk.

27:01.485 --> 27:04.067
De-den!

27:04.167 --> 27:05.669
This is a good walk.

27:05.689 --> 27:07.690
It's so beautiful.

27:07.991 --> 27:09.252
What do you think, Ruffians?

27:10.012 --> 27:12.555
What do you think the best thing about this walk is?

27:13.035 --> 27:17.159
This looks like a nice walk in Japan, maybe?

27:17.659 --> 27:19.140
And all the beautiful scenery.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.022
But there's a friend there too!

27:21.042 --> 27:22.923
A cat with a good...

27:23.644 --> 27:24.104
Behind.

27:24.124 --> 27:29.827
You know, I think that if we were on this walk... Kurikaeri pose.

27:29.887 --> 27:30.548
Yeah, yeah.

27:30.628 --> 27:33.649
We'd probably go and quickly turn it into a run, right?

27:33.829 --> 27:34.070
Yeah.

27:34.130 --> 27:34.730
A sprint!

27:34.750 --> 27:36.871
It's no longer a walk, it's time to run.

27:37.111 --> 27:37.771
Yeah.

27:37.791 --> 27:39.012
The tail's so cute.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.993
Nice and round.

27:41.794 --> 27:42.554
The thighs.

27:44.335 --> 27:45.956
I think this was a very good walk.

27:46.116 --> 27:47.577
Mococo, what?

27:47.617 --> 27:49.157
No, this is a normal reaction!

27:49.177 --> 27:50.838
This is a normal reaction?

27:51.078 --> 27:51.279
Yeah.

27:53.274 --> 27:55.495
Thank you, we're glad you had such a good one!

27:55.595 --> 27:57.756
Yeah, we're happy you made a new friend.

27:58.217 --> 28:00.138
BAU BAU!

28:01.318 --> 28:03.880
And finally we have our Question of the Day.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.060
We got a very good question.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.762
Let's take a look at it.

28:09.543 --> 28:20.229
I don't even know where to present this thought, but being a Spanish-speaking viewer, I've been eager to ask, what does Mococo, nicknamed Only Moco, think about her name literally meaning...

28:25.639 --> 28:27.280
Thank you girls for everything you've done!

28:27.320 --> 28:27.980
Thank you!

28:28.060 --> 28:33.183
BAU BAU!

28:38.346 --> 28:39.507
It's embarrassing.

28:40.868 --> 28:49.013
But... I think that as long as you remember that I'm Moco-chan, then... I'm happy.

28:51.092 --> 28:51.452
I guess?

28:53.833 --> 28:54.133
Yeah.

28:54.413 --> 28:58.253
I guess Moco-chan is a pretty unique name then for you, right?

28:58.313 --> 29:00.774
Then nobody else is called Moco-chan.

29:00.834 --> 29:02.494
True, nobody would want to be named that.

29:04.794 --> 29:07.635
I'm just happy to be the only Moco-chan for you, okay?

29:07.655 --> 29:08.235
True, true, true.

29:08.255 --> 29:09.495
That's a good way to look at it.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.516
Yeah, yeah.

29:11.576 --> 29:17.237
But... You wouldn't just crumple me up into a tissue and toss me away, right?

29:18.337 --> 29:18.557
Right!

29:20.677 --> 29:22.078
I'm not something dirty, right?

29:23.919 --> 29:24.139
No.

29:24.579 --> 29:25.560
I'm to be treasured.

29:27.901 --> 29:30.602
You said it yourself.

29:30.702 --> 29:31.743
Okay, well.

29:31.883 --> 29:32.283
Right!

29:32.383 --> 29:33.464
Let's keep on moving.

29:33.704 --> 29:34.725
Let's keep on moving.

29:36.265 --> 29:38.287
Maybe YouTube is a bit heavy right now.

29:38.807 --> 29:39.667
YouTube.

29:39.687 --> 29:40.428
Become light.

29:40.808 --> 29:41.908
YouTube.

29:42.049 --> 29:42.509
Bonk bonk.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.010
Bonk bonk bonk.

29:44.930 --> 29:45.450
Moving on.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.252
We'll take a look at our very next stream here.

29:48.292 --> 29:48.612
Then...

29:50.922 --> 30:00.617
We're going to be playing Spooky's Jump Scare Mountain once again today.

30:00.637 --> 30:01.438
We're going back.

30:02.419 --> 30:04.182
We got to almost 350 of the thousand rooms.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.846
It's been really scary.

30:08.627 --> 30:10.468
But I just think that we made it pretty fun, right?

30:10.508 --> 30:11.569
I think we did pretty good.

30:12.830 --> 30:15.492
We were not very brave, but we did it.

30:15.512 --> 30:18.575
But, you know, we're working together, all together.

30:18.595 --> 30:21.517
You know, Moco-chan's being the feet and I'm being the run.

30:21.597 --> 30:21.797
Right.

30:21.817 --> 30:24.660
And then the ruffians are giving us all the advice.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.301
Don't look behind or look behind.

30:26.321 --> 30:27.102
Those kind of things.

30:27.762 --> 30:28.183
Right.

30:29.003 --> 30:31.324
I really hope that we can get to even more floors.

30:31.365 --> 30:32.885
Maybe we can get to, like, 750?

30:32.925 --> 30:33.606
Like, improve?

30:33.626 --> 30:35.247
That would be cool.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.487
That would be nice.

30:36.928 --> 30:37.688
Yeah.

30:37.728 --> 30:41.210
We'll do our best at the boss now, but... Yeah.

30:41.270 --> 30:41.971
I'm a bit nervous.

30:42.051 --> 30:44.132
Yeah, because right now with the boss, right?

30:44.172 --> 30:45.813
We need to keep looking at him, right?

30:46.473 --> 30:47.374
I don't wanna look.

30:47.414 --> 30:53.677
I don't wanna look, and I feel like that's gonna be difficult, but... Do you think we can make it past him, Ruffians?

30:54.398 --> 30:55.078
We better.

30:56.759 --> 30:57.640
We better.

30:59.725 --> 31:03.648
Our YouTube is back down!

31:04.169 --> 31:06.610
Well, let's take a quick look at our schedule too.

31:07.051 --> 31:09.893
We posted it on Twitter and to the YouTube community.

31:10.253 --> 31:12.955
So, if you haven't seen it yet, you can see it in more detail there.

31:13.095 --> 31:14.216
But, we're done.

31:14.236 --> 31:15.958
Our schedule.

31:17.332 --> 31:21.734
First, we have another FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

31:21.754 --> 31:27.536
It was so much fun the other day, but this time, it's back with only hololive songs.

31:28.116 --> 31:29.256
Only hololive songs.

31:29.717 --> 31:34.098
Thank you so much for your suggestions over at the hashtag FWMCBEATS.

31:34.258 --> 31:36.259
We already checked them all out.

31:36.479 --> 31:40.401
It's been really helping us decide what kind of songs you'd like to see us sing.

31:43.583 --> 31:47.166
If we don't sing the song that you'd like to hear this time, don't worry.

31:47.926 --> 31:50.728
We will have more opportunities in the future.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.190
This is just the first time, right?

31:52.330 --> 31:54.351
I guarantee you we do want to sing that song.

31:56.028 --> 31:57.009
It's just the first time.

31:57.309 --> 32:00.090
We can only sing so much at once.

32:00.911 --> 32:05.313
We'll also be appearing on Kiara-senpai's holotalk earlier that day.

32:05.553 --> 32:06.854
It's gonna be a busy day, huh?

32:06.894 --> 32:08.915
It's gonna be a busy big day, you know?

32:08.955 --> 32:13.297
This will be our first collab with a senpai and a member outside of Alvin.

32:13.677 --> 32:15.178
So we're really really really excited.

32:16.619 --> 32:18.040
Please don't miss out on it, okay?

32:18.080 --> 32:20.221
It's gonna be over at Kiara-senpai's channel.

32:20.802 --> 32:21.982
You have to be there, okay?

32:22.643 --> 32:26.906
Also, we want you to know there's been a little change.

32:28.166 --> 32:35.631
We were planning on playing River City Girls, but we'll have to actually bump it to the future a little bit.

32:35.892 --> 32:37.473
Just for now, just for now.

32:38.033 --> 32:39.754
It'll be okay.

32:39.774 --> 32:42.516
We're sorry to the Ruffians, we're really looking forward to it.

32:42.536 --> 32:45.038
We hope you don't feel too disappointed.

32:46.619 --> 32:49.480
We did our best, but there was nothing we could do this time.

32:50.321 --> 32:53.362
But we'll be back to typing on the dead this time.

32:53.743 --> 32:58.385
So we hope that you look forward to finishing it all together with us this time.

32:58.966 --> 33:05.549
We really, really do everything we can to avoid any last minute changes like this, but sometimes, you know, it's hard.

33:07.550 --> 33:08.211
We'll do our best.

33:08.231 --> 33:10.052
We don't want to ever let you down, so...

33:11.590 --> 33:13.131
We'll keep on improving, okay?

33:13.211 --> 33:17.192
We'll do our best to do better, okay?

33:20.453 --> 33:34.038
Well, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

33:34.838 --> 33:35.859
Ruffians, are you ready?

33:41.292 --> 33:42.553

We hope you have a howl of a day!

34:04.063 --> 34:06.945
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:07.066 --> 34:09.007
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

34:09.207 --> 34:11.409
BAU BAU!
