05:17.748 --> 05:19.730
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:20.391 --> 05:23.774
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:23.894 --> 05:26.637
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:29.559 --> 05:33.921
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:34.381 --> 05:36.862
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:37.203 --> 05:39.804
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:39.944 --> 05:41.765
BAU BAU!

05:41.785 --> 05:46.407
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:46.667 --> 05:47.467
Ruffians!

05:47.687 --> 05:48.608
Are you awake?

05:48.868 --> 05:49.308
You awake?

05:49.328 --> 05:50.669
Are you ready for a new week?

05:50.869 --> 05:51.429
Yeah!

05:51.549 --> 05:53.350
Because this week's extra special!

05:53.410 --> 05:54.530
Important, important!

05:54.671 --> 05:56.411
It's our 3D week!

05:56.631 --> 05:57.472
BAU BAU!

05:59.843 --> 06:07.851
But that aside... Thank you so much for waking up and joining us today for our 114th episode!

06:08.211 --> 06:08.932
Mama!

06:09.012 --> 06:11.594
Mama!

06:11.654 --> 06:12.055
Yo!

06:12.095 --> 06:12.315
CD!

06:13.216 --> 06:13.296
Yeah!

06:13.316 --> 06:13.336
3D!

06:13.896 --> 06:15.898
So excited!

06:17.980 --> 06:19.402
Don't forget Pero's birthday.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.446
FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:35.742 --> 06:38.364
Maybe you're joining us for the first time and you don't know.

06:38.404 --> 06:39.064
That's okay.

06:39.164 --> 06:41.486
What's a 3D, huh?

06:42.086 --> 06:50.152
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.833
Today is not FUWAMOCO.

06:51.973 --> 06:52.213
No.

06:52.574 --> 06:54.155
Friday, Wednesday, Monday, FUWAMOCO.

06:54.175 --> 06:57.157
But it's hosted by FUWAMOCO!

06:57.657 --> 07:03.501
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:03.662 --> 07:08.885
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:09.066 --> 07:12.788
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:12.848 --> 07:14.770
BAU BAU!

07:14.910 --> 07:17.091
BAU BAU!

07:17.111 --> 07:17.452
BAU BAU!

07:17.492 --> 07:17.792
BAU BAU!

07:18.112 --> 07:22.255
It's gonna be a good week, Ruffians.

07:22.555 --> 07:23.976
It's gonna be a good week.

07:26.218 --> 07:28.079
BAU BAU!

07:28.579 --> 07:32.121
And we're stating it on the right paw because we're together.

07:32.141 --> 07:35.262
And it's FUWAMOCO Morning for Moco-chan!

07:36.443 --> 07:38.344
What do we have to make the day even better, huh?

07:38.884 --> 07:39.404
Well!

07:40.805 --> 07:42.986
De-den!

07:43.486 --> 07:46.847
I don't see anything there but it says Pero Sighting, Moco-chan.

07:47.368 --> 07:50.749
Well, there's been no Pero Sighting again!

07:50.769 --> 07:53.310
Good, good start.

07:53.771 --> 07:54.351
Ruffian.

07:56.985 --> 07:59.086
I've really not been seeing Pero around.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.608
I'm seeing some rumors.

08:03.849 --> 08:05.370
Very silly rumors.

08:07.472 --> 08:08.873
That's not factual though.

08:09.213 --> 08:09.793
Baseless.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.135
Baseless rumors.

08:12.495 --> 08:14.676
He's the Great Perroccino!

08:15.137 --> 08:15.937
His words, not mine.

08:16.778 --> 08:17.238
Yeah.

08:17.398 --> 08:17.778
Okay.

08:18.259 --> 08:18.539
Yeah.

08:19.352 --> 08:21.875
But I think they're strange Ruffians.

08:22.276 --> 08:24.979
Please let us know if you see them, okay?

08:24.999 --> 08:25.400
Okay!

08:25.800 --> 08:27.722
Especially now it's a 3D week.

08:30.025 --> 08:30.546
Oh yeah.

08:30.926 --> 08:31.467
Who knows?

08:31.587 --> 08:32.048
Who knows?

08:33.118 --> 08:35.699
BAU BAU!

08:36.659 --> 08:37.920
Organize a search!

08:37.980 --> 08:38.740
A search?

08:38.820 --> 08:40.481
Why would we go to that length?

08:41.401 --> 08:44.802
I mean, you know if you're going about your day, like, what's that at all?

08:45.222 --> 08:45.782
Let us know.

08:45.862 --> 08:48.223
Not go like, okay, forget my day plan!

08:48.263 --> 08:49.063
No search parties!

08:49.544 --> 08:53.305
It's not that kind of... No search parties, a birthday party later, I guess.

08:54.045 --> 09:04.754
FUWAMOCO, just a few days ago we released our first original song, Boy To Be Balladon!

09:09.598 --> 09:10.819
Thank you, Ruffians!

09:10.879 --> 09:14.221
We've already hit a huge milestone!

09:14.661 --> 09:17.002
We hit 250,000 views on YouTube!

09:17.102 --> 09:17.903
BAU BAU!

09:17.963 --> 09:18.623
Thank you!

09:18.883 --> 09:24.666
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

09:24.806 --> 09:27.928
We're so happy that you love it so much!

09:27.948 --> 09:30.109
We are so excited!

09:31.530 --> 09:34.355
Have you finally been able to listen to it too?

09:35.016 --> 09:37.960
In case you know, we've been a little bit busy last week.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.744
Well, it was our first year anniversary!

09:41.245 --> 09:45.791
And we celebrate it by releasing our first original song, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★!

09:46.092 --> 09:47.073
It's a song written by...

09:47.634 --> 09:49.055
PandaBoY-san.

09:49.095 --> 09:55.942
PandaBoY-san has written a bunch of our favorite idol songs as well as hololive songs too, like Blue Clapper.

09:56.282 --> 09:58.324
So please have a listen at here!

09:58.424 --> 09:59.205
Yattaiga!

09:59.625 --> 10:00.826
Yattaiga!

10:01.187 --> 10:05.030
But here we also have a very cute little pony FUWAMOCO.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.592
The MV was made by Sato.

10:06.692 --> 10:09.214
Yeah, please check it out, okay?

10:09.715 --> 10:12.117
But it means a lot because you know,

10:12.697 --> 10:17.044
It's our first original song, and you know, it's very FUWAMOCO!

10:17.364 --> 10:18.606
We BAU BAU.

10:18.626 --> 10:21.010
We really like to play to one day.

10:21.851 --> 10:23.634
1 million views one day.

10:27.559 --> 10:28.440
Running.

10:28.480 --> 10:28.901
Workout.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.161
Work.

10:43.559 --> 10:54.383
Also, we had an afterparty where we kind of shared the best way to be able to cheer for us and we performed it live and enjoyed lots and lots of all the Ruffians everywhere.

10:54.423 --> 10:59.925
So you can check that out and let you know maybe while you're working out you can be like FUWAMOCO!

10:59.945 --> 11:00.905
FUWAMOCO!

11:06.447 --> 11:09.368
You saved it in your holo earphones!

11:09.448 --> 11:10.308
BAU BAU!

11:11.108 --> 11:13.209
We're so happy to be included!

11:13.569 --> 11:18.990
And we hope that we can release more Rachel music soon to Ruffians!

11:19.030 --> 11:22.151
Please keep listening to it lots and lots again!

11:22.171 --> 11:23.011
BAU BAU!

11:23.491 --> 11:25.292
It's not easy, okay, Ruffians?

11:26.012 --> 11:26.513
BAU BAU!

11:26.533 --> 11:27.093
Thank you, Ruffians!

11:48.165 --> 11:54.231
Speaking of low-poly 3D, I think I can take a little high-poly one.

11:54.271 --> 11:57.714
Because Biboo and Shiori, they just had their 3D debut!

11:57.854 --> 11:59.756
And first up, it was Shiori!

12:01.918 --> 12:04.582
That was amazing, Ruffians!

12:04.883 --> 12:05.704
You saw it, right?

12:06.265 --> 12:07.066
It was intense!

12:07.126 --> 12:09.209
That was so Shiori!

12:09.249 --> 12:10.811
I was dying!

12:10.871 --> 12:12.293
She's so cute!

12:12.414 --> 12:13.555
It was so Shiori!

12:13.615 --> 12:14.356
Shiori!

12:14.697 --> 12:16.540
You know, she's so silly, just...

12:16.920 --> 12:18.681
Shiori being Shiori, but then... Really?

12:18.721 --> 12:19.501
You get to see her?

12:19.541 --> 12:22.423
We were so happy to be able to be a part of it.

12:22.643 --> 12:23.844
Yeah.

12:24.064 --> 12:25.345
Yeah.

12:25.525 --> 12:28.446
But, you know, the first song she had was Gawaii.

12:28.526 --> 12:28.907
Yeah!

12:29.127 --> 12:31.048
And it was so intense!

12:31.228 --> 12:35.730
Yeah, and all of Shiori's singing practice and lessons really paid off too.

12:35.870 --> 12:36.150
Right.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.171
I caught goosebumps.

12:38.272 --> 12:39.672
And then, Rainy Boots!

12:39.692 --> 12:41.393
She danced around in the rain!

12:41.593 --> 12:41.893
Yeah!

12:41.913 --> 12:44.315
With her spiky boots and the umbrella.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.196
Yeah, all the music suited her right!

12:47.536 --> 12:50.098
I didn't know any of the songs, but now they're all hers to me.

12:50.118 --> 12:51.418
They're all her songs now.

12:52.459 --> 12:53.019
Yeah.

12:53.679 --> 12:57.721
But she really did improve so much too!

12:57.781 --> 13:04.424
I think definitely, I mean it's most of her songs, but we like got Rainy Boots and Hoshi o Watari Tori the best.

13:04.504 --> 13:05.465
Yeah, so much.

13:05.905 --> 13:08.606
I saw a comment that they're waiting for us to watch Shiori's.

13:08.946 --> 13:09.427
What?

13:09.527 --> 13:12.228
But you can get so excited and hype now and see Shiori's!

13:12.288 --> 13:13.709
Watch them in order, okay?

13:13.789 --> 13:17.330
Shiori, then Biboo, then Nerissa, then... What?

13:17.950 --> 13:21.592
Shiori, then Biboo, then Shiori... That's not right!

13:21.892 --> 13:25.814
Shiori, then Biboo, then Nerissa, then FUWAMOCO, then Advent.

13:26.174 --> 13:26.955
Yeah!

13:27.335 --> 13:27.635
Okay.

13:28.735 --> 13:31.516
You had a full advent experience, right?

13:31.596 --> 13:32.157
Yeah.

13:32.257 --> 13:34.298
Oh yeah, there was Kabedon, right?

13:34.318 --> 13:39.280
That was... I was like, oh my goodness.

13:40.521 --> 13:41.441
Shiori!

13:42.262 --> 13:42.762
Yeah.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.143
So proud of her, right?

13:44.183 --> 13:47.104
Yeah, it's a good thing, you know, that you just cut the feed, right?

13:47.124 --> 13:48.265
See, look how cute she is!

13:48.325 --> 13:49.005
Yeah!

13:49.085 --> 13:50.546
I was screaming!

13:50.726 --> 13:51.266
Ruffians!

13:51.286 --> 13:52.187
We were like, what?!

13:52.687 --> 13:53.908
That's illegal!

13:56.062 --> 13:56.903
She's illegal.

13:57.623 --> 13:59.624
Too cute.

14:00.104 --> 14:01.565
Yeah, it was so good, right?

14:01.765 --> 14:05.087
How do you not just run right through the screen into her arms?

14:05.147 --> 14:06.008
They're open!

14:06.288 --> 14:08.109
They're open!

14:08.909 --> 14:09.630
She needs the hug!

14:09.650 --> 14:10.370
She needs the hug!

14:10.590 --> 14:11.431
Yeah, right.

14:11.571 --> 14:12.371
Amazing shot.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.373
Right at Fuwawa Cameraman.

14:15.653 --> 14:18.795
I caught the screenshot, so thank you for the compliment.

14:19.255 --> 14:19.475
So cute!

14:19.495 --> 14:19.835
It was so good!

14:19.855 --> 14:20.356
But then after that!

14:20.416 --> 14:21.056
Look, look, look!

14:21.076 --> 14:21.837
I just want to play that, you know?

14:21.857 --> 14:22.997

My family!

14:41.308 --> 14:41.548
My family!

14:41.568 --> 14:41.849
My family!

14:41.869 --> 14:42.089
My family!

14:42.109 --> 14:42.289
My family!

14:42.309 --> 14:42.489
My family!

14:45.938 --> 14:47.598
I'm so glad you went on!

14:47.658 --> 14:49.679
You heard her original song, right, Ruffians?

14:49.719 --> 14:49.879
Right!

14:49.899 --> 14:50.959
Right from the very beginning!

14:50.979 --> 14:51.759
Did you notice?

14:51.779 --> 14:52.600
Did you notice?

14:52.620 --> 14:54.140
Prison no Mahou!

14:54.160 --> 14:54.520
Yeah!

14:54.540 --> 15:14.485
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

15:16.507 --> 15:19.908
No one's ever had the Pebblemont Party.

15:20.028 --> 15:20.429
Right.

15:20.969 --> 15:24.390
I feel like there was so much jam packed into it.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.110
Right.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.971
But we got so emotional doing Orange.

15:28.991 --> 15:30.351
You know, Orange Heart, Oradora.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.412
Together with Kaila-senpai!

15:33.072 --> 15:35.073
It was so cute!

15:35.133 --> 15:35.933
It was so cute.

15:36.133 --> 15:36.573
Yeah.

15:36.733 --> 15:37.313
Yeah.

15:41.264 --> 15:43.686
Oh, and then there's also Gio!

15:43.706 --> 15:43.766
Gio!

15:44.086 --> 15:45.908
Did you notice?

15:46.248 --> 15:48.770
We finally got to see Gio.

15:48.790 --> 15:48.850
Gio!

15:49.391 --> 15:50.151
He returned.

15:50.512 --> 15:54.154
Yeah, Biboo's body.

15:54.174 --> 15:55.095
Very cute.

15:55.596 --> 15:57.397
Not as fluffy as me, though.

15:57.677 --> 15:58.338
No, no.

15:58.918 --> 15:59.939
His ears, though.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.982
Gio's not nasty.

16:07.222 --> 16:13.269
Do you think Gio has to take a lot of baths with ears that long?

16:13.750 --> 16:16.252
Instead of dragging everywhere, I want them to get muddy.

16:16.272 --> 16:16.332
Gio.

16:16.413 --> 16:16.573
Gio.

16:16.613 --> 16:17.073
Gio.

16:23.305 --> 16:27.489
But, you know, Biboo and Shiori, they're both so good at singing!

16:27.589 --> 16:28.209
So good!

16:28.349 --> 16:31.532
And their dancing was so cute, too!

16:31.552 --> 16:35.075
It's just wonderful seeing them before I was.

16:35.135 --> 16:36.376
And look at the cute Biboo!

16:36.416 --> 16:37.137
Yeah!

16:38.458 --> 16:38.758
Again!

16:38.778 --> 16:41.741
Biboo's like, I wanna hug!

16:41.801 --> 16:45.124
Why is she always screaming so loud?

16:45.184 --> 16:46.765
She's like, I wanna hug!

16:46.785 --> 16:47.105
But why?

16:47.526 --> 16:49.387
Yeah, her expressions are so cute!

16:50.648 --> 16:53.493
Oh, now you wanna see Pero and Gio battle it out?

16:53.513 --> 16:57.219
That would be scary.

16:57.239 --> 16:59.122
They're both great, huh?

17:02.147 --> 17:03.790
I wonder why what happened, huh?

17:04.211 --> 17:04.772
Yeah.

17:07.454 --> 17:09.456
And we both got the same screenshot!

17:09.816 --> 17:12.757
We can't help it when Biboo is that cute, right?

17:12.777 --> 17:14.518
So cute!

17:14.558 --> 17:20.061
But Ruffians, you're not forgetting, right?

17:20.081 --> 17:25.644
It's gonna be Nerissa and our CD this upcoming weekend!

17:25.944 --> 17:29.526
Nerissa hers is on the 9th at 8pm PT.

17:29.646 --> 17:32.968
And FUWAMOCO on the 10th at 8pm PT as well.

17:35.309 --> 17:36.789
Please put it in your calendars!

17:37.189 --> 17:38.250
It's not too far off!

17:38.590 --> 17:39.330
It really isn't!

17:39.450 --> 17:40.290
I'm really worried!

17:40.470 --> 17:40.850
Yeah.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.411
Yeah, so we're practicing as much as we can.

17:43.431 --> 17:45.091
You'll be there to support us, right, Ruffians?

17:46.571 --> 17:49.272
You'll watch with kind eyes, right?

17:49.292 --> 17:51.632
We practiced so much, Ruffians!

17:51.992 --> 17:55.033
We put every little bit of love and fun as we could.

17:55.593 --> 17:56.533
So, yeah.

17:56.793 --> 17:58.374
We're gonna do our best, okay?

17:58.754 --> 18:00.454
Be there with headpats, okay?

18:00.474 --> 18:00.554
Yeah.

18:02.515 --> 18:02.995
Don't be late.

18:03.115 --> 18:03.735
I'm so nervous.

18:04.788 --> 18:06.248
BAU BAU!

18:06.328 --> 18:07.749
I hope we can sleep.

18:08.309 --> 18:08.989
It'll be there.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.310
BAU BAU!

18:12.410 --> 18:13.410
Thank you, BAU BAU!

18:13.430 --> 18:16.111
And then after us, of course, there's the Advent Club the next week.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.272
So don't forget about that, okay?

18:19.712 --> 18:21.772
BAU BAU!

18:22.072 --> 18:29.214
Well, also, something exciting going on next weekend is the big Summer Comiket 2024!

18:29.294 --> 18:30.515
BAU BAU!

18:32.235 --> 18:38.779
I hear you talk about it almost every time there's Comiket, but if you're not too sure what Comiket is, it stands for Comic Market.

18:39.119 --> 18:44.462
It's one of the biggest anime comic events in all of Japan, and it happens twice a year.

18:44.922 --> 18:46.743
Once in summer and once in winter.

18:46.783 --> 18:48.564
You know Comiket already, right?

18:48.684 --> 18:50.385
Yeah, it's like the battle of the elements.

18:50.605 --> 18:51.966
And there's cosplayers there.

18:51.986 --> 18:54.487
Of course they have their own cosplayer area.

18:55.087 --> 19:00.231
But mainly it's for fan-made comics, fan-made works.

19:00.532 --> 19:04.355
There's also music, also merchandise, fan-made merchandise.

19:04.375 --> 19:08.618
There's also an industry area as well.

19:09.119 --> 19:11.961
So there's a bunch of different things to check out.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.556
We are the most excited about the fan comments!

19:18.717 --> 19:21.640
So it's the same date as our debut.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.100
It is!

19:22.320 --> 19:25.323
The same date as FUWAMOCO's 3D debut!

19:25.643 --> 19:27.685
At the same time too!

19:27.705 --> 19:32.370
Comiket starts early, only for a couple hours from the morning until the afternoon.

19:33.651 --> 19:38.217
Well, FUWAMOCO's debut at noon JST is.

19:38.317 --> 19:39.779
So you know, Icomochi-mama.

19:39.819 --> 19:42.062
Icomochi-mama's gonna be a comiket.

19:42.082 --> 19:43.204
A bit busy, huh?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.006
Bit of a busy day, you know?

19:45.066 --> 19:47.610
But maybe Icomochi-mama can watch at the Ruffians.

19:47.730 --> 19:48.211
Maybe.

19:48.991 --> 19:52.613
Watch Party.

19:53.313 --> 19:59.795
Of course, FUWAMOCO, we'd love to go on a cool weekend, but it's a bit of a busy day for us.

19:59.955 --> 20:04.017
Just a little bit.

20:04.037 --> 20:08.159
I don't think we can just kind of skip out on the things we have planned that day.

20:08.179 --> 20:14.121
I think you will be a bit sad if suddenly, where's FUWAMOCO for their 50th debut and why is it just empty?

20:14.341 --> 20:18.024
FUWAMOCO decided to go to Big Sight!

20:18.324 --> 20:28.951
But you know FUWAMOCO, one of my big dreams for my debut is to get our paws on FUWAMOCO family.

20:29.091 --> 20:32.794
And Comiket is the number one place for that.

20:32.814 --> 20:37.237
You know, for Winter Comiket, Mari-chan was able to go and get us some stuff.

20:38.498 --> 20:43.823
We're hoping that Mori-chan can go again and get us with the... Ruffians!

20:44.003 --> 20:47.987
Please let us know what kind of circles are selling for.

20:48.007 --> 20:49.549
FUWAMOCO books.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.930
Advent books.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.032
We really want to get our paws on them.

20:53.172 --> 20:56.975
We need to make a list so we need it a bit earlier than that.

20:56.995 --> 20:57.196
Yeah.

20:58.161 --> 20:59.782
A little bit earlier than that, please.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.543
Yeah, a little bit earlier than last time, too.

21:02.643 --> 21:04.283
Good luck, Moni-chan!

21:04.383 --> 21:05.484
It's a battlefield!

21:05.504 --> 21:09.605
But you know, Ruffians, you know, last time there was Winter Comiket, right?

21:09.685 --> 21:12.066
But we had just sort of debuted.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.807
But everyone needed to apply.

21:14.547 --> 21:20.869
So, there wasn't... There was still lots of Advent and FUWAMOCO stuff, but it wasn't that much.

21:21.309 --> 21:21.610
Right?

21:23.614 --> 21:25.975
You know, we still got our hands on a lot of stuff.

21:26.455 --> 21:30.776
And I think on some stuff that the Ruffians don't even know about.

21:30.836 --> 21:33.177
Some very rare!

21:33.477 --> 21:33.777
Yeah.

21:34.137 --> 21:35.018
A bit rare, huh?

21:35.418 --> 21:37.619
Eye treasures!

21:37.679 --> 21:38.199
Eye treasures!

21:38.299 --> 21:40.179
Eye treasures!

21:40.480 --> 21:45.561
So let us know what other kind of rare treasures might be waiting that we don't know about yet.

21:45.881 --> 21:46.201
Yeah.

21:46.622 --> 21:46.862
Yeah.

21:47.382 --> 21:49.423
Oh, the mochi!

21:49.503 --> 21:49.803
Yeah!

21:49.903 --> 21:50.503
Breaking it.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.331
BAU BAU!

21:54.811 --> 21:55.472
BAU BAU!

21:55.572 --> 21:56.273
BAU BAU!

22:14.950 --> 22:15.410
Wow.

22:15.430 --> 22:21.032
I noticed, Ruffians, that there's been some silly things going on on Twitter.

22:21.392 --> 22:23.592
When are there not silly things going on on Twitter?

22:23.812 --> 22:24.092
Yeah.

22:24.232 --> 22:27.113
Let's take a look at this first one here.

22:29.574 --> 22:32.674
It seems like Moco-chan, you've been replaced.

22:33.115 --> 22:34.355
Wow.

22:36.028 --> 22:45.052
There's been some shady business going on, and there have been some people reselling merch from the big hololive City event going on.

22:45.812 --> 22:47.893
But this time, with a new angle.

22:49.503 --> 22:51.684
Look at this FUWAMOCO badge set!

22:52.144 --> 22:52.504
Huh?

22:53.024 --> 22:53.804
Ruffians!

22:54.785 --> 22:56.805
Does something look a little bit off?

22:57.486 --> 22:57.866
Huh?

22:58.646 --> 23:00.047
You see, Fuwawa, I'm there!

23:00.147 --> 23:01.187
I'm fluffy!

23:01.207 --> 23:02.327
I'm there, you know!

23:03.028 --> 23:06.569
Oh, somebody there next to me, they have dog ears.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.890
Up there, I'm blue.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.170
Moco-chan's pink.

23:11.270 --> 23:11.911
Yeah.

23:14.591 --> 23:15.832
I'm not Koyori!

23:16.492 --> 23:17.292
I'm Mococo!

23:20.079 --> 23:21.980
BAU BAU!

23:22.500 --> 23:26.261
It's Fuwa... Fuwakoyo!

23:26.281 --> 23:27.881
Fuwakoyo!

23:28.881 --> 23:30.362
Or you could be Mocoyo!

23:30.722 --> 23:32.702
Moco-chan, I'm Mocoyo!

23:33.142 --> 23:35.803
But that would just be me and Koyori-senpai.

23:36.383 --> 23:37.123
That's true.

23:37.143 --> 23:38.564
Fuwakoyo!

23:38.584 --> 23:38.844
BAU BAU!

23:43.705 --> 23:44.946
Goodbye, Moco-chan.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.287
Koyori-senpai is here!

23:46.307 --> 23:47.068
She's all ready!

23:47.088 --> 23:48.429
She's all ready!

23:48.709 --> 23:49.450
Bye, Moco-chan!

23:49.970 --> 23:53.573
Are you just gonna do FUWAMOCO Morning without me, with Koyori-senpai instead?

23:53.813 --> 23:55.374
Oh, it's possible.

23:56.295 --> 24:00.499
But good luck doing, uh... Asa... Asa Coco.

24:01.059 --> 24:01.399
What?

24:01.699 --> 24:02.320
No way!

24:02.360 --> 24:02.460
No.

24:05.502 --> 24:09.224
We're not switching.

24:09.965 --> 24:11.525
No switching, Moco-chan!

24:11.765 --> 24:13.867
You're forever going to FUWAMOCO!

24:14.467 --> 24:20.050
FUWAMOCO is FUWAMOCO because FUWA plus MOCO.

24:20.430 --> 24:21.891
FUWAMOCO!

24:21.951 --> 24:23.331
BAU BAU!

24:26.207 --> 24:26.568
Right.

24:26.608 --> 24:26.948
Right.

24:26.968 --> 24:29.672
BAU BAU!

24:29.772 --> 24:32.956
BAU BAU!

24:33.016 --> 24:34.738
No more silly business, okay?

24:34.758 --> 24:35.679
No more silly business!

24:35.759 --> 24:37.541
Moco-chan is Moco-chan.

24:38.042 --> 24:38.422
Yeah.

24:38.783 --> 24:39.804
She's the fuzzy one.

24:39.824 --> 24:40.705
Got it, Ruffian?

24:41.206 --> 24:41.586
Yeah.

24:43.808 --> 24:46.109
Silly Risa was hot!

24:46.169 --> 24:49.050
But I'm happy though because I love Koyari-senpai too!

24:49.170 --> 24:50.190
BAU BAU!

24:50.291 --> 24:54.092
BAU BAU!

24:54.412 --> 24:55.692
Well, Ruffians!

24:56.112 --> 24:59.354
The Twitter silly business continues here!

24:59.374 --> 24:59.934
Does it?

25:00.254 --> 25:00.554
It does!

25:00.654 --> 25:01.174
Does it?

25:01.294 --> 25:01.754
It does!

25:01.894 --> 25:05.096
Let me take a look, Moco-chan.

25:05.976 --> 25:06.556
Huh?

25:06.576 --> 25:09.177
Well, it seems like Ruffians

25:10.953 --> 25:11.893
Misutoo!

25:12.374 --> 25:15.515
They have a new pondering coming up!

25:15.735 --> 25:16.275
What?

25:16.535 --> 25:18.196
And it looks super duper delicious!

25:19.136 --> 25:23.758
Of course, naturally, FUWAMOCO, we have our eyes on it.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.639
But... What?

25:26.239 --> 25:31.982
There's also been a bunch of Ruffians who've been letting us know about the joyous news, too!

25:32.402 --> 25:33.823
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

25:33.843 --> 25:35.803
There's been a number of you, too!

25:35.884 --> 25:36.304
Right!

25:36.424 --> 25:39.105
Yeah, it looks super delicious, but...

25:41.331 --> 25:44.593
I've also been thinking of FUWAMOCO and you see ponderings!

25:45.093 --> 25:46.694
It makes me so happy!

25:47.014 --> 26:02.203
But, you know, on Twitter, when you search up FUWAMOCO, for some reason, Twitter now pushes all the tweets from the official Misuto Twitter account about ponderings to you.

26:02.304 --> 26:04.065
So you search up FUWAMOCO,

26:05.305 --> 26:06.626
That tweet come up too.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.167
It's not promoted or anything.

26:08.207 --> 26:08.887
It's not promoted.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.408
It's just Twitter's algorithm.

26:10.448 --> 26:10.808
Yeah.

26:11.168 --> 26:11.989
Twitter knows.

26:12.049 --> 26:15.451
Twitter knows how much FUWAMOCO loves porn right now.

26:15.471 --> 26:18.712
And at first, like, I noticed it and I was like, oh, that's silly.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.193
That's silly, but then- Thank you.

26:20.213 --> 26:22.735
There's been other Ruffians noticing this too.

26:25.026 --> 26:26.707
I don't know.

26:27.347 --> 26:34.208
But... It makes me happy to think that Twitter recognizes our love for pondering too!

26:34.328 --> 26:37.609
Yeah, we've been recognized!

26:38.329 --> 26:38.749
Yeah!

26:38.869 --> 26:40.490
Maybe one day, you know?

26:40.510 --> 26:43.150
That would be nice.

26:43.190 --> 26:45.751
But for now, we'll continue to love pondering!

26:45.811 --> 26:50.772
We're excited to go try the new pondering once it's released!

26:50.792 --> 26:53.953
Oh my gosh, I wonder how juicy and tender it'll be.

26:54.953 --> 26:57.874
Delicious it's gonna be.

26:58.174 --> 27:00.014
Soft, very soft.

27:00.454 --> 27:01.175
Very soft.

27:01.595 --> 27:04.315
BAU BAU!

27:04.715 --> 27:09.176
I wonder if they'll ever make a more delicious pondering than the pondering's already existing.

27:09.196 --> 27:10.397
It's not possible.

27:10.937 --> 27:11.617
I don't know.

27:12.317 --> 27:14.018
BAU BAU!

27:14.238 --> 27:15.058
Live up for you!

27:15.758 --> 27:18.459
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day today!

27:18.499 --> 27:21.061
The Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

27:21.301 --> 27:22.442
GARY!

27:22.902 --> 27:29.605
GARY IS THE Doggie of the Day!

27:30.446 --> 27:30.646
GARY!

27:30.666 --> 27:33.207
That's a very delicious tail you have up there.

27:33.768 --> 27:37.610
It's just a normal doggy tail, that's all, you know.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.191
Normal brown colored doggy.

27:40.211 --> 27:42.012
Floppy ears.

27:42.252 --> 27:43.353
Right, right.

27:43.713 --> 27:44.854
Somehow the ties look really enticing, huh?

27:44.874 --> 27:46.515
Every doggy ties look enticing, right Moco-chan?

27:46.535 --> 27:48.936
Something about these ones look more enticing.

27:48.956 --> 27:51.238
I don't know, maybe, maybe, you know, maybe it's just a funny morning.

27:51.258 --> 27:53.019
Maybe we're feeling a little funnier than usual, Moco-chan.

27:54.520 --> 27:54.860
I wanna hear it!

27:54.880 --> 27:55.481
I wanna hear it!

27:55.501 --> 27:56.061
I wanna hear it!

27:56.081 --> 27:56.681
I wanna hear it!

27:56.701 --> 27:57.282
I wanna hear it!

27:57.302 --> 27:57.722
I wanna hear it!

27:57.742 --> 27:58.262
I wanna hear it!

27:58.282 --> 27:58.602
I wanna hear it!

27:58.622 --> 27:59.023
I wanna hear it!

27:59.043 --> 27:59.483
I wanna hear it!

27:59.503 --> 27:59.843
I wanna hear it!

27:59.863 --> 28:00.284
I wanna hear it!

28:00.304 --> 28:00.764
I wanna hear it!

28:01.424 --> 28:01.925
I wanna hear it!

28:01.945 --> 28:02.285
I wanna hear it!

28:02.305 --> 28:02.625
I wanna hear it!

28:02.645 --> 28:03.105
I wanna hear it!

28:03.125 --> 28:03.946
I wanna hear it!

28:03.966 --> 28:04.286
I wanna hear it!

28:04.326 --> 28:04.686
I wanna hear it!

28:04.706 --> 28:05.027
I wanna hear it!

28:05.047 --> 28:05.427
I wanna hear it!

28:05.447 --> 28:05.767
I wanna hear it!

28:05.787 --> 28:06.427
I wanna hear it!

28:06.447 --> 28:07.688
I wanna hear it!

28:07.708 --> 28:08.008
I wanna hear it!

28:08.028 --> 28:08.329
I wanna hear it!

28:08.349 --> 28:08.649
I wanna hear it!

28:08.669 --> 28:09.049
I wanna hear it!

28:09.069 --> 28:09.529
I wanna hear it!

28:09.549 --> 28:10.430
I wanna hear it

28:11.020 --> 28:12.181
That was scary, BAU BAU.

28:12.201 --> 28:14.443
I have a feeling it's a very unique BAU BAU.

28:14.823 --> 28:14.983
Oh?

28:15.604 --> 28:25.292
Kinda like... Like that!

28:25.352 --> 28:27.133
Like that!

28:27.333 --> 28:29.155
Kinda sounds like a BAU BAU.

28:29.635 --> 28:31.076
It's a very unique BAU BAU.

28:31.096 --> 28:32.978
Very unique, right?

28:33.498 --> 28:37.622
Game, why are you making that face?! !

28:40.138 --> 28:41.939
You look sort of uncomfortable.

28:42.660 --> 28:43.301
And I like it.

28:43.421 --> 28:46.244
I like it!

28:46.925 --> 28:47.766
Very cute.

28:48.046 --> 28:49.067
Very cute.

28:49.347 --> 28:52.331
BAU BAU, Kirari.

28:55.114 --> 28:55.514
BAU BAU!

28:59.515 --> 29:02.318
I wanna see more pictures of the doggy.

29:02.578 --> 29:03.619
Very interesting doggy.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.240
BAU BAU!

29:04.740 --> 29:07.203
The stripes are enticing too there.

29:07.603 --> 29:09.165
The chin there enticing too.

29:09.185 --> 29:11.067
The little pink on those there.

29:11.147 --> 29:11.888
BAU BAU!

29:11.948 --> 29:13.169
BAU BAU!

29:13.910 --> 29:16.392
Very tasty dog.

29:19.255 --> 29:22.057
BAU BAU!

29:22.077 --> 29:26.200
Let's see Ruffians, have you been going on any nice summertime walks?

29:26.220 --> 29:26.760
Yeah!

29:26.820 --> 29:28.081
We have de-den!

29:28.221 --> 29:30.403
Oh my gosh!

29:30.423 --> 29:31.183
A full walk!

29:34.145 --> 29:36.806
You got the whole gang with you!

29:36.886 --> 29:37.886
BAU BAU!

29:37.966 --> 29:38.906
Ruffians!

29:39.066 --> 29:39.186
Us!

29:39.306 --> 29:41.767
Super cute!

29:41.787 --> 29:43.748
They just look like doggies in a can.

29:43.868 --> 29:44.788
BAU BAU!

29:44.828 --> 29:45.888
They're so so happy!

29:46.388 --> 29:52.670
And the scenery looks so nice and green.

29:52.710 --> 29:54.351
Very luscious.

29:55.051 --> 29:56.951
Very nice summertime look.

29:57.051 --> 30:00.472
Thank you for taking us all together with you!

30:01.052 --> 30:02.893
BAU BAU!

30:04.420 --> 30:06.723
Next, we have our Question of the Day.

30:07.023 --> 30:10.447
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

30:10.867 --> 30:12.329
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

30:12.369 --> 30:16.534
When you receive doujinshi or other pieces of family... Receive.

30:16.974 --> 30:17.355
Receive?

30:17.375 --> 30:19.237
That's what I said.

30:19.787 --> 30:20.027
BAU BAU!

30:38.423 --> 30:41.204
How fluffy and fuzzy are we to you, you know?

30:41.945 --> 30:52.209
But, you know, of course we're also really interested in everyone's thoughts and interpretation, but we're also really happy when we're portrayed really close to how we are here!

30:52.289 --> 30:56.310
Yeah, that means you're watching closely, too.

30:57.031 --> 31:04.074
You know, I feel like sometimes it's a little bit like, when things are kind of changed, you know?

31:06.303 --> 31:10.305
Especially, you know, in the case of Moco-chan from L.A.

31:10.385 --> 31:15.287
You know, I'm fuzzy, not fluffy, okay?

31:15.387 --> 31:16.627
I'm Mococo!

31:16.988 --> 31:17.468
What is?

31:17.948 --> 31:28.613
If it looks too different from how we are regularly, you know, it kind of starts to feel like a cosplay instead of us, so we kind of feel like, aww, okay.

31:30.138 --> 31:37.440
Yeah, and you know, if Fuwawa says stuff like Mococo instead of Moco-chan, you know, it sort of takes us off from the world building too high.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.260
Mococo!

31:38.300 --> 31:39.361
Don't go that way!

31:39.381 --> 31:40.241
It's not right.

31:40.361 --> 31:41.662
It's not right.

31:41.722 --> 31:42.802
It should be Moco-chan.

31:43.142 --> 31:43.942
Yeah.

31:44.222 --> 31:48.504
If we don't BAU BAU, then something's really wrong!

31:49.024 --> 31:49.404
Yeah.

31:49.584 --> 31:52.725
But we really like serious moments!

31:52.745 --> 31:56.786
Please tell us how you like this year's Ruffians, okay?

31:57.006 --> 31:59.167
BAU BAU!

31:59.847 --> 32:03.669
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

32:03.709 --> 32:06.050
We're always looking for more questions!

32:06.351 --> 32:07.471
Doggy of the days!

32:07.851 --> 32:10.973
Your walks, pero sightings, all of it!

32:11.033 --> 32:16.176
So please let us know with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

32:16.476 --> 32:18.217
BAU BAU!

32:18.357 --> 32:22.459
As for our next stream, we have De-den!

32:22.679 --> 32:26.521
We'll be meeting Super Chats and chatting with a bunch of Ruffians!

32:26.641 --> 32:27.242
It's gonna be

32:28.064 --> 32:32.667
Probably a good time chatting all together.

32:32.687 --> 32:39.412
There's been a bunch of exciting things so we want to be able to talk but I still feel like we haven't been able to reminisce enough.

32:41.784 --> 32:45.586
Last time was pretty silly, I think this time's gonna be even more silly.

32:45.626 --> 32:46.206
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:46.266 --> 32:49.148
So, please join us, Ruffians!

32:49.588 --> 32:52.049
And let's take a look at our schedule this week.

32:52.129 --> 32:52.950
Our schedule!

32:52.970 --> 32:54.871
3D week schedule!

32:54.951 --> 32:55.391
Yeah!

32:55.711 --> 32:59.273
And on Tuesday, we're also gonna be playing Sakura Wars 5!

32:59.573 --> 33:01.134
It's been a little while!

33:01.194 --> 33:02.995
But we need to get ready for New York City.

33:03.015 --> 33:03.455
We do!

33:03.475 --> 33:07.437
We have breaking dimensions in New York City, so we'll have to see if they have birds.

33:08.077 --> 33:08.377
Yep.

33:08.818 --> 33:12.020
So we're gonna go back to Summer Voice 5 and get all adjusted to New York.

33:12.240 --> 33:12.340
Yes!

33:12.380 --> 33:15.203
Then we'll be all ready at the end of this month.

33:15.583 --> 33:18.565
And then on Wednesday we have FUWAMOCO Morning and Portal 2!

33:18.605 --> 33:22.708
We're finally playing Portal 2 for the first time on Thursday.

33:22.729 --> 33:23.969
I don't know why this is here.

33:24.810 --> 33:25.771
It's Pero's birthday.

33:27.012 --> 33:28.033
I guess it's gonna be a party.

33:29.591 --> 33:37.057
Friday we have Nerissa's 3D debut at 8pm PT.

33:37.297 --> 33:42.021
And then on Saturday, it's our 3D debut!

33:42.621 --> 33:44.883
Please be there, Ruffians!

33:45.323 --> 33:47.525
And on Sunday, we have a lot to do.

33:47.545 --> 33:52.566
Let's talk about because it's going to be our 3D debut after party!

33:52.586 --> 33:53.787
Please be there.

33:53.807 --> 33:56.107
There's so much we're going to want to talk about.

33:56.167 --> 34:01.348
You want to be there for our 3D debut, of course, but also our after party.

34:01.388 --> 34:01.688
BAU BAU!

34:01.728 --> 34:05.569
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:05.629 --> 34:12.791
Ruffians who are joining us through the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO with... It's BAU BAU 3D!

34:12.871 --> 34:13.411
BAU BAU!

34:17.646 --> 34:27.132
Thank you so so much, Ruffians, for joining us today, the very beginning of our 3D week, and for joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:27.392 --> 34:33.215
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

34:33.756 --> 34:36.357
Toshiro Iwai!

34:37.318 --> 34:39.099
BAU BAU!

34:39.639 --> 34:40.580
Nekiso Jedon!

34:40.880 --> 34:42.161

34:42.381 --> 34:43.361
Heart Crayon!

34:43.682 --> 34:44.362
BAU BAU!

34:44.902 --> 34:55.224
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

34:55.524 --> 35:00.505
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:14.529 --> 35:15.016
BAU BAU!
