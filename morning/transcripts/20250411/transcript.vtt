00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.737
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:24.217 --> 00:05:27.061
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:32.067
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:33.889

Good morning!

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.092
Friday!

00:05:36.392 --> 00:05:38.014
It's Friday.

00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:39.176
It's your week!

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:43.802

00:05:44.342 --> 00:05:46.025
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:47.186
Ruffians!

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.788
Can you believe it?

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.312
Today is our 146th episode!

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:59.722
Thank you for joining us on the showcase of BAU BAU!

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:01.484
Good morning!

00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:03.066
Good morning first time viewers!

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.248
Oh, maybe not.

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:07.371
You sleep in.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:08.692
But today you're awake.

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:11.915
Yeah, I did hear crows on the ground.

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.717
Yeah, I saw that.

00:06:14.098 --> 00:06:16.400
You thought this was the fourth episode.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.184
Well, you would be mistaken, huh?

00:06:20.284 --> 00:06:20.725
Not quite.

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:21.926
A hundred times.

00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:23.588
No.

00:06:23.608 --> 00:06:24.489
Yeah.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.869
No.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.571
A hundred times maybe.

00:06:27.392 --> 00:06:28.113
A bit more.

00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:29.374
I said not quite.

00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:36.606
But for Ruffians that are joining us for the first time and other Ruffians that are like, what is this?

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:43.256
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:44.418 --> 00:06:44.859
A.K.A.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:45.179
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:49.245
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:51.489
I said it twice, okay?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.113
Don't get confused, okay?

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:55.808
I'm confused now.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:02.899
Well, our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:03.039
Yeah!

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:04.761
Please say a thought to the hashtag.

00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:07.886
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:12.793

BAU BAU!

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.261
You ready?

00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:20.822
Ready for Friday?

00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:21.503
Yeah.

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:26.048
You know, I have a good feeling about today.

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.211
How do you feel, Rolfie?

00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:28.892
Do you feel good?

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:31.295
Misunderstanding.

00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:31.715
What do you want?

00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:33.077
No misunderstanding.

00:07:33.577 --> 00:07:35.540
It's Friday!

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.080
Friday?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.441
Yeah.

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:37.602
You ready?

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:37.742
Ready!

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:38.703
Sleepy.

00:07:38.723 --> 00:07:41.987
It was rough, rough.

00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:43.785
Not so good of a sleep.

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:45.009
Ruffians.

00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:48.139
It's morning okay!

00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:50.526
I know you're sleepy!

00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:53.074
But you have to wake up.

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:54.928
Okay, okay.

00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:59.294
And we're here to bring some pup into your day.

00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:02.077
Let's get going.

00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:03.900
Now for some more bad news.

00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:06.483
More bad news, Moco-chan?

00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:10.148
That implies that you know FUWAMOCO's bad news.

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:13.493
I was implying that waking up is bad news.

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:15.747
Thanks goodness.

00:08:16.348 --> 00:08:19.312
You know?

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.213
That was dark.

00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:24.979
Wow!

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:25.280
Pero Sighting!

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.540
Wow!

00:08:27.022 --> 00:08:31.468
Where was Pero Sighting?

00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:39.699
Let's take a look.

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.062
Someone looks comfy there, huh?

00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:43.384
Melty.

00:08:45.268 --> 00:08:48.095
And sort of a cute one, but nasty, huh?

00:08:48.115 --> 00:08:48.576
Yeah.

00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:52.104
And what's with the fangs, huh?

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.933
Help, help.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:56.890
Hi!

00:08:57.651 --> 00:08:59.072
It should've been me!

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:00.074
Hi!

00:09:00.094 --> 00:09:01.215
Let me be there!

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:01.455
Ruffians!

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:05.580
You wouldn't be like that if you sat on Mari-senchou-senpai's lap.

00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:06.762
Right?

00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:09.645
Why are you sitting on Senchou-senpai's lap?

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:11.467
Hi!

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:11.768
Hi!

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:13.029
What?

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.111
Should've been you!

00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.191
Hi!

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:23.322
Last time I said this was FUWAMOCO Morning and not

00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:25.957
Morning senchou morning.

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:28.860
Let's all say ahoy!

00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:31.923
Not bad, no?

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:33.906
Senchou-senpai morning.

00:09:33.966 --> 00:09:37.470
No.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.570
Hmm.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.711
Ha?

00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:39.952
Moco-chan, you gonna be?

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.055
Oh, Ruffians.

00:09:43.196 --> 00:09:44.538
Ruffians!

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:49.624
Are you Ruffians or are you ichimi, ha?

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:49.924
Ha!

00:09:50.144 --> 00:09:52.667
Maybe everyone's confused, ha?

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:57.262
Look what you've done.

00:09:57.785 --> 00:09:59.940
Look what you've done.

00:10:03.717 --> 00:10:06.320
Because you know, Senchou-senpai is pretty, pretty wonderful.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.884
I could talk about her lots and lots, but this is FUWAMOCO morning, right?

00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:11.465
Yeah.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:15.709
And you know, I think this is inappropriate, Ruffians, you know.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:27.562
You know, if Pero's tired from flopping his little wings around and doing damn dog things, you know, Senchou-senpai's lap is not the place to take a rest.

00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:27.802
Okay?

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:29.283
It's not a place for a rest.

00:10:29.343 --> 00:10:29.944
No.

00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:30.905
Yeah, FUWAMOCO.

00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:33.188
Better place would be the garbage can.

00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:33.629
Yeah.

00:10:33.849 --> 00:10:38.475
No, uh... Trash compactor!

00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:38.815
Trash compactor!

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:40.657
That's a step up from a garbage can!

00:10:40.677 --> 00:10:43.581
Those kind of things, yeah.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:47.085
Don't take a rest in the trash compactor, okay, Ruffians?

00:10:47.225 --> 00:10:51.671
Even if... Can't stop talking, I will send you someplace fine.

00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:57.298
Even then, I wouldn't want you to take a rest in the trash compactor, okay?

00:10:57.418 --> 00:10:57.518
Yeah.

00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:02.865
Well, I guess we're just going to have to do some... Even Gaido got it.

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:07.294
Even in this case, I wouldn't want you going there!

00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:15.692
BAU BAU.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.297
It's Friday, Ruffians!

00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:19.158
It's a good day!

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:21.662
No trash compactors today, okay?

00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:26.570
BAU BAU!

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.433
It's the Ruffians!

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:32.820
I know we share this with you lots and lots and you know, you probably know that

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.383
How we feelin' and everything.

00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:36.045
But we wanna say it again!

00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:40.112
Ruffians, thank you!

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:40.452
Thank you!

00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:41.714
Cuz you know, there's a reason.

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:42.295
A reason.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.637
There's supposed to come a reason.

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:47.724
We don't need a reason to say thank you normally, but this time there is another one.

00:11:47.744 --> 00:11:48.144
We do!

00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:49.346
Yeah!

00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:57.880
I covered a Let Me Be With You by Rod Taylor B. Newton from the anime Tobit has hit over 1 million views on YouTube!

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.684
BAU BAU!

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:03.146
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:03.746
Did you get all that?

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:06.249
Those played a multiple, Moco-chan.

00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.834
I played a bit of a multiple, hi.

00:12:10.854 --> 00:12:11.955
BAU BAU!

00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:14.177
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:16.680
Yeah, we're so surprised and super happy that you like it so much!

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.686
You know, since it's a song that we've loved for many years and it means a lot to us.

00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:26.550
But I... You know, we didn't really think that maybe...

00:12:26.969 --> 00:12:30.330
It will be very well known that I am a-

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:34.966
It's a little bit old.

00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:40.694
Thank you for listening to it lots and lots!

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:41.695
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.558
I love FUWAMOCO so much, too!

00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:44.919
FUWAMOCO is good, too!

00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:47.563
Definitely, it's a song that's unforgettable.

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:52.309
If you haven't heard it yet, you know?

00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:52.810
Please check it out!

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.851
It's really, really cute!

00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:55.854
It will get stuck in your head for sure, too.

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:59.920
You know, you'll be like... All the time.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.802
But yeah, like Moco-chan said, you know, it's a...

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:09.010
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.093
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:31.333
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:31.313 --> 00:13:31.994
Okay.

00:13:32.815 --> 00:13:34.238
Can I hold you tonight?

00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:38.003
BAU BAU!

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:42.270
BAU BAU!

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.711
Ruffians!

00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:46.617
You know Biboo, right?

00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:50.082
You know the sparkling gem of Advent.

00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:51.344
Yes, hololive English -Advent-.

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:54.870
Yeah, you know also criminally clumsy.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:54.990
Yeah.

00:13:59.317 --> 00:13:59.397
Wow.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.556
Yay!

00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:03.546
She went on a trip.

00:14:04.309 --> 00:14:05.354
Biboo went on a trip!

00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:06.499
Yeah.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:09.252
And I... See I...

00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:14.582
She fell off an escalator three steps.

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:18.407
I had quite the tumble.

00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:19.629
Quite the tumble, yeah.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.693
I could see no Ruffians!

00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:25.657
We're gonna be seeing Biboo!

00:14:25.677 --> 00:14:32.627
You know when Biboo was like... We know we heard that she fell.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.070
We have to go get her some band-aids!

00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:36.633
I don't wanna get band-aids!

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.916
Why is Biboo not carrying band-aids around with her all the time?

00:14:38.936 --> 00:14:39.897
I think she would know by now.

00:14:40.636 --> 00:14:41.657
Yeah, but.

00:14:41.717 --> 00:14:42.398
Now she is.

00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:45.140
Now she will be.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.982
But you know, we got her band-aids.

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:47.842
Yeah.

00:14:47.863 --> 00:14:50.105
But then we, you know, we're like, okay, let's take a look.

00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:55.329
She was a lot more scratched up than we expected.

00:14:55.349 --> 00:14:59.853
Yeah, she had some, some, uh, cracks going on and everything.

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:01.295
Yeah.

00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:02.636
A rolling stone.

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.758
Babies on the knees.

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:07.800
A rolling, tumbling, falling, cracking, crashing.

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.643
It wasn't that bad.

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:12.585
We were just surprised as well.

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:18.593
Yeah, but you know, I think we did a pretty good job at patching her as much as patching her up.

00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:20.816
Guide dogs should carry them as well.

00:15:21.477 --> 00:15:27.464
Actually, I was thinking about, because I have a tiny, tiny medical kit.

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:34.153
I was thinking about putting that in my bag the other day and I thought... How many times?

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:36.896
When was the last time I even used a band-aid?

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:37.397
Right.

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:39.820
Apparently.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.911
Yeah.

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:44.273
Apparently not for me.

00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:46.136
Does she need to go to the clinic?

00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:48.679
Oh no no, Biboo's fine.

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:49.820
She didn't go to the hospital.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.601
No.

00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:51.462
FUWAMOCO, you know.

00:15:51.482 --> 00:15:52.223
We're just surprised.

00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:56.889
We're not quite doctors, but we're pretty doctors.

00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:57.009
Yeah.

00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:58.170
Yeah.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.515
You know, but she's doing much better now, so no worries.

00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:07.461
But definitely need to keep a close eye on her.

00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:08.082
Yeah.

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:08.743
No.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.952
FUWAMOCO Why?

00:16:12.212 --> 00:16:13.555
FUWAMOCO We're talking to Mane-chan!

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:16.681
FUWAMOCO And she said, FUWAMOCO Biboo!

00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:20.969
FUWAMOCO Biboo fell off the elevator!

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:24.235
FUWAMOCO And Mane-chan was like, FUWAMOCO Huh?

00:16:26.273 --> 00:16:27.354
Yeah.

00:16:27.374 --> 00:16:31.079
You know we gotta keep an eye on her.

00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:36.465
Otherwise next time she'll be going from the escalator to the elevator.

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:37.126
The elevator!

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:40.109
She'll be crashing right through.

00:16:40.169 --> 00:16:45.175
Not the elevator, it was the escalator.

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:45.656
Okay?

00:16:46.377 --> 00:16:46.857
Yeah.

00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:50.441
But you know we did catch her again almost.

00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:51.903
Almost falling, so.

00:16:51.943 --> 00:16:53.665
I was rough.

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:57.089
But yeah, we got to hang out with Biboo a bit!

00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:06.539
You know, I think recently doing a collab with Subaru-senpai, we kind of mentioned that, you know, we've been doing head spas.

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:17.090
Head spas recently, so you know, we thought, well, let's go together with Biboo this time!

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.931
Biboo and Toe with us!

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:18.872
Yeah.

00:17:20.234 --> 00:17:22.037
But it was a lot of fun.

00:17:22.237 --> 00:17:22.958
Yeah.

00:17:22.978 --> 00:17:27.685
I know, that's all it is.

00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:30.369
They're always super cute and kind and they whisper.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.753
And I'm not too strong.

00:17:32.773 --> 00:17:35.717
This time, it was pretty strong.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.402
It's pretty strong, yeah.

00:17:38.803 --> 00:17:40.404
I don't know how she does it.

00:17:41.045 --> 00:17:42.527
Her strength's so long, you know?

00:17:42.547 --> 00:17:46.731
I was like at the beginning, I'm like, oh it's kind of strong, but she'll get tired, you know?

00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:50.776
Her grip strength, it can't last this much for that long.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:51.937
Oh no.

00:17:51.977 --> 00:18:00.166
Yeah, and you know, it's nice because they're kind and careful enough to not hurt you.

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:02.869
Yeah, you don't have to be bothered by that.

00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:25.718
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:27.649
Hi!

00:18:29.193 --> 00:18:31.118
It's a fuzzy Moco-chan!

00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:38.779
Right now it's hard like a rock, but now it feels fuzzy!

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:41.324
Oh, I'm so fluffy!

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.328
Yeah.

00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:46.857
But it was very, very strong.

00:18:46.977 --> 00:18:47.779
I was impressed.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:51.989
Even Biboo, Biboo was like, I was like, oh, I'm like, yeah, I was impressed.

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:54.815
Sometimes you have to take deep breaths.

00:18:57.562 --> 00:18:57.662
Okay!

00:18:57.642 --> 00:19:07.064
But it was nice that we had fun together!

00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:09.069
Thank you Biboo for coming with us!

She's also at Holo Explore.

00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:36.594
But there's some more information!

00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:44.561
Advent will be having a special pop-up store in Shibuya Tsutaya!

00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:44.902
BAU BAU!

00:19:44.982 --> 00:19:48.365

00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:51.668
Look at all these beautiful cute illustrations here!

00:19:51.688 --> 00:19:55.211
But you know, if you're wondering what's Shibuya Tsutaya, how do I get there?

00:19:55.232 --> 00:19:57.674
Well, first you have to come to Japan.

00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:58.935
That's a bit of a big trip.

00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:04.182
But, if you go to the famous Shibuya Scramble, it's right there!

00:20:04.382 --> 00:20:07.366
Right at the Shibuya Scramble!

00:20:07.687 --> 00:20:14.816
And it will be starting on April 25th and will go until May 29th, so about a month long!

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.383
Ruffians!

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:27.032

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.256
No, you like my outfit.

00:21:02.277 --> 00:21:03.901
It's very pretty.

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:05.546
It's very nice.

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.010
Why are you laughing?

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:08.234
It's very nice.

00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:10.300
LMAO.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.504
What does that mean?

00:21:11.524 --> 00:21:13.169
It's very nice.

00:21:14.091 --> 00:21:14.653
Why are you laughing?

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:25.617
It's the morning!

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:45.315
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, not FUWAMOCO Pool Time!

00:21:45.295 --> 00:21:54.088
Clouds is part of iGrid, which is a combined figure brand together with Design Coco and IP Shoten.

00:21:54.469 --> 00:21:59.316
And it's a part of the Vape Fruits Project.

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.157
Vape Fruits Project here in Aomori!

00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:06.206
It'll be goods on sale as well as FUWAMOCO figure pre-orders and exhibition at the venues!

00:22:06.386 --> 00:22:08.710
Figure pre-orders!

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:14.138
I wonder maybe our new business figures could be in.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:42.859

Off the seat.

00:22:44.281 --> 00:22:46.416
You like Biboo's big sleeves the best.

00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:47.685

You can take the left side.

00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:19.233
I'll take the right side.

00:23:19.334 --> 00:23:21.117
Excuse me.

00:23:21.137 --> 00:23:23.122
I'm using my jacket right now.

00:23:23.162 --> 00:23:26.168
They are elastics but it's really cool.

00:23:26.188 --> 00:23:26.829
It's nothing new.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.459
Nerissa having elastics is not new.

00:23:31.439 --> 00:23:38.570
But you know, Ruffians, I'm sure there'll be even more details coming out soon.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.958
Maybe the next few days or so.

00:23:43.978 --> 00:23:46.141
But it's very exciting!

00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:48.925
Advent's pumped for the show!

00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:50.587
Advent only!

00:23:50.607 --> 00:23:53.372

Very excited.

Now we can bully Nerissa really well, right?

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:56.239
Right!

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.000
She looks so tidy!

There's a lot of possibilities, Ruffians, so you know.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.236
Maybe you've never touched an MMD yet.

00:25:27.616 --> 00:25:29.440
Now is your chance!

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.422

We're looking forward to all your creative works, FUWAMOCO!

We like to push our excitement with you.

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:13.720
Yeah, if you go, and you get two of the gummies and part of the campaign, you know, there's a strawberry.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:28.907
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:27:28.887 --> 00:27:33.211
The energy drink flavor too, and I think melon soda as well.

00:27:33.712 --> 00:27:39.277
If you get any of those following gummies to a dog, then you can get your own clear file.

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:43.342
And you know, these gummies, they're different than the rest of the gummies.

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:45.484
They are very chewy.

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:47.245
They're super gummies, you know.

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:48.206
I like them.

00:27:48.527 --> 00:27:52.691
I don't know about you, Ruffians, but I like a gummy that you can chew on.

00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:54.793
Yeah, you know, you get

00:27:55.482 --> 00:28:00.497
FUWAMOCO

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.836
You can chew this one and over and over and over and over and over.

00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:07.398
You get a clear file at random?

00:28:07.758 --> 00:28:10.662
No, you get to chew it.

00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:17.010
But you know you're gonna have to be like... It's a hard choice sometimes.

00:28:17.591 --> 00:28:22.717
Sometimes you know you're just gonna have to eat a lot of gummies and you know it.

00:28:22.737 --> 00:28:25.981
If you want all the clear files, you know what?

00:28:26.001 --> 00:28:29.185
That's six clear files plus twelve gummy packs.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.099
That's a lot of gummies.

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:33.825
But who doesn't like gummies, you know?

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:37.990
Right, and you can think of, you know, how can I eat this?

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:38.651
Eat this gummy.

00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:42.034
You can just, you know, maybe you can put it in hidden places.

00:28:42.094 --> 00:28:44.256
Yeah, you can take it off to the challenge, yeah!

00:28:44.836 --> 00:28:46.398
You know, maybe you have a lot of jackets.

00:28:46.718 --> 00:28:50.041
You can be like, I'm gonna put some gummies in this jacket pocket.

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:51.502
So when you forget, there's gummies.

00:28:51.522 --> 00:28:55.046
This bag, you know, maybe you have a car, you can put it into your car.

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:57.348
You know, so you can be surrounded by gummies.

00:28:57.648 --> 00:28:59.310
Whenever you know you kind of maybe need.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.190
Whenever you forget.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.712
So happy gummies.

00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:04.234
Or you can give them to your friends.

00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:06.377
Share the happiness!

00:29:06.397 --> 00:29:12.446
If you need even more happiness, there's also acrylic standees!

00:29:12.466 --> 00:29:14.069
And acrylic keychains!

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.956
Wow, just starting on April 8th!

00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:25.186
At selected FUWAMIMO locations, you can also get acrylic standees!

00:29:25.206 --> 00:29:27.128
And acrylic keychains!

00:29:27.148 --> 00:29:30.373
Acrylic keychains are random, so good luck, Ruffians!

00:29:30.494 --> 00:29:32.837
Good luck, whether it's acrylic standees or not.

00:29:32.817 --> 00:29:38.842
But, well you'll have to get your paws on them soon because they're gone.

00:29:39.383 --> 00:29:39.743
They're gone.

00:29:40.744 --> 00:29:41.945
That's it.

00:29:41.965 --> 00:29:43.687
That's it.

00:29:45.468 --> 00:29:51.174
And the vote, the clear file campaign still continues until April 14th.

00:29:51.874 --> 00:29:56.438
So Ruffians, we hope that you haven't headed to FUWAMIMO yet.

00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:58.160
Hopefully you can head over there.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.824
Get your paws on a whole EN clear file.

00:30:02.804 --> 00:30:09.895
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:15.764
Is this more waitress or maid?

00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:16.886
Good question.

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:25.740
I feel like it's diner or waitress.

00:30:26.716 --> 00:30:28.218
No percentage maid.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:29.339
Huh?

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:31.062
Waitress, waitress, waitress both?

00:30:31.943 --> 00:30:32.003

Ah.

00:30:55.314 --> 00:30:55.474
Waitress

00:30:56.551 --> 00:30:58.193
Maid Waitress Diner.

00:30:59.756 --> 00:31:00.897
We became a diner?

00:31:02.139 --> 00:31:03.020
I don't know!

00:31:04.623 --> 00:31:07.527
Okay!

00:31:07.547 --> 00:31:07.947
But it's super cute!

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:10.411
I love our matching outfits too!

00:31:11.192 --> 00:31:11.713
Thank you.

00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:12.834
And the band-aids!

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:17.862
Sometimes you know, we're not the best at role listening.

00:31:17.882 --> 00:31:19.224
Band-aids are cute!

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:19.504
I'm a cutie.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:36.514
BAU BAU!

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:54.115
FUWAMOCO has 4 FUWAMOCOs!

00:31:54.095 --> 00:31:58.543
I'm a little tired.

00:31:58.963 --> 00:32:01.367
My jaw is tired.

00:32:01.407 --> 00:32:09.962
There may be Ruffians who are worried about that.

00:32:10.403 --> 00:32:16.052
Share happiness with your friends.

00:32:16.454 --> 00:32:23.063
For example, if you have a lot of jackets, you can hide them in your pocket.

00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:33.658
When you're feeling down, Gumi will be by your side, so you can say, yes, okay!

00:32:33.698 --> 00:32:35.300
Oh, there's Gumi here!

00:32:35.661 --> 00:32:41.769
Also, FUWAMOCO's recommended flavors are, of course, the Lovely flavor and Moco-chan's Cola flavor.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:42.310
Also,

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.692
Ichigo.

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:44.413
Ichigo oishii.

00:32:44.433 --> 00:32:47.176
Hard cola desu ne.

00:32:47.196 --> 00:32:48.237
Cola oishii!

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.440
Soshite!

00:32:50.680 --> 00:33:03.235
Yoka kara hajimarimashita kedo, FOMIMA no tampo de, Akustar to Akuki mo kaemasu yo!

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:04.436
Yoka yoka.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:06.438
Hachi kara!

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:08.540

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:09.660

Eeeh!

00:33:24.573 --> 00:33:25.314
Kote no mise ni ikanai to!

00:33:25.354 --> 00:33:25.454

00:33:25.474 --> 00:33:30.338
De, eto, homepage no hou mitetara, naka, kou iu tenpo arimasu yo, te.

00:33:30.358 --> 00:33:31.639
Ichiran arimasu!

00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:32.580
Uuun, naka,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:44.400
There are a lot of good hints, so please take a look over there as well!

00:33:44.681 --> 00:33:57.443
It's a really delicious gummy, and FUWAMOCO is the type to chew a lot, so if you chew a lot, you'll be able to enjoy it even more, so please try it!

00:33:57.463 --> 00:33:57.623
BAU BAU!

00:33:59.459 --> 00:34:05.100
It's sad that you know it's going to be ending on the 14th but we hope that you can go soon.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.107
Hopefully you can enjoy the gummies along.

00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:09.396
With the remains of spring.

00:34:09.877 --> 00:34:15.968
You know, maybe you can take the acrylic stands with you, you know, on your adventures.

00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:18.913
Maybe there's still some cherry blossoms, some sakura blossoms.

00:34:19.374 --> 00:34:22.319
You can enjoy them together with all your sisters.

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:23.862
And your gummies too.

00:34:24.483 --> 00:34:27.067
BAU BAU!

00:34:27.088 --> 00:34:28.169
I'm just so happy, you know.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.255
This means, you know, so many Ruffians can

00:34:31.572 --> 00:34:48.176
I think it's time to see who's Doggie of the Day is today!

00:34:49.117 --> 00:34:53.243
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:34:53.223 --> 00:34:55.585
Many doggies!

00:34:55.605 --> 00:34:58.968
See you there!

00:34:58.988 --> 00:34:59.248
Bye-bye!

00:34:59.268 --> 00:35:00.970
It's a full game!

00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:02.171
Bye-bye!

00:35:02.191 --> 00:35:03.012
And look, they're also cute!

00:35:03.032 --> 00:35:05.074
And from the left, we have Clyde.

00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:12.020
And then, in the middle... Ken-Ken... Ken-no-bear, Ken-no-bee.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:12.901
Ken-no-bear.

00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:15.783
And on the right, Ko-Kobe-Kobe.

00:35:16.784 --> 00:35:20.308
So happy to spend a thousand dollars!

00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:21.389
Which one is it?

00:35:21.409 --> 00:35:22.029
Which one is it open?

00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:23.010
Ken-no-bear.

00:35:23.648 --> 00:35:24.569
Konobi.

00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:27.733
Konobi!

00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:28.875
Kobi?

00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:29.836
Kobi!

00:35:29.887 --> 00:35:44.473
But they're so cute!

00:35:46.496 --> 00:35:47.458
But you don't!

00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:51.946
I think... Ruffians, maybe you feel like this too, but...

00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:52.086
Konobi

00:35:52.353 --> 00:35:54.155
They love to run around and take naps.

00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:55.537
I like that too!

00:35:56.658 --> 00:35:58.640
Yeah, who doesn't love running around and taking naps?

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.020
Right?

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.022
You like that, right?

00:36:00.122 --> 00:36:01.323
Ruffians, you know it.

00:36:01.703 --> 00:36:04.386
No work, no school, no bills.

00:36:05.287 --> 00:36:06.769
Sounds like a good life, right?

00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:07.910
Run around, take naps.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.271
Yes.

00:36:09.592 --> 00:36:11.254
Don't be the gene, don't be the gene.

00:36:11.674 --> 00:36:12.415
What a good life.

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:13.476
Right?

00:36:14.097 --> 00:36:15.519
Yeah, you like the naps part.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.283
Eventually though, you're like, oh, I'm not done.

00:36:19.303 --> 00:36:20.284
Time for a run, right?

00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:25.658
I wish you could take more naps, but I wish you could take more runs too because it's good!

00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:28.042
It's good!

00:36:28.062 --> 00:36:28.162
Yeah!

00:36:28.242 --> 00:36:31.907
I feel that way too.

00:36:31.927 --> 00:36:35.292
But look at the... I want to see what it's like all on a walk together.

00:36:35.312 --> 00:36:36.995
I wonder if it's going to be chaotic.

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.819
Who do you think gets the ball when one ball is thrown?

00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:42.222
Um, Koi.

00:36:44.547 --> 00:36:46.630
BAU BAU BAU!

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:47.812
Clyde just looks faster.

00:36:47.853 --> 00:36:48.934
Clyde's faster.

00:36:48.954 --> 00:36:51.899
How does Clyde BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:58.791
I think he's sort of like... BAU.

00:36:58.811 --> 00:36:58.891
BAU.

00:36:58.911 --> 00:36:58.991
BAU.

00:36:59.011 --> 00:36:59.091
BAU.

00:36:59.111 --> 00:36:59.191
BAU.

00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:00.814
And Kenobi!

00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:02.497
How does Kenobi BAU BAU?

00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:07.365
Those big ears like that!

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.593
What about Colby?

00:37:09.613 --> 00:37:18.205
I think it will be hard to tell Kenobi and Colby apart.

00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:19.367
No, it's very different.

00:37:19.687 --> 00:37:22.191
The intonation is different.

00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:25.776
I can tell them apart.

00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:31.593
I'm sure it's always interesting with all three of them by your side.

00:37:32.154 --> 00:37:34.278
You know who gets the right leg who gets the left side?

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:39.248
Maybe somebody's walking right in between your legs too, huh?

00:37:39.268 --> 00:37:40.651
Don't trip, okay?

00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:45.200
Yeah, and I'm sure you know probably everybody knows you at the park too.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.224
What a cute family.

00:37:48.048 --> 00:37:54.386
But please make sure you know that you're careful, you're equal with the distribution of treats and head parts amongst them.

00:37:54.526 --> 00:37:55.850
It's very important.

00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:57.535
It has to be equal.

00:37:57.555 --> 00:38:03.070
BAU BAU!

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.255
We are FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:10.861
You know, we're talking about how good it would be to just take naps, go for runs.

00:38:11.502 --> 00:38:15.588
Let's see where you've been going for some walks recently.

00:38:15.608 --> 00:38:17.891
Today, I went on a walk.

00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:19.353
We have de-den!

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:23.840
So blue!

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.082
A blue sky!

00:38:27.285 --> 00:38:28.787
It's like a perfect gradient.

00:38:29.746 --> 00:38:31.048
It's so beautiful!

00:38:31.068 --> 00:38:33.611
I can feel the warmth too!

00:38:33.771 --> 00:38:34.552
Yeah!

00:38:34.972 --> 00:38:37.215
And it's so warm, it's starting to feel like summer!

00:38:37.235 --> 00:38:42.802
I guess it is kind of mid-April now, right?

00:38:44.724 --> 00:38:46.506
That's like summer territory, right?

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:47.828
Is that summer?

00:38:48.348 --> 00:38:49.690
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:38:50.511 --> 00:38:51.833
When is it summer to you?

00:38:51.933 --> 00:38:53.174
When does spring stop?

00:38:53.214 --> 00:38:54.396
When does summer start?

00:38:54.496 --> 00:38:55.257
Not summer yet!

00:38:55.297 --> 00:38:56.378
Summer is here!

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.893
Basically Summer at Peace.

00:38:58.913 --> 00:39:00.355
Because Summer is May.

00:39:00.375 --> 00:39:01.257
I do agree with Summer.

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:03.741
May?

00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:05.083
May!

00:39:05.103 --> 00:39:08.789
I kind of agree with May.

00:39:08.809 --> 00:39:09.490
May, really?

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.594
I think so, yeah.

00:39:12.115 --> 00:39:12.996
Oh no.

00:39:13.016 --> 00:39:13.917
Last week of May.

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:15.921
Very accurate.

00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:18.585
Last week of May, that's still a little bit right.

00:39:20.236 --> 00:39:25.286
But you know, as for distinct smells for each season.

00:39:25.306 --> 00:39:28.152
Yes, absolutely yes they do.

00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:33.943
But you know FUWAMOCO, our sniffers are strong.

00:39:33.963 --> 00:39:37.350
Yes, but I really like the smell of each and every season.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:44.421
But I feel like probably it's spring and fall are the yummiest though.

00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:44.601
I agree.

00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:48.467
Spring is fresh and vegetables.

00:39:49.028 --> 00:39:50.209
I feel like it's vegetables.

00:39:50.229 --> 00:39:51.211
Maybe that's more summer.

00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:54.556
But I feel like it's fresh like a cucumber.

00:39:54.636 --> 00:39:55.798
You know?

00:39:55.818 --> 00:40:00.825
You know in the morning, fall is like comfy leaves and yummy smell.

00:40:00.845 --> 00:40:01.246
Dirt.

00:40:01.687 --> 00:40:02.528
Barbecue.

00:40:02.508 --> 00:40:07.823
Barbecue the leaves.

00:40:08.225 --> 00:40:10.712
Yes, the leaves are being barbecued.

00:40:10.732 --> 00:40:12.136
Are you going to eat that then?

00:40:12.457 --> 00:40:13.279
I like the smell.

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:15.285
The dirt is going to eat the barbecue leaves.

00:40:17.847 --> 00:40:19.829
It's good.

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:20.210
Yeah.

00:40:20.911 --> 00:40:22.613
You know, you understand good.

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:26.097
It still feels like winter with you, hololive.

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.840
I shall get warm soon, you know.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.641
And it'll be summer.

00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:31.003
It'll be winter.

00:40:31.023 --> 00:40:31.744
Summer.

00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:32.925
Winter!

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:33.906
It'll be summer!

00:40:34.447 --> 00:40:34.707
Winter.

00:40:35.388 --> 00:40:37.070
Just like that.

00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:38.792
BAU BAU!

00:40:38.772 --> 00:40:41.195
I'm glad you had such a good walk.

00:40:43.297 --> 00:40:43.697
Next!

00:40:43.717 --> 00:40:45.840
We have our Question of the Day!

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.385
What kind of question did we get today?

00:40:51.326 --> 00:40:52.307
De-den!

00:40:52.327 --> 00:40:52.587
Hey FUWAMOCO!

00:40:52.647 --> 00:40:54.829
You guys like potato chips?

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.372
If not, are there any snacks you like to have?

00:40:57.392 --> 00:40:58.453
Beside Ponder Wings.

00:40:58.774 --> 00:41:00.295
Ponder Wings aren't just snacks.

00:41:01.036 --> 00:41:02.738
Ponder Wings are life.

00:41:02.718 --> 00:41:04.401
BAU BAU!

00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:07.687
MAMA!

00:41:07.707 --> 00:41:07.988
Ruffians!

00:41:08.448 --> 00:41:12.596
What do you think, huh?

00:41:12.696 --> 00:41:14.179
Take a chip and eat it.

00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:19.268
Good question.

00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:23.215
I feel like you don't like chips.

00:41:24.097 --> 00:41:24.818
You like fries.

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:26.802
I'm glad you like fries.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:33.755
I have some fries and chips for you and me.

00:41:33.775 --> 00:41:38.926
I don't really like super oily foods that much, you know.

00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:46.583
But if we do eat chips, what's your favorite, Moco-chan?

00:41:46.603 --> 00:41:46.984
My favorite!

00:41:48.128 --> 00:41:51.278
It's all done, baby!

00:41:51.338 --> 00:41:54.849
You know, really, really vinegary and salty.

00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:56.314
I really like sour stuff, right?

00:41:56.394 --> 00:41:58.982
So I feel like that's what it falls in now.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:04.487
Ruffians, you're like so vinegar too!

00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:11.576
I thought you'd be like... It's so crazy I like it!

00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:16.743
Vinegar really really strong!

00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:24.514
You don't like so so much that your mouth feels like a little funny afterwards.

00:42:25.135 --> 00:42:31.708
You know like every time you take a bite and you have a chip, it's like you can feel like a minus two HP?

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.091
That kind?

00:42:34.995 --> 00:42:35.095
Yeah.

00:42:35.115 --> 00:42:36.739
Yeah, they're too sour for you.

00:42:36.859 --> 00:42:38.683
It's okay, we'll eat them then.

00:42:38.703 --> 00:42:39.805
Yeah.

00:42:39.825 --> 00:42:40.486
Maybe sometime.

00:42:40.506 --> 00:42:46.198
It does kind of hurt though, and then afterwards you're kind of like... Maybe I shouldn't have had that.

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.845
Yeah, but it's good fun.

00:42:48.905 --> 00:42:54.990
But I think all in all though, we don't really eat snacks that much.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.231
Does Kamekama bar count?

00:42:57.072 --> 00:42:57.172
Yeah.

00:42:57.973 --> 00:43:01.756
You know, the imitation crab bar.

00:43:01.776 --> 00:43:02.157
Yeah, Kamekama bar!

00:43:02.177 --> 00:43:04.178
I don't know if that counts as a snack though.

00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:04.819
It counts.

00:43:05.159 --> 00:43:05.960
Ruffians say yes.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.962
If we have a snack, then we have that as a snack.

00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:12.946
But we don't really have snacks.

00:43:12.966 --> 00:43:13.126
BAU BAU!

00:43:14.027 --> 00:43:16.489
Pongering is not a snack, Ruffians!

00:43:17.802 --> 00:43:20.866
BAU BAU!

00:43:21.988 --> 00:43:23.430
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.650
Thank you!

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.915
And thank you for your submissions, too, you know.

00:43:27.235 --> 00:43:30.360
Remember, you know, if you have a dog the other day, like, oh, that was a cute dog.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.722
Maybe you saw a bunch of dogs.

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:35.006
Or you happen to see a very nasty Pero.

00:43:35.026 --> 00:43:36.509
Or you have a question.

00:43:37.129 --> 00:43:37.971
Please!

00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:38.131
Please!

00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:39.192
Use the hashtag!

00:43:40.554 --> 00:43:42.137
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:43:42.257 --> 00:43:44.119
And let us know what you did.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.261
What's up!

00:43:45.241 --> 00:43:46.483
Same!

00:43:48.026 --> 00:43:50.229
BAU BAU!

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.573
Thank you Ruffians.

00:43:53.935 --> 00:43:55.999
Our next stream!

00:43:56.019 --> 00:43:58.042
We have another stream coming up.

00:43:58.823 --> 00:43:59.605
It's pretty amazing.

00:43:59.665 --> 00:44:00.206
Are you ready?

00:44:00.466 --> 00:44:05.154
Tonight we have some important homework that we need to get done.

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:06.135
But!

00:44:07.217 --> 00:44:07.978
I'm ready for this.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.561
Get ready for this.

00:44:10.283 --> 00:44:14.330
We'll be... De-den!

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:20.180
On Saturday at 6pm, we'll be doing a membership together with the Doggy Pack!

00:44:20.641 --> 00:44:22.103
I'm using thumbnail, alright?

00:44:22.123 --> 00:44:23.726
I wanna play Fall Guys, FUWAMOCO fans!

00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:24.467
I wanna play Fall Guys!

00:44:24.487 --> 00:44:27.773
Moco-chan's like... I wanna play Fall Guys!

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:31.379
Can we play Fall Guys?

00:44:31.399 --> 00:44:31.920
I don't know...

00:44:33.385 --> 00:44:34.006
Yeah!

00:44:34.847 --> 00:44:36.529
If that's what you think yo!

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.611
Four guys!

00:44:37.631 --> 00:44:39.193
Four guys!

00:44:39.213 --> 00:44:39.593
You know?

00:44:39.613 --> 00:44:44.540
I wanna play four guys.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.403
You kinda wanna chat?

00:44:47.423 --> 00:44:48.625
That's what we were thinking!

00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:51.749
We were thinking, you know, we could play four guys and then we could kinda chat!

00:44:53.231 --> 00:44:55.334
You better play as Ruffians!

00:44:55.354 --> 00:45:02.363
It seems like Ruffians kinda... If that's what Ruffians are thinking of then... That's what I'm kinda thinking of.

00:45:03.457 --> 00:45:08.707
If that's what you wanna do, let's go on it, okay?

00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:09.449
I'm looking forward to it, Ruffians!

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:11.613
Thank you!

00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:11.894
Thank you!

00:45:11.914 --> 00:45:18.727
I will also be showing up somewhere else too, so... You have to catch us once you can find out about it.

00:45:18.888 --> 00:45:19.669
Okay?

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.671

00:46:25.014 --> 00:46:25.995
BAU BAU!

00:46:25.975 --> 00:46:38.317
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:46:38.698 --> 00:46:49.317
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
