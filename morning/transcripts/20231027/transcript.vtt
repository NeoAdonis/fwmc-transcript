00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.698
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:11.758 --> 00:05:16.060
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:25.564
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:27.765
BAU!

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:32.147
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:35.468
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:35.588 --> 00:05:37.609
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:45.525
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:46.426
Yes.

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:47.106
Yes.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:55.371
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 37th episode.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:55.870
37!

00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:56.111
Huh?

00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:58.052
That's almost the whole human life.

00:05:58.072 --> 00:06:00.754
37 years is almost a full spooky.

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:08.543
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:10.145
BAU BAU!

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:11.666
I don't really get it.

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:13.488
37 times 2.

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:13.988
Or 3.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.271
Spooky.

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:18.872
3 if we do our best.

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:20.714
The humans do our best.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.016
Yeah.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:24.837
Ruffians.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.118
I see a few Ruffians.

00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:29.429
It might be the first FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.911
Maybe it's the first time you woke up early.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.211
It's nice to meet you.

00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:45.219
To explain about FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show that is held every Friday to this Wednesday and Monday.

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:46.860
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.580
Makes sense.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.941
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.062
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:57.565
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:00.006
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:01.367
Hashtag.

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:03.327
FWMCMORNING.

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:04.448
It's not funny!

00:07:04.748 --> 00:07:05.408
It's funny.

00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:06.309
It's not.

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.550
I'm saying the hashtag.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.411
Hashtag this.

00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:12.892
Is it necessary though?

00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:13.352
It is.

00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:15.953
It's not a bit funny.

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:17.034
It is not funny.

00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:19.076
Very serious.

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:21.538
Wow, let's ignore that.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:25.982
And all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:26.923
BAU BAU!

00:07:26.963 --> 00:07:30.246
Oh, Ruffians.

00:07:30.286 --> 00:07:31.247
Did you ignore it?

00:07:31.928 --> 00:07:33.689
It's been a bit of a busy week.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.631
Bit of a spooky week.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:39.134
And you know, Halloween's just right around the corner.

00:07:39.977 --> 00:07:43.420
But, I don't know, what's Pero off doing?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.521
Oh, who knows?

00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:45.221
Who cares?

00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:46.142
Have you seen him?

00:07:47.543 --> 00:07:53.407
I think one Ruffian saw him!

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:55.789
De-den.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.834
It looks like this Ruffian came across some inspiration while they were busy carving pumpkins for Halloween.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:04.436
It looks nice.

00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:04.816
Right?

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:06.417
I think it turned out great.

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:08.299
What?

00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:10.615
Pero didn't get in the way though, right?

00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:14.716
Especially when you use all the sharp knives to cut the pumpkin.

00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:20.018
You know, sometimes Pero can get a little bit mysterious.

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:22.979
A little bit mischievous and mysterious.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:25.440
She's got knives and everything.

00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:33.066
I'm glad it was okay though, but you know, yeah, you finished the pumpkin!

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:33.727
Yeah!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.728
It looks amazing and I think all your fingers are still attached.

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:38.389
Hopefully!

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.010
I think the Ruffian would have let us know, right?

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.290
Maybe.

00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:48.638
You know, you really got Pero's ears there and the wings and the horns too!

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:53.101
Actually, I think Pero kind of looks a bit proud of your pumpkin, you know?

00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:54.122
A bit proud, yeah.

00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:54.822
A bit smug.

00:08:54.842 --> 00:09:00.485
It seems like it rubbed his ego just in the right spot by having his very own pumpkin.

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:00.846
Right.

00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:05.789
Maybe he feels like it's sort of like a statue of him or like

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.950
It's a pumpkin.

00:09:16.602 --> 00:09:17.883
It's just a pumpkin.

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:19.824
It's not a statue.

00:09:20.324 --> 00:09:28.730
Well, you know, as long as Pero's in a good mood and he's not messing with you, I guess it's okay, right?

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.231
All's well that ends well, right?

00:09:31.952 --> 00:09:35.474
We'd really like to see what the pumpkin looks like all lit up, too.

00:09:35.514 --> 00:09:36.575
Oh yeah!

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:37.155
At night!

00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:40.097
Have a happy Halloween!

00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:41.138
Halloween!

00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:43.139
BAU BAU!

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.079
Halloween!

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:44.800
Halloween!

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.981
Hello Halloween, BAU BAU!

00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:49.142
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:50.983
BAU BAU!

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:52.464
I'm Ruffians!

00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:54.525
On the topic of Halloween.

00:09:55.765 --> 00:09:58.147
If you didn't know it, we have.

00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:00.908
We're asking something of you.

00:10:01.188 --> 00:10:01.729
We are.

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:03.790
Ruffians.

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:06.803
You're gonna join us for Halloween, right?

00:10:07.143 --> 00:10:07.844
Right!

00:10:08.444 --> 00:10:14.107
And we're gonna share some spooky stories together with you, right?

00:10:14.668 --> 00:10:15.888
But not just any stories.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:16.168
No!

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:18.430
Those stories will be written by you!

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.510
Yeah!

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.832
Well, I guess most of them, right?

00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:28.235
Because maybe we'll write some too, but the spookiest part

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.976
You won't know if it was us or not, hai!

00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:33.680
Which one is us, hai!

00:10:38.313 --> 00:10:43.515
Well, you can submit your stories to us through our Google Form, which is in the description below.

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:44.816
Just look down a bit, okay?

00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:46.696
Just look a little bit down.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:54.099
But we'd like to ask you to write completely original stories that are around 250 to 1,000 words in length.

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:57.961
Don't worry if it's a bit over 1,000.

00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:58.641
A bit under.

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.682
It's okay.

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:03.583
Yeah, we're not gonna take a grade off or anything.

00:11:03.623 --> 00:11:03.683
No!

00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:05.544
We're not your teacher.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:09.588
But there's other things that we'd like you to be mindful of too.

00:11:09.928 --> 00:11:13.872
That they don't contain any characters or properties from other IPs.

00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:16.114
But hololive is okay, the original characters are good.

00:11:16.354 --> 00:11:18.015
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:22.499
And that they don't have any offensive content either.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.441
Easy to team, okay?

00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:30.164
But it also, it really really needs to be completely original, okay?

00:11:30.684 --> 00:11:34.906
We want you Ruffians to have written it, not anyone else that defeats the point.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:36.327
Defeats the point.

00:11:36.707 --> 00:11:41.370
Yeah, but there could be like silly and spooky stories that actually happen to you too.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.611
Or maybe ones that are just in your head.

00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:48.054
But you know, anything that helps you get writing a little bit.

00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:51.956
We're looking forward to sharing stories all together on a

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:55.410
Special first Halloween night together!

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.033
BAU BAU!

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.698
Well, Halloween stuff doesn't quite end there.

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:10.367
We have... In case you missed it... The Manor!

00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:12.069
Ruffians!

00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:14.029
Spooky stories, huh?

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:19.473
You had a chance to listen to our very first vocal dramas all together with Advent, right?

00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:21.314
Yeah, the manners!

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.875
You haven't forgotten, right?

00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:24.756
Yeah.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.158
Yes, yes, good!

00:12:28.278 --> 00:12:34.583
It's a spooky voice drama that us and Advent participated in as part of the Advent Halloween Party!

00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:40.847
We weren't our usual FUWAMOCO self that you know us as, but we were two maid sisters!

00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:43.087
Maria and Aria.

00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:44.772
Not Cuban dog sisters!

00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:45.073
No!

00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:51.275
If you haven't had a chance to check it out yet, you can find it on the hololive store!

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:55.498
We'd love it if you could have a listen to it while it's still spooky to you.

00:12:56.038 --> 00:13:04.444
Also, Advent has some extra spooky and cool t-shirts and apparel on sale right now as well.

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:07.386
You can find that over on Amazon!

00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:11.969
Bit of a different place, but this time just search up hololive production to find them.

00:13:13.368 --> 00:13:13.528
BAU BAU!

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:43.193
Halloween's gonna be over soon, but...

00:13:43.868 --> 00:13:46.829
There's also something else very big coming up.

00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:47.989
Very important!

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:48.469
You know what?

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:55.371
Right after Halloween is the yearly hololive Sports Festival!

00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:59.052
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:02.552
We're participating on the Red B Team!

00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:03.233
Red Team!

00:14:03.253 --> 00:14:11.394
And we're together with Aki-senpai, Mel-senpai, Aoi, Ina-senpai, and Calli-senpai!

00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:12.815
We're very excited.

00:14:14.338 --> 00:14:16.159
Very, very excited Ruffians!

00:14:16.499 --> 00:14:19.942
I, Jimmy Kinaflames, you're excited for that, huh?

00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:23.244
Well, I'm excited because it's gonna be fun!

00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:31.009
And we're really happy to have this opportunity, but... It's also a bit nerve-wracking.

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:32.990
Yeah, we're nervous.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.872
We're gonna do our best to make our senpai proud!

00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:39.294
But we also hope that Lady Luck is on our side too.

00:14:42.469 --> 00:14:45.070
Going to make sure to practice as much as we can!

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:48.172
To get a bit more used to Minecraft.

00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:53.375
It'll also be our first sports day ever, so... Lots of firsts.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.876
A lot of firsts, yeah.

00:14:55.556 --> 00:15:00.479
Is there anything you think we should look out or know in particular, Ruffians?

00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:06.567
Look out for... You know, like, oh, this senpai, this is a bit tricky for them.

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:07.947
I think it might be tricky for FUWAMOCO.

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:09.428
Or like, Minecraft is this.

00:15:10.669 --> 00:15:12.130
Practice in front of the Ruffians.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.151
Okay!

00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.132
Are you sure you want that?

00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:18.114
Don't use controller, but I don't think Minecraft works.

00:15:18.174 --> 00:15:19.115
No, no controller.

00:15:19.155 --> 00:15:20.336
You have to use keyboard.

00:15:20.696 --> 00:15:23.478
Like, oh, that's not much we can do about that.

00:15:23.738 --> 00:15:24.639
Out of our control.

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:25.619
Double W for dash.

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:29.657
Ah, yes, yes, yes!

00:15:29.777 --> 00:15:31.258
I learned that the other day again!

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:32.880
Yeah!

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.661
I have to write down the controls.

00:15:34.942 --> 00:15:36.823
I pray for no server issues.

00:15:37.043 --> 00:15:39.125
I'll do that too.

00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:43.228
Lots to look out for.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.550
Well, we're going to do our best!

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:49.314
So please cheer for the red team lots and lots, okay?

00:15:49.694 --> 00:15:52.897
And especially for us Minecraft newbies, okay?

00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:55.399
Cheer for us, for FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:15:56.977 --> 00:15:59.938
Let's bring victory to the red team!

00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:00.858
Red team!

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:02.539
BAU BAU!

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:03.179
Red team!

00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:03.819
BAU BAU!

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:04.779
We should make a cheer.

00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:05.620
We should.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.320
Lots of things to prepare.

00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:12.801
BAU BAU!

00:16:14.922 --> 00:16:18.143
Ruffians!

00:16:19.023 --> 00:16:21.724
Maybe we have something to confess.

00:16:21.804 --> 00:16:22.604
A confession.

00:16:22.624 --> 00:16:24.905
To confess about FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:16:28.965 --> 00:16:31.507
I don't know if the Ruffians are gonna be happy to hear this.

00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:34.250
Do you have any ideas what it could be?

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:34.310
No.

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:40.055
No?

00:16:40.776 --> 00:16:41.256
Well...

00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:49.000
It's not about how, you know, this is supposed to be a short format show.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.380
Right.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.404
And yet it always seems to be somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes.

00:16:53.464 --> 00:16:53.944
Right.

00:16:54.084 --> 00:16:54.965
It's not that.

00:16:54.985 --> 00:16:56.066
Uh-uh, it's not that.

00:16:56.246 --> 00:17:01.630
You know, it's not that, you know, we see Ruffians saying that it's hard to watch it all before school or work.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.990
No.

00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:03.431
It's not so short.

00:17:03.512 --> 00:17:03.552
No.

00:17:03.952 --> 00:17:04.352
No.

00:17:04.472 --> 00:17:04.692
No.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.102
We're still working on it, I bet.

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:09.942
We're still working on that.

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.903
20 minutes, 20 minutes just to go on.

00:17:12.324 --> 00:17:24.949
But, actually, at first, FUWAMOCO Morning, it was planned to be every single day of the work week.

00:17:25.929 --> 00:17:27.190
Every weekday.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.551
Everyone.

00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:30.271
Can you imagine that?

00:17:31.412 --> 00:17:33.593
How would you feel about that, Ruffians?

00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:37.897
Every day of the work week.

00:17:37.937 --> 00:17:38.657
The weekdays.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:41.319
Right.

00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:45.222
But you know what?

00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:48.305
I don't know if we'd be able to survive that.

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:49.726
Yeah.

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:51.467
We definitely couldn't handle it alone.

00:17:52.308 --> 00:17:53.869
But maybe there's a team.

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:57.151
A team like a FUWAMOCO Morning production team.

00:17:57.171 --> 00:17:57.412
Yeah.

00:17:58.312 --> 00:17:59.673
I don't know when we'd sleep.

00:18:01.573 --> 00:18:02.614
It would be too much.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:06.555
Ruffians, if it was daily, what do you think it would be like?

00:18:07.676 --> 00:18:09.277
Would we have new corners?

00:18:09.637 --> 00:18:13.279
Like a FUWAMOCO live sleep camera?

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:15.860
I don't think YouTube would be happy with that.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.020
No, I don't think so.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.962
Do you think we'd be able to wake up every day for it?

00:18:20.962 --> 00:18:23.984
Maybe it's best that it's only three days a week?

00:18:24.944 --> 00:18:25.504
I think so.

00:18:27.765 --> 00:18:29.726
You want a live sleep camera?

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:33.145
Guests.

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:36.528
Guests and crew.

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:42.912
30 Minute Natto Challenge!

00:18:43.092 --> 00:18:45.774
That's like natto prison for Moco-chan.

00:18:45.794 --> 00:18:48.456
Do they sound more healthy?

00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:50.337
I think so too.

00:18:50.778 --> 00:18:53.339
I'm happy for the FUWAMOCO of the past.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.001
Great choices were made.

00:18:57.697 --> 00:18:59.257
Oh, that would be rough, right?

00:18:59.317 --> 00:19:00.258
Ruffians.

00:19:00.778 --> 00:19:02.478
Do you think you could deal with that?

00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:08.020
It's great being every Friday, Wednesday, Monday, right?

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.100
FUWAMOCO.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:11.960
Exactly.

00:19:13.241 --> 00:19:15.681
Fits all to the timeline.

00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:20.122
It's too much!

00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:22.023
Well then, it's good that it's like this.

00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:22.863
It's good!

00:19:23.023 --> 00:19:23.823
Good for us!

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:24.764
Good for the Ruffians.

00:19:25.204 --> 00:19:26.384
I'm glad, I'm glad.

00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:34.475
I thought for sure the Ruffians would be like... We missed it!

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:34.935
Right?

00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:37.855
It was good.

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:41.156
BAU BAU!

00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:46.417
Now, this is very important, Ruffians.

00:19:46.517 --> 00:19:46.917
Important?

00:19:47.277 --> 00:19:49.058
It's very important!

00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:50.458
That's true.

00:19:50.978 --> 00:19:53.639
Maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.785
I think, you know, there's something that's kind of stuck in the Ruffians' minds because it's a bit unpleasant.

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:03.166
Right?

00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:07.789
And maybe it's become a bit of a misunderstanding too.

00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:14.654
So, I mentioned it yesterday on Twitter, okay?

00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:20.939
But you know, I saw some Ruffians trying to make Rat King tea.

00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:25.493
But you aren't doing it properly!

00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:27.514
And you know that's bad.

00:20:27.534 --> 00:20:30.816
You're gonna hurt yourself and we don't want that.

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.337
Okay.

00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:40.001
It's very important that the only thing that touches the teabag is hot water.

00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:41.562
That's the first step, okay?

00:20:43.186 --> 00:20:45.407
No, the teabags don't have to be moldy.

00:20:45.447 --> 00:20:48.028
They won't get moldy if you do it properly, okay?

00:20:48.528 --> 00:20:52.009
They don't touch anything except hot water.

00:20:52.389 --> 00:20:55.770
So, no milk, no sugar, nothing.

00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:56.571
Okay?

00:20:57.231 --> 00:20:58.951
Nothing touches the teabag.

00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:00.292
Just water.

00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:02.093
Got it?

00:21:04.353 --> 00:21:05.654
Now, next.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.704
You have to squeeze it out after you're done with it.

00:21:09.724 --> 00:21:10.004
Squeeze.

00:21:10.044 --> 00:21:10.525
Yeah.

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:13.829
So you get all the tea back in the cup.

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:16.672
Okay, so then the teabag should be dry.

00:21:17.593 --> 00:21:18.154
Got it!

00:21:18.474 --> 00:21:20.817
You can't let it sit in a pool of tea.

00:21:21.618 --> 00:21:21.999
Uh-uh.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.481
It has to be dry.

00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:28.239
You can't just put it on the dish, okay?

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:28.539
No.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.000
It has to be dry.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.680
Now, food!

00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:33.661
Each tea bag!

00:21:34.182 --> 00:21:37.723
They need to be spaced out on their own so they can properly dry.

00:21:40.284 --> 00:21:43.866
Just so you know, I'm not giving you a tutorial, okay?

00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:46.467
This is my rat king tea, okay?

00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:47.968
Moco-chan's recipe, okay?

00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:49.908
I just don't want you to hurt yourself!

00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:53.490
They have to properly dry like that.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.191
They can't be touching, okay?

00:21:56.526 --> 00:22:00.291
And finally, they can't keep sitting there for too long.

00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:01.472
I'd say.

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.736
Maybe a week maximum.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:05.337
Maximum.

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:06.238
They don't mold.

00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:07.840
I've never had issues with mold.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.622
Not in the Northwest Passage.

00:22:09.642 --> 00:22:11.264
They don't mold, okay?

00:22:12.505 --> 00:22:14.367
But with that, the weak rule.

00:22:14.387 --> 00:22:15.909
More than anything.

00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:22.547
It's that I don't like having the used teabags sitting out from where I can see them.

00:22:23.347 --> 00:22:23.927
That's the issue.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:24.988
They just don't look very nice.

00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.329
They don't look nice, no.

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:30.131
But this way, I've never had issues with mold.

00:22:30.471 --> 00:22:31.832
My tummy's never hurt.

00:22:32.032 --> 00:22:32.392
Nothing.

00:22:33.013 --> 00:22:33.413
It's good.

00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:33.933
Okay.

00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:37.876
It's just resourceful to get another teacup out of the teabags.

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:39.196
Got it.

00:22:39.216 --> 00:22:42.538
Write that down.

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:43.999
Don't write that down.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.640
It's not a tutorial.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.061
Just don't hurt yourself.

00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:52.003
Good kids don't copy Moco-chan, right?

00:22:53.524 --> 00:22:55.065
You're not gonna hurt yourself, right?

00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:56.466
No sugar.

00:22:56.846 --> 00:22:57.466
No milk.

00:22:57.987 --> 00:22:58.387
Okay.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:22:59.807
You do that after.

00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:01.548
After.

00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:04.150
Understood.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.310
Understood.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.011
Good, good.

00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:07.412
It's not a tutorial!

00:23:07.472 --> 00:23:09.072
Not a tutorial!

00:23:11.314 --> 00:23:12.754
Just buy more tea bags.

00:23:16.096 --> 00:23:17.277
Easier said than done.

00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:20.693
Do you understand Ruffians?

00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:25.157
Do you still have a problem with Moco-chan's habits?

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.983
My tummy hurts when it's scary, okay?

00:23:33.264 --> 00:23:35.686
Not because of the rat king tea, right?

00:23:36.487 --> 00:23:37.088
Yes!

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.011
No, not really.

00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:42.813
It's good to be honest.

00:23:46.283 --> 00:23:48.604
If it makes her happy, dot dot dot.

00:23:49.104 --> 00:23:50.685
It's just resourceful, okay?

00:23:51.525 --> 00:23:52.746
I won't try it, but got it.

00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:54.206
That's the spirit!

00:23:54.386 --> 00:23:54.907
Alright.

00:23:54.947 --> 00:23:56.867
Just understand, okay?

00:23:57.107 --> 00:24:04.050
I don't know if the Ruffians quite understand it yet, Moco-chan, but... It's time for Mococo to stop.

00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:06.891
Stop?

00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:11.973
Stop, Moco-chan?

00:24:13.454 --> 00:24:14.294
Big sigh.

00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:20.104
Not Mococo.

00:24:21.045 --> 00:24:21.305
No.

00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:23.547
Better stop.

00:24:24.788 --> 00:24:25.668
Please stop.

00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:27.210
Dot, dot, dot.

00:24:29.892 --> 00:24:30.792
What, lapero thing?

00:24:30.893 --> 00:24:34.395
I don't care about lapero things!

00:24:37.778 --> 00:24:39.519
It seems like the Ruffians accept it.

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:41.601
Moco-chan.

00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:44.463
Oh, you're a different size.

00:24:44.523 --> 00:24:44.723
Wait.

00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:51.171
You'll accept Moco-chan even if she drinks the Rat King tea!

00:24:53.833 --> 00:24:54.354
Thank you!

00:24:54.374 --> 00:24:56.956
Thank you!

00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:00.058
BAU BAU!

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:00.359
BAU BAU!

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:01.940
That's happy, right Moco-chan?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.141
What?

00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:04.562
We're Ruffians!

00:25:04.782 --> 00:25:06.144
We do!

00:25:06.384 --> 00:25:07.605
We do!

00:25:08.346 --> 00:25:12.069
Ruffians... Well... You know...

00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:14.819
Dad!

00:25:14.859 --> 00:25:15.179
Guess what?

00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:34.807
He picks the lightbulb!

00:25:34.847 --> 00:25:36.168
We have light!

00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:39.311
We live in a world with den now!

00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:41.733
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:25:42.353 --> 00:25:43.735
Yeah, it's so nice.

00:25:44.135 --> 00:25:47.337
You know, especially when the days just keep on getting darker and colder.

00:25:48.538 --> 00:25:49.479
We have light now.

00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:53.983
Actually, it's why it's so cold so quickly.

00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:57.786
We thought that we left the air conditioning on by accident, but...

00:26:00.574 --> 00:26:03.255
This is the start of a new reality.

00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:13.962
Maybe... Maybe it's time to start eating more yummy food so we can get fluffy and fuzzy for the winter!

00:26:14.383 --> 00:26:14.963
Soup.

00:26:15.003 --> 00:26:16.304
We already eat soup.

00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:22.748
I don't know if getting fluffier and fuzzier is a proper solution, Moco-chan, you know?

00:26:23.089 --> 00:26:25.890
Instead of like more insulation for our bodies, you know?

00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.093
It's gonna take some time to kind of get rid of in the spring.

00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:32.136
We can just put on sweaters, you know?

00:26:32.156 --> 00:26:34.341
Sweaters or fluffy pajamas and ride.

00:26:34.422 --> 00:26:35.685
But what if I wanna eat?

00:26:36.903 --> 00:26:37.323
Stew.

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:39.665
Stew?

00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:42.466
How is soup and stew different that much?

00:26:42.806 --> 00:26:46.268
Stew's expensive, soup is cheap.

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.810
I guess.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.190
Stew is stew.

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:51.051
What?

00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:53.072
That's what I was called.

00:26:53.152 --> 00:26:54.293
Stew is stew!

00:26:54.593 --> 00:26:55.073
No!

00:26:55.774 --> 00:26:58.015
Stew is a stew, right?

00:26:58.655 --> 00:26:59.496
And a soup.

00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:00.676
Soup.

00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:03.018
It's like it's a stoop and soup.

00:27:06.974 --> 00:27:07.314
Hi.

00:27:08.655 --> 00:27:10.316
Ruffians, you get it right.

00:27:10.336 --> 00:27:11.536
I don't think I get your brain.

00:27:13.077 --> 00:27:15.898
Soup and stew and soup and stoop.

00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:18.179
Right?

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:19.500
They're similar but different.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.501
I think it's time for you to go back to bed.

00:27:23.002 --> 00:27:24.342
Well, happy news!

00:27:24.662 --> 00:27:25.603
Happy news!

00:27:25.623 --> 00:27:27.324
We have a light!

00:27:27.504 --> 00:27:28.524
Yeah!

00:27:29.845 --> 00:27:31.966
BAU BAU!

00:27:34.521 --> 00:27:36.222
Enough with the silliness.

00:27:36.402 --> 00:27:40.345
Maybe we'll check out some of our regular costumes here.

00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:49.211
The Doggie of the Day is... Dan Lily!

00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:52.293
She's super cute, look at all that.

00:27:52.493 --> 00:27:55.675
What kind of Halloween costume do you think this is though?

00:27:57.285 --> 00:27:57.947
A lion?

00:27:58.287 --> 00:27:59.129
A monster?

00:27:59.149 --> 00:28:00.972
An SSR?

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:01.834
Makusou?

00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:03.436
Version of... Really?

00:28:04.642 --> 00:28:05.323
Definitely that.

00:28:05.363 --> 00:28:08.325
It's cute though!

00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:10.566
It makes me want to fluff her up.

00:28:10.626 --> 00:28:12.688
She has crazy hair!

00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:13.669
Right?

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:15.130
Cute!

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.412
I was thinking, how does she BAU BAU?

00:28:18.712 --> 00:28:21.294
You know, I think it would have to match the costume, right?

00:28:21.314 --> 00:28:23.736
Like an SSR BAU BAU.

00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:26.178
I think it would be still sort of rough.

00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:27.419
BAU BAU it!

00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:30.198
BAU BAU!

00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:31.398
Why does it have the power?

00:28:31.818 --> 00:28:32.998
SSR, Moco-chan.

00:28:33.338 --> 00:28:34.879
Oh, SSR power?

00:28:34.939 --> 00:28:35.439
Yeah.

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:36.579
What's that?

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:37.880
BAU BAU!

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:38.640
Like that.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.080
I think that's fair.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:40.480
Right?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.321
Like, when Pokemon, when they evolve, they're, they're, they're cool?

00:28:44.582 --> 00:28:45.762
They kind of get all weird, right?

00:28:45.782 --> 00:28:46.842
Before it's like, wee-dee-weep!

00:28:46.942 --> 00:28:48.123
And then it's like, BAU BAU!

00:28:48.543 --> 00:28:48.903
Right?

00:28:49.263 --> 00:28:49.963
I guess, right?

00:28:50.283 --> 00:28:51.263
Uh-huh, makes sense.

00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:51.964
Uh-huh.

00:28:52.584 --> 00:28:56.545
Well, I think Lily really enjoys Halloween with you.

00:28:57.955 --> 00:29:03.976
There's lots of fun things going on, and new people to meet, and even more fun costumes.

00:29:04.337 --> 00:29:12.478
For one day a year, she gets to become a little bit of a different, a different kind of Lucia, a different side of herself.

00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:15.279
Lucia, she loves you very much.

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:16.760
BAU BAU!

00:29:20.005 --> 00:29:23.349
Even though it's getting cold in, we're still going out, right?

00:29:23.589 --> 00:29:24.890
Let's see where you went!

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:25.671
I'm excited.

00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:27.834
The walks have been very pretty.

00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:28.494
It's a pinky.

00:29:36.778 --> 00:29:37.919
The colors!

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.661
The colors!

00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:40.582
It's a painting.

00:29:40.622 --> 00:29:45.928
You know, I feel like I have every color I need to paint a beautiful picture, right?

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:48.631
It's a painting.

00:29:48.711 --> 00:29:52.535
I feel like I need to add nature sounds in the corner, right?

00:29:56.448 --> 00:29:57.729
Howl!

00:29:57.869 --> 00:29:58.029
Howl!

00:29:58.049 --> 00:29:58.169
Howl!

00:29:58.209 --> 00:29:58.389
Howl!

00:30:14.484 --> 00:30:15.445
A new alarm!

00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:18.908
A dentist!

00:30:19.928 --> 00:30:20.088
No!

00:30:20.108 --> 00:30:21.950
These are furry sounds, okay?

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.212
What is furry?

00:30:24.452 --> 00:30:25.352
A robot!

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:26.273
No!

00:30:26.293 --> 00:30:27.514
I don't know.

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.616
Maybe we didn't quite get it, Moco-chan.

00:30:29.656 --> 00:30:30.296
Maybe not.

00:30:30.576 --> 00:30:33.799
Oh, but I can definitely tell why this would be your favorite song.

00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:34.599
Yeah!

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.043
Maybe next time you go, you can let out a big BAU BAU for us.

00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:41.104
Maybe it will echo.

00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:41.244
Oh.

00:30:42.597 --> 00:30:43.217
BAU BAU!

00:30:43.277 --> 00:30:44.858
Like that.

00:30:44.938 --> 00:30:45.478
BAU!

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:48.060
BAU BAU!

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.080
So many colors.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.041
I'm not envious.

00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:53.762
Uh-uh.

00:30:53.822 --> 00:30:54.623
Right?

00:30:54.663 --> 00:30:54.863
Nope.

00:30:54.903 --> 00:30:57.984
We got a question from a Ruffian too.

00:30:58.004 --> 00:30:59.665
Our Question of the Day is...

00:31:09.324 --> 00:31:11.304
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:17.166
Is there any specific food that instantly teleports you back to your childhood when you eat it?

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:21.687
For me, it's the pasta salad that my mom always used to make for dinner.

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:22.507
Love you!

00:31:22.587 --> 00:31:23.467
Screams!

00:31:24.727 --> 00:31:29.008
BAU BAU!

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:31.529
I don't know, it's not really a food.

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:36.292
But, I wanted to eat it, but I don't think they make it anymore.

00:31:36.592 --> 00:31:39.555
For some reason, I really- Hi.

00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:43.058
I really remember, uh, these sort of cloth drops.

00:31:43.798 --> 00:31:46.881
They were black liquid, and they came in a roll.

00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:49.023
And they were called, I think, beach knots.

00:31:49.203 --> 00:31:49.443
Right?

00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:51.385
And the paper was like a wax paper?

00:31:51.405 --> 00:31:52.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:52.686 --> 00:31:54.067
It was fun to unwrap them.

00:31:54.127 --> 00:31:54.707
Beach knots.

00:31:54.767 --> 00:31:56.629
But it came in a roll, they were all connected.

00:31:56.689 --> 00:31:58.330
They were cloth drops.

00:32:00.912 --> 00:32:01.773
Does that make sense?

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:05.574
I don't think so, but... I don't know if that's really a food, but I would like to have that.

00:32:05.594 --> 00:32:16.559
For me... It's not a food either, but I feel like... Moco-chan, I don't... I'm pretty sure you probably had the same one, too.

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:20.341
Because if we get ice cream, you always pick the same thing as me, too, right?

00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:21.621
That's just how it goes, right?

00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:23.062
But there was one time...

00:32:24.378 --> 00:32:25.178
It was flat.

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.319
But it was round.

00:32:41.654 --> 00:32:46.058
And it tasted like the most orange you could ever imagine.

00:32:46.078 --> 00:32:48.681
I can remember it so much.

00:32:48.721 --> 00:32:51.864
Just thinking of it makes my mouth kind of water a bit.

00:32:51.904 --> 00:32:53.826
But I only ever had it that once.

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:55.667
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:32:55.687 --> 00:32:56.848
An orange popsicle.

00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:58.090
It was shiny!

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.893
How does it remind you of your childhood if you had it once?

00:33:02.254 --> 00:33:04.336
Because it reminded me of eating it that once.

00:33:05.407 --> 00:33:07.107
Why the taste of the color orange?

00:33:07.187 --> 00:33:07.867
Exactly!

00:33:07.887 --> 00:33:10.428
It tasted so orange!

00:33:11.428 --> 00:33:12.428
So orange!

00:33:12.688 --> 00:33:14.389
I don't know, you could just eat an orange.

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:16.249
No, it was better than that.

00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:20.810
It was like pure, pure orange.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.110
It was good.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.351
Fuwawa's core memory?

00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:26.291
It is!

00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:28.691
I only had it once and I remember it.

00:33:29.071 --> 00:33:33.092
Other than that, no like, cough drops and popsicles aren't food.

00:33:35.427 --> 00:33:40.729
I guess I remember the many, many carrot sticks we had to eat.

00:33:41.189 --> 00:33:41.629
Yeah.

00:33:41.989 --> 00:33:46.650
And sometimes, you know, eating carrot sticks multiple times a day.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.751
It's a lot of carrots.

00:33:49.231 --> 00:33:52.492
So they kind of get boiled and you think, what can I do to make this interesting?

00:33:53.212 --> 00:33:58.173
So then you take some yellow mustard and you eat it with the carrot and it actually tastes kind of good.

00:33:58.193 --> 00:34:00.634
Moco-chan, why are you shaking your head?

00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:01.654
You did it too!

00:34:01.734 --> 00:34:03.455
Yes, but I don't like the memory.

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:07.617
Ruffians, did you ever do that?

00:34:07.658 --> 00:34:07.938
Same!

00:34:07.978 --> 00:34:09.479
Same!

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:09.980
Yes.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.301
We have to eat it.

00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:13.142
Otherwise there's no escape.

00:34:13.483 --> 00:34:14.504
There's no escape.

00:34:14.824 --> 00:34:15.765
You have to eat it.

00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:18.227
Why not ranch?

00:34:18.267 --> 00:34:18.848
No ranch.

00:34:19.288 --> 00:34:20.950
No stuff like that.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.750
No ranch.

00:34:22.291 --> 00:34:23.031
Yellow mustard.

00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:29.533
I don't like this.

00:34:29.713 --> 00:34:30.874
I'll go without that.

00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:31.334
Thank you.

00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:35.716
I hope your pasta salad was yummy.

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:36.977
Yummier than that.

00:34:37.057 --> 00:34:38.257
And carrots with mustard.

00:34:39.097 --> 00:34:41.919
I also remember being forced to eat some rice.

00:34:42.799 --> 00:34:43.899
Rice that I didn't like.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.440
I remember falling asleep at the table at night.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.681
I do too.

00:34:48.881 --> 00:34:50.481
We're very picky eaters.

00:34:51.262 --> 00:34:54.283
There's a lot of times when we're imprisoned at the table.

00:34:54.303 --> 00:34:56.523
We're used to being imprisoned.

00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:57.224
BAU BAU!

00:35:03.303 --> 00:35:06.145
We have no time for sleeping!

00:35:06.265 --> 00:35:08.446
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:11.888
And we have more streams coming in!

00:35:11.948 --> 00:35:16.490
Our next stream tonight is a bit spooky, so don't be surprised, okay?

00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:18.091
Get ready, okay, Ruffians?

00:35:18.292 --> 00:35:20.032
You can blur your eyes, okay?

00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:21.453
Blur them, okay.

00:35:21.473 --> 00:35:22.434
Just look into my eyes.

00:35:22.914 --> 00:35:24.615
Okay, it's not scary.

00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:28.117
Tonight, we're going to be playing DRAWL.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.481
I'm trying to make it funny because it's scary.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:39.582
We're worried, Ruffians.

00:35:40.522 --> 00:35:42.743
Please, please, please come help us.

00:35:45.404 --> 00:35:47.244
I don't know if Advent can do this.

00:35:47.864 --> 00:35:53.866
I talked about it yesterday during our member stream, but I have not bought that game.

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:56.007
I have not downloaded the game.

00:35:56.767 --> 00:35:58.888
I need to do that, but it is frightening.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.160
So I need strength.

00:36:01.901 --> 00:36:05.882
Yeah, especially after Paranormal Cleanup last time.

00:36:06.042 --> 00:36:07.423
It's not that scary!

00:36:07.443 --> 00:36:09.804
Our confidence is very strong.

00:36:09.824 --> 00:36:12.445
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:36:12.965 --> 00:36:17.346
You've been watching our streams this month, right?

00:36:17.446 --> 00:36:20.007
I think our confidence is sort of a bit gone, huh?

00:36:20.628 --> 00:36:21.548
A bit depleted.

00:36:21.568 --> 00:36:23.369
Yeah.

00:36:23.669 --> 00:36:24.869
You're shaking already?

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:26.690
Why?

00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:29.113
It's too scary.

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:30.114
Wait, Ruffians.

00:36:30.515 --> 00:36:32.598
Controller isn't supported, right?

00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:35.663
It's not supported.

00:36:35.723 --> 00:36:37.906
It's a keyboard and mouse kind of thing, right?

00:36:39.468 --> 00:36:40.130
Please say so.

00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:41.532
Please say so.

00:36:42.713 --> 00:36:43.274
Please say so.

00:36:49.315 --> 00:36:49.956
We'll see.

00:36:50.697 --> 00:36:56.703
I-I hope it's a keyboard and mouse kind of thing because... then... I just need to help.

00:36:57.344 --> 00:36:59.687
I just need to help.

00:36:59.887 --> 00:37:01.088
You don't recommend controller.

00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:02.190
Okay!

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.511
It has controller support.

00:37:03.551 --> 00:37:05.313
I've never touching anything.

00:37:05.353 --> 00:37:06.615
I've never touching anything.

00:37:08.497 --> 00:37:08.717
Well.

00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:47.967
Our schedule is a little bit different from our normal Saturday. You know, since we have a collab with Biboo on her channel in the evening. We'll be sharing our new schedule with you. A few hours earlier than normal. It's absolutely packed. Is it though?

00:37:48.007 --> 00:37:48.147
Is it?

00:37:52.401 --> 00:38:10.236
Well, we're playing Suica Game in the morning, so if you wake up early with us, then that means you get to find out the schedule for next week earlier, and we hope that you're very much ready because it's a jam-packed week with fun coming up, so... BAU BAU!

00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:12.818
BAU BAU!

00:38:12.838 --> 00:38:17.102
Really busy, but very exciting too!

00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:20.870
Do we have some tricks?

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.931
We do have some tricks and treats!

00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:24.933
Some treats!

00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:29.575
Please look forward to the Ruffians!

00:38:29.655 --> 00:38:32.037
