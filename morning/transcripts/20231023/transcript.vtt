WEBVTT

05:11.898 --> 05:12.178
What?

05:12.478 --> 05:22.049
What?

05:22.750 --> 05:23.931
Yeah, we did awesome!

05:25.252 --> 05:29.217
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:29.477 --> 05:30.118
Are you awake?

05:31.960 --> 05:33.441
Mococo didn't mess up!

05:33.541 --> 05:34.642
Right, Ruffians?

05:35.343 --> 05:36.044
It starts!

05:36.844 --> 05:38.245
Howl, howl, BAU BAU!

05:38.346 --> 05:40.267
Howl, howl, BAU BAU!

05:40.287 --> 05:42.109
What did you say?

05:42.189 --> 05:45.852
It's... I'm just thinking it's time!

05:46.072 --> 05:47.293
Kirito wants more Moco-chan.

05:47.874 --> 05:48.174
Wants more.

05:48.194 --> 05:49.075
Wants more.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.600
What's my place?

06:18.450 --> 06:20.846
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

06:20.866 --> 06:22.046
We got it that time.

06:22.346 --> 06:25.848
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:25.888 --> 06:28.169
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

06:28.189 --> 06:30.930
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

06:31.050 --> 06:34.271
I wonder if the ruffians think we're fighting or something, huh?

06:35.327 --> 06:36.948
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

06:36.968 --> 06:39.850
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

06:39.870 --> 06:42.992
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

06:43.052 --> 06:43.873
BAU BAU BAU!

07:05.847 --> 07:06.228
Yeah.

07:06.808 --> 07:07.948
It's the start of a new week.

07:08.249 --> 07:10.390
You have to start it silly, right?

07:10.730 --> 07:14.092
Maybe instead of starting on the right paw, this time it's the silly paw.

07:14.392 --> 07:14.892
Maybe?

07:15.292 --> 07:15.732
Maybe?

07:15.792 --> 07:20.155
Well... Ruffians... BAU BAU!

07:20.255 --> 07:22.956
BAU BAU!

07:23.036 --> 07:27.378
Well, I sure hope there's no first time ruffians joining us today.

07:27.398 --> 07:30.200
But... Maybe there is?

07:31.317 --> 07:32.538
So I'll explain!

07:32.878 --> 07:38.521
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.801
AKA FUWAMOCO!

07:40.101 --> 07:43.003
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

07:43.303 --> 07:49.086
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:49.126 --> 07:50.227
Maybe not the silly paw.

07:50.347 --> 07:50.567
Yeah.

07:51.427 --> 07:57.270
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.492
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

08:01.552 --> 08:02.852
BAU BAU!

08:02.952 --> 08:04.833
No more silly stuff!

08:05.834 --> 08:06.474
No more silly stuff!

08:06.494 --> 08:08.795
I don't know, I think there's a lot more silly to come still.

08:13.736 --> 08:15.558
Have we been seeing Pero recently?

08:15.638 --> 08:18.801
We haven't seen Pero, but some ruffians have seen Pero.

08:19.162 --> 08:20.683
So let's take a look!

08:21.184 --> 08:21.944
De-den!

08:21.964 --> 08:24.747
Nice hat.

08:25.328 --> 08:26.849
Pero's back at the job site.

08:27.770 --> 08:35.798
It seems like Pero might have gotten a bit bored with his daily life and decided to get his hands dirty and work at a steel shop.

08:35.818 --> 08:36.359
Dangerous.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.179
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

09:00.104 --> 09:01.965
We're glad to hear that Pero helped you out.

09:01.985 --> 09:02.845
That was really nice of him!

09:02.905 --> 09:05.485
Are you sure he wasn't just doing it because he was told to do it?

09:21.468 --> 09:24.851
But maybe, maybe Pero liked the experience with the forklift.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.253
You know, that one time.

09:26.273 --> 09:30.276
So maybe he decided to branch out to a steel shop.

09:31.077 --> 09:32.158
Oh, maybe.

09:32.278 --> 09:33.640
Supervisor Pero!

09:34.420 --> 09:35.461
Maybe not that far.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.484
No, he's... not yet.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.266
He has to work a bit harder first.

09:40.406 --> 09:43.609
Pero's kind of our supervisor if you think about it.

09:44.290 --> 09:44.670
No way.

09:44.690 --> 09:45.891
You don't want him as your supervisor.

09:45.951 --> 09:46.412
No way.

09:48.591 --> 09:53.253
Well, we hope you have safe travels and that there are no bumps on the roads.

09:53.373 --> 09:54.053
No big bumps.

09:54.073 --> 09:54.933
There might be little bumps.

09:55.213 --> 09:55.854
Ah, little bumps.

09:55.874 --> 09:57.054
No big bumps.

09:57.634 --> 09:59.615
BAU BAU!

10:01.916 --> 10:02.836
Now, Ruffians!

10:04.016 --> 10:04.677
Ruffians.

10:04.697 --> 10:05.457
Did you miss it?

10:06.097 --> 10:09.438
Well, you know, sometimes a weekend can be a busy time.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.819
You've got a lot going on.

10:10.839 --> 10:10.899
But...

10:12.526 --> 10:17.089
Yesterday, we had a yummy... No, no, I'm Pero Sighting.

10:17.729 --> 10:23.272
A yummy treat for Ruffians and Adventrix, a Halloween treat!

10:23.392 --> 10:27.854
We had a new song cover come out together!

10:28.335 --> 10:30.056
It's called Halloween Night Tonight.

10:30.756 --> 10:35.559
It's actually our first song cover all together with Abyss!

10:35.999 --> 10:37.760
It might sound a little bit familiar.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.682
That's because it's an English version of our JP-senpai song,

10:42.102 --> 10:43.784
Koyoiwa Halloween Night.

10:44.364 --> 10:45.526
And the lyrics?

10:46.206 --> 10:48.829
The English lyrics are done by Nerissa!

10:48.909 --> 10:51.271
BAU BAU!

10:51.311 --> 10:51.952
BAU BAU!

10:52.012 --> 10:54.695
Yeah, the lyrics are super cute and catchy too.

10:55.175 --> 10:56.617
They're really amazing.

10:56.637 --> 10:57.578
Amazing!

10:58.843 --> 11:00.325
Did you listen, ruffians?

11:01.005 --> 11:01.726
It's good!

11:03.287 --> 11:04.147
Amazing!

11:04.768 --> 11:13.394
You know, there's so many different parts and things being sung during the song, so... It's actually pretty difficult.

11:13.414 --> 11:16.076
I'm thinking it was extra tricky.

11:16.276 --> 11:21.800
Yeah, I think the hardest part for me is the... Because it's trick or treat.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.862
Trick or treat, trick or treat night.

11:23.982 --> 11:25.823
Trick or treat, trick and treat night.

11:26.084 --> 11:26.484
Yeah.

11:26.884 --> 11:29.287
And the rhythm's a bit like... Right?

11:29.347 --> 11:30.568
It's tricky.

11:30.648 --> 11:34.191
It turned out super cute though.

11:34.211 --> 11:34.291
Yeah!

11:34.952 --> 11:36.073
Ruffians liked it.

11:36.093 --> 11:37.294
What was your favorite part?

11:37.795 --> 11:47.304
I saw some ruffians say that they liked the... It is a tongue twister.

11:47.444 --> 11:49.306
It is, it is.

11:49.346 --> 11:50.908
But it was really fun.

11:52.286 --> 11:56.730
We put a lot of fun into our recording.

11:56.990 --> 11:57.871
We did our best.

11:57.991 --> 12:00.954
We tried to put a lot of personality into our voices.

12:00.974 --> 12:07.419
I really really enjoy how everyone in Advent, we all have such different singing voices.

12:07.479 --> 12:10.121
I really like the blend of us all together.

12:10.141 --> 12:13.244
I think it makes our individuality stand out.

12:14.738 --> 12:20.000
We hope that you listen to lots of this crazy howling!

12:20.781 --> 12:23.502
Crazy party night!

12:24.102 --> 12:27.143
If you don't, we'll just take a bite.

12:27.864 --> 12:28.204
A bite.

12:28.684 --> 12:29.044
A what?

12:30.005 --> 12:30.345
A bite.

12:31.265 --> 12:31.965
Ruffians.

12:32.706 --> 12:33.026
A bite.

12:34.299 --> 12:37.121
Please listen, my fans!

12:37.161 --> 12:38.162
Howl of a wing.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.903
BAU-wing.

12:40.804 --> 12:45.168
It's BAU-wing night.

12:45.228 --> 12:52.594
Well, it wasn't just that, but we have something else very exciting too!

12:52.614 --> 12:58.319
We also announced some new merch as part of our Advent Halloween Party!

12:58.679 --> 13:00.160
Advent Apparel!

13:02.501 --> 13:03.401
Thank you, ruffians!

13:03.882 --> 13:05.963
You know we have t-shirts and hoodies!

13:05.983 --> 13:09.184
Not t-shirts.

13:09.364 --> 13:11.065
You know the illustration... What?

13:11.925 --> 13:12.785
Is that spooky BAU BAU?

13:12.885 --> 13:14.366
It's spooky BAU BAU BAU.

13:14.546 --> 13:15.807
I just thought it was a song.

13:17.539 --> 13:18.760
But the illustrations!

13:19.060 --> 13:20.902
They're done by Haiyu, you know what?

13:20.922 --> 13:22.603
Did Kaibutsu too for us!

13:22.643 --> 13:25.725
They're super cool, really spooky.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.666
I look pretty cool, right?

13:27.766 --> 13:31.268
Right, but I feel like Biboo's the most shocking, right?

13:31.508 --> 13:33.630
I've never seen her make that face before.

13:34.911 --> 13:36.211
I don't want to see it often.

13:36.291 --> 13:36.492
Nope.

13:36.932 --> 13:37.192
Nope.

13:37.612 --> 13:38.473
But Ruffians!

13:38.693 --> 13:41.415
When you look at the illustrations, don't you feel a bit like you want to

13:41.815 --> 13:43.776
BAU BAU to the moon!

13:43.796 --> 13:44.737

14:08.630 --> 14:12.051
Yeah, I think it depends on each person, you know?

14:12.071 --> 14:12.431
Yeah, yeah.

14:12.951 --> 14:13.992
But that's pretty fast.

14:14.092 --> 14:15.572
But maybe it'll come pretty fast.

14:15.592 --> 14:16.753
Pretty fast?

14:16.973 --> 14:18.433
Did you order yours, Ruffians?

14:18.653 --> 14:19.053
Did you?

14:19.073 --> 14:21.294
Oh, it says Wednesday.

14:21.374 --> 14:23.035
Wednesday!

14:23.095 --> 14:26.236
So by the next FUWAMOCO Morning, you gotta have it.

14:26.296 --> 14:27.276
Wait, really?

14:28.456 --> 14:29.377
You got yours?

14:29.497 --> 14:30.577
Yes!

14:31.197 --> 14:32.778
What color did you get the hoodie in?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.307
The pebble color?

14:35.327 --> 14:36.589
The pebble color.

14:36.749 --> 14:37.870
Maybe.

14:38.210 --> 14:38.651
Waited!

14:38.731 --> 14:39.632
Waited!

14:39.732 --> 14:42.255
BAU BAU BAU!

14:42.275 --> 14:44.117
Thank you!

14:45.114 --> 14:46.175
Next, FUWAMOCO Morning.

14:46.255 --> 14:48.637
And definitely Halloween, okay?

14:48.697 --> 14:49.938
Definitely Halloween.

14:50.078 --> 14:59.166
You know, even if you're not too much of the costume type person, then maybe you can show off how passionate you are for hololive and advent by wearing it!

14:59.706 --> 15:10.095
Yeah, you know, if you came up to us and maybe asked for like a trick or treat while wearing it, we'd surely give you a treat, right?

15:10.315 --> 15:11.155
Right, Moco-chan?

15:12.316 --> 15:13.537
What are we waiting for?

15:13.637 --> 15:14.078
A treat.

15:16.480 --> 15:16.740
I guess.

15:17.601 --> 15:18.402
I guess.

15:18.562 --> 15:19.122
I guess.

15:19.142 --> 15:20.964
Do you want to tweet, ruffians?

15:24.567 --> 15:26.669
No, I think I'll tweet this time.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.912
BAU BAU!

15:31.433 --> 15:34.756
Lots of exciting Halloween stuff's going on.

15:34.776 --> 15:38.799
And we have some great news.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.441
I don't know.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.823
Ruffians.

15:44.721 --> 15:47.421
The darkness, it continues to spread.

15:49.804 --> 15:53.166
Our lightbulb situation has reached a critical point right now.

15:53.746 --> 15:57.128
And so yesterday, we just couldn't take it anymore.

15:58.369 --> 16:01.030
We need to see some light, get out of the darkness.

16:01.110 --> 16:01.610
It's dark.

16:01.830 --> 16:07.093
Yeah, so we decided to muster up the courage to change one key lightbulb.

16:07.133 --> 16:07.874
We did it!

16:08.154 --> 16:08.634
We did it!

16:08.874 --> 16:09.855
It was good!

16:10.235 --> 16:10.755
Yeah!

16:10.775 --> 16:14.757
We're really happy to have a bit more light back into our lives now.

16:14.777 --> 16:16.078
But... But...

16:19.278 --> 16:28.165
Actually, as soon as we changed that lightbulb, another lightbulb burnt out in our bath.

16:28.465 --> 16:33.389
And you know, it's strange because I'm pretty sure we changed that one quite recently.

16:33.950 --> 16:40.335
But it was sort of flickering strangely for a moment while I was drying my hair, and then suddenly... Dead.

16:40.355 --> 16:42.477
It was just like...

16:45.737 --> 16:49.679
And now we have to bathe in the darkness, ruffians!

16:50.539 --> 16:54.802
And what's worse is that it's a really scary lightbulb to fix.

16:54.882 --> 16:56.883
Probably one of the worst.

16:57.663 --> 17:01.945
I don't want to deal with it, but I also really don't like the darkness too.

17:03.927 --> 17:08.789
I do find it a bit spooky that so many lightbulbs just keep on burning out though.

17:08.889 --> 17:09.470
Right!

17:09.630 --> 17:10.050
Why?

17:10.942 --> 17:12.663
And all around the same time too.

17:12.703 --> 17:13.043
Right!

17:13.383 --> 17:14.483
Soon they'll all be gone.

17:14.683 --> 17:17.884
Yeah, it's not like we leave our lights on all the time.

17:17.904 --> 17:17.944
No!

17:19.225 --> 17:22.266
But... It's nothing scary, right?

17:22.486 --> 17:24.446
Not Halloween spirit.

17:25.387 --> 17:30.728
Hopefully no more lightbulbs decide to die and leave us any further in the darkness.

17:31.069 --> 17:31.509
Yeah.

17:32.429 --> 17:34.950
Hopefully this is just contained to October.

17:35.660 --> 17:38.842
The lights will come back on in November.

17:39.023 --> 17:41.705
The lightbulbs will be like, hey, it's November, I'm fixed!

17:41.725 --> 17:43.346
I was just taking a nap!

17:43.646 --> 17:45.307
I was just napping, just a joke.

17:45.587 --> 17:46.148
It's a prank.

17:46.328 --> 17:47.049
That'll be good.

17:48.009 --> 17:49.550
Which curse did you get?

17:50.051 --> 17:50.831
What do you mean?

17:51.292 --> 17:52.433
It's the lightbulb?

17:52.453 --> 17:53.654
You're silly, ruffians!

17:53.674 --> 17:54.594
The lightbulb curse?

17:54.834 --> 17:56.095
You're silly, okay?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.458
Probably just an electrical thing?

17:59.578 --> 18:00.198
I don't know.

18:01.374 --> 18:04.857
I don't know, I feel like lightbulbs should be a little bit more resilient than this.

18:05.057 --> 18:05.398
Right!

18:05.838 --> 18:06.959
A little bit more brilliant.

18:07.339 --> 18:07.760
Brilliant.

18:08.661 --> 18:10.662
Brilliant and resilient.

18:12.824 --> 18:14.766
I don't know how we're gonna fix this problem.

18:14.926 --> 18:19.050
I don't know.

18:20.211 --> 18:22.933
Ruffians, I have to tell you something.

18:25.315 --> 18:28.238
It might expose Moco-chan, it might expose you a little bit.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.040
It's pretty shocking.

18:32.761 --> 18:33.521
It can't be helped.

18:33.921 --> 18:37.422
I think I need to share this, but I'll say it!

18:37.702 --> 18:38.122
I'll say it!

18:38.142 --> 18:40.223
Ruffians, I'm gonna say it.

18:40.243 --> 18:48.845
The other day, I caught Moco-chan trying to have a cup of tea.

18:49.045 --> 18:49.725
Awful hot.

18:50.325 --> 18:54.127
Yeah, but it was a bit funny looking.

18:59.193 --> 19:02.354
I sorta look like a Rat King!

19:03.334 --> 19:03.874
Like this!

19:04.654 --> 19:05.054
Yeah!

19:05.134 --> 19:06.314
Rat King tee!

19:06.334 --> 19:09.595
Moco-chan, can you explain?

19:10.895 --> 19:12.976
Ruffians, don't give me that look, okay?

19:15.296 --> 19:16.657
Well, you know it!

19:17.057 --> 19:20.097
When you have tea... No!

19:20.477 --> 19:23.578
The first steep is really, really yummy and strong, right?

19:24.577 --> 19:29.279
So, I think most people just sort of toss the teabag out after that.

19:30.220 --> 19:30.520
Right?

19:32.140 --> 19:38.123
But, I feel like it's a waste and that the teabag still has something in it.

19:38.663 --> 19:40.984
So, I don't toss it.

19:41.565 --> 19:44.446
I just, I keep them and dry them out in a separate bowl.

19:44.846 --> 19:48.948
So then, when I have enough of them, I can save them up and then use them.

19:50.393 --> 19:50.773
Again.

19:51.454 --> 19:54.236
And the tea will be strong because it's a lot of tea bags.

19:54.396 --> 19:54.856
Okay.

19:56.037 --> 19:56.597
Why?

19:56.617 --> 19:57.938
It's normal!

19:58.218 --> 19:59.239
It's not normal.

19:59.759 --> 20:01.661
But I guess it's time.

20:01.681 --> 20:04.803
I saved up my tea bags for a while.

20:04.823 --> 20:05.904
Quite a while.

20:05.924 --> 20:07.184
Yeah, you did.

20:07.244 --> 20:08.025
You did that.

20:08.045 --> 20:16.611
I call it Wrecking Tea Ruffians because it had a billion bags of tea with strings dangling out of it.

20:18.168 --> 20:20.850
Moco-chan usually uses a very big teacup.

20:20.930 --> 20:22.151
I like a big teacup.

20:22.692 --> 20:26.014
Even then it was filled to the max with teabags.

20:26.334 --> 20:27.255
Before all the water.

20:27.275 --> 20:28.216
Yeah.

20:28.976 --> 20:30.618
And I stopped her, you know it.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.140
I had to count just how many teabags were in her cup.

20:35.221 --> 20:39.164
Can you guess how many teabag strings were dangling out of it?

20:39.184 --> 20:42.426
This is normal size teabags, okay?

20:42.466 --> 20:42.867
Yeah.

20:44.268 --> 20:44.528
Ten?

20:44.608 --> 20:44.908
No?

20:45.449 --> 20:45.669
No?

20:46.910 --> 20:47.030
No?

20:47.608 --> 20:47.908
Twelve?

20:48.088 --> 20:48.368
Nope.

20:49.789 --> 20:50.049
Nope.

20:52.470 --> 20:52.890
Fifteen?

20:53.010 --> 20:53.450
Almost!

20:54.210 --> 20:55.331
Fourteen!

20:55.451 --> 20:57.552
Fourteen bags of tea!

20:57.632 --> 20:58.872
I saved it for a while.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.393
It was gross.

21:00.413 --> 21:05.775
They were all half-used, but even then, it looked like there was almost no room for liquid.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.096
Moco-chan, why?

21:08.116 --> 21:09.836
Just toss them away!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.137
I don't want to waste them!

21:11.337 --> 21:12.157
It's a waste!

21:12.937 --> 21:13.658
It's gross.

21:13.778 --> 21:15.458
I know, we are right ruffians.

21:15.538 --> 21:16.699
This is fine.

21:18.339 --> 21:19.019
Were they mold?

21:19.079 --> 21:23.200
Yeah, yeah, two weeks worth of them.

21:23.260 --> 21:29.641
Yes, definitely only two weeks.

21:29.681 --> 21:30.401
Not mold!

21:30.421 --> 21:32.362
They dry out!

21:32.482 --> 21:34.562
If they dry out, then it's fine!

21:34.582 --> 21:36.062
It's not moldy!

21:36.142 --> 21:37.723
Who's teabags mold?

21:37.743 --> 21:39.103
That's weird.

21:40.863 --> 21:42.704
They're just teabags in water.

21:43.044 --> 21:45.084
They're not gonna mold, they just dry out.

21:46.877 --> 21:49.299
I'm not putting milk on them or anything like that.

21:49.319 --> 21:51.541
I don't know.

21:52.081 --> 21:53.723
It's not weird, this is normal.

21:53.823 --> 21:55.664
I'm being resourceful, okay?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.125
Resourceful!

21:58.847 --> 22:01.209
Do noga friends do this?

22:01.249 --> 22:01.969
Maybe not.

22:02.170 --> 22:12.578
FUWAMOCO-chan, maybe... I want to reappear into the Wraking T. I've done it too!

22:12.918 --> 22:14.680
I'm gonna continue doing it, okay?

22:14.720 --> 22:15.641
It's resourceful.

22:17.014 --> 22:18.214
At least you have one friend.

22:18.274 --> 22:19.654
Jonathan's your one friend.

22:20.935 --> 22:21.495
Thank you!

22:21.895 --> 22:23.575
Thank you for being on my side!

22:23.635 --> 22:24.695
Okay, Jonathan?

22:24.715 --> 22:26.776
Thank you!

22:27.516 --> 22:33.397
Well... You still like me, right, Ruffians?

22:36.938 --> 22:37.278
Right.

22:40.958 --> 22:43.479
I like to say that things are gonna get a bit better.

22:44.699 --> 22:44.919
What?

22:46.804 --> 22:52.429
Ruffians, there's something... There's a misunderstanding.

22:52.489 --> 22:52.769
Yeah.

22:54.110 --> 22:56.812
Yeah.

22:56.872 --> 23:01.376
You know the other day, we played the convenience store, right?

23:01.396 --> 23:02.056
Right, right!

23:02.096 --> 23:04.038
And after that, something funny happened.

23:05.419 --> 23:06.420
Ruffians!

23:06.960 --> 23:08.582
You started a hug pile!

23:09.002 --> 23:09.542
Silly.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.163
What?

23:10.623 --> 23:11.104
Silly!

23:12.093 --> 23:12.994
The ruffians.

23:13.114 --> 23:13.655
Why?

23:14.897 --> 23:17.420
Well, it went on for over 30 minutes.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.061
Right!

23:18.081 --> 23:18.742
On top of that.

23:18.822 --> 23:19.663
On top of that.

23:19.683 --> 23:20.624
How long was it?

23:20.704 --> 23:22.366
I think... I don't know.

23:22.386 --> 23:23.848
It wasn't an hour, was it?

23:24.609 --> 23:25.410
It was fun.

23:25.430 --> 23:26.031
It was fun.

23:26.051 --> 23:28.134
You enjoyed the dog pile.

23:28.254 --> 23:29.075
It was fun.

23:31.721 --> 23:32.021
What?

23:32.401 --> 23:36.242
You missed the ruffians hug play for 40 minutes?

23:36.262 --> 23:36.562
44 minutes?

23:36.622 --> 23:37.242
Exactly.

23:37.342 --> 23:39.163
Wow.

23:39.983 --> 23:48.345
But on top of that, it didn't just stop at hugging, really.

23:50.065 --> 23:50.325
No.

23:51.446 --> 23:51.546
No.

23:54.948 --> 24:12.977
Some ruffians might think that us, FUWAMOCO, that we're particularly fond of kisses on the paw, but that's... That's too bold, ruffians!

24:13.698 --> 24:15.479
It makes us embarrassed, okay?

24:17.222 --> 24:19.642
You're gonna break our brains like that, okay?

24:19.682 --> 24:26.244
You can't just be like Oscar from Rose of Versailles or some other suave shoujo manga sweetheart, okay?

24:26.904 --> 24:27.444
It's too much.

24:27.464 --> 24:28.084
It's too much.

24:28.164 --> 24:28.724
It's too much.

24:28.764 --> 24:31.465
You'll make them blush too much.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.485
Ruffians.

24:35.245 --> 24:35.825
Head pat.

24:36.066 --> 24:36.326
Yes.

24:37.106 --> 24:38.586
But no touching the ears, okay?

24:38.846 --> 24:39.686
No, no, no.

24:39.986 --> 24:41.006
No touching the tail.

24:41.106 --> 24:41.687
Got it.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.007
Tummy rubs, tummy rubs.

24:44.554 --> 24:47.678
When it's scary and my tummy hurts, I guess.

24:48.058 --> 24:48.479
Maybe.

24:48.499 --> 24:58.050
But, you know, a hug pile doesn't hurt anyone, but... Kisses on the paw.

25:00.470 --> 25:09.514
It's Monday!

25:09.774 --> 25:10.354
It's Monday!

25:10.414 --> 25:11.675
Ruffians, it's Monday!

25:11.695 --> 25:13.875
And that means it's a new week!

25:14.396 --> 25:14.856
A new week!

25:17.204 --> 25:17.844
It's Monday.

25:18.285 --> 25:19.606
It's time!

25:20.186 --> 25:21.247
Moco-chan!

25:21.667 --> 25:24.509
You know, it's time to challenge something new.

25:25.030 --> 25:33.536
I was thinking, the ruffians, they don't necessarily need to challenge Naito, but if they want something extra challenging, they could challenge a haunted house.

25:33.977 --> 25:35.778
You know, make yourself stronger that way.

25:38.479 --> 25:44.764
Moco-chan, I was wondering, would you prefer to go through a haunted house or try a natto?

25:46.046 --> 25:46.306
Huh?

25:47.987 --> 25:48.468
Natto.

25:49.188 --> 25:49.408
Yeah.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.450
I feel like there's more benefits overall.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.111
Right, right.

25:52.251 --> 25:57.636
You know, good health benefits, whereas a haunted house would likely give me a heart attack.

25:58.336 --> 25:58.636
Yeah.

25:59.397 --> 25:59.697
Yeah.

26:00.038 --> 26:05.342
And well, Moco-chan's gonna do her best to give the ruffians some inspiration today, but...

26:06.471 --> 26:07.712
Eating more natto!

26:08.352 --> 26:08.712
Eating it.

26:08.832 --> 26:11.813
I say by eating more natto, but we're still at the starting point.

26:12.594 --> 26:13.414
That's okay!

26:14.355 --> 26:20.797
Well, despite being at the starting point, today is Moco-chan's seventh time trying to eat it on FUWAMOCO Morning.

26:21.298 --> 26:25.900
And I'm kind of starting to feel like maybe I should stop counting because it's just getting embarrassing.

26:25.940 --> 26:26.240
But!

26:26.560 --> 26:26.760
But!

26:27.040 --> 26:34.103
But for ruffians that maybe don't know what natto is, natto is a common breakfast food in Japan and it's made of fermented soybeans.

26:34.584 --> 26:34.764
But...

26:35.824 --> 26:42.348
It's a bit sticky, it's a bit slimy, a bit strong smelling, but it's really healthy for you.

26:43.109 --> 26:48.212
And you know, so Moco-chan, you're going to conquer your fear, your dislike for it.

26:48.232 --> 26:48.793
My fear?

26:49.113 --> 26:50.214
I don't think I fear it.

26:50.394 --> 26:51.314
I'm just not good with it.

26:51.334 --> 26:53.576
I don't know, but... Today is the day!

26:53.616 --> 27:01.261
This way you can, you know, protect the ruffian smile for many, many years to come and be a bit stronger like your older sister, right?

27:01.741 --> 27:02.181
Today!

27:04.073 --> 27:05.675
Today!

27:05.835 --> 27:07.917
How is your confidence today, Moco-chan?

27:08.297 --> 27:14.142
I... I had a lot of... I had a lot of nightmares last night.

27:14.162 --> 27:16.905
So, I don't feel the best.

27:17.325 --> 27:20.949
But, I feel... Like I wanna do it.

27:21.209 --> 27:21.569
Why?

27:22.490 --> 27:26.233
Because the dreams were scary, so now you're like... I'm gonna eat it!

27:26.474 --> 27:27.955
I'll do it for the ruffians.

27:28.455 --> 27:28.836
I feel...

27:29.693 --> 27:33.194
I feel like I'm gonna do my best, even though I had bad dreams.

27:33.654 --> 27:36.915
Well, today... Can you actually eat it?

27:37.555 --> 27:38.335
I'm gonna try.

27:38.355 --> 27:39.516
Consume it!

27:39.536 --> 27:41.716
I have a bunch of tissues, but I swear to feel!

27:41.816 --> 27:43.777
Like, maybe.

27:43.997 --> 27:44.237
Huh?

27:44.357 --> 27:44.597
Maybe.

27:45.557 --> 27:46.517
I can do it.

27:46.558 --> 27:47.658
I don't need the tissues.

27:48.838 --> 27:51.639
We properly received the nutrients today, finally!

27:54.352 --> 27:55.013
I can't tell yet.

27:55.033 --> 27:55.493
Please do it.

27:55.853 --> 27:56.674
Please do it.

27:56.774 --> 27:57.655
Okay, Moco-chan!

27:58.115 --> 28:02.859
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard to make this.

28:03.119 --> 28:04.020
Thank you!

28:05.121 --> 28:05.902
It's all ready!

28:05.922 --> 28:09.645
Moco-chan took it with confidence, I feel like, this time.

28:10.005 --> 28:11.827
I did, but now I'm doubting myself.

28:16.776 --> 28:18.256
I received the Bacillus.

28:18.997 --> 28:19.797
What?!

28:21.737 --> 28:23.158
Thank you for the hemp pints!

28:24.038 --> 28:25.478
I guess you can use that now, huh?

28:25.498 --> 28:28.359
Oh, it's so sticky.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.220
It looks particularly yummy today.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.641
It looks... What was that?

28:35.741 --> 28:37.901
I got hit in the face with the smell.

28:39.002 --> 28:39.702
It's like a wall.

28:39.722 --> 28:41.502
I didn't stir it up too much.

28:41.522 --> 28:42.142
You didn't, you didn't.

28:42.162 --> 28:43.543
It's only half fluffy.

28:43.563 --> 28:44.803
Only half fluffy.

28:47.300 --> 28:54.042
I'm looking for a not very fluffy, sticky, slimy one, but I feel like I'm not choosing the best.

28:54.102 --> 28:54.823
They still are.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.263
Pick two, Moco-chan.

28:56.283 --> 28:57.243
No, I'm going to try four.

28:57.263 --> 29:04.926
Actually, you should try four because we're going to be collabing with Fubuki-senpai and Poruru-oneechan, right?

29:05.546 --> 29:07.066
But I'm going to do my best today.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.407
I had a lot of nightmares.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.434
So I woke up early early.

29:11.454 --> 29:14.798
Because I figured, I had nightmares.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.921
If I go back to sleep, I'm going to have more nightmares.

29:16.941 --> 29:21.005
So I'm just going to wake up early and do stuff.

29:21.025 --> 29:21.826
A little sister?

29:22.066 --> 29:23.808
You know what would be even a better little sister?

29:24.008 --> 29:24.249
What?

29:24.449 --> 29:25.570
If you ate your natto.

29:26.531 --> 29:27.492
Eat your natto, okay?

29:27.512 --> 29:28.732
Okay, I'm gonna try, okay?

29:29.913 --> 29:30.913
I don't need a countdown.

29:30.973 --> 29:31.914
It'll be okay without it.

29:32.034 --> 29:33.314
I'm gonna do it without it, okay?

29:33.535 --> 29:34.115
Gross!

29:34.195 --> 29:35.095
I'm gonna do it without it.

29:35.175 --> 29:37.076
Moco-chan, you're growing!

29:37.096 --> 29:39.437
Today, my plan is to chew it.

29:39.457 --> 29:40.618
Okay?

29:41.098 --> 29:43.259
I'm gonna chew it in the molars.

29:44.280 --> 29:47.481
Okay, that's my decision.

29:47.501 --> 29:48.522
With the cane eyes!

29:49.494 --> 29:51.836
I'm not gonna say anything, I'm just focused.

29:52.957 --> 29:53.737
Okay, focus.

29:53.777 --> 29:54.077
I'm waiting.

29:54.098 --> 29:54.278
Do it!

30:20.064 --> 30:20.805
Oh, oh, she did it!

30:21.045 --> 30:21.565
She did it!

30:21.925 --> 30:23.326
Oh, I don't see the fear.

30:23.346 --> 30:25.508
Oh, it's going well.

30:25.528 --> 30:28.630
Oh, oh, the face is only a little bit sad.

30:31.572 --> 30:31.872
I did it.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.653
She did it!

30:33.753 --> 30:34.534
Ruffians!

30:34.614 --> 30:39.437
Moco-chan, Moco-chan, show me your tummy.

30:40.137 --> 30:41.398
Ruffians!

30:41.438 --> 30:44.200
My sister ate the natto!

30:44.260 --> 30:45.120
I need the water!

30:46.321 --> 30:47.142
One bean.

30:47.782 --> 30:49.203
One bean, you ate it!

30:49.423 --> 30:50.344
Okay, next bean.

30:51.024 --> 30:51.925
Next bean.

30:52.645 --> 30:55.687
The seventh time and Moco-chan finally did it!

30:56.228 --> 30:57.549
Now do a second one, right?

30:57.589 --> 30:58.710
Second one, second time.

30:59.170 --> 31:01.331
I'm getting used to the taste on my molar.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.652
It worked.

31:04.477 --> 31:04.938
It worked.

31:04.998 --> 31:07.600
Maybe nightmares... Nightmares is the key.

31:08.281 --> 31:09.322
I did it, okay?

31:09.422 --> 31:13.527
Even though I had nightmares.

31:13.787 --> 31:14.308
Okay.

31:14.328 --> 31:16.029
You can do it too, ruffians, okay?

31:16.049 --> 31:17.451
You're inspired now.

31:18.612 --> 31:20.414
Moco-chan, you should try another.

31:20.935 --> 31:21.956
Try another.

31:22.336 --> 31:23.197
You can do it.

31:23.517 --> 31:24.338
You can do it.

31:25.499 --> 31:26.460
You're strong!

31:26.520 --> 31:27.981
No, a strong goat!

31:28.141 --> 31:29.782
I did one, next time I'll do two.

31:30.402 --> 31:32.183
Next time I'll do two, you'll eat it.

31:32.283 --> 31:34.285
I want the ruffians to leave inspired, okay?

31:34.305 --> 31:35.706
Do you feel powerful?

31:36.486 --> 31:37.266
What's your thoughts?

31:38.307 --> 31:40.048
Maybe I'm getting used to the taste.

31:41.269 --> 31:42.049
Can you feel it?

31:43.851 --> 31:45.291
I noticed it in your tummy.

31:45.992 --> 31:46.973
My tummy hurt a bit.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.467
Wait, I'm getting used to it, maybe.

31:51.487 --> 31:53.629
Good job, Moco-chan!

31:53.689 --> 31:56.770
That was a really, really good attempt.

31:57.331 --> 31:58.051
Next time!

31:58.071 --> 32:00.452
Definitely, too, if not before.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.074
But, Ruffians, let's remember to...

32:03.994 --> 32:07.635
Remember Moco-chan's best attempt to eat the natto today?

32:07.655 --> 32:09.635
Which is today, my best attempt, right?

32:09.675 --> 32:11.116
Getting stronger, right?

32:11.696 --> 32:14.716
Let's use that to power ourselves through the rest of the week.

32:15.197 --> 32:18.937
BAU BAU!

32:19.918 --> 32:23.158
Now for our Doggie of the Day!

32:24.399 --> 32:29.880
Today's Doggie of the Day is... DoDo the Husky!

32:32.128 --> 32:33.748
She's a cutie!

32:34.168 --> 32:36.389
She's very cute, very dramatic.

32:37.129 --> 32:39.210
She likes to make a lot of funny expressions.

32:39.230 --> 32:40.550
I like her sort of side eye.

32:40.730 --> 32:43.231
When you're taking a photo of her.

32:43.271 --> 32:49.093
But yeah, we can definitely see she likes the funny expressions.

32:50.914 --> 32:51.314
She's cute.

32:51.334 --> 32:51.894
She's fluffy.

32:51.914 --> 32:53.535
She looks very fuzzy.

32:53.855 --> 32:56.517
In between the ears is very fuzzy.

32:56.957 --> 33:00.859
But, you know, she does look a little bit grumpy here on the floor, right?

33:01.160 --> 33:03.561
Moco-chan, why do you think she could be pouting?

33:03.961 --> 33:05.502
Maybe it's chilly on the floor.

33:05.682 --> 33:06.543
Chilly?

33:06.883 --> 33:08.664
Maybe she'd rather be on your lap.

33:08.684 --> 33:10.925
But she's not small.

33:11.506 --> 33:12.986
No, she's not gonna fit there.

33:13.367 --> 33:13.727
I don't know.

33:13.767 --> 33:15.748
I was thinking that maybe Dodo ate a shoe.

33:15.848 --> 33:17.289
Or in trouble.

33:19.031 --> 33:19.472
Never!

33:19.812 --> 33:20.332
Never!

33:21.093 --> 33:21.594
She's good.

33:21.854 --> 33:25.958
How does Dordo BAU BAU?

33:26.078 --> 33:28.300
A big husky BAU BAU?

33:28.440 --> 33:40.272
I guess like... Just like that, I'm sure.

33:40.813 --> 33:41.453
I'm sure.

33:43.078 --> 33:45.240
Good singing, huh?

33:45.620 --> 33:46.761
Ups and downs, right?

33:47.281 --> 33:53.606
Yeah, just like you said, Dodo has ups and downs, you know?

33:53.666 --> 33:54.787
Everyone does, right?

33:54.827 --> 33:57.548
She keeps us entertained with her silly expressions though!

33:57.949 --> 34:03.773
And because she's so emotive, it's easy to tell just by looking at her how much she loves them.

34:04.153 --> 34:04.413
BAU BAU!

34:28.410 --> 34:29.770
We have another.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.911
Today I went on a walk.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.751
Why did this ruffian go for a walk?

34:34.112 --> 34:34.772
Let's see.

34:35.432 --> 34:38.213
De-den!

34:39.313 --> 34:40.213
A good snack.

34:40.273 --> 34:41.554
This ruffian is in Japan.

34:41.594 --> 34:47.155
Decided to stop by Miso-do for the first part of the day.

34:47.175 --> 34:48.075
What does it say there?

34:49.516 --> 34:53.577
Not sure if it's as good as advertised by the demon dogs.

34:57.118 --> 34:57.438
Hi!

34:59.102 --> 34:59.983
Excuse me!

35:00.063 --> 35:03.424
What are you talking about, huh?

35:04.445 --> 35:06.326
It's a pondering, okay?

35:06.646 --> 35:08.587
A pondering!

35:08.807 --> 35:10.528
What do you mean by not good?

35:11.989 --> 35:12.749
It's delicious.

35:13.449 --> 35:14.210
It's stretchy.

35:14.690 --> 35:15.891
It's fluffy and fuzzy.

35:16.351 --> 35:18.132
It's perfectly sweet.

35:19.252 --> 35:23.174
You know, maybe it's just that your taste buds are broken.

35:23.254 --> 35:23.975
Huh, ruffian?

35:26.969 --> 35:28.130
Maybe you're the problem.

35:29.330 --> 35:32.272
But, you know, it's good that you got out.

35:32.732 --> 35:39.877
I would say that I hope you enjoyed your walk more than the pondering, but that's pretty hard competition.

35:39.897 --> 35:41.037
That's pretty rude, huh?

35:41.057 --> 35:43.979
Yeah, pondering's are just too good, you know.

35:44.759 --> 35:52.464
But, maybe, maybe soon things will be a bit better and your taste buds will be fixed soon.

35:52.704 --> 35:53.845
Let's hope for that, okay?

35:54.946 --> 35:56.349
Enjoy Japan!

35:56.449 --> 35:58.053
BAU BAU!

35:58.153 --> 35:58.734
BAU BAU!

36:05.463 --> 36:11.326
For our question of the day, we have... Hi FUWAMOCO!

36:11.886 --> 36:12.546
Hello!

36:12.886 --> 36:17.508
In the first Resident Evil scene, Mococo mentions you could hear noises coming from everywhere.

36:17.528 --> 36:22.370
Does that mean Fuwawa and Mococo use separate headphones or earphones when streaming?

36:22.911 --> 36:25.072
How do you set something like that up?

36:25.532 --> 36:32.695
I think for Resident Evil, I can hear things from everywhere because it's coming from everywhere and I'm very scared.

36:33.215 --> 36:40.157
Yeah, maybe it's a little Moco-chan kind of thing, but I've actually seen a number of ruffians asking this question.

36:41.338 --> 36:46.379
Well, a quick answer is that we do use separate headphones.

36:46.399 --> 36:53.121
Moco-chan's ears are shorter and rounder than mine, and mine are bigger and taller, right?

36:53.181 --> 36:54.042
It's a bit different.

36:54.062 --> 36:57.883
Yeah, it's kind of hard to share headphones or earbuds.

36:57.943 --> 37:00.704
Sometimes we do, but not in this case.

37:01.744 --> 37:01.824
Nooo!

37:17.347 --> 37:23.292
Yeah, like we said, it's a bit different, especially I guess, compared to all of Advent at least.

37:37.905 --> 37:44.091
But you know, it's a really strong and powerful sound, so we want to learn how to master it, but... Yeah!

37:44.491 --> 37:47.554
I don't know, I think that we've done a pretty good job so far.

37:47.634 --> 37:48.575
Pretty good, yeah.

37:48.615 --> 37:50.297
You know, tech stuff is difficult.

37:50.397 --> 37:51.498
It's difficult.

37:51.578 --> 37:55.441
Sometimes I need to give it a little bit of a... BAU BAU BAU BAU!

37:55.501 --> 37:58.284
Yeah, so... Deserves it sometimes.

38:00.265 --> 38:00.786
BAU BAU!

38:16.840 --> 38:22.702
And for our next stream, there's always a next stream right around the corner.

38:39.429 --> 38:42.230
This time, we have... De-den!

38:42.710 --> 38:46.231
We have a collab together with Fubuki-senpai and Pororo-chan!

38:46.271 --> 38:46.591
Yeah!

38:46.791 --> 38:49.111
And we're going ghost hunting in 5-4-4-3!

38:49.131 --> 38:51.632
Like we mentioned just before.

38:51.772 --> 38:51.972
Yeah.

38:52.112 --> 38:52.332
Alright.

38:52.352 --> 38:57.593
You know, Fubuki-senpai was so brave and strong when she showed us through the back rooms, right?

38:57.633 --> 38:58.974
Showed us through the back rooms.

38:59.174 --> 39:05.875
Kind of like showing us through the... But, I think she's probably pretty strong at ghost hunting too.

39:06.635 --> 39:08.136
Will Fubuki-senpai even scream?

39:09.356 --> 39:14.058
I don't think so.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.941
I've sneezed already over 15 times this morning.

39:20.261 --> 39:20.621
She has.

39:21.081 --> 39:26.764
But to continue though, do we think Poruru-oneechan will be a bit scared?

39:27.384 --> 39:29.425
Is she a scaredy cat like us?

39:32.246 --> 39:33.247
It could go either way.

39:34.235 --> 39:38.859
Well, even if she is, you know, I think we gotta show how we're strong.

39:38.879 --> 39:40.581
We're gonna be strong.

39:40.801 --> 39:42.162
Just like yesterday.

39:43.804 --> 39:47.507
Maybe we should try not to hide in the closet so much.

39:47.948 --> 39:52.952
Yeah, because we were definitely very strong during paranormal cleanup, right?

39:53.413 --> 39:53.713
Yeah.

39:55.447 --> 39:59.649
We're gonna make ourselves very proud being like, yeah, this is my kouhai!

40:01.190 --> 40:04.532
Please, please, please, be there for us.

40:05.953 --> 40:08.574
BAU BAU!

40:08.774 --> 40:10.455
And our schedule!

40:11.376 --> 40:13.176
It's a busy, busy week.

40:13.317 --> 40:18.199
And we have a bunch of exciting collabs this week as we approach Halloween.

40:18.579 --> 40:19.039
Fuki.

40:19.240 --> 40:20.360
Fuki times.

40:22.021 --> 40:23.442
But we're gonna be finishing off

40:24.380 --> 40:26.781
Home Sweet Home with Bijou on Saturday!

40:26.801 --> 40:27.201
Hopefully!

40:27.221 --> 40:28.222
What was that pause?

40:28.242 --> 40:30.543
It was a hopeful pause.

40:31.063 --> 40:31.903
Really it wasn't.

40:32.123 --> 40:33.884
You think of how scary it was.

40:34.324 --> 40:35.405
Hopefully.

40:35.765 --> 40:37.065
We'll be finishing it.

40:37.405 --> 40:41.487
So please come and help us get past all the spooky tiger wisdom.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.808
Rescue our cute wife Jane!

40:43.828 --> 40:44.348
Jane!

40:44.448 --> 40:46.589
I want to save Jane!

40:46.689 --> 40:47.190
Jane!

40:47.590 --> 40:50.051
I feel like we're so close to solving the mystery.

40:50.851 --> 40:51.411
I can feel it.

40:51.792 --> 40:52.892
I can feel it, ruffians.

40:53.173 --> 40:56.615
BAU BAU!

40:57.515 --> 41:02.118
Thank you so much, ruffians, for joining us today for a very silly FUWAMOCO Morning.

41:02.399 --> 41:03.900
A very celebratory one.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.520
Celebratory!

41:04.540 --> 41:07.862
Moco-chan, finally, you finally ate your first natto bean.

41:07.922 --> 41:08.903
I've eaten one before.

41:08.943 --> 41:10.644
I don't know.

41:10.684 --> 41:11.765
This was the first time, no?

41:11.865 --> 41:12.085
No!

41:12.105 --> 41:14.226
I did it for Poruru-oneechan.

41:14.306 --> 41:14.587
Really?

41:14.647 --> 41:16.728
I feel like every time it's always in the tissue.

41:16.748 --> 41:18.029
No, this was my second time.

41:18.989 --> 41:19.670
Is it ruffians?

41:20.129 --> 41:21.289
Ruffians, you know, right?

41:21.930 --> 41:23.090
Seiken Naito.

41:24.310 --> 41:24.810
Thank you.

41:25.531 --> 41:27.031
I forgot.

41:27.271 --> 41:27.811
Thank you.

41:27.831 --> 41:38.235
Well, ruffians, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special ruffians today!

42:22.058 --> 42:23.798
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

42:23.838 --> 42:25.119
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

42:25.299 --> 42:25.499

42:25.519 --> 42:25.779

I almost did the same thing as you did at the beginning, huh?

What?

42:32.701 --> 42:33.241
