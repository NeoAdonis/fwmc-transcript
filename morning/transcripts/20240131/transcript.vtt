00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.384
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:19.389
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.891
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:30.187
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:32.969
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.051
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.252
BAU BAU!

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:44.136
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:45.557
Ruffians!

00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:48.899
Do you see what episode it is today?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.743
Ruffians!

00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:02.308
It's 75!

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:03.228
My episode 75!

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.650
Thank you for joining us for our 75th episode!

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.631
BAU BAU!

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:13.634
I'm a little cold this morning.

00:06:13.654 --> 00:06:14.394
You good.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.975
BAU BAU.

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:27.537
Sometimes, you know, all you can do is just BAU it out.

00:06:30.218 --> 00:06:32.459
BAU BAU!

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.080
You're good!

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.302
All you can do is just BAU it out, Ruffians.

00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:41.903
Some days, you'll have mornings like that.

00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:45.445
Where you just, you roll out of bed, but you're still a bit chilly.

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:48.166
The bones quite aren't warmed up high.

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:50.067
Someone needs stretches.

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:53.243
Don't we all need stretchy paws?

00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:58.588
But more importantly, it's episode 75!

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:15.662
I remember it was just episode 50 the other day, and well, you know, things were a little bit rough, but Ruffians were really happy to be able to celebrate and have our episode 75 today with you!

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:17.083
Right around

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:19.385
Our 6 month anniversary!

00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:21.347
It worked perfectly!

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:24.250
Math is crazy!

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:24.991
Right!

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:32.899
Well you know, FUWAMOCO Morning has now been around for 6 months!

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.284
But there might be some Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today!

00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:38.545
I saw some of you!

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:39.446
I saw!

00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:47.814
Well, to explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:47.954 --> 00:07:48.475
A.K.A.

00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:49.456
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:52.139
And it's hosted by us!

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:54.781
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:56.343
BAU BAU!

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:02.165
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:08.167
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:12.529
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:15.130
BAU BAU!

00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:22.113
Ruffians, you always say hashtag, hashtag, but do you remember what the hashtag is?

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.180
I'm concerned.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.162
This is a very good question.

00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:31.646
But you know, after a bit of stretches, maybe you're feeling a bit more warmed up now.

00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:33.387
I'm feeling a bit warmed up.

00:08:33.487 --> 00:08:36.510
Hopefully you are as well, Ruffians.

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:40.513
But remember, sometimes you just gotta BAU it out.

00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:43.375
BAU it out hard.

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:47.379
Well, this is another case of BAUing it out.

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:50.301
Well...

00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:57.137
You know, there was another Pero Sighting.

00:08:57.157 --> 00:09:00.118
Just BAU it out.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:01.699
BAU it out.

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:05.001
Well, what did Pero do this time?

00:09:05.021 --> 00:09:05.081
Huh?

00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:06.221
What did he do?

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:08.362
He's always up to something.

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:08.942
Alright.

00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:13.524
Well, the last time you know, picking up duck watching, bird watching is the hardest.

00:09:13.544 --> 00:09:14.425
That was very nice.

00:09:14.645 --> 00:09:15.325
Very nice.

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:16.666
How about this time?

00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:17.186
This time!

00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:19.115
Oh!

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:20.276
Oh!

00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:23.639
Is this the continuation of the hobby?

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:24.820
The continuation?

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.942
First, you know, watching the dogs from a nice distance?

00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:30.998
So many pigeons!

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:32.059
Yeah!

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:33.180
But, but, but!

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.822
You're not scared of them!

00:09:34.862 --> 00:09:35.903
You're so close!

00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:37.144
Look at the one in the right!

00:09:37.164 --> 00:09:38.805
Right there, he's like, I'm gonna get you!

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:39.286
Right?

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:40.827
He's gonna eat your shoes!

00:09:40.927 --> 00:09:44.571
FUWAMOCO, you know, we just, we just get scared of pigeons!

00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:53.258
We try to walk as far away as possible from them because, you know, Ruffians are just so unpredictable!

00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:53.439
You know?

00:09:55.402 --> 00:09:59.846
I don't know, maybe that's why Pero's trying to fit in with them.

00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:03.870
I don't know, they're kind of nasty too, huh?

00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:18.064
Nasty like, you know, because Pero's nasty, but it's not like we strongly dislike pigeons, but it's just, you know, they suddenly, they always like to fly up and surprise you when you're not expecting it.

00:10:20.607 --> 00:10:22.589
No, it's not very nice.

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:23.289
It's not nice.

00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:24.690
I don't want to be surprised.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.852
I don't want it to bump into me or get caught in the fluff.

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:29.734
Land on me.

00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:30.714
Not that cute.

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.296
I'm not expecting that.

00:10:32.896 --> 00:10:36.979
But you know, the cluing is really cute.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.561
You know, it's kind of like cats purring.

00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:40.922
Right.

00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:46.858
All right.

00:10:47.318 --> 00:10:49.159
If only Pero purred, maybe.

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.980
We like him a bit more, huh?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.020
I think so.

00:10:52.601 --> 00:11:01.425
Well, hopefully Pero didn't walk away from that group of pigeons with unsuspecting bird in his tummy.

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:03.846
But you never know!

00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:04.647
You never know.

00:11:05.227 --> 00:11:08.569
Yeah, you know, he's used to leftovers and

00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:12.011
Well... I wouldn't be surprised.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:12.912
Yeah.

00:11:13.192 --> 00:11:13.952
It could happen.

00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:14.612
Yeah.

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:17.908
BAU BAU!

00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:19.531
BAU BAU!

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:21.855
You feel like Pero may be a bird watcher?

00:11:21.955 --> 00:11:27.285
I feel like that too, but now I'm starting to think that maybe this hobby wasn't what we kind of were thinking it was.

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.950
Maybe it's more like a... Sinister.

00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:31.213
A buffet.

00:11:32.094 --> 00:11:34.639
Maybe like a buffet, a sinister buffet.

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:36.062
Yeah.

00:11:37.084 --> 00:11:37.264
Wow!

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:40.459
Ruffians.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.561
You heard yesterday.

00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.661
For sure, definitely.

00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:46.782
I mean, I just kind of mentioned it.

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:46.862
But!

00:11:47.282 --> 00:11:55.466
It's now officially been six months since all of Adam and Damien!

00:11:55.766 --> 00:11:58.467
BAU BAU!

00:11:58.547 --> 00:11:59.968
BAU BAU!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.469
Ruffians!

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:03.610
Can you believe it?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.650
Oh my goodness.

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:06.771
We can't at all.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.672
No.

00:12:09.591 --> 00:12:12.052
We just feel so, so thankful.

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:18.315
You know, so incredibly thankful to have you here supporting us and all of Advent for these past six months.

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:23.077
You know, it really means everything to us.

00:12:24.138 --> 00:12:24.718
I know!

00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:26.859
We've had so much fun!

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:31.421
Lots of laughs and have created so many things together with you Ruffians.

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:34.382
So really, thank you!

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.603
Thank you!

00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:42.436
It's been a really wonderful six months, but you know what to celebrate this time!

00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:43.416
We have this!

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:56.146
Yeah, we had a very silly collab stream all with Albert when we played some more Gliding Fall, but we also announced some special half-year celebration merch as well!

00:12:56.706 --> 00:13:02.090
First, we have a very cool tapestry featuring all of Albert with this design here.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.103
And you know, we also even have cooler metal wanted keychains of each of us.

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:10.264
Wanted keychains.

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.205
In case you heard something different like I did.

00:13:12.566 --> 00:13:13.286
What did I say?

00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:14.907
I said wanted.

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:20.811
I would want you to feel like you want to get the wanted keychain.

00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:26.377
Wait!

00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:28.659
We're not hololive Wanted, okay?

00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:28.939
No.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:29.960
Yeah.

00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:40.867
But, we hope that you'll pick them up from the official hololive store and continue to love Advent as much as you have for these past six months.

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:42.468
But, you confused the Ruffians.

00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:43.389
What?

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:45.210
Ruffians!

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.352
It's been six months, why are you still confused?

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.071
Understandable!

00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:54.292
Understandable.

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:55.172
You're not confused.

00:13:55.312 --> 00:13:55.852
I'm sorry.

00:13:56.653 --> 00:13:58.394
I misunderstood how you felt.

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:00.215
I'm sorry.

00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:03.056
It's a tradition.

00:14:04.017 --> 00:14:07.038
Well... In case you're interested!

00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:08.179
Yeah!

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:15.043
You can pre-order the half-year celebration merchandise up until the beginning of March.

00:14:15.103 --> 00:14:16.724
So you still have some time.

00:14:16.744 --> 00:14:17.824
You still have time.

00:14:18.265 --> 00:14:18.645
Maybe...

00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:21.997
You know, things are a little bit rougher than you expected.

00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:22.997
I didn't want to wait.

00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:24.138
It's okay!

00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:25.359
You have a bit of time.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.041
Yeah.

00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:32.903
But you know, it's been six months.

00:14:33.403 --> 00:14:36.825
You know, we've been doing a bit of reflection.

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:39.547
More than usual recently, because we reflect a lot.

00:14:40.007 --> 00:14:42.528
But, you know, it's been six months.

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.769
I know.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.611
It's been a long time, but a short time.

00:14:48.772 --> 00:14:54.156
And, you know, we're truly excited for everything coming up!

00:14:55.197 --> 00:14:58.599
And just how much we feel that Advent's been fun together.

00:14:58.619 --> 00:14:58.699
Yeah.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:05.124
We're so thankful to be a part of Advent and surrounded by so much talented girls.

00:15:05.344 --> 00:15:05.964
Right!

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:08.926
Such a nice, nice Advent!

00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:10.147
Nice.

00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:11.108
Nice Advent.

00:15:11.648 --> 00:15:12.229
Nice Advent.

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:24.196
We're gonna continue to use all our energy we have and fight just as hard as it took for us to get out of this cell to do even more amazing things in hololive.

00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:29.960
Don't miss it, okay?

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.322
BAU BAU!

00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:37.766
Six months before you know it, it'll be another six months and we'll be at our one year anniversary.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.471
That's crazy.

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.172
Don't think, just jam!

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.554
BAU BAU!

00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:49.018
Well, you know, yesterday was quite a big day.

00:15:49.098 --> 00:16:02.348
Not just because it was Advent's half anniversary, but also because IRyS-senpai, well, she revealed a brand new outfit!

00:16:02.368 --> 00:16:03.929
BAU BAU!

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.191
Did you get a chance to take a look, Ruffians?

00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:07.432
If you didn't look, no!

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:08.859
Look!

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.480
Look!

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.422
But now you know!

00:16:15.902 --> 00:16:28.047
IRyS-senpai has this really super cute gamer cyber inspired outfit with such a cool colorful jacket and some awesome shoes that are not pictured but they're awesome!

00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:30.388
Believe us, they're awesome!

00:16:30.688 --> 00:16:36.030
It can even be dressed down into a really pretty and proper safe outfit as well too!

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.911
And the glasses!

00:16:39.392 --> 00:16:41.753
And the straight down breeches!

00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:43.114
They're really cute!

00:16:43.134 --> 00:16:43.634
I love it.

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:44.775
I love it.

00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:47.957
You know, especially the swirly glasses too.

00:16:48.037 --> 00:16:51.079
Yeah, IRyS-senpai's swirly glasses.

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:52.339
It's so cute, huh?

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:54.581
It's so multifunctional.

00:16:54.941 --> 00:17:02.305
We're really looking forward to seeing IRyS-senpai use this outfit lots and lots for sure in the future, right?

00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:02.645
Right?

00:17:02.705 --> 00:17:03.746
It's so cute!

00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:04.266
Very cute!

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:06.868
Glasses!

00:17:07.648 --> 00:17:08.029
Cute.

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:11.591
I think that, you know, more of us should have glasses.

00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:12.331
Why not?

00:17:13.692 --> 00:17:14.232
Why not?

00:17:14.472 --> 00:17:14.953
Why not?

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:21.256
Well, these Demon Dogs have pretty good eyesight, you know, so... What do you think, Ruffians?

00:17:22.757 --> 00:17:23.597
Glasses.

00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:29.441
No.

00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:32.712
No!

00:17:32.732 --> 00:17:33.453
No, no, no.

00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:34.734
Maybe?

00:17:34.894 --> 00:17:35.494
Maybe?

00:17:36.595 --> 00:17:39.217
Ruffians, what's wrong with glasses?

00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:43.581
I didn't know.

00:17:43.601 --> 00:17:48.104
We like glasses.

00:17:48.144 --> 00:17:50.146
I didn't know you don't like these, Ruffians.

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:53.749
I guess that's concerning, huh?

00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:56.037
Wow.

00:17:56.277 --> 00:18:00.881
A big congratulations on the new outfit to IRyS-senpai!

00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.583
I like IRyS-senpai's glasses!

00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:03.903
Okay!

00:18:04.164 --> 00:18:04.624
BAU BAU!

00:18:04.644 --> 00:18:08.027
BAU BAU!

00:18:08.047 --> 00:18:09.548
So exciting!

00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:09.909
Very cute.

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:13.492
Very very cute.

00:18:19.229 --> 00:18:30.353
Ruffians, actually, we have to say that we're sorry because we have yet another apology to make.

00:18:30.773 --> 00:18:31.913
Another.

00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:32.394
Yeah.

00:18:33.754 --> 00:18:36.795
So many apologies this week, Moco-chan.

00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:38.136
Yeah.

00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:39.436
It's only Wednesday.

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:40.256
Right.

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:43.778
We shouldn't have to apologize after our birthday.

00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:44.618
Right.

00:18:45.478 --> 00:18:47.239
Well, you see,

00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:50.805
We made a mistake today.

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:53.186
One that we've never made before.

00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:54.846
Never ever.

00:18:55.086 --> 00:18:58.647
Maybe it was because we were too excited.

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:02.988
Or maybe because we were too sleepy.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:09.290
Or should I say that we were too sleepy.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:10.690
Sleepy.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.410
Ah well.

00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:26.284
You know, that's because during our watch-along for Watame-senpai's second solo concert, Watame Night Fever, that just happened just a few hours ago.

00:19:26.984 --> 00:19:28.886
Well, we made a mistake.

00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:29.606
We did.

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:31.347
Yeah.

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:32.868
Do you know what it was?

00:19:33.989 --> 00:19:38.992
We completely forgot to introduce ourselves, Ruffians!

00:19:39.632 --> 00:19:40.313
BAU BAU.

00:19:40.373 --> 00:19:42.374
BAU BAU!

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.782
You know, we must've just gotten wrapped up in the BAU BAU DO DO DO DOI!

00:19:47.843 --> 00:19:48.303
Right.

00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:55.587
And we were just too focused on thinking what the concert would be like and I guess, you know, we forgot.

00:19:55.607 --> 00:19:55.687
Yeah.

00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:01.590
So, worst way that any Ruffians came in and got confused.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.490
Oh no.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:02.991
You know.

00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:04.892
Who are these Demon Dogs?

00:20:05.352 --> 00:20:06.192
Who's Fuwawa?

00:20:06.513 --> 00:20:07.473
Who's Mococo?

00:20:07.813 --> 00:20:09.994
I don't know, they didn't introduce themselves.

00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:10.895
Right.

00:20:12.273 --> 00:20:14.735
It's only natural that you will be confused.

00:20:15.395 --> 00:20:17.937
You know, we didn't properly introduce ourselves.

00:20:18.798 --> 00:20:25.302
So, we'll make sure that from now on, we'll do our jobs as professionals!

00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:30.526
And introduce ourselves to you every single time so there's no confusion!

00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:32.687
Let's take this moment to

00:20:35.989 --> 00:20:37.672
Introduce ourselves again.

00:20:38.392 --> 00:20:39.974
One more time!

00:20:40.515 --> 00:20:44.960
Just in case there's some Ruffians who, you know, still aren't sure.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.246
And maybe feel a bit awkward asking.

00:20:49.326 --> 00:20:51.348
Yeah, we wouldn't want them to feel awkward.

00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:52.990
Good idea.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.053
Okay, Ruffians.

00:20:56.565 --> 00:20:57.486
I'm not a chihuahua!

00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.106
I'm Fuwawa!

00:20:58.126 --> 00:20:58.567
I'm not Fuwawa!

00:20:58.647 --> 00:20:59.047
I'm Mococo!

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:12.659
Together we're FUWAMOCO!

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:15.821
BAU BAU!

00:21:16.822 --> 00:21:17.262
Got it.

00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:19.064
No more awkward feelings.

00:21:19.204 --> 00:21:20.345
No confusion.

00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.207
Just some professional puppies right here.

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:24.027
Right here.

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:25.509
That's us!

00:21:26.249 --> 00:21:28.291
BAU BAU!

00:21:31.258 --> 00:21:32.578
Now you recognize us?

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.259
Good!

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:35.499
Good, see?

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.419
Happy to hear it.

00:21:36.499 --> 00:21:40.620
It was important to apologize about something of that magnitude.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.981
You know it's good to apologize.

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.021
Yeah.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:56.144
But, Ruffians, you know, FUWAMOCO, we always are keeping our eyes open, our paws on the post, ears to the...

00:21:57.534 --> 00:21:59.115
To the rocks?

00:21:59.135 --> 00:21:59.735
To the rocks?

00:22:00.516 --> 00:22:01.036
Sure!

00:22:01.836 --> 00:22:17.686
But recently, you know, we've been seeing some mumblings, maybe some mutterings, you know, of those who are confused not just about who's Fuwawa, who's Mococo, but you know, other things.

00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:22.328
You know, same thing like, I thought FUWAMOCO were twins!

00:22:23.069 --> 00:22:24.670
Why are they on different days?

00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:28.483
So they weren't twins after all, huh?

00:22:28.883 --> 00:22:29.143
Yeah.

00:22:30.024 --> 00:22:30.264
Huh?

00:22:31.665 --> 00:22:32.065
Well!

00:22:32.845 --> 00:22:38.648
Just because our birthdays are on different days doesn't make us any less twins.

00:22:38.748 --> 00:22:39.368
Yeah.

00:22:39.848 --> 00:22:40.288
Got it.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:41.009
Yeah.

00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:43.990
We're identical twins, Demon Guard Dogs.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:44.790
Thank you!

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.852
As you may know, Fuwawa's birthday is on February 1st.

00:22:48.892 --> 00:22:49.032
Yeah!

00:22:49.132 --> 00:22:51.373
And mine is February 2nd.

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:51.913
Yeah!

00:22:52.093 --> 00:22:55.095
And you know, this is because it was

00:22:57.519 --> 00:23:00.302
The Blessing of the Moon!

00:23:02.184 --> 00:23:06.469
I don't think FUWAMOCO wants us to talk too much more about things.

00:23:08.757 --> 00:23:09.778
She did her best!

00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:11.499
She did her best!

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:17.723
Yeah, and I was born on the first, and then Moco-chan, you were born on the second.

00:23:17.783 --> 00:23:18.324
Yeah!

00:23:18.504 --> 00:23:21.106
It's just how things work out, you know?

00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:22.106
Yeah.

00:23:22.507 --> 00:23:27.050
Sometimes important things can take a while, so it's not that simple.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.993
It's a little bit of a delicate topic.

00:23:31.033 --> 00:23:31.553
That's true.

00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:31.873
Yeah.

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:38.350
You know, all it means is, you know... MY CELEBRATION!

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.311
Yeah!

00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:41.012
Double the fun time!

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.333
Double!

00:23:42.693 --> 00:23:43.133
Okay.

00:23:43.574 --> 00:23:46.676
But, technically, maybe it's kind of triple though.

00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:56.962
Because we have a birthday countdown party tonight, and then my solo birthday party, and then Moco-chan's solo birthday party too!

00:23:57.222 --> 00:23:57.502
Hai!

00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:02.806
Lots and lots and lots of fun!

00:24:03.166 --> 00:24:05.667
Not just double, maybe triple.

00:24:07.248 --> 00:24:12.151
We really hope that you know you'll be there to celebrate with us.

00:24:12.331 --> 00:24:17.755
Our first ever birthday as hololive members!

00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:21.777
The first time is only ever once, so let's have lots of fun.

00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:23.518
Uh-huh.

00:24:23.818 --> 00:24:29.982
You know, and remember... We're still twins, even if our birthdays are on different days.

00:24:30.182 --> 00:24:30.762
Even if.

00:24:31.263 --> 00:24:31.763
Got it.

00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:33.924
No questions.

00:24:34.404 --> 00:24:35.725
We explained to you.

00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:41.748
Yeah, you don't need to embarrass Mama Puppy more than... Well... How about Pero?

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:44.870
This is our birthday to tell you!

00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:48.092
Our birthdays!

00:24:48.252 --> 00:24:49.833
Don't ask about Pero!

00:24:49.853 --> 00:24:50.493
Okay!

00:24:53.488 --> 00:24:55.890
BAU BAU!

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:05.375
Well, you know, it's the middle of the week, our birthday week.

00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:08.697
And you know, even though there's exciting things coming up.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.539
Well, Ruffians, how are you feeling today?

00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:13.840
Maybe a little cold?

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.642
A little cold, need some stretches.

00:25:17.302 --> 00:25:20.083
Maybe some stretches for the heart.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.332
Moco-chan, do you have anything to help with that?

00:25:26.732 --> 00:25:27.113
Maybe.

00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:33.736
Ruffians!

00:25:35.257 --> 00:25:40.820
How are you feeling today?

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.701
Need some heart stretches?

00:25:44.682 --> 00:25:48.104
Well, first off, do you know what today is?

00:25:54.144 --> 00:25:55.605
Do you know what today is?

00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:00.489
Wednesday.

00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:02.370
Yeah!

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.151
Today is a Wednesday!

00:26:04.912 --> 00:26:09.635
Which means that this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:16.940
And you're gonna hear from me, straight from the Mococo!

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:20.263
Good morning!

00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:24.292
Good morning!

00:26:25.352 --> 00:26:26.032
I see you there.

00:26:27.513 --> 00:26:29.333
You're still a bit sleepy, aren't you, huh?

00:26:30.474 --> 00:26:32.354
Well, that's okay!

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.735
It's time to get up and get going.

00:26:35.155 --> 00:26:39.237
But don't rush yourself too much if you aren't feeling physically up to it, okay?

00:26:40.177 --> 00:26:47.560
It's important to listen to what your body is saying, so... You know, if you're feeling strong, you're feeling strong!

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.620
But sometimes, you're not.

00:26:50.181 --> 00:26:51.141
It changes every day.

00:26:52.108 --> 00:26:53.909
You know, you've been doing your best!

00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:57.430
And sometimes, your best will be more!

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.251
And some days it'll be less!

00:27:00.131 --> 00:27:01.912
But one thing doesn't change, you know.

00:27:03.332 --> 00:27:06.874
And that is, that your best is your best.

00:27:07.474 --> 00:27:09.655
It doesn't have to be the same output every day.

00:27:09.675 --> 00:27:10.755
You know?

00:27:11.476 --> 00:27:15.857
You've been working hard and you should be proud of all that effort, okay?

00:27:16.498 --> 00:27:17.138
Got it!

00:27:18.318 --> 00:27:19.839
Now, today,

00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:26.059
I actually have a very important message for you as well.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.221
So, please listen closely, okay?

00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:39.285
Biboo Biboo, let down your long, long, rock-like hair.

00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:46.669
But if it falls onto me, I will be in my grave earlier than... your mom.

00:27:47.526 --> 00:27:48.887
Loves you very much!

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:51.548
You're doing amazing, beautiful!

00:27:52.008 --> 00:27:53.088
Never give up!

00:27:53.528 --> 00:27:55.049
Ganbatte de!

00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:56.790
This was Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.750
BAU BAU!

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:05.233
That was a weird pup talk, huh?

00:28:05.253 --> 00:28:11.815
I like the part where you mention the Ruffians' mom.

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:12.756
That was pretty nice.

00:28:14.508 --> 00:28:15.088
Inspiring.

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:17.429
Thank you, Moco-chan.

00:28:17.849 --> 00:28:18.549
You're welcome.

00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:21.229
BAU BAU!

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:25.970
Well, let's see who our Doggie of the Day is today!

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.591
We have De-den!

00:28:28.631 --> 00:28:31.991
Today's Doggie of the Day is Milo!

00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:33.632
What a puppy!

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.032
Right?

00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:36.312
Look at those ears!

00:28:40.473 --> 00:28:42.835
Yeah, he hasn't grown into them at all.

00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:44.756
I like his eyebrows.

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.457
His eyebrows!

00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:50.859
Oh, I know, but it looks like he has a case of the helicopter tail.

00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:51.800
Yeah.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.701
Cute!

00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:54.642
Cute!

00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:55.462
Cute!

00:28:56.443 --> 00:29:00.285
And he's going through the chew on the sofa phase too.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:01.466
That happens.

00:29:01.486 --> 00:29:02.486
I remember that.

00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:09.717
Actually, this photo of Milo is from about a month ago.

00:29:09.877 --> 00:29:13.298
Can you imagine how big he is now?

00:29:13.378 --> 00:29:15.738
He's probably as big as two Milos now.

00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:18.499
Probably.

00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:19.099
Right.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.420
How do you think Milo BAU BAU-es?

00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:29.122
Milo now, of today, the two times the size Milo.

00:29:30.182 --> 00:29:32.103
I think it still sounds like

00:29:34.162 --> 00:29:34.662
Really?

00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:37.784
That's Milo of today, Moco-chan.

00:29:37.864 --> 00:29:38.124
Of today?

00:29:38.184 --> 00:29:38.904
You sure?

00:29:39.024 --> 00:29:41.626
I think his barker hasn't really grown.

00:29:42.366 --> 00:29:43.287
That's okay.

00:29:45.048 --> 00:29:46.869
You sure?

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.332
Maybe the Ruffians can get a more accurate Milo.

00:29:54.153 --> 00:29:55.233
A rubber duck.

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.274
He is a puppy.

00:29:57.314 --> 00:29:57.935
He's Milo.

00:29:57.995 --> 00:29:58.755
Not a duck.

00:29:59.155 --> 00:29:59.456
No.

00:29:59.616 --> 00:29:59.976
Got it.

00:30:02.746 --> 00:30:08.507
You know, Milo is a very cute puppy who does all the puppy things.

00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:09.367
All of them.

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:14.049
Yeah, but just make sure that his tail doesn't fly away if he gets too happy, okay?

00:30:14.129 --> 00:30:16.409
You have to keep him grounded, okay?

00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:17.550
He's not a duck.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.170
He can't fly.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:26.332
Actually, you know, naturally as he gets bigger, that helicopter tail, it might slow down.

00:30:26.972 --> 00:30:28.453
But I'll tell you one thing.

00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:35.937
That same amount of crazy happiness will continue to be in his heart whenever he sees you!

00:30:35.997 --> 00:30:38.538
No matter how big he is!

00:30:38.638 --> 00:30:39.359
It won't change.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.861
BAU BAU!

00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:46.603
Very cute!

00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:52.066
And for today I rate on a rock, we have De-den!

00:30:54.527 --> 00:30:56.949
Look at that Fuwawa blue sky!

00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:59.952
Very very FUWAWA Blue High!

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:05.838
Yeah, it looks like such a nice morning run.

00:31:05.878 --> 00:31:09.942
Just a wonderful way to start off your day, right?

00:31:09.982 --> 00:31:12.624
We're glad that you know you're enjoying some time off.

00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:19.533
I'm all for our birthday!

00:31:19.653 --> 00:31:22.574
Thank you!

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:30.818
We're really looking forward to celebrating our birthdays together with you!

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:31.178
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:33.419
It's so pretty.

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:36.860
It really makes you want to go for a nice run, right?

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.221
Perfect weather.

00:31:39.571 --> 00:31:40.632
BAU BAU!

00:31:40.892 --> 00:31:45.135
And for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:46.535
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:47.576
Hello!

00:31:47.696 --> 00:31:48.817
I have a question.

00:31:48.837 --> 00:31:56.562
When you played games together as puppies, did you ever fight over who got to be Player 1 and who had to be Player 2?

00:31:57.002 --> 00:32:02.786
Or did you just go with the classic, the older sibling is always Player 1?

00:32:03.246 --> 00:32:04.167
BAU BAU!

00:32:04.227 --> 00:32:05.107
BAU BAU!

00:32:05.367 --> 00:32:06.308
It's a good question.

00:32:06.648 --> 00:32:07.169
Why?

00:32:07.189 --> 00:32:10.551
I don't think we really ever fought over it.

00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:12.993
Maybe it just sort of came down to feeling.

00:32:13.013 --> 00:32:14.074
Yeah.

00:32:14.634 --> 00:32:20.138
I don't really particularly remember being Player 1 or Moco-chan being Player 2.

00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:20.639
No!

00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:21.119
Huh?

00:32:22.998 --> 00:32:35.688
Yeah, but, you know, as we started to get older, there became a Moco-chan where you'd be the main player, and where I would kind of help, so... Yeah, it just kind of worked out like that naturally.

00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:36.049
Yeah.

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:37.130
No fighting.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:38.731
Just having fun.

00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:39.051
Yeah.

00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:42.874
And you know, that's how things are still to this day, you know?

00:32:43.735 --> 00:32:44.035
Help.

00:32:44.636 --> 00:32:44.856
Help.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:46.177
Help!

00:32:48.058 --> 00:32:48.319
Help!

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:49.840
No yelling.

00:32:53.874 --> 00:32:56.474
I've been training for many years in the way of help.

00:32:57.254 --> 00:32:57.634
BAU BAU!

00:32:57.674 --> 00:33:02.015
Thank you for the questions!

00:33:02.555 --> 00:33:09.577
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for always being a very important part of our FUWAMOCO Mornings.

00:33:09.597 --> 00:33:19.899
Remember, we're still always looking for your doggy of the days, your questions, Pero Sightings, if you happen to see Pero, and the walks that you've been going on too.

00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:22.840
Please let us know!

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:32.963
And also if you have any FUWAMOCO scoops, please report your journalism to us using the hashtag FWMCSCOOP too.

00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:34.984
Thank you so much everyone!

00:33:35.024 --> 00:33:36.345
BAU BAU!

00:33:37.225 --> 00:33:42.170
Wow, our next team, we have De-den!

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.353
It's almost our birthday!

00:33:46.934 --> 00:33:50.717
You know tonight, we have our birthday countdown!

00:33:50.777 --> 00:33:53.820
But tomorrow is Fuwawa's big day!

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.383
And the day after that is Moco-chan's big day!

00:33:58.084 --> 00:34:03.950
So, you know, we hope that you'll join us tonight a bit later than our usual streaming time.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:04.750
A bit.

00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:05.992
A bit later, yeah.

00:34:06.212 --> 00:34:11.957
And then that way, you know, we can spend the first moments of our birthdays together with you!

00:34:12.438 --> 00:34:14.640
BAU BAU!

00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:17.042
And for our schedule!

00:34:19.983 --> 00:34:27.108
On Thursday, and then on Friday, that's when our birthday celebrations are going to happen!

00:34:27.208 --> 00:34:27.488
Yeah!

00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:28.629
On our birthday days.

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:29.569
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:44.359
But, you know, rather than, you know, the usual FUWAMOCO together, it'll give us a little bit more time to be able to express ourselves individually and sing a number of our favorite songs for you just from us.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.380
Individually!

00:34:51.317 --> 00:34:57.560
Well, we have a bunch of things that we want to do together and share with you.

00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:03.083
So we hope that you'll be there for both of our birthday karaoke parties, okay?

00:35:03.103 --> 00:35:08.885
BAU BAU!

00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:10.426
It happens, okay, Ruffians?

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:11.247
It happens!

00:35:11.707 --> 00:35:12.627
Get used to it!

00:35:12.767 --> 00:35:16.669
That's the second time we've synced on the word individual, huh?

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:18.070
I think so.

00:35:18.939 --> 00:35:23.121
Hello Ruffians!

00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:29.604
We want to thank you for joining us today for Episode 75 of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:36.267
Also, you know, it's 6 months anniversary of Advent's FUWAMOCO's debut!

00:35:36.347 --> 00:35:38.348
FUWAMOCO Morning, Isabel!

00:35:38.648 --> 00:35:40.249
It's been an eventful time!

00:35:40.749 --> 00:35:41.550
Eventful time.

00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:49.695
But thank you for always being a big part of everything we do.

00:35:50.456 --> 00:35:55.841
And also, thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!
