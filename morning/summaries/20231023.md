## 😊 Good (?) News ([15:35](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=15m35s))

FUWAMOCO decided that enough was enough and changed a faulty light bulb at their home by themselves. Alas when it rains, it pours, and now the bulb at the bathroom is out.

## 🙊 Confession ([18:20](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=18m20s))

Fuwawa caught Mococo drinking a "rat king tea" made out of 14 bags of tea that Mococo herself saved for 2 weeks, let dry and reused, claiming it would be a waste just to throw them away after using them only once.

## ❌ Misunderstanding ([22:46](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=22m46s))

Last FUWAMOCO's "Convenience Store" stream saw a [hug pile](https://youtu.be/CGfOWj0IZSQ?t=10462) that went on over 40 minutes! Following karaoke stream, a Ruffian tried to take it a step further and, as if they were a shojo manga male protagonist, [they asked to kiss Fuwawa and Mococo's paw](https://youtu.be/xIyBZHUcSZM?t=10673). FUWAMOCO don't want Ruffians to misunderstand that this is perfectly OK as it makes them blush.

## 🏆 Natto Challenge ([25:09](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=25m09s))

After 7 weeks of starting this enduring challenge, Mococo actually did it: [she properly ate and chewed the natto](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=1820)! The second time if you ask Moco-chan but who's counting?

## 🐶 Doggie of the Day ([32:20](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=32m20s))

[ScalieDino](https://twitter.com/DinoScalie/status/1707295227411824889) shows us a pic of Dodo the husky.

## 🚶 Today I Went On A Walk ([34:28](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=34m28s))

[levinky?](https://twitter.com/levinky_art/status/1715713078187483457) took a walk in Japan and made a quick stop to try the so-revered Pon-de-rings. Their veredict: not as good as advertised.

## ❓ Question Of The Day ([36:06](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=36m06s))

[Miyako](https://twitter.com/MoeMoeMiyako/status/1713476110871384572) wonders if Fuwawa and Mococo have each their own set of mic and headphones for the streams. The sisters confirm this and explain a bit in detail how these are hooked up so they can hear and transmit audio, and how this setup is quite different from other hololive members.

## 📅 Next Stream & Schedule ([38:35](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=38m35s))
