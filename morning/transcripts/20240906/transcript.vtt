06:31.168 --> 06:31.708

06:37.649 --> 06:43.594
I'm about to explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning for those of us

06:54.797 --> 07:03.080
For those that are joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.629
BAU BAU!

07:29.310 --> 07:33.092
Ruffians, every time there's so much hashtag, hashtag!

07:33.812 --> 07:35.573
What are you doing, Hai?

07:35.693 --> 07:36.013
BAU BAU!

07:36.113 --> 07:39.975
I guess it's okay, maybe.

07:40.056 --> 07:40.776
Maybe.

07:44.407 --> 07:47.408
BAU BAU!

07:48.368 --> 07:49.208
End of the week.

07:49.869 --> 07:50.629
End of the week?

07:51.209 --> 07:52.429
Something special?

07:52.770 --> 07:54.550
Ruffians, I have a question!

07:54.990 --> 07:57.491
What do you like to do at the end of a busy week?

07:58.151 --> 08:00.052
Wait before going into the weekend!

08:04.033 --> 08:06.354
You like to curl up underneath a blanket?

08:06.374 --> 08:09.074
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

08:09.535 --> 08:10.655
Aside from sleep.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.407
Sleep unconsciously.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.283
You like to work out?

08:28.323 --> 08:29.883
That's good too!

08:30.083 --> 08:30.444
Cry.

08:30.484 --> 08:30.824
Cry?

08:31.304 --> 08:32.345
That's good I guess.

08:32.665 --> 08:34.946
Sometimes it's important to cry.

08:35.006 --> 08:36.427
Watch FUWAMOCO!

08:36.847 --> 08:38.668
BAU BAU!

08:38.728 --> 08:41.489
We're going into another fun weekend!

08:41.869 --> 08:42.890
BAU!

08:43.450 --> 08:44.511
We have some bad news.

08:45.891 --> 08:47.532
I said it was gonna be a fun weekend.

08:48.173 --> 08:49.473
Why does it have to stop at bad?

08:49.813 --> 08:50.674
Bad news first.

08:51.714 --> 08:52.535
BAU BAU.

08:54.936 --> 08:56.557
There was another Pero Sighting.

09:03.592 --> 09:05.575
Okay, let's just get it over with, Moco-chan.

09:06.596 --> 09:11.203
Well... Here he is.

09:11.323 --> 09:11.884
De-den!

09:18.066 --> 09:21.429
He looks especially nasty here.

09:21.449 --> 09:28.854
Did you eat all the ice cream you've been stockpiling through the summer and left nothing for Pero to enjoy?

09:30.616 --> 09:32.457
Is that why he looks extra nasty?

09:32.477 --> 09:33.298
I think so.

09:33.318 --> 09:34.759
That's what you did, huh?

09:35.659 --> 09:36.700
I guess that makes sense.

09:36.740 --> 09:45.327
You know, summer is how you want to eat the ice cream, but... Pero... Pero gets really nasty over sweets, okay?

09:47.457 --> 09:59.548
Maybe throw... You could throw maybe something in there for him to enjoy and then conveniently just kind of decide that now's a good time to clean out the refrigerator.

09:59.588 --> 09:59.929
Yeah!

09:59.949 --> 10:01.230
Right!

10:01.310 --> 10:03.632
Yeah, maybe throw in a pretty...

10:04.466 --> 10:05.447
And then pull the plug.

10:06.007 --> 10:13.453
It is really important to make sure that the refrigerator is all clean.

10:13.473 --> 10:17.036
That you're able to enjoy nice and fresh ice cream.

10:17.256 --> 10:21.519
Even during the winter.

10:21.619 --> 10:24.762
I get kind of nasty when the ice doesn't taste very good either.

10:27.071 --> 10:31.494
A lot more nasty than Pero, yeah.

10:31.934 --> 10:32.654
Do your best.

10:32.674 --> 10:37.077
Make sure it's nice and clean and then you can only enjoy some good ice cream in the winter.

10:37.097 --> 10:37.597
Yeah!

10:38.077 --> 10:42.199
Good ice is important.

10:44.441 --> 10:45.261
BAU BAU!

10:45.301 --> 10:49.003
It's not quite winter, yeah.

10:49.864 --> 10:50.884
Ruffians!

10:52.732 --> 10:56.535
You know that FUWAMOCO, we've been a little busy here.

10:56.995 --> 10:57.476
But!

10:58.016 --> 11:03.301
Within all of that, there's been some more voice packs released!

11:03.821 --> 11:06.263
BAU BAU!

11:06.283 --> 11:10.927
First, we have our back to school voice pack!

11:16.351 --> 11:20.895
Our back to school voice pack here, Ruffians!

11:22.479 --> 11:25.100
How many Ruffians are just back to school, huh?

11:25.580 --> 11:28.741
It's kind of a rough time of year, you know?

11:28.761 --> 11:30.802
Summertime was so much fun!

11:30.822 --> 11:35.604
We did so many things, and then... Back to the books.

11:36.084 --> 11:37.644
To a new place, you know?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.625
Gakusei sanshou.

11:43.106 --> 11:43.907
Don't cry!

11:45.702 --> 11:47.203
The training was rough too.

11:47.363 --> 11:48.264
Right!

11:48.304 --> 11:52.627
You know, if you want to go back to school, together with FUWAMOCO!

11:52.887 --> 11:53.888
This is for you!

11:53.988 --> 11:54.889
Yeah!

11:55.029 --> 11:57.531
You know... You graduated already?

11:58.231 --> 11:58.672
Well!

11:59.672 --> 12:01.253
If you want to experience it again.

12:01.274 --> 12:03.395
Back to school brings back!

12:03.695 --> 12:06.257
You know, maybe you could help out FUWAMOCO here!

12:06.277 --> 12:11.081
As I try to do some studying for my math, you know...

12:12.205 --> 12:12.946
Yeah.

12:13.506 --> 12:15.949
Help FUWAMOCO this school a little bit.

12:16.449 --> 12:21.273
If it's with FUWAMOCO then... Why?

12:21.814 --> 12:23.095
You're just starting.

12:23.115 --> 12:24.236
Good luck!

12:26.438 --> 12:27.379
Please check it out.

12:27.519 --> 12:32.164
Hopefully maybe it has this alternate effect that it makes you want to even study harder.

12:32.284 --> 12:32.724
Yeah.

12:32.844 --> 12:34.706
Although I'm sure you're already studying hard.

12:34.786 --> 12:35.306
I'm sure.

12:35.447 --> 12:35.727
Yeah.

12:36.257 --> 12:38.098
Don't overdo it, okay?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.678
BAU BAU!

12:40.699 --> 12:49.141
And just freshly released today, we have the four types of extreme love.

12:49.561 --> 12:54.523
Okay, off the top of your head right now, what are the four types of love, Hoshi?

12:54.923 --> 12:55.463
What is it?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.404
Tell me, explain, okay?

12:57.744 --> 13:02.966
And you can't answer Koyori-senpai, Kaede-senpai, Shiori Ayame-senpai, okay?

13:03.126 --> 13:04.306
There's a lot of types of love.

13:04.507 --> 13:05.167
At least FUWAMOCO-

13:06.208 --> 13:11.642
FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO Is this really the taste of love?

13:15.711 --> 13:15.751
Oh!

13:17.312 --> 13:17.352
Oh!

13:17.653 --> 13:20.714
I see a lot!

13:20.734 --> 13:28.959
I think you might be right!

13:29.019 --> 13:34.782
BAU BAU!

13:34.882 --> 13:37.003
What's your best answer then, Moco-chan?

13:37.443 --> 13:38.564
Romantic love.

13:39.124 --> 13:40.305
Familiar love.

13:40.905 --> 13:41.866
Friendship love.

13:47.689 --> 13:49.553
That's such a pretty action!

13:49.653 --> 13:50.314
Yeah!

13:50.354 --> 13:51.837
She is good, right!

13:52.138 --> 13:56.867
I thought about like the, what about, you know, the love that you feel towards like, your waifu.

14:00.138 --> 14:00.938
Is this regular love?

14:00.978 --> 14:02.759
Does it fall into the pet love category?

14:02.779 --> 14:03.739
I don't know.

14:04.639 --> 14:06.099
I think so, yes.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.680
Sounds legit, yeah!

14:09.720 --> 14:11.360
That falls into the category.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.881
But this is extreme love.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.501
Extreme love!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.882
What do you think FUWAMOCO could be, huh?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.349
Extreme love.

14:34.369 --> 14:34.429
Wow!

14:35.209 --> 14:37.770
The answer is... Yandere.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.168
Here you can listen too!

14:50.948 --> 14:53.310
Yandere FUWAMOCO you know.

14:53.530 --> 14:57.353
And we did our best to listen to Ruffians!

14:57.373 --> 15:03.077
Because you know your eyes, your ears, they're only FUWAMOCO's you know!

15:03.097 --> 15:05.159
Please take a listen, okay?

15:05.279 --> 15:07.961
I want to listen to ASMR.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.402
No!

15:09.622 --> 15:10.743
This is Yandere!

15:15.927 --> 15:16.868
Yeah.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.630
Oh, the voice acting was really good!

15:20.690 --> 15:22.311
Yeah, we did well!

15:22.331 --> 15:26.614
We always work really, really hard on the voice parts, so please give them a shot.

15:26.674 --> 15:37.440
I know some of our fans are surprised, but we've actually participated in every single voice part since we debuted, so... We're always doing our best!

15:37.961 --> 15:38.901
Please check it out!

15:39.121 --> 15:42.183
Fuwawa's scary, Mococo's super cute!

15:42.584 --> 15:43.964
Fuwamoco's scary!

15:45.326 --> 15:46.446
FUWAMOCO is scary.

15:47.247 --> 15:53.148
You know them all, Bijou!

15:53.629 --> 15:56.229
We're always doing our best, you know.

15:56.249 --> 16:01.331
And hopefully we can grow into even bigger grown dogs, alright?

16:02.411 --> 16:04.372
But here's some more voice parts.

16:04.412 --> 16:05.692
No, not what you want!

16:05.872 --> 16:08.353
We're talking about back to school!

16:08.413 --> 16:09.954
The yandere voice.

16:13.331 --> 16:22.821
Yeah, please give it a try someday!

16:22.841 --> 16:23.862
What is scary?

16:23.882 --> 16:28.066
Why are you super cute?

16:28.166 --> 16:31.850
Actually, Moco-chan's yandere is pretty rare, right?

16:32.570 --> 16:33.331
I don't think so.

16:33.832 --> 16:34.112
No!

16:36.540 --> 16:39.841
Yandere isn't really keeping the smile safe, but I get it!

16:40.982 --> 16:41.402
Really?

16:41.462 --> 16:42.683
It's keeping the smile safe.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.484
BAU BAU!

16:46.544 --> 16:48.665
BAU BAU!

16:49.765 --> 16:53.587
Please listen, you can find it on the official hololive shop!

16:53.607 --> 16:55.448
Okay, maybe there's some Ruffians out there.

16:55.528 --> 16:57.189
Okay, but where do I go now?

16:58.549 --> 17:02.591
Speaking of the hololive official shop, Ruffians!

17:02.711 --> 17:04.932
Thank you so much just recently!

17:05.932 --> 17:08.234
Our first anniversary merchandise!

17:08.354 --> 17:10.316
Thank you for all your pre-orders!

17:10.456 --> 17:14.699
Pre-orders have now officially closed since then, but thank you so much!

17:14.779 --> 17:18.282
I know there's a lot of Ruffians saying like, I got extra glasses!

17:18.342 --> 17:20.604
I got extra voice keychains!

17:20.624 --> 17:21.585
Thank you!

17:21.705 --> 17:25.688
I'm so excited for you to get your paws on them soon, Ruffians!

17:25.708 --> 17:27.189
Please look forward to them!

17:27.710 --> 17:31.052
But also right now, Ruffians!

17:32.453 --> 17:39.839
I think I've been seeing on Twitter there's some Ruffians that they've been getting their FUWAMOCO birthday merch finally!

17:40.039 --> 17:41.720
Thank you for waiting a long time!

17:41.740 --> 17:46.943
I think this means that all the Ruffians everywhere have received their birthday merch!

17:46.963 --> 17:47.664
Hopefully!

17:47.984 --> 17:48.965
Except no issues.

17:52.378 --> 17:56.961
But the first and most important thing is that you get your paws on the Ruffians!

17:57.582 --> 17:58.402
In a few days!

17:58.422 --> 17:59.583
Soon!

17:59.723 --> 18:03.065
I'm looking forward to it!

18:03.105 --> 18:04.506
You have yours!

18:04.806 --> 18:05.647
No issues!

18:05.667 --> 18:07.028
That was great!

18:07.268 --> 18:08.048
I'm glad, thank you!

18:16.004 --> 18:18.184
More important that it's in your paw.

18:18.304 --> 18:18.725
Yes!

18:19.385 --> 18:19.705
Yes!

18:19.725 --> 18:20.605
You have 10 Ruffians!

18:20.645 --> 18:21.945
That's a lot of Ruffians.

18:21.965 --> 18:22.645
Oh my gosh.

18:23.365 --> 18:25.346
But right now Ruffians!

18:25.686 --> 18:28.926
You know there's been a lot of merchandise coming out.

18:29.126 --> 18:32.987
But right now still for pre-order is our 3D debut!

18:33.087 --> 18:34.647
3D showcase!

18:34.768 --> 18:35.468
Yeah!

18:35.888 --> 18:40.149
You know there's so many exciting things that you might have forgotten about them.

18:40.449 --> 18:42.369
They are currently still on pre-order.

18:42.929 --> 18:45.430
I'm free until September 24th.

18:46.271 --> 18:49.912
So, a few weeks from now, but please don't forget about them.

18:49.992 --> 18:53.394
Especially if you want Mococo's tail keychain!

18:53.794 --> 18:57.195
It says a fluffy fabric, but I think that also means fuzzy, right?

18:57.315 --> 18:58.136
It's fuzzy, okay?

18:58.216 --> 18:59.816
It's not fluffy.

18:59.836 --> 19:00.357
Got it.

19:02.278 --> 19:04.138
Please don't miss it, Ruffians!

19:04.479 --> 19:09.661
Especially, you know, if you're working on that masterpiece FUWAMOCO Itanbei!

19:09.741 --> 19:11.322
Yeah, they'll be super duper cute!

19:11.442 --> 19:12.002
And you know,

19:15.405 --> 19:19.328
This is actually FUWAMOCO's brains.

19:19.408 --> 19:24.152
We wanted to make this because we thought it would be cute.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.085
And then this way too, I think you know in 3D when we're here like this sometimes it's kind of hard to see our tails.

19:34.805 --> 19:42.890
But I think it kind of shows just how surprising the difference of our tails is a lot.

19:43.270 --> 19:48.634
So if you want to be reminded, maybe if you want to be able to

19:51.489 --> 19:54.291
I think I forgot to order Pokey.

20:23.461 --> 20:29.125
And if you're back at school, actually Pokey might be very good.

20:29.465 --> 20:33.988
Because Pokey is made of a pillow you can put your arms on and rest on the desk.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.531
Very, very handy.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.493
Just lock him in your locker like the cell.

20:41.972 --> 20:42.993
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.546
I know it's a little bit overwhelming, huh?

21:01.566 --> 21:02.146
Very overwhelming.

21:25.820 --> 21:26.901
That's right, you know.

21:26.921 --> 21:33.251
We try to share what's still available and what's maybe going away soon.

21:33.632 --> 21:35.334
We need our FUWAMOCO moichikai right!

21:40.202 --> 21:42.084
Good luck Ruffians, you know.

21:42.504 --> 21:45.386
And thank you always too.

21:45.446 --> 21:46.767
Wow!

21:47.588 --> 21:49.670
For more exciting news!

21:49.770 --> 21:59.498
Maybe not so related to the hololive official shop, but still exciting if you like, well, cute things.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.939
Maybe singing?

22:02.528 --> 22:06.834
Bowling and video games!

22:07.314 --> 22:08.816
FUWAMOCO!

22:09.077 --> 22:13.142
We're gonna be at FUWAMOCO Round1!

22:13.222 --> 22:14.644
BAU BAU!

22:17.988 --> 22:22.072
All Round1 locations around the USA and Japan!

22:22.132 --> 22:22.933
Yeah!

22:22.993 --> 22:25.475
That's over 50 locations in the US and over 100 in Japan!

22:25.515 --> 22:25.655
Yeah!

22:25.715 --> 22:34.444
And look right there with Ayu-senpai, Ina-senpai, Fubuki-senpai, Okayu-senpai, and Gura-senpai!

22:34.504 --> 22:35.104
Look at us!

22:35.124 --> 22:37.106
We're all so cute!

22:37.627 --> 22:38.227
Yeah!

22:39.728 --> 22:41.949
And this event will be starting very soon!

22:41.969 --> 22:45.551
Starting in October and running into January so... Right!

22:45.611 --> 22:46.531
It's pretty long!

22:46.551 --> 22:47.451
Right!

22:47.551 --> 22:50.793
That means that you can go all the way to Round1!

22:51.093 --> 22:51.593
Three months!

22:52.793 --> 22:53.414
FUWAMOCO Hi!

22:53.434 --> 22:57.197
Super duper cute stuff.

23:16.593 --> 23:19.315
I think your loader has around one foot.

23:19.755 --> 23:21.396
So please go and check it out.

23:21.636 --> 23:23.698
Have FUWAMOCO done bowling before?

23:24.958 --> 23:26.119
Ruffians, what do you think?

23:26.159 --> 23:27.420
Do you think we are pros?

23:28.220 --> 23:28.961
What do you think?

23:29.902 --> 23:31.483
How do you think we do our bowling?

23:37.850 --> 23:38.110
Nope.

23:38.491 --> 23:38.831
Nope.

23:39.332 --> 23:45.560
I think we did a little bit better than when we played with Wasame-senpai.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.662
Wasame-senpai.

23:47.922 --> 23:48.864
That was rough.

23:49.324 --> 23:52.468
I also almost tossed the controller at the screen.

23:53.529 --> 23:55.632
But I think we did a little bit better than that.

24:00.615 --> 24:08.976
Well, if you want to challenge us at bowling, maybe Round1 might be a good place to do that, huh?

24:09.376 --> 24:15.657
Well, when it comes to singing, you know, we'd be a little bit more passionate and more confident, huh?

24:15.677 --> 24:19.258
Considering we're idols and not boys.

24:19.938 --> 24:23.219
Oh, and I think I saw a comment asking what Round1 is.

24:25.766 --> 24:28.848
Entertainment Station.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.148
Velvet Boy.

24:30.348 --> 24:31.189
Arcade Games.

24:31.409 --> 24:32.049
Howl Gear.

24:32.509 --> 24:34.210
Super duper fun!

24:34.430 --> 24:38.552
So please go ahead and head over to the nearest Round1 to check it out.

24:38.572 --> 24:39.973
Starting October 11th!

24:40.053 --> 24:41.453
Yeah, not too early.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.154
Don't get too excited quite yet.

24:43.574 --> 24:48.637
Please look forward to more FUWAMOCO!

24:48.717 --> 24:49.717
BAU BAU!

24:53.496 --> 24:57.038
Well, you know, now it's officially September.

24:57.718 --> 25:00.820
And well, summer is sort of starting to end.

25:01.260 --> 25:01.420
Yeah.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.062
Obviously had a bunch of things going on, you know.

25:05.082 --> 25:09.385
Our first anniversary, our 3D debuts, Breaking Dementia!

25:09.425 --> 25:09.925
But also!

25:11.346 --> 25:15.412
Also, there was the whole summer bingo!

25:15.792 --> 25:18.837
Bingo!

25:19.337 --> 25:20.018
Yeah!

25:20.078 --> 25:22.401
You know, Ruffians!

25:22.502 --> 25:25.846
There was maybe a FUWAMOCO Morning and that was a little bit funny.

25:26.987 --> 25:30.570
Uh, a bunch of different things, you know, but... She's a bit flirty!

25:30.650 --> 25:31.550
We did our best!

25:31.590 --> 25:35.693
We participated in the holosummer bingo for the very first time!

25:35.733 --> 25:38.014
We filled out the normal bingo sheet.

25:38.034 --> 25:40.095
We did the infernal bingo!

25:40.316 --> 25:41.596
We did everything!

25:41.636 --> 25:43.157
We completed it all!

25:43.177 --> 25:43.317
Yes!

25:43.337 --> 25:44.738
We played a prank on Biboo!

25:44.758 --> 25:45.018
Yup!

25:45.319 --> 25:45.539
Yup!

25:45.579 --> 25:46.339
We ate bugs.

25:46.399 --> 25:47.580
We made her eat bugs.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.541
There's a lot of bugs.

25:48.641 --> 25:49.962
We had a FUWAMOCO maid cafe!

25:50.002 --> 25:51.202
We caught bugs!

25:51.242 --> 25:51.903
Yeah!

25:51.923 --> 25:54.905
Uh, you know we did everything and anything!

25:55.828 --> 25:58.791
We had very good luck.

25:58.811 --> 26:03.275
More than anything, Ruffians, we hope you had a fun time together with us.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.257
On the left paw.

26:16.697 --> 26:17.337
Wow.

26:17.958 --> 26:18.918
FUWAMOCO!

26:19.278 --> 26:24.501
We happen to be the only hololive members that completed all their bingos.

26:24.602 --> 26:25.302
Both bingos.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.923
The Inferno bingo too.

26:28.144 --> 26:32.046
And didn't win a single prize.

26:32.146 --> 26:33.066
Not even close.

26:33.106 --> 26:36.188
Not many members completed everything.

26:36.649 --> 26:39.010
So I think we should have... What's the word?

26:40.817 --> 26:41.298
No.

26:41.498 --> 26:41.798
Pity?

26:41.818 --> 26:41.858
No.

26:42.379 --> 26:44.541
We've definitely been pity.

26:45.902 --> 26:47.604
We should hold our heads high!

26:47.644 --> 26:48.645
We did it all!

26:48.765 --> 26:49.305
Yeah!

26:49.366 --> 26:50.547
You know!

26:51.027 --> 26:55.091
Just in for FUWAMOCO's consolation prize!

26:55.111 --> 26:55.171
Wow!

26:55.492 --> 27:02.659
We will definitely be enjoying our bunch of eye-warmers, face masks, bath salts!

27:03.139 --> 27:03.680
Yeah!

27:04.240 --> 27:07.861
But more than that, you know, Ruffians, it's not about winning prizes.

27:08.161 --> 27:10.002
We weren't doing it to win prizes.

27:10.022 --> 27:11.882
We weren't doing it to have fun.

27:12.142 --> 27:13.343
You know?

27:13.423 --> 27:22.045
So, I think you know, I know, Marine-senpai, Senpai, Porter-onee-chan, they're like, how FUWAMOCO I feel so bad for them!

27:22.125 --> 27:24.586
But, that's not why we are doing it.

27:24.626 --> 27:27.127
We're doing it for the memories, the journey.

27:27.367 --> 27:28.587
You know?

27:28.707 --> 27:30.668
So... We wanted to do it together.

27:30.828 --> 27:31.128
Yeah.

27:31.568 --> 27:35.010
And I think we're able to do just that, Ruffians!

27:35.030 --> 27:41.413
So we're gonna enjoy the consolation prizes that I think are very amazing.

27:41.433 --> 27:45.996
You know, Brighton used the eye masks all the time too!

27:46.056 --> 27:47.117
Bath salts too!

27:47.137 --> 27:48.497
Special ones!

27:50.730 --> 27:52.211
You know we're gonna enjoy those!

27:52.572 --> 27:54.533
Enjoy the memories we made all together!

27:54.674 --> 27:58.157
And we're gonna do our best next year too!

27:58.277 --> 28:00.359
Next year's hololive summer big!

28:00.579 --> 28:02.701
Maybe we didn't have luck this time.

28:03.001 --> 28:07.225
But maybe that just means the luck is waiting for us in other ways.

28:07.765 --> 28:10.908
So in case stuff like this happens, it's okay.

28:11.969 --> 28:12.610
It'll come around.

28:14.231 --> 28:16.794
BAU BAU!

28:17.174 --> 28:18.776
Yeah, we're just charging up the luck.

28:19.056 --> 28:20.958
Exactly.

28:21.739 --> 28:23.441
BAU BAU!

28:24.181 --> 28:29.307
Another really happy day happened, Ruffians!

28:29.787 --> 28:35.491
You know how we just released our original song, Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★, right?

28:35.611 --> 28:36.612
Right, right, right.

28:36.832 --> 28:38.454
You listened to it, right?

28:38.634 --> 28:39.835
Thank you, Ruffians.

28:39.915 --> 28:44.058
It just recently got over 500,000 listens on YouTube here.

28:44.398 --> 28:46.139
If you haven't checked it out, please check it out.

28:46.239 --> 28:47.240
And it's very cute.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.601
It's also on Spotify.

28:48.941 --> 28:49.141
But!

28:50.322 --> 28:57.771
Now, you can also sing Born to be "BAU"DOL☆★ at Karaoke!

28:57.932 --> 29:01.175
"BAU"DOL is now in Joysound Karaoke!

29:01.396 --> 29:03.438
And also there, oh I see something else.

29:03.478 --> 29:04.540
hololive English -Advent-.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.183
Sirens as well!

29:08.624 --> 29:11.646
As well as Mikocchi-san.

29:12.147 --> 29:15.850
But you know, we always really wanted to have a song at Karaoke!

29:16.170 --> 29:22.736
And now this means that Ruffians, when you go to Karaoke, or maybe when you come to Japan, you're like, I'm gonna go to Karaoke!

29:23.336 --> 29:26.158
You can go at the same point, and we bottle up!

29:28.400 --> 29:30.801
Yeah, heck yeah!

29:30.821 --> 29:32.381
Heck yeah!

29:32.942 --> 29:35.662
Make sure though that you request Joy-san.

29:36.063 --> 29:41.805
Some places have multiple systems, so make sure if you're going to karaoke that it's Joy-san.

29:41.885 --> 29:42.685
Joy-san!

29:42.905 --> 29:46.206
Don't wait for sure, you can BAU BAU lots of those.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.126
Yes!

29:47.246 --> 29:47.646
Yeah.

29:50.027 --> 29:51.268
I love going to karaoke.

29:51.348 --> 29:53.049
It's so much fun!

29:53.409 --> 29:57.351
It's been a little while, but the last time we went was pretty memorable.

29:58.351 --> 30:01.013
We went with some hololive English members.

30:06.175 --> 30:08.096
Yeah, you can be a FUWAMOCO at karaoke!

30:08.216 --> 30:09.056
Exactly!

30:09.176 --> 30:10.117
Exactly!

30:10.317 --> 30:11.497
Too embarrassing!

30:11.577 --> 30:13.718
Okay, you sing Mococo's part, okay?

30:13.778 --> 30:14.958
Not too embarrassing!

30:15.458 --> 30:17.779
Too much fun, okay?

30:17.819 --> 30:21.221
Don't let embarrassment keep you from having fun, okay?

30:22.501 --> 30:23.281
It's important.

30:23.361 --> 30:23.681
Yeah.

30:24.402 --> 30:25.142
I don't know, that's...

30:26.465 --> 30:29.007
That's not how I want to live my life, you know?

30:30.608 --> 30:33.190
Let's live the best life we can, FUWAMOCO.

30:33.210 --> 30:34.331
Without regrets, okay?

30:34.391 --> 30:35.472
No regrets.

30:36.312 --> 30:36.792
BAU BAU!

30:38.458 --> 30:48.948
You can sing it all yourself, so... That might be kind of tricky, but... You can do it!

30:49.469 --> 30:50.730
The FUWAMOCO Challenge.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.091
Mama!

30:52.151 --> 30:52.972
Mama!

30:53.032 --> 30:53.412
Wow!

30:53.432 --> 30:56.355
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day today!

30:56.455 --> 30:59.638
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

31:00.278 --> 31:02.579
It's Enzo!

31:02.779 --> 31:07.562
He's so cute and happy puppy!

31:08.282 --> 31:15.086
Enzo reminds me of me because he's so fluffy and active and happy!

31:15.166 --> 31:16.346
BAU BAU!

31:16.406 --> 31:16.967
I'm honored!

31:22.069 --> 31:26.251
I hope Enzo stays fluffy and happy forever and ever.

31:26.271 --> 31:27.812
She looks a bit fuzzy though, huh?

31:28.372 --> 31:30.633
Moco-chan, you feel a little bit left out?

31:32.274 --> 31:33.694
Look, it's his team expression.

31:35.855 --> 31:36.916
Let's see.

31:42.678 --> 31:43.019
Wow!

31:43.179 --> 31:43.879
I'm Enzo!

31:44.339 --> 31:44.819
Yeah!

31:46.020 --> 31:48.621
How does Enzo BAU BAU?

31:48.641 --> 31:50.522
It looks sort of like...

31:51.919 --> 31:52.961
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

32:05.293 --> 32:07.796
Okay, Moco-chan.

32:07.976 --> 32:11.078
I think we can all tell, but Enzo!

32:11.379 --> 32:15.102
Enzo's the best puppy you could ever wish for.

32:15.402 --> 32:18.005
I know, you can see here he's always happy.

32:18.025 --> 32:20.807
He loves to make you happy too.

32:20.827 --> 32:24.531
I think life is really exciting for him.

32:26.552 --> 32:27.653
Look!

32:27.773 --> 32:29.094
He's like, yes!

32:29.274 --> 32:30.515
Today is exciting!

32:30.535 --> 32:32.436
Today is Friday!

32:32.556 --> 32:32.936
Yes!

32:33.497 --> 32:34.857
Tomorrow is Saturday.

32:35.238 --> 32:35.798
Yes!

32:36.078 --> 32:38.400
And we're gonna go for walks every day.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.480
Yes!

32:39.881 --> 32:40.221
Yeah.

32:40.721 --> 32:47.005
But more than anything, Enzo just can't wait to spend every day together with you.

32:48.126 --> 32:52.348
And also, very important, Enzo's very fluffy.

32:52.408 --> 32:53.249
Super fluffy.

32:53.589 --> 32:54.950
And I think that's super great.

32:55.630 --> 32:58.251
BAU BAU!

32:59.011 --> 33:01.051
He does look like he just heard some good news.

33:01.151 --> 33:02.212
Why?

33:02.532 --> 33:04.612
That's Enzo every day, all the time.

33:04.632 --> 33:08.293
The good news is that he sees you in front of him.

33:09.314 --> 33:12.014
BAU BAU!

33:12.214 --> 33:14.415
For today, I went on a walk.

33:14.455 --> 33:16.015
We have... De-den!

33:20.217 --> 33:23.441
That's a perfect FUWAMOCO sky.

33:23.481 --> 33:26.944
Yeah, with the Ruffians too!

33:27.385 --> 33:33.030
We're so happy to hear that you got up for a good walk nice and early in the day.

33:33.271 --> 33:37.755
Exercise right after you wake up is always really good for you.

33:37.996 --> 33:40.778
The Ruffians along with you.

33:41.179 --> 33:42.260
It's good to have company.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.041
It has been so much fun.

33:45.981 --> 33:48.943
I can just smell the cool air.

33:49.043 --> 33:50.923
I can feel it on my skin.

33:51.483 --> 33:53.184
I hope you had a wonderful time!

33:53.224 --> 33:55.445
Thank you for sharing!

33:55.505 --> 33:56.545
Thank you!

33:56.585 --> 33:58.426
BAU BAU!

33:58.826 --> 34:02.748
And next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

34:03.828 --> 34:03.968
Oh!

34:04.408 --> 34:06.309
Hi FUWAMOCO!

34:06.749 --> 34:12.450
After you open pre-chat, what are you usually doing during that time before stream?

34:12.850 --> 34:14.271
Getting more homework done?

34:14.571 --> 34:15.851
Taking a quick nap?

34:16.191 --> 34:18.472
Watching pre-chat shenanigans?

34:18.892 --> 34:20.873
Or maybe something else?

34:22.293 --> 34:25.054
We are go-go-going still.

34:25.074 --> 34:28.755
Yeah, you know, getting everything prepared.

34:29.155 --> 34:30.475
Our Barker's getting

34:31.115 --> 34:31.575
Wake up!

34:31.655 --> 34:35.576
Grabbing tea and responding to anything from Morning Chat.

34:35.677 --> 34:37.677
Every single moment is accounted for.

34:38.137 --> 34:38.838
Every minute.

34:39.598 --> 34:40.758
Definitely no naps!

34:40.898 --> 34:41.778
No time for that!

34:41.899 --> 34:42.339
No!

34:42.359 --> 34:47.020
It takes a lot of time to prepare for things.

34:47.720 --> 34:52.922
I think, you know Ruffians, it's kinda hard to understand unless you do it yourself.

34:55.023 --> 34:58.524
But we're always doing our best and that does take time.

35:00.472 --> 35:06.956
So for us, the last hour before stream, it's never ever just relaxed free time.

35:07.596 --> 35:07.817
No.

35:08.077 --> 35:08.357
No.

35:08.637 --> 35:09.017
Yeah.

35:09.438 --> 35:13.360
It'll be nice, but... No, at that point we are mad dashing.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.321
Yeah.

35:16.662 --> 35:19.084
Every last moment, every last second.

35:19.104 --> 35:21.205
We know by what minute what needs to be done.

35:22.846 --> 35:23.086
Yeah.

35:24.007 --> 35:25.868
And if not... Yeah.

35:29.507 --> 35:34.148
No Ruffians, thank you for always being here!

35:34.208 --> 35:36.929
We're happy to be able to share your mornings with you!

35:37.969 --> 35:38.709
BAU BAU!

35:40.329 --> 35:42.010
I'm Ruffians!

35:42.230 --> 35:47.551
I want to say another big thank you so much for all your submissions!

35:48.191 --> 35:55.172
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING right at the top there to send us your questions!

35:55.553 --> 35:57.373
Your Pero Sightings if you see him.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.802
Being nasty or grumpy.

35:59.822 --> 36:01.563
Finish your walks.

36:02.184 --> 36:05.266
And you know, you're Doggie of the Day too!

36:05.467 --> 36:07.128
Thank you, Ruffians!

36:07.228 --> 36:08.730
BAU BAU!

36:08.770 --> 36:12.633
And for our next theme, we have... De-den!

36:12.673 --> 36:13.414
Day 7!

36:13.454 --> 36:13.614
Day 7!

36:13.754 --> 36:14.455
Of Earth 6?

36:17.547 --> 36:23.093
Seven Numbers of ENigmatic Recollection!

36:23.193 --> 36:28.059
We're reaching, you know, the end of ENigmatic Recollection.

36:28.079 --> 36:30.642
The grand finale is within sight!

36:31.242 --> 36:34.986
And I think there's even more crazy things going on!

36:35.006 --> 36:37.209
Maybe like you were saying, shonan again.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.932
We'll see just what's going on next in ENigmatic Recollection!

36:41.952 --> 36:42.692
BAU BAU!

36:42.752 --> 36:46.054
Time for our schedule!

36:46.134 --> 36:48.555
The big finale is on Saturday!

36:48.575 --> 36:51.377
Saturday at 7pm PT.

36:51.417 --> 36:59.481
But after that, on Sunday, we're gonna go take a look and watch all day 1 and day 2 of Breaking the Mansions!

36:59.941 --> 37:00.682
So Ruffians!

37:01.242 --> 37:02.803
Maybe get some popcorn!

37:03.123 --> 37:04.684
Maybe some ice cream!

37:04.704 --> 37:05.845
Penlight!

37:06.025 --> 37:08.326
Apple because it's at the Big Apple!

37:08.346 --> 37:10.708
And also your streaming ticket!

37:11.148 --> 37:12.909
And let's re-enjoy!

37:13.209 --> 37:13.750
Re-break!

37:14.130 --> 37:15.691
The dimensions!

37:15.871 --> 37:18.532
And let's break the dimensions all together!

37:18.552 --> 37:23.595
We'll have lots of secrets!

37:24.156 --> 37:25.296
We have a lot to say!

37:25.316 --> 37:27.518
A lot to talk about!

37:27.538 --> 37:29.079
And we might get a little emotional.

37:31.481 --> 37:34.705
BAU BAU!

37:35.005 --> 37:38.369
Fuwawafians are joining us today through the Archive!

37:38.770 --> 37:41.152
Here is your FUWAMOCO list!

37:41.713 --> 37:44.116
It's BAU BAU yagere!

37:44.296 --> 37:46.518
BAU BAU!

37:48.240 --> 37:49.380
Thank you, Ruffians!

37:49.480 --> 37:54.022
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:54.342 --> 38:01.264
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

38:01.624 --> 38:02.805
Dear BAU BAU!

38:03.725 --> 38:06.807
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

38:24.237 --> 38:32.200
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

38:32.260 --> 38:35.121
