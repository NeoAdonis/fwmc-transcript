05:16.028 --> 05:17.929
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:18.490 --> 05:21.992
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:22.092 --> 05:25.535
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:25.575 --> 05:26.075
BAU BAU!

05:27.321 --> 05:31.224
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:31.825 --> 05:34.347
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:35.087 --> 05:37.149
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:37.209 --> 05:40.872
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:41.933 --> 05:43.934
BAU BAU!

05:43.954 --> 05:45.876
Moco-chan.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.058
You feel like extra.

05:50.259 --> 05:51.601
BAU BAU!

05:51.801 --> 05:52.761
Crunchy today!

05:54.366 --> 05:56.128
BAU BAU!

05:56.709 --> 05:59.712
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:59.772 --> 06:06.199
Thank you for joining us today for the 89th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:06.819 --> 06:08.821
BAU BAU!

06:08.962 --> 06:10.023
Is Moco-chan's voice okay?

06:10.043 --> 06:11.044
BAU BAU!

06:18.270 --> 06:24.436
Well, today is the 89th episode with the rare raspy Moco-chan!

06:24.456 --> 06:25.216
Is that it?

06:25.276 --> 06:25.697
Crunchy.

06:30.191 --> 06:37.273
It's another FUWAMOCO Morning like every other morning.

06:45.416 --> 07:00.380
For our Ruffians that are joining us for the first time, or maybe Ruffians that are still half-awake and maybe forgot, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

07:00.400 --> 07:02.841
Hosted by us.

07:04.001 --> 07:05.723
FUWAMOCO!

07:05.743 --> 07:12.629
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:12.729 --> 07:15.472
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

07:19.373 --> 07:21.435
FWMC Morning!

07:21.515 --> 07:25.638
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:26.098 --> 07:28.119
BAU BAU!

07:30.361 --> 07:37.045
It's okay, it's kind of like, uh, maybe Moco-chan, maybe some, some food kind of got a bit stuffed in.

07:37.486 --> 07:39.387
Like some cookies or something.

07:40.268 --> 07:41.428
You know, kibble.

07:41.508 --> 07:43.430
What cookies have I eaten, huh?

07:43.530 --> 07:46.172
I don't know, Moco-chan, that's what I'm asking you!

07:48.230 --> 07:49.991
I don't know.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.574
FUWAMOCO-chan, are you feeling hungry right now?

07:55.015 --> 07:55.816
Not really.

07:55.856 --> 08:01.100
Cuz you've been eating the cookies, huh?

08:02.802 --> 08:03.282
No!

08:05.003 --> 08:05.344
FUWAMOCO.

08:05.364 --> 08:07.505
Do you have some cookies?

08:07.545 --> 08:09.567
No, I don't have cookies, but there is!

08:10.608 --> 08:12.149
Another Pero Sighting.

08:14.739 --> 08:18.181
Let's... Pero's not up to trouble again, is he?

08:18.601 --> 08:21.863
Well, let's see it!

08:23.864 --> 08:24.544
De-den!

08:26.765 --> 08:32.889
I don't see anything there, that was just a... Wait!

08:33.169 --> 08:33.509
Wait!

08:33.969 --> 08:38.151
This is what Tyler and Misa don't have!

08:38.211 --> 08:39.872
These unique ponds of it!

08:39.912 --> 08:41.633
We haven't seen this one before!

08:43.524 --> 08:56.772
Ruffians, you know, if we haven't seen it, if we haven't tried it before, that means... We're gonna have to taste test it, right?

08:56.792 --> 08:59.694
What do you think, Ruffians?

08:59.754 --> 09:00.735
Should we eat it?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.697
It will give us a tummy ache.

09:03.917 --> 09:04.637
It will, right?

09:05.037 --> 09:05.278
Right.

09:07.256 --> 09:07.456
Eat!

09:08.157 --> 09:08.377
Eat it!

09:08.897 --> 09:09.397
Noi!

09:10.238 --> 09:10.758
Hai!

09:11.479 --> 09:12.019
Hai!

09:12.359 --> 09:12.799
Ya!

09:13.400 --> 09:14.220
It's poisonous!

09:14.721 --> 09:15.681
Are you sure?

09:17.462 --> 09:18.022
I don't know.

09:18.283 --> 09:24.907
If you say it's poisonous... Ah, it's poisonous, so I'll eat it first, but then... FUWAMOCO, how weak could I get at this, huh?

09:25.087 --> 09:26.928
We can!

09:27.028 --> 09:31.791
Moco-chan, what's wrong with that?

09:35.128 --> 09:35.689
BAU!

09:35.709 --> 09:36.971
We should.

09:37.031 --> 09:42.060
Yeah, I don't think, you know, no pondering would ever give us a tummy ache.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.783
No, not poisonous.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.269
You know, just the opposite of poisonous.

09:49.209 --> 09:49.809
Delicious.

09:50.010 --> 09:50.670
Delicious.

09:50.770 --> 09:53.371
That's the opposite of poisonous, right?

09:53.411 --> 09:53.611
Yeah!

09:53.892 --> 09:56.893
Yeah, and you know, this one looks so unique.

09:57.394 --> 10:03.457
I don't know, it kind of looks like it might have a bit of a nostalgic, a familiar taste to it.

10:03.597 --> 10:04.037
Yeah.

10:04.517 --> 10:07.219
Where should we start eating it from?

10:07.599 --> 10:08.239
The face?

10:08.840 --> 10:09.140
Face?

10:09.360 --> 10:10.060
The wings.

10:13.030 --> 10:13.911
Ruffians.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.373
That's a big bite.

10:16.815 --> 10:18.137
Try it for us.

10:18.398 --> 10:20.420
Why would you eat it for Ruffians?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.203
Huh?

10:24.346 --> 10:24.927
Huh?

10:28.075 --> 10:29.675
Should I go for the wings?

10:29.856 --> 10:32.696
The wings!

10:32.776 --> 10:36.077
Well, we hope you enjoyed it lots and lots!

10:36.477 --> 10:39.078
Look out for donuts that could hurt your tummy though, okay?

10:39.118 --> 10:39.698
BAU BAU!

10:39.718 --> 10:40.739
Face for last!

10:40.759 --> 10:44.820
Just gonna leave a little bit and then...

10:52.315 --> 10:56.357
Lots of strategies!

10:56.538 --> 10:58.239
BAU BAU!

10:58.259 --> 10:59.920
Well, Ruffians!

10:59.940 --> 11:09.446
We were so excited to share this with you because actually something really really cool went on sale the other day!

11:09.566 --> 11:10.487
It's official!

11:10.827 --> 11:20.074
You can now find us, FUWAMOCO, along with Advent and our senpai at convenience stores all across Japan!

11:20.714 --> 11:21.415
BAU BAU!

11:21.535 --> 11:22.716
BAU BAU!

11:22.756 --> 11:24.437
And do you know why that is?

11:24.557 --> 11:24.977
Why?

11:25.077 --> 11:30.662
Because Bandai's WeHouse chocolate wafers are now out!

11:30.682 --> 11:31.022
BAU BAU!

11:31.062 --> 11:32.883
BAU BAU!

11:33.184 --> 11:33.584
You know what?

11:33.644 --> 11:34.765
It was so cool, guys.

11:35.225 --> 11:38.328
We went to go get some vitamin jellies at the conbini.

11:38.608 --> 11:38.868
Yeah.

11:38.888 --> 11:42.030
But instead, we met eyes with Nerissa!

11:42.791 --> 11:45.373
And then we saw the WeHouse wafers and went on sale!

11:45.413 --> 11:46.834
Yeah!

11:46.954 --> 11:47.355
Alright!

11:48.135 --> 11:48.655
BAU BAU!

12:09.780 --> 12:11.121
The very crunchy.

12:11.141 --> 12:21.008
But more important than the chocolate, my friends, is it comes with a super cute holographic hololive card too!

12:21.308 --> 12:24.930
And of course, you can collect FUWAMOCO's cards!

12:25.451 --> 12:26.852
That's the only trick is!

12:28.419 --> 12:29.480
It's random!

12:29.540 --> 12:30.540
It's random.

12:30.600 --> 12:35.863
So you might need to eat more than a few chocolate wafers before getting your original.

12:35.883 --> 12:36.023
Yeah.

12:36.503 --> 12:41.806
And on Twitter I was seeing some Ruffians who had a very big stack.

12:42.786 --> 12:46.808
Like over 20 centimeters of wafers.

12:47.088 --> 12:48.169
A lot of wafers.

12:49.830 --> 12:50.430
Yeah.

12:50.910 --> 12:58.054
But when you do though, and you open it up, you can enjoy it and check out the handwritten

12:58.174 --> 12:59.375
FUWAMOCO!

12:59.395 --> 13:02.839
We bought one pack each when we saw them at the convenience!

13:02.920 --> 13:04.682
And we had fun opening them together!

13:17.396 --> 13:17.857
Okay, Moco-chan.

13:17.877 --> 13:18.538
Don't look!

13:18.698 --> 13:19.700
Don't look please at me!

13:19.860 --> 13:20.881
Okay, okay.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.864
3, 2, 1, flip!

13:23.445 --> 13:26.569
And I got RuinÃ©-senpai!

13:27.250 --> 13:29.693
And I got Towa-senpai!

13:30.374 --> 13:33.578
Yeah, but actually, Ruffians...

13:35.319 --> 13:49.304
It's not just, you know, it's really fun, but if you look very closely, it seems like there happens to be a good amount of members that have made some spelling mistakes on their cards.

13:51.624 --> 13:52.425
Moco-chan.

13:54.405 --> 13:55.766
Yeah, Moco-chan!

14:01.261 --> 14:09.066
One kind Ruffian pointed out that I made a bit of a mistake on the first kanji for onsen.

14:09.106 --> 14:10.186
The hot springs.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.067
Oops!

14:12.288 --> 14:16.010
No wonder it looked a bit off to me.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.271
Right, right.

14:17.751 --> 14:20.893
No one said anything though.

14:21.013 --> 14:23.734
No one said anything, but you felt it look hmmm.

14:23.774 --> 14:24.315
Yeah.

14:24.855 --> 14:25.235
Hmm.

14:27.392 --> 14:29.413
Well, it should be fine!

14:29.873 --> 14:34.115
Yeah, well, Koyori-senpai, she made a similar mistake too.

14:34.135 --> 14:36.515
Praise is worth it.

14:37.056 --> 14:39.456
That's kind of mean to Koyori-senpai, no?

14:40.077 --> 14:41.557
It's the truth.

14:42.077 --> 14:47.800
She said that, you know, she has a habit of hers is letting her nails grow really long.

14:48.180 --> 14:53.802
But instead of writing nails, she made a bit of a mistake and wrote gourds.

14:54.963 --> 14:58.607
I hope Koyari-senpai enjoys her pumpkins!

14:59.368 --> 15:04.374
I like growing out the gourds.

15:05.355 --> 15:10.521
But, unfortunately, it doesn't stop there.

15:10.601 --> 15:13.465
There was another senpai that made a mistake.

15:15.220 --> 15:17.623
Lamy-senpai.

15:18.224 --> 15:27.736
Yeah, I was admiring her seriously too beautiful penmanship and I was wondering, how can I write such beautiful letters too?

15:28.497 --> 15:32.021
But that's when I noticed... Lamy-senpai!

15:33.351 --> 15:37.173
She made a mistake on her name here!

15:37.894 --> 15:39.495
The katakana, not me.

15:39.855 --> 15:40.455
Me!

15:40.976 --> 15:42.016
It's backwards!

15:42.777 --> 15:43.677
Haa!

15:43.917 --> 15:44.658
Haa!

15:45.778 --> 15:47.620
Mami-senpai!

15:48.200 --> 15:49.080
Haa!

15:49.541 --> 15:52.302
But we all make mistakes sometimes, you know?

15:52.322 --> 15:53.083
Yeah.

15:53.603 --> 15:56.085
It's like me... It's cute!

15:56.465 --> 16:01.808
Mami-senpai, Koyanai-senpai is just cute, but Moco-chan's just pathetic.

16:02.896 --> 16:03.337
Am I cute?

16:03.357 --> 16:05.099
Am I cute today, Ruffians?

16:05.139 --> 16:05.500
Yeah.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.821
That means I'm fine.

16:15.461 --> 16:19.784
Lamy-senpai is Lamy-senpai, except here, she's Lashii-senpai.

16:19.964 --> 16:20.765
But it's okay!

16:22.466 --> 16:25.168
Kawaii kara yurusho!

16:25.248 --> 16:26.649
BAU BAU!

16:26.769 --> 16:31.293
FUWAMOCO getting our Ruffian cards!

16:31.313 --> 16:33.074
FUWAMOCO cards!

16:33.714 --> 16:34.355
Ruffians!

16:34.575 --> 16:35.876
Ah, Moco-chan.

16:35.956 --> 16:39.679
If there was Ruffian cards, then we'd be eating chocolate wafers forever.

16:42.099 --> 16:47.722
Get the FUWAMOCO card!

16:47.742 --> 16:48.362
BAU BAU!

16:49.163 --> 16:50.404
It's so cool, you know?

16:50.464 --> 16:54.806
You can go to the convenience store and find us there too.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.287
Right!

16:56.907 --> 17:01.290
Well, it's not just the Ruffians, actually.

17:01.670 --> 17:02.210
Me!

17:02.430 --> 17:03.391
Fuwawa!

17:04.011 --> 17:06.533
I have some good news too!

17:07.273 --> 17:09.514
But first, Ruffians!

17:11.630 --> 17:15.453
Do you notice something different with me recently?

17:17.014 --> 17:17.814
Recently.

17:23.898 --> 17:24.659
Do you?

17:27.821 --> 17:34.045
I'm Fuwawa!

17:34.766 --> 17:35.967
I'm not Moco-chan!

17:36.427 --> 17:37.568
I'm Fuwawa!

17:41.638 --> 17:43.378
I look fantastic!

17:43.538 --> 17:44.319
Extra cute!

17:44.859 --> 17:50.480
I got more fluffy!

17:50.720 --> 17:51.700
BAU BAU!

17:51.940 --> 17:55.221
I got fluffier, like, my foot!

17:55.281 --> 18:05.042
You know, a little while ago, Moco-chan and I, we mentioned that we got something special for our bath that makes us fluffier and fuzzier!

18:05.362 --> 18:06.903
And it's really fancy!

18:07.483 --> 18:07.563
And...

18:08.483 --> 18:10.704
Actually, I think it really has!

18:11.344 --> 18:15.625
We always dreamed about getting it for years and years and years!

18:16.405 --> 18:18.605
And there was also a special sale!

18:18.645 --> 18:22.006
Why are you laughing?

18:22.066 --> 18:22.426
What?

18:22.666 --> 18:26.627
It sounded like you were saying, yours and yours and yours.

18:26.687 --> 18:28.687
Yours and yours and yours!

18:30.308 --> 18:32.188
Yours and yours and yours!

18:34.092 --> 18:42.999
But now, Ruffians, my hair is so much softer and fuller and also very fluffy!

18:43.259 --> 18:45.201
I'm really happy!

18:45.721 --> 18:53.767
Yeah, and you know, as a demon dog and also as the fluffy one, my fur is very important to me.

18:54.127 --> 18:55.709
Me too, okay?

18:57.090 --> 18:58.270
I guess, Mococo-chan.

18:58.631 --> 19:01.033
But I take very good care of it.

19:01.994 --> 19:04.116
But now, I'm even puffier!

19:04.136 --> 19:08.078
Moco-chan's even puffier!

19:15.198 --> 19:16.479
It makes me really happy.

19:16.739 --> 19:22.242
And it makes me really happy that you noticed, Ruffians.

19:22.642 --> 19:29.225
Please continue to notice my changes and improvements just like you would in a tree in the Four Seasons.

19:29.525 --> 19:30.225
Okay!

19:31.326 --> 19:32.046
I'm not a tree.

19:32.446 --> 19:33.787
I'm a demon dog!

19:34.227 --> 19:38.289
BAU BAU!

19:38.949 --> 19:40.530
Moco-chan's voice is fuzzy.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.211
It's extra fuzzy today.

19:45.023 --> 19:45.903
BAU BAU!

19:47.644 --> 19:49.005
I have a suggestion.

19:49.385 --> 19:55.128
It may be you like the normal fuzzy Moco-chan without the fuzzy voice.

19:56.588 --> 19:59.169
Actually, did you hear it?

20:00.390 --> 20:03.532
There's a way that you can hear FUWAMOCO-chan more!

20:03.832 --> 20:09.536
Because earlier this month, we participated in a new voice pack!

20:09.716 --> 20:11.597
BAU BAU!

20:11.677 --> 20:15.579
It's the hololive academy voice pack, The Entrance Arc.

20:17.481 --> 20:21.804
This time, you know, it's a little bit different from the previous voice packs.

20:22.224 --> 20:25.246
It's in a world that's slightly different from our own.

20:25.807 --> 20:32.472
And you, Ruffians, you've been hired to be a new teacher at the hololive Academy!

20:32.572 --> 20:35.554
What kind of antics will we pull you into?

20:35.614 --> 20:38.757
You know, will you do all that as a crying teacher?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.720
And will you school us and make us do our schoolwork?

20:45.524 --> 20:47.445
Nice!

20:47.745 --> 20:51.886
And you see, this is Volume 1, it's the Ending Arc.

20:51.987 --> 20:58.869
It's a new series, so you'll have to check out what kind of, how the story unfolds from here on out.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.061
What did you think, Ruffians?

21:02.101 --> 21:02.502
Do it here!

21:02.522 --> 21:04.203
You teach it, yeah!

21:04.223 --> 21:06.724
He told on us all the time.

21:06.764 --> 21:07.044
BAU BAU

21:20.173 --> 21:22.337
Please check it out on FUWAMOCO!

21:22.537 --> 21:26.123
We're really excited for the next part of the day!

21:26.724 --> 21:31.011
BAU BAU!

21:31.532 --> 21:33.595
And the cute Bijou here is so cute!

21:34.761 --> 21:35.282
BAU BAU!

21:50.162 --> 21:51.583
How's the nostalgic feel?

21:52.244 --> 21:57.191
BAU BAU!

21:57.611 --> 22:01.196
It's been a little while, but... Ruffians!

22:01.857 --> 22:03.959
We got a scoop on the Ruffians!

22:09.786 --> 22:14.790
Thank you so much to Uncle Rupi for the impeccable journalism!

22:14.870 --> 22:17.092
BAU BAU!

22:17.172 --> 22:18.953
Let's take a look!

22:19.734 --> 22:26.699
Wow, it seems like Poruru-oneechan, she's made an unexpected new friend!

22:27.199 --> 22:27.880
I'm this friend.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.803
He's funny and ugly, and that's why his name is the Fuggler.

22:33.523 --> 22:34.704
FUWA!

22:35.504 --> 22:43.609
Moco-chan, you're not going to get jealous again like you did when Poruru-oneechan gave Mumei-senpai a big hug during the 3D, right?

22:44.189 --> 22:50.493
No, but, I mean, it makes sense that Poruru-oneechan would make new friends, but... Yeah?

22:52.234 --> 22:53.234
Actually... Huh?

22:53.874 --> 22:54.735
I want to say!

22:54.835 --> 22:54.955
No.

22:55.555 --> 22:55.716
Huh?

22:57.378 --> 23:00.119
How do I look similar to someone I know?

23:01.079 --> 23:01.319
Huh?

23:02.319 --> 23:05.420
It's Fuwawa in the lighting!

23:05.580 --> 23:06.420
Huh?!

23:06.640 --> 23:06.900
Huh?!

23:07.580 --> 23:09.241
I don't look like that in the lighting.

23:09.381 --> 23:11.601
It's the exact same.

23:11.661 --> 23:11.822
Huh?

23:11.882 --> 23:13.482
Moco-chan, are you sure that's not you?

23:13.502 --> 23:15.022
No way.

23:15.302 --> 23:16.103
You sure?

23:16.403 --> 23:16.743
Yeah.

23:16.963 --> 23:17.823
After all, you know.

23:17.843 --> 23:19.343
I don't look anything the same.

23:20.104 --> 23:20.644
Wait, wait.

23:20.784 --> 23:21.424
Moco-chan.

23:24.004 --> 23:24.265
Wow.

23:24.985 --> 23:25.845
It's not the same.

23:27.901 --> 23:28.702
I don't know.

23:28.722 --> 23:31.485
Ruffians!

23:31.505 --> 23:35.068
Don't listen to Moco-chan, okay?

23:35.248 --> 23:41.254
You know, Moco-chan, you really shouldn't say things like that though because it'll cause more misunderstandings.

23:41.715 --> 23:45.979
BAU BAU!

23:46.019 --> 23:46.580
BAU BAU.

23:50.114 --> 23:50.875
BAU BAU!

23:50.935 --> 23:53.537
I'm happy Poruru-oneechan has a new friend!

23:53.557 --> 23:57.660
BAU BAU!

24:01.283 --> 24:06.126
BAU BAU!

24:08.988 --> 24:10.069
It's the middle of the week.

24:10.810 --> 24:14.012
Maybe it's been a little bit of a rough week, Ruffians.

24:16.061 --> 24:16.521
Moco-chan.

24:17.442 --> 24:22.646
Do you think you have something that you can give us a little bit more pup?

24:25.609 --> 24:26.449
I don't know.

24:27.891 --> 24:28.831
Maybe.

24:28.992 --> 24:29.312
Maybe.

24:29.372 --> 24:35.157
Ruffians!

24:36.337 --> 24:36.958
Ruffians!

24:38.099 --> 24:38.259
Hi.

24:44.770 --> 24:48.553
Are you ready for some raspy motivation?

24:51.876 --> 24:53.557
Did you have a funny feeling?

24:53.577 --> 24:58.921
That today is a bit different than usual?

25:00.443 --> 25:04.386
Well, that's because it's that day of the week!

25:05.086 --> 25:08.990
Once again, it's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

25:10.171 --> 25:13.353
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

25:17.942 --> 25:18.923
Ruffians!

25:19.723 --> 25:21.164
Have you been feeling okay?

25:21.184 --> 25:27.409
Do you feel a bit... under the weather?

25:27.429 --> 25:32.953
Do you feel a bit... Rasputin?

25:35.775 --> 25:38.997
Are you sure?

25:39.718 --> 25:45.082
Do allergies really... really have their hold on you?

25:48.756 --> 25:54.957
I know it can be tough, but despite feeling out of it, you're doing your best to continue.

25:54.997 --> 25:56.558
You're strong.

25:57.198 --> 25:57.838
You're raw.

25:58.678 --> 26:00.118
Nothing is gonna take you out.

26:01.239 --> 26:05.660
But you know, part of that is knowing when it's time to take a rest.

26:06.620 --> 26:13.402
That way, you can make sure you're at top strength and ready to keep going, despite feeling a bit off.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.113
Remember!

26:15.973 --> 26:17.334
I'm cheering for you!

26:18.355 --> 26:20.516
Fuwawa is still cheering for you!

26:20.576 --> 26:21.597
BAU BAU!

26:22.077 --> 26:26.760
Pero... It's probably even cheering for you too.

26:27.441 --> 26:30.723
So let's give it our all and just take it day by day, okay?

26:31.504 --> 26:32.344
Ganbatte de!

26:32.384 --> 26:33.025
BAU BAU!

26:36.536 --> 26:40.100
BAU BAU!

26:40.281 --> 26:42.503
It's FUWAMOCO-chan!

26:43.004 --> 26:44.706
Hang in there, Ruffians!

26:44.826 --> 26:46.648
Hang in there, Mococo-chan!

26:48.811 --> 26:50.653
BAU BAU!

26:50.713 --> 26:54.197
Let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day today!

26:55.018 --> 26:59.902
For the Doggie of the Day, we have... De-den!

27:00.062 --> 27:04.106
Today's Doggie of the Day is Elrond and Bero!

27:04.166 --> 27:04.846
So cute!

27:05.187 --> 27:06.968
Is it their birthday?

27:07.328 --> 27:10.391
Yeah, you know, actually it was.

27:10.551 --> 27:11.612
But they're not twins.

27:11.992 --> 27:16.496
But they celebrate their birthdays together because they're good brothers.

27:17.397 --> 27:19.398
Look at the cute costumes!

27:20.419 --> 27:25.720
Apparently though, Beowulf wasn't a fan until he saw all the treats he was gonna be getting.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.781
Gotta change things.

27:27.801 --> 27:30.181
That makes sense.

27:30.221 --> 27:31.021
Right?

27:31.121 --> 27:32.642
Look how fluffy they are!

27:32.722 --> 27:33.322
Right!

27:33.382 --> 27:34.462
Fuzzy too.

27:34.482 --> 27:35.722
I love the little eyes!

27:36.442 --> 27:37.663
And the glasses!

27:39.723 --> 27:42.504
Well, how do you think they BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

27:44.986 --> 27:49.231
Happy birthday, BAU BAU!

27:49.992 --> 27:53.936
Happy birthday, BAU BAU!

27:54.637 --> 27:55.398
Happy bir-

27:56.161 --> 27:56.721
De-den!

27:56.801 --> 27:58.262
BAU BAU!

27:58.302 --> 28:01.002
Moco-chan, I don't think that's how they BAU BAU, but that's okay.

28:02.823 --> 28:03.503
BAU BAU!

28:03.543 --> 28:06.964
BAU BAU!

28:07.724 --> 28:14.346
Well, we're wishing a super duper happy birthday to both Amber and Beelzebub.

28:14.946 --> 28:21.308
Please stay fluffy and fuzzy, and don't let the sudden costumes in your life get you down.

28:21.388 --> 28:22.228
What does that mean?

28:22.669 --> 28:23.829
It means exactly what it means.

28:25.653 --> 28:29.835
You know, you never know, there could always be lots of cheats around the corner.

28:29.855 --> 28:35.638
BAU BAU!

28:35.698 --> 28:38.279
Next, Ruffians, you've been going for walks, right?

28:39.180 --> 28:41.341
Let's see where you went for a walk this time.

28:41.581 --> 28:41.761
No.

28:43.042 --> 28:44.002
What's the corner?

28:44.022 --> 28:49.545
Today, I went on a walk.

28:51.288 --> 28:53.169
You got it!

28:53.189 --> 28:53.529
BAU BAU!

28:53.549 --> 28:56.711
Let's see it for real this time.

28:57.571 --> 29:00.252
De-den!

29:00.612 --> 29:02.133
Cute!

29:02.353 --> 29:04.714
Chiranugo!

29:05.114 --> 29:06.055
Chiranugo!

29:06.195 --> 29:07.836
Chiranugo!

29:07.856 --> 29:09.937
That's so cute!

29:09.997 --> 29:11.497
Moco-chan, you shouldn't say that!

29:13.378 --> 29:15.020
Nene-chi!

29:15.200 --> 29:16.781
Not Nene-chi-senpai!

29:17.061 --> 29:19.523
Watch out, Nene-chi is gonna get you, Moco-chan!

29:19.543 --> 29:20.224
Nene-chi!

29:20.444 --> 29:22.325
My similar to Ryan!

29:22.866 --> 29:25.007
Chinamekore!

29:25.067 --> 29:28.610
We've never seen them before, you know?

29:28.630 --> 29:33.474
Hopefully, you know, we can go to the clams sometime soon and see them!

29:33.774 --> 29:34.835
Yeah!

29:34.895 --> 29:37.917
We'd like to see what the Chinamekore is!

29:38.058 --> 29:38.218
Yeah!

29:39.443 --> 29:41.083
I feel like they're very peaceful.

29:41.323 --> 29:42.064
Peaceful.

29:42.084 --> 29:47.385
I don't know, there's the one in the front that's kind of stripy and the ones in the back that aren't.

29:47.945 --> 29:48.765
There's lots of them.

29:48.785 --> 29:50.685
There's polka dots.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.366
Ah, polka dots too.

29:52.886 --> 29:53.426
Polka dots.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.366
BAU BAU!

29:57.787 --> 29:58.787
BAU BAU!

29:58.907 --> 30:00.587
They're so cute, right?

30:00.907 --> 30:03.708
What are they, uh, garden eels?

30:07.634 --> 30:15.504
We actually received a Ruffian.

30:16.265 --> 30:18.768
No Question of the Day we received a Ruffian.

30:19.810 --> 30:20.270
BAU BAU!

30:22.878 --> 30:24.119
The Ruffian quit!

30:24.860 --> 30:27.642
And now, we get a whole Ruffian!

30:27.662 --> 30:31.965
We get a whole Ruffian, Moco-chan!

30:32.105 --> 30:34.547
Now, we got a question!

30:35.188 --> 30:36.729
Yeah, another Ruffian.

30:37.290 --> 30:40.132
Let's see what our Question of the Day is today!

30:41.273 --> 30:41.453
Oh!

30:41.873 --> 30:43.234
Hi FUWAMOCO!

30:43.375 --> 30:46.097
Congratulations on the move!

30:46.177 --> 30:50.040
What Japanese foods have become some of your favorites besides ponzu?

30:51.104 --> 30:53.245
Classic Japanese food, huh?

30:54.565 --> 30:55.966
Ordering!

30:56.346 --> 30:59.287
Or any you'd like to master cooking someday.

30:59.307 --> 31:06.450
We haven't really had the time to have a really nice meal or anything, you know?

31:07.290 --> 31:07.610
FUWAMOCO

31:24.874 --> 31:26.156
Indian Club!

31:26.557 --> 31:28.199
Mark in the Northwest Passage.

31:28.219 --> 31:38.012
I know there's some very, very yummy places with authentic flavors, but for some reason, it's sort of better in some ways in Japan.

31:38.413 --> 31:38.853
Yeah.

31:38.993 --> 31:39.334
Some ways.

31:41.318 --> 31:41.778
I know!

31:41.798 --> 31:44.760
Naan bread.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.821
Moco-chan, you really like the naan bread.

31:47.261 --> 31:47.461
Yes!

31:48.142 --> 31:48.662
I know it.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.203
It's so fresh!

31:50.863 --> 31:52.044
Intense!

31:52.104 --> 31:53.044
It's huge!

31:53.244 --> 31:54.545
I make it for you!

31:54.565 --> 31:58.087
I feel like it shouldn't be allowed to be that big!

31:58.687 --> 32:07.672
But... The curry you had... It's super sweet.

32:09.164 --> 32:12.366
Like something you put on ice cream.

32:12.846 --> 32:13.546
Yeah.

32:14.166 --> 32:14.507
Yeah.

32:14.687 --> 32:16.668
Really, really sweet.

32:17.128 --> 32:17.448
Yeah.

32:17.668 --> 32:22.791
And as FUWAMOCO, we're really not good with spice.

32:23.031 --> 32:24.191
We're pretty weak.

32:24.812 --> 32:29.474
But it would be nice if it tasted a bit more spicy.

32:29.874 --> 32:30.234
Yeah.

32:30.394 --> 32:31.735
And not just like syrup.

32:31.835 --> 32:32.495
Dessert.

32:32.755 --> 32:33.136
Yeah.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.821
Not too spicy, too sweet.

32:37.262 --> 32:38.483
It's too sweet!

32:38.963 --> 32:40.764
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.185
It's like pink sauce.

32:42.225 --> 32:44.387
Pink sauce, yeah.

32:44.547 --> 32:48.390
Yeah, it's a bit of a funny occurrence.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.002
BAU BAU!

32:53.103 --> 32:55.265
Maybe we can find some spicy curry.

32:55.586 --> 32:56.487
But not too spicy.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.229
Because we don't like spicy!

32:58.269 --> 32:59.631
But it should taste sweet!

32:59.651 --> 33:00.672
Ice cream curry!

33:01.493 --> 33:02.194
BAU BAU!

33:02.214 --> 33:02.634
No thank you.

33:08.181 --> 33:10.642
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

33:11.062 --> 33:15.483
Thank you for all your submissions with the hashtag!

33:15.623 --> 33:17.724
Hashtag FWMCMorning!

33:18.064 --> 33:21.665
And thank you for FUWAMOCO's group as well.

33:21.685 --> 33:23.185
We're always looking!

33:23.645 --> 33:24.766
So please let us know.

33:24.886 --> 33:27.806
Oh, today I went on a walk and I stepped in a puddle.

33:27.826 --> 33:29.427
Where, you know...

33:30.227 --> 33:35.148
Oh, FUWAMOCO, I wonder, I wonder if you've been thinking about this and what you think about this.

33:35.368 --> 33:36.848
Those kind of things.

33:36.888 --> 33:38.609
My dog sounds like Mococo!

33:38.649 --> 33:40.469
Those kind of things.

33:40.509 --> 33:42.869
Please let us know, okay?

33:42.909 --> 33:47.430
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make together, so we're waiting, okay?

33:47.450 --> 33:48.570
BAU BAU!

33:49.031 --> 33:52.611

BAU BAU!

33:57.152 --> 34:03.217
For our next theme, we have... De-den!

34:03.397 --> 34:07.360
We're playing school albums together with all of our fans!

34:08.020 --> 34:15.746
It's gonna be all our first time, but I'm looking forward to it because, you know, Moco-chan, we're demon guard dogs.

34:16.507 --> 34:17.668
We're brave, right?

34:18.348 --> 34:20.930
And now it's time to show just how brave we are.

34:21.070 --> 34:23.172
Why am I crying in the thumbnail?

34:24.313 --> 34:25.874
Because we're being brave, that's why.

34:30.012 --> 34:38.058
We'll show everybody that FUWAMOCO is the bravest demon guard dogs in all of Advent, right?

34:38.259 --> 34:41.061
BAU BAU!

34:42.442 --> 34:45.024
And we take a look at this week's schedule.

34:45.404 --> 34:48.827
Well, this weekend we have our Rock n' Rawr Party.

34:48.847 --> 34:56.313
We are really looking forward to it, but unfortunately, you know, Mococo-chan was kind of under the weather with a really bad migraine.

34:56.673 --> 35:03.879
But it's okay because we're gonna be singing a bunch of our favorite anime songs, so we hope you'll be there with us on Saturday!

35:03.899 --> 35:06.782
But one day before that, on Friday!

35:06.802 --> 35:15.229
At 6AM PT or 9AM ET, we're gonna be doing our first off collab with Koyori-senpai!

35:15.449 --> 35:17.450
We're gonna be doing even more singing too!

35:17.510 --> 35:20.133
We were just seeing on Twitter that we need to run away.

35:20.153 --> 35:22.535
I don't know why we need to run away.

35:25.862 --> 35:25.982
BAU!

35:26.022 --> 35:28.824
We have FUWAMOCO Morning with Koyori-senpai!

35:29.365 --> 35:31.887
Our first guest, so we're really looking forward to it.

35:31.907 --> 35:35.370
Maybe we'll have Koyori-senpai introduce some special corners this time.

35:53.044 --> 35:56.966
We hope that you'll be there to start the day off on the right paw again!

35:56.986 --> 35:57.766
BAU BAU!

35:57.846 --> 36:00.928
