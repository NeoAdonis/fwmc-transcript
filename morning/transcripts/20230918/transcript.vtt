00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.625
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.396
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:18.158
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.220
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.342
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:26.123
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:26.303 --> 00:04:29.045
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:30.486
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:38.414
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:45.322
Thank you for joining us today for our 21st FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:45.402
Wow.

00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:49.805
I'm excited.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:50.125
21st?

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:50.245
22nd?

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:52.266
I feel like we'll be at 100 soon.

00:04:53.487 --> 00:04:57.809
It hasn't been very long to get to 21, so you know 100 will be here before we know it.

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:58.529
Right.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.271
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us.

00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:04.973
But for any new Ruffians, please let us introduce FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:05.593
One minute early.

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:05.673
Huh?

00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:05.753
Huh?

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:08.755
Are we a minute early?

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:08.815
No?

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:08.895
Yes?

00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:15.438
Yes?

00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:19.561
Yes.

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:30.339
This is what happens when I let Fuwawa look at the time!

00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:37.929
No, Ruffians, you're joking.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.369
Yes.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:47.834
Well, to explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:49.454
Moco-chan.

00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:54.084
Why is it Friday, Wednesday, Monday?

00:05:54.244 --> 00:05:54.585
Yes.

00:05:55.726 --> 00:05:57.829
Cause that spells FUWAMOCO.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.574
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:07.261
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:08.482 --> 00:06:13.103
I just kind of started out on a bit of a... It's still on my paw!

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.803
It's just a bit different.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:16.644
Different fingers on the paw.

00:06:16.684 --> 00:06:18.604
Different finger we started with.

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:24.045
Ruffians, please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:29.446
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.327
BAU BAU!

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:33.187
Well, Ruffians,

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:39.604
I wonder if there's been... There has been!

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:42.625
Is it a question?

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.626
Let's see.

00:06:45.987 --> 00:06:46.967
A rice field.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:52.449
It seems like a Ruffian spotted Pero while they're working hard harvesting rice.

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:54.470
What do you mean Pero working hard?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.351
No, the Ruffian was working hard.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:59.112
Pero's never working hard.

00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:01.472
That's so cool.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:03.173
For you, Ruffian, not for Pero.

00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:03.453
No.

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:08.414
But it does seem like maybe Pero just came out of nowhere and offered to help, though.

00:07:08.454 --> 00:07:10.694
If he's actually helping, that's nice, I guess.

00:07:10.714 --> 00:07:16.055
That's a bit unexpected of him, but... You know, maybe Pero wanted to experience something new, you know?

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:20.076
Like, last time, you know, he was driving the forklift?

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:22.776
This time, harvesting rice.

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:27.117
You know, it's kind of like a cultural experience, right?

00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:28.617
You know, make yourself more of a

00:07:29.037 --> 00:07:29.998
Well-rounded person, right?

00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:32.399
Well-rounded person experiences, you know.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:43.184
But it does seem that Pero kind of wanted to eat the rice and maybe was a little bit disappointed when he found out that he wouldn't be able to because it needs to dry for cheese first, right?

00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:44.224
You have to dry it.

00:07:44.404 --> 00:07:46.025
You can't just eat it and die.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.106
Silly Pero.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:50.507
But you know everything worthwhile takes time, right?

00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:51.568
Yeah, yummy rice.

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:55.916
Oh, I guess, you know, we could say, uh, Pero.

00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.197
Pero wa inekari shite ita.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.038
Inekare wo shite ita.

00:07:59.058 --> 00:07:59.258
Inukare?

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.679
Inukare shite ita.

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:01.380
You know what?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.202
Use some of the new Nihongo that we learned in Kanji de go de yabete.

00:08:05.222 --> 00:08:05.342
Ateru?

00:08:05.362 --> 00:08:06.163
Ateru kana?

00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:07.004
Is that right?

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:07.464
Not inukare.

00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:08.244
Inukare janakute ne.

00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:08.385
Why?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:08.465
Ah.

00:08:22.054 --> 00:08:24.616
But, you know, I think it's really cool though.

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:29.400
Wouldn't you like to kind of be able to help harvest the rice?

00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:32.062
I like to try harvesting the rice.

00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:35.345
Not just harvesting though, I like to try planting too, you know.

00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:36.106
It seems fun.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:37.307
More experiences, right?

00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:42.872
Right, you have to get into the field and have a little watering.

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:44.033
Ah, but there'll be frogs.

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:45.434
Ah, there'll be frogs.

00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:48.579
Ruffians, please let us know if you see Pero around again, okay?

00:09:12.297 --> 00:09:16.300
Remember to let us know using the hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.262
BAU BAU!

00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:25.767
Well, Ruffians, we have some good news!

00:09:25.888 --> 00:09:27.689
Something important to share!

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:34.775
Over the weekend, our first cover song, Kaibutsu, reached 2 million views!

00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:35.415
BAU BAU!

00:09:39.782 --> 00:09:43.983
Thank you so much for all your love and support, Ruffians!

00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:44.803
Thank you!

00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:46.884
We worked really hard on recording.

00:09:46.944 --> 00:09:48.864
It was really tricky, right, Moco-chan?

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:49.164
It was!

00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:52.785
Yeah, we put a lot of our emotion and feeling into it.

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:54.965
It was a bit of a new experience.

00:09:55.225 --> 00:09:55.946
Right!

00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:57.326
Lots of harmonies.

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:02.047
We wanted to do something a little bit different from your song, right?

00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:18.269
We challenged ourselves, but I'm not sure Ruffians, maybe you remember, maybe you don't, but when it first premiered on the day that we debuted, there was a translation that actually FUWAMOCO did for it.

00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:19.991
We wanted to share the meaning

00:10:20.051 --> 00:10:25.852
We hope that you'll listen to it lots and lots, and hopefully our feelings can reach you through our voices that way.

00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:47.632
Don't wait, don't wait!

00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:51.154
Thank you for the congratulations!

00:10:51.214 --> 00:10:55.117
Thank you, Ruffians, for listening to it lots and lots.

00:10:55.177 --> 00:11:04.303
No, maybe we're a bit silly, but we put a lot of thought into our delivery and how we wanted to deliver certain parts of the song.

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:11.928
Even if we can't have a translation, we hope that those will reach you in the heart and the brain.

00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:15.370
We're really excited to release our next cover song too.

00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:21.433
We hope that you enjoy that just as much as Kaibutsu Medical Show.

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:21.793
Right?

00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:25.474
Next time's gonna be a little bit of a different challenge, right?

00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:27.955
Challenge.

00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:28.816
Challenge.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:31.977
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:11:32.137 --> 00:11:33.017
BAU BAU!

00:11:33.057 --> 00:11:36.999
We have some more good news for you, Moco-chan.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.160
Ruffians.

00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.942
De-den!

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:49.726
There's no misunderstandings!

00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:51.907
Can we still say that?

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:53.347
We can, you know!

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:55.468
Even though you made us start a minute early.

00:11:56.408 --> 00:11:58.869
Yes.

00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:02.990
We went another day without any misunderstandings.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.090
Apparently!

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.991
Aren't you proud of us, Ruffians?

00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:07.811
You're proud!

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:08.772
Why?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:09.452
You're proud.

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:10.292
You're proud.

00:12:10.472 --> 00:12:12.693
The nose I'm seeing means, yeah!

00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:13.193
Right?

00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:14.693
You know, yeah!

00:12:14.794 --> 00:12:15.754
FUWAMOCO did it!

00:12:16.614 --> 00:12:17.814
You're proud of us, right?

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:20.355
They did it, right?

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:22.636
You're proud of us, right?

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:24.356
I keep on saying no way!

00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:25.696
No way!

00:12:26.116 --> 00:12:27.197
You're not proud of us!

00:12:27.217 --> 00:12:29.797
You're not proud.

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:32.498
I'm so proud.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:32.978
Tears.

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:36.039
So proud that I moved to tears, Moco-chan.

00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:38.203
Happy.

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:39.303
Happy.

00:12:40.104 --> 00:12:43.805
You know, we're gonna do our best to keep this streak up.

00:12:44.386 --> 00:12:45.506
Right?

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:47.227
We'll do our best, right, Moco-chan?

00:12:47.487 --> 00:12:47.727
Yeah.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.508
Less misunderstandings.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.229
That's good for everyone, right?

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:52.310
Good for everyone.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:13:00.434
But I'm actually a bit concerned, though, because we're playing card and phone with all of Average today, so... No misunderstandings!

00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:01.895
Could be a bit risky.

00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:03.396
It'll be good.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.397
No risk, no misunderstandings.

00:13:05.437 --> 00:13:05.837
We're good.

00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:07.839
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:09.760
I'm so glad, you know.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.502
The Ruffians look so proud.

00:13:12.443 --> 00:13:13.584
All those tears.

00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:15.806
Proud yet devastated.

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:19.710
BAU BAU!

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.113
Well, well.

00:13:23.894 --> 00:13:24.575
Actually.

00:13:25.736 --> 00:13:28.258
Well, there wasn't a misunderstanding, but...

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:34.143
We wanted to make a formal apology, Ruffians.

00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:35.645
It's not my apology.

00:13:37.186 --> 00:13:38.887
And it wasn't a misunderstanding.

00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:42.090
Maybe I have to make a formal apology, right?

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.932
Right, you're gonna apologize.

00:13:44.612 --> 00:13:51.698
So, the other day, Fuwawa misspoke and said something.

00:13:54.673 --> 00:14:00.395
You know, while we were playing Kanji de Go, we were doing our best to read lots of complicated kanji, right?

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:07.577
So, naturally, there's some 4-moji-juku-go that showed up, right?

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.498
Yeah.

00:14:10.518 --> 00:14:11.458
4-moji-juku-go.

00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:16.779
It's sort of a Japanese compound word that consists of four kanji characters.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.820
And a lot of times it's idioms.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.781
So, like for example, you know this one.

00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:24.961
Huh?

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:29.088
It looks complicated, but it's not.

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.709
It's not that.

00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:35.179
Yeah, we have it in English too.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.823
It's two birds with one stone.

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:39.029
You know what?

00:14:39.209 --> 00:14:40.650
The first kanji is for one.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.432
The next is for stone.

00:14:43.012 --> 00:14:44.733
The next after that is two.

00:14:45.194 --> 00:14:46.174
And the last is bird.

00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:47.875
So it's not hard!

00:14:47.935 --> 00:14:49.036
It's super easy, right?

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:50.897
Kill two birds with one stone.

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:53.339
It makes sense.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.641
Two birds with one bee-bullet!

00:15:00.013 --> 00:15:01.194
But the hard part.

00:15:01.374 --> 00:15:04.155
Yeah, they have really good meanings though, right, Moco-chan?

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:05.275
It's really beautiful.

00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:05.955
Yeah.

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:13.238
But that's not the part that Fuwawa messed up on.

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:13.818
Ms.

00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:20.400
Bulg was actually saying YOMOJIJUKUGO.

00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:27.763
And she referred to it as... YOMOJIJUKUGO.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.251
I told you to repeat it, Moco-chan.

00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:33.271
I'm just trying to clear up.

00:15:33.512 --> 00:15:37.933
You're supposed to apologize, not me!

00:15:37.973 --> 00:15:40.054
What does that mean, Moco-chan?

00:15:41.894 --> 00:15:46.115
For a character who out-is ladies or nothing.

00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:49.897
You should be ashamed.

00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:51.557
Ashamed!

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.078
The Ruffians are laughing at you too!

00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.295
What do you have to say?

00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:03.916
Well, you know, I'm sorry.

00:16:03.936 --> 00:16:09.178
I'm sorry for my horrible, inappropriate slip of the tongue, you know.

00:16:09.978 --> 00:16:12.199
Japanese language is really beautiful.

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:14.540
It should be taken very seriously.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.682
But I get that it's sometimes hard to say some things right.

00:16:17.702 --> 00:16:18.842
It's hard to say.

00:16:18.862 --> 00:16:19.983
Just like, dog curry.

00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:21.323
Dog curry, yeah.

00:16:22.323 --> 00:16:28.266
But I hope that, you know, all the 4-10-5s can forgive me, you know.

00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:30.294
They're cool!

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:31.555
It's BAU!

00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.477
You know, Ichigo Ichie!

00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:35.438
You know, Jyurin Toiro!

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.801
They're cool!

00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:42.405
They're cool, but you make sure your tongue is okay.

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:44.967
No more mess-ups.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.429
I'll do my best.

00:16:46.489 --> 00:16:47.129
Good!

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.471
Good!

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.822
Apology accepted!

00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:51.522
You good now?

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.305
I don't know, you have to ask the kanji.

00:16:53.385 --> 00:16:54.186
Understood!

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:54.526
I'm good.

00:16:54.626 --> 00:16:55.787
BAU BAU!

00:17:12.383 --> 00:17:17.707
Kind of have a bit of a confession to... A little bit.

00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:25.896
It's a bit hard to talk about, so that's why we're gonna confess to you today, Ruffians.

00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:28.397
Ah, Moco-chan, can you talk about it?

00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:30.378
Because it's... It's very difficult.

00:17:30.398 --> 00:17:43.586
Okay, so... I guess a few FUWAMOCO Mornings ago, I can't remember how long ago, but we talked about our game consoles that Ruffians have.

00:17:45.313 --> 00:17:49.034
But we actually didn't include a certain one.

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:55.136
To be honest, it was kind of on purpose.

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:57.757
Yeah, it's painful to talk about.

00:17:58.157 --> 00:17:59.917
Yeah, it's a bit painful.

00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:04.939
It was our Sega Dreamcast.

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:09.180
There's many reasons.

00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:12.736
That we don't think about it.

00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:14.979
We try not to think about it the best we can.

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:16.160
Don't talk about it.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.065
And we really love it!

00:18:20.105 --> 00:18:21.747
I loved it!

00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:37.911
And you know, the Dreamcast is just somewhat of like a dream-like game console, and we'd really like to play it more.

00:18:38.571 --> 00:18:40.352
We would have liked to play it more.

00:18:40.372 --> 00:18:43.513
But yeah, we try not to think about it.

00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:47.776
Dreamcast.

00:18:47.936 --> 00:18:49.497
We don't know where it went.

00:18:50.437 --> 00:18:51.458
It just disappeared.

00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:54.926
It was really special to us.

00:18:55.727 --> 00:18:57.809
Not just something you can buy and replace.

00:18:57.829 --> 00:18:59.570
It was a special ToriCastle.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.032
So, we're not gonna think about it.

00:19:04.233 --> 00:19:07.416
And that's why we didn't mention it to you, Ruffians.

00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:11.119
Because we didn't want to make you sad about it either.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.561
We tried not to think about it.

00:19:13.781 --> 00:19:14.562
It's difficult.

00:19:14.722 --> 00:19:15.883
It's hard.

00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:18.945
Thank you for understanding.

00:19:20.546 --> 00:19:21.067
Understand?

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.524
Well, Moco-chan, you know, it's a new week.

00:19:27.104 --> 00:19:29.406
It's a new week, let's forget about that.

00:19:30.267 --> 00:19:33.349
And you know, it's the start of a new week.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.930
We're gonna make it a good one!

00:19:35.271 --> 00:19:35.931
Right, Ruffians?

00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:37.152
It's gonna be a good one!

00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:44.758
So, you know, I think it would be good if we challenged ourselves to do something new.

00:19:45.379 --> 00:19:45.779
Right!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:47.921
Something...

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:51.379
Today, Moco-chan, you're gonna be challenging once more

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:19.372
Eat natto!

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:22.975
Ruffians, you know, maybe you're not too sure what natto is.

00:20:22.995 --> 00:20:24.917
Maybe you've heard of it, but what was that again?

00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:26.998
It's a common breakfast food in Japan.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.000
It's fermented soybeans.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:37.927
It can be rather sticky and slimy, a bit strong smelling, but it's really, really, really, really healthy for you.

00:20:38.787 --> 00:20:42.913
I want to eat it, but... It's difficult for me.

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:46.917
So Moco-chan is going to conquer her dislike for it.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:53.225
So you know, Moco-chan, that way you can continue to protect the Ruffian smile for many, many years to come.

00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:54.627
Just like me!

00:20:55.107 --> 00:20:56.869
Just like Fuwawa, you know?

00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:01.972
Just earlier, before FUWAMOCO Morning, we were able to call in Polka-senpai.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:02.412
Poruru-oneechan.

00:21:17.245 --> 00:21:19.086
Right, she's gonna go to sleep.

00:21:19.526 --> 00:21:22.387
Yeah, before she goes to sleep.

00:21:23.127 --> 00:21:26.788
And we talked to her about natto.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.589
Yeah, Pororo-nee-san likes natto.

00:21:29.629 --> 00:21:29.989
Yeah.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:35.111
So then, I said, you know, today, I would eat the one bean for Pororo-nee-chan.

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:45.288
I'm sort of worried.

00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:46.309
Oi!

00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:47.429
Oi!

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:51.250
Did you... Get ahead of yourself, Moco-chan?

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.731
I have to make sure I swallow it.

00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:57.192
But for the onee-san's sake, why?

00:21:57.592 --> 00:21:58.212
Why?

00:21:58.232 --> 00:21:59.632
Well... Okay!

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:00.813
Moco-chan.

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:05.654
First, before we eat it... Before you eat it.

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:06.534
I can't eat it?

00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:08.135
This is Moco-chan's challenge.

00:22:08.635 --> 00:22:09.275
I'll eat it.

00:22:09.315 --> 00:22:10.195
Don't let her down!

00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:11.656
Don't put pressure on me!

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:12.656
But first...

00:22:13.756 --> 00:22:18.158
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard today.

00:22:18.178 --> 00:22:19.259
Thank you, I'm gonna eat it.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:23.721
Not for the farmers in Tochigi, but for Poruru-oneechan, okay?

00:22:27.574 --> 00:22:31.535
But I'm sure you'll make the farmers and tochis very happy too, you know?

00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:34.256
Today, I have my tissue.

00:22:35.077 --> 00:22:36.817
I'm in control of the tissue.

00:22:37.337 --> 00:22:38.498
I'm not Fuwawa.

00:22:38.638 --> 00:22:41.359
I'm gonna try not to get this over with.

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:46.201
But I'm also sad because it's not my favorite chopsticks.

00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:49.762
I don't like the texture of these chopsticks so I don't use them.

00:22:50.582 --> 00:22:52.503
But everything else is dirty.

00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:59.210
Why are you- Why are you not supposed to- You're not supposed to stir it up!

00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:00.391
No!

00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:02.353
I made a little bit of a hole.

00:23:03.254 --> 00:23:05.257
You have strings everywhere!

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.681
By not having a tare.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.182
Tare is for the weak.

00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:13.244
It's not supposed to be stirred up.

00:23:13.304 --> 00:23:14.285
No soy sauce.

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:25.034
And if you stir it up more, then it gets like, more slimy, more sticky, but healthier too because the natto, the natto... What do they call it?

00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:30.738
The natto... Natto Bacillus Bacterium gets all...

00:23:31.846 --> 00:23:32.566
Activated!

00:23:51.286 --> 00:23:52.787
No, I need to be in control.

00:23:52.847 --> 00:23:53.847
No, you're ready!

00:23:53.907 --> 00:23:54.648
You're ready!

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:57.089
I'm not gonna feed you, Moco-chan.

00:23:57.109 --> 00:23:57.610
No, please don't.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.310
Those days are over.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.133
It's so sticky!

00:24:03.153 --> 00:24:05.034
It smells so good.

00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:08.516
Can you first lick this off for me, please?

00:24:08.636 --> 00:24:10.136
I'm not gonna lick it!

00:24:11.077 --> 00:24:12.157
You should lick it, Moco-chan.

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:13.878
No, I don't want to.

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:15.980
Can you please?

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.380
I'm not!

00:24:18.939 --> 00:24:19.960
Why'd you do this to me?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.460
I have to!

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:20.900
Oh, gosh!

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.702
The chopsticks are all natto.

00:24:23.842 --> 00:24:25.082
Natto, you know?

00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:27.384
Okay, gosh.

00:24:28.284 --> 00:24:31.546
I have to do it for Poruru-oneechan!

00:24:31.786 --> 00:24:32.887
Take that one bean.

00:24:33.407 --> 00:24:35.668
It's Poruru-oneechan's happy face.

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:36.669
It's Porco!

00:24:36.729 --> 00:24:37.489
Right!

00:24:37.649 --> 00:24:39.070
Right!

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:40.371
You see it?

00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:40.991
I see it!

00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:42.132
I see it!

00:24:42.152 --> 00:24:46.854
Moco-chan, don't make that face.

00:24:49.318 --> 00:24:49.939
You can do it!

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:52.280
Strong boy dog!

00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:53.381
Why?

00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:54.142
Okay.

00:24:54.442 --> 00:24:55.042
Ruffians.

00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:56.984
Should I chew it?

00:24:57.264 --> 00:24:58.105
Yes or no?

00:25:02.228 --> 00:25:02.928
I think you should.

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:04.770
Nobisa!

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.332
Nobisa, you can't eat Moco-chan's nut.

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:08.372
She needs to eat it.

00:25:08.713 --> 00:25:08.973
Yes?

00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:09.653
Chew it!

00:25:10.034 --> 00:25:10.714
Chew it!

00:25:10.854 --> 00:25:13.276
You gotta make sure it goes down your throat this time, okay?

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:18.067
I'm eating it for Poruru-oneechan!

00:25:18.447 --> 00:25:19.368
No tissue!

00:25:19.408 --> 00:25:20.849
No, I have tissue!

00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:22.590
I need it for my lips, okay?

00:25:23.611 --> 00:25:26.333
But I'll chew it for the Ruffians, okay?

00:25:26.353 --> 00:25:29.295
Oh, you're gonna eat it for Poruru-oneechan, right?

00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:29.496
Yeah.

00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:31.957
Should I chew it with my... Chew it with what?

00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:33.779
The back of my teeth!

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.081
You're overthinking this, Moco-chan!

00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:38.322
I need to think about it!

00:25:38.362 --> 00:25:40.364
You're getting yourself all scared!

00:25:40.444 --> 00:25:41.745
I need to think about it.

00:25:42.885 --> 00:25:43.266
Yeah!

00:25:45.968 --> 00:25:48.670
Stalling, right?

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.951
I'm not stalling!

00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:50.512
Moco-chan!

00:25:50.912 --> 00:25:53.634
FUWAMOCO Morning is gonna end at this rate!

00:25:54.034 --> 00:25:56.036
No.

00:25:56.416 --> 00:25:57.577
Okay.

00:25:57.777 --> 00:25:59.639
I need my heart to be ready.

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:00.239
Please!

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:01.160
No, don't count!

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.560
Don't count!

00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:02.301
Not yet!

00:26:09.622 --> 00:26:10.182
It's not.

00:26:12.903 --> 00:26:14.924
No, no, no.

00:26:14.964 --> 00:26:16.024
You smelt it.

00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:17.425
Don't make that sound.

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:18.305
That was a mistake.

00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:24.288
Moco-chan!

00:26:24.488 --> 00:26:24.808
Okay.

00:26:26.248 --> 00:26:26.568
Okay.

00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:29.229
Can you have water for me ready at least?

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.550
Just at least.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.631
Only if you actually drink something.

00:26:32.671 --> 00:26:34.171
If I swallow it then, okay?

00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:34.632
Okay.

00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:35.032
Promise.

00:26:35.092 --> 00:26:36.092
Okay, I have it ready.

00:26:36.112 --> 00:26:37.613
I wish it was tea, but it's just water.

00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:38.073
I have it ready.

00:26:39.436 --> 00:26:40.337
You promised, right?

00:26:40.457 --> 00:26:40.817
I promise.

00:26:40.837 --> 00:26:41.777
I don't want to throw up.

00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:44.699
Moco-chan, that's so weird.

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:47.100
I'm just being realistic, okay?

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.981
I'm trying!

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:49.862
Don't think of that.

00:26:49.902 --> 00:26:51.743
Think of Polka Onee-san.

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.684
I'm trying!

00:26:53.764 --> 00:26:54.544
I'm trying!

00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:55.425
Okay.

00:26:55.445 --> 00:26:56.846
Three!

00:26:56.946 --> 00:26:57.646
No, ten.

00:26:58.226 --> 00:26:58.546
Ten.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:26:59.267
I need ten.

00:26:59.287 --> 00:27:01.088
Okay, Ruffians, all together.

00:27:01.608 --> 00:27:02.008
Ten!

00:27:02.328 --> 00:27:02.649
Nine!

00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:02.829
Eight!

00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:04.530
No, no, slower, slower, slower!

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:14.972
1, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

00:27:15.772 --> 00:27:16.952
Oh!

00:27:17.892 --> 00:27:18.052
Oh!

00:27:18.472 --> 00:27:22.273
Oh, the string is... Is it tough to Moco-chan still?

00:27:22.753 --> 00:27:22.833
Oh!

00:27:23.373 --> 00:27:23.493
Oh!

00:27:23.773 --> 00:27:23.893
Oh!

00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:24.594
Oh, she chewed it!

00:27:24.874 --> 00:27:25.354
She chewed it!

00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:26.834
Oh, she's making that face.

00:27:27.454 --> 00:27:29.454
You did it!

00:27:29.594 --> 00:27:31.075
I did it!

00:27:33.817 --> 00:27:36.761
Moco-chan's getting it!

00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:38.223
Water!

00:27:38.343 --> 00:27:39.284
Water!

00:27:39.364 --> 00:27:39.865
Water!

00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:41.207
I need some water!

00:27:41.247 --> 00:27:42.388
I need some water!

00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.472
Moco-chan!

00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:47.435
You eat one bean!

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:47.495
Ah!

00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:51.540
Ah, stuck in my teeth!

00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:54.664
And, and, and... What do you think?

00:27:58.869 --> 00:27:58.969
Water

00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:03.613
What are your thoughts, Moco-chan?

00:28:04.174 --> 00:28:04.975
Is this one bean?

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:06.357
Chewing it was wrong!

00:28:06.377 --> 00:28:07.939
Chewing it was wrong!

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:10.502
No, it's stuck in my teeth!

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.023
Take this!

00:28:11.143 --> 00:28:11.704
Take this!

00:28:11.884 --> 00:28:13.546
I'm not gonna take your chopsticks!

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:14.868
I'm gonna drop it on you!

00:28:14.988 --> 00:28:16.050
Don't drop it on me!

00:28:19.505 --> 00:28:24.450
Every time I try to push it off my teeth and my tongue touches it.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.371
She's good.

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:26.051
She's safe.

00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:26.712
She did it.

00:28:27.313 --> 00:28:29.195
But she's complaining.

00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:30.756
She's complaining.

00:28:31.096 --> 00:28:32.097
She's complaining.

00:28:33.018 --> 00:28:33.739
What did she eat?

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:34.820
She ate natto.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.703
Fermented soybeans because it's really healthy for you.

00:28:37.723 --> 00:28:41.146
And her older sister Fuwawa likes it.

00:28:41.227 --> 00:28:42.007
And her, I guess...

00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:43.509
I did it!

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.812
Moco-chan did it!

00:28:50.692 --> 00:28:52.613
Okay, but I think you should eat some more.

00:28:52.653 --> 00:28:53.014
No!

00:28:53.354 --> 00:28:53.814
Really?

00:28:53.914 --> 00:28:54.335
No!

00:28:54.995 --> 00:28:58.077
Okay, well next time, you have to eat at least three, okay?

00:28:58.478 --> 00:29:03.201
One for me, one for Poyokani, and one for Ruffians.

00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:04.922
Okay, we decided.

00:29:04.942 --> 00:29:06.123
Good job, good job!

00:29:06.163 --> 00:29:08.144
BAU BAU!

00:29:08.184 --> 00:29:11.707
Moco-chan, that seriously took too long, though.

00:29:12.627 --> 00:29:13.488
I did my best.

00:29:13.688 --> 00:29:16.770
Can't keep the Ruffians waiting for you to eat the natto that long.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.521
I did my best.

00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:22.242
BAU BAU!

00:29:23.503 --> 00:29:24.884
Oh, look at the natto color!

00:29:24.904 --> 00:29:26.005
It's super sad!

00:29:26.045 --> 00:29:26.705
BAU BAU!

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:32.169
All right!

00:29:32.189 --> 00:29:33.529
I need to cough it up.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.290
Cough it up?

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.551
Well, that's not as healthy as the natto.

00:29:36.772 --> 00:29:42.615
We're going to today's regular segment!

00:29:43.056 --> 00:29:44.717
Today's Doggie of the Day!

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:47.979
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:55.438
It's Tobi!

00:29:55.538 --> 00:29:59.423
Tobi just had an important surgery.

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:04.450
Ruffians, can we all wish him a big get well soon?

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.831
Get well soon!

00:30:07.313 --> 00:30:11.116
Get well soon, Tobee!

00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:12.777
Tobee, Tobee.

00:30:13.217 --> 00:30:15.138
Although I bet he has cute two beans.

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:18.881
Get well soon, get well soon!

00:30:19.221 --> 00:30:25.025
It's never fun to be healing and need to have a big cold around your head after.

00:30:25.305 --> 00:30:27.467
It's uncomfortable, right?

00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:28.988
Right, Ruffians?

00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:35.950
But you know Tobi, Tobi's making it work with that big smile.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.552
What a trooper.

00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:40.554
Good job Tobi.

00:30:40.735 --> 00:30:42.456
Well how does Tobi BAU BAU?

00:30:42.877 --> 00:30:43.577
I don't think you know.

00:30:43.597 --> 00:30:46.040
He's not really a complainer you know.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.222
Not like Moco-chan eating natto.

00:30:48.582 --> 00:30:52.907
But maybe Tobi has a big strong confident BAU BAU.

00:30:53.287 --> 00:30:53.887
BAU BAU!

00:30:53.927 --> 00:30:54.028
Yeah.

00:30:57.976 --> 00:31:16.414
But you know, I think Toby, Toby's a good boy Won't complain even though he's uncomfortable Has a big core and all It's not fun He's doing his best to be brave and to get all

00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:29.175
Can I have tweets today?

00:31:29.195 --> 00:31:29.235
No.

00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:30.517
No tweets.

00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:32.720
Good luck to all this time!

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.621
BAU BAU!

00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:33.761
Wow!

00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:36.845
Moco-chan went to a Ruffian school this time!

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:37.686
Let's see!

00:31:46.328 --> 00:31:48.630
De-den!

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.091
What's this?

00:31:50.551 --> 00:31:51.772
A block party?

00:31:53.373 --> 00:31:56.196
It's so nice, so harmonious.

00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:59.578
Look at the skies, the trees are so lush.

00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:03.161
You know, it just looks like a wonderful day.

00:32:03.181 --> 00:32:05.383
Does a block party mean that there's ice cream?

00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:07.424
That's what Ruffians said.

00:32:07.444 --> 00:32:12.868
There's music, yummy food, ice cream, and even a bouncy castle.

00:32:14.463 --> 00:32:16.384
Did you go on a bouncy castle?

00:32:16.764 --> 00:32:18.504
I wanna go on a bouncy castle!

00:32:18.524 --> 00:32:22.666
Moco-chan, we have to be careful though, because... Aquas, you know?

00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:24.606
Okay, we won't pop anything.

00:32:24.626 --> 00:32:25.627
Yeah, no popping.

00:32:25.687 --> 00:32:26.387
Just bouncing.

00:32:26.447 --> 00:32:27.747
Just bouncing, you know?

00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:34.669
But we're really happy you had such a great time, and you were able to connect with your neighbors too, from the sounds of it.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:43.332
In case you didn't know, we get really shy, so we always try to avoid any neighbors in the Northwest Passage, but...

00:32:44.187 --> 00:32:45.188
You're stronger than us.

00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:46.048
Why?

00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:47.609
Brave.

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:54.232
But you know, we hope that you're able to get closer to everyone and maybe create an even stronger community together.

00:32:54.332 --> 00:32:58.494
You know, I've always thought that having a garden with all your neighbors would be nice.

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:06.078
Something with, like, flowers that you can just sit around in and just enjoy a good book in the middle of it so they're both hidden.

00:33:06.298 --> 00:33:11.081
I feel like we could get rid of the neighbors part and just, like, replace it with the Ruffians, though.

00:33:11.101 --> 00:33:13.002
That would be much, much, much better.

00:33:13.382 --> 00:33:15.347
Thank you very much!

00:33:15.387 --> 00:33:16.009
BAU BAU!

00:33:22.366 --> 00:33:24.247
Did any Ruffians have a question for us?

00:33:24.427 --> 00:33:25.787
I think so!

00:33:25.807 --> 00:33:29.029
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:30.669
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.950
Hello!

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.712
I just booked flights for a 26-day trip to Japan in mid-April!

00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:38.012
Wow!

00:33:38.032 --> 00:33:43.375
This will be my third time there, but I'm going with my parents for the first time!

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:44.195
Nice!

00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:44.895
Good memories!

00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:45.956
Wonderful!

00:33:46.136 --> 00:33:47.816
Can you recommend where we should go?

00:33:48.077 --> 00:33:49.877
Mister Donut is already on my list.

00:33:49.977 --> 00:33:50.938
Good, good, good!

00:33:52.543 --> 00:33:53.324
BAU BAU!

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:53.965
BAU BAU!

00:33:54.005 --> 00:33:54.606
Thank you!

00:33:54.626 --> 00:34:06.486
Well, you know, it's April, so obviously there's hanami, but it's kinda close to the end, so you might wanna go north to Hokkaido to try and be able to catch it, but even then, you know, hanami is more like a...

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.032
Now in March, right?

00:34:08.152 --> 00:34:09.213
Yeah, it's moving up a bit.

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:09.673
Right.

00:34:10.994 --> 00:34:14.356
But you know, there's only Shinjuku Gyoen you can go.

00:34:14.376 --> 00:34:19.300
You can get some obento and be able to enjoy the nature there.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.182
Very quiet even though it's in Shinjuku.

00:34:23.283 --> 00:34:25.905
There's also Sky-chi, like the Sora-machi.

00:34:25.945 --> 00:34:29.908
Sora-machi is the mall below Sky-chi.

00:34:30.008 --> 00:34:34.271
Sora-machi is really fun and Sky-chi is like the big tower.

00:34:35.692 --> 00:34:37.674
But I feel like we've never gone up to the top.

00:34:37.754 --> 00:34:38.475
It's kind of scary.

00:34:38.515 --> 00:34:46.182
If you're on a 26 day trip with your parents, then maybe you want some time just to do your own thing, and maybe they want some time to do their own thing.

00:34:46.462 --> 00:34:52.848
So Soramachi is good because there's so much stuff, so you can go look at whatever you want, and they can go look at whatever they want.

00:34:53.068 --> 00:34:56.551
There's lots of shopping to do there, but also only shopping you can do there, too.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.631
And then also, Sky Tree is pretty close to Asakusa.

00:35:02.971 --> 00:35:07.833
So you can start with Asakusa and then go to the Nakamise, the shopping street.

00:35:08.153 --> 00:35:10.374
There's a lot of different things you can get there.

00:35:10.754 --> 00:35:13.135
Fun things to eat, too.

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:15.916
Make sure you don't do tabeyaruki.

00:35:15.936 --> 00:35:17.117
Don't walk with the food.

00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:18.877
You have to stay at the place.

00:35:19.057 --> 00:35:21.298
And then you can go see Sensoji Temple, too.

00:35:21.438 --> 00:35:22.599
It's always awesome.

00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:24.900
And then after that, you can walk to Sky Tree.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.020
It's a little bit of a

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.923
It's a nice walk too.

00:35:29.223 --> 00:35:32.267
And of course you know Tokyo Tower.

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:37.313
Just because Tokyo Tower is not as big as Skytree doesn't mean that Tokyo Tower is not good.

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:43.540
The only thing that's sad about Soramachi is that there used to be a Mister Donut there and it's not anymore.

00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:46.343
It had a big bond of lions.

00:35:46.363 --> 00:35:48.165
It did!

00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:48.885
But no more.

00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:51.328
Tokyo Tower is really fun too.

00:35:52.169 --> 00:35:56.173
Probably if you're going with your parents, you probably want to not go to Akihabara.

00:35:56.474 --> 00:36:00.458
Just because they're probably not really interested in the Akihabara thing so much.

00:36:00.478 --> 00:36:01.419
Unless they are.

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:04.022
Unless they are, but that would be surprising.

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:07.783
Nakano Broadway is pretty cool.

00:36:08.023 --> 00:36:13.245
There's a lot of different subculture, pop culture anime and stuff too.

00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:15.585
You might find that kind of cool.

00:36:15.646 --> 00:36:18.066
Lots of different Manarake stores.

00:36:18.126 --> 00:36:19.387
Lots of things to look at.

00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:20.987
Right?

00:36:21.027 --> 00:36:25.508
It's a bit of a different kind of look into subcultures in Japan.

00:36:25.528 --> 00:36:26.989
There's some interesting ones, actually.

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:28.689
But we can just check out.

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:29.009
Right?

00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:30.090
Right!

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.710
Not Harajuku, I would say.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.971
Especially on weekends.

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.931
They're probably not too interested in that.

00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:38.852
I don't think your parents would be impressed with that.

00:36:39.452 --> 00:36:41.813
It's really busy at Harajuku, right?

00:36:41.953 --> 00:36:43.093
So... Yeah.

00:36:43.233 --> 00:36:43.494
Oh!

00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:45.354
Also, you could do, like, Ichinichi Taiken.

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:48.736
Like a one-day sort of experience sort of thing.

00:36:48.756 --> 00:36:51.116
Yeah, like a special class kind of thing, you know?

00:36:51.136 --> 00:36:53.357
Something that you could only do in Japan.

00:36:54.118 --> 00:36:57.619
There's lots of things like that, but if you just do Ichinichi Taiken.

00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:58.959
Yeah, you know?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.522
And then that way you can make really special memories all together, so... Only things that you can do then.

00:37:05.862 --> 00:37:07.784
We hope you have a really good time!

00:37:08.044 --> 00:37:10.547
Lots of time to do lots of fun stuff, right?

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:11.588
Good memories.

00:37:12.048 --> 00:37:14.991
I hope you have a really, really good time together.

00:37:16.514 --> 00:37:17.995
Thank you!

00:37:18.155 --> 00:37:20.797
Ruffians, don't forget, we're always looking for more submissions.

00:37:20.877 --> 00:37:24.059
You know, there's three FUWAMOCO Mornings a week.

00:37:24.259 --> 00:37:29.902
So, eventually, you know, your question might be answered.

00:37:29.922 --> 00:37:32.424
Your Doggie of the Day might be featured.

00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:33.725
You know, your walk.

00:37:34.205 --> 00:37:35.766
We want them!

00:37:35.826 --> 00:37:36.906
And questions, too!

00:37:37.327 --> 00:37:38.467
Questions, questions.

00:37:38.527 --> 00:37:40.088
I'm sure you have questions.

00:37:40.949 --> 00:37:43.170
We'll be waiting, okay, Ruffians?

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:43.751
BAU BAU!

00:37:45.852 --> 00:37:52.954
And our next stream, we have... That is Garlic Porn with Elfen.

00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:56.336
It's our first time playing Garlic Porn all together.

00:37:56.656 --> 00:37:58.857
Maybe there's some Ruffians that don't know what Garlic Porn is.

00:37:58.917 --> 00:38:00.057
It sounds a bit confusing.

00:38:00.097 --> 00:38:00.318
Right?

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.298
It's not Garlic, thank goodness.

00:38:02.598 --> 00:38:04.759
It's like a drawing game, like a telephone game.

00:38:04.959 --> 00:38:06.020
Yeah, a drawing.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.762
Maybe Moco-chan says natto.

00:38:09.162 --> 00:38:13.026
Or Nerissa eating natto.

00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:18.130
Yeah, so then Biboo has to draw what Nerissa eating natto looks like and then it kind of goes from there.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.432
And then you keep on guessing what the drawing is.

00:38:20.492 --> 00:38:21.673
It's really fun.

00:38:21.973 --> 00:38:29.960
But I'm a bit nervous because I don't want to be exposed to be the least skilled at drawing member of Abyss.

00:38:31.448 --> 00:38:33.289
But yeah, there's lots of different modes, right?

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.551
Do you think Ruffians will be okay?

00:38:36.571 --> 00:38:38.653
Will you be there to support me?

00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:41.714
If there's lots of different modes, you'll be okay at some point, right?

00:38:41.915 --> 00:38:42.175
Really?

00:38:42.415 --> 00:38:42.695
Yeah.

00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:44.356
Really?

00:38:46.237 --> 00:38:46.658
No.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:48.599
Humble?

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.420
I don't think I'm being humble.

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:56.440
As long as they're passionate, well, passionate is something we're both good at.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.242
I'll be there to join, so it'll be okay.

00:38:59.262 --> 00:39:07.068
Both Moco-chan and I will be both joining today, so please come and watch and join in on the silly times that will definitely be happening.

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:12.720
Let's take another look at our brand new schedule!

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.362
This week we have a lot of collabs and exciting things going on!

00:39:18.642 --> 00:39:24.544
I think Moco-chan and I both were really excited for the collabs with Calli-senpai and Fubuki-senpai!

00:39:26.084 --> 00:39:29.266
I'm very happy to be able to collab with some of our senpai.

00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:31.427
Of course we like Advent, but... Right?

00:39:31.447 --> 00:39:32.628
Are you sure?

00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:35.269
Yeah.

00:39:35.529 --> 00:39:39.351
We'll be playing Smash together with Calli-senpai on Wednesday.

00:39:39.612 --> 00:39:41.733
And that will be on her channel.

00:39:42.013 --> 00:39:43.434
Don't come here looking for it.

00:39:43.994 --> 00:39:48.917
But I think, you know, our goal is to make her growl, you know?

00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:52.283
We're going to kind of team up on her if we can, right?

00:39:52.463 --> 00:39:56.906
We want to show, you know, just how strong our bond as twins are.

00:39:57.206 --> 00:40:03.190
But I do think Calli-senpai probably has more experience than us, right?

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.311
We're going to do our best.

00:40:04.371 --> 00:40:04.731
Yeah.

00:40:05.271 --> 00:40:11.996
And next on Thursday after that, we're going to be visiting Fubuki-senpai's home again in the back.

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:14.437
Yeah, we already went once.

00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:17.098
You remember, right, Ruffians?

00:40:17.939 --> 00:40:30.004
Yeah, but we're happy though because you know, Fubuki-senpai's shown a lot of our senpai around before, so we're excited that she's willing to do that account for us, right?

00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:34.587
Don't think about the not good things.

00:40:34.647 --> 00:40:42.190
Hopefully we won't be scared this time, but... She'll be holding our hands, so it should be better, right?

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.811
Right?

00:40:43.831 --> 00:40:45.392
FUWAMOCO's holding our hands.

00:40:45.432 --> 00:40:47.352
We have to make sure they're not sweaty, right?

00:40:49.696 --> 00:40:50.316
Deep breaths.

00:40:50.456 --> 00:40:52.417
Lots of deep breaths beforehand.

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:56.558
But we hope that you join us, Ruffians!
