05:11.561 --> 05:13.742
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:14.322 --> 05:17.584
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.604 --> 05:21.365
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.465 --> 05:23.366
BAU BAU!

05:23.386 --> 05:27.248
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.689
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:30.969 --> 05:33.791
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:33.851 --> 05:34.431
BAU BAU!

05:35.442 --> 05:41.847
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning, Ruffians!

05:42.548 --> 05:45.470
It's our 80th episode today!

05:45.590 --> 05:46.691
And we still doing!

05:49.535 --> 05:51.037
80th episode at 8am!

05:51.057 --> 05:54.500
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:54.580 --> 05:55.781
Are we sure though?

05:56.442 --> 05:57.503
I'm pretty sure.

05:57.823 --> 05:57.903
Yes.

05:57.923 --> 05:58.263
80 already?

05:58.363 --> 05:59.244
I know, right?

05:59.264 --> 06:01.466
I mean, we do have enough.

06:06.937 --> 06:07.897
Christmas.

06:08.298 --> 06:11.719
We had the FUWAMOCO Morning specials, but... Specials!

06:11.959 --> 06:18.321
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 80th episode!

06:18.401 --> 06:20.262
BAU BAU!

06:20.342 --> 06:23.683
Hey, it's already the 80th episode!

06:23.743 --> 06:26.464
Somehow, we're here at 80 now!

06:28.245 --> 06:29.085
It's not our age.

06:29.465 --> 06:30.106
Not our age.

06:30.186 --> 06:31.586
No, we're much older than that.

06:31.626 --> 06:32.627
BAU BAU!

06:33.087 --> 06:35.928
Well, Ruffians,

06:37.028 --> 06:38.969
It's our 80th episode today, but... Oh!

06:39.029 --> 06:42.530
Hatsuriyatai!

06:42.610 --> 06:45.971
I'm gonna explain!

06:46.312 --> 06:52.694
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:52.794 --> 06:53.914
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:54.234 --> 06:55.795
And it's hosted by us.

06:56.455 --> 06:57.896
FUWAMOCO!

06:57.916 --> 07:03.679
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:03.719 --> 07:08.201
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag... What?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.802
That's not a hashtag.

07:11.343 --> 07:14.804
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:15.265 --> 07:19.347
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:19.947 --> 07:23.270
BAU BAU!

07:25.051 --> 07:25.812
Hashtag.

07:27.594 --> 07:28.314
Hashtag.

07:28.434 --> 07:29.095
Hashtag.

07:30.176 --> 07:32.258
What's the thing you hold stuff in, Moco-chan?

07:33.559 --> 07:34.460
Plastic bag.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.242
Plastic bag.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.243
Hashtag.

07:40.124 --> 07:40.785
Say it again?

07:41.846 --> 07:42.747
Plastic bag.

07:43.527 --> 07:44.168
Hashtag.

07:46.445 --> 07:46.685
Huh.

07:47.186 --> 07:47.746
BAU BAU!

07:47.826 --> 07:49.087
BAU BAU!

07:51.309 --> 07:52.230
Wow!

07:53.071 --> 07:55.373
Maybe not as good as a plastic bag.

07:56.294 --> 07:58.255
But it looks sort of similar.

07:59.457 --> 08:04.901
A Ruffian spotted Pero again.

08:06.343 --> 08:11.267
And Moco-chan, you think Pero is a... He looks kind of like a plastic bag.

08:11.527 --> 08:12.928
But the plastic bag's better?

08:15.242 --> 08:16.823
Can't hold stuff with Pero.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.585
Let's see where he was spotted!

08:21.805 --> 08:23.065
De-den!

08:29.668 --> 08:31.489
What does this mean, Moco-chan?

08:32.409 --> 08:34.110
Was he spotted nowhere?

08:34.730 --> 08:35.190
De-den!

08:36.391 --> 08:37.491
I feel...

08:44.562 --> 08:51.786
Just because you're here, a bit of a vision.

08:51.826 --> 08:53.327
What's going on here?

08:53.527 --> 08:58.951
When I look at Pero like that, I'm a bit concerned.

08:59.491 --> 09:00.652
The look in his eyes.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.295
Straight up, there's a Ruffian.

09:05.515 --> 09:07.996
Were you able to pick up the package?

09:09.317 --> 09:09.998
What was in it?

09:11.658 --> 09:16.060
Maybe our debut merch?

09:17.340 --> 09:18.781
That would be nice, you know?

09:19.821 --> 09:22.062
We hope you're able to get it with no problems.

09:24.002 --> 09:27.104
But, well... Moco-chan.

09:28.004 --> 09:29.284
That's the thing.

09:29.304 --> 09:38.248
Well, we were told that this Ruffian hasn't tweeted since they uploaded this photo.

09:39.108 --> 09:39.208
Oh.

09:41.124 --> 09:42.925
They might be in trouble.

09:43.305 --> 09:48.567
If you're doing okay, Ruffian, give us a sign!

09:48.827 --> 09:52.048
I didn't know that picking up packages could be this dangerous.

09:52.528 --> 09:54.369
Be careful, Ruffians, okay?

09:54.409 --> 09:55.869
You have to be on the lookout.

09:56.350 --> 09:56.770
Yeah.

09:57.270 --> 09:57.730
Okay.

09:59.251 --> 10:00.511
Safety's important.

10:00.991 --> 10:01.171
BAU BAU.

10:01.191 --> 10:01.311
Got it?

10:01.331 --> 10:01.811
BAU BAU.

10:01.831 --> 10:03.652
We want you to be safe.

10:04.552 --> 10:05.113
Got it?

10:05.173 --> 10:05.473
Yeah.

10:05.933 --> 10:08.354
As demon guards, we want you to be safe.

10:09.363 --> 10:11.085
BAU BAU!

10:12.286 --> 10:18.493
Well, Ruffians, we have some amazing news for you!

10:18.673 --> 10:21.336
Adventrix too!

10:21.456 --> 10:29.544
Because, well, Nerissa and Biboo, they're gonna be releasing their first cover song together!

10:30.425 --> 10:32.547
BAU BAU!

10:32.627 --> 10:40.795
It's gonna be on Nerissa's channel and it'll be premiering tomorrow on Tuesday at 5pm PT or 10am JST.

10:40.835 --> 10:43.238
We're so excited!

10:43.458 --> 10:47.922
We're gonna be singing the song "OTOMEROID"!

10:48.243 --> 10:49.564
It's cute, so shiny.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.054
You know what I really like?

10:53.074 --> 10:58.559
Both Nerissa and Biboo, they have very different voices and personalities.

11:20.277 --> 11:25.458
I think, you know, it really works so well because they're so different, you know?

11:25.478 --> 11:25.958
Right, right!

11:26.198 --> 11:30.379
Yeah, I really love that about Advent, right?

11:30.399 --> 11:35.520
We're all so different, but you know, we come together to make a very special unit!

11:35.980 --> 11:38.781
Please make sure to check it out, Ruffians!

11:38.861 --> 11:39.141
Okay!

11:39.421 --> 11:42.701
Only one more sleep until it premieres.

11:43.021 --> 11:43.661
Got it!

11:44.282 --> 11:45.922
BAU BAU!

11:46.782 --> 11:50.147
Ruffians, you know, this week is

12:02.142 --> 12:02.642
BAU!

12:02.702 --> 12:03.023
BAU!

12:03.083 --> 12:03.283
BAU!

12:17.310 --> 12:24.834
She's doing a pause for a cause charity scheme to raise money for cat protection in the UK!

12:24.914 --> 12:27.495
BAU BAU!

12:28.696 --> 12:34.939
And well, I think you know how much we love cats, right Ruffians?

12:36.975 --> 12:39.236
And, Calli-senpai does too!

12:39.537 --> 12:42.738
So she invited us to be a part of it!

12:42.778 --> 12:47.121
But you know, our demon dog paws will be put to good use!

12:47.381 --> 12:50.963
Paws for a coin!

12:51.003 --> 13:00.648
We'll be taking a look all together at some of your adorable pets with the hashtag, hashtag, FUWAMOCALLIEPETS.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.770
Not just dogs this time.

13:03.890 --> 13:04.590
Cats.

13:05.309 --> 13:06.750
It's safe in the cheeks.

13:06.790 --> 13:07.571
Just a little.

13:31.979 --> 13:40.181
But we're also going to be playing a Mario Party together with her and another lovely VTuber named Milky Queen!

13:40.261 --> 13:44.202
And it's the first time for all of us!

13:44.402 --> 13:49.803
We're really excited because Milky Queen was how we discovered VTubers first!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.324
We really love her!

13:53.004 --> 13:56.006
We're really looking forward to having such a silly time.

13:56.026 --> 13:58.267
A Mario Party!

13:58.287 --> 14:02.870
Kinda brings something different out in FUWAMOCO, right?

14:03.150 --> 14:08.893
We've been trying to get Advent to play with us, but... It hasn't happened.

14:11.135 --> 14:17.560
Please join us and Calli-senpai for a pause for our first charity stream tomorrow, okay?

14:18.501 --> 14:22.104
Let's all put all our paws towards a good cause.

14:22.245 --> 14:26.348
BAU BAU!

14:27.169 --> 14:27.769
It'll be cute.

14:29.091 --> 14:32.914
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's cute pets!

14:33.255 --> 14:33.715
Right!

14:33.855 --> 14:35.096
Especially the cats.

14:35.297 --> 14:38.279
Please, please send us your cats, okay?

14:38.700 --> 14:39.961
Physically, not just photos.

14:40.121 --> 14:40.462
Yeah.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.222
Physically.

14:42.584 --> 14:45.146
BAU BAU!

14:46.307 --> 14:50.631
Well, Ruffians, I wonder... Did you see this?

14:50.651 --> 14:53.154
They're cool, but...

14:53.823 --> 14:59.789
But Morning Senchou Senpai drew us an illustration!

14:59.970 --> 15:00.851
Just for us!

15:00.871 --> 15:02.412
Just for us, okay?

15:02.472 --> 15:07.057
She drew Moco-chan here by hand with a mechanical pencil.

15:07.177 --> 15:08.599
Isn't it adorable?

15:08.919 --> 15:10.060
Adorable, huh?

15:10.080 --> 15:10.201
Yeah.

15:12.663 --> 15:18.125
Ah, well, you know, Marine-senchou-senpai, she said that we're cute, too.

15:18.385 --> 15:23.567
But she said that she especially likes how Moco-chan, how you speak.

15:24.127 --> 15:26.929
I don't really know what she's talking about too much, though.

15:28.109 --> 15:31.530
I know the Ruffians said on my birthday that you like the way I speak, too.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.872
But... I don't know.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.212
I don't know.

15:36.232 --> 15:36.572
True.

15:36.892 --> 15:37.212
Agreed 100%.

15:37.292 --> 15:37.453
Huh?

15:37.513 --> 15:37.713
Huh?

15:41.744 --> 15:43.005
Like, BAU BAU!

15:43.025 --> 15:43.625
BAU BAU!

15:43.806 --> 15:44.987
Ore mo!

15:45.127 --> 15:45.807
Ore mo!

15:46.227 --> 15:47.548
Morning senchou!

15:47.669 --> 15:48.889
Morning senchou!

15:49.090 --> 15:49.590
Ahoy!

15:49.710 --> 15:50.471
Ahoy!

15:50.491 --> 15:53.393
That sounds weird.

15:53.613 --> 15:53.893
Ahoy!

15:54.834 --> 15:55.454
Ahoy!

15:55.675 --> 15:56.235
Ahoy!

15:56.395 --> 15:56.876
Ahoy!

15:57.156 --> 16:01.479
Sounds a little different.

16:01.719 --> 16:01.979
It does!

16:02.120 --> 16:04.201
It sounds a little different.

16:04.241 --> 16:06.163
Mococo!

16:06.243 --> 16:06.303
Huh?

16:09.034 --> 16:09.294
Hi!

16:09.835 --> 16:12.657
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

16:14.919 --> 16:15.540
I hear it.

16:15.740 --> 16:21.164
I hear it, Ruffians.

16:21.785 --> 16:27.189
Anyways, Marin-senchou-senpai's illustration is now up on our fridge.

16:27.690 --> 16:31.373
Our fridge is a very special spot, okay Ruffians?

16:31.633 --> 16:33.254
It's not just the fridge, okay?

16:33.274 --> 16:34.375
Because you know,

16:36.517 --> 16:38.818
The fridge is where all your food is.

16:39.018 --> 16:43.820
And whenever you need to have food, which is multiple times a day, you look at the fridge.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.841
It's a special, special spot.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.141
That's why it's special, because there's food in it!

16:48.822 --> 16:50.902
And because there's special things on the front, too.

16:53.402 --> 17:02.509
Well, we really love it that much, okay?

17:02.529 --> 17:03.169
BAU BAU!

17:04.150 --> 17:11.515
Alright, we got illustrations from Calli-senpai, Mikocchi-senpai, Marine-senchou-senpai.

17:11.595 --> 17:17.580
We're gonna have to start doing more drawings ourselves, but... But, well...

17:24.690 --> 17:25.730
Ruffians.

17:26.951 --> 17:28.312
Ruffians.

17:29.472 --> 17:34.254
We have a little bit of an apology to make.

17:36.775 --> 17:44.018
You know, yesterday we had a homework day, right?

17:44.679 --> 17:46.759
On our schedule it's a homework day.

17:46.779 --> 17:48.020
Yeah.

17:50.990 --> 17:55.032
And you know, we said we're going to work really, really hard, right?

17:55.052 --> 17:56.733
Get our homework done.

17:56.753 --> 18:01.916
Yeah.

18:02.016 --> 18:06.939
Well, actually... That's not what happened at all!

18:07.839 --> 18:10.521
We're so, so, so Ruffians!

18:12.887 --> 18:21.710
There were alarms, and by the time we woke up, it was already way dark out.

18:21.990 --> 18:23.451
Really, really dark.

18:23.851 --> 18:24.731
Yeah.

18:24.991 --> 18:29.953
You know, we even would have slept through our regular meeting time with Mine-chan!

18:30.553 --> 18:33.494
But, luckily it was cancelled yesterday.

18:33.554 --> 18:34.495
Yeah.

18:35.035 --> 18:35.255
So...

18:37.093 --> 18:40.435
We didn't get as much homework done as we had planned.

18:40.675 --> 18:43.416
Yeah.

18:43.816 --> 18:46.398
But, but, we did get a lot of rest.

18:47.038 --> 18:47.418
Yeah.

18:48.058 --> 18:49.979
Which is really important too, right?

18:50.680 --> 18:50.980
Yeah.

18:52.159 --> 18:56.282
It's kind of an important part of our duty as Demon Guide Dogs, too, right?

18:56.342 --> 18:58.383
You too, Ruffians.

18:58.743 --> 18:59.103
Right?

18:59.144 --> 19:01.265
That's why I always say right, okay?

19:01.725 --> 19:04.567
So make sure you rest when you need to rest, okay?

19:05.027 --> 19:09.230
But, uh... Now we have to run, run, run, okay?

19:09.250 --> 19:11.291
And, you know, uh... Well, uh...

19:22.020 --> 19:24.061
And yes, our sleepiness.

19:25.101 --> 19:26.881
Our soupy brain-ness.

19:28.362 --> 19:30.762
It also caused something else to happen.

19:31.082 --> 19:31.643
Yeah.

19:32.843 --> 19:33.883
Ruffians.

19:35.444 --> 19:51.048
I don't know how many hours we slept, but because of it, well, there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

19:58.660 --> 20:04.884
Somehow, somewhere, many times over, we misunderstood the time that we would be collabing with Koe-senpai.

20:21.271 --> 20:24.193
You know, we even go from the date and time with her.

20:24.614 --> 20:28.657
You know, somehow we just really got confused with time zones.

20:29.077 --> 20:30.258
You know, we're used to it.

20:30.419 --> 20:33.341
We've been doing this forever with no issues.

20:34.602 --> 20:36.203
Why now all of a sudden?

20:36.544 --> 20:37.885
Must be the spring.

20:38.665 --> 20:39.066
Yeah.

20:41.280 --> 20:46.805
Anyways, we now have five different things on Valentine's Day.

20:47.926 --> 20:51.349
This is our updated schedule.

20:51.830 --> 20:56.854
We have a karaoke stream together with Kawaii Senpai first thing in the morning at 6am.

20:59.221 --> 21:00.842
A little early FUWAMOCO Morning.

21:01.402 --> 21:07.186
And then a collab cover song releases at 7AM on Kuro-senpai's channel.

21:07.727 --> 21:12.730
And then over on our channel, well, it's FUWAMOCO Morning at 8AM.

21:13.330 --> 21:19.694
Then, a super special choose-your-own-adventure Valentine's Day stream at 6PM.

21:20.335 --> 21:25.158
And finally, our members-only version Valentine's Day stream.

21:27.251 --> 21:27.772
Yeah.

21:29.072 --> 21:30.753
It's just a bit busy.

21:31.113 --> 21:31.934
Just a bit.

21:32.554 --> 21:44.600
Yeah, but between all the prep for the Valentine's Day stream and all our plans, I don't really know when we'll be sleeping, but we know one thing, Ruffians!

21:44.920 --> 21:50.623
We're going to have an amazing Valentine's Day together with all of you!

21:52.304 --> 21:58.648
Please join us and let's have the best Valentine's Day all together, okay?

21:59.109 --> 21:59.769
Midnight now.

22:02.351 --> 22:05.513
BAU BAU!

22:05.613 --> 22:09.896
You have to be there for the Valentine's Day stream, okay?

22:10.076 --> 22:11.657
You have to.

22:12.958 --> 22:13.398
BAU BAU!

22:17.817 --> 22:18.617
Wow!

22:19.338 --> 22:22.001
Moco-chan, do you know what day of the week it is?

22:23.142 --> 22:25.143
No, I can't remember anymore.

22:26.084 --> 22:26.985
Ruffians!

22:27.005 --> 22:28.567
Do you know what day of the week it is?

22:29.207 --> 22:36.875
It's Monday, the first day of the week, which means Moco-chan is gonna challenge herself to something new?

22:38.756 --> 22:39.477
New question mark.

22:40.477 --> 22:45.580
Which is... Overcoming her dislike of natto!

22:45.840 --> 22:53.204
It's now been very many weeks now.

22:53.720 --> 22:53.980
BAU BAU!

22:54.000 --> 22:54.180
BAU BAU!

22:54.200 --> 22:54.420
BAU BAU!

22:54.440 --> 22:54.641
BAU BAU!

22:54.681 --> 22:54.961
BAU BAU!

22:55.001 --> 22:55.361
BAU BAU!

22:55.401 --> 22:55.701
BAU BAU!

23:10.490 --> 23:12.550
It's really good for you, good for your tummy.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.511
Vitamins you can only get from natto.

23:15.771 --> 23:22.552
Which, you know, it's interesting, Moco-chan, because sometimes we hear that from Ruffians that there's a vitamin that you can only get from FUWAMOCO.

23:22.592 --> 23:25.973
If you think about it, we're like the Ruffians, natto, then, huh?

23:27.433 --> 23:28.573
So... Ruffians!

23:29.333 --> 23:30.874
And we are natto-ers!

23:31.894 --> 23:35.795
So then, Moco-chan, today you have to be a bit of a cannibal.

23:36.195 --> 23:36.455
What?

23:36.515 --> 23:37.755
And eat the...

23:38.536 --> 23:40.497
The bean version of FUWAMOCO.

23:43.078 --> 23:43.758
Got it!

23:44.458 --> 23:45.999
Understood?

23:46.079 --> 23:46.599
Yeah.

23:47.739 --> 23:48.120
Yeah.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.380
Moco-chan!

23:49.760 --> 23:54.482
It's all ready!

23:55.382 --> 23:59.624
Why are you making ghost sounds like that?

23:59.684 --> 24:02.445
Last time, Moco-chan, you ate two beans, right?

24:02.645 --> 24:03.465
I did!

24:03.525 --> 24:03.845
Yeah!

24:03.905 --> 24:07.407
But I don't have any stuff for this!

24:07.807 --> 24:08.087
Stuff?

24:09.574 --> 24:10.955
Sesame oil.

24:10.995 --> 24:16.138
Well, I said no to the sesame oil today because I want Moco-chan to improve, Ruffians.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.400
But I did say yes to soy sauce.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.321
I don't want soy sauce!

24:20.821 --> 24:22.162
I want soy sauce later.

24:22.222 --> 24:25.524
I don't want sesame oil.

24:27.285 --> 24:28.967
Moco-chan, do you want the soy sauce?

24:29.007 --> 24:29.787
No crutches!

24:30.868 --> 24:31.488
Crunches?

24:31.668 --> 24:32.769
No, no crutches.

24:36.151 --> 24:36.852
Soy sauce, no?

24:38.137 --> 24:39.178
Ruffians, look at the design!

24:39.198 --> 24:42.180
Wait, I'm gonna pick up a bean and put a drop on the bean.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.261
You have to make sure you aim proper.

24:45.281 --> 24:46.042
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

24:46.082 --> 24:47.103
I haven't picked it up!

24:51.285 --> 24:52.706
Let me choose the bean!

24:52.726 --> 24:55.748
Choose faster!

24:55.968 --> 24:57.029
It's stringy!

24:57.049 --> 25:03.353
Okay, one second, one second!

25:03.693 --> 25:04.573
Okay, okay, okay.

25:05.174 --> 25:06.214
Drop of soy sauce.

25:06.354 --> 25:07.275
Just a drop, just a drop.

25:13.534 --> 25:16.455
Guess that was your best attempt, huh?

25:16.475 --> 25:20.577
I see you on there.

25:20.837 --> 25:22.938
Here we go!

25:22.958 --> 25:25.159
Here we go!

25:26.900 --> 25:28.280
Okay, Moco-chan, you can do it!

25:28.340 --> 25:32.182
No countdown this time!

25:32.202 --> 25:32.182
3, 2, 2!

25:33.162 --> 25:40.665
You can do it, Moco-chan!

25:40.725 --> 25:42.086
Don't make that face!

25:43.476 --> 25:44.057
You got it!

25:44.077 --> 25:45.378
You got it!

25:46.019 --> 25:47.121
Oh, she's chewing it!

25:47.141 --> 25:48.402
Yum, yum, yum!

25:48.462 --> 25:49.984
You did it!

25:50.044 --> 25:52.487
You did it, Moco-chan!

25:52.788 --> 25:54.349
I just tasted soy sauce.

25:55.311 --> 25:56.853
Okay, let's do a second one then.

25:59.071 --> 26:00.171
It tastes different.

26:00.852 --> 26:04.533
But I feel like last time when we put soy sauce on it, it was worse.

26:05.093 --> 26:06.554
Much, much worse.

26:07.214 --> 26:07.774
No!

26:08.154 --> 26:14.097
And to be honest, I totally saw the soy sauce completely miss the bean and just get on the chopsticks.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.538
What does it taste like?

26:18.158 --> 26:19.779
It maybe tastes like natto?

26:19.879 --> 26:20.379
No.

26:23.040 --> 26:23.500
Okay.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.581
We're gonna do a second bean!

26:26.909 --> 26:28.231
Let's see if it's any better.

26:29.692 --> 26:32.156
Could you be getting used to the taste, Moco-chan?

26:33.497 --> 26:34.418
You chewed it!

26:34.478 --> 26:35.780
There's no way you didn't taste it.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.541
Okay, go!

26:36.561 --> 26:36.741
Go!

26:37.282 --> 26:37.883
It's in there!

26:38.083 --> 26:38.523
It's in!

26:39.465 --> 26:39.585
Oh!

26:42.388 --> 26:43.450
Oh, you're chewing it!

26:44.030 --> 26:45.132
Can you do a third?

26:46.765 --> 26:49.166
Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

26:49.627 --> 26:51.207
It's today's the day!

26:51.828 --> 26:54.029
Okay Moco-chan, third bean, let's do it!

26:54.049 --> 26:55.490
Are you gonna take two?

26:55.510 --> 26:56.690
Two beans at once?

26:56.730 --> 26:57.831
They're stuck together.

26:57.851 --> 26:59.311
You can do it, you can do it.

26:59.972 --> 27:00.632
Four beans.

27:01.292 --> 27:02.333
Four beans today!

27:02.633 --> 27:02.893
No.

27:03.354 --> 27:04.714
Keep going, keep going!

27:04.734 --> 27:05.635
Let's do three.

27:05.675 --> 27:07.255
This is a big one though, okay?

27:07.315 --> 27:08.036
It's a big one.

27:08.914 --> 27:09.514
Okay, I did it.

27:09.775 --> 27:10.595
Three beans.

27:11.316 --> 27:12.236
A little soy sauce.

27:12.356 --> 27:13.117
Oh, oh, I missed.

27:13.137 --> 27:13.697
I missed it.

27:13.857 --> 27:14.298
There we go.

27:14.358 --> 27:14.738
There we go.

27:14.958 --> 27:15.839
Is that enough for that?

27:15.879 --> 27:16.279
That's good.

27:16.439 --> 27:17.120
That's good.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.182
Beautifully covered in a blanket of soy sauce.

27:20.282 --> 27:21.302
I don't know about that.

27:21.342 --> 27:23.324
I have the natto from Tochigiza.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.004
Okay, okay.

27:24.164 --> 27:24.865
It's very enjoyable.

27:24.885 --> 27:25.485
Countdown!

27:25.505 --> 27:26.446
Three!

27:26.466 --> 27:27.647
Two!

27:28.347 --> 27:28.547
One!

27:29.768 --> 27:30.749
Okay, okay.

27:31.269 --> 27:32.430
Some strings, but it's okay.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.230
Moco-chan's a pro.

27:33.330 --> 27:36.913
Oh, except for the face is getting a bit more intense this time.

27:39.038 --> 27:39.959
Okay, Moco-chan!

27:40.199 --> 27:40.819
Another bean!

27:40.879 --> 27:41.680
Another bean!

27:41.700 --> 27:42.880
Another!

27:43.140 --> 27:44.281
Another!

27:44.381 --> 27:45.161
Yeah!

27:45.462 --> 27:49.603
Another bean!

27:50.004 --> 27:51.464
I can see it on your face.

27:51.524 --> 27:54.426
You still have so much room to go.

27:55.786 --> 27:56.467
I can see it.

27:57.247 --> 28:01.329
I know all the faces Moco-chan makes when she eats natto.

28:01.969 --> 28:05.491
And she has so much more natto she can eat today.

28:05.991 --> 28:07.492
You're just pouring it all over.

28:08.915 --> 28:09.635
Fourth bean!

28:09.735 --> 28:10.315
Here we go!

28:11.756 --> 28:14.517
This one has quite a good blanket of soy sauce on it.

28:18.998 --> 28:19.458
It's gone.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.299
Oh my goodness!

28:23.579 --> 28:24.960
It tastes different to me.

28:24.980 --> 28:25.900
Four beans!

28:26.200 --> 28:28.961
It tastes... It tastes very sweet.

28:29.081 --> 28:31.221
Akemoco-chan, you're gonna go for your fifth bean.

28:31.642 --> 28:33.122
No soy sauce!

28:33.142 --> 28:34.302
Yeah!

28:35.963 --> 28:36.683
No soy sauce.

28:38.809 --> 28:40.010
No soy sauce for you.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.472
My gosh, this is a miracle, Ruffians!

28:43.613 --> 28:47.296
It's a Valentine's Day miracle!

28:48.537 --> 28:49.658
Oh my gosh!

28:49.958 --> 28:52.520
I didn't eat the natto just for you, okay?

28:52.700 --> 28:55.362
Moco-chan is becoming unstoppable!

28:55.382 --> 28:56.743
Natto machine!

28:56.764 --> 28:58.205
Okay, Moco-chan!

28:58.885 --> 28:59.446
Go!

28:59.546 --> 29:00.707
No soy sauce!

29:01.207 --> 29:03.589
A raw, straight natto bean.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.012
She chewed it!

29:09.899 --> 29:11.141
Oh my gosh!

29:11.381 --> 29:12.743
Ruffians!

29:14.586 --> 29:18.491
Are you just... What's the situation here, Moco-chan?

29:18.551 --> 29:20.334
Are you just... I don't know.

29:21.515 --> 29:21.735
Wow.

29:22.731 --> 29:23.691
I don't know what to say.

29:23.711 --> 29:26.612
Okay, I need to test you.

29:27.092 --> 29:29.072
You need to take up at least three at once.

29:29.092 --> 29:30.113
Three at once?

29:30.413 --> 29:31.813
And then this could be over.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.594
I don't even know how many beans I'm eating then.

29:34.634 --> 29:36.434
That's five beans you've eaten.

29:36.954 --> 29:37.354
Five?

29:37.614 --> 29:38.615
Yeah, that's five.

29:38.895 --> 29:40.055
Today you have five!

29:40.635 --> 29:41.835
You have five today!

29:41.855 --> 29:45.216
Three at once, we're gonna do it.

29:46.096 --> 29:46.576
Three at once?

29:46.676 --> 29:47.156
Yeah.

29:47.697 --> 29:49.237
And then you can finish your meal.

29:52.108 --> 29:53.888
Oh my gosh.

29:54.488 --> 29:58.929
There's more sticky stuff between them when there's many of those.

29:58.969 --> 29:59.169
Yeah.

29:59.209 --> 30:00.050
That's the good part.

30:00.730 --> 30:01.670
You have two beans!

30:01.810 --> 30:02.230
One more!

30:02.970 --> 30:03.130
One more!

30:03.150 --> 30:04.951
I don't think I can pick up three at once.

30:05.351 --> 30:10.712
Do you want your record to be... Eight beans?

30:10.932 --> 30:12.352
Or do you want it to be seven beans?

30:13.112 --> 30:14.713
I think eight is a better number.

30:16.473 --> 30:16.953
I don't know.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.492
8 bins to infinity!

30:21.752 --> 30:22.172
Right!

30:22.192 --> 30:23.872
8 bins on 80.

30:24.032 --> 30:24.592
Right.

30:26.053 --> 30:30.233
That makes sense, but I feel like 3 at once is really pushing it, Ruffians!

30:30.533 --> 30:31.274
You can do it!

30:31.294 --> 30:33.374
Do you want a bit of soy sauce for this one?

30:33.694 --> 30:33.954
Yeah.

30:36.415 --> 30:37.295
There you go.

30:37.315 --> 30:39.035
Just a little bit of a blanket.

30:39.155 --> 30:41.036
Okay, this is 3 at once now!

30:41.056 --> 30:41.676
Okay!

30:41.696 --> 30:42.036
Okay!

30:42.056 --> 30:42.036
3!

30:42.076 --> 30:42.036
2!

30:42.096 --> 30:44.136
1!

30:42.576 --> 30:44.136
Okay, okay.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.964
You did it, Moco-chan!

30:53.064 --> 30:56.629
I did it!

30:56.949 --> 30:59.593
Let me see.

31:00.434 --> 31:00.834
I did it!

31:06.682 --> 31:07.463
I did it!

31:07.643 --> 31:10.405
I'm so proud of you, FUWAMOCO-chan!

31:10.866 --> 31:13.207
BAU BAU!

31:13.328 --> 31:14.629
I did it, okay?

31:15.129 --> 31:18.011
I ate eight beers!

31:18.131 --> 31:20.453
What was my previous record?

31:20.794 --> 31:20.954
Three.

31:22.390 --> 31:22.691
BAU BAU!

31:22.711 --> 31:23.591
Okay, Moco-chan!

31:23.611 --> 31:24.332
I feel confused.

31:24.352 --> 31:27.736
Yeah, that's almost a whole spoonful!

31:43.212 --> 31:44.513
Wow.

31:44.953 --> 31:47.275
You can eat natto?

31:47.475 --> 31:47.715
No.

31:47.935 --> 31:49.556
You can't?

31:49.576 --> 31:49.616
No!

31:49.796 --> 31:50.337
Wow.

31:50.737 --> 31:51.657
Ruffians!

31:52.218 --> 31:56.541
Remember, it's the start of a new week, so you can challenge it!

31:56.581 --> 31:57.841
You can do the thing!

31:58.142 --> 32:01.464
Moco-chan, she almost ate eight beans!

32:01.584 --> 32:04.306
That's like a sixteenth of the pack.

32:04.586 --> 32:05.406
That's pretty good.

32:07.153 --> 32:10.234
BAU BAU!

32:10.294 --> 32:13.334
Good job, Moco-chan!

32:13.434 --> 32:14.374
BAU BAU!

32:14.394 --> 32:20.176
I thank you farmers in Tochigi for making delicious natto.

32:20.196 --> 32:21.676
BAU BAU!

32:22.216 --> 32:26.017
This week, you know, is Cali-senpai's paws for the cause charity.

32:26.377 --> 32:30.217
But let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day.

32:30.758 --> 32:32.318
Doggie of the Day is...

32:33.929 --> 32:34.910
De-den!

32:34.970 --> 32:36.392
BAU BAU!

32:47.230 --> 32:48.410
Big, big eyes.

32:48.710 --> 32:50.131
I love you!

32:50.771 --> 32:51.511
So cute!

32:51.591 --> 32:52.352
Very cute!

32:52.432 --> 32:53.832
Nose too!

32:53.892 --> 32:55.893
Big booba boy!

32:56.293 --> 32:58.554
Well, Kota's a very good boy.

32:58.574 --> 33:02.735
He loves to play and cuddle and sleep.

33:03.255 --> 33:04.695
All good things, huh?

33:04.796 --> 33:07.336
How does Kota BAU BAU?

33:10.760 --> 33:11.060
BAU BAU!

33:11.080 --> 33:11.441
BAU BAU!

33:11.461 --> 33:11.841
BAU BAU!

33:37.983 --> 33:41.445
You can see all the sweetness behind those puppy dog eyes.

33:41.625 --> 33:44.406
But Ruffians, do you notice something?

33:46.167 --> 33:46.567
Yeah.

33:46.927 --> 33:47.568
You see that there?

33:47.608 --> 33:48.028
We noticed.

33:48.348 --> 33:49.008
Cora!

33:49.388 --> 33:52.909
Cora has the pick of any shoe to chew on there.

33:52.929 --> 33:53.950
A lot of shoes!

33:54.350 --> 33:54.690
Yeah.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.351
And not a single one has been bitten.

33:57.611 --> 33:58.711
Not a single one!

33:58.792 --> 33:59.132
Right?

33:59.552 --> 34:01.713
What a good doggy!

34:01.833 --> 34:03.573
You are, Cora!

34:03.673 --> 34:05.354
BAU BAU!

34:05.394 --> 34:07.294
Good self-control.

34:07.355 --> 34:08.115
Not one!

34:08.395 --> 34:09.575
BAU BAU!

34:11.796 --> 34:17.182
And next for our today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

34:18.003 --> 34:22.468
It's a beautiful day!

34:23.409 --> 34:30.577
It really makes you want to go like dance and sing and be swirly about in the shining green field.

34:30.878 --> 34:31.959
Did you do that?

34:32.059 --> 34:32.840
I feel like

34:33.462 --> 34:36.464
You know, it would make sense if there was a fuzzy cow or two.

34:37.265 --> 34:41.428
And I could jump on the cow, see what happens.

34:41.448 --> 34:42.509
Yeah!

34:42.569 --> 34:47.633
But, you know, this kind of beautiful day really makes me so excited for spring!

34:47.753 --> 34:48.234
Right!

34:48.254 --> 34:50.676
Just around the corner, how rough it is!

34:50.856 --> 34:55.079
Think of all those wonderful walks waiting for us then, huh?

34:55.780 --> 34:56.661
I can't wait!

34:57.021 --> 34:57.882
BAU BAU!

35:01.384 --> 35:06.965
Oh, and next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

35:07.226 --> 35:07.346
Oh!

35:07.366 --> 35:10.706
Hi, Fuwawa-chan, uh, Mococo-chan!

35:10.786 --> 35:11.447
Hello!

35:11.527 --> 35:13.227
I have a question for Moco-chan.

35:13.507 --> 35:17.688
You said you really like succulents, and you have some plants already.

35:17.828 --> 35:22.229
Is there an occasion why you started to care for them, and what is your favorite kind?

35:22.529 --> 35:25.410
Your morning programs always make my day!

35:25.510 --> 35:27.190
BAU BAU!

35:27.210 --> 35:29.171
Wow, wow, Moco-chan.

35:30.307 --> 35:34.189
Originally, I saw succulents online.

35:35.389 --> 35:38.390
And, I don't know, I wanted to care for something.

35:39.951 --> 35:42.572
I guess, I guess I felt a bit lonely.

35:42.592 --> 35:44.472
I wanted some friends.

35:45.153 --> 35:47.294
I know they don't die easily!

35:48.254 --> 35:49.814
They won't leave you alone!

35:50.555 --> 35:50.975
And I...

35:52.079 --> 35:52.559
I don't know.

35:52.659 --> 35:53.980
They look really fun.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.082
There's a lot of different types.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.382
I know.

35:58.883 --> 36:03.125
They're very resilient, but also kind of particular about stuff.

36:04.326 --> 36:05.326
Kind of like me.

36:05.406 --> 36:07.688
And, I don't know.

36:08.108 --> 36:09.689
I like taking care of them.

36:10.129 --> 36:12.770
Although mine are very, very thirsty right now.

36:14.111 --> 36:15.332
But they aren't dead!

36:16.072 --> 36:17.413
Are they being taken care of?

36:17.513 --> 36:19.014
They are being taken care of.

36:19.594 --> 36:26.621
I wish I could get more light because the more light that some of them have then they turn

36:37.370 --> 36:38.131
FUWAMOCO Morning!

36:59.694 --> 37:00.195
BAU BAU!

37:09.949 --> 37:13.453
We have another theme coming up today.

37:13.473 --> 37:15.276
What theme is that, Moco-chan?

37:15.636 --> 37:18.600
We have White Album!

37:18.660 --> 37:20.222
De-den!

37:20.402 --> 37:23.706
We're playing White Album.

37:24.086 --> 37:29.012
If you haven't heard of it before, it's a visual novel that we really, really like.

37:29.853 --> 37:31.175
FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:45.373 --> 37:47.754
Things get dramatic.

37:47.794 --> 38:04.560
You know and well especially with her famous senpai also an idol she took us out on a date and then we saw we might have seen Yuki and her producer also out for a date business meeting date and then you know Yuki's manager trying to start a

38:05.709 --> 38:06.209
BAU BAU!

38:34.127 --> 38:38.289
And for our schedule, well, as you know, we messed up.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.389
We messed up!

38:39.730 --> 38:43.971
So please make sure that you take a good look at the updated version of our schedule.

38:43.991 --> 38:47.293
You can also find it on the YouTube community page and Twitter.

38:48.453 --> 38:55.156
And yes, let's have a lot of fun while surviving an extra special Valentine's Day together.

38:55.516 --> 39:00.438
Make sure, you know, our special Valentine's Day stream makes sure you're there.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.959
You have to be there, okay?
