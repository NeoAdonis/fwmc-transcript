Mococo reveals the real reason why her mouth is shaped like a cat, and it's of course so she can fit small kittens heads easily! Although in reality, it seems that this was just a joke. *Unless...*

[bardiche](https://twitter.com/katxts/status/1718664352444698747) visited the famous Castle Bran, a.k.a. Dracula's Castle. This Ruffian shared some photos of the event that was hosted there last weekend.

## ❓ Question of the Night ([29:38](https://youtu.be/f6Xtez79CNs?t=29m38s))

[Blazecake](https://twitter.com/Blazecake20/status/1706887023783563752) asks if there are types of "BAU BAU" other than "BAU BAU⤴︎⤴︎" and "bau bau⤵︎⤵︎". It seems that there are other types to convey other feelings! However, these might be also harder to understand for humans.
