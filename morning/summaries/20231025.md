## üÜï New Emotes ([12:30](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=12m30s))

Just before last Halloween Rock 'n Rawr Party, FUWAMOCO released new emotes for the Doggy Pack (channel members) to use in chat!

## üéûÔ∏è Petition ([15:10](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=15m10s))

Even though the new set of emotes includes one for Mococo sneezing, it's missing their Fuwawa counterpart. [A petition](https://chng.it/nfHHJLxdvT) was created already asking for equal representation of sneezes for both sisters.

## üëª Spooky Storytime ([18:20](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=18m20s))

FUWAMOCO will be hosting a story time stream where they'll be reading some of the spooky and silly stories written by Ruffians! You can submit yours [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNJFVNgkNxwKGcYppQx05s53oPWd8dP-BnIad3kcL37fS9hA/viewform)! Deadline: 2023-10-30T17:00Z

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([21:51](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=21m51s))

At some point during their [Phasmophobia collab with Fubuki and Polka](https://youtu.be/q6z1In_WUqI), Mococo says "Fuwawa wa Onee-chan dakara ne" ("that's because Fuwawa is my older sister, right"). Some Ruffians just caught the "Fuwawa Onee-chan" part and think that Mococo addressed her sister in a cutesy way, something that Moco-chan fiercely denies.

## üì£ Mococo Pup Talk ([25:50](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=25m50s))

From the other side (of the screen) comes spooky Moco-chan, encouraging you to be brave in order to survive any jump scare you might face this Halloween!

## üê∂ Doggie of the Day ([29:14](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=29m14s))

[chumbeque](https://twitter.com/chumbeque_3/status/1716538766574190864) shared a photo of Canela cosplaying. She's no longer with us but you can see that she was a good girl with a great sense of fashion.

## üö∂ Today I Went On A Walk ([31:17](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=31m17s))

[Joel Hein](https://twitter.com/OtakuJoe1/status/1702083880625557583) shares some pictures of their walk back home after work.

## ‚ùì Question Of The Day ([32:20](https://youtu.be/NRnMHn7bBHI?t=32m20s))

[Sobbi](https://twitter.com/Sobbi11/status/1706205209586790554) asks what would FUWAMOCO do if one day they switched bodies? The twins think at first that things wouldn't probably change at all, but they also express that they would feel uncomfortable and would like to swap places back ASAP. On the other hand, Ruffians have at least a pair of reasons to think that Mococo would feel stiffness on her new shoulders if that scenario were to happen...
