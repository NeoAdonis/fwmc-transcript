## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (06:39)

[Sky](https://twitter.com/Skylanderspizza/status/1703504111600115713) found Pero while mowing the lawn, but he noticed that the white blob was just in front of the mower a bit too late... Only a pair of broken bones seemed to remain... FUWAMOCO laughs at what they think is a Halloween joke. *But is it?*

## Confession (08:52)

Thanks to a certain puzzle level, FUWAMOCO spent 6 and a half hours [completing "Adventures of Cookies & Cream"](https://youtu.be/ZK7hNUALkvI), way more time than they expected. Unfortunately for them, they still had some homework to do, meaning that they've got no sleep that night. This has been a pattern during the last three weeks where they've got about 4 hours of sleep a day, so they ask Ruffians to lend them some power to go through the day.

## Bad News (13:54)

### Tongue accident (13:54)

Fuwawa bit her tongue during a few of her last recording sessions.

### Lights out (16:07)

Another lightbulb broke on a crucial area of the FUWAMOCO den. They somehow hope it fixes itself.

## Misunderstanding (17:44)

FUWAMOCO are concerned with some misleading clips that they've seen about them. They specifically reference one where Fuwawa presumably said that she liked to wear no clothes at all, something which is not true. The twin sisters ask clippers respectfully not to mislead others as to avoid creating any kind of misunderstandings.

## Grumpy FUWAMOCO (21:47)

FUWAMOCO share one thing that makes them grumpy: cutting in line. Usually they are considerate when people ask politely to go in front of them, but otherwise the guard dogs urge people not to just cut the line, even if they do so inadvertently.

## Mococo Pup Talk (24:33)

Mococo seems to have noticed that Ruffians might have been working hard, so she decided to give another of her now-famous pep talks to help them power through the rest of the week!

## Doggie of the Day (27:05)

[Sean Overton](https://twitter.com/FangorrLoL/status/1709607950698889295) shares a pic of chunky boy Reggie taking a nap.

## Today I Went On A Walk (28:46)

[Globits](https://twitter.com/Globitstg/status/1711653093488619625) finds a huge dragonfly while taking a walk through a local wetlands reserve.

## Question Of The Day (30:34)

[@platanostupido](https://twitter.com/platanostupido/status/1708833832580042988) asks FUWAMOCO which stream was the most challenging to prepare for (other than debut), as well as their most rewarding one. The sisters share that FWMC Morning demands lots of work in the background, and they usually wake up 3 hours before the actual stream to make the final arrangements. However, they are happy to do this kind of show if it helps Ruffians to start the day on the right paw.
