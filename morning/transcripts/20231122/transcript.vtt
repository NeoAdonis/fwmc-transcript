00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:24.618
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:28.781
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.503
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:34.705
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:38.307
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:38.908 --> 00:05:40.729
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.752
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:46.295
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:50.920
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.026
Ruffians, thank you for waking up and for joining us

00:05:56.526 --> 00:05:57.527
47 episodes!

00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:07.152
With every episode, I feel like I just start yelling it louder and higher pitch.

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:11.334
Eventually, it's just gonna be... Eventually we'll thank you for joining us for...

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:14.476
Like that.

00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:19.019
Well, we don't just make funny sounds, Ruffians.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.599
No!

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.602
Especially Ruffians joining us for the first time today, we should probably explain ourselves.

00:06:23.622 --> 00:06:24.523
Probably explain.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:31.407
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:31.927
A.k.a.

00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:32.908
FUWAMOCO-e!

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:36.010
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO-e!

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.133
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:45.194
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:47.615
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:52.097
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:52.117 --> 00:06:55.058
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:59.300
Did you get sleep?

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:01.521
Well rested, Ruffians?

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.943
Ready to bark with a new day?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.344
Did we have maybe a Pero Sighting?

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:19.887
Well, you know, Pero, there was a video.

00:07:20.787 --> 00:07:24.309
And, well, Ruffians, did you see Pero by any chance?

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:25.109
Let's see.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.631
We have... De-den!

00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:31.508
It's Pero!

00:07:31.548 --> 00:07:33.370
You found him, Ruffian!

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.812
Maybe he's in better spirits after his vacation.

00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:36.692
Maybe.

00:07:37.693 --> 00:07:42.357
It looks like this Ruffian found him checking out the Miss Universe pageant.

00:07:43.217 --> 00:07:44.418
Was he looking to enter it?

00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:49.582
I see.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:49.702
Pero.

00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:55.587
You're not just there to look at the cute girls, right, Pero?

00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:56.728
Right!

00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:01.296
Maybe that's what he liked doing his vacation.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.277
Cute girls.

00:08:03.737 --> 00:08:05.678
That's awful, Pero.

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:07.118
Yeah, pretty nasty.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:10.540
That's not what these competitions are for, you know.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.801
Gosh.

00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:18.523
Well, at least Moco-chan, he did get dressed up a little, right?

00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:19.203
Yeah, I guess.

00:08:19.243 --> 00:08:20.623
A little tie there.

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:22.124
It's good, yeah.

00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:25.005
Well, we're glad you found Pero.

00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:28.459
I guess, I guess.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:33.061
At least, are all the Ruffians happy he's back?

00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:34.861
Ruffians.

00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:40.804
It's questionable.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:42.545
Yes.

00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:45.946
Well, at least you're happy he's back, I guess.

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.719
As long as the Ruffians are smiling, right?

00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:50.840
Yeah, I'm happy that the Ruffians are happy.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.161
That makes me happy.

00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:57.642
But we still have more of a job to fulfill here, Moco-chan.

00:08:58.002 --> 00:08:59.943
FUWAMOCO Morning continues!

00:09:00.003 --> 00:09:01.244
BAU BAU!

00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:06.166
Thank you for keeping your eyes open, Ruffians.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.547
Even if maybe he's a big Ruffian.

00:09:11.388 --> 00:09:11.768
But!

00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:14.570
Happy New Year!

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:20.673
Yesterday, Ruffians, it was Nerissa's birthday!

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:21.614
Nerissa!

00:09:21.674 --> 00:09:23.755
BAU BAU!

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.596
And it was, of course, her birthday.

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.357
It's a day full of celebrations.

00:09:28.377 --> 00:09:29.498
That's what a birthday is!

00:09:29.758 --> 00:09:34.701
But not only just that, because it wasn't just her birthday.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:40.291
Also, because she hit 500,000 subscribers!

00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:43.713
Congratulations, Nerissa!

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:47.095
We're so so happy for her and all the JL friends!

00:09:47.335 --> 00:09:48.896
BAU BAU!

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:58.800
And you know, even on top of that, Nerissa released a new cover song of the opening theme of Elphelia and Lilium.

00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:03.974
Did you listen?

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.557
It's something else!

00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:15.866
This time, Nerissa's older sister, Anerissa, helped her with the low harmonies on it too, so it's not just Nerissa singing, it's also her sister.

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:19.509
For FUWAMOCO, it's kinda normal, but not for Nerissa.

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:22.012
That's really cool, right?

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:23.893
It's really, really cool.

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:27.015
Have you listened to Ruffians?

00:10:28.356 --> 00:10:30.136
It's a really, really amazing cover.

00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:32.057
It's very suited for her.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:33.257
The demon of sound.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:37.458
Even though some people say it's more angelic sounding.

00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:38.599
I don't know.

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:42.480
I feel like it's more demon.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.360
I feel like that.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.241
Like, I'm going to go

00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.704
It's gonna drive me crazy in a happy way.

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:52.589
In a happy way, right?

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.492
Like that, yeah.

00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:56.280
That's what the demon of sound does, maybe a bit.

00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:06.050
Actually, Ruffians, it was really just recently that we finally finished watching Alkaline.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.670
Right!

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.991
We're glad that we watched it, but it was definitely something else.

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.491
It was something else.

00:11:12.711 --> 00:11:14.352
Why did you think of the anime, Ruffians?

00:11:14.372 --> 00:11:15.252
Did you watch it?

00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:19.453
Maybe many years ago and FUWAMOCO just kind of late to the party.

00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:20.493
Is it a party?

00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:22.014
I don't know if it's a party.

00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:23.454
Late to something.

00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:25.734
A very interesting party.

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.575
It was something alright.

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:29.436
Intense.

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.218
Oh, intensely different.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.701
It was an anime.

00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:36.382
It was an anime.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.463
That's good.

00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:39.284
That's a good statement.

00:11:39.304 --> 00:11:39.785
Yes.

00:11:41.987 --> 00:11:43.768
It was different.

00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:46.570
But fun fact about FUWAMOCO.

00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:51.274
Yeah, we've also sung in Latin quite a bit before too.

00:11:51.354 --> 00:11:52.315
Are you surprised?

00:11:53.496 --> 00:11:59.678
FUWAMOCO can sing a lot.

00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:05.599
It's really pretty, so you know it's nice to hear Nerissa sing a lot too.

00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:07.159
But, but, but, but, but, but!

00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:08.840
Also!

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.161
Nerissa teased her upcoming first original song too!

00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:15.741
Are you surprised?

00:12:17.962 --> 00:12:19.702
We can't wait, Ruffians!

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:21.643
You know this, right?

00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:28.809
She also shared with us her birthday wish!

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:59.697
It's released, but it includes a framed artboard, a t-shirt, a pin badge, and also a really cute ribbon-style keychain.

00:12:59.757 --> 00:13:01.779
It's all included in the merch set.

00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:05.261
It's Nerissa's very first birthday.

00:13:05.421 --> 00:13:06.322
It's not sold out.

00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:10.825
It's just the special limited edition version.

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:12.427
You can still get it.

00:13:13.207 --> 00:13:14.868
The limited sold out, but...

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:22.186
I know it's a bit frustrating, but it's also, you know, happy for Nerissa's birthday, right?

00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:24.107
But I really do love the keychain.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.609
It just looks so cute and fashionable.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:27.949
Just like Nerissa!

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:34.473
You know, it's kind of like a little piece of Nerissa that you can carry around with you, right?

00:13:34.493 --> 00:13:36.374
It's pretty cute.

00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:38.415
Put it on your bag, on your keys.

00:13:38.475 --> 00:13:40.496
Where else could you put it?

00:13:40.856 --> 00:13:43.678
Ruffians, do you have any ideas or places to put Nerissa?

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:47.492
Do you have a spot to put a keychain on your tummy?

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:50.495
Ruffians, that's weird.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:05.970
And a birdhouse?

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.271
A birdhouse would be really good!

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.412
Yeah, I like that.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.892
I guess they like shiny stuff, huh?

00:14:11.032 --> 00:14:12.433
I think a birdhouse would be good.

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:15.134
Car keys, car keys too.

00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:16.375
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:18.936
Oh well, there's lots of possibilities.

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:19.356
Yes!

00:14:19.416 --> 00:14:22.857
Please check it out if you love Nerissa as much as we do!

00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:23.378
Yes!

00:14:23.858 --> 00:14:24.458
BAU BAU!

00:14:24.518 --> 00:14:26.619
BAU BAU!

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:27.079
What?

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.540
On the topic of a...

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:31.729
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:48.133
Wow!

00:14:49.374 --> 00:14:50.354
Ruffians!

00:14:50.894 --> 00:14:51.934
Shiori!

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:57.136
Shiori released her 7-day cruise abroad!

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:00.297
It was really, really funny.

00:15:00.377 --> 00:15:01.817
And really personal, too.

00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:04.558
I feel like we got to see a bit more of what Shiori was like.

00:15:04.598 --> 00:15:10.419
You know, she went on her cruise trip and we were like, Shiori, why?

00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:15.601
Before FUWAMOCO, we never ever even dreamed of going on a cruise trip before.

00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:16.001
No.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:24.586
I feel like she did a rather good job of selling us on the fact that cruises are not for us.

00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:26.667
Not for us.

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:26.968
No.

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:39.499
You know the idea of being trapped on a boat with thousands of people and only able to watch the performances and wait around in a pool and gamble and eat and drink.

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:40.099
No.

00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:43.082
I don't think it's for us.

00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:43.162
No.

00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:46.188
We're demon guide dogs, not cruisers!

00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:04.723
Yeah, it was really cute.

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:08.325
You know it's very professional with like a shiori flavor.

00:16:08.365 --> 00:16:09.186
Very, very cute.

00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:10.247
Tasted like a bookmark.

00:16:10.587 --> 00:16:10.887
What?

00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:15.070
It tastes like a bookmark with a shiori flavor.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.130
Oh.

00:16:18.032 --> 00:16:21.414
Well, we hope that she makes more vlogs, yeah?

00:16:21.454 --> 00:16:23.676
But we also want to stay close with her, you know?

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:24.957
Yeah.

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:25.737
Oh?

00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:30.401
Maybe a solution would be that

00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:35.953
We're taking an advent vacation trip somewhere all together!

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.094
Advent trip.

00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:39.414
Would you like to see a vlog from something like that?

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.455
That would be so chaotic.

00:16:41.555 --> 00:16:43.135
Are we sure we're gonna survive?

00:16:43.155 --> 00:16:44.196
I don't know.

00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:45.996
It'd be very, very chaotic.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:52.378
What happens if we went to like a lake and then we like, you know, threw the rocks into the lake?

00:16:52.418 --> 00:16:54.358
Yeah, yeah, like the, what's it?

00:16:54.378 --> 00:16:55.959
The rock, rock throwing.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:57.500
BAU BAU!

00:17:18.852 --> 00:17:21.834
Well, Ruffians, we have more happy news!

00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:25.737
There's also something very exciting happening!

00:17:25.877 --> 00:17:27.518
This time there's no rocks involved.

00:17:27.758 --> 00:17:28.059
No!

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.900
But there's watermelons.

00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:36.599
Because FUWAMOCO Suiko got an O.K.!

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:42.583
And we just found out that FUWAMOCO has been included in the most- Yay!

00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:48.587
No, they added IA and IDEA members, but they chose us to represent Alphys!

00:17:48.788 --> 00:17:49.848
BAU BAU!

00:17:49.888 --> 00:17:52.230
We're so thankful!

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.272
Is this the first FUWAMOCO appearance in a game?

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:57.473
Really?

00:17:58.154 --> 00:17:59.435
Ruffians, you know.

00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:12.845
You know, and also what we very much appreciate is that even though we are twins and we do have only one YouTube channel between us, we're tweeted.

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:18.349
We're treated as two different people, you know?

00:18:18.369 --> 00:18:20.151
Because we're individuals.

00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:21.552
I'm Mococo.

00:18:21.912 --> 00:18:22.672
I'm Fuwawa.

00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:23.333
Exactly.

00:18:23.793 --> 00:18:26.155
So that really means a lot to us too.

00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:27.876
It's important to us.

00:18:27.936 --> 00:18:28.837
But, but, but!

00:18:29.157 --> 00:18:31.939
Ruffians, do you also know what this club means?

00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:38.467
We hope that you're ready for some more holo no Suika!

00:18:38.487 --> 00:18:42.090
Yeah, cause we're gonna be playing it again sometime soon.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.531
Sometime soon, you know.

00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:43.932
Yeah.

00:18:43.952 --> 00:18:44.952
It's been a little while.

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:46.053
It's been a little while.

00:18:46.073 --> 00:18:47.214
We wanna play more.

00:18:47.274 --> 00:18:47.374
Yeah.

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:50.616
I feel hungry for the holo no Suika.

00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:52.578
We were just feeling like that the other day, huh?

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:52.758
Right!

00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:55.978
It's the perfect time.

00:18:55.998 --> 00:19:03.121
I really wanted to say thank you to Ponzu and TKT Games for adding us to the game too.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.082
BAU BAU!

00:19:05.242 --> 00:19:06.203
Exciting!

00:19:06.723 --> 00:19:08.484
Great livestream probably not that soon.

00:19:08.964 --> 00:19:10.064
Don't worry.

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:14.266
By soon enough, okay.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.967
BAU BAU!

00:19:16.227 --> 00:19:17.868
It's a good morning, right?

00:19:17.908 --> 00:19:19.829
Lots of exciting things happening.

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:24.542
So many wonderful friends, too.

00:19:24.602 --> 00:19:26.704
Having exciting things happening.

00:19:27.344 --> 00:19:28.245
Very exciting times.

00:19:28.305 --> 00:19:30.006
Happiness by osmosis.

00:19:36.032 --> 00:19:37.733
And that's where it ends.

00:19:38.774 --> 00:19:39.515
If for goodness.

00:19:41.036 --> 00:19:41.957
Okay, Ruffians.

00:19:42.477 --> 00:19:43.238
Ruffians!

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:45.920
You have to tell us something, okay?

00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:57.301
You know that we've tried very, very, very hard recently not to make any more misunderstandings, right?

00:19:57.641 --> 00:20:02.142
And you think we've done a good job, right?

00:20:02.822 --> 00:20:04.042
We've done well, right?

00:20:04.963 --> 00:20:05.483
Right.

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:10.764
We've been doing a good job, no more misunderstandings!

00:20:10.804 --> 00:20:14.145
By the way, seeing comments being like, yes, you did a good job, Mococo!

00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:24.332
Anyways!

00:20:24.352 --> 00:20:33.676
This wasn't supposed to happen, but... It was Nerissa's birthday, right?

00:20:35.017 --> 00:20:35.757
And of course!

00:20:36.157 --> 00:20:36.958
We talked about it!

00:20:37.198 --> 00:20:38.679
We wanted to get her a present!

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:45.582
But you know... People always like it when you make something special for them, right?

00:20:46.598 --> 00:20:47.679
It was from the heart.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.781
You know, so we did!

00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:51.642
We did that.

00:20:52.182 --> 00:20:55.485
We gave her a special FUWAMOCO birthday coupon.

00:20:57.386 --> 00:20:58.567
Just like that!

00:20:58.948 --> 00:20:59.808
Like that.

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:02.670
Yeah, birthday coupon!

00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:04.072
Birthday coupon.

00:21:04.112 --> 00:21:05.212
That's something normal.

00:21:05.493 --> 00:21:06.533
Birthday coupon.

00:21:06.634 --> 00:21:10.517
You know, so that she can redeem it for one touch.

00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:14.320
That's only one touch between the both of us.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:14.560
Yeah.

00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:16.639
Not one touch, Fuwawa.

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:17.940
One touch, Mococo.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.960
No, no, no.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.320
Only one touch.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.201
Just one touch.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:22.561
Yeah.

00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:28.502
And you know, on the back of the coupon, it says, no ears, no tail.

00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:28.782
No.

00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:29.802
Yeah.

00:21:30.303 --> 00:21:30.583
Yeah.

00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:32.363
But, Ruffians!

00:21:33.603 --> 00:21:34.744
Ruffians!

00:21:35.664 --> 00:21:39.685
You've decided to erase Nerissa's name and put yours on it?

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:41.880
Huh?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.521
What are you doing?

00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:45.561
What are you doing?

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:47.741
Oh my gosh.

00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:48.122
No.

00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:51.682
This is Nerissa's birthday gift for her.

00:21:52.362 --> 00:21:53.063
Not yours.

00:21:53.383 --> 00:21:53.623
No.

00:21:54.403 --> 00:21:54.643
No.

00:21:55.663 --> 00:21:56.503
Can't do that.

00:21:56.523 --> 00:21:57.624
Can't do it.

00:21:58.004 --> 00:21:58.344
Can't.

00:21:58.464 --> 00:21:58.864
Yeah.

00:21:59.204 --> 00:22:06.726
And see, now, now Ruffians, you're printing the coupons out by the hundreds, by the thousands!

00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:08.026
That's not okay!

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:08.466
No, no.

00:22:10.146 --> 00:22:11.049
Oh my gosh.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.913
Ruffians!

00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:15.680
You know that's not how things work, right?

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:17.419
Right.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.962
You know, I keep track of who gets coupons from me.

00:22:20.982 --> 00:22:26.987
So you can't just pretend and try to fool me by saying that I would've made a ton of coupons like that!

00:22:27.808 --> 00:22:28.908
It's special, okay?

00:22:29.509 --> 00:22:31.791
It's just for Nerissa, you know it!

00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:34.693
So you better be careful, okay?

00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:37.775
We'll remember those who try funny stuff, okay?

00:22:38.236 --> 00:22:39.817
I have a good memory, you know that.

00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:40.578
I do too.

00:22:40.938 --> 00:22:42.499
Even a better memory than Moco-chan.

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:44.281
Does it have to be a competition?

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.380
Got it?

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.161
Be careful, okay?

00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:49.861
Watch yourself.

00:22:50.222 --> 00:22:50.502
Yeah.

00:22:53.783 --> 00:22:56.284
You won't get past the eyes of FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:22:57.005 --> 00:22:58.485
Yeah.

00:22:58.505 --> 00:22:59.766
Demon guard dog eyes.

00:23:00.626 --> 00:23:01.487
BAU BAU.

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:05.169
BAU BAU.

00:23:05.469 --> 00:23:05.769
Well.

00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.749
Well.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.111
Ruffians, you know how to behave now, right?

00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:11.471
You know how to behave!

00:23:15.053 --> 00:23:16.554
You know how to behave!

00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:20.472
You always know how.

00:23:20.492 --> 00:23:21.472
Know it!

00:23:21.492 --> 00:23:21.813
Thank you.

00:23:22.073 --> 00:23:22.813
Thank you.

00:23:22.954 --> 00:23:23.514
Know it!

00:23:23.554 --> 00:23:25.556
That one Ruffian said yes.

00:23:25.856 --> 00:23:26.937
They always have.

00:23:27.457 --> 00:23:28.838
And I believe you.

00:23:29.038 --> 00:23:29.559
I trust you.

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:30.319
I believe you, okay?

00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:31.900
I believe you.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.041
You'll behave too.

00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:33.822
You'll behave.

00:23:33.942 --> 00:23:35.703
Good, good, good, good.

00:23:35.823 --> 00:23:36.984
You do your best honest.

00:23:37.064 --> 00:23:41.407
That's good.

00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:42.849
Maybe.

00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:44.310
Maybe then.

00:23:46.986 --> 00:24:02.114
If you're being good, which I'm not sure about, but if you're being good, then if you need a little bit of a push, maybe, maybe I'll give it to you.

00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:09.778
Ruffians!

00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:12.039
Ruffians!

00:24:12.139 --> 00:24:13.540
Good morning!

00:24:14.591 --> 00:24:16.292
Good morning!

00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:17.313
You're up!

00:24:18.113 --> 00:24:19.714
It might still be dark out.

00:24:20.274 --> 00:24:22.596
It might still be cold outside of your bed.

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:25.217
But, you did it!

00:24:25.858 --> 00:24:31.801
Now, splash some water on that cute face of yours and let's get ready to make today ours!

00:24:32.622 --> 00:24:35.563
You made it this far in the week, and that's amazing!

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:38.965
No matter how hard each day is, you keep going.

00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:41.387
And you really need to give yourself some credit for that.

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.632
But also!

00:24:44.353 --> 00:24:48.457
It's important to know when you need to give yourself a bit of time to rest and recover, okay?

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:50.820
Don't think of it as a break.

00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:55.184
Think of it as another important duty to keep yourself going.

00:24:55.765 --> 00:24:56.145
Okay?

00:24:57.707 --> 00:24:59.208
But, do it.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:05.295
Do also make sure to give yourself an actual break to do the things that you like.

00:25:06.303 --> 00:25:07.943
It's an important break for your heart!

00:25:08.603 --> 00:25:10.964
And you know, your heart is precious.

00:25:11.604 --> 00:25:16.845
You need to keep it healthy, and safe, and warm up every day, okay?

00:25:18.325 --> 00:25:20.066
Anyways, it's Wednesday!

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:22.266
The weekend is almost here!

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:28.688
Let's warm up the body for the day, warm up our hearts with a smile, and tackle the day!

00:25:29.248 --> 00:25:30.228
You can do it!

00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:34.349
I believe that you'll get past any obstacles you come across today.

00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:35.149
Okay?

00:25:36.124 --> 00:25:37.384
You're amazing!

00:25:37.965 --> 00:25:39.125
You can do it!

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:41.706
Let's do it all together, okay?

00:25:41.726 --> 00:25:43.507
Ganbatte da!

00:25:43.547 --> 00:25:48.508
BAU BAU!

00:25:48.628 --> 00:25:51.749
Let's do it all together today!

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.351
BAU BAU!

00:25:57.531 --> 00:25:59.772
We have our Doggie of the Day next.

00:25:59.812 --> 00:26:00.753
Doggie of the Day!

00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:03.033
I want to see a cute doggy of today.

00:26:03.493 --> 00:26:04.734
Well, we have...

00:26:05.558 --> 00:26:07.520
De-den!

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:08.961
Morgan!

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.122
Morgan!

00:26:10.342 --> 00:26:12.243
Today's Doggie of the Day is Morgan.

00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:14.065
What's wrong with Morgan?

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:15.086
Oh well...

00:26:17.668 --> 00:26:22.793
Morgan's kind of a bit gloomy because she doesn't like suitcases, you know?

00:26:23.413 --> 00:26:28.618
She sees a suitcase, she says, oh my gosh, am I going to be left behind?

00:26:29.058 --> 00:26:30.279
But that's not true!

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.164
Yeah, but it doesn't still stop her from looking like the saddest puppy ever.

00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:39.548
You know, I can totally understand sometimes.

00:26:41.209 --> 00:26:41.970
Does she need a hug?

00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:47.518
I need to hug Morgan!

00:26:48.438 --> 00:26:52.539
You know, I also want to rub my fingers down the caramel streak on her head.

00:26:52.579 --> 00:26:55.040
You see right in between the eyes.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.640
Me too!

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.760
Very cute.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.341
Caramel streak.

00:27:03.022 --> 00:27:04.622
Don't worry Morgan, it's okay.

00:27:04.862 --> 00:27:07.423
Well, um, how does Morgan BAU BAU?

00:27:07.463 --> 00:27:09.984
Maybe you know where she sees the suitcases?

00:27:11.204 --> 00:27:11.244
Ah.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:39.253
Like that. Maybe I don't know if we're capturing the sadness enough. That's good, that's good. Pretty good. You know, Morgan loves you and your little sister. That's what makes her dislike the suitcases so much. It makes sense.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.410
BAU BAU!

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:07.540
Wow, Ruffians, have you been out and about going for walks?

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.303
Let's see, we have... De-den!

00:28:11.364 --> 00:28:11.884
Wow!

00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:20.169
It's another Mococo Sky!

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.330
I feel like we've had a lot of Mococo Skies recently.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.031
I don't know.

00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:27.092
It's just the Mococo Sky kind of time of year, you know?

00:28:27.192 --> 00:28:29.573
Have I been missing out on calling every sky?

00:28:29.693 --> 00:28:31.473
It's a Fuwawa Sky!

00:28:31.494 --> 00:28:32.574
Have I?

00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:35.355
Just because it's blue, you can't call it a Fuwawa Sky, okay?

00:28:35.695 --> 00:28:37.036
I can and I want!

00:28:37.056 --> 00:28:37.736
You can!

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.177
Ah, well, it's so pretty, you know?

00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:42.658
Early morning walks are really nice.

00:28:42.718 --> 00:28:43.318
Yeah!

00:28:43.358 --> 00:28:44.418
The air is so fresh.

00:28:44.438 --> 00:28:44.899
Fresh.

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:45.799
No one's around.

00:28:46.243 --> 00:28:47.166
Ah, it's silent.

00:28:47.406 --> 00:28:49.833
Right, the world is ready for you to discover.

00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:50.936
Ah, it's just the birds.

00:28:53.034 --> 00:28:58.919
As for us watching the sunrise, well, we see the sunrise, ah, we saw it last, yes, today!

00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.980
Last, yes, yes.

00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:02.763
When did we see it?

00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:03.463
Today!

00:29:03.483 --> 00:29:04.124
Today!

00:29:04.204 --> 00:29:06.386
Yeah, we see it all the time, you know.

00:29:06.426 --> 00:29:07.547
I like to watch the sunrise.

00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:19.236
Yeah, especially mornings with the FUWAMOCO Morning, so... You know, sometimes, especially when you feel like, ah, I can't get out of bed, it's nice just to watch the sunrise or look outside at the sun.

00:29:20.097 --> 00:29:21.618
And then you feel a bit better, okay?

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:25.660
And then there's the sometimes where you're like, looking really hard late at night.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.543
And then before you know it, you look outside and you're like, why are you... Why is the sun here, hai?

00:29:32.063 --> 00:29:33.884
Why'd you show your face here, hai?

00:29:33.904 --> 00:29:34.044
Yeah.

00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:36.145
Sometimes, sometimes.

00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:37.786
This sometimes, sometimes.

00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:42.137
Everyday sky is Fuwawa Sky.

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.517
Thank you!

00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:45.759
And that sky is beautiful, right?

00:29:46.459 --> 00:29:47.300
Right?

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:47.680
Right.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.502
Fuwawa Sky is beautiful, right?

00:29:50.542 --> 00:29:52.663
Mococo Sky is beautiful.

00:29:53.244 --> 00:29:56.486
BAU BAU!

00:29:57.726 --> 00:30:00.568
And for our Question of the Day, we have...

00:30:02.213 --> 00:30:03.434
De-den!

00:30:03.975 --> 00:30:04.976
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:05.917
Hello!

00:30:06.158 --> 00:30:11.865
Is there any preferred clothing or fashion you like to wear in winter that you don't usually wear in the other seasons?

00:30:12.305 --> 00:30:14.528
We got this for a taste in fashion.

00:30:14.588 --> 00:30:14.868
What?

00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:18.532
So I'd like to see if you pass the test of this test.

00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:19.854
Thanks for the saves, Fuwawa!

00:30:19.874 --> 00:30:20.435
What do you mean?

00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:22.317
What do you mean?

00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:24.338
This for your fashion?

00:30:24.919 --> 00:30:26.280
We never said anything.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.542
We just said that black and black isn't good, right?

00:30:29.602 --> 00:30:31.563
Yeah, you want to be visible.

00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:32.964
Especially in the winter.

00:30:32.984 --> 00:30:35.226
Especially in the winter, you can't just wear all black.

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:36.027
That's dangerous.

00:30:36.107 --> 00:30:37.968
That's dangerous, yeah.

00:30:37.988 --> 00:30:40.010
But winter clothing!

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.372
Sweaters!

00:30:43.432 --> 00:30:43.812
Sweaters!

00:30:43.932 --> 00:30:44.533
Wow, that was a lot.

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:45.550
Sweaters.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:45.970
Sweaters.

00:30:46.251 --> 00:30:50.395
Yeah, sweaters are great because they're warm and comfy and fluffy and fuzzy!

00:30:51.196 --> 00:30:51.877
They're cute.

00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:52.938
They're cute.

00:30:53.058 --> 00:30:55.081
Fluffy and fuzzy is good!

00:30:55.121 --> 00:31:00.647
You know, they're extra cute, especially when, you know, they have turtle bags, or they have the moist sleeves!

00:31:00.687 --> 00:31:02.149
You know, it's kinda long and...

00:31:02.589 --> 00:31:05.911
It makes you feel more... You know, it has the vertical ribs.

00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:07.252
Not horizontal!

00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:08.092
Vertical ribs.

00:31:08.152 --> 00:31:09.613
Say that again!

00:31:09.633 --> 00:31:10.534
Vertical ribs.

00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:11.094
Say it again!

00:31:11.274 --> 00:31:12.375
Vertical ribs.

00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:13.715
Say it again!

00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:14.276
What?

00:31:14.296 --> 00:31:15.096
Not horizontal.

00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:16.917
Vertical.

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:21.120
Yeah.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.460
Yeah!

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.121
It's very cute!

00:31:24.181 --> 00:31:25.842
Ruffians, you agree, right?

00:31:25.862 --> 00:31:28.003
I did say vertical.

00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:28.964
Vertical.

00:31:32.722 --> 00:31:32.762
Hi!

00:31:32.782 --> 00:31:33.963
We wouldn't want that.

00:31:34.003 --> 00:31:35.083
We wouldn't, well...

00:32:02.335 --> 00:32:04.537
What's going on, Ruffians?

00:32:04.777 --> 00:32:05.258
What's going on?

00:32:23.654 --> 00:32:25.855
Shiori is the word?

00:32:26.015 --> 00:32:27.936
That's not the word I wanted.

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:29.376
But scarves!

00:32:29.777 --> 00:32:32.138
Scarves are great too!

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:38.080
It's hard to find them, so sometimes it's best to make it yourself.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:47.184
But I like scarves that are so long that we can both wear them.

00:32:48.044 --> 00:32:50.185
One scarf for both of us!

00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:55.493
It works well.

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:57.014
But it's very long.

00:32:57.394 --> 00:32:58.315
Very long.

00:32:58.335 --> 00:33:00.976
I think we passed your test.

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.698
You can't say we didn't pass it.

00:33:02.958 --> 00:33:06.420
Peak fashion is when you wear a scarf for two people.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:06.720
Got it!

00:33:09.802 --> 00:33:11.163
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.243 --> 00:33:15.003
Thank you so much for all your submissions, Ruffians!

00:33:15.383 --> 00:33:24.185
Remember, we're always looking for more, so please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:33:24.425 --> 00:33:26.446
BAU BAU!

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:31.647
Now for our next stream, we have De-den!

00:33:31.847 --> 00:33:35.268
Today we're gonna be taking the rest of the day to

00:33:36.755 --> 00:33:38.775
We need to make it special, Moco-chan.

00:34:05.979 --> 00:34:09.081
It doesn't need to be special Ruffians!

00:34:09.482 --> 00:34:13.165
Wait, is it okay if it's just... just us?

00:34:14.827 --> 00:34:20.592
I guess that's a good question too.

00:34:20.732 --> 00:34:22.254
Every stream is special!

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:25.969
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:29.693
Coughed up ASMR!

00:34:29.733 --> 00:34:32.056
Just crunching, just crunching.

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:32.757
Why?

00:34:33.758 --> 00:34:35.259
No just chatting, just crunching.

00:34:36.301 --> 00:34:39.164
But we hope that you'll join us and that you'll be really happy.

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:39.644
BAU BAU!

00:34:57.558 --> 00:35:01.860
Ruffians, we talked about it a lot, but that's because this weekend is a big one for us!

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.622
We have a collab, our first collab with Rui-ne-senpai!

00:35:06.882 --> 00:35:10.243
Because you know, it's twin day, and Rui-ne, she loves twins.

00:35:10.423 --> 00:35:14.485
And we're twins, so we're gonna talk about twins on twin day.

00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:21.008
But no pressure on Rui-ne-senpai to love us or anything, it's okay.

00:35:21.028 --> 00:35:22.568
There's a lot of twins in Hawaii.

00:35:22.628 --> 00:35:24.169
I don't know if we can fit that.

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.849
It might already be full.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.030
It might be occupied.

00:35:27.563 --> 00:35:34.606
But after that too, we'll be having a new cover song coming out, a FUWAMOCO cover song.

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:42.609
You know, and for us, these kind of times are very special to us, so we really hope that you'll be there.

00:35:42.629 --> 00:35:46.030
To be like, wow, FUWAMOCO, this is exciting!

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.931
And listen to it.

00:35:47.091 --> 00:35:47.391
Yeah.

00:35:47.782 --> 00:35:48.202
Thank you.

00:35:48.242 --> 00:35:58.265
We really put a lot of work into it, so... And we're gonna continue to put a lot of work into it until we're able to share it with you, so... Please look forward to it!

00:35:58.385 --> 00:36:00.025
BAU BAU!

00:36:00.066 --> 00:36:01.466
We're gonna do our best!

00:36:01.886 --> 00:36:05.247
Thank you so much, FUWAMOCO!

00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:08.608
Well, I have a good feeling about today, right, Moco-chan?

00:36:08.648 --> 00:36:09.608
It's gonna be a good day.

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:11.449
It's gonna be a good day, so let's do our best!

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.969
Let's make it a good day all together, okay, Ruffians?

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.130
All together!

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.175
Ruffians, thank you for joining us for today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:20.756 --> 00:36:27.084
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:36:28.487 --> 00:36:29.187

00:36:54.247 --> 00:37:00.030
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.110
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:02.911
