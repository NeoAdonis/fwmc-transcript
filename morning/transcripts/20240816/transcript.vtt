04:59.740 --> 05:01.661
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:02.382 --> 05:05.564
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:05.584 --> 05:09.586
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:09.686 --> 05:10.687
BAU BAU!

05:11.387 --> 05:15.069
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:15.569 --> 05:17.951
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.992
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:20.012 --> 05:20.933
BAU BAU!

05:22.772 --> 05:26.893
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:26.913 --> 05:27.974
Yeah!

05:28.054 --> 05:32.335
Thank you Ruffians for joining us for our 119th episode!

05:32.535 --> 05:35.596
Not our 19th episode.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.717
No, 119th episode!

05:37.737 --> 05:38.857
119th episode!

05:38.997 --> 05:40.658
BAU BAU!

05:41.218 --> 05:41.358
Yeah!

05:41.398 --> 05:41.698
BAU BAU!

05:41.738 --> 05:43.359
That was 120 episodes!

05:44.359 --> 05:46.540
Which means it's almost our 125th episode.

05:58.066 --> 06:02.107
It's the last FUWAMOCO Morning before a very fun weekend!

06:05.568 --> 06:09.369
I'm sure it's been a tough week for all of you!

06:09.509 --> 06:11.230
The last FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:13.280 --> 06:15.161
Before a very fun weekend!

06:17.502 --> 06:18.103
Yeah!

06:18.383 --> 06:19.623
Hi!

06:20.304 --> 06:24.366
It's not the last FUWAMOCO Morning, just the last one before a very fun weekend!

06:24.846 --> 06:28.668
And so next weekend will also be a very fun weekend because it's Breaking Dimensions!

06:28.688 --> 06:31.349
We'll also have a last one before a very fun weekend!

06:32.841 --> 06:33.581
Hi!

06:33.921 --> 06:39.486
For the Ruffians who are joining us maybe for the first time and thinking, what the heck is going on?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.748
Right, you scared me!

06:41.768 --> 06:41.808
Hi.

06:42.368 --> 06:48.974
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:49.174 --> 06:50.595
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:50.856 --> 06:52.137
And it's hosted by us!

06:52.797 --> 06:54.298
FUWAMOCO!

06:54.318 --> 07:00.660
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

07:00.780 --> 07:05.622
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

07:05.962 --> 07:09.683
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:10.204 --> 07:12.044
BAU BAU!

07:12.064 --> 07:15.806
Yeah! Are you awake, Ruffians? Are you ready to go?

07:15.826 --> 07:18.507
They will wake now that you said it's the last one, huh?

07:19.785 --> 07:21.966
I always say that by accident though.

07:22.086 --> 07:22.866
By accident?

07:22.966 --> 07:23.426
Really?

07:23.446 --> 07:23.906
Yeah.

07:24.406 --> 07:33.729
Just cause you know, once we get to the Friday episode of FUWAMOCO Morning every week, I'm always very happy because you know, it's another fun week.

07:33.749 --> 07:36.089
Another week we've had together, you know.

07:36.170 --> 07:37.510
You know.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.111
That's why it's the last FUWAMOCO Morning of the week.

07:41.511 --> 07:43.511
Buh-bye!

07:43.531 --> 07:44.292
Yeah!

07:45.032 --> 07:48.993
Well, the last episode of the week, but

07:50.624 --> 07:52.245
There's been another Pero sighting!

07:52.265 --> 07:54.706
I'm never excited for this.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.367
There's never the last one, huh?

07:57.608 --> 07:58.648
Okay, Ruffians.

07:59.309 --> 08:00.610
Where did you see him this time?

08:00.630 --> 08:03.251
Did you make sure to get rid of him?

08:04.232 --> 08:04.912
Let's take a walk.

08:05.598 --> 08:07.619
De-den!

08:10.181 --> 08:12.982
He looks sort of cute.

08:13.263 --> 08:14.523
A bit more square.

08:14.563 --> 08:22.448
Were you digging through your concert items and found Pero amongst them, maybe?

08:22.828 --> 08:24.289
I don't know though.

08:24.789 --> 08:25.450
Where's Pero?

08:27.731 --> 08:28.511
Yes!

08:28.751 --> 08:29.531
Yes!

08:30.792 --> 08:31.752
He's not nasty.

08:32.132 --> 08:32.912
Just sort of sweet.

08:33.032 --> 08:33.652
Yeah.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.773
Maybe it's all thanks to this Ruffian's handiwork.

08:35.833 --> 08:36.493
Right!

08:36.833 --> 08:39.694
And the Uchiwa is so cute too!

08:39.754 --> 08:41.314
BAU BAU SHITE!

08:41.534 --> 08:41.814
Yes!

08:41.894 --> 08:48.396
In case you don't know Ruffians, the Uchiwa, it's common to hold them up at concerts and have something like, wink at me!

08:48.456 --> 08:49.176
Or something on them.

08:49.396 --> 08:49.976
Yeah.

08:50.676 --> 08:52.977
But these ones say BAU BAU at me!

08:53.097 --> 08:53.917
Yeah!

08:53.997 --> 08:55.237
Super cute!

08:55.778 --> 08:56.378
Thank you!

08:56.618 --> 08:57.598
Moco-chan, silly.

08:57.878 --> 09:03.283
It's your day off on the right paw.

09:03.303 --> 09:03.944
BAU BAU!

09:04.244 --> 09:09.188
Maybe I'm a little happy this Pero's going to be cheering for us, you know?

09:09.268 --> 09:09.809
Maybe.

09:10.249 --> 09:10.750
Yeah.

09:10.950 --> 09:11.270
Huh?

09:13.092 --> 09:15.954
BAU BAU!

09:16.475 --> 09:17.576
That wasn't so bad.

09:17.636 --> 09:19.798
I guess this Pero sighting's not that nasty, huh?

09:20.418 --> 09:21.781
Alright.

09:22.803 --> 09:23.003
Yeah.

09:23.023 --> 09:23.564
Nice of you.

09:23.624 --> 09:24.065
Yeah.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.510
Pero looks a little flatter than usual.

09:26.570 --> 09:27.912
Kind of like you could sit on it.

09:28.883 --> 09:31.244
Maybe he's been sent one of these.

09:31.264 --> 09:32.965
Maybe.

09:33.045 --> 09:34.565
BAU BAU!

09:35.125 --> 09:36.246
Well, Ruffians!

09:36.266 --> 09:40.147
There's always something exciting going on within hololive.

09:40.508 --> 09:46.870
And within hololive English, something very exciting is happening, something very happy is happening.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.111
And, well, breaking dimensions.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.112
We've all heard of breaking dimensions.

09:52.390 --> 09:52.971
Wow!

09:53.491 --> 09:54.912
Carly-senpai!

09:54.952 --> 09:59.156
She just released her brand new album, FANTOMIME!

09:59.236 --> 10:00.177
BAU BAU!

10:00.417 --> 10:01.358
BAU BAU!

10:01.378 --> 10:02.519
Ah, Moco-chan.

10:02.599 --> 10:03.340
I misspelled it.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.381
You misspelled it.

10:04.661 --> 10:05.022
Yay!

10:05.322 --> 10:06.923
FANTOMIME.

10:07.143 --> 10:08.144
Oh, I misspelled.

10:08.244 --> 10:09.345
Oops.

10:10.687 --> 10:11.067
Phantom.

10:13.247 --> 10:17.873
Bye bye!

10:17.953 --> 10:21.037
But Phantom Mime, it's a full album with ten songs!

10:21.317 --> 10:27.425
And there's actually multiple bonus tracks depending on where you listen to it, or where you get your paws on it.

10:27.445 --> 10:28.286
Yeah, I love that!

10:28.306 --> 10:28.807
Buy it!

10:28.947 --> 10:29.968
And I have to buy them all.

10:30.248 --> 10:31.269
Right, you're like, oh!

10:31.569 --> 10:32.710
Okay, this one and that one.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.792
They need all the songs!

10:34.852 --> 10:36.414
Right, very smart.

10:36.954 --> 10:40.517
And a big congrats to Calli-senpai!

10:40.837 --> 10:44.480
A brand new album is not something that's done easily.

10:45.001 --> 10:47.303
I feel like, really, it was just the other day that

10:47.623 --> 10:49.606
Calli Senpai released her last EP.

10:49.687 --> 10:51.009
I thought it was an album!

10:51.610 --> 10:52.251
Yeah, right?

10:52.271 --> 10:53.433
It was such a good EP!

10:53.753 --> 10:57.259
It felt like there was so much content to it that it was a full album!

10:57.359 --> 10:57.880
Right!

10:58.040 --> 11:02.367
Yeah, but now she's here, she has some brand new amazing tracks.

11:02.687 --> 11:06.448
And of course, you know, Go-Getters has been really, really hype.

11:07.028 --> 11:09.208
Yeah, but now Go-Getters is here on the album.

11:09.248 --> 11:12.289
There's also a bonus track with another artist.

11:12.389 --> 11:14.189
You and I, we sing together.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.890
I really like that one too.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.030
Yeah, they're all amazing.

11:18.050 --> 11:23.191
Yeah, but we were really both surprised by Skeletons and Last Days.

11:23.211 --> 11:27.632
You know, the beginning of the album is very hype and intense.

11:28.032 --> 11:30.593
And then near the end, it's a bit more emotional.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.055
Bit more of a retrospective right now?

11:33.115 --> 11:33.536
What's the word?

11:33.616 --> 11:35.118
I don't know if it's retrospective.

11:35.138 --> 11:35.659
Ah, in what?

11:35.859 --> 11:36.500
Implecto?

11:37.481 --> 11:38.602
You know when you resp- ah.

11:38.722 --> 11:39.623
Interpersonal?

11:39.643 --> 11:44.069
What's the word when you look in words?

11:45.090 --> 11:46.071
Introspective!

11:46.412 --> 11:47.273
Is that the word?

11:52.538 --> 11:53.139
Thank you.

11:53.159 --> 11:54.019
Thank you.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.721
I'm tired to use the big words.

11:55.741 --> 11:58.883
Yeah.

11:58.943 --> 12:05.388
But last days especially, you know, both of them, they kind of, they're a little bit reminiscent of End of a Life.

12:05.468 --> 12:11.653
But last days, you know, it's like a little bit, like, you know, slower.

12:11.853 --> 12:12.574
Slower.

12:13.034 --> 12:13.435
More like...

12:14.578 --> 12:16.440
Relaxing in the beginning.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.943
I don't know if that's the right word and then it heats up.

12:18.983 --> 12:20.925
Yeah, I really like this.

12:20.985 --> 12:21.485
Yeah!

12:21.906 --> 12:24.368
We need to get our hands on the lyrics!

12:24.829 --> 12:25.169
The lyrics!

12:25.249 --> 12:28.632
I wanna know the lyrics!

12:28.753 --> 12:35.339
But you know, I think we can all tell just by listening that Calli-senpai put so much of herself into the album.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.761
Yeah, it's really, really beautiful.

12:38.281 --> 12:38.681
It's so nice.

12:38.741 --> 12:40.181
Calli-senpai of the now.

12:40.241 --> 12:41.622
Yeah, this is that!

12:41.942 --> 12:45.944
Calli-senpai of the now, you know, after all the experiences!

12:46.244 --> 12:50.705
And you know, we're also so happy because we were able to call in to her stream!

12:50.785 --> 12:51.245
Yeah!

12:51.265 --> 12:53.586
We were able to talk to her about it as well!

12:54.887 --> 12:57.308
Congratulations on everything!

12:57.568 --> 12:58.548
We're so happy.

12:59.829 --> 13:05.912
Calli's supposed to be actually doing a mini 3D live today to celebrate the release.

13:06.112 --> 13:08.393
So please check it out!

13:08.433 --> 13:09.354
Don't miss it, okay?

13:09.394 --> 13:12.136
Congratulations, Calli!

13:12.176 --> 13:16.138
Congratulations!

13:16.258 --> 13:16.598
BAU BAU!

13:16.618 --> 13:16.938
BAU BAU!

13:16.978 --> 13:17.999
Cowboy Tanaka.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.421
You're a completely different person.

13:21.501 --> 13:21.721
Right.

13:21.941 --> 13:22.161
Yeah.

13:24.242 --> 13:25.143
BAU BAU!

13:25.203 --> 13:26.384
BAU BAU!

13:26.624 --> 13:32.829
Wow, there's also something else that's been, uh, kind of, uh, funny?

13:33.169 --> 13:34.470
Kind of buggy?

13:34.550 --> 13:34.950
Buggy?

13:35.010 --> 13:37.252
Going on a whole life!

13:37.332 --> 13:37.792
Yeah!

13:38.092 --> 13:42.976
You know the other day during our off-club karaoke with you, we sung a bunch of songs.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.677
We did a prank.

13:44.737 --> 13:45.578
We pranked her.

13:48.205 --> 13:48.706
Biboo, you were pranked!

13:48.726 --> 13:49.247
You were pranked!

13:49.267 --> 13:59.107
BAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUBAUB

14:00.422 --> 14:01.443
And it was locusts.

14:01.683 --> 14:02.203
Yeah.

14:04.224 --> 14:04.625
Yeah.

14:04.765 --> 14:05.585
BAU BAU!

14:05.665 --> 14:07.366
BAU BAU!

14:07.406 --> 14:19.093
But you know it was payback for the natto grape, and... You know, Biboo was screaming a bunch, but... I think a lot of pebbles were concerned, but Biboo was not harmed in the making of this.

14:19.113 --> 14:19.674
She was not harmed!

14:19.694 --> 14:21.895
No Biboo's, no rocks were harmed in the making.

14:22.015 --> 14:22.295
No!

14:22.535 --> 14:23.036
Yeah.

14:23.636 --> 14:28.259
And we laughed and laughed afterwards, and we had some delicious leaves and tea together.

14:28.919 --> 14:29.460
Yeah.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.401
No walks were harmed.

14:31.421 --> 14:32.622
No walks were harmed.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.744
And actually, Ruffians!

14:35.284 --> 14:38.046
Mane-chan had a bite of them as well!

14:38.347 --> 14:39.007
And she was like, oh!

14:39.347 --> 14:40.088
Actually, these are so good.

14:40.108 --> 14:40.789
These are pretty good.

14:40.809 --> 14:41.709
I could have this on rice.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.831
Yeah, this would be great on rice.

14:44.391 --> 14:44.732
Let's go.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.474
No rocks were harmed.

14:46.554 --> 14:47.475
No rocks were harmed.

14:47.695 --> 14:48.035
Yeah.

14:49.476 --> 14:52.538
But the candy bugs, they taste really good like candy.

14:52.598 --> 14:53.519
Sort of like that.

14:53.779 --> 14:54.480
They're crunchy.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.401
Yeah.

14:55.481 --> 14:56.561
You wouldn't think it's an elephant.

14:56.602 --> 14:58.383
Biboo sure screamed a lot though, huh?

14:58.403 --> 14:59.464
Yeah, they don't look great.

14:59.924 --> 15:01.785
You know, I think that's the worst thing.

15:02.146 --> 15:04.648
You have to get over the eyes and the legs.

15:05.228 --> 15:06.129
Yeah.

15:06.609 --> 15:06.969
Yeah.

15:07.510 --> 15:08.411
It's a bit of a hurdle.

15:08.471 --> 15:08.651
Yeah.

15:11.940 --> 15:14.781
You should try it too someday, Ruffian!

15:15.162 --> 15:20.325
But you know... Well... We had some after Biboo had her fill.

15:20.365 --> 15:23.227
And we thought... I could go for some more.

15:23.267 --> 15:32.433
So after that... We had Bugs with V-shinpai and her jabu-shinpai!

15:32.533 --> 15:34.834
And we turned it into a potluck!

15:35.014 --> 15:38.056
We had a sudden off-collab with both of them.

15:39.583 --> 15:40.724
Totsu Ofukurao!

15:40.764 --> 15:41.124
Yeah!

15:41.164 --> 15:45.787
And Hajama and Vei-senpai, cause you know, we're all sort of there at the studio.

15:46.107 --> 15:46.347
Yeah!

15:46.467 --> 15:49.990
And we brought our locusts to Biboo's leftover breakfast.

15:50.010 --> 15:50.990
At the top there.

15:51.130 --> 15:53.872
Yeah, and we also brought a friend you can't quite see.

15:53.892 --> 15:55.013
Ah, you can't quite see him.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.354
Kind of kissing the tarantula.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.455
But he's not edible.

15:58.655 --> 15:59.016
No.

15:59.056 --> 15:59.956
We brought him home.

16:00.116 --> 16:02.718
Yeah, he was edible, but then some other bugs got him.

16:02.778 --> 16:03.619
Now he's empty.

16:03.739 --> 16:05.860
He's empty on the inside, they already ate him.

16:06.020 --> 16:06.380
Yeah.

16:07.782 --> 16:08.884
Our cicada friend!

16:09.244 --> 16:10.827
We saw him and we waited!

16:11.068 --> 16:13.051
We waited until no one was around!

16:13.472 --> 16:16.959
And then I snuck him into the bag containing Nerissa's hair.

16:16.979 --> 16:17.159
Yeah.

16:17.179 --> 16:17.440
Yeah.

16:20.866 --> 16:21.646
He's cute!

16:22.046 --> 16:22.746
Yeah!

16:22.786 --> 16:25.067
So we had poor Cicada, he was dead!

16:25.087 --> 16:26.787
And then we brought him home, okay!

16:27.147 --> 16:28.028
We had a big bug party!

16:28.048 --> 16:29.428
He's well loved!

16:29.528 --> 16:31.048
He is at our sink now.

16:31.088 --> 16:31.528
Yeah.

16:31.789 --> 16:35.850
Every time we go to the sink, we're a bit surprised!

16:36.270 --> 16:36.790
Yeah.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.610
Just because, you know, there might be other buggies.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.691
So it's best to have it by the sink.

16:43.726 --> 16:44.706
Yeah.

16:44.786 --> 16:45.827
Oh, Hikoi's listening.

16:45.947 --> 16:46.788
What?

16:47.209 --> 16:47.489
What?

16:47.549 --> 16:50.211
We had a bug party all together!

16:50.331 --> 16:52.894
And we ate the mixed bugs that Bi-senpai brought.

16:52.934 --> 16:55.056
There was grasshoppers.

16:55.136 --> 16:56.437
And silkworms.

16:56.897 --> 16:59.179
And other stuff.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.722
And a big tarantula!

17:01.742 --> 17:04.024
A big tarantula!

17:04.084 --> 17:04.384
Yeah.

17:04.424 --> 17:09.208
Bi-senpai is officially the first member of hololive to kiss a tarantula.

17:10.741 --> 17:17.705
And then, Hatsuma-senpai and I, we shared the tarantula together!

17:17.745 --> 17:17.866
Yay!

17:17.926 --> 17:19.006
I had some of the legs.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.788
Along with Basen, but we shared a leg.

17:22.028 --> 17:24.149
Yeah, but Hatsuma-senpai, we would have these together.

17:24.249 --> 17:25.550
You're having breakfast!

17:25.770 --> 17:27.371
We're having the tarantula taste!

17:28.012 --> 17:28.952
Ah, it tasted!

17:28.972 --> 17:31.054
It tasted very crunchy.

17:31.074 --> 17:32.935
It tasted a little bit like dust.

17:33.315 --> 17:37.518
But then when you kind of like savor the taste, it tasted like a little bit...

17:39.373 --> 17:40.033
Not great.

17:40.753 --> 17:45.255
A little bit like a seafood taste, but dry.

17:45.275 --> 17:48.296
A little bit of a bitterness, but not really a bitterness.

17:48.576 --> 17:50.777
So don't get scared by the fact that I just said bitter.

17:50.857 --> 17:52.877
The hardest part is the dustiness.

17:53.217 --> 17:53.978
The dustiness.

17:54.038 --> 17:57.739
It was a very hard swallow because I didn't have anything to drink.

17:58.459 --> 17:59.540
It's very dry.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.582
It's like having flour that's gone bad.

18:02.642 --> 18:03.103
Yeah.

18:03.383 --> 18:10.208
It was like when you're trying to have medicine and you're like, oh I don't have anything to drink so you're trying to swallow that.

18:10.809 --> 18:14.232
It was like having five medicines at once.

18:14.832 --> 18:15.873
That's how hard it was.

18:16.553 --> 18:16.954
Yeah.

18:18.159 --> 18:27.189
But, more than anything, I'm happy to say maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm the first member of hololive to share a tarantula with Hatsuma-senpai!

18:27.229 --> 18:28.049
We would have these!

18:28.109 --> 18:29.371
I know Bee-senpai has!

18:29.391 --> 18:30.752
And Moco-chan, you had legs.

18:30.832 --> 18:31.393
I had a leg.

18:31.673 --> 18:33.915
Technically, it was... Wait, so many legs anyways.

18:33.975 --> 18:38.380
Technically, it was an indirect kiss through tarantula with Hatsuma-senpai.

18:39.892 --> 18:41.053
I'm Bae-senpai.

18:41.294 --> 18:41.554
Yeah.

18:41.854 --> 18:42.115
Yeah.

18:42.875 --> 18:45.118
I guess Bae-senpai already kissed the tarantula.

18:45.378 --> 18:47.521
Yeah, on the red part of the tarantula.

18:47.541 --> 18:47.681
Yeah.

18:50.814 --> 18:51.815
Did I have lipstick on?

18:51.855 --> 18:52.415
Is that why?

18:52.435 --> 18:53.156
I don't know.

18:53.176 --> 18:53.937
I don't know.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.538
It was definitely lips though.

18:55.758 --> 18:56.679
It was fuzzy lips.

18:56.779 --> 18:58.080
I didn't want to look close though.

18:58.160 --> 18:58.340
No.

18:58.661 --> 18:59.081
Yeah.

19:00.322 --> 19:02.003
Yeah.

19:02.544 --> 19:04.025
It was... It was weird.

19:04.045 --> 19:06.307
It was fun together.

19:06.327 --> 19:07.388
I tried Vegemite too.

19:07.488 --> 19:08.549
Yeah, Vegemite.

19:08.569 --> 19:10.290
It was just strong tasting.

19:10.330 --> 19:14.574
Yeah, it tasted like miso and black licorice and a bit of factory.

19:14.734 --> 19:14.974
Yeah.

19:15.775 --> 19:16.255
Not a food.

19:16.295 --> 19:16.916
Not a food.

19:16.976 --> 19:17.216
Not a food.

19:17.236 --> 19:17.496
Yeah.

19:17.676 --> 19:17.837
Yeah.

19:18.537 --> 19:18.817
BOMBA!

19:18.897 --> 19:21.539
Good summer memories!

19:22.500 --> 19:26.543
We're about to continue the memories!

19:26.723 --> 19:27.904
FUWAMOCO!

19:27.924 --> 19:31.867
We're going to be playing a very special game!

19:31.887 --> 19:36.230
Aqua Senpai's Visual Novel Aquarium!

19:36.510 --> 19:38.231
And Ruffians!

19:39.112 --> 19:40.513
Plants changed a little bit.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.774
It's an endurance game!

19:43.815 --> 19:46.896
We're playing it to the end!

19:47.036 --> 19:52.399
In case you didn't catch that, we are playing it until the end of the game.

19:52.419 --> 19:55.921
You know FUWAMOCO, we love visual novels.

19:56.421 --> 20:01.165
It's a really big dream of ours to one day release our own FUWAMOCO vision level!

20:01.606 --> 20:06.970
So that's why we thought that, okay, we have to check out Aqua Surprise for the very first time.

20:07.010 --> 20:10.213
And you know, we wanted to play it, but it's only up to chapter 2.

20:10.293 --> 20:17.700
So we asked, we asked Mane-chan, can we get Brahms to play the whole game, please?

20:17.720 --> 20:18.661
A little while back.

20:18.681 --> 20:19.442
And!

20:20.485 --> 20:21.446
I think the rules changed.

20:21.706 --> 20:22.887
The rules changed!

20:22.907 --> 20:23.247
Yeah!

20:23.487 --> 20:26.930
And now, we can play all of Aquarium!

20:26.970 --> 20:29.452
Yeah, it's a bit confusing though, so we will explain.

20:30.413 --> 20:33.296
So, like before, you can only play up to Chapter 2.

20:33.356 --> 20:34.016
Yeah.

20:34.877 --> 20:39.661
And... But we're gonna play up to the very end, so we're gonna play up to Chapter 2 in one stream.

20:39.721 --> 20:40.021
One stream.

20:40.121 --> 20:44.365
And then right after, we're gonna go into another one right into the end.

20:44.505 --> 20:44.765
Yeah.

20:45.105 --> 20:49.489
So the first stream of Chapter 2 will always stay archived.

20:50.670 --> 20:59.918
But then, the remaining chapters up until the end, they can be on our channel up until August 28th, and then... JST.

21:00.298 --> 21:03.781
Unfortunately, the archive has to go private.

21:03.921 --> 21:04.081
Yeah.

21:04.522 --> 21:04.742
But...

21:05.282 --> 21:09.566
We're hoping, Ruffians, that you'll join us there for Aquarium, for all of Aquarium!

21:09.586 --> 21:10.446
The whole game!

21:10.907 --> 21:22.897
And then, maybe if you're not able to, that you'll be able to check it out before it has to go away, so... But, at the very least, we will still have Uptown Chapter 2 even after that will be available, so...

21:23.437 --> 21:25.540
We're really excited though, you know?

21:25.760 --> 21:26.000
Yeah!

21:26.301 --> 21:29.384
I've heard that, you know, of course Aqua-senpai appears.

21:29.444 --> 21:29.845
Of course.

21:29.865 --> 21:40.097
But Marin-senshu-senpai and Fubuki-senpai are there too, so... I don't know, I'm excited to find out what kind of world it is, what kind of things may be happening, what kind of options there are.

21:40.137 --> 21:41.258
The tissues are needed.

21:41.739 --> 21:42.800
Tissues are...

21:44.315 --> 21:45.096
I'll fight for it.

21:45.616 --> 21:47.798
When though?

21:47.878 --> 21:49.219
Very soon!

21:49.259 --> 21:50.200
Very soon!

21:50.320 --> 21:51.621
This weekend!

21:51.641 --> 21:52.341
On Sunday!

21:52.361 --> 21:54.363
Please be there, Ruffians!

21:54.383 --> 21:56.665
Yeah, very okay!

21:56.685 --> 21:58.346
Do you have perms for your heart?

21:58.446 --> 21:58.786
Why?

21:59.427 --> 22:00.187
I don't know!

22:00.207 --> 22:02.149
We'll have to ask Marnie-chan, huh?

22:02.189 --> 22:02.329
Yeah.

22:04.350 --> 22:07.231
Wow, a mining route is quite something.

22:07.251 --> 22:10.052
I didn't know Senchou-senpai has a route.

22:10.392 --> 22:11.772
It's Aqua-senpai's game.

22:11.812 --> 22:14.413
We have to go for Aqua-senpai, right?

22:14.713 --> 22:15.293
Yeah.

22:16.893 --> 22:19.874
But let's enjoy it all together, okay?

22:20.134 --> 22:22.534
BAU BAU!

22:23.575 --> 22:24.455
BAU BAU!

22:24.575 --> 22:27.496
Recently, we've been doing a bunch of different things.

22:27.516 --> 22:28.236
We just finished...

22:28.916 --> 22:32.905
We closed up Cafe FUWAMOCO, our main cafe!

22:33.025 --> 22:33.727
You know!

22:33.747 --> 22:34.890
You know, right now!

22:36.025 --> 22:36.785
Holosummer.

22:36.846 --> 22:39.987
A nice omniscient holosummer bingo!

22:40.348 --> 22:44.110
So that's why we've been doing some funny stuff recently.

22:44.210 --> 22:45.291
Like eating bugs!

22:45.331 --> 22:46.211
Like eating bugs!

22:46.251 --> 22:47.572
That's not something normal for us.

22:47.612 --> 22:49.013
That's the first time we've done that.

22:49.033 --> 22:50.934
We just ate a lot of bugs in one day.

22:50.954 --> 22:56.658
So let's take a look at the bingo sheet!

22:56.978 --> 23:01.881
Our bingo sheet is OK Ruffians and we updated it together with you!

23:06.039 --> 23:06.839
Which one was that?

23:06.879 --> 23:07.840
That was really fast, Moco-chan.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.282
One second, one second, one second!

23:09.302 --> 23:11.283
Do the Ruffians agree with that?

23:11.524 --> 23:12.505
Okay, first one.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.566
Bento.

23:15.127 --> 23:15.728
Bento, okay.

23:16.528 --> 23:17.149
Bento.

23:17.649 --> 23:17.929
So!

23:18.750 --> 23:20.051
We haven't had a bento yet.

23:20.131 --> 23:21.492
We haven't had a bento yet.

23:22.093 --> 23:25.095
We have to get a bento and maybe get given a bento.

23:25.656 --> 23:26.516
Hasn't happened yet.

23:26.576 --> 23:27.217
No bento.

23:27.277 --> 23:28.018
No bento yet.

23:28.058 --> 23:28.978
We can make a bento.

23:29.239 --> 23:29.719
Play a sport!

23:29.859 --> 23:30.680
Play a sport!

23:31.220 --> 23:32.301
Pro wrestling!

23:32.341 --> 23:34.583
Pro wrestling counts as sports, right?

23:34.623 --> 23:34.963
Yes!

23:35.744 --> 23:36.304
Right!

23:36.485 --> 23:36.865
Clear!

23:36.885 --> 23:38.126
Right.

23:38.146 --> 23:38.406
Yes.

23:38.586 --> 23:39.127
That's a sport.

23:39.547 --> 23:39.787
Yes.

23:40.028 --> 23:40.468
Right.

23:41.008 --> 23:42.650
Summer test of courage.

23:44.231 --> 23:45.272
We have...

23:46.559 --> 23:47.900
The bugs kinda like that.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.441
Tomorrow?

23:49.402 --> 23:50.463
Hajime-senpai!

23:50.884 --> 23:51.684
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

23:51.704 --> 23:52.966
Tomorrow, tomorrow, after tomorrow.

23:53.006 --> 23:53.246
Yes.

23:53.646 --> 23:53.867
Yes.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.649
Maybe, but not yet!

23:55.669 --> 23:57.310
It's still too early, right?

23:57.350 --> 23:57.611
Yeah.

23:57.911 --> 23:59.252
We can't mark it off until it happens.

23:59.553 --> 23:59.813
Yeah.

24:00.614 --> 24:00.914
Yeah.

24:01.735 --> 24:03.437
But, once it's done, it'll be done.

24:03.457 --> 24:05.719
Learn a new skill!

24:06.340 --> 24:07.121
For wrestling!

24:08.415 --> 24:10.375
We worked really hard to learn something new!

24:10.395 --> 24:11.115
That's a skill!

24:11.776 --> 24:12.996
We worked really hard!

24:13.096 --> 24:14.216
It counts, right?

24:15.036 --> 24:16.456
Wrestling's a new skill!

24:16.496 --> 24:16.777
Yeah!

24:17.237 --> 24:18.877
Write a poetic verse!

24:20.617 --> 24:21.497
We haven't done that yet.

24:21.657 --> 24:23.918
Can we write a poetic verse all together, Ruffians?

24:23.978 --> 24:24.958
Poetic verse!

24:24.978 --> 24:26.178
A haiku!

24:26.318 --> 24:26.898
Haiku?

24:26.958 --> 24:27.618
Haiku!

24:27.658 --> 24:35.860
The rule for haiku is... Okay, three lines, five syllables in the first, seven in the second, and five in the third.

24:38.729 --> 24:40.510
FUWAMOCO is four.

24:41.331 --> 24:42.792
No, is that how it works?

24:42.812 --> 24:44.192
Yeah, that's how it works!

24:44.312 --> 24:46.454
It's five words, seven words, and five words.

24:46.474 --> 24:46.794
No, syllables!

24:46.894 --> 24:47.354
In English!

24:47.414 --> 24:48.095
In English!

24:48.995 --> 24:50.576
I'm doing it by syllables.

24:50.696 --> 24:53.138
Can't do anything in English like that!

24:53.518 --> 24:53.958
Really?

24:53.978 --> 24:54.018
No!

24:54.038 --> 24:55.900
Five words?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.061
Five words.

24:58.241 --> 24:59.582
That's a lot of words.

25:00.636 --> 25:00.996
No, it's syllables!

25:01.016 --> 25:01.076
Huh?

25:01.097 --> 25:01.697
It's syllables in English too.

25:01.717 --> 25:02.117
Syllables is correct.

25:02.158 --> 25:02.458
Yeah, thank you.

Syllables is correct.

25:10.345 --> 25:10.625
Yeah, thank you.

25:10.645 --> 25:11.066
Syllables is correct.

25:11.086 --> 25:11.406
Yeah, thank you.

25:11.426 --> 25:11.827
Syllables is correct.

25:11.847 --> 25:12.127
Yeah, thank you.

25:12.147 --> 25:12.607
Syllables is correct.

25:12.627 --> 25:13.008
Yeah, thank you.

25:13.028 --> 25:13.468
Syllables is correct.

25:13.488 --> 25:13.788
Yeah, thank you.

25:13.808 --> 25:14.209
Syllables is correct.

25:14.229 --> 25:16.051

25:16.071 --> 25:16.491
Syllables is correct.

25:19.694 --> 25:20.094
Syllables is correct.

25:20.114 --> 25:20.395
Yeah, thank you.

25:22.911 --> 25:27.054
I wanna write something meaningful about the summer we spent together, Ruffians.

25:27.354 --> 25:28.174
So not bugs.

25:28.755 --> 25:29.695
Not meaningful.

25:30.476 --> 25:31.076
Ponderings?

25:31.176 --> 25:32.397
Okay, ponderings!

25:32.757 --> 25:34.138
Ponderings.

25:36.019 --> 25:37.040
And bugs.

25:37.500 --> 25:37.841
No!

25:38.461 --> 25:38.681
No!

25:38.701 --> 25:38.841
Uh...

25:41.093 --> 25:43.695
A donut with you.

25:43.895 --> 25:45.176
Okay, that's the first one.

25:45.556 --> 25:46.497
That's five syllables.

25:46.597 --> 25:47.377
A donut with you.

25:47.397 --> 25:48.898
Sometimes bugs.

25:49.218 --> 25:49.579
No!

25:49.599 --> 25:52.020
It's for the memories.

25:52.861 --> 25:53.201
Seven.

25:55.142 --> 25:56.423
Write it down, Moco-chan.

25:56.483 --> 25:57.083
Write it down.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.004
A donut with you.

25:58.044 --> 25:58.885
What was your line?

25:59.245 --> 26:02.207
Sometimes bugs, but it's for the memories.

26:03.988 --> 26:04.608
A donut.

26:04.828 --> 26:05.349
A donut.

26:05.909 --> 26:06.530
A donut.

26:06.550 --> 26:07.110
With you.

26:07.370 --> 26:08.591
With you is up.

26:09.407 --> 26:11.689
One, two, a doughnut with you.

26:11.709 --> 26:12.209
Five.

26:13.710 --> 26:14.710
Sometimes.

26:15.211 --> 26:17.492
Sometimes with.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.473
Sometimes bugs.

26:19.253 --> 26:19.653
Three?

26:19.934 --> 26:20.154
But.

26:20.934 --> 26:21.475
Four?

26:21.615 --> 26:22.775
But it's.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.036
Five.

26:24.516 --> 26:25.837
Six memories.

26:25.897 --> 26:26.538
That's more.

26:26.698 --> 26:26.818
One.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.279
Sometimes with.

26:28.939 --> 26:30.020
Sometimes bugs.

26:30.200 --> 26:30.760
But it's.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.982
Four memories.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.102
That's nine.

26:34.743 --> 26:34.803
Ow.

26:36.831 --> 26:38.051
Sometimes bugs!

26:38.611 --> 26:40.452
Sometimes bugs to me!

26:40.472 --> 26:43.193
How ya, Moco-chan?

26:43.213 --> 26:44.833
Okay, I'm gonna erase it.

26:45.133 --> 26:45.813
What?!

26:45.853 --> 26:47.614
Ruffians, what about your ideas?

26:47.734 --> 26:48.814
A donut with you.

26:48.834 --> 26:51.735
A donut with you.

26:51.755 --> 27:01.598
Looking over Akihabara.

27:01.658 --> 27:02.158
That's nice.

27:04.380 --> 27:09.185
Looking over Akiba.

27:09.805 --> 27:12.148
Yeah, that's seven.

27:12.408 --> 27:14.070
Looking over Akiba.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.252
Over Akiba.

27:16.752 --> 27:17.633
We wrestle.

27:18.534 --> 27:19.075
Wrestling.

27:19.415 --> 27:24.860
Res-res-wrestling demon dogs.

27:25.581 --> 27:25.921
Yeah.

27:26.282 --> 27:26.942
Wrestling.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.275
Demon dogs.

27:29.435 --> 27:29.775
Yeah.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.476
Does that work?

27:30.676 --> 27:31.697
A donut with you.

27:32.197 --> 27:33.819
Looking over Akihabara.

27:34.259 --> 27:35.680
Wrestling demon dogs.

27:36.401 --> 27:36.681
Huh?

27:37.261 --> 27:38.542
I think that's pretty good!

27:38.562 --> 27:39.023
Good poem!

27:40.003 --> 27:40.244
Right?

27:40.304 --> 27:40.684
Yeah.

27:40.704 --> 27:41.885
Yeah.

27:43.046 --> 27:43.566
Okay!

27:43.586 --> 27:44.807
Wrestling is three syllables!

27:44.927 --> 27:45.548
Wrestling!

27:45.568 --> 27:45.628
Two!

27:45.868 --> 27:46.589
Wrestling!

27:47.009 --> 27:47.709
Wrestling?

27:47.970 --> 27:48.650
Wrestling, no.

27:48.670 --> 27:49.711
No, wrestling.

27:49.731 --> 27:50.452
Yeah.

27:50.512 --> 27:50.752
Yeah.

27:51.614 --> 27:52.835
Open!

27:52.855 --> 27:53.435
Done!

27:53.455 --> 27:55.856
Okay, play a retro game.

27:56.516 --> 28:00.438
Unfortunately, Sakura Boys is a wrestling game.

28:01.858 --> 28:02.778
A retro game.

28:02.878 --> 28:03.659
Retro game!

28:04.079 --> 28:04.919
Yeah.

28:05.299 --> 28:07.040
Talk about some of the memories we did today!

28:07.060 --> 28:09.061
That was FUWAMOCO Morning!

28:09.421 --> 28:13.543
You know what the Popsicles conducted an experiment?

28:13.743 --> 28:13.823
No.

28:15.285 --> 28:16.226
Organize an event.

28:16.266 --> 28:20.168
We organized an off-club karaoke with biboo!

28:20.289 --> 28:22.890
That counts, right, Ruffians?

28:22.910 --> 28:25.112
That's a lot of preparation.

28:25.152 --> 28:26.033
Totsumachi too!

28:26.073 --> 28:28.254
Let me have a totsumachi!

28:28.995 --> 28:32.177
Eat something you've never tried before.

28:33.623 --> 28:34.123
Done!

28:35.064 --> 28:35.904
Tarantula.

28:36.284 --> 28:36.585
Inaugural.

28:36.685 --> 28:37.385
Vegemite.

28:38.145 --> 28:38.986
Yeah, lots of them.

28:39.006 --> 28:40.406
We're trying lots of things all the time.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.027
Lots of new.

28:41.467 --> 28:41.847
Yeah.

28:41.887 --> 28:42.267
Yeah.

28:42.908 --> 28:43.348
Okay.

28:43.928 --> 28:46.149
Conducted investigation.

28:46.169 --> 28:47.790
Not yet, no.

28:48.331 --> 28:51.252
Back again, memorize all 47 perfections.

28:51.592 --> 28:52.133
Done!

28:52.153 --> 28:55.094
Moco-chan, do you remember where Fukuoka is?

28:56.595 --> 28:56.755
Yes.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.779
BAU BAU!

29:00.839 --> 29:01.219
Next!

29:02.139 --> 29:02.980
Oh, free space!

29:03.020 --> 29:04.020
Your summer goals!

29:04.440 --> 29:05.540
We have too many!

29:05.620 --> 29:06.901
Summer is almost over!

29:06.921 --> 29:11.503
Our last summer goal... Is to break the dimension!

29:11.523 --> 29:12.403
Yeah!

29:12.423 --> 29:13.303
It's gonna be done.

29:13.883 --> 29:15.024
BAU BAU!

29:15.224 --> 29:16.504
Watch a movie!

29:16.884 --> 29:17.325
DONE!

29:17.365 --> 29:18.065
We watched...

29:20.739 --> 29:21.339
What do you want?

29:21.379 --> 29:23.101
Princess Bride!

29:23.821 --> 29:25.503
The memory is not good recently.

29:26.664 --> 29:27.945
BAU BAU!

29:28.345 --> 29:29.546
Start a picture diary.

29:30.527 --> 29:31.488
Haven't done that yet.

29:31.768 --> 29:32.389
We have to do one.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.731
No bingo yet, Ruffians!

29:35.392 --> 29:37.974
Do a leisure activity!

29:37.994 --> 29:41.197
There must be something.

29:45.908 --> 29:46.288
Not yet.

29:46.888 --> 29:47.288
Not yet.

29:47.508 --> 29:47.949
Soon.

29:49.089 --> 29:49.489
Soon.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.650
Catch insects or fish!

29:52.690 --> 29:53.550
We got our friend!

29:53.710 --> 29:54.090
Yeah!

29:54.150 --> 29:55.411
We caught our friend!

29:55.451 --> 29:56.591
The cicada!

29:57.111 --> 29:59.792
It has to be within August of August.

30:00.172 --> 30:02.593
We went to the onsen earlier.

30:02.693 --> 30:05.233
It has to be during the same time period.

30:05.633 --> 30:06.934
Yeah.

30:06.994 --> 30:08.854
Dualism activity!

30:08.874 --> 30:10.775
That was tricky.

30:13.471 --> 30:14.111
Hi.

30:14.231 --> 30:17.434
Okay, cheat your parents!

30:17.554 --> 30:20.036
Mama puppy, papa puppy!

30:20.876 --> 30:22.658
Mama!

30:23.198 --> 30:23.638
Later.

30:24.839 --> 30:25.720
Have a collab!

30:26.440 --> 30:26.761
Yes!

30:26.841 --> 30:26.981
Done.

30:27.802 --> 30:28.162
Done.

30:28.222 --> 30:29.203
Many a collab.

30:29.223 --> 30:29.263
On.

30:29.483 --> 30:31.384
Fan service!

30:32.665 --> 30:32.705
On!

30:32.725 --> 30:32.985
Ruffians!

30:33.106 --> 30:38.470
Does our 3D debut count or do we have to... pull something silly?

30:40.224 --> 30:41.525
What does that mean?

30:41.965 --> 30:42.485
Yeah, done!

30:42.545 --> 30:43.265
Okay, I saw it, done!

30:43.665 --> 30:44.426
It's done!

30:44.886 --> 30:46.446
BAU BAU!

30:46.586 --> 30:46.686
Done?

30:47.167 --> 30:47.527
Yeah.

30:47.647 --> 30:48.267
Okay!

30:48.867 --> 30:49.948
The shima-shima sword.

30:49.968 --> 30:51.528
Wait, we have to pour something.

30:51.548 --> 30:56.430
Pour something.

30:58.171 --> 30:58.711
Do it now!

30:58.851 --> 30:59.291
Do it now!

30:59.351 --> 31:01.412
I can't do anything like that now!

31:01.452 --> 31:02.752
Maybe later, okay?

31:02.772 --> 31:04.373
We won't make it off yet.

31:05.012 --> 31:05.813
BAU BAU.

31:06.293 --> 31:07.934
Sing a summery song.

31:08.014 --> 31:13.357
We sing Sora era days, but if it was Natsu era days, then maybe, but not.

31:13.397 --> 31:14.618
Maybe soon though?

31:14.638 --> 31:15.278
Maybe.

31:16.339 --> 31:17.480
Confess your sins.

31:18.761 --> 31:21.582
Oh, is there a sin to confess?

31:21.682 --> 31:22.603
I have nothing.

31:24.564 --> 31:25.345
Maybe that's a sin.

31:26.021 --> 31:26.601
What?

31:27.122 --> 31:28.543
No sense to confess.

31:28.863 --> 31:30.684
We'll figure it out later.

31:30.744 --> 31:31.565
Write a letter!

31:31.585 --> 31:32.125
Come on!

31:32.185 --> 31:32.846
As many!

31:32.986 --> 31:34.507
Excuse me!

31:34.847 --> 31:36.048
Write a letter!

31:36.468 --> 31:36.748
Done.

31:37.088 --> 31:37.469
Done.

31:37.489 --> 31:38.689
We wrote a thank you letter.

31:38.709 --> 31:39.490
A thank you letter.

31:39.510 --> 31:39.790
Yes.

31:40.411 --> 31:42.232
You know... The 3D team.

31:42.252 --> 31:48.016
Yeah, all the staff who... Who helped with the... I think it ended up being four pages long!

31:49.356 --> 31:52.919
Yeah... All in Japanese by hand.

31:52.939 --> 31:53.779
It took a while!

31:53.799 --> 31:54.300
Yeah.

31:56.002 --> 31:57.063
And in 3D, yes!

31:57.764 --> 31:58.124
Yes!

31:58.905 --> 31:59.826
Lots of letters.

31:59.967 --> 32:02.830
And for Aqua-senpai too, yes!

32:02.850 --> 32:04.052
Aqua-senpai too!

32:04.092 --> 32:05.153
We're always writing letters.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.976
We're always writing letters.

32:07.016 --> 32:09.219
That's the best way to be able to express yourself.

32:09.239 --> 32:10.520
Other than singing.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.141
Give a gift!

32:14.899 --> 32:15.039
Oh!

32:15.059 --> 32:18.080
We gave a gift to Biboo!

32:18.801 --> 32:21.022
And to Mari-chan too!

32:21.322 --> 32:24.464
And to the FW team too!

32:25.184 --> 32:26.585
Find or show a treasure.

32:26.985 --> 32:28.206
We have the treasure.

32:28.826 --> 32:30.187
We haven't shown it.

32:30.207 --> 32:31.028
We found it!

32:31.328 --> 32:31.908
We found it.

32:32.148 --> 32:33.189
We haven't shown it.

32:33.249 --> 32:35.190
You probably want to see it, right Ruffians?

32:35.390 --> 32:36.711
Are we allowed to show it?

32:37.531 --> 32:38.632
We'll have to ask Mari-chan.

32:40.862 --> 32:41.362
Bingo bingo!

32:41.382 --> 32:41.583
Yeah!

32:41.703 --> 32:42.443
I got a bingo!

32:42.503 --> 32:44.405
Yeah!

32:44.465 --> 32:46.267
Buffa!

32:46.747 --> 32:49.249
Yeah, but... Can we mark off the treasure?

32:49.289 --> 32:50.590
We have to ask.

32:50.610 --> 32:51.251
We found it.

32:51.371 --> 32:52.392
Okay, we can mark it off.

32:52.432 --> 32:54.013
We found it, but we have to show it.

32:54.193 --> 32:54.473
Okay.

32:54.774 --> 32:55.995
Otherwise it's not that fun.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.257
Oh yeah, Ruffians, we found the treasure.

32:58.617 --> 33:00.238
You're not gonna see it, cause it's my treasure.

33:00.258 --> 33:00.378
Yeah.

33:01.621 --> 33:01.861
Look!

33:02.001 --> 33:03.842
It's coming along, right?

33:03.942 --> 33:04.622
It's coming along!

33:04.662 --> 33:05.303
Pretty good?

33:05.323 --> 33:07.364
Bye bye!

33:07.944 --> 33:08.524
Okay.

33:08.884 --> 33:10.325
But there's also... Huh?

33:13.947 --> 33:15.248
There's... Inferno.

33:15.708 --> 33:18.109
Inferno Bingo, right?

33:18.129 --> 33:22.651
Can we take a look at the Inferno Bingo Mopa Team?

33:22.671 --> 33:24.912
Okay!

33:24.972 --> 33:28.134
Let's take a look.

33:28.154 --> 33:28.594
Okay!

33:29.805 --> 33:30.365
Inferno!

33:30.385 --> 33:30.926
Yeah!

33:31.126 --> 33:32.127
Inferno!

33:32.187 --> 33:32.547
Bingo!

33:33.588 --> 33:33.848
Okay.

33:34.589 --> 33:35.329
Let's take a look.

33:35.349 --> 33:37.371
What have we done so far here?

33:38.371 --> 33:38.932
Ah, well!

33:39.312 --> 33:41.214
Dual waiting for a call stream with a set theme.

33:42.374 --> 33:43.916
Daimei Cafe Totsubuchi!

33:43.956 --> 33:44.416
Bye bye!

33:44.476 --> 33:45.177
Bye bye!

33:45.337 --> 33:47.638
That was a set theme.

33:48.139 --> 33:50.761
Send a long message of love to a hololive member.

33:51.101 --> 33:51.521
Easy!

33:51.742 --> 33:52.502
Not done yet.

33:52.542 --> 33:52.702
No.

33:52.982 --> 33:53.243
Yeah.

33:53.603 --> 33:55.084
Create a new unit.

33:55.124 --> 33:56.025
A new unit!

33:57.200 --> 33:58.321
Well done!

33:58.361 --> 33:58.581
Wow!

33:58.681 --> 33:59.862
Akuazu FUWAMOCO!

33:59.882 --> 34:01.083
Yeah!

34:01.283 --> 34:01.363
Oh!

34:01.383 --> 34:03.344
Akuazu FUWAMOCO does that count?

34:03.384 --> 34:03.664
Yes!

34:04.205 --> 34:04.305
Yes!

34:04.345 --> 34:05.145
Yeah!

34:06.026 --> 34:06.346
Why?

34:06.406 --> 34:07.387
It doesn't let it.

34:07.607 --> 34:08.848
Aqua-senpai count.

34:09.828 --> 34:11.530
The letter, yeah.

34:11.630 --> 34:12.090
It's a 1.

34:13.151 --> 34:13.691
It counts!

34:14.031 --> 34:14.452
Does it count?

34:15.232 --> 34:15.953
It counts!

34:16.313 --> 34:17.353
Okay!

34:18.134 --> 34:19.535
Wow, successfully... Oh!

34:20.095 --> 34:20.616
Bingo!

34:20.776 --> 34:21.276
Oh, that counts!

34:21.596 --> 34:22.257
That counts!

34:22.597 --> 34:23.658
It counts, it counts, it counts.

34:28.517 --> 34:30.179
I don't know if it's that long though.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.301
I don't think it was very long at all.

34:32.321 --> 34:33.221
Was it long enough?

34:33.482 --> 34:35.323
That was a regular level.

34:35.383 --> 34:37.826
I feel like it was regular, it wasn't that long.

34:37.846 --> 34:39.107
Right!

34:39.127 --> 34:42.370
Do we want to count it as yes or no?

34:42.390 --> 34:46.874
It was long.

34:48.156 --> 34:49.277
Don't count it then!

34:49.997 --> 34:50.638
Longer now!

34:50.658 --> 34:52.359
Okay, okay, it counts.

34:52.519 --> 34:52.820
Okay.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.641
BAU BAU!

34:54.801 --> 34:55.061
Next!

34:55.462 --> 34:57.163
Successfully pull off a prank.

34:57.183 --> 34:58.904
Biboo was screaming quite a bit.

34:59.004 --> 35:00.666
I would say that that was pretty successful.

35:00.686 --> 35:01.426
Pretty successful, right?

35:01.446 --> 35:01.666
Yes.

35:02.387 --> 35:04.689
Yeah, decide for yourself.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.189
Next one.

35:07.531 --> 35:11.314
Eat a tarantula.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.050
Well, there's also... I think that's pretty good for eating insects.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.531
I'll try eating insects, I guess.

35:16.571 --> 35:17.051
Yeah.

35:17.512 --> 35:18.873
Well, let's mark that one clear.

35:20.154 --> 35:21.755
We ate a bunch of insects.

35:21.795 --> 35:23.616
It says try, it doesn't say eat!

35:23.936 --> 35:24.897
I thought it said eat!

35:24.917 --> 35:26.178
I thought it said eat too!

35:28.280 --> 35:29.701
It has to be at least attempt!

35:30.361 --> 35:32.863
You have to attempt it!

35:32.883 --> 35:32.943
Wow!

35:34.184 --> 35:36.786
Wait, what?

35:38.068 --> 35:39.890
Well, try is good enough.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.831
We thought it wasn't.

35:42.912 --> 35:45.253
What should the free space be like for you?

35:45.413 --> 35:46.574
Yeah, the free space.

35:48.796 --> 35:50.317
Sing a new song!

35:50.457 --> 35:51.237
That's a good one.

35:51.398 --> 35:51.718
Yeah.

35:51.738 --> 35:52.038
Okay.

35:52.238 --> 35:52.618
Done!

35:53.079 --> 35:53.359
Done?

35:53.659 --> 35:54.620
Yeah, we do it with Biboo.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.341
Oh, that's cute!

35:56.361 --> 35:57.182
A bunch of new songs.

35:57.202 --> 35:58.262
A bunch of new songs.

35:58.362 --> 35:58.743
Done!

35:59.003 --> 35:59.723
Okay!

36:00.064 --> 36:02.385
Club with members I don't usually interact with.

36:02.926 --> 36:03.366
Done!

36:03.486 --> 36:04.006
Yeah!

36:04.607 --> 36:04.787
Yeah!

36:06.868 --> 36:10.109
Ah, that was the first time!

36:10.169 --> 36:11.370
Bye bye!

36:11.510 --> 36:13.411
Yeah!

36:13.951 --> 36:17.612
But do a stream of impersonating other hololive members.

36:17.852 --> 36:18.453
Not done yet.

36:18.613 --> 36:20.193
It has to be the whole stream?

36:21.794 --> 36:22.494
Haven't done that.

36:22.714 --> 36:22.894
No.

36:22.954 --> 36:24.915
I just met Fuwawa this whole time.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.276
And make Italian food.

36:28.156 --> 36:28.617
Eat bugs?

36:28.697 --> 36:29.017
Yes!

36:29.577 --> 36:30.477
Make Italian food?

36:30.537 --> 36:30.877
No!

36:31.078 --> 36:31.538
No!

36:33.007 --> 36:33.487
Okay!

36:33.827 --> 36:34.587
Yeah!

36:35.348 --> 36:36.468
Make a pizza!

36:36.488 --> 36:38.008
A pizza?

36:38.088 --> 36:39.409
I don't want to make a pizza.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.609
How do you make a pizza?

36:41.869 --> 36:43.449
Wouldn't pasta be easier?

36:43.469 --> 36:48.631
You just, you know, put the pasta in the water.

36:50.191 --> 36:52.972
And then you just put some oil or something on it.

36:53.112 --> 36:54.232
Yeah.

36:54.252 --> 36:55.732
Pasta!

36:59.370 --> 36:59.930
We'll see.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.291
It's all Italian food though.

37:01.351 --> 37:01.771
I don't know.

37:01.791 --> 37:02.772
It doesn't say make pasta.

37:02.812 --> 37:04.433
It says make Italian food.

37:04.553 --> 37:06.594
Pasta is Italian food.

37:06.634 --> 37:06.955
BAU BAU!

37:06.995 --> 37:12.298
Look at all the bingos!

37:12.358 --> 37:13.899
Chupo bingo!

37:13.959 --> 37:15.080
I couldn't do the Inferno!

37:15.100 --> 37:20.143
It almost there maybe to complete all of the whole summer bingo!

37:20.523 --> 37:21.984
Please share for us!

37:22.024 --> 37:23.885
We'll post them on Twitter later too!

37:23.905 --> 37:25.846
I couldn't progress.

37:26.026 --> 37:26.987
I couldn't progress.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.222
BAU BAU!

37:31.922 --> 37:32.883
Wow!

37:33.403 --> 37:34.304
Moco-chan!

37:34.344 --> 37:34.904
Yeah!

37:35.204 --> 37:37.786
Shall we see who the Doggie of the Day is today?

37:37.886 --> 37:38.566
Not yet!

37:39.407 --> 37:40.727
Okay, let's go to the Doggie of the Day then.

37:40.847 --> 37:41.928
Okay!

37:42.048 --> 37:45.090
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

37:49.400 --> 37:52.443
She looks so comfy!

37:52.823 --> 37:56.165
Maybe that's because of Icomochi-mama's howl there!

37:56.345 --> 37:58.327
Yeah, comfy!

37:58.367 --> 37:58.667
Hot!

37:58.747 --> 38:03.811
I'm so happy that she started to take a liking to us!

38:03.891 --> 38:05.032
Yes!

38:05.552 --> 38:07.934
Are we gonna be Maple's number one VTuber?

38:08.014 --> 38:08.535
Hot!

38:08.615 --> 38:09.255
Oh, she is!

38:09.355 --> 38:10.356
Yeah!

38:10.796 --> 38:11.077
BAU BAU!

38:11.117 --> 38:15.920
Maybe we need a bit of a tummy rub that's here.

38:15.940 --> 38:16.000
Hot?

38:17.385 --> 38:17.966
Wee wee wee.

38:18.548 --> 38:19.289
BAU BAU!

38:19.349 --> 38:20.391
BAU BAU!

38:20.411 --> 38:20.491
Hi!

38:20.511 --> 38:22.335
That's all of Bau BAU!

38:23.577 --> 38:24.118
BAU BAU!

38:25.176 --> 38:26.197
BAU BAU!

38:26.217 --> 38:27.858
BAU BAU!

38:27.878 --> 38:30.681
Sort of like that.

38:30.841 --> 38:31.902
Oh, it's pretty fuzzy.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.204
That sounds pretty fuzzy to me too.

38:35.265 --> 38:36.546
Olive!

38:36.626 --> 38:37.406
Maple!

38:38.167 --> 38:38.648
Olive!

38:38.988 --> 38:39.648
Olive!

38:39.748 --> 38:41.150
BAU BAU!

38:41.330 --> 38:43.171
BAU BAU!

38:43.352 --> 38:44.913
BAU MAPLE!

38:45.013 --> 38:46.434
It's pretty fuzzy.

38:46.875 --> 38:50.197
But, I think looking at this photo here,

38:51.817 --> 38:55.959
Maybe... Maybe she's a fuwawa oshi.

38:58.781 --> 39:01.222
BAU BAU!

39:02.423 --> 39:03.504
Whenever Moco goes!

39:03.564 --> 39:05.685
Good luck Moco-chan!

39:05.765 --> 39:07.266
Am I just ignored?

39:08.287 --> 39:14.830
Well, please protect your Ruffian lots and lots, and we'll do our best as a team of three all together, okay?

39:14.890 --> 39:15.511
BAU BAU!

39:17.538 --> 39:21.040
And, "Today I went on a walk".

39:22.060 --> 39:22.921
Let's take a look!

39:23.301 --> 39:23.901
Yeah!

39:24.441 --> 39:29.023
We have... De-den!

39:29.324 --> 39:31.244
Is that... the aurora?

39:31.324 --> 39:32.705
FUWAMOCO!

39:32.785 --> 39:34.266
FUWAMA!

39:34.466 --> 39:36.847
How do you go on a walk and spot that?

39:36.947 --> 39:37.667
Right!

39:37.968 --> 39:40.369
Where do you go on a walk?

39:42.321 --> 39:43.802
Can we go along with you?

39:43.822 --> 39:44.043
Yeah!

39:44.063 --> 39:46.805
I wanna see the... Sugoi ne!

39:47.105 --> 39:48.186
Sugoi!

39:48.306 --> 39:49.127
Amazing!

39:49.327 --> 39:52.070
Yeah, it's just a casual walk, you know.

39:52.210 --> 39:56.053
I feel like the longer you look at it, the crazier it looks.

39:56.634 --> 39:56.894
Right?

39:56.934 --> 40:00.197
Like maybe Pero could just come out and fly across it.

40:00.417 --> 40:01.658
That would be disappointing.

40:01.738 --> 40:05.341
Although it kind of would be cool if Pero would be all in the colors.

40:05.481 --> 40:05.842
Yeah.

40:06.702 --> 40:07.182
Gamer Pero!

40:07.242 --> 40:09.183
Gamer Pero!

40:09.203 --> 40:13.664
I'm glad you had an amazing walk by the end of the day.

40:13.884 --> 40:15.164
Once in a lifetime, maybe.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.485
Or maybe just another day.

40:16.525 --> 40:18.065
Maybe just another day, yeah.

40:18.745 --> 40:21.086
BAU BAU!

40:21.106 --> 40:24.346
Moco-chan, did we receive a question?

40:24.366 --> 40:29.048
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

40:29.088 --> 40:31.688
Hi FUWAMOCO!

40:31.748 --> 40:33.909
Not much longer until Breaking Dimensions.

40:34.569 --> 40:36.893
I'm so excited to see you on stage!

40:37.594 --> 40:42.942
Do you have special memories that stand out to you of going to idol concerts?

40:43.463 --> 40:44.925
We have lots of memories!

40:44.945 --> 40:50.133
But you know, instead of going to a concert of a group we're not too familiar with, but then, you know...

40:50.393 --> 40:56.239
Being pulled all into the excitement and fun with the fans and dancing together in the performance!

40:56.259 --> 40:57.740
Natsuru stuff is so much fun!

40:57.780 --> 41:01.163
You never know what you're going to expect but all of a sudden you're just like... Expect?

41:01.583 --> 41:02.925
You never know what you're going to expect.

41:03.585 --> 41:04.766
What you're going to experience.

41:06.188 --> 41:06.348
Yeah.

41:08.455 --> 41:08.975
Yeah!

41:09.635 --> 41:13.197
But then, it's just fun and you're like, okay!

41:13.317 --> 41:16.257
I'm just in together with everybody even though I'm a newbie.

41:16.298 --> 41:17.478
It's so much fun.

41:17.518 --> 41:20.719
You know having that sort of bond there at the moment.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.860
You have to be one together.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.900
Yeah.

41:25.140 --> 41:33.583
But we really hope that more fans at Breaking Dimensions will have a ton of fun and maybe, you know,

41:35.167 --> 41:37.569
Decide to jump together and dance with the Ruffians.

41:37.629 --> 41:40.211
Maybe you can meet up beforehand too!

41:40.311 --> 41:40.731
Have fun!

41:40.831 --> 41:41.551
Yeah!

41:41.571 --> 41:41.652
Yeah!

41:41.912 --> 41:53.800
Before FUWAMOCO will be watching to see just how excited you are before the performance from backstage, so... Please cheer for us a little bit more so we don't have to cry, okay?

41:54.000 --> 41:54.280
Yeah!

41:54.320 --> 41:55.561
Bye bye!

41:55.681 --> 41:57.743
Bye bye!

41:57.803 --> 41:59.724
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

41:59.784 --> 42:03.406
Please send us more doggies with your questions!

42:04.433 --> 42:04.994
Your walks?

42:05.254 --> 42:06.576
There's been a little less walks.

42:06.636 --> 42:08.738
Maybe it's because it's so hot outside.

42:08.918 --> 42:09.779
It makes sense.

42:10.180 --> 42:13.244
But you know, maybe you go out to get something to eat.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.325
Some ice cream.

42:14.705 --> 42:15.907
And you see a butterfly!

42:16.027 --> 42:16.568
Let us know!

42:16.608 --> 42:19.271
I wanna know how your day is going!

42:19.491 --> 42:22.354
And if you happen to see Perochi, let us know, I guess.

42:22.415 --> 42:23.236
BAU BAU!

42:25.218 --> 42:32.647
Well, our next stream is not exactly our next stream, but we have them!

42:32.827 --> 42:37.372
Our Advent 3D Club is happening this weekend!

42:37.432 --> 42:41.957
Yeah, we have it on Saturday at 8pm PT!

42:42.018 --> 42:43.679
What are we gonna be doing?

42:44.260 --> 42:45.080
What do you think?

42:45.320 --> 42:46.421
What do you think, Ruffians?

42:46.541 --> 42:48.721
Maybe being extremely silly?

42:48.741 --> 42:50.142
Yeah.

42:50.642 --> 42:54.163
But this will be the first time you can see all five of us together!

42:54.223 --> 42:55.103
Together!

42:55.143 --> 42:56.483
So please be there!

42:56.563 --> 42:57.584
Don't forget, okay?

42:57.604 --> 43:00.565
I feel like a lot of Ruffians may be forgotten.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.265
Adventrix may be forgotten.

43:02.285 --> 43:04.846
So please let them know, okay?

43:05.086 --> 43:07.587
Yeah, and together we're gonna light the fire!

43:07.607 --> 43:08.667
Yeah!

43:08.767 --> 43:09.167
BAU BAU!

43:11.240 --> 43:12.981
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

43:13.102 --> 43:15.203
Let's take a look at our schedule too!

43:15.283 --> 43:16.083
Actual next stream.

43:16.263 --> 43:16.403
Oh!

43:16.523 --> 43:17.684
Actual next stream!

43:17.784 --> 43:17.984
Yeah!

43:18.084 --> 43:18.825
Do not forget!

43:18.845 --> 43:20.586
Do not forget!

43:20.706 --> 43:23.227
We have our Rock n' Rawr Party!

43:23.287 --> 43:25.428
We're singing only hololive songs!

43:25.768 --> 43:30.211
I'm so excited because there's so many songs we want to sing of ourselves but we still haven't been able to sing it.

43:30.471 --> 43:32.792
So we're gonna try a bunch of new ones too!

43:32.872 --> 43:35.594
I still can't believe we haven't sung Everblue yet!

43:35.674 --> 43:36.835
Right?!

43:37.975 --> 43:38.215
Why?

43:38.235 --> 43:38.896
I don't know.

43:39.276 --> 43:41.757
And we won't be singing it tomorrow.

43:41.858 --> 43:42.158
No.

43:42.878 --> 43:43.358
Yeah.

43:43.439 --> 43:44.079
Or tonight...

43:44.679 --> 43:46.921
Yeah.

43:47.021 --> 43:48.402
But please join us, okay?

43:48.522 --> 43:49.382
Ruffians!

43:49.782 --> 43:52.304
BAU BAU!

43:52.724 --> 43:54.325
I think it's just too emotional, huh?

43:54.365 --> 43:54.545
Yeah.

43:54.685 --> 43:55.086
It's hard.

43:55.226 --> 43:56.627
I need to prepare.

43:56.667 --> 43:57.027
Yeah.

43:57.527 --> 43:58.928
Oh, and our schedule!

43:59.248 --> 44:02.990
Yeah, we have also, we're gonna be in Seoul for POPCON!

44:03.291 --> 44:07.133
We'll be doing our best BAU BAU-ing a bunch and meeting some Ruffians there!

44:07.633 --> 44:11.636
And then we'll also be doing an off-club together with Haachama-senpai!

44:11.656 --> 44:12.916
We're playing Hollow Cocoon!

44:13.337 --> 44:15.318
And that's at 3AM PT!

44:15.418 --> 44:16.959
It's a little bit early!

44:16.979 --> 44:18.440
Quite a bit early!

44:18.720 --> 44:23.623
But there will be an archive, so Ruffians, if you're maybe getting your zzz's done,

44:24.103 --> 44:26.264
Please, please, check it out when you wake up.

44:26.304 --> 44:28.145
Check it out when you wake up.

And for the Muffins joining us in the archive today.

44:35.668 --> 44:38.008

Thank you so much, Ruffians!

44:45.673 --> 44:46.313

44:46.433 --> 44:49.235
It was a very big FUWAMOCO morning today, huh?

44:49.716 --> 44:52.858
But for a very, very fun weekend!

44:52.978 --> 44:55.420
And our 3D collab together with Alvin!

44:55.440 --> 44:56.421
BAU BAU!

44:56.501 --> 44:58.122

44:58.142 --> 45:03.947
