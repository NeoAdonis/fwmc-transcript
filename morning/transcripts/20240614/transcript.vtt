00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:13.609
Both of us!

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:25.012
Thank you so much for waking up early and joining us today for our 99th episode!

00:05:25.032 --> 00:05:26.012
99!

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.393
Can you believe it?

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:32.674
The last episode of FUWAMOCO Morning with two numbers beside it.

00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:35.075
Are you sad, Ruffians?

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:40.375
We have one more before 100!

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:43.856
That's how it works, right?

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.336
Numbers, huh?

00:05:46.356 --> 00:05:47.356
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:50.877
Your two numbers is over.

00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:55.298
A little bit lonely, but you cried a little!

00:05:55.318 --> 00:05:56.378
Don't worry!

00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:59.479
It's still early for that!

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.560
But that means we'll be getting a new number for next time, right?

00:06:05.307 --> 00:06:06.193
Is that how it works?

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:07.159
I numbers friends.

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:08.406
Not my friends.

00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:11.701

Moco-chan, where'd the second hashtag go?

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:49.044
I didn't see hashtag, hashtag denied!

00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:54.846

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.565

00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:13.787
It's necessary!

00:07:14.347 --> 00:07:15.449
Necessary!

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.492
You have to say pretty please, Ruffians!

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:19.815
Pretty please!

00:07:20.055 --> 00:07:21.057
Pretty please!

00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:21.317
Ruffians!

00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:25.662
If you put it that nicely then.

00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:30.626

Wow, I didn't expect that kind of reaction, huh?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.140
That's more like it!

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.900
Ruffians still saying pretty please!

00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:58.962
If you ask Ruffians to say pretty please, they'll continue saying it for a very long time.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:03.422
Your day is made!

00:08:04.103 --> 00:08:05.963
Well, I'm just about to ruin it.

00:08:06.783 --> 00:08:10.344
Guys, there's been another peron sighting.

00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:17.027
You know, recently it's been pretty bad.

00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:19.229
Pero's been seen in a bunch of places.

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:20.010
Yeah.

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:23.112
What place has he been seen now?

00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.214
Well, let's take a look.

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:29.017
De-den!

00:08:29.698 --> 00:08:31.800
Oh no.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.905
Did Pero sneak into your PC and cause problems?

00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:42.649
Ruffians, have you been having any computer troubles?

00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:46.523
Has it been slow and mild?

00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:51.208
You know, maybe you should open it up and check things out.

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:59.898
Otherwise, a big blob with ears and wings could have installed himself without you knowing.

00:09:00.638 --> 00:09:01.720
Pero Sensor.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.381
Pero Peace.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:06.720
Ruffians!

00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:30.547
I'm pretty sure there's been more than a few Ruffians with this issue though before, right, Moco-chan?

00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:32.529
I think I saw some, hi.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:39.056
Ruffians, you need to make sure that you keep yourself and your computer safe, okay?

00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:41.859
You're one to speak, hi!

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:44.222
You need to stay safe, okay?

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:45.563
Not wearing a virus.

00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:46.324
Yeah.

00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:52.196
But your computer is not an appropriate place for Pero to be staying in.

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:53.557
And you know what?

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:57.518
He'll stay there forever if he thinks he can get away with it.

00:09:57.538 --> 00:09:57.978
He will.

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:58.818
Yeah.

00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:00.359
You wouldn't want that, huh?

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:01.079
Yeah.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:01.479
No.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:10.422
Ruffians, you know, if your computer, if it's slowing down and there are loud sounds from it, especially if it's like a really nasty loud.

00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:12.642
Gotta check it out right away, okay?

00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:13.363
Yeah, okay.

00:10:13.403 --> 00:10:15.043
Can't put it off, okay?

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.844
You have to be proactive.

00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:21.575
Peroactive.

00:10:22.396 --> 00:10:23.217
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:10:23.237 --> 00:10:23.498
Proactive!

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:23.818
Pero.

00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:24.639
BAU BAU!

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.484
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:29.366
Yeah.

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:37.528
BAU BAU!

00:11:06.127 --> 00:11:08.148
Congratulations Sora-senpai!

00:11:08.188 --> 00:11:09.668
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:09.688 --> 00:11:11.549
We're so excited!

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.969
Yeah!

00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:13.850
Did you hear about the opening?

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.690
It's huge!

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.010
Yeah, and the anime!

00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:19.352
It's called My Wife Has No Emotion.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:23.793
And the song is called Okaerinasai.

00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:24.733
So cute!

00:11:24.913 --> 00:11:27.434
And I am so excited!

00:11:27.514 --> 00:11:28.335
Yeah, yeah!

00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:31.936
Not just because you know Sora-senpai sang the opening theme song.

00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:33.316
Very exciting, very exciting!

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:34.177
It's because...

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:36.378
There's Mii Robots.

00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:40.302
And I love Mii Robots!

00:11:40.622 --> 00:11:42.744
Especially when they fall in love.

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:47.948
So I'll definitely be watching this anime.

00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:51.071
It starts airing at the beginning of next month.

00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:51.651
So soon.

00:11:52.632 --> 00:11:54.294
Right soon!

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.697
It sounds so cute!

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.519
And I will probably cry a bunch.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.922
You can actually already check out the song as well!

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:04.123
Yeah!

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:07.526
Check out Tokinosora-senpai on Twitter!

00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:10.449
She has a whole bunch more information about it here.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.910
Here we have a comment left.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.151
BAU BAU!

00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:37.724
One day!

00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:42.905
We can sing anime opening songs here!

00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:44.525
One day.

00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:45.426
One day maybe.

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:46.846
Yeah, not today.

00:12:46.886 --> 00:12:47.566
Not tomorrow.

00:12:48.206 --> 00:12:48.606
One day.

00:12:48.866 --> 00:12:49.307
Maybe!

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:57.209
Yeah, you know, both Kyary-senpai and Sora-senpai sing anime songs now!

00:12:57.229 --> 00:12:59.349
So amazing!

00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:02.470
We have such amazing senpai FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:13:04.161 --> 00:13:04.582
BAU BAU!

00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:05.183
Congratulations!

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.671
FUWAMOCO!

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:25.937
Well, speaking of Ai-senpai, you know, there's been some exciting new looks being supported by our EN-senpai!

00:13:26.197 --> 00:13:32.961
So, and you know, like, the seasons are changing and fashion, fashion kind of changes along with the seasons.

00:13:33.322 --> 00:13:38.665
So we thought that, you know, with the beginning of summer here, that we could, like, a bit of a look at them!

00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:38.885
Yeah!

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:39.706
Yeah, first,

00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:42.707
We have Kiara-senpai!

00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:48.170
She has her new, brand new, 80's exercise style outfit!

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.590
It's so cute!

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.091
Right?

00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:51.772
Thanks for waiting!

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:56.874
Yeah, it's got some, uh, breathing holes on the sleeves there.

00:13:56.894 --> 00:13:59.195
I sort of have that for my New Year's outfit.

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:00.696
A little bit, right?

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:08.984
You know, maybe it's not quite an 80s thing, but it's always fun to do exercise videos on YouTube, right?

00:14:09.004 --> 00:14:11.106
It's sort of the same feel, right?

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:17.933
Yeah, maybe Kiara-senpai, maybe she'll release some cool exercise videos to do together with the KFP!

00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:18.474
Yeah!

00:14:18.494 --> 00:14:19.034
Right!

00:14:19.054 --> 00:14:21.156
Fuwawa-boshi, what?

00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:32.569
Excuse me.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.951
I like to be able to focus on my exercising.

00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:44.316
And you know, um, if, if I, if I'm a bit exposed then, uh... Where the FUWAMOCO going?!

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:44.496
What?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:15:00.023
There's also, Moco-chan, I know, what about Mococo is what you're saying, but what about Kronii-senpai?

00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:00.623
Right?

00:15:00.663 --> 00:15:10.406
Recently Kronii-senpai also got a new outfit too!

00:15:11.406 --> 00:15:14.647
Super cool and controlling commanding Kronii!

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:17.738
BAU BAU!

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:54.782
FUWAMOCO Morning was a big one!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:59.385
Bae-senpai also got a brand new outfit!

00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:02.727
It's a very chuny chaos red sleeve.

00:16:02.747 --> 00:16:04.949
She has an eye patch too, Moco-chan!

00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:09.128
Yeah, bunnies!

00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:14.169
Yeah, but both her and Kronii-senpai kind of look like they could whip you into shape, right?

00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:17.330
But, couldn't Kiara-senpai also whip you into shape, too?

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.271
I guess... A different kind of whip you into shape, girl!

00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:23.331
Yeah, we're gonna whip you into shape, huh?

00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:27.252
Yeah, you better listen to what we have to say, huh?

00:16:27.732 --> 00:16:31.553
Yeah... What do you think, Ruffians?

00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:33.914
If FUWAMOCO is to get new outfits,

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:35.915
What do you think are the best?

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:38.135
Maybe cool outfits like these?

00:16:38.276 --> 00:16:39.716
Or do you think they would suit us?

00:16:39.836 --> 00:16:42.077
Or wear something more cute and comfy?

00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:42.697
Yeah.

00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:43.558
That would be better.

00:16:43.818 --> 00:16:44.838
Yeah.

00:16:45.418 --> 00:16:46.479
Huh?

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:47.959
Sleeves!

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:48.640
Sleeves!

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.340
Sleeves!

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.121
Do we not have enough sleeves for you now?

00:16:52.141 --> 00:16:52.321
Sure, sure!

00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:53.502
Bikinis!

00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:54.922
Ruffians!

00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:56.823
What are you two wearing now?

00:16:56.843 --> 00:16:58.023
Astronaut outfits!

00:16:58.324 --> 00:16:59.744
Like Ame-senpai!

00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:00.444
So cute!

00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:01.745
Princess outfits!

00:17:03.284 --> 00:17:03.804
Comfy.

00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:04.585
Combat.

00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:05.746
Comfy.

00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:06.547
Combat.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.508
Bikini.

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.869
Swimsuit.

00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:09.750
Pajamas.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.191
Swimsuit.

00:17:10.471 --> 00:17:11.012
Bikini.

00:17:11.212 --> 00:17:11.692
Swimsuit.

00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:12.353
Pajamas.

00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:18.379
BAU BAU!

00:17:48.887 --> 00:17:49.867
I like pajamas.

00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:54.230
Fluffy and fuzzy pajamas for the fluffy and fuzzy ones, you know?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.030
It's always good.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:55.931
Always good.

00:17:57.471 --> 00:17:59.152
BAU BAU!

00:17:59.672 --> 00:18:10.138
Ruffians, maybe you know you've been a little bit busy and haven't really noticed, but FUWAMOCO, we've been undergoing some very serious training.

00:18:10.238 --> 00:18:10.558
Yeah.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.170
Training.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.291
In Minecraft!

00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:16.371
Yeah!

00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:21.053
You know, it might be hard to believe, but... FUWAMOCO!

00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:24.094
We really don't know much about Minecraft.

00:18:24.114 --> 00:18:28.355
We don't really have had any experience with it until we joined hololive.

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:28.915
Right!

00:18:31.036 --> 00:18:31.776
No experience.

00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:33.189
We never played it.

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.530
No.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.931
So, now we're trying our best to learn the basics.

00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:37.431
Yeah!

00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:42.253
Along with your very much appreciated help, obviously.

00:18:42.373 --> 00:18:43.314
Unnecessary help.

00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:43.894
Yeah.

00:18:44.194 --> 00:18:47.856
You know, and so far we've learned how to survive night time.

00:18:47.956 --> 00:18:49.196
Night time was very scary.

00:18:49.236 --> 00:18:49.416
Yeah.

00:18:51.418 --> 00:18:55.764
I made a bazillion stone pickaxes all at once.

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:57.326
And we caught sheep.

00:18:57.927 --> 00:19:03.234
And finally, we're starting to be able to make and eat food.

00:19:04.236 --> 00:19:05.778
Amongst a bunch of other things.

00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:09.821
It's a very comfy time.

00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:12.042
You know, we're dual streaming it.

00:19:12.102 --> 00:19:15.884
So that means it's Fuwawa POV and my POV.

00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:16.845
Yeah.

00:19:17.145 --> 00:19:23.308
So you know, you can check maybe Moco-chan out as she minds and Fuwawa as I make food.

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.030
I'm still not sure how food works though.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.652
Cause Moco-chan, your tummy killed you, right?

00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:31.033
I think so, yeah.

00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:33.274
I thought someone was shooting at me, but no.

00:19:33.934 --> 00:19:35.135
I don't know how it works.

00:19:35.195 --> 00:19:37.637
Why does it have two food bars?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.641
You just eat it, that's all.

00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.262
We'll have to find out next time.

00:19:43.663 --> 00:19:52.451
But because we're both streaming at the same time, you can hear both of us in the background, we can chat amongst each other.

00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:57.335
I think it makes a kind of a unique experience, a bit of a different kind of Minecraft.

00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:01.416
Ruffians, but!

00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:05.960
We're gonna be doing our best to continue our training weekly!

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.085
So please join us this weekend for a nice, relaxing... Yeah.

00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:13.146
Just Minecraft time together.

00:20:13.166 --> 00:20:14.728
Minecraft time teaches common sense.

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:16.450
Please, please.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.992
Okay, backseating is okay, okay.

00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:21.555
Please, please help, okay.

00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:22.657
BAU BAU!

00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:28.103
Yeah, it's a big learning experience, yeah.

00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:30.986
Thank you for all the help, Ruffians!

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:31.547
Thank you!

00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:36.091
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

00:20:36.251 --> 00:20:37.292
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

00:20:37.312 --> 00:20:39.534
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:40.515
FUWAMOCO Minecraft.

00:20:41.395 --> 00:20:44.077
BAU BAU!

00:20:44.658 --> 00:20:53.625
Well, as I said, you know, Ruffians, right now, it's the summer of Advent within the year of FUWAMOCO!

00:20:54.506 --> 00:20:59.930
You know, that means that FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be zooming around!

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.152
You know, not only have zoomies,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.341
This summer time, yeah.

00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:10.026
Tired and slow zoomies.

00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:22.538
But not only will we just be at New York City for the hololive English second month of Breaking Dimensions, but we'll also be in Australia for Smash!

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.930
Bye!

00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:31.941
Are we gonna be playing Minecraft in Australia?

00:21:32.002 --> 00:21:34.290
No, we're not playing Minecraft in Australia!

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.003
That would be exciting though.

00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:41.566
I'm sure there's a lot of things like creepers and fuzzy mistakes.

00:21:41.746 --> 00:21:45.029
You know those kind of Minecraft enemies, the purple guy?

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:47.451
Probably in Australia too, right?

00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.632
That makes sense.

00:21:48.672 --> 00:21:49.032
Yeah.

00:21:49.373 --> 00:21:53.116
But it'll be our first time down under high!

00:21:53.156 --> 00:21:53.836
Yeah!

00:21:54.157 --> 00:21:55.918
We're working hard to prepare for it.

00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:57.419
Right now!

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.322
Through Smash's SNS, you can send them a question.

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:03.524
You'd like to have us answer at the event too?

00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:04.285
Yeah.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:11.571
Alright, so if there's any Ruffians planning on going, please send Smash your questions and we'll answer them there for you.

00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:15.314
And you know, maybe there's some silly Ruffians out there.

00:22:15.714 --> 00:22:20.358
You might ask a question too, but you won't be at the event.

00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:22.139
Ruffians!

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.303
Do you know what you can do to get your question answered even if you won't be going to Australia?

00:22:30.122 --> 00:22:34.144
You know, right?

00:22:34.264 --> 00:22:36.425
Oh my gosh, I don't think they know, Moco-chan.

00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:37.546
We say it every time.

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:39.907
We say it every time, Ruffians!

00:22:41.428 --> 00:22:42.068
Yeah!

00:22:42.408 --> 00:22:45.070
Hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.176
Okay, Ruffians, no pouting, okay?

00:22:53.236 --> 00:22:55.440
I think you're distracted by the hashtag hashtag!

00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:57.484
They don't know what the hashtag is for!

00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:59.769
Moco-chan, you gotta cut that out then, okay?

00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:08.994
And also, the lottery for our meet and greet tickets will be opening soon, okay?

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:14.877
They'll be opening at 8am Australia time on the 20th this month.

00:23:15.377 --> 00:23:21.541
So any Australian Ruffians who'd like to chat with us, please mark it into your calendars, okay?

00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:25.163
8am, bright and early, down under.

00:23:25.883 --> 00:23:32.024
You know, we think we'll be able to talk with more Ruffians this time compared to our first meet-and-greet in Taipei.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:32.504
Right!

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:39.725
We're so excited to talk to you face-to-face, Ruffians!

00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:42.626
Please show us your biggest smiles, okay?

00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:43.286
Got it!

00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:46.347
BAU BAU!

00:23:46.447 --> 00:23:48.267
We're excited!

00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:52.308
It'll definitely be a super fun time.

00:23:52.328 --> 00:23:52.408
Yeah.

00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:53.388
Wow.

00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:57.343
There's some exciting things.

00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.384
No, it's also not exciting, Ruffians.

00:24:01.945 --> 00:24:03.025
When you make a mistake.

00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:03.765
Yeah.

00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:09.328
And, uh, Fuwawa, uh, I have some bad news.

00:24:10.948 --> 00:24:11.369
Yeah?

00:24:11.929 --> 00:24:19.352
You know, the other day when we were out with Nerissa, we actually brought some new pajamas together!

00:24:19.392 --> 00:24:20.832
Did Nerissa give you pajamas?

00:24:21.313 --> 00:24:21.373
No.

00:24:23.014 --> 00:24:25.997
FUWAMOCO we bought pajamas.

00:24:26.477 --> 00:24:26.957
She was with us.

00:24:26.978 --> 00:24:27.898
We counted together.

00:24:27.998 --> 00:24:29.680
And she bought pajamas from the same place.

00:24:31.163 --> 00:24:34.124
Pajamas are really fluffy and fuzzy and luxurious.

00:24:57.572 --> 00:24:58.532
Yeah.

00:24:58.632 --> 00:25:03.714
Actually, FUWAMOCO, we'd really like to have a collaboration with them one day.

00:25:03.734 --> 00:25:03.814
Yeah!

00:25:04.114 --> 00:25:06.115
You know, because we're fluffy and fuzzy.

00:25:06.915 --> 00:25:09.116
But, uh... Cute pajamas, you know?

00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:09.516
Yeah.

00:25:09.936 --> 00:25:11.016
Cuter than this!

00:25:11.856 --> 00:25:18.738
But, uh, so the new pajamas, I decided to wear them for the first time this morning.

00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:27.141
And you know, Ruffians, whenever you get something that's brand new, you're always very careful not to get it dirty or hurt.

00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:29.280
Right!

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:39.006
So, I was very very careful until you know, I got a bit too excited while I was drinking my matcha latte.

00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:47.072
And uh, I ended up missing my mouth and accidentally poured it down the front of my pajamas.

00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:53.449
I was like, to Moco-chan, Moco-chan, help!

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.311
Tissues, tissues!

00:25:55.411 --> 00:25:57.372
But we're all out of tissues!

00:25:57.412 --> 00:26:00.214
There was a lot of latte everywhere!

00:26:00.514 --> 00:26:03.777
So Moco-chan was just like, take it off, Moco-chan!

00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:07.519
So I took it off and I quickly rinsed it with cold water.

00:26:10.061 --> 00:26:12.743
I think I got a lot of the matcha off, but...

00:26:13.632 --> 00:26:16.874
We'll see how it is after it's done with the wash.

00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:17.314
Yeah.

00:26:17.754 --> 00:26:18.335
Yeah.

00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:22.137
It was a really horrible steam bath, Moco-chan.

00:26:22.317 --> 00:26:22.997
It was bad.

00:26:23.698 --> 00:26:29.201
But luckily we have steam remover because I... This is not a rare occurrence.

00:26:30.662 --> 00:26:31.082
Yeah.

00:26:32.243 --> 00:26:35.224
I accidentally... What?

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:41.288
I accidentally sprayed something on Moco-chan the other day which stained your shirt.

00:26:42.068 --> 00:26:42.549
Yeah.

00:26:43.439 --> 00:26:43.599
Yeah.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.360
Yeah.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.101
It just happened.

00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:45.402
But, uh, yeah.

00:26:57.145 --> 00:26:57.625
I don't know.

00:26:57.685 --> 00:26:59.165
I can't believe I was that clumsy.

00:26:59.205 --> 00:27:00.286
I just missed my mouth.

00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:00.546
Again.

00:27:01.726 --> 00:27:09.248
But my mouth tattoo... If it's no good, we'll just have to hope that we can get some more cute pajamas soon.

00:27:09.268 --> 00:27:10.348
Right, Moco-chan?

00:27:10.688 --> 00:27:11.328
Hopefully.

00:27:12.188 --> 00:27:13.108
Hopefully.

00:27:13.128 --> 00:27:16.489
BAU BAU!

00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:19.690
Yeah, I'm gonna try not to miss my mouth again.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.010
Do your best.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:21.830
Yeah.

00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:24.531
Well, Ruffians!

00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:31.140
And that means today we get to see another Doggie of the Day!

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.621
Does it have to do with the end of the week?

00:27:33.182 --> 00:27:35.623
I don't know, I just know Doggie of the Day, Doggie of the Day.

00:27:36.144 --> 00:27:38.025
I'm excited for the Doggie of the Day.

00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:38.085
Hi!

00:27:38.185 --> 00:27:41.107
This is the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan!

00:27:41.988 --> 00:27:44.590
We have a de-den!

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.451
Akami!

00:27:46.271 --> 00:27:48.133
Alchemy!

00:27:48.173 --> 00:27:49.614
Really fitting name, huh?

00:27:49.654 --> 00:27:50.215
Right!

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.236
Look at the powerful eyes and- Right!

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:53.758
Is that a coffee cup?

00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:55.419
I think so, you know.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:56.980
Cuz you know Alchemy!

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.722
Alchemy is a wolf hybrid!

00:27:59.742 --> 00:27:59.802
Huh!

00:28:00.283 --> 00:28:02.945
Actually, doggy looks wow, really cool, right?

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:04.046
Really cool!

00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:05.727
Just a big goofball!

00:28:06.068 --> 00:28:06.968
Love his, like, eyes.

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:08.450
Looks cool!

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.051
Big goofball, huh?

00:28:10.451 --> 00:28:13.314
I don't know if we have the looks cool part down, but...

00:28:14.094 --> 00:28:16.237
I don't exactly like Alchemy, no.

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:27.349
Alchemy also likes to have fun and cuddle, and as seen here, likes to collect objects while on walks.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.075
You know, maybe Alchemy is going to use them for us.

00:28:34.569 --> 00:28:34.869
Maybe.

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:37.011
Don't know what's in the cup.

00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:37.591
Right.

00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:40.573
Don't know what's in the cup.

00:28:40.914 --> 00:28:43.776
How does Alchemy BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

00:28:45.077 --> 00:28:47.619
Alchemy looks cool, but... But?

00:28:47.939 --> 00:28:51.442
I think the BAU BAU is like... BAU BAU!

00:28:51.502 --> 00:28:52.463
BAU BAU!

00:28:52.483 --> 00:28:52.723
Really?

00:28:52.803 --> 00:28:53.544
BAU BAU!

00:28:53.924 --> 00:28:54.745
I disagree.

00:28:54.785 --> 00:28:56.686
It's like... BAU BAU!

00:28:57.727 --> 00:28:58.368
BAU BAU!

00:28:58.388 --> 00:28:59.448
Like that.

00:28:59.588 --> 00:29:00.189
Really?

00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:00.990
Yeah!

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.230
No.

00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:04.358
You disagree, right, Ruffians?

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.640
BAU BAU!

00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:11.246
Why?

00:29:11.406 --> 00:29:15.291
Alchemy looks wise as the name suggests, you know?

00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:15.712
But...

00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:21.105
Pretty silly, just like FUWAMOCO!

00:29:21.145 --> 00:29:21.626
Right?

00:29:23.148 --> 00:29:25.911
It must be nice looking all serious though.

00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:29.556
You know, if Akuma goes extreme violence, you're gonna run away.

00:29:29.576 --> 00:29:29.616
Hi!

00:29:30.957 --> 00:29:31.738
Just like us, too!

00:29:31.758 --> 00:29:31.798
Hi!

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:31.899
Hi!

00:29:35.114 --> 00:29:36.694
BAU BAU!

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.215
BAU BAU!

00:29:40.235 --> 00:29:44.216
How come he's so cool?

00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:45.837
I'm cool, though.

00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:47.497
BAU BAU!

00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.718
And next, Ruffians!

00:29:50.798 --> 00:29:53.579
Show us where you've been going on a walk, huh?

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:54.859
Let's take a walk!

00:29:55.828 --> 00:29:58.351
We have de-den!

00:29:59.052 --> 00:29:59.353
What?

00:29:59.493 --> 00:29:59.833
What?

00:29:59.953 --> 00:30:00.234
What?

00:30:00.955 --> 00:30:01.455
Oh!

00:30:01.475 --> 00:30:02.777
A boulder field!

00:30:02.797 --> 00:30:03.919
A boulder field!

00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:05.761
A camping trip!

00:30:05.781 --> 00:30:07.984
So when someone is like, I want a boulder!

00:30:08.805 --> 00:30:09.686
Is this where they go?

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:10.567
Get them from?

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.300
Like a rock store.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.141
Oh, but a field!

00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:20.243
Kind of like a pumpkin field, but with boulders, right?

00:30:20.283 --> 00:30:20.963
Right!

00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:24.244
They have pebbles a little bit bigger than pebbles.

00:30:24.264 --> 00:30:26.385
Bee-boo land!

00:30:26.465 --> 00:30:29.106
You went on a camping trip to bee-boo land!

00:30:29.447 --> 00:30:30.587
Rock, rock!

00:30:30.727 --> 00:30:33.808
This is the pebbles' birthplace!

00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:36.229
But this looks so cool!

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:42.472
I'm sure it's really hard to walk across the... Every time you step on the pebbles, it... Bleh!

00:30:45.025 --> 00:30:47.627
We're very glad you did what you saw.

00:30:48.067 --> 00:30:52.369
And I hope you had an amazing camping trip too.

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:54.851
BAU BAU!

00:30:55.191 --> 00:31:01.074
And our Question of the Day we have... De-den!

00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:03.816
Good morning, Fuwawa-chan!

00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:05.177
Good morning, Moco-chan!

00:31:05.237 --> 00:31:06.478
Good morning!

00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:16.087
If you were to take out each advent member to a two-on-one or even one-on-one date, where would you take each of them on one date?

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:19.196
I think this is an easy question.

00:31:19.356 --> 00:31:20.437
Right, Moco-chan?

00:31:20.978 --> 00:31:23.600
There's so many places I want to go with them.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.201
Shiori!

00:31:25.261 --> 00:31:28.043
Read to some kind of place that's very unique to Japan.

00:31:28.263 --> 00:31:30.905
Maybe somewhere more with subculture.

00:31:31.445 --> 00:31:33.287
And more books that she wants.

00:31:33.687 --> 00:31:34.208
Yeah.

00:31:34.508 --> 00:31:38.551
I think she's been saying she wants to go find more books.

00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:40.072
Yeah.

00:31:40.112 --> 00:31:42.774
Now there's a lot of places I can think of.

00:31:43.035 --> 00:31:44.416
Ah, for Nerissa!

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.598
Some place that's like classy and has a meet.

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:48.819
Has a meet.

00:31:48.939 --> 00:31:49.460
Yeah.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.123
So some place you know that is kind of like Japan, but classy.

00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:55.084
With a meet.

00:31:55.384 --> 00:31:55.825
With a meet.

00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:56.525
Yeah.

00:31:57.646 --> 00:32:00.048
And then, Biboo!

00:32:00.088 --> 00:32:02.790
Somewhere maybe more fun, and like, younger, hip.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.331
Hip!

00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:08.014
Maybe somewhere that has games, like a theme park or something.

00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:09.855
Yeah.

00:32:09.916 --> 00:32:13.338
You know, Dagashiya-san.

00:32:13.518 --> 00:32:13.879
Right.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:15.039
That would be fun.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.141
Problem is, it'd be fun with all of them.

00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:20.003
Yeah, I'd like to take all of Advent to Dagashiya-san.

00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:24.747
Yeah, you know, like a Japanese candy store.

00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:25.167
Right?

00:32:25.227 --> 00:32:26.108
Sweet store.

00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:37.204
There's just so many places and such a long list of things we want to do together with Advent.

00:32:38.103 --> 00:32:41.907
But I don't know if we have enough time this time.

00:32:41.987 --> 00:32:45.270
It's tricky trying to get everybody's schedules to line up, you know?

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.850
Yeah.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:50.875
So, you know, we might only be able to do so much together this time.

00:32:51.335 --> 00:32:55.299
But we'll treasure the moments that we do have to share together.

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:56.019
Yeah!

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.000
BAU BAU!

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.962
BAU BAU!

00:32:59.443 --> 00:33:00.924
Yeah, so many places.

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:02.725
BAU BAU!

00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:06.787
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:33:07.548 --> 00:33:08.709
Thank you so much!

00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:16.813
So, so much for 99 episodes of your submissions of spending all these mornings together.

00:33:17.154 --> 00:33:27.820
But Ruffians, I want to remind you, just because we're about to reach 100 episodes doesn't mean you get to stop submitting your doggy of the days, your walks,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.126
Your questions, your Pero Sightings, okay?

00:33:31.146 --> 00:33:32.569
Doesn't mean that you get to stop.

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:38.862
We're always looking for new submissions, so please remember, use the hashtag!

00:33:40.697 --> 00:33:43.560
F-W-M-C-MORNING!

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.180
Okay.

00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:44.481
Yeah.

00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:47.324
If you say hashtag, hashtag, they're not gonna focus, right?

00:33:47.344 --> 00:33:47.844
No.

00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:48.285
Yeah.

00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:50.407
BAU BAU!

00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:52.269
BAU BAU!

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.254
Well, we have a new stream coming up very soon, right, Moco-chan?

00:33:56.274 --> 00:33:56.874
Yeah!

00:33:56.914 --> 00:33:57.775
Our next stream is...

00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:01.476
Mbembe Radio.

00:34:01.636 --> 00:34:03.297
Yeah, Mbembe Radio.

00:34:03.357 --> 00:34:09.679
It's a horror adventure game where, you know, we kind of explore things on the way back home from school.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.760
And then we kind of notice some strange occurrences happening.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.541
I have no clue about it.

00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:17.362
It's something sort of obscure and there's an Mbembe Radio!

00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:18.982
Mbembe... What's an Mbembe?

00:34:19.002 --> 00:34:19.362
BAU BAU!

00:34:47.875 --> 00:34:55.222
And then, on Sunday, we're gonna be having a watch-along of "Hachi: a Dog's Tale" together with our Doggy Pack!

00:34:56.664 --> 00:34:57.685
I'm looking forward to it.

00:34:57.725 --> 00:35:00.147
Just a nice time watching a movie all together.

00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:05.011
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:35:05.392 --> 00:35:11.937
