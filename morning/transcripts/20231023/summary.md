## Good (?) News (15:35)

FUWAMOCO decided that enough was enough and changed a faulty light bulb at their home by themselves. Alas when it rains, it pours, and now the bulb at the bathroom is out.

## Confession (18:20)

Fuwawa caught Mococo drinking a "rat king tea" made out of 14 bags of tea that Mococo herself saved for 2 weeks, let dry and reused, claiming it would be a waste just to throw them away after using them only once.

## Misunderstanding (22:46)

Last FUWAMOCO's "Convenience Store" stream saw a [hug pile](https://youtu.be/CGfOWj0IZSQ?t=10462) that went on over 40 minutes! Following karaoke stream, a Ruffian tried to take it a step further and, as if they were a shojo manga male protagonist, [they asked to kiss Fuwawa and Mococo's paw](https://youtu.be/xIyBZHUcSZM?t=10673). FUWAMOCO don't want Ruffians to misunderstand that this is perfectly OK as it makes them blush.

## Natto Challenge (25:09)

After 7 weeks of starting this enduring challenge, Mococo actually did it: [she properly ate and chewed the natto](https://youtu.be/VV4H3SFTb8k?t=1820)! The second time if you ask Moco-chan but who's counting?

## Doggie of the Day (32:20)

[ScalieDino](https://twitter.com/DinoScalie/status/1707295227411824889) shows us a pic of Dodo the husky.

## Today I Went On A Walk (34:28)

[levinky?](https://twitter.com/levinky_art/status/1715713078187483457) took a walk in Japan and made a quick stop to try the so-revered Pon-de-rings. Their verdict: not as good as advertised.

## Question Of The Day (36:06)

[Miyako](https://twitter.com/MoeMoeMiyako/status/1713476110871384572) wonders if Fuwawa and Mococo have each their own set of mic and headphones for the streams. The sisters confirm this and explain a bit in detail how these are hooked up so they can hear and transmit audio, and how this setup is quite different from other hololive members.

## Next Stream & Schedule (38:35)

## Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians (41:31)
