00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.637
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:16.724
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:20.632
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.450
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.250
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.051
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:33.951
BAU BAU!

00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:38.432
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:41.253
BAU BAU!

00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:42.313
Ruffians!

00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:43.473
Are you awake?

00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:45.494
Are you ready?

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:47.814
Because today's our 109th episode!

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:48.595
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:58.821
Thank you so much for joining us here today on this wonderful FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:02.064
BAU BAU!

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.227
I see some new Ruffians maybe!

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:07.408
Wide awake?

00:06:07.528 --> 00:06:09.190
Yeah, you're awake.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.273
Well, maybe this is the first time that you're joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:16.556
And if it is, well, it's important that you know.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:22.882
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short 4-nap morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:24.584
Aka FUWAMOCO!

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.926
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:31.150
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.412
You start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:34.092
Yeah!

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:39.416
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:43.399
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.761
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:50.584
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:54.307
Today feels like a really special FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:56.689
I don't know why, though.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:57.990
It's just the 109th.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.011
Do you feel the same way?

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.610
Maybe it's because you're here with us this morning!

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.171
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:07.252
BAU BAU!

00:07:07.592 --> 00:07:08.632
Everyday is special!

00:07:08.652 --> 00:07:09.933
It is.

00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:12.674
Why are we gonna ruin the special?

00:07:12.734 --> 00:07:21.158
Because I... There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:23.399
Let's see where he was.

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:25.140
That way we can avoid it.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.181
That makes sense, right Ruffians?

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:28.722
Yeah.

00:07:29.022 --> 00:07:29.202
Yeah.

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:51.764
Oh!

00:08:02.696 --> 00:08:03.989
Go out for walks, but...

00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:08.147
It's important to do the Ruffian thing.

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.688
It's important to go outside.

00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.989
You have to go outside, okay?

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:12.649
I say so.

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:17.451
You know, to stretch the paws for your physical health, but also, you know, for your mind too.

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.432
You have to go outside, okay?

00:08:20.012 --> 00:08:20.412
I know.

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:24.314
It makes a big difference for us too, right, Moco-chan?

00:08:24.454 --> 00:08:25.794
Even though it's hot outside.

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:27.015
Except when it's hot.

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:31.857
It's still important to go outside, Moco-chan.

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:39.111
Yeah, so Ruffians, let's all make sure that we go outside for walks often, okay?

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:44.112
Just, uh, maybe try not to look at the sky too much if you can.

00:08:44.152 --> 00:08:46.993
You get around 10,000 steps a day, good job!

00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:47.953
Good, good!

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:48.753
You can do it!

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.954
Continue to do your best!

00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:52.894
Just don't look at the sky too often, okay?

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:53.495
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:55.155
Otherwise you may spot Peron!

00:08:55.655 --> 00:08:57.015
And that would be no good, okay?

00:08:57.055 --> 00:08:58.656
Yeah, that would be pretty nasty.

00:08:58.996 --> 00:08:59.456
Yeah.

00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:00.816
BAU BAU!

00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:06.595
I hope we don't spot Pero.

00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:10.899
It would be nice to see, you know, like, anything else.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:11.739
Yeah!

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.120
Yeah.

00:09:15.774 --> 00:09:18.536
Moco-chan, we have some exciting news!

00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:23.199
Ruffians, we've had so much exciting news to share with you, right?

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:28.402
But this time, it's actually not just our own good news.

00:09:28.562 --> 00:09:30.803
Not just FUWAMOCO's good news.

00:09:31.063 --> 00:09:36.707
But Icomochi-mama has some good news too!

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:41.370
Icomochi-mama will be holding a solo exhibition of all her books!

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.190
BAU BAU!

00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.352
It's happening very soon, too!

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:46.093
We're so excited!

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:48.975
Congratulations, Icomochi-mama!

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.876
Omedetou BAU BAU!

00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:53.818
Yeah, we're really excited!

00:09:53.838 --> 00:09:59.861
It's gonna be going on pretty soon, from July 26th until August 4th.

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:03.083
And it's gonna be at a place called Ikebukuro Tag.

00:10:04.064 --> 00:10:10.068
And there, you know, you can see a lot of MAMA's original illustrations, as well as illustrations of us!

00:10:10.428 --> 00:10:11.469
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:16.230
And other ones mama has done officially for Hatsune Miku as well!

00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:18.491
Awesome ones!

00:10:18.832 --> 00:10:19.952
FUWAMOFRIENDS!

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:28.716
If you happen to be visiting Tokyo, I'd love it if you could go visit Icomochi-mama's exhibition and give her a big BAU BAU!

00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:30.496
Congratulations!

00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:35.558
We wanna go check it out too, but I think our ears and tails moistened a little bit.

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:36.319
Yeah.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:37.499
BAU BAU.

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:41.802
Congratulations Icomochi-mama!

00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:45.684
BAU BAU!

00:10:45.704 --> 00:10:48.905
Icomochi-mama is amazing, right?

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:51.567
Yeah, so beautiful, right?

00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:57.110
Yeah, but you know the ears and tail is a bit hard to hide them, right?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.010
It can't be helped.

00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.031
BAU BAU!

00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:00.872
BAU BAU!

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.113
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:10.076
Recently we had some fun.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.877
We have fun everyday.

00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:14.759
We had some special fun.

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:22.483
We went to a place called Joypolis in Odaiba.

00:11:22.803 --> 00:11:25.044
Ruffians, have you heard of Joypolis before?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.350
Wow.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.131
If you have it!

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.472
We did talk about it last morning.

00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:33.732
Did we talk about it?

00:11:39.554 --> 00:11:40.114
Wow!

00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:41.475
Joy Police!

00:11:42.115 --> 00:11:47.997
It's sort of like if a Sega arcade got married to and then had a child with an amusement party!

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:49.798
We love it so much!

00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:51.738
We went in the past before.

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:55.400
But you know, it feels like the best kind of fever dream you can have.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.040
It really does!

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.182
Yeah, like it shouldn't exist, but it does!

00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:00.943
And you know, we're better off for it.

00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:02.964
Yeah, it's really crazy!

00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:07.327
But FUWAMOCO, it wasn't just us though.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:10.028
We went together with Shiori and Nerissa as well!

00:12:10.108 --> 00:12:13.471
You know, cause we wanted to go again to Joypolis.

00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:17.133
And so we asked Advent if they happened to be free when we were planning it.

00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:19.754
And Shiori and Nerissa were able to go!

00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:32.298
And, uh, actually, up until recently, Joypolis was having a collaboration together with hololive, too!

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:32.919
Yeah!

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:41.481
But, you know, now it's kind of ended, and now they're having the Static Beatle collab with Nenechi, too, so it's a bit different, but the fun is still there!

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:42.681
It's still fun!

00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.742
Yeah, but we were really lucky, so it's amazing timing!

00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:47.843
Amazing timing, we're in for it today.

00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:51.622
We just really wanted to go to Joyfulish!

00:12:51.662 --> 00:12:54.123
Joyfulish is fun!

00:12:54.643 --> 00:13:01.425
You know, as a part of the collab, there's many live shows that happen three times throughout the day.

00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:08.647
And you know, with our senpai, Kuma-senpai, Watame-senpai, Luna-senpai, Kanata-senpai, Suisei-senpai!

00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:11.368
They were really, really cool shows too!

00:13:11.748 --> 00:13:13.149
Kind of like, really close up.

00:13:13.249 --> 00:13:15.069
Almost like you could touch them, but don't touch!

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.969
Don't touch!

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.870
Yeah, you know, so I was like,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.330
Oh!

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.231
Luna-senpai's there!

00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:23.711
Spinning around on stage so fast!

00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:23.972
Wataru!

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:24.372

FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:00.658 --> 00:14:00.998
Gekion.

00:14:18.048 --> 00:14:19.669
We're still really well, right?

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:20.510
We're a team.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.851
I was a team with Shiori.

00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:22.192
Yeah.

00:14:22.852 --> 00:14:23.533
How does it look?

00:14:23.573 --> 00:14:29.518
So you get in the roller coaster and then there's like a rhythm game to different SEGA games and music.

00:14:29.538 --> 00:14:34.281
So you get drivers and then you stop and then you do your rhythm game and you get your score.

00:14:34.362 --> 00:14:37.624
And Fuwawa was too scared so it really, really, really bad.

00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:40.427
And she's like, when is this gonna be the roller coaster part?

00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:45.811
Yeah, you do that a couple times and then it's a rollercoaster!

00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:52.017
Yeah, and the rollercoaster goes right over where all our senpai were performing.

00:14:52.077 --> 00:14:52.538
Yeah.

00:14:52.598 --> 00:14:57.462
And so sometimes there'd just be horrible screams all of a sudden.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.584
Those horrible screams being us two.

00:14:59.604 --> 00:15:04.709
Yeah, but I was with Shiori and Nerissa and Fuwawa.

00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:05.229
Yeah.

00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:06.951
Shiori and I.

00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:09.052
We beat them badly.

00:15:09.092 --> 00:15:11.433
Yeah, Nerissa gave up playing the rhythm game.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.613
She was too busy singing.

00:15:12.793 --> 00:15:13.614
She was singing.

00:15:13.654 --> 00:15:16.875
I was like, Nerissa, you singing over there?

00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:18.316
She knew all the lyrics.

00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:19.376
Yeah.

00:15:19.536 --> 00:15:21.537
It was so much fun.

00:15:21.637 --> 00:15:22.217
Right?

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:23.098
Yeah.

00:15:23.138 --> 00:15:24.758
And we went upside down.

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:25.779
It was difficult.

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:27.480
You went upside down, Moco-chan.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.680
You had your eyes closed, huh?

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.741
No, I had my eyes open.

00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:29.901
What?

00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:31.301
You had your eyes open.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:32.662
I had my eyes open.

00:15:32.722 --> 00:15:33.142
Okay.

00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:34.062
Yeah.

00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:36.263
It was really fun.

00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:36.363
Yeah.

00:15:37.964 --> 00:15:46.208
And, yeah, there was also, you know, another game called... It's not a rollercoaster, but it was scary.

00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:48.529
Called Halfpipe Tokyo.

00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:53.672
And we were in the same team, so me and Nerissa and Moco-chan and Shiori.

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:57.514
And basically, it's like, you have to stand a skateboard.

00:15:57.734 --> 00:15:59.875
And it's like a halfpipe.

00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:02.596
And then in the middle, there's like a white line.

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:03.477
It's a music game again.

00:16:03.497 --> 00:16:03.797
Yeah.

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:04.517
It's a music game.

00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:06.318
There's a white line and you have to step.

00:16:06.698 --> 00:16:08.579
You have to step with your two feet.

00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:10.901
As close as you can, but climb it together.

00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:11.261
Yeah.

00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:12.822
So you have to work as a team.

00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:13.222
Yeah.

00:16:13.242 --> 00:16:14.883
And you've gotta aim for the limit break.

00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:16.704
Yeah, it's like a standing roller coaster.

00:16:16.924 --> 00:16:17.464
Yeah.

00:16:17.684 --> 00:16:21.386
But you aim for the white line, which is the limit break, which gets you the most points.

00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:23.867
Yeah, and then you- The limit break is like spins!

00:16:23.887 --> 00:16:24.608
It spins a lot.

00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:25.088
Yeah.

00:16:25.508 --> 00:16:29.569
And Shiori and Moco-chan, you're like, okay, we're gonna get over 10,000.

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:31.310
We're gonna get a high score.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.891
If you get the high score of 10,000, then you get something good, and I don't know what that is, so I wanna know what it is.

00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:36.151
Right.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:41.772
And we saw the other employees who are running it, they look at everybody's scores at the end and they laugh.

00:16:42.312 --> 00:16:45.773
So we're like, we're not gonna be the ones they're laughing at.

00:16:46.253 --> 00:16:48.554
And Nerissa and I were like, okay, like, wait.

00:16:48.914 --> 00:16:51.617
Got told how to do it, the instructions are all good.

00:16:51.737 --> 00:16:53.278
I think we're pretty good at this.

00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:55.881
We're gonna beat Moco-chan and Shiori!

00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:58.823
And then as soon as it started, I started screaming.

00:16:58.883 --> 00:17:00.224
I was like, no, no, no, no!

00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:02.306
No, I'm not gonna beat the new thing!

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:03.067
No, I'm not!

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:03.948
Yeah.

00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:15.378
Shiori and I were doing so well, but once we started getting the limit break in a row, it'd be like... And I keep on going faster and spinning more and more.

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:15.959
Yeah.

00:17:16.696 --> 00:17:19.218
What was your score in the end, Moco-chan?

00:17:19.618 --> 00:17:21.540
I don't even know. 7,000?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.801
No, it wasn't that good.

00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:24.282
Nerissa and I had about 4,000.

00:17:24.322 --> 00:17:26.604
I think it was like 6,500.

00:17:26.724 --> 00:17:30.728
Yeah, they have the scores afterwards, too.

00:17:30.768 --> 00:17:31.088
Yeah.

00:17:31.108 --> 00:17:31.728
Yeah.

00:17:31.748 --> 00:17:35.311
It was really intense, it was fun!

00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:37.013
Yeah, we're all sort of dizzy.

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:37.453
Yeah.

00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:43.098
And then they had a house of the dead game!

00:17:43.398 --> 00:17:46.840
It was really fun because usually house of the dead is like two people only, right?

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.081
You just shoot the zombies.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:51.063
This time it was a bunch of teams, you know?

00:17:51.684 --> 00:17:53.405
It was four teams of four.

00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:54.366
Yeah.

00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:58.309
But so we could battle the zombies together.

00:17:58.329 --> 00:17:59.229
All together!

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:06.214
But at the end, they sort of total up the teams and do which team was the best and who was the best player.

00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:06.635
Yeah.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.516
Ruffians!

00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:10.598
Ruffians!

00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:12.140
Be proud of me.

00:18:13.361 --> 00:18:16.143
I was number one out of everyone in the game.

00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:16.964
But!

00:18:17.284 --> 00:18:17.605
But!

00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:20.568
I was number three for the day.

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:24.071
Third best player of the day.

00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:25.372
Wow.

00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:27.414
I was pretty good.

00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:28.975
I got second at one point.

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.444
It was the end of the game.

00:18:32.584 --> 00:18:35.107
Yeah, it was the end for the day.

00:18:35.187 --> 00:18:36.688
Nerissa almost died.

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:38.530
I didn't get bitten at all.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.972
It wasn't like it was the beginning of the game.

00:18:43.297 --> 00:18:44.978
Yeah.

00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:48.601
And then, what else did we do?

00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:51.803
That's right, there was a place, a thing called Murder Lodge.

00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:57.626
And FUWAMOCO didn't go in it, but it's not because we're just big scaredy cats.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:18:59.688
It's because the line was long.

00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:02.229
They're like, oh, we need two more people.

00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:04.711
And then Shiori and Nerissa were like, oh, that's us!

00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:08.593
Yeah, they said it was like a spooky ASMR experience.

00:19:09.574 --> 00:19:11.175
Yeah, we didn't hear much more than that.

00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:14.168
It really was scary.

00:19:14.268 --> 00:19:17.955
I think it wasn't as scary because it was all in Japanese, maybe?

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:18.836
Maybe.

00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:19.597
Maybe.

00:19:19.718 --> 00:19:20.359
Maybe.

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.160
Maybe.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.601
Yeah.

00:19:23.047 --> 00:19:26.410
And then... Okay, this is the big thing.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.170
Yeah.

00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:33.375
We remember this from last time, but there's a thing in Joypolis called Fortune Forest.

00:19:33.415 --> 00:19:34.276
Fortune Forest.

00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:36.237
And we remember the Fortune Forest.

00:19:36.397 --> 00:19:45.544
Fortune Forest is basically like a fortune forest that you go into, you get like a special gem, and then you have to take your gem and it does like a personality test.

00:19:45.564 --> 00:19:46.865
Yeah, a personality test.

00:19:46.945 --> 00:19:47.906
It shouldn't be that fun.

00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:51.469
And it's also like you can do it individually or you can do it as like a couple.

00:19:51.489 --> 00:19:51.869
A couple.

00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:52.489
Yeah.

00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:55.430
Yeah, I can remember it!

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.451
It's hard to forget this one.

00:19:58.551 --> 00:20:00.412
And you know they have it in English too!

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:09.495
So basically you have to put in your name, and then they ask you, do you want like a fortune based on like your personality?

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.496
Yourself?

00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:11.976
Or your career?

00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:12.136
Romance?

00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:18.648
Now talk to us.

00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:21.190
It's so interesting.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.272
Aren't those two categories kind of similar?

00:20:24.372 --> 00:20:24.853
I don't know.

00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:29.796
What do you think FUWAMOCO picked, Ruffians?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.271
Well, it doesn't really matter in the end.

00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:38.212
We're not going to read all the fortunes.

00:20:38.272 --> 00:20:38.812
No!

00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:43.254
But if you go to Fortune Forest, you'll find out they can be pretty wild.

00:20:43.274 --> 00:20:45.435
Pretty, pretty wild.

00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:49.037
So we had a really, really good laugh at all the fortunes afterwards.

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:49.637
Yeah!

00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:51.338
Because they're all in English too.

00:20:51.438 --> 00:20:52.839
Yeah, somehow they're very accurate.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.893
I think Shiori's wasn't accurate, is what Shiori was saying.

00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:58.956
I feel like it's me-ish.

00:20:58.976 --> 00:21:00.918
We read them though, it's sort of ish.

00:21:01.318 --> 00:21:03.080
Some of it was weird.

00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:04.742
A lot of it was weird.

00:21:04.902 --> 00:21:11.450
Okay, so you have your gel and then you have to take it off.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.771
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:36.905 --> 00:21:40.666
We watched many couples go up.

00:21:59.632 --> 00:22:02.213
And there was maybe one or two that was a GO AWAY!

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:04.673
FUWAMOCO was also a GO AWAY!

00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:07.154
We tried many times, many combinations.

00:22:07.514 --> 00:22:08.615
Nerissa Mococo.

00:22:08.955 --> 00:22:09.695
FUWAMOCO.

00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:11.115
Shiori Nerissa.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.216
Nerissa Fuwawa.

00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:14.336
Shiori Fuwawa.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.396
Shiori Mococo.

00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:16.857
And we made a lot of people leave.

00:22:17.317 --> 00:22:19.798
But we just couldn't get it to win.

00:22:19.938 --> 00:22:21.618
And Nerissa was losing her mind!

00:22:21.698 --> 00:22:23.439
She was losing it!

00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:24.459
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:26.720
I need to get into this cave!

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.582
I can't leave Japan!

00:22:28.842 --> 00:22:30.143
I need to go!

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:31.544
Before I go!

00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:33.826
I'm definitely not going to get into it!

00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:37.328
Because the worst part about it, Ruffians... You can see there's something in there.

00:22:37.348 --> 00:22:39.350
You can see, you can see in the cave.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.111
But you can't get in the cave.

00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:43.253
It's just blocked off just a little.

00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:44.113
Yeah.

00:22:44.293 --> 00:22:51.659
So, Ruffians... So Nerissa... She made a search up online.

00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:53.840
Wait to be able to get into it.

00:22:55.483 --> 00:22:58.786
So we made a- After we went through it, we had a really fun time.

00:22:58.806 --> 00:23:03.009
We were like, okay Nerissa's like, I have to go back to FUWAMOCO, so... Yeah!

00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:04.370
We kind of searched up online.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.771
At first we tried searching in English.

00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:06.631
There's nothing in English.

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.372
There's nothing in English.

00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:09.973
And then she's like, FUWAMOCO, please find out in Japanese.

00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:13.176
So then, we searched it up and we found a walkthrough, guys.

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.157
But it's not easy though.

00:23:15.217 --> 00:23:17.658
It's not easy, it's based on somebody's drawings.

00:23:17.678 --> 00:23:19.399
Which stones you have to pick.

00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:20.559
There's a bunch of different stones.

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:22.120
You have to pick them in a certain order.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.721
The certain right ones with the right partner.

00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:27.122
Both partners have to get a certain stone.

00:23:27.222 --> 00:23:30.303
Yeah, so it's really really really... Cheater!

00:23:30.363 --> 00:23:31.364
It's not cheating!

00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:31.864
No!

00:23:31.884 --> 00:23:31.924
No!

00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:34.745
We need to discover the mystery, okay?

00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:36.046
No, it's a cat!

00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:38.487
She can't leave Japan, okay?

00:23:38.507 --> 00:23:40.028
She's like, it's gonna keep me up.

00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:46.212
So then, Moco-chan, you and Nerissa, you carefully, carefully chose the stones.

00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:50.555
And you're like, okay, I think this is the one we need to get.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:51.335
Yeah.

00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:53.677
And then, you held hands.

00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:54.257
Yeah.

00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:57.299
And then, it said we could go in.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:57.939
Yeah.

00:23:57.959 --> 00:23:59.420
And I was talking with them.

00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:01.542
And we were like, yeah, we can go in!

00:24:01.622 --> 00:24:04.144
Yeah, we felt like we were bragging to everyone there.

00:24:04.164 --> 00:24:05.965
Yeah, everyone was like, look at us!

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:07.946
We can go in!

00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:08.506
Yeah.

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:09.027
And,

00:24:09.775 --> 00:24:15.440
I don't want to spoil it, but... It was amazing in there!

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.823
You have to do your best, Ruffians, to be able to get into Fenya's cave.

00:24:20.263 --> 00:24:24.527
But then afterwards, Nerissa was so happy, she's like, We did it!

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:25.407
We did it!

00:24:25.427 --> 00:24:27.349
I can't believe we got into the cave!

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:28.570
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.910
It was worth it.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:30.851
It was worth it.

00:24:31.492 --> 00:24:32.733
Definitely, definitely.

00:24:33.173 --> 00:24:38.258
But, you know, because of the collab, it was printed on special paper.

00:24:38.438 --> 00:24:44.424
Yeah, so we have pretty wild fortunes on paper with our senpai's faces on it.

00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:47.861
Yeah!

00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:49.302
Yeah!

00:24:50.102 --> 00:24:52.423
Yeah, Nerissa was so, so happy!

00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:53.163
Yeah!

00:24:53.223 --> 00:24:55.064
She was jumping up and down.

00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:56.485
Yeah.

00:24:56.525 --> 00:24:58.345
Fortune Force is very wild.

00:24:58.966 --> 00:24:59.926
It takes, yeah.

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:02.387
You can do it once, or you can do it twice or three times.

00:25:02.427 --> 00:25:03.647
We've done it many, many times.

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:04.508
It's so fun.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:05.288
It's always fun.

00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:05.648
Yeah.

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:08.830
Cause you know, you can ask for so many different things, like fortune yourself.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.310
Yeah.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:09.710
Career.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.191
Romance.

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:18.675
Yeah, Nerissa was like, if I was a kid, this would be the kind of thing that I write stories about.

00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:21.036
It's just really fun.

00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:22.617
It's really fun, yeah.

00:25:24.518 --> 00:25:27.600
Yeah, and then we went on this ride called Wild River.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.441
It was pretty wild.

00:25:30.363 --> 00:25:31.344
It was pretty wild.

00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:32.164
Yeah.

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:35.146
We tried also the, what's it, the Mystic Mansion?

00:25:35.186 --> 00:25:39.689
Yeah, it was like a Japanese themed haunted house kind of 3D, 4D show.

00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:45.272
It was pretty cool, but there was one point there was like a fire, a fire ghost.

00:25:45.472 --> 00:25:47.353
And we were like, where's the ice ghost?

00:25:47.954 --> 00:25:50.615
It got really hot in there, it's so hot!

00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:53.137
It was already hot to begin with!

00:25:53.497 --> 00:25:55.218
Show us the ice ghost, please!

00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:56.959
It never came out, huh?

00:25:57.259 --> 00:25:57.600
No.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.061
Yeah.

00:25:59.161 --> 00:26:00.944
What else was there?

00:26:01.024 --> 00:26:01.124
Oh!

00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:05.029
There was... Ruffians, you know Dip n' Dots.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.293
You know the ice cream that's dots.

00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:09.576
Dip n' Dots.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.272
FUWAMOCO, we really like Dippin' Dots, right?

00:26:13.352 --> 00:26:15.274
Advent, I think we really like Dippin' Dots.

00:26:15.394 --> 00:26:15.754
Yeah.

00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:21.299
And all our senpai had their own special collab Dippin' Dots!

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:23.300
So, we ordered them all.

00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:24.121
We ordered them all.

00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:26.543
And we shared them all together!

00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:27.944
Yeah, that was like $50.

00:26:28.305 --> 00:26:28.425
What?

00:26:28.445 --> 00:26:28.925
$50 of Dippin' Dots.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.211
Yeah, and to make it worse, FUWAMOCO didn't have any money.

00:26:38.851 --> 00:26:42.471
So does Shiori, but... Shiori, can you lend us money?

00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:47.052
Shiori's lent us about... She passed us around thousand yen, ten dollars.

00:26:47.452 --> 00:26:51.513
And I'm like, ah, I'm sorry, Shiori, it's gonna be about five times that.

00:26:52.093 --> 00:26:52.353
Yeah!

00:26:52.373 --> 00:26:56.674
Well, we paid her back, though, right?

00:26:57.614 --> 00:26:57.874
Yes.

00:26:58.274 --> 00:26:58.534
Yes.

00:26:58.694 --> 00:26:58.874
Right?

00:26:59.474 --> 00:26:59.695
Yes.

00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:01.595
I can't remember.

00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:04.807
Yeah, and we shared it!

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:07.611
We all fought over Luna Senpai!

00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:09.434
That was the yummiest, right?

00:27:09.514 --> 00:27:13.800
And we all shared the special goods that came with it.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.045
Yeah, and Nerissa was like, ah, Suisei Senpai's is mine.

00:27:20.788 --> 00:27:26.972
For other collab foods check out Moco-chan and I'm Reshed with Tsuruse-senpai's Churro!

00:27:26.992 --> 00:27:29.733
It was like a churro that was very blue.

00:27:29.813 --> 00:27:31.274
But it's salt caramel flavor.

00:27:31.354 --> 00:27:32.175
Oh, salt caramel?

00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:32.515
Oh!

00:27:32.535 --> 00:27:33.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:36.237
I just tasted the blue flavor.

00:27:36.897 --> 00:27:39.900
And then we had Towa-senpai's drink too!

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.244
And I think Nerissa got a Canaluna Parfait.

00:27:44.845 --> 00:27:46.767
And she let me have the first bite.

00:27:47.547 --> 00:27:49.349
Apparently I took too big of a bite.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.812
She's like, whoa Fuwawa!

00:27:51.832 --> 00:27:54.374
Did it color your tongue?

00:27:54.514 --> 00:27:55.075
I think so.

00:27:55.295 --> 00:27:56.736
I think so probably.

00:27:57.717 --> 00:28:01.498
Yeah, and then there was like a spin the ball attraction.

00:28:01.558 --> 00:28:03.338
Yeah, but like a watery.

00:28:03.818 --> 00:28:05.879
Nerissa and I tried it and we both lost.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.759
Yeah, we just got a piece of paper.

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:10.540
Yeah, but a cute piece of paper.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.460
With Watame-senpai on it.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.121
Right.

00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:19.242
And there was a big air hockey table for four players!

00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:20.802
So we could all play together.

00:28:21.602 --> 00:28:23.484
We played air hockey!

00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:34.030
They had two different ones, like a traditional air hockey, which is very serious, and then like a free-for-all air hockey where there's a bunch of air hockeys.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.791
Yeah.

00:28:35.451 --> 00:28:36.132
We lost both.

00:28:37.613 --> 00:28:39.274
But we were very serious about it.

00:28:39.454 --> 00:28:42.716
I don't know, I just think that Shiori and Nerissa's teamwork was too good.

00:28:43.982 --> 00:28:44.843
BAU BAU Twins.

00:28:44.943 --> 00:28:45.743
Moco-chan.

00:28:45.783 --> 00:28:47.544
But Nerissa would grab the puck.

00:28:48.024 --> 00:28:49.665
And then she would set it up for Shiori.

00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:52.087
That's cheating, right?

00:28:52.707 --> 00:28:53.407
Typical.

00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:54.148
Cheating!

00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:58.910
Yo, what else did we do?

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.231
That was really fun.

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.092
We went to Odaiba.

00:29:02.232 --> 00:29:03.374
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:29:18.708 --> 00:29:19.929
Shiori and Fuwawa.

00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:23.510
And then Nerissa and I, we went and had takoyaki.

00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:25.571
But it was not very good.

00:29:25.792 --> 00:29:27.032
That's what you get.

00:29:27.052 --> 00:29:29.954
But they had like a rope for us.

00:29:30.574 --> 00:29:35.496
And it was kind of in a loop, so at first I was like, I want to be really close to you, Shiori!

00:29:35.596 --> 00:29:36.297
Okay!

00:29:36.677 --> 00:29:37.817
Don't go for me!

00:29:38.157 --> 00:29:42.800
So then I tied the rope around the two of us, so we're kind of like a train.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.121
But then I thought, "that could be dangerous."

00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:47.002
So then we undid that.

00:29:47.282 --> 00:29:51.565
And we held hands, and I made sure that the rope was going through our hands together.

00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:51.665
What?

00:29:51.685 --> 00:29:55.268
Yeah, so it was like... It was like this, Moco-chan.

00:29:55.288 --> 00:29:57.389
Right?

00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:58.110
Yeah.

00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:01.772
And I was really scared.

00:30:02.653 --> 00:30:11.819
And... We made it through there, but we're holding hands the whole time, and Shiori's like, "it's okay, Fuwawa, let's sing a song."

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:14.361
What are we singing first?

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:21.028
You told me this song, but I can't remember.

00:30:23.597 --> 00:30:26.718
I singed "Bad Apple."

00:30:50.623 --> 00:30:52.627
Shiori's like, we have to go backwards.

00:30:52.707 --> 00:30:54.511
I'm like, no we're not going backwards!

00:30:54.932 --> 00:30:57.357
This has to be, this has to be the way!

00:30:57.377 --> 00:31:00.503
And yeah, we just weren't opening the door properly.

00:31:02.682 --> 00:31:04.423
...

00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:30.011
There's so many things to do in Odaiba!

00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:36.217
We went to a dagashiya, which is like a place that sells a whole bunch of Japanese sweets!

00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:37.718
You know, like little ones!

00:31:37.738 --> 00:31:42.963
They'll have like little things of gum that kids could buy with their... Like 50 yen.

00:31:43.063 --> 00:31:45.646
Yeah, with okozuka, with their allowance!

00:31:45.706 --> 00:31:47.368
So it'd be really cheap!

00:31:48.148 --> 00:31:51.950
And, you know, we're like, "Nerissa, Shiori, buy whatever you want!"

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.011
But Nerissa's just hungry.

00:31:53.031 --> 00:31:53.951
She's like, I want food.

00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:54.732
I don't want snacks.

00:31:54.852 --> 00:31:55.732
I want food.

00:31:56.273 --> 00:31:58.934
Yeah, so she didn't get anything, but that's her fault.

00:31:59.354 --> 00:32:00.995
And then Shiori got some stuff.

00:32:01.015 --> 00:32:01.655
Yay!

00:32:01.715 --> 00:32:03.036
And we paid for it all.

00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:03.817
Yeah!

00:32:03.897 --> 00:32:07.258
And we also made a bit of a dream of ours come true.

00:32:07.278 --> 00:32:07.338
Yeah!

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:09.300
Because we spent over.. 10000 yen, 100 dollars.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:16.822
We bought so much candy, you know we're adults.

00:32:16.862 --> 00:32:18.242
Growing up puppies.

00:32:28.964 --> 00:32:31.187
We have a lot of snacks.

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:37.096
And I found a new one that I really like.

00:32:37.176 --> 00:32:39.579
It's like dried pickle plums.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:41.642
They're really yummy.

00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:44.686
How heavy was it?

00:32:44.746 --> 00:32:45.606
It was heavy.

00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:46.527
Yeah.

00:32:46.847 --> 00:32:47.868
It was amazing.

00:32:48.328 --> 00:32:49.769
Yeah, it was a really big bag.

00:32:49.869 --> 00:32:56.374
Yeah, I think the issue was, is that we were shopping separately.

00:32:56.394 --> 00:33:01.557
Yeah, Moco-chan and I, so if Moco-chan saw something and she's like, "oh, I'm curious about that."

00:33:01.577 --> 00:33:02.358
"I wanna try this."

00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:06.981
Yeah, and then I would come by and be like, "oh, I'm curious about this."

00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:09.543
Maybe Moco-chan would like one too, so that I put...

00:33:10.663 --> 00:33:15.166
And then we ended up buying the same ones over and over.

00:33:15.246 --> 00:33:15.706
Yeah.

00:33:16.487 --> 00:33:16.767
Yeah.

00:33:16.807 --> 00:33:19.829
So instead of two, we'd end up buying four.

00:33:20.189 --> 00:33:21.049
Yeah.

00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:21.149
Yeah.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.551
That was the problem.

00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:25.192
It's just so many!

00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:28.234
I wanted to kind of run everywhere and take a look at everything.

00:33:28.294 --> 00:33:29.554
I wanted to try them.

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:29.794
Right.

00:33:29.814 --> 00:33:31.375
So much stuff I've never tried.

00:33:31.495 --> 00:33:31.976
Right.

00:33:31.996 --> 00:33:32.156
Yeah.

00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:34.157
Yeah, we got lots of duplicates.

00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:41.824
Yeah, and then I was like, oh, Shiori should try this one, and this one, and this one, and this one, and this one!

00:33:41.844 --> 00:33:42.004
Yeah.

00:33:42.024 --> 00:33:44.887
So I was just giving her all of the snacks.

00:33:45.307 --> 00:33:47.029
The snacks are gonna last forever.

00:33:47.189 --> 00:33:47.509
Right?

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:48.330
Yeah.

00:33:49.351 --> 00:33:50.432
It was really fun.

00:33:50.632 --> 00:33:59.361
We just had so much fun, and you know, we got to read minds together, and just chat about a bunch of things, and be silly, and... No, but soon I will...

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:00.882
I don't know why.

00:34:00.902 --> 00:34:03.443
We were like, "oh I'm gonna hit you with my hair!"

00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:04.904
"I'm gonna hit you with my hair!"

00:34:05.284 --> 00:34:06.525
And then we bonked heads.

00:34:07.305 --> 00:34:10.627
That's just how things are.

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:11.147
Yeah.

00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:12.988
It's just silly.

00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:15.290
It was really, really fun.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.331
We had a good day, right?

00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:18.171
Yeah.

00:34:19.092 --> 00:34:20.373
That's just how things are.

00:34:20.393 --> 00:34:20.473
Yeah.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:30.015
And that was our fun day at Joypolis!

00:34:30.436 --> 00:34:31.737
Did we get any souvenirs?

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:34.479
I got a souvenir actually!

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.281
Because it was a really cute crane game.

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:41.204
And it had like an octopus, like a strap, like a keychain in it.

00:34:41.624 --> 00:34:46.028
And I really wanted it, but Moco-chan wouldn't give me any money to be able to play it.

00:34:46.488 --> 00:34:48.850
So Shiori played it and won me one!

00:34:51.512 --> 00:34:54.054
Yeah, so that was my souvenir.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.316
Yeah, it's so cute!

00:34:56.676 --> 00:34:57.997
It's very, very cute.

00:34:58.657 --> 00:34:59.158
Yeah.

00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:00.158
Nice.

00:35:00.499 --> 00:35:01.439
It's with us, huh?

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.501
Yeah.

00:35:03.941 --> 00:35:06.983
He's with all the buddy Noah!

00:35:07.584 --> 00:35:08.204
Noah!

00:35:08.224 --> 00:35:09.705
We have fun.

00:35:09.985 --> 00:35:10.606
We have fun.

00:35:10.946 --> 00:35:11.226
Yeah.

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:14.809
And I guess, you know, we have the Fortune Forest Fortunes!

00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:16.610
That's another souvenir!

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.033
And then all the, you know, the special collab items, too!

00:35:21.736 --> 00:35:24.437
And of course, all the memories.

00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:30.080
Definitely, Ruffians, you have to go check out Joypolis.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.661
It's just so much fun!

00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:35.063
Yeah, and there's a bunch of things we weren't able to do either.

00:35:36.604 --> 00:35:37.765
I wanna go again.

00:35:37.785 --> 00:35:38.586
BAU BAU!

00:35:38.606 --> 00:35:46.073
Yeah, and it's indoors too, so it's nice and air-conditioned.

00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:48.395
You can go any kind of weather.

00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:50.057
Yeah, it's fun.

00:35:50.297 --> 00:35:51.098
It's just so fun.

00:35:51.118 --> 00:35:54.822
BAU BAU!

00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:54.922
Yeah!

00:35:54.942 --> 00:35:57.764
It's so good!

00:35:57.784 --> 00:35:57.864
Yeah!

00:35:58.445 --> 00:36:00.047
Wow, Ruffians!

00:36:01.317 --> 00:36:06.041
This week, you know, we have more FUWAMOCO Mornings coming up, but!

00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:13.907
You might have already heard, but FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be going on our first vacation since we debuted!

00:36:14.027 --> 00:36:15.889
BAU BAU!

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:22.374
You know, it's just gonna be a few days that we're away for, but

00:36:23.595 --> 00:36:26.418
It's gonna be a little bit of an adventure, right?

00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:29.500
We're really looking forward to it.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.064
But Ruffians, make sure that we bring back lots of omiyage banashi!

00:36:34.885 --> 00:36:38.528
Souvenir stories for you!

00:36:38.748 --> 00:36:42.991
But because of that, there's not gonna be a FUWAMOCO Morning, obviously.

00:36:43.652 --> 00:36:43.932
But!

00:36:44.392 --> 00:36:44.653
But!

00:36:45.876 --> 00:36:46.336
But!

00:36:47.116 --> 00:36:49.097
We'll be doing a Twitter space, okay?

00:36:49.157 --> 00:36:50.097
At the same time.

00:36:51.278 --> 00:36:52.838
So we hope that you'll join us there!

00:36:53.318 --> 00:36:55.999
And maybe we'll share a bit more adventures so far with you!

00:36:56.099 --> 00:36:56.559
Yeah!

00:36:57.079 --> 00:37:02.521
And FUWAMOCO will also make sure that we have a live chat here on YouTube open!

00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:08.923
And that way, you know, you can chat there, we can chat back with you doing the Twitter space to Ruffians!

00:37:09.743 --> 00:37:10.903
Does that sound good?

00:37:10.983 --> 00:37:13.144
Will the Twitter space have the Pup Talk?

00:37:14.594 --> 00:37:14.874
BAU BAU!

00:37:34.572 --> 00:37:36.653
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:37:36.753 --> 00:37:38.073
I can't believe we talked this much.

00:37:38.133 --> 00:37:38.753
Oh my gosh.

00:37:39.813 --> 00:37:39.934
Hi.

00:37:40.034 --> 00:37:42.174
Joyful is just out for a drive.

00:37:42.774 --> 00:37:45.615
Well, let's check out who our Doggie of the Day is today.

00:37:45.675 --> 00:37:48.255
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.636
Ginger!

00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:52.376
BAU BAU!

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:52.816
Ginger!

00:37:52.856 --> 00:37:53.156
BAU BAU!

00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:54.557
You're so cuddly.

00:37:54.577 --> 00:37:54.657
Why?

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.352
How does Ginger BAU BAU?

00:38:17.065 --> 00:38:20.888
Just like that, huh?

00:38:21.348 --> 00:38:25.871
Well, you know, Ginger here, Ginger has a big nose for kisses!

00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:30.815
I'll never ever complain if you know maybe they're a bit too enthusiastic!

00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:35.538
I don't think Ginger will complain if you pet him backwards either, right?

00:38:35.558 --> 00:38:35.959
You know it.

00:38:36.259 --> 00:38:38.600
Yeah, no.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.442
Because, you know why, Ruffians?

00:38:42.406 --> 00:38:45.708
Because Ginger is a very well-mannered doggo.

00:38:45.748 --> 00:38:50.331
Just make sure that you give him lots of hugs, okay?

00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:52.713
I think that might be his purpose in life.

00:38:52.753 --> 00:38:53.833
Lots of hugs.

00:38:54.394 --> 00:38:56.735
BAU BAU!

00:38:57.656 --> 00:39:00.758
Next, "I went for a walk" corner.

00:39:00.898 --> 00:39:02.439
"Today I went on a walk" corner.

00:39:02.479 --> 00:39:03.279
That's the name.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.721
We have De-den!

00:39:10.234 --> 00:39:10.734
De-den!

00:39:10.794 --> 00:39:11.395
I love it.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.355
It's so beautiful.

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.056
The red, orange, the butterflies.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.921
Nice butterfly.

00:39:28.141 --> 00:39:35.946
Actually, FUWAMOCO, I saw a big, big red dragonfly.

00:39:35.966 --> 00:39:37.787
I was so surprised.

00:39:37.827 --> 00:39:40.129
You never know what you're gonna find on your rocks, right?

00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:42.551
Yeah, we've been seeing some big butterflies.

00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:48.715
Yeah, just like this, but it was a really, really bright blue, right?

00:39:48.835 --> 00:39:49.896
A dragonfly.

00:39:50.136 --> 00:39:51.056
Yeah.

00:39:51.096 --> 00:39:51.897
Not a dragon.

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:53.038
A dragonfly.

00:39:53.518 --> 00:39:55.839
But we still need to see Cicadas!

00:39:56.619 --> 00:39:58.160
I haven't seen, I've heard of them.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.861
I keep on looking at the trees.

00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:00.721
Where are you?

00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:01.461
Where are you?

00:40:01.501 --> 00:40:02.422
Get down here!

00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:03.422
But not yet.

00:40:03.722 --> 00:40:04.163
Not yet.

00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:04.503
Yeah.

00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:05.363
Yeah.

00:40:05.783 --> 00:40:15.407
But I'm really happy that Ruffians that you like to stop and admire these cool bugs and you know the other things that you see on the days when you go for walks too.

00:40:16.068 --> 00:40:18.209
It makes me feel even closer so.

00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:18.829
Thank you!

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:20.870
Thank you BAU BAU!

00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:26.173
And next for our Question of the Day!

00:40:26.193 --> 00:40:27.974
We got a question from you, Ruffians!

00:40:27.994 --> 00:40:28.794
Let's take a look!

00:40:28.995 --> 00:40:30.896
We have de-den!

00:40:31.316 --> 00:40:33.577
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

00:40:33.677 --> 00:40:38.140
When it's a hot summer day, what is your favorite way to cool down a bit?

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.461
Like drinking some cold water?

00:40:40.782 --> 00:40:42.563
Maybe getting some ice cream?

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:43.923
Do you have any good friends?

00:40:44.364 --> 00:40:46.425
Yeah, the vending machines!

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.591
But right now... FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:58.515
I think we talked about it a bit before, but we really like the taxi at the end of the hot and long days.

00:40:58.575 --> 00:40:59.996
Yeah.

00:41:00.136 --> 00:41:01.236
Taxi.

00:41:01.837 --> 00:41:03.237
It's bad, but... Yeah.

00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:10.561
It's just so nice being so sleepy and everything is dark, but then there's the lights and it's nice and cool.

00:41:11.364 --> 00:41:12.065
Yeah.

00:41:12.725 --> 00:41:13.245
Yeah.

00:41:14.246 --> 00:41:15.287
It's not good though.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.988
It feels like a dreamer though.

00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:17.608
Yeah.

00:41:17.748 --> 00:41:20.590
But we're trying to avoid them, right Moco-chan?

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.371
Yeah.

00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:21.471
Yeah.

00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:25.133
But I also made the salty lychee drinks!

00:41:25.694 --> 00:41:27.795
And shaved ice too!

00:41:28.015 --> 00:41:28.236
Yeah!

00:41:28.416 --> 00:41:31.778
And most importantly, 24-7 air conditioning.

00:41:31.858 --> 00:41:33.199
Air con!

00:41:33.399 --> 00:41:34.000
Yeah.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.241
And the soap tablets too!

00:41:36.281 --> 00:41:36.922
Those are important.

00:41:36.962 --> 00:41:38.603
I guess it doesn't really cool you down.

00:41:39.143 --> 00:41:41.984
Ruffians, make sure you stay cool too, okay?

00:41:42.004 --> 00:41:43.885
And don't forget sunscreen, okay?

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.931
BAU BAU!

00:41:56.971 --> 00:42:00.736
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:42:00.776 --> 00:42:04.860
Thank you for always wanting to be a part of

00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:14.770
FUWAMOCO Morning here with us.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:20.551
We're always looking for more questions, more submissions, more Pero Sightings!

00:42:20.851 --> 00:42:23.792
Please let us know with the hashtag!

00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:26.613
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:42:26.813 --> 00:42:27.473
Okay!

00:42:27.973 --> 00:42:28.754
BAU BAU!

00:42:28.854 --> 00:42:30.854
I see a misunderstanding already.

00:42:31.034 --> 00:42:31.914
A misunderstanding?

00:42:32.315 --> 00:42:35.435
You don't have to pay an extra fee for the air conditioning.

00:42:35.496 --> 00:42:36.776
You're so obvious!

00:42:37.216 --> 00:42:39.317
But it's all included, don't you think?

00:42:39.717 --> 00:42:39.857
But...

00:42:42.856 --> 00:42:44.878
I'm paying for the tires, too.

00:42:44.898 --> 00:42:44.978
Yeah.

00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:48.602
It's not an extra fee for the tires!

00:42:48.702 --> 00:42:50.003
Not an extra fee.

00:42:50.043 --> 00:42:52.545
But... I had to wait!

00:42:52.605 --> 00:42:54.387
Don't worry!

00:42:54.407 --> 00:42:55.788
I saw it coming.

00:42:55.808 --> 00:42:59.091
I love you!

00:42:59.131 --> 00:43:01.033
BAU BAU!

00:43:01.414 --> 00:43:03.375
BAU BAU!

00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:07.199
Ooh, well, we have another stream coming up, Moco-chan!

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:07.940
In a little bit.

00:43:09.435 --> 00:43:11.796

00:43:11.836 --> 00:43:13.277

00:43:17.259 --> 00:43:19.000
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:43:34.028 --> 00:43:36.090
We're super excited.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.392
I can't wait for the songs we're gonna sing together.

00:43:38.492 --> 00:43:39.894
This is gonna be really fun.

00:43:40.214 --> 00:43:41.275
A lot of us.

00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:44.058
So we hope you'll join us, Ruffians.

00:43:44.538 --> 00:43:48.382
It'll be on our channel here, and it will be archived.

00:43:48.973 --> 00:43:52.555
So that the memories always stay.

00:43:53.076 --> 00:43:59.940
And then also, it's important to mention, but that's not our first year anniversary celebration!

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:05.083
We'll be doing that on the 28th on Sunday, and that will also be an old collab!

00:44:05.363 --> 00:44:10.427
We're doing some really fun things and maybe have some exciting things too!

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:12.568
So you have to join us there!

00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:14.589

00:44:14.789 --> 00:44:18.352
We also have a Super Mario World endurance as well for our personality!

00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:23.195
So, let's have a fun time.

00:44:24.315 --> 00:44:28.018
I think we're aiming to make it the longest stream ever for us so far.

00:44:28.218 --> 00:44:29.939
We'll see how it goes!

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:31.960
If we beat the game, then it's done.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:32.601
It's done.

00:44:33.201 --> 00:44:34.001
Can't do much more.

00:44:34.742 --> 00:44:35.923
BAU BAU!

00:44:36.623 --> 00:44:43.667
And for the Ruffians who are joining us to the archive today, here is your FUWAMOCO word!

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:46.449
It's BAU BAU Vacation!
