During their last [Resident Evil 4 stream](https://youtu.be/nrMfq4OknXU), FUWAMOCO seemed determined to commit violence against some scary grandmas and grandpas. Of course, they advise against doing so in real life! Respect your elders.

Mococo shares that even when the heat is up, her toes feel constantly cold and when possible, she uses a foot warmer.

[@splinteredpizza](https://twitter.com/splinteredpizza/status/1709665980157133278) takes a walk up late in the evening. FUWAMOCO seem concerned about this Ruffian's safety.

## ❓ Question Of The Day ([26:29](https://youtu.be/Tu6QNPp9d3c?t=26m29s))

[Wushsuh](https://twitter.com/WuhsuhBen/status/1709635468134871321) is curious about FUWAMOCO's figure collection. The sisters confess that they haven't collected new ones in a while. They recall that they were less expensive back in the day and now they take longer to arrive after they are just first announced.
