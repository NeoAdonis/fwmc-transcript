07:03.919 --> 07:07.700
BAU BAU!

07:08.841 --> 07:10.922
Oh, you missed episode 94.

07:11.062 --> 07:13.003
What do you mean you missed episode 94?

07:13.063 --> 07:14.563
Where the BAU BAU gone gone?

07:14.583 --> 07:16.064
There's a secret ruffian.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.183
You can go watch it on YouTube.

07:19.664 --> 07:21.664
If you search up FUWAMOCO channel.

07:22.764 --> 07:24.245
I just heard this, I don't know.

07:24.265 --> 07:26.385
Whenever Mococo hi.

07:27.646 --> 07:28.966
What do you mean Moco-chan?

07:29.006 --> 07:31.226
You were there for the 94th episode.

07:31.306 --> 07:34.887
Missed episode 94, but not Mococo.

07:35.147 --> 07:35.688
What?

07:37.048 --> 07:41.089
Oh, like I missed episode 94, I didn't miss Moco-chan.

07:41.989 --> 07:42.529
Like that?

07:43.570 --> 07:45.150
I don't think that's what they were saying.

07:45.965 --> 07:46.765
You sure?

07:46.785 --> 07:47.185
Yeah.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.706
BAU BAU!

07:49.746 --> 07:52.227
BAU BAU!

07:52.247 --> 07:57.088
It's only been a little bit since we saw you last, right Moco-chan?

07:57.108 --> 07:59.409
I guess you didn't miss me then, huh?

07:59.429 --> 07:59.709
BAU BAU.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.830
Well, I've got bad news for you.

08:10.270 --> 08:13.973
Like, really bad news or are you just saying that because bad news?

08:15.073 --> 08:15.994
It's a bit dangerous.

08:18.295 --> 08:21.137
It's been a Pero Sighting.

08:21.357 --> 08:22.658
Pero is dangerous.

08:24.259 --> 08:25.440
Where was he seen now?

08:25.460 --> 08:31.804
De-den.

08:31.824 --> 08:36.888
That's so Brazil and I guess

08:37.662 --> 08:39.524
The Great Perroccino.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.585
Like I said, it's a bit dangerous.

08:42.046 --> 08:44.007
Yeah.

08:44.047 --> 08:49.392
This looks like maybe the start to an intense battle for the history book.

08:50.072 --> 08:53.315
I don't know though, are they actually gonna fight it out there?

08:53.956 --> 08:58.379
You know, it sort of looks like, you know, maybe they're just happy to have met up?

08:59.060 --> 08:59.600
You know?

08:59.961 --> 09:01.082
Oh, hey Fubucilla.

09:01.282 --> 09:05.225
Maybe they're just ready to bully and smack around Mt.

09:05.245 --> 09:05.405
Fuji.

09:07.879 --> 09:14.064
I don't know, I don't think they can do that.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.125
That's not right.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.387
That's Malfuji.

09:17.407 --> 09:19.008
Malfuji!

09:19.329 --> 09:20.890
Don't bully Malfuji.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.592
You look at it, awe at it.

09:24.072 --> 09:26.454
His beauty and the power.

09:26.534 --> 09:27.776
Don't bully.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.557
Don't bully nicely.

09:29.617 --> 09:30.678
See Malfuji there.

09:33.423 --> 09:34.544
It's so clear!

09:34.564 --> 09:37.345
So crisp!

09:38.465 --> 09:45.548
You know, Mouth Fuji is just... It's so breathtaking, especially on like the clearest day.

09:46.048 --> 09:51.150
While FubuZilla here and Pero... They don't compare.

09:51.910 --> 09:53.471
No matter how big they are.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.272
They don't compare!

09:55.492 --> 09:55.832
They don't.

09:57.438 --> 10:02.341
Yeah, and, uh, maybe, you know, maybe they're like, ah, Mount Fuji's pretty awesome.

10:02.542 --> 10:02.902
Hai!

10:03.322 --> 10:04.203
Nah, it's okay.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.765
Maybe they went and decided to go bully something else.

10:08.165 --> 10:08.486
What?

10:08.786 --> 10:11.608
Yeah, like, Tokyo Tower.

10:11.708 --> 10:12.108
Hai!

10:12.548 --> 10:15.691
Yeah, you know, Tokyo Tower's not as tall as Sky Tree.

10:17.572 --> 10:17.812
Yeah.

10:18.613 --> 10:20.454
Tokyo Tower is a little bit bullyable, no?

10:23.385 --> 10:24.746
BAU BAU!

10:24.826 --> 10:27.689
I hope you're all able to enjoy Mt.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.151
Fuji in peace.

10:30.232 --> 10:33.375
BAU BAU!

10:34.876 --> 10:36.057
I like Tokyo Tower.

10:36.378 --> 10:43.465
If I had to say if I like Tokyo Tower or Sky-Chi better, I'd say Tokyo Tower.

10:43.545 --> 10:44.085
Really?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.828
But Sky-Chi has the marble.

10:48.257 --> 10:48.517
Soramachi.

11:13.232 --> 11:14.753
Ruffians!

11:15.174 --> 11:21.741
We're sure you heard about it, but... Marine-Senchou-Senpai did it again!

11:25.269 --> 11:32.814
She just released an amazing, brand new, original song together with Kobo-senpai.

11:33.074 --> 11:38.177
And of course, in the true Senchou style, it's fully animated.

11:39.117 --> 11:41.299
Did you see it?

11:41.439 --> 11:41.839
Right!

11:41.979 --> 11:43.800
It's amazing.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.062
The song is called "III".

11:47.222 --> 11:48.303
I I I!

11:48.983 --> 11:52.086
Super hot and spicy dance number.

11:52.326 --> 11:54.568
The song is fire, right?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.769
Yeah, it's so trendy, right?

11:56.849 --> 12:02.474
It makes you want to take a 30 second vertical dance video and upload it online, right?

12:03.534 --> 12:05.876
Moco-chan, that's kind of stupid.

12:05.916 --> 12:08.819
Do you have any kind of plans?

12:09.459 --> 12:10.019
No!

12:11.521 --> 12:12.842
I just thought it looked sort of fun.

12:14.902 --> 12:27.514
I don't know, it's a very different feeling and style from Marine-senpai's previous original song, Shinkiro, together with Gura-senpai!

12:28.275 --> 12:35.141
I really like III, but I'm also really really fond of EDC pop and city pop.

12:36.162 --> 12:39.626
I don't know, I just can't help but love Shinkiro so much.

12:39.786 --> 12:43.410
I love the difference between the two!

12:43.490 --> 12:49.657
I listen to Shinkiro non-stop on the way to Japan.

12:49.777 --> 12:52.781
It's really precious to me too now.

12:54.577 --> 13:04.602
Ruffians, you know, when the time comes that you want to maybe spice things up and dance the night away, definitely put on III, okay?

13:04.642 --> 13:06.703
Yeah, please check it out, Ruffians!

13:06.823 --> 13:08.804
BAU BAU!

13:10.765 --> 13:11.466
BAU BAU!

13:11.526 --> 13:11.966
Ruffians!

13:29.966 --> 13:31.808
Are you following us on Twitter?

13:32.809 --> 13:33.169
Are you?

13:33.509 --> 13:34.330
Good question.

13:36.231 --> 13:39.935
Sometimes I see Ruffians tweeting, FUWAMOCO's so cute!

13:40.295 --> 13:42.697
And then I go to see if they're following us and they're not.

13:43.478 --> 13:44.819
What's with that, Ruffians?

13:45.339 --> 13:45.980
Hi!

13:46.801 --> 13:47.341
Hi!

13:47.481 --> 13:47.882
Right!

13:48.582 --> 13:50.924
I've been watching FUWAMOCO for hours!

13:51.785 --> 13:52.906
Look for the tweet, not FUWAMOCO.

13:53.706 --> 13:54.366
Huh?

13:55.467 --> 13:59.308
We were too busy watching, we forgot.

13:59.348 --> 14:00.508
That's what I think.

14:00.568 --> 14:02.629
Why are you following us?

14:02.929 --> 14:05.130
You don't use Twitter, that's okay.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.010
You're following us here, right?

14:07.050 --> 14:08.591
You subscribe to us here, right?

14:08.711 --> 14:10.972
Right!

14:12.072 --> 14:20.055
But if you're following us on Twitter, you might have seen, but we finished all our signing for our birthday

14:21.417 --> 14:21.597
Yeah!

14:21.637 --> 14:22.880
The postcards!

14:23.040 --> 14:26.928
You know, you might have thought that we did them all that day.

14:28.810 --> 14:32.952
We've actually been working on them over the last month together.

14:34.533 --> 14:44.159
It took us a good while, but we put a lot of care and love into each and every one of them.

14:44.179 --> 14:48.061
We kept thinking about how happy you'd be once you get yours.

14:48.081 --> 14:50.422
It made us work really hard.

14:52.143 --> 14:57.704
I kind of would do my signature and be like, aaaah, these are touching, and aaaah.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.845
Yeah.

15:01.065 --> 15:08.326
But I know that I kind of saw some ruffians who were wondering if maybe some have been sneezed on.

15:11.607 --> 15:12.047
Moco-chan.

15:13.867 --> 15:18.488
I can't deny that I do sneeze quite a bit while doing them.

15:20.979 --> 15:22.620
This is normal for me, you know?

15:24.140 --> 15:26.221
So, my Ruffians!

15:26.641 --> 15:36.564
If you're able to get your paws on the limited edition postcard, maybe you guys might have, uh, something a bit extra to it?

15:36.784 --> 15:39.224
Hopefully they smell nice!

15:41.405 --> 15:45.726
We're also being watched over by the Ruffian plushies while we're singing too!

15:45.986 --> 15:48.187
They're so nice!

15:48.727 --> 15:52.330
Big, and comfy, and huggable, and soft!

15:52.730 --> 15:54.471
It's hard, you know.

15:54.491 --> 15:56.072
The chest are so fluffy.

15:56.092 --> 15:56.672
Fluffy.

15:56.893 --> 15:57.993
Fluffy.

15:58.874 --> 15:59.374
Yeah.

16:00.055 --> 16:06.079
Please look forward to our birthday, my chinchinyo, okay, ruffians?

16:06.179 --> 16:06.319
Yeah!

16:06.359 --> 16:09.361
We're really excited for our puppies to reach us soon.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.103
Are they still available to buy?

16:12.123 --> 16:17.206
Unfortunately, it was limited for only a month after our birthday.

16:17.747 --> 16:17.967
But...

16:18.627 --> 16:25.573
Hopefully there'll be more exciting FUWAMOCO merch to come in the future, so we'll make sure to let you know that, okay?

16:25.693 --> 16:34.280
I think you know us, but we really like heroes and mercenaries, so... We hope you'll be excited, okay, Ruffians?

16:34.780 --> 16:37.382
We wanna make nice stuff for you, okay?

16:37.422 --> 16:40.945
BAU BAU!

16:41.766 --> 16:43.047
Exciting!

16:43.367 --> 16:44.628
Right!

16:45.869 --> 16:47.410
Moco-chan and I were very, uh...

16:48.351 --> 16:50.653
We like our pens.

16:50.733 --> 16:55.698
Raise the pens to make the best domestic picture possible.

16:56.218 --> 16:58.280
Sometimes I get the ink everywhere.

16:59.181 --> 16:59.461
Yeah.

16:59.681 --> 17:00.181
No good.

17:01.142 --> 17:02.283
This one's discard.

17:02.844 --> 17:03.224
Yeah.

17:04.085 --> 17:04.505
No good.

17:06.147 --> 17:08.349
BAU BAU!

17:09.590 --> 17:10.671
Ruffians!

17:11.852 --> 17:17.817
I was wondering, have you been a little bit confused at the end of our streams recently?

17:17.837 --> 17:18.718
Maybe.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.543
Has there been something maybe puzzling you a little bit?

17:26.750 --> 17:28.411
This may be... Always!

17:28.691 --> 17:29.131
Always!

17:29.271 --> 17:29.671
Always?

17:29.791 --> 17:32.052
What does that mean?

17:32.272 --> 17:32.752
Always?

17:33.332 --> 17:34.913
We're always confused, huh?

17:35.513 --> 17:35.953
Huh?

17:36.394 --> 17:37.954
What are we doing to confuse you that much, huh?

17:37.974 --> 17:43.476
The idea of things ending is confusing?

17:43.516 --> 17:46.797
That must be it, huh?

17:47.157 --> 17:48.898
It's confusing when it ends, huh?

17:49.618 --> 17:51.579
That's what it is, though.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.239
Okay!

17:52.979 --> 17:53.720
What it is!

17:53.900 --> 17:54.280
Not that.

17:55.285 --> 18:07.152
You know, recently, we've been shouting out to ruffians joining us by watching the archive of our streams by sharing with them a special FUWAMOCO word!

18:07.192 --> 18:08.533
Yeah!

18:08.553 --> 18:09.834
Oh, you know it!

18:10.054 --> 18:12.335
What do they do with the FUWAMOCO word?

18:13.396 --> 18:15.057
You can post it in the comments.

18:15.597 --> 18:16.518
Yeah!

18:16.858 --> 18:21.741
But I think maybe that there's some ruffians who don't really

18:23.109 --> 18:23.889
Understand.

18:24.029 --> 18:25.230
Didn't get the message.

18:25.350 --> 18:27.731
Yeah, maybe a little bit lost.

18:28.151 --> 18:38.515
So we wanted to explain that, you know, the FUWAMOCO word is simply just something that you can comment to let us know that you enjoyed the stream after we were live.

18:38.915 --> 18:45.138
And also, you know, it gives a FUWAMOCO, a channel here, a little bit of a boost too.

18:45.198 --> 18:47.718
A little bit of a push.

18:48.079 --> 18:48.939
It gives us a push.

18:49.542 --> 18:50.183
Hi!

18:51.084 --> 18:53.246
We love getting your comments so much, you know.

18:53.266 --> 18:58.953
We understand that you're busy too, so maybe you don't know what to say.

18:58.973 --> 19:03.518
But if you really want to comment something, here you go!

19:03.758 --> 19:06.201
FUWAMOCO!

19:07.082 --> 19:07.202
Hi!

19:07.242 --> 19:08.824
Ruffians, you know, even though

19:10.712 --> 19:15.977
We're just really happy and so thankful to have you here supporting and watching us always.

19:27.748 --> 19:30.770
Yeah, we're always looking to the comments!

19:31.410 --> 19:32.931
Thank you, ruffians!

19:33.031 --> 19:33.631
Thank you!

19:33.711 --> 19:35.432
BAU BAU!

19:35.672 --> 19:37.133
Moco-chan, that was it.

19:37.453 --> 19:45.297
I saw, you know, on a recent stream, there was a ruffian who left a really, really nice long comment.

19:45.737 --> 19:49.439
I was like, okay, it's okay because FUWAMOCO's not gonna see this.

19:50.359 --> 19:50.859
I saw it.

19:53.927 --> 19:58.849
Sometimes there's a lot of you that say, oh it's okay, FUWAMOCO will never see that.

19:58.870 --> 19:59.270
Right!

19:59.370 --> 19:59.930
Right!

20:00.170 --> 20:01.251
I'm like, ha!

20:01.291 --> 20:02.612
That's so interesting!

20:02.652 --> 20:03.552
Why would you say that?

20:03.592 --> 20:05.554
Don't think we'll see it, huh?

20:05.634 --> 20:06.874
Why would you think that?

20:06.914 --> 20:07.315
Yeah.

20:09.496 --> 20:12.658
If you say that, we'll see it.

20:13.038 --> 20:15.079
If you don't say that, we'll see it.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.120
Yeah.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.256
Thank you Ruffians!

20:20.376 --> 20:22.098
As for today's FUWAMOCO run, well...

20:35.211 --> 20:36.912
You have to wait, it's not that time yet.

20:37.132 --> 20:37.452
No!

20:37.933 --> 20:40.194
BAU BAU!

20:40.214 --> 20:44.437
BAU BAU!

20:45.317 --> 20:49.400
As you can see, we have nothing.

20:50.816 --> 20:50.956
Hi!

20:50.996 --> 20:52.277
Ruffians!

20:52.777 --> 21:00.581
Wasn't it the other day we talked about how we had cup noodles for the first time, right?

21:00.701 --> 21:03.763
From Koyori-senpai!

21:03.783 --> 21:05.024
We really liked them!

21:05.064 --> 21:07.865
I know, they're nice and warm on my throat.

21:09.006 --> 21:13.548
Well, we still had a few left, so I had one the other day!

21:14.469 --> 21:18.691
And I... well... There was a problem.

21:21.078 --> 21:25.499
To tell the truth, I haven't been very hungry recently.

21:25.519 --> 21:30.220
So it's been taking me a while to eat things.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.961
I think I was a bit lost in thought while I was eating.

21:36.001 --> 21:38.181
Because I went to place it down on the table.

21:38.201 --> 21:40.722
But I missed.

21:41.762 --> 21:46.363
And my noodles accidentally fell over the floor.

21:48.083 --> 21:48.423
How sad.

21:51.383 --> 21:52.123
All the noodles!

21:53.164 --> 21:54.024
Everywhere!

21:55.986 --> 21:57.326
They looked like they were crying.

21:57.686 --> 21:58.767
The noodles were crying?

21:58.807 --> 22:00.028
The noodles were crying!

22:00.068 --> 22:01.929
You didn't see a reflection of yourself?

22:02.009 --> 22:03.309
No, I did not cry!

22:04.430 --> 22:05.691
I did not cry!

22:07.251 --> 22:08.832
No crying over spilled noodles.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.113
You know, they wanted to be eaten!

22:14.833 --> 22:16.754
And now that dream would never come true!

22:17.895 --> 22:19.435
I felt bad cleaning them up.

22:19.455 --> 22:22.597
I wanted you to help out too.

22:23.158 --> 22:23.658
Yeah, sure.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.981
You know, I just wanted to have warm noodles!

22:30.782 --> 22:35.524
But I'll be more careful with my coordination in the future, okay?

22:36.425 --> 22:37.666
Sorry, noodles!

22:37.886 --> 22:38.766
Sorry, Fuwawa.

22:39.046 --> 22:39.967
I ruined your dreams.

22:42.807 --> 22:43.487
BAU BAU!

22:43.608 --> 22:45.809
How's luck for noodles?

22:45.829 --> 22:47.870
We are fine noodles.

22:49.271 --> 22:49.451
No!

22:49.491 --> 22:51.433
No fire chicken noodles!

22:51.513 --> 22:52.713
It's cup noodles, no.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.615
Before we didn't have them.

23:04.650 --> 23:08.232
Unless there happens to be, like, a bowl-shaped gap in the floor.

23:08.252 --> 23:10.073
That would be a problem.

23:10.393 --> 23:11.594
That would be a problem.

23:11.914 --> 23:12.714
That's a problem.

23:12.734 --> 23:16.676
Why'd you eat it if you spilt it into a bowl-shaped hole in the floor?

23:16.696 --> 23:20.579
Yeah?

23:21.299 --> 23:24.241
You know what I'm thinking?

23:24.281 --> 23:25.862
Who else would use that hole in the floor?

23:25.922 --> 23:26.422
I can't.

23:26.462 --> 23:29.444
You know how much stuff would get in that hole in the floor?

23:30.936 --> 23:31.757
How much junk?

23:32.437 --> 23:34.258
A lot of fluff and fuzz, yeah.

23:35.939 --> 23:36.860
Extra toppings.

23:38.021 --> 23:39.542
BAU BAU!

23:39.562 --> 23:42.063
BAU BAU!

23:42.223 --> 23:44.705
Yeah, that was the dirtiest part of the floor.

23:45.105 --> 23:45.786
Right.

23:46.086 --> 23:48.868
Like seaweed.

23:48.948 --> 23:50.909
Oh, it's true, that would be good, you know.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.832
A lot of times the noodles have the seaweed, so extra seaweed, right?

23:56.667 --> 24:00.130
BAU BAU!

24:00.850 --> 24:02.611
Well, Moco-chan.

24:03.432 --> 24:08.295
The week just started, but I feel like it's already been a long week, hasn't it?

24:08.476 --> 24:09.316
Ruffians!

24:09.336 --> 24:11.398
Do you need something?

24:12.138 --> 24:13.759
I need a little push forwards.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.100
It's rough!

24:15.120 --> 24:17.142
BAU BAU!

24:17.722 --> 24:17.963
Well.

24:18.003 --> 24:18.923
Okay.

24:28.365 --> 24:29.245
Ruffians!

24:29.265 --> 24:32.746
Can you believe it?

24:33.766 --> 24:36.587
Somehow, it's already that time of week!

24:37.607 --> 24:38.747
How is it here already?

24:40.148 --> 24:42.328
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

24:42.668 --> 24:45.869
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

24:45.889 --> 24:47.309
Mococo!

24:47.329 --> 24:50.450
Ruffians!

24:51.770 --> 24:52.930
It's been a while, huh?

24:52.950 --> 24:55.451
Have you been good?

24:57.233 --> 24:59.674
Have you been making sure to take care of yourself?

25:02.936 --> 25:04.256
Maybe recently.

25:05.317 --> 25:05.517
No.

25:06.277 --> 25:08.098
You've been working a bit too hard.

25:08.118 --> 25:10.379
I know it's rough.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.801
You get wrapped up in things.

25:13.481 --> 25:14.421
You can't help it!

25:15.502 --> 25:20.644
But sometimes you have to remember to put yourself first before you can help others, okay?

25:21.525 --> 25:21.945
I know.

25:22.485 --> 25:23.306
Things have been rough.

25:24.526 --> 25:25.607
Sometimes I...

25:26.872 --> 25:30.073
You just feel like you spilled your noodles all over the floor.

25:30.733 --> 25:31.793
But don't worry!

25:32.454 --> 25:38.355
You can just clean it up, keep on going, but make sure you count, okay?

25:39.455 --> 25:40.276
You can do it!

25:40.896 --> 25:42.076
I know you can!

25:42.096 --> 25:49.418
Let's have a big battle scream together!

25:49.738 --> 25:50.178
Okay!

25:51.699 --> 25:51.859
Huh?

25:53.554 --> 25:58.638
3, 2, 1!

25:53.634 --> 25:58.638
You don't need to hear it, but... Ganbatte ne!

26:18.944 --> 26:19.084
BAU BAU!

26:19.584 --> 26:24.525
Wow, Moco-chan, that was quite the scream there.

26:24.565 --> 26:29.066
Together with the Ruffians.

26:29.086 --> 26:32.266
Just make sure to continue getting lots of rest, okay?

26:32.907 --> 26:35.807
I'll try.

26:35.827 --> 26:36.827
BAU BAU!

26:36.847 --> 26:39.628
Another amazing part of the day.

26:39.648 --> 26:42.368
I'm Doggie of the Day!

26:42.628 --> 26:44.188
Who's the Doggie of the Day today, Hamoco-chan?

26:44.208 --> 26:45.089
Doggie of the Day?

26:45.109 --> 26:46.169
Doggie of the Day?

26:46.889 --> 26:47.069
It's me!

26:48.740 --> 26:51.162
That's a beautiful voice!

26:51.262 --> 26:53.503
Look at all the colors!

26:53.923 --> 26:56.844
It's like a marble.

26:58.405 --> 27:03.728
You can kind of see inside Finn's nostrils there, right?

27:03.988 --> 27:05.569
Cute!

27:05.709 --> 27:08.310
It's cute when you can see inside the nostrils, right?

27:09.671 --> 27:11.272
Don't look inside our nostrils, Ruffians.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.137
It actually stands for fluffy and fuzzy.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.017
Fuzzy!

27:19.037 --> 27:22.120
As well for friend!

27:22.600 --> 27:23.121
Friend!

27:23.161 --> 27:26.163
Finn loves to cuddle and get head pats.

27:26.464 --> 27:28.606
And he just wants to be friends with everyone.

27:28.626 --> 27:30.367
The F stands for friend.

27:30.627 --> 27:31.988
Yeah, that's why.

27:32.008 --> 27:35.151
How does Finn BAU BAU, Moco-chan?

27:37.520 --> 27:39.581
I think it's like... BAU BAU!

27:39.882 --> 27:40.022
Oh?

27:40.682 --> 27:41.583
BAU BAU!

27:41.603 --> 27:41.643
Oh?

27:41.823 --> 27:43.544
BAU BAU!

27:43.904 --> 27:45.946
Oh, everything's kind of in bubble waters.

27:46.206 --> 27:50.709
So how do I shout see you?

27:51.169 --> 27:52.931
Do it again.

27:53.291 --> 27:54.111
BAU BAU!

27:54.151 --> 27:54.271
Yeah.

27:54.352 --> 27:57.173
BAU BAU!

27:57.334 --> 27:58.174
BAU BAU!

27:58.214 --> 27:59.215
BAU BAU!

27:59.415 --> 27:59.775
Fin!

28:00.356 --> 28:00.576
Fin!

28:01.510 --> 28:02.690
Beautiful.

28:02.950 --> 28:11.253
A beautiful, positive, and well-mannered boy that I think is the definition of man's best friend.

28:11.913 --> 28:18.295
You know, look at the cute little head tilt too.

28:18.735 --> 28:19.495
He loves you.

28:20.396 --> 28:22.816
BAU BAU!

28:23.397 --> 28:23.877
Right?

28:23.897 --> 28:27.558
Last year, how would an organized fan

28:30.673 --> 28:32.814
Right in between here, right Moco-chan?

28:33.195 --> 28:33.715
Right there.

28:36.577 --> 28:42.480
BAU BAU!

28:42.560 --> 28:43.600
Next, Ruffians!

28:43.640 --> 28:45.782
You've been keeping those paws moving, right?

28:46.022 --> 28:47.743
Very important to do.

28:47.763 --> 28:50.764
Let's check out where you've been going for walks.

28:51.885 --> 28:53.406
Today I went on a walk.

28:53.973 --> 28:56.115
De-den!

28:58.276 --> 29:00.238
Amazing!

29:00.498 --> 29:04.341
Look at all the fluffy cherry blossom trees there is!

29:04.361 --> 29:05.542
They're in full bloom.

29:05.622 --> 29:07.143
Are they still in full bloom?

29:07.163 --> 29:08.584
It's beautiful.

29:09.025 --> 29:09.265
Right?

29:09.305 --> 29:10.946
That's not fair.

29:11.166 --> 29:11.627
Why?

29:11.647 --> 29:13.008
Why is right?

29:13.148 --> 29:14.209
Right?

29:14.409 --> 29:15.810
So fluffy.

29:15.830 --> 29:19.232
I don't know if you want to walk and walk and walk.

29:19.332 --> 29:21.954
You just never return home, right?

29:22.115 --> 29:22.935
This is my new home.

29:22.955 --> 29:23.756
Right?

29:24.842 --> 29:25.764
This is my road.

29:27.146 --> 29:29.128
It really does look like an anime though.

29:29.409 --> 29:34.656
We hope that you're able to enjoy them lots before they all fell off the tree.

29:35.798 --> 29:38.061
Minecraft's real, right?

29:38.101 --> 29:39.763
Minecraft is real!

29:40.504 --> 29:42.525
I think this is more beautiful.

29:43.066 --> 29:45.187
BAU BAU!

29:45.628 --> 29:50.911
And next for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

29:51.291 --> 29:53.313
Hi FUWAMOCO!

29:53.333 --> 29:58.056
Do you have any comfort anime or manga you usually watch and read when you get sick?

29:58.597 --> 30:03.080
I usually read the same things every time I feel sick because they make me feel better.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.402
I'm glad you have things like that.

30:06.442 --> 30:10.505
We kind of have that, but it's not an anime.

30:10.525 --> 30:21.913
We kind of talked about this show a little bit around the time it debuted, but we really like a TV program that airs in Osaka called Tantei Night School.

30:25.615 --> 30:31.479
It's really funny and heartfelt, and it's a show that's been continuing since the 80s in Japan.

30:31.840 --> 30:35.963
And well, the viewers, they write in like scoops for the comedians.

30:36.423 --> 30:36.883
Cases.

30:37.184 --> 30:37.404
Cases?

30:37.664 --> 30:38.004
Yeah.

30:38.184 --> 30:42.087
Yeah, but the comedians, they're the detectives.

30:42.267 --> 30:44.289
And they have to crack the case.

30:44.489 --> 30:44.929
Yeah.

30:45.029 --> 30:46.070
Figure out the scoops.

30:46.110 --> 30:46.591
Yeah.

30:46.911 --> 30:47.251
Yeah.

30:47.291 --> 30:50.433
You know, sometimes it's things like, where does my dog go?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.677
Why are they so fat?

30:54.638 --> 30:58.380
You know, why does my egg explode when I put it in the microwave?

30:58.881 --> 31:01.602
I want to eat waffles with a manhole cover design.

31:02.023 --> 31:02.763
Please help me.

31:03.764 --> 31:04.524
Stuff like that.

31:04.885 --> 31:05.925
It's a bit chilly.

31:05.945 --> 31:15.491
It's just really so funny and cute and I feel like it shows so many of the things that we really love about Japan.

31:16.012 --> 31:18.353
It's all wrapped up in one show.

31:19.314 --> 31:21.015
So you know, we're really

31:21.619 --> 31:25.422
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

31:38.936 --> 31:39.837
I feel it!

31:40.057 --> 31:42.258
It's good when Nishida Kyokujo cries.

31:42.418 --> 31:42.958
Yeah!

31:43.018 --> 31:44.279
She's like, ahhh!

31:44.379 --> 31:45.980
And then I'm crying too.

31:46.180 --> 31:49.782
Yeah, the... the detectable?

31:50.002 --> 31:51.042
Yeah, the boss?

31:51.082 --> 31:51.643
Yeah.

31:51.703 --> 31:52.023
Yeah.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.545
Yeah.

31:55.585 --> 32:01.287
But I really hope that maybe one day they'll release- Oh my- Netflix or something!

32:01.307 --> 32:06.009
In English and then everyone can enjoy it, you know?

32:06.349 --> 32:08.230
It's such a good show, it's so good.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.811
It's a shame it hasn't been released in English yet.

32:12.119 --> 32:12.800
We're waiting.

32:13.901 --> 32:16.283
Waiting!

32:16.443 --> 32:18.685
BAU BAU!

32:19.125 --> 32:20.687
Thank you again, Ruffians!

32:20.707 --> 32:23.009
Thank you so much for your submissions.

32:23.289 --> 32:23.969
Ruffians!

32:24.490 --> 32:27.032
Have you ever wanted to be a FUWAMOCO Morning?

32:28.493 --> 32:30.655
If so, go to Twitter.

32:31.356 --> 32:32.597
Use that hashtag.

32:32.757 --> 32:36.080
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.062
Share your work with us.

32:38.442 --> 32:38.843
You know,

32:39.503 --> 32:40.825
Your Doggie of the Day.

32:41.185 --> 32:42.747
Maybe you have a question.

32:43.107 --> 32:44.428
Maybe you saw Pero.

32:44.448 --> 32:45.910
I thought maybe.

32:46.370 --> 32:49.353
You can be also have a good morning!

32:49.373 --> 32:49.994
Don't forget.

32:50.054 --> 32:50.515
Okay.

32:50.575 --> 32:51.195
Okay.

32:51.275 --> 32:53.237
BAU BAU!

32:53.798 --> 32:55.340
Well next we have

32:55.800 --> 32:57.881
An upcoming stream, right Moco-chan?

32:58.481 --> 33:00.141
I have an upcoming stream.

33:02.842 --> 33:05.103
I'm playing Touhou!

33:05.483 --> 33:08.824
Touhou Fujinoku Mountain of Fate.

33:09.124 --> 33:15.566
I know Moco-chan, you played it a bunch and then Marine-senpai coached you and you got much better.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.387
Here is the controller.

33:19.524 --> 33:20.164
I was there.

33:20.184 --> 33:21.566
I got to hear everything.

33:21.646 --> 33:22.707
I got to see everything.

33:22.847 --> 33:23.607
I learned a lot.

33:23.908 --> 33:28.191
So I wanna practice and hopefully the Marine-senchou-senpai will notice me.

33:28.592 --> 33:32.255
So I hope that you'll be there to help me too, Ruffians.

33:32.315 --> 33:34.957
And watch my first Touhou ever.

33:35.838 --> 33:38.761
BAU BAU!

33:38.841 --> 33:41.583
Next, we take a peek at our schedule.

33:42.664 --> 33:45.747
Well, it's a big weekend coming up for us.

33:46.207 --> 33:50.728
We have our super karaoke party in Taipei.

33:50.788 --> 33:57.270
So we're gonna do our best to hopefully make everyone BAU BAU more than they've ever BAU BAUed before.

33:57.350 --> 33:58.791
BAU BAU meeting!

33:59.691 --> 34:05.613
And then after that, I have my first solo rock n' roll party!

34:07.453 --> 34:10.394
I'm looking forward to it, but I'm really really really nervous.

34:10.875 --> 34:15.176
So I hope that you'll be there to cheer me on, my FUWAMOCO Ruffians!

34:16.196 --> 34:18.617
Are the Taipei things going to be streamed on 4Tune?

34:18.637 --> 34:20.217
I don't think so, no.

34:20.497 --> 34:27.838
They won't be, but... Maybe you have some Ruffian friends that are gonna be going that can let you know just how it was!

34:27.898 --> 34:30.439
Thank you, Ruffians!

34:31.239 --> 34:33.379
BAU BAU!

34:33.480 --> 34:36.080
Mocomoco might be vertical.

34:36.680 --> 34:40.301
I'm gonna try my best and sing vertical this time.

34:41.982 --> 34:42.963
Sing vertically!

34:43.223 --> 34:44.664
Hopefully not upside down!

34:44.684 --> 34:54.693
I guess I could always try singing horizontally, like lying down, but I don't know if the music will come out of me properly that way, so...

34:56.912 --> 34:58.433
BAU BAU!

34:58.633 --> 35:00.154
BAU BAU!

35:00.395 --> 35:01.676

35:20.830 --> 35:23.412
No more spilled noodles, right, Moco-chan?

35:24.052 --> 35:24.673
Hopefully.

35:25.613 --> 35:25.774
Better.

35:27.510 --> 35:27.971
Thank you.

35:27.991 --> 35:35.675
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!
