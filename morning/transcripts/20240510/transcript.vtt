00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.990
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.890
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.528
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.509
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.450
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.631
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.632
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.712 --> 00:05:32.812
BAU BAU!

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:39.258
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:40.239
Ruffians!

00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:44.983
It's episode 96 today!

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:48.967
BAU BAU.

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:58.001
It's not just episode 96, it's also the end of the week already!

00:05:58.082 --> 00:05:58.382
Weekend!

00:05:58.422 --> 00:06:00.464
BAU BAU!

00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:05.510
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:09.014
The 96th episode right before the weekend!

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:09.795
BAU BAU!

00:06:13.447 --> 00:06:14.768
I see some new Ruffians.

00:06:15.768 --> 00:06:16.549
Ruffians!

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:27.475
For those of you that are just joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:28.256
A.K.A.

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.256
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:32.958
And it's hosted by the Ruffians!

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.319
No.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.500
Shiori. No.

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:40.249
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:41.710
BAU BAU!

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.533
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:53.836
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:57.878
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:58.338 --> 00:07:00.779
BAU BAU!

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.621
This is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:07.016
BAU BAU!

00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:11.661
I wonder if we'll have any new new Ruffians on FUWAMOCO Morning 100.

00:07:11.782 --> 00:07:14.685
That would be nice.

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:16.927
Well, Moco-chan!

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:20.912
Let's start off today with another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:23.294
What do we have today?

00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.051
De-den!

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:35.755
Did you decide to organize some dogs yourself after my stream the other day?

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:43.640
Is this one of the dogs you unlocked?

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:49.885
Pero... Moco-chan, is this a Pero Sighting?

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:01.768
Wait, what's with the description of Jun?

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:05.450
Cute ball of love.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.671
Intelligent!

00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.072
Oh my son!

00:08:11.193 --> 00:08:13.794
No, this is Pero, you know?

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:18.056
I don't know.

00:08:18.836 --> 00:08:22.058
I don't think he's a good dog to organize Ruffians.

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:23.359
You know?

00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:27.584
Pero and a group of a bunch of dogs.

00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:30.585
I don't think he's gonna get along with them.

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:33.966
Especially not Garibaldi.

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:35.026
No.

00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:35.346
No.

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:37.846
Plus, Pero's round.

00:08:38.146 --> 00:08:39.166
Very round.

00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:41.087
I think you know it.

00:08:41.407 --> 00:08:48.148
If you try to organize him along with all those other dogs, they might start to go missing.

00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:53.649
But, I guess that's a way to clean and organize too.

00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:57.053
Get rid of the competition.

00:08:57.793 --> 00:08:58.433
BAU BAU.

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:04.555
Organizing dogs just got darker, Ruffians.

00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:06.776
BAU BAU.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:10.597
Well, I hope you had some fun.

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:12.658
Yeah?

00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:20.180
I would recommend though that you run an update on your game because I think something is... Something is broken!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.161
Yeah, this may be.

00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:25.189
BAU BAU!

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:25.509
BAU BAU!

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.032
It's really terrifying.

00:09:27.453 --> 00:09:28.134
Terrifying.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:28.896
Yeah.

00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:31.421
BAU BAU!

00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:31.902
BAU BAU!

00:09:31.922 --> 00:09:31.982
Wow!

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.464
Not terrifying!

00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:35.548
It's the exact opposite.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:35.749
Yes!

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:36.410
Exciting!

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.532
Exciting!

00:09:37.612 --> 00:09:38.454
Ruffians!

00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:40.979
Tomorrow!

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:41.600
Tomorrow!

00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.566
We're going to be performing live in Taipei!

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:45.427
BAU BAU!

00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.110
BAU BAU!

00:09:47.423 --> 00:10:01.192
We're going to be part of the hololive meet Super Karaoke Party together with some of our amazing senpai right there.

00:10:01.312 --> 00:10:04.234
We're going to be singing a bunch of songs.

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:08.056
Some J-pop maybe, some anime songs maybe.

00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:17.728
Before that, actually, we'll be meeting some very lucky Ruffians for the first time in two whole weeks!

00:10:19.383 --> 00:10:23.047
Where are we?

00:10:23.868 --> 00:10:26.830
We're super excited!

00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:30.574
But also really nervous.

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:35.459
But we're gonna sing our hearts out!

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:38.002
But, uh, Moco-chan.

00:10:38.242 --> 00:10:39.884
Ruffians, look at this!

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:43.300
De-den!

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.503
We've been on adjuncts going around Taipei!

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:54.387
You can hear us BAU BAUing from the streets of Abyss!

00:10:55.568 --> 00:10:57.269
That's so cool, right?

00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:57.890
Right!

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.832
I hope we haven't been too loud.

00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:04.534
Really disturbed some grandmas and grandpas.

00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:05.935
Yeah, but...

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:12.107
You know, it would be cute if they both BAU'd along with us, right?

00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:12.549
Right!

00:11:13.294 --> 00:11:14.735
Yeah, but Ruffians!

00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:19.478
That's absolutely what we need you to do at the concert, okay?

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.860
Yeah, we hope we can hear your voice lots and lots, okay?

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:25.882
And FUWAMOCO!

00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:32.966
We're going to do our best and hopefully the BAU BAU BYOU will get even stronger in Taipei!

00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:36.308
BAU BAU!

00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:37.449
Exciting!

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.871
Never BAU BAU too loud, no.

00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:43.852
BAU BAU lots okay!

00:11:43.872 --> 00:11:46.374
We'll be watching!

00:11:46.594 --> 00:11:47.494
Waiting!

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:48.875
Listening!

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:49.595
All this stuff!

00:11:50.336 --> 00:11:50.916
BAU BAU!

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:59.477
Well, there's been some other news with our whole Iain-senpai team.

00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:03.859
You might not have heard, Ruffians, but Calli-senpai!

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.004
Calli-senpai just recently went away for surgery.

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:14.066
But she was really worried about it.

00:12:14.206 --> 00:12:14.706
Understandably!

00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:17.974
It all went well.

00:12:17.994 --> 00:12:19.314
Yeah!

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.356
We were thinking about her lots and lots.

00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:25.559
I know, we were sure she was really stressed about it.

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:31.202
And she even said that on Twitter she was so worried that she couldn't sleep at all before.

00:12:31.242 --> 00:12:31.523
Yeah.

00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:34.164
You know, we've been lucky ourselves.

00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:36.346
We've never needed surgery before.

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:41.249
And hopefully it stays that way for us and all the Ruffians watching us today too!

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:41.849
Yeah!

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.030
It's scary.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:50.252
But, you know, we hope that she heals up super duper fast and that she has a quick recovery.

00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:50.492
Yeah!

00:12:50.532 --> 00:12:51.352
We know she will!

00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:52.193
Yeah!

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:58.935
And, well, we know it might be a little bit of a while before she's back, so eat her slice like normal.

00:12:59.035 --> 00:13:00.035
It makes sense.

00:13:00.055 --> 00:13:00.235
Yeah.

00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:03.098
You need to take a break in these times you know.

00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:08.885
We're sending you all our energy and fluffy and fuzzy vibes coming senpai!

00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:11.728
BAU BAU!

00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:15.252
Get better soon senpai!

00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.614
BAU BAU!

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:20.858
Yeah, those times you need to take a break.

00:13:20.978 --> 00:13:22.019
You better take a break.

00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:22.479
Yeah.

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:24.821
Yeah, or FUWAMOCO are gonna find you.

00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:26.222
She's doing well!

00:13:26.242 --> 00:13:27.303
She looks good!

00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:27.863
Right?

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:28.624
She looks good.

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:30.385
A beautiful photo.

00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:32.347
I wanna take a photo like that.

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:32.787
No!

00:13:32.807 --> 00:13:33.948
No, the thumbs up.

00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:35.069
Thumbs up photo?

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:36.430
The thumbs up photo.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.811
I don't have a thumbs up photo.

00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:40.164
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:40.284 --> 00:13:43.285
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:13:43.765 --> 00:13:44.065
BAU BAU!

00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:04.013
But that goal is reaching 1 million subscribers before our first anniversary!

00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:05.533
You know that, right?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.174
Right.

00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:06.834
Yeah!

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.895
We've been working hard to try to reach that goal!

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:11.916
Yeah.

00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:13.457
Yeah.

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:21.981
Well, you might have noticed, especially during Fufu Week, that there's been some vertical streams, and that's a part of it too.

00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:22.582
Yeah.

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:26.814
Right now, the official countdown.

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:31.757
We're 82 days away from our first year anniversary.

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:39.543
And right now, as you can see, Ruffians, we're at 831,000 Ruffians.

00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:42.125
That's crazy amount of Ruffians!

00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:43.105
Right!

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:44.926
Oh my gosh.

00:14:44.987 --> 00:14:48.149
But you know, some Ruffians, it's the math.

00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.382
You know, it is looking a little tricky.

00:14:52.462 --> 00:14:53.523
A little tricky.

00:14:53.703 --> 00:14:54.883
But we won't give up though!

00:14:55.043 --> 00:14:55.124
No!

00:14:55.204 --> 00:14:59.465
Yeah, we'll keep on working hard to meet the goal!

00:14:59.525 --> 00:14:59.806
Yes!

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:04.347
But the number one thing to remember is that it's not about the journey.

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:04.828
What?

00:15:04.848 --> 00:15:06.328
It's not about the goal!

00:15:06.628 --> 00:15:08.109
It's about the journey!

00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:08.929
Yes!

00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.332
It's still early morning.

00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:16.875
Don't open it!

00:15:16.955 --> 00:15:18.396
It's about to dirty!

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:26.788
We are not misunderstanding Ruffians!

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:27.529
We are!

00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:30.890
We can't have multiple- And so!

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.812
We're gonna continue to do our best no matter what!

00:15:34.992 --> 00:15:35.192
Yes!

00:15:35.312 --> 00:15:40.274
And you know, we're gonna continue to let everybody know that this is our big dream right now.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:40.714
Yeah.

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:46.356
Because you know, if you have something important that you want to achieve, you need to say it.

00:15:46.416 --> 00:15:46.697
Yeah.

00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:47.837
Be proud!

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:48.257
Yeah.

00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:51.458
Even if others say, you know, that's a silly dream.

00:15:51.478 --> 00:15:51.539
Hai.

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:52.319
Yeah.

00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:54.621
Nerissa, it's your dream.

00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:56.442
We're gonna do it!

00:15:56.462 --> 00:15:58.885
We're gonna reach this!

00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:00.947
The FUWAMOCO way!

00:16:02.904 --> 00:16:08.847
So hopefully, maybe Ruffians, we can give you a little bit of courage too to reach for your dreams!

00:16:08.907 --> 00:16:11.209
To put your dreams into work.

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:19.713
And maybe not being so scared of making yourself a little bit vulnerable if it means that you can accomplish something very important to you.

00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:21.995
If it matters to you, it's important.

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:26.436
Let's reach for our dreams together, okay?

00:16:26.696 --> 00:16:29.917
Please support us on our journey to one million, okay?

00:16:30.397 --> 00:16:33.258
BAU BAU!

00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:34.438
It's important.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:35.599
The journey.

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:38.200
The highway or the FUWAMOCO way.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.920
The journey, right!

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.520
Yeah.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.461
Your dream is to live peacefully.

00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:46.382
Then let's have a peaceful, happy life.

00:16:46.702 --> 00:16:47.802
BAU BAU!

00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:55.733
I said it'd be nice to be peaceful.

00:16:56.454 --> 00:16:58.215
But, Ruffians!

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.459
You noticed something, right?

00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:07.162
This week has been a bit different compared to last, right?

00:17:07.602 --> 00:17:07.982
Right!

00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:09.864
Yeah!

00:17:10.384 --> 00:17:11.425
It's been fluffy week!

00:17:12.325 --> 00:17:13.046
Fluffy week!

00:17:13.226 --> 00:17:13.807
My week!

00:17:14.207 --> 00:17:18.510
Because Moco-chan, well, you've been doing your best to rest up your barker, right?

00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:20.652
How's it been going, Moco-chan?

00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:23.912
I've been trying.

00:17:24.473 --> 00:17:25.995
I've been trying.

00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:26.897
What do you think?

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:29.601
The parker's owning a little bed of Ruffians.

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:35.739
I think so.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.220
Yeah.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.140
Trying.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.221
Wow.

00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:43.341
I'm really glad, Moco-chan.

00:17:43.481 --> 00:17:47.602
Just make sure you keep resting lots and lots, okay?

00:17:47.902 --> 00:17:50.003
I'm trying to rest but also be helpful.

00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:50.303
Yeah.

00:17:50.323 --> 00:17:52.844
Moco-chan, you're very helpful too.

00:17:53.204 --> 00:17:54.004
But, uh...

00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:58.429
Ruffians, there's one thing that I realized.

00:17:58.449 --> 00:18:00.211
Like, in particular!

00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:02.554
In particular.

00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:09.203
There's a lot of things, but I have a big issue without you here with me, Moco-chan.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:09.804
Really.

00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:12.428
Yeah, other than the obvious things like, uh...

00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:14.906
Now I have to play the game.

00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:16.147
What?

00:18:16.907 --> 00:18:20.130
I have to hold the controller, maybe sometimes- That's an issue!

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.212
It's a big controller.

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:23.973
My paws get tired.

00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:28.257
My paws are not big!

00:18:28.637 --> 00:18:33.741
Well, Ruffians, you know, Fuwawa, I'm not so good at left and right.

00:18:34.262 --> 00:18:34.562
Right?

00:18:36.163 --> 00:18:40.627
And then when it comes to clocks, sometimes that's a bit tricky too, right?

00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:53.717
And, well, apparently, if it's just me all on my own, I also have a really hard time keeping track of time.

00:18:53.778 --> 00:19:00.180
Somehow, I ended up playing Hitman for over 5 hours yesterday.

00:19:06.957 --> 00:19:08.979
You know I gotta be carried away, huh?

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.962
I was gonna tell Fuwawa.

00:19:11.262 --> 00:19:14.546
Remember, it's okay to play a bit longer today.

00:19:17.884 --> 00:19:19.905
I knew it was a good thing I didn't say that.

00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:20.645
Why?

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:22.606
You wouldn't play for 7 hours if I told you that.

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:23.887
I would have!

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:25.568
I would have!

00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:26.828
Water bottle.

00:19:26.848 --> 00:19:29.529
It's FUWAMOCO Morning, you're not the host today.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.090
Yes!

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.550
Hi.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.411
So yeah, I got a bit carried away.

00:19:33.431 --> 00:19:36.513
It was, you know, it was my first time playing Hitman.

00:19:36.933 --> 00:19:39.854
And there was just so much to explore and try out.

00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:43.296
So, I lost myself a little bit.

00:19:49.845 --> 00:19:50.746
It was fun.

00:19:51.307 --> 00:20:04.785
Yeah, I think the moment I was most proud of was when I threw my explosive ducky into the crowd with my target and somehow successfully got them without compromising myself!

00:20:05.346 --> 00:20:08.971
Moco-chan, come look at this!

00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:12.716
Yeah, that was pretty impressive, right, Moco-chan?

00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:14.232
Yeah.

00:20:14.612 --> 00:20:16.312
But it was amazing, right?

00:20:16.913 --> 00:20:17.413
Yeah.

00:20:17.973 --> 00:20:22.213
I really didn't think it would work, but it did.

00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:23.394
It did.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:24.894
Had to check it out.

00:20:24.934 --> 00:20:26.114
Okay, Ruffians?

00:20:26.294 --> 00:20:26.954
Hi!

00:20:26.974 --> 00:20:32.615
Yeah, you really never ever know what Agent 437's gonna be up to, huh?

00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:32.995
Hi.

00:20:34.536 --> 00:20:35.896
It was a lot of fun.

00:20:36.256 --> 00:20:39.516
Thank you, Ruffians, for the game suggestion too.

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.677
Hopefully one day we can play again together, Moco-chan.

00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:45.026
You think I'd be good at it?

00:20:45.206 --> 00:20:45.566
Agent 47.

00:20:46.027 --> 00:20:50.208
I don't know if I'd be good at it.

00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:52.648
BAU BAU!

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:55.469
BAU BAU!

00:20:55.509 --> 00:20:56.329
Not on the list.

00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:57.750
Not on the list anymore.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.270
Why?

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.850
Yeah.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.470
I'm here.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.451
Yeah.

00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:03.391
BAU BAU!

00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:04.591
Ruffians!

00:21:08.373 --> 00:21:09.775
You might have noticed.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.559
The other day while I was streaming.

00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:16.862
I came in with a concern.

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:19.785
You know.

00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:24.310
It's surprising.

00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:27.033
We are Ruffians.

00:21:29.617 --> 00:21:40.842
I was really scared, but you know, it's concerning when your little sister barges in, you know, when you're playing Touhou and focusing and just says, I made a mistake.

00:21:41.522 --> 00:21:42.083
Right?

00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:43.843
Yeah.

00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:55.669
Well, you know, what I was trying to do was heat up my leftover noodles that I couldn't eat earlier.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.501
You know, I know that you're supposed to pour hot water in them.

00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.182
That's how we make them normally.

00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:04.723
I read the instructions.

00:22:05.063 --> 00:22:07.644
Especially, you know, it's new.

00:22:07.664 --> 00:22:10.725
Instructions are important.

00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:15.947
What are you supposed to do if you don't finish them all?

00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:19.308
Anyways!

00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:21.008
I tried heating them up.

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:23.269
So I put them in for a minute.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.290
And then I walked away.

00:22:27.893 --> 00:22:29.534
That's where my mistake was, huh?

00:22:29.574 --> 00:22:29.734
Yeah.

00:22:29.754 --> 00:22:31.974
Huh.

00:22:33.295 --> 00:22:34.355
Yeah.

00:22:34.435 --> 00:22:35.596
I came back to the cup!

00:22:36.336 --> 00:22:39.257
And it looked like a big bubbly enemy from Hokuto no Ken!

00:22:40.277 --> 00:22:42.658
You're already dead.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:43.058
No!

00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:45.559
My noodles are already dead!

00:22:45.939 --> 00:22:47.879
The noodles were already dead!

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.321
It was really not good.

00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:52.361
Yeah.

00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:54.862
I wasn't expecting it at all!

00:22:55.322 --> 00:22:55.522
Yeah.

00:22:57.438 --> 00:23:00.600
Luckily though, it didn't explode everywhere or anything.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:01.941
I just left it there.

00:23:02.862 --> 00:23:03.443
Cooled down.

00:23:04.764 --> 00:23:05.764
And then I tossed it.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.046
Yeah, I didn't have to do anything.

00:23:08.667 --> 00:23:11.429
I felt bad about throwing it out.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.831
It's not good, Moco-chan.

00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:15.392
It was a mistake.

00:23:15.932 --> 00:23:20.135
But it's okay because you know, new foods are tricky, right?

00:23:20.676 --> 00:23:22.777
What are you supposed to do, Ruffians?

00:23:22.857 --> 00:23:23.098
Hi!

00:23:26.496 --> 00:23:28.017
Did you just eat them whole then?

00:23:28.037 --> 00:23:31.400
I guess that's your punishment for not eating them all right away.

00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:36.404
Yahoo.

00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:38.185
What if you don't have a bowl, hai?

00:23:38.285 --> 00:23:40.527
Put it in a bowl, that's the solution.

00:23:40.567 --> 00:23:43.509
What if you don't have a bowl still?

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:47.072
Hai!

00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:49.573
What if you only have two mugs?

00:23:50.094 --> 00:23:50.454
Hai!

00:23:50.474 --> 00:23:52.276
Put it in the mugs, Moco-chan!

00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:53.997
It's gonna be a big mug!

00:23:57.042 --> 00:23:57.942
BAU BAU!

00:23:57.982 --> 00:23:59.223
BAU BAU!

00:23:59.243 --> 00:24:00.803
BAU BAU!

00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:03.944
BAU BAU!

00:24:34.055 --> 00:24:37.616
But... There's been a misunderstanding.

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.238
Another misunderstanding.

00:24:42.158 --> 00:24:44.359
We've been doing good, you know?

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.881
This one, Ruffians!

00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:56.625
It's really embarrassing, so... I was just hoping, you know, that you'd forget about it!

00:24:57.285 --> 00:24:57.505
But...

00:25:00.407 --> 00:25:08.413
I keep on seeing very upset Ruffians on Twitter, so I thought I better address this.

00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:15.538
I better apologize for this.

00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:20.101
Finally, after a few weeks, Ruffians.

00:25:22.842 --> 00:25:28.766
You know, we had a special FUWAMOCO Morning together with Koyori-senpai, right?

00:25:30.638 --> 00:25:38.380
And, uh, she was talking about a yobai party and buying pajamas for us in the future.

00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:41.461
Just special for the party!

00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:51.724
And, uh, she said she was going to get sexy pajamas for me, for Fuwawa!

00:25:52.025 --> 00:25:56.466
And I got all flustered and she's... And I...

00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:01.541
I said, I'm not sexy, I'm Fuwawa!

00:26:02.261 --> 00:26:07.004
And, uh, it seems that that might have made some Ruffians very angry.

00:26:10.186 --> 00:26:15.869
But, uh, well, BAU BAU?

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.111
I'm just Fuwawa.

00:26:20.672 --> 00:26:21.052
I guess.

00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:26.916
If you think that's true, then, well,

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:37.673
It's rude of me to make statements like that, so... I'll try not to say things like that in the future, okay?

00:26:37.693 --> 00:26:41.035
I won't say things that'll make you upset, okay?

00:27:02.141 --> 00:27:02.741
BAU BAU!

00:27:04.143 --> 00:27:04.924
BAU BAU!

00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:08.949
BAU BAU!

00:27:11.252 --> 00:27:13.434
Well, let's forget about that!

00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:14.335
Right!

00:27:14.796 --> 00:27:18.440
And let's take a look at the cutest Doggie of the Day today, my Moco-chan!

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:18.841
Right!

00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:28.795
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:29.916
Sky!

00:27:30.257 --> 00:27:30.757
Sky!

00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:33.399
BAU BAU!

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.560
So cute!

00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:36.883
Look at the tongue!

00:27:37.043 --> 00:27:38.104
Beautiful color!

00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:41.467
I really want to touch the tongue.

00:27:41.947 --> 00:27:43.508
Don't touch the tongue though, no.

00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:44.670
But look, Sky!

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.012
Sky has the same fur color as us!

00:27:51.735 --> 00:27:52.956
Is that because of Sky?

00:27:52.996 --> 00:27:55.217
Did Sky make you sneeze, Moco-chan?

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.540
Well, Sky!

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.504
Sky's very curious and obedient, but a bit of a shy doggy too.

00:28:05.524 --> 00:28:06.224
Shy Sky.

00:28:06.485 --> 00:28:07.485
Yeah, Shy Sky.

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:09.687
She likes to explore new places!

00:28:10.107 --> 00:28:15.250
And, uh, when she does, sometimes she comes back scared because there's new people too.

00:28:16.732 --> 00:28:17.993
It's understandable.

00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:22.879
I was thinking, Sky and Moco-chan have quite a bit in common, huh?

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.361
How does Sky BAU BAU?

00:28:25.283 --> 00:28:26.845
I think it's... BAU BAU!

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:27.666
BAU BAU!

00:28:34.281 --> 00:28:36.021
BAU BAU!

00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:38.362
BAU BAU!

00:28:38.382 --> 00:28:40.522
I think it's accurate.

00:28:40.702 --> 00:28:41.502
I think so.

00:28:42.542 --> 00:28:42.863
Yeah.

00:28:43.103 --> 00:28:46.543
BAU BAU!

00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:54.465
Just like Moco-chan, Sky is doing their best to be brave and learn as much as they can about the world around them.

00:28:54.485 --> 00:28:56.025
Just like me!

00:28:56.065 --> 00:28:57.965
Yeah, just like you in particular.

00:28:57.985 --> 00:28:59.585
I feel like... Hmm.

00:29:08.638 --> 00:29:11.080
And Sky's doing their best too.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.342
Please make sure that you hold her paw as she gets stronger, okay?

00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.444
Especially around new people.

00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:20.385
New people's always a bit rough, right, Moco-chan?

00:29:21.466 --> 00:29:22.547
That's what the sniffle is for.

00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:26.378
BAU BAU!

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.161
And next!

00:29:30.362 --> 00:29:32.043
Today I went on a walk.

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:33.184
Ruffians!

00:29:33.384 --> 00:29:35.146
Making sure to stretch those paws right.

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:36.627
That's the point!

00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:38.569
Going out and seeing new things right.

00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:41.051
We have De-den!

00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:47.376
FUWAMOCO Abyssgard!

00:29:47.496 --> 00:29:48.777
Look at the colors!

00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:50.719
So beautiful.

00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:55.610
Wow, what an amazing way to start out your day!

00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:06.818
I hope you had a really great hike and that you got some good rest after it too.

00:30:06.958 --> 00:30:07.259
Nice!

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:08.720
Rest in peace, okay?

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.982
BAU BAU!

00:30:10.082 --> 00:30:11.564
BAU BAU!

00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:13.586
You eat so BAU-tiful.

00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:14.387
BAU-tiful.

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:14.608
Yeah.

00:30:14.728 --> 00:30:15.769
BAU BAU!

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.312
BAU BAU!

00:30:18.432 --> 00:30:20.074
I wanna go on a hike now too.

00:30:20.134 --> 00:30:21.236
That would be nice.

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:27.043
Oh, we also got another question.

00:30:27.804 --> 00:30:31.205
The Question of the Day today is... De-den!

00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:33.326
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

00:30:33.686 --> 00:30:37.247
I think it's pretty safe to say that you both love music.

00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:38.287
Just a bit, hoi.

00:30:39.568 --> 00:30:42.109
But what's your favorite setting to listen to?

00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:43.429
During walks?

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:45.070
While you do chores?

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:51.212
Or are you even sitting down in a big armchair doing nothing else like a true connoisseur?

00:30:53.322 --> 00:30:54.103
FUWAMOCO!

00:30:54.403 --> 00:30:56.205
We can't live without music.

00:30:56.645 --> 00:30:56.805
No.

00:30:57.266 --> 00:30:58.367
Music is us!

00:30:58.527 --> 00:30:58.647
Yeah.

00:30:58.807 --> 00:30:58.967
Right.

00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:02.771
You know, we love listening to music a lot.

00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:04.833
But, I think you know.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.341
The best answer is that we're always listening to music.

00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:10.541
The wonderful seven.

00:31:10.821 --> 00:31:12.042
You know, while we sleep.

00:31:12.582 --> 00:31:13.222
While we eat.

00:31:14.143 --> 00:31:16.323
We just always have it running.

00:31:16.343 --> 00:31:29.108
I feel like when we don't have it, when it's like off, suddenly the world's just like a little bit more... Yeah, it just, it brightens up our days so much.

00:31:29.328 --> 00:31:32.209
Yeah, lots of energy from good tunes, you know?

00:31:32.229 --> 00:31:34.510
So we hope, Ruffians, that

00:31:34.963 --> 00:31:40.490
Maybe our music will make you feel the same way one day in the future.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.153
But I don't know.

00:31:43.054 --> 00:31:45.838
When we're like, we sit down and listen to it.

00:31:45.898 --> 00:31:49.102
We don't just sit down and just do just that.

00:31:49.843 --> 00:31:50.704
Think about things.

00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:52.707
Does it count if you dance?

00:31:55.595 --> 00:32:00.357
Is that the same as sitting down in an armchair and doing nothing while listening to music?

00:32:00.457 --> 00:32:07.240
When we're doing our signatures on our postcards for you Ruffians, we're listening and singing to music too!

00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:09.982
The music never stops.

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:11.182
It doesn't stop!

00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:14.104
BAU BAU!

00:32:14.544 --> 00:32:20.306
While I've let the Ruffians sit in a big armchair like a true connoisseur and listen to our covers.

00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.167
Lifetime Showtime!

00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:26.470
Do it okay, Ruffians!

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.812
BAU BAU!

00:32:28.852 --> 00:32:32.975
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions this week.

00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:37.838
For your questions, your doggies, Pero Sightings even.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.120
And your logs too!

00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:43.382
As well as the FUWAMOCO's groups.

00:32:44.143 --> 00:32:49.927
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning's a very, very special show that we made together, Ruffians.

00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:54.023
Please continue to use the hashtag.

00:32:54.103 --> 00:32:57.786
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:59.868
BAU BAU!

00:33:00.088 --> 00:33:01.589
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.752
And next, we have some streams coming up.

00:33:04.772 --> 00:33:06.213
Moco-chan, what's the next stream?

00:33:06.233 --> 00:33:07.214
The next stream is...

00:33:07.914 --> 00:33:08.715
Day!

00:33:08.975 --> 00:33:17.044
Well, before this we're gonna be live in Taipei, so we're gonna do our best, but the singing doesn't stop because FUWAMOCO!

00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:21.569
I'm having my first solo rock n' rawr party!

00:33:21.589 --> 00:33:22.150
BAU BAU!

00:33:25.473 --> 00:33:26.435
I'm really nervous.

00:33:26.515 --> 00:33:28.238
I'm going to be all on my own.

00:33:28.398 --> 00:33:29.640
It'll be fine.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.522
You'll be good.

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:34.489
But I'm going to sing a bunch of my favorite songs.

00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:36.712
This time without Moco-chan.

00:33:36.812 --> 00:33:38.475
So maybe it'll be a little bit different.

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:40.009
I'll be different.

00:33:40.089 --> 00:33:42.130
I'm looking forward to singing with you more.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.291
That's you, Moco-chan.

00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.672
I want to!

00:33:44.712 --> 00:33:49.534
But this time, it's my solo Rock n' Rawr Party song.

00:33:49.914 --> 00:33:51.735
I hope you'll be there, okay?

00:33:52.295 --> 00:33:53.316
BAU BAU!

00:33:53.376 --> 00:33:54.977
BAU BAU!

00:33:55.297 --> 00:33:56.838
And today, Ruffians.

00:33:57.198 --> 00:34:00.759
For Ruffians who are joining us later during the archive.

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:01.740
Oh, a schedule.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.961
Oh, a schedule.

00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:03.501
I forgot.

00:34:04.081 --> 00:34:07.643
Because, well, after my Rock n' Rawr Party,

00:34:08.539 --> 00:34:10.700
FUWAMOCO we have a homework day!

00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:14.583
We're doing our best!

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:19.666
Ruffians, maybe you can catch up on some of the fluffy week that you might have missed.

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:22.928
And FUWAMOCO will catch up on some of the homework.

00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:25.590
That is always true.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.810
Yeah, we didn't miss.

00:34:28.912 --> 00:34:29.992
It just needs to get done.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:32.989
BAU BAU!

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:40.511
And for Ruffians joining us in the archive, here is your FUWAMOCO word for today!

00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:42.412
It's BAU BAU!

00:34:42.472 --> 00:34:44.152

It's a good co-word.

00:34:54.515 --> 00:34:59.996
