00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.340
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.334
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:08.354 --> 00:05:11.461
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:18.492
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:21.173
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:23.274
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:26.535
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:33.657
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:34.797
BAU BAU!

00:05:34.957 --> 00:05:39.099
Happy BAUWATIZE DAY!

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.899
BAU BAU!

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.247
Thank you so much for joining us today on Valentine's Day!

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:48.608
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.552
It's an extra special FUWAMOCO Morning today, ha?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:53.873
BAU BAU!

00:05:56.776 --> 00:06:08.820
Well, even though it's Valentine's Day and maybe it's a bit of a special day, there might be some Ruffians who decided to tune in for the first time!

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.961
So, let me explain.

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:17.583
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:19.063
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:21.224
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:22.284
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:30.168
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:36.590
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.492
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:42.313
BAU BAU!

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:46.814
Valentine's Day BAU BAU!

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:50.216
We have no jackets on because, you know,

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.517
It's a valentine's day.

00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:57.738
It's a bit of a special day.

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:01.399
You want to give chocolate to Pero?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.780
Why?

00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:11.342
Well, first, Ruffian's Pero's not here.

00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:15.083
So, you're gonna need to find him first.

00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:19.565
But... One Ruffian!

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:21.176
Did.

00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:21.256
Did.

00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:22.177
Did.

00:07:22.197 --> 00:07:23.778
Bought Pero.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:24.558
Let's take a look.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.560
Okay.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.801
De-den.

00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:32.343
You found Pero in your bed?

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:52.508
It looks like you even lit a fancy candle there.

00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:53.229
That's nice.

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:54.329
On your bedside?

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:54.930
That's nice.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.611
Just for you, maybe?

00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.653
Yeah.

00:08:02.013 --> 00:08:04.115
How did this happen?

00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:06.516
Did you close all your windows?

00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:09.978
You know, make sure the front door was locked.

00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:12.079
Was it that

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:18.881
It was because you made your bed, huh?

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:20.363
Ruffians!

00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:31.094
You might have not known, but Pero loves it when a bed is made nicely with fresh sheets.

00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:34.357
You know, that's probably what attracted him to it.

00:08:34.837 --> 00:08:35.358
Yeah.

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:41.360
Sorry, I don't think there's anything we can do to help you here.

00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:44.741
You'll have to sleep on the floor while he gets to bed, okay?

00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:47.562
That's the only solution.

00:08:47.662 --> 00:08:48.143
Okay.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.183
Don't ever make my bed, got it?

00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:59.046
Unfortunately, that's one way to avoid situations like this, but... BAU BAU!

00:09:03.128 --> 00:09:04.268
Complicated.

00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:07.029
BAU BAU!

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:07.809
Wow!

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:09.509
Ruffians!

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.930
As you might know, we had an amazing first collab with Chloe-senpai the other day!

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.571
And guess what!

00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:24.015
Not only just that, but we also released a cover song with her!

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:25.258
BAU BAU!

00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:29.629
Not here, but on her channel, we did BABYMETAL's "Gimme Chocolate!!"

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:30.892
Gimme Chocolate!!

00:09:30.932 --> 00:09:32.194
Did you listen, Ruffians?

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:36.435
You did?!

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:40.256
Well, Ruffians, maybe you haven't listened to it.

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:45.557
Maybe you listened to Advent's cover of Megitsune earlier, you know?

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:48.977
When we had our New Year outfits come out and everything.

00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:55.579
Well, if you like Megitsune, we really, really recommend that you go check out Gimme Choco, too!

00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:01.207
We look so cool and cute!

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.851
Cool and cute too!

00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:06.459
You know, maybe because FUWAMOCO...

00:10:07.642 --> 00:10:11.424
Wow, we dressed up a little bit like Chloe-senpai.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:16.567
We really, really love it.

00:10:16.627 --> 00:10:25.371
You know, before the cover video premiered, we also used some special magic to do a karaoke stream to get a tune.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.573
Did you like it, Ruffians?

00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:31.723
We had so much fun!

00:10:32.003 --> 00:10:39.065
You know, we sang a bunch of anime songs together like JoJo and Red Night Circulation.

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:43.006
And you know, it's archived on her channel too, so you get to go check it out now!

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.287
After FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:10:46.968 --> 00:10:48.489
You have fun!

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:55.738
Well, you know, we are just so thrilled to be able to be invited to sing together with Kawaii-senpai.

00:10:55.758 --> 00:10:59.583
And she was so sweet and nice to us too!

00:10:59.603 --> 00:11:02.587
We feel really really lucky, so...

00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:06.817
Thank you so much, Kure-senpai!

00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:08.679
BAU BAU!

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.744
Genesis of a Queen was nostalgic, right?

00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:13.064
Aishiteru!

00:11:13.124 --> 00:11:13.444
BAU BAU!

00:11:13.645 --> 00:11:15.987
Wow, Ruffians!

00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:25.751
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:46.027
It was a charity stream to raise money for cats protection in the UK.

00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:56.855
Her goal is 50,000 pounds, but together with the deadbeats, she blew that out of the water and we raised a total of 80,000 pounds all together!

00:11:57.916 --> 00:11:58.776
That's crazy!

00:11:59.256 --> 00:12:02.617
BAU BAU BAU!

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:08.859
Congratulations to Calli-senpai and everyone who supported the cause!

00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:12.240
And you know we had a bunch of fun together with Calli-senpai!

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.761
And looking at your cute pets, and Mario Party all together with Milky Queen!

00:12:19.702 --> 00:12:27.286
But I think, you know, more than anything, we're just really amazed by everyone's warm support.

00:12:28.027 --> 00:12:36.512
And Ruffians, we also want to say a big thank you to you for being there and for also donating too!

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:37.792
BAU BAU!

00:12:37.933 --> 00:12:38.713
Thank you!

00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:41.435
It made us very, very happy puppies.

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:41.955
BAU BAU!

00:12:47.706 --> 00:13:05.914
Wow, with today being Valentine's Day and everything, and you know recently there's been a lot of excitement about new hololive English words and events.

00:13:08.018 --> 00:13:15.783
So, you know, we share an update about the brand new hololive English Valentine's Mix!

00:13:15.803 --> 00:13:20.907
Because, well... We got some products for you!

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:22.648
Products for the Mococos!

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:29.673
Yeah, well... You know, Chishu, the Valentine's Mix includes a cute acrylic book charm.

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:31.134
You see right here?

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:32.495
Right here, you know.

00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:36.637
Also the embroidered towel with the hololive English...

00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:41.499
Also, it says MISS here, but if you get FUWAMOCO, it doesn't say MISS.

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.740
No, it doesn't say MISS.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.881
It says ADVENT on it.

00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:49.064
And you know, also the embroidery M1 badges too.

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:51.406
Yeah, just those ones.

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:52.687
They're pretty cute.

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:59.191
But if you purchase the set, you'll also get a handmade message card from us!

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.033
It's mine!

00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:03.675
You know the embroidery M1 badges?

00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:06.317
But, if you want a bit more valentine.

00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:29.931
Oh!

00:14:30.812 --> 00:14:32.113
Today is the day!

00:14:32.593 --> 00:14:33.794
Hi!

00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:34.815
You know it!

00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:40.180
Definitely wanna have a listen to our Valentine's Day voice pack!

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:40.880
Okay!

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.962
You already listened!

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.444
Thank you!

00:14:45.544 --> 00:14:48.346
If you haven't yet, today is the day, okay?

00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:50.128
It's the day to do so!

00:14:50.768 --> 00:14:51.449
It is!

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:54.251
Please get your paws on it if you haven't yet, okay?

00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:55.932
BAU BAU!

00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:00.075
Thank you so much, Ruffians.

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:01.496
Oh, you're gonna listen again?

00:15:01.516 --> 00:15:06.319
BAU BAU, thank you!

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.080
Ruffians!

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.842
It finally happened!

00:15:12.163 --> 00:15:13.304
Do you know?

00:15:14.344 --> 00:15:14.885
Do you know?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:23.923
Well, in about six months since we debuted, Moco-chan, you did it!

00:15:24.063 --> 00:15:24.523
I did it!

00:15:24.603 --> 00:15:29.685
I hit 200 sneezes together with you here!

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:30.705
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:15:30.725 --> 00:15:31.125
200, huh?

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:55.482
Moco-chan, actually, I searched it up, Ruffians, and this officially means that Moco-chan, you sneezed 200 times on stream within 197 days from debut.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:57.763
Wow.

00:15:58.063 --> 00:16:00.644
And that's on stream.

00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:02.945
I sneezed the most.

00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:07.263
That's something else.

00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:10.765
Are you okay, Moco-chan?

00:16:11.165 --> 00:16:11.506
Yes!

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:12.506
I think so!

00:16:23.674 --> 00:16:27.076
Well, congratulations, Moco-chan!

00:16:27.096 --> 00:16:27.536
Thank you!

00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:28.036
BAU BAU!

00:16:28.076 --> 00:16:29.817
Nothing to sneeze at, right?

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.618
What's a 500?

00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:40.122
Oh, well, Moco-chan, since you know this is a very special moment, can you make a speech for us?

00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:42.443
A speech?

00:16:42.843 --> 00:16:43.584
A speech!

00:16:44.084 --> 00:16:46.745
A sneeze.

00:16:47.305 --> 00:16:50.207
Do you wanna hear a sneeze speech?

00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:50.807
Yeah.

00:16:51.502 --> 00:16:52.122
Ruffians.

00:16:52.383 --> 00:16:55.645
To commemorate the 200 sneezes.

00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:57.706
Why?

00:16:58.546 --> 00:17:11.974
Well, I don't know, maybe it's a bit silly, but to me, I think that hitting 200 sneezes is, I don't know, it's a pretty big deal.

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:16.937
So, I'm happy.

00:17:16.957 --> 00:17:20.900
200 sneezes is a lot of sneezes, okay?

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:27.430
It's silly, but it means something to me.

00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:29.591
It means something.

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:34.414
Moco-chan, do you have any hopes and dreams for your sneezes in the future?

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:38.957
I think they're not gonna stop, so look forward to more, huh?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.701
That's all I can say, okay?

00:17:43.781 --> 00:17:45.182
You heard it, Mayans.

00:17:45.282 --> 00:17:48.143
Look forward to more sneezes.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:51.405
And in turn, more sneeches too.

00:17:51.725 --> 00:17:55.647
BAU BAU!

00:17:55.667 --> 00:18:00.529
The sneezes will just continue coming, huh?

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.609
Wow.

00:18:00.629 --> 00:18:03.030
That's good.

00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:08.493
Maybe for the Ruffians who are a bit scared of loud sudden sounds, sorry.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:12.926
Ruffians!

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:21.255
I'm sorry to say, but there's been another misunderstanding.

00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:27.241
And I'm pretty sure we did clear this one up already.

00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:30.144
You feel that way too, Moco-chan, right?

00:18:33.792 --> 00:18:34.772
It's chocolate.

00:18:35.393 --> 00:18:36.433
Chocolate.

00:18:36.773 --> 00:18:41.616
You know our newest song cover with Koe-senpai is Gimme Chocolate, right?

00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:46.298
And you know we've seen a lot of comments from Ruffians saying, No!

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.319
Don't give FUWAMOCO chocolate!

00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:49.379
They'll die!

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.220
Yeah.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.700
Ruffians.

00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.662
We talked about this, right?

00:18:57.723 --> 00:18:58.404
When are we?

00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:01.285
Ruffians.

00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:04.479
We're demon dogs!

00:19:04.939 --> 00:19:05.780
Demon dogs!

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.281
Demon dogs!

00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:09.862
You know, we're tough.

00:19:10.222 --> 00:19:11.583
We're rough.

00:19:12.363 --> 00:19:13.043
Chocolate.

00:19:13.964 --> 00:19:15.605
It won't hurt us.

00:19:15.965 --> 00:19:16.205
No.

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:18.366
Dogs, however!

00:19:19.127 --> 00:19:20.047
Regular dogs!

00:19:21.288 --> 00:19:22.048
Yeah.

00:19:22.288 --> 00:19:23.149
Not good.

00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:26.710
So don't give dogs chocolate.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.292
But you know, for us, FUWAMOCO,

00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:33.472
We just don't really like it, you know?

00:19:33.852 --> 00:19:35.816
It tastes bad to us, chocolate.

00:19:36.978 --> 00:19:38.822
But, we're Ruffians.

00:19:39.263 --> 00:19:41.888
You know, if it's made by someone we like...

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:48.841
We'll gladly accept it and we'll eat it and we'll like it.

00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:51.664
You know, just like Biboo's brownies?

00:19:51.704 --> 00:19:52.925
Yeah, yeah!

00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:53.526
You know.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.228
So don't worry.

00:19:55.648 --> 00:19:56.169
You know.

00:19:56.189 --> 00:19:58.271
FUWAMOCO!

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:00.954
We'll be okay even if we have some chocolate.

00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:02.195
Yeah, okay.

00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:04.077
But, to be honest,

00:20:04.918 --> 00:20:06.799
We much prefer pon-de-rings.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.502
But in case you couldn't tell, huh?

00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:14.423
Thanks for reminding us.

00:20:14.943 --> 00:20:16.604
You're welcome.

00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:18.564
We're deeming dogs, okay?

00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:21.726
Why did we say gimme chocolate?

00:20:21.746 --> 00:20:23.267
Don't worry.

00:20:23.407 --> 00:20:24.407
Don't have to worry.

00:20:24.427 --> 00:20:26.408
Don't need to be scared.

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:29.490
What about pon-de-rings with chocolate toppings?

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.490
Is not the best.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.410
Not preferred.

00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:34.172
Regular pon-de-ring.

00:20:34.312 --> 00:20:35.312
Thank you.

00:20:37.413 --> 00:20:39.314
Mixed messages, huh?

00:20:40.074 --> 00:20:40.295
No.

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:43.416
This is well explained, okay?

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:45.517
It just don't taste good.

00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:46.818
Understood?

00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:48.558
Understood!

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:49.939
BAU BAU.

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:51.360
BAU BAU!

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.101
Yeah.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.742
No more misunderstandings.

00:20:55.902 --> 00:20:57.542
Especially not on Valentine's Day.

00:20:57.562 --> 00:20:59.323
Not on Valentine's Day.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:20:59.803
Yeah.

00:21:00.684 --> 00:21:00.804
And...

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:02.497
Well, Ruffians.

00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:05.138
You haven't forgotten, right?

00:21:05.959 --> 00:21:07.540
Forgotten what, Moco-chan?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.241
Alice.

00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:12.643
It's Valentine's Day today!

00:21:13.683 --> 00:21:16.745
We said that like, not even 10 seconds ago, huh?

00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:17.205
But!

00:21:17.926 --> 00:21:20.307
You know it!

00:21:20.807 --> 00:21:24.149
We have something else special for you!

00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:25.090
Yeah!

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.251
You haven't forgotten, right?

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:28.272
Extra, extra special.

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:30.013
Right, right.

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:32.786
You didn't forget?

00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:34.209
You didn't forget mine?

00:21:35.391 --> 00:21:38.016
You forgot!

00:21:38.036 --> 00:21:41.863
I don't see it yet.

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.465
I don't see it either.

00:21:51.172 --> 00:21:54.693
Pup Talk!

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.233
Extra special!

00:21:56.613 --> 00:21:58.633
Oh no, Moco-chan!

00:21:58.873 --> 00:22:02.214
They forgot, so we just warned them.

00:22:04.775 --> 00:22:06.635
I still don't see any Ruffians!

00:22:07.015 --> 00:22:07.755
Ruffians!

00:22:07.815 --> 00:22:11.696
There was many opportunities to look at our schedule this week, you know!

00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:11.796
Many!

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:13.296
Many!

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:14.416
Unfortunately many!

00:22:14.436 --> 00:22:17.877
Because we touched it up there many, many times!

00:22:25.512 --> 00:22:25.852
Peter!

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:27.194
Peter!

00:22:27.574 --> 00:22:28.775
Thank you, Peter!

00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:30.377
The cover!

00:22:30.397 --> 00:22:32.839
A new cover song!

00:22:33.159 --> 00:22:33.940
Yes!

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:34.881
Yes!

00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:36.422
Did you not want it that hot?

00:22:36.462 --> 00:22:41.207
Ruffians, we prepared an extra special.

00:22:42.308 --> 00:22:43.989
It's not ready yet!

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.432
It's for Valentine's Day.

00:22:48.004 --> 00:22:52.085
You forgot it, just because it's not exactly on Valentine's Day.

00:22:52.105 --> 00:22:55.386
Valentine's Day is already very busy, okay?

00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:56.186
Yeah.

00:22:58.967 --> 00:22:59.267
Well.

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:03.188
Cover it tomorrow.

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:08.749
If we did it today, Ruffians, it'd just be too busy for Valentine's Day.

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.010
Right.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.550
Yeah.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:12.950
Yeah.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.251
I'm sorry you had a bajillion things for us.

00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:20.161
Ruffians.

00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:21.222
Hi.

00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:22.924
It's okay.

00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:24.646
Wow.

00:23:25.627 --> 00:23:31.973
I thought, you know, I knew a cover song's coming out and Moco-chan sent the Ruffians, I forgot.

00:23:32.293 --> 00:23:33.695
What is it coming out?

00:23:34.536 --> 00:23:37.259
Well, I'll be kind.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.262
And I'll remind you, but!

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:40.962
Yeah?

00:23:41.022 --> 00:23:43.024
You have to promise that you'll be there, okay?

00:23:43.064 --> 00:23:44.265
Because you forgot!

00:23:44.665 --> 00:23:45.426
Especially.

00:23:45.706 --> 00:23:46.106
Okay.

00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:46.487
Yeah.

00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:47.808
Yeah.

00:23:48.368 --> 00:23:52.111
It's premiering tomorrow at 6pm PT, okay?

00:23:52.171 --> 00:23:52.311
Yeah.

00:23:53.152 --> 00:23:54.834
It's for Valentine's Day.

00:23:54.854 --> 00:23:56.095
It's Valentine's Day.

00:23:56.115 --> 00:23:58.296
Even though it's a little present.

00:23:59.237 --> 00:23:59.758
Yeah.

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:04.882
But Ruffians, we did give you a hint, although I'm sure you've forgotten.

00:24:09.104 --> 00:24:14.626
Do you have any idea what the song might be based on the hint that you forgot?

00:24:14.646 --> 00:24:14.707
Huh?

00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:18.608
Huh?

00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:27.071
It's called Valentine's Dream.

00:24:29.612 --> 00:24:32.433
Now I'm starting to wonder, do we have it on our schedule?

00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:32.813
Yes!

00:24:34.174 --> 00:24:34.514
Yes!

00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:36.141
You wanna see?

00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:37.162
Do you wanna see?

00:24:38.483 --> 00:24:39.643
I will show the proof!

00:24:40.344 --> 00:24:40.904
Okay!

00:24:40.984 --> 00:24:41.144
There!

00:24:41.204 --> 00:24:42.005
Right there!

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:43.426
I see it!

00:24:43.486 --> 00:24:45.567
It says Thursday!

00:24:45.687 --> 00:24:47.128
It has not moved once!

00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:48.208
Thursday!

00:24:48.228 --> 00:24:49.349
Special text.

00:24:49.729 --> 00:24:51.070
Song cover release!

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.092
And look, the afterparty is there too!

00:24:56.113 --> 00:24:56.833
White Love.

00:24:57.233 --> 00:25:00.555
For some reason, I don't think we can release that.

00:25:00.855 --> 00:25:02.716
Because it's already released!

00:25:05.185 --> 00:25:06.105
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:25:06.445 --> 00:25:08.226
It's a present for the Ruffians.

00:25:08.286 --> 00:25:12.066
It's a special font so you pay attention to it more.

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:14.587
It's nice and cute and shiny.

00:25:16.847 --> 00:25:19.808
Cute and shiny is not what the Ruffians want, I guess.

00:25:20.648 --> 00:25:25.029
But I'm sure you'd like to know what song it is, right?

00:25:25.749 --> 00:25:27.509
Now that we teased you a lot.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.290
And made you say sorry lots and lots.

00:25:32.338 --> 00:25:34.359
Have you said it enough?

00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:46.842
Well, you know, because it is Valentine's Day, it's probably a little bit of a cute song, right?

00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:53.264
And, well, you know, FUWAMOCO, I kind of like anime.

00:25:53.724 --> 00:25:54.784
Just kind of.

00:25:55.044 --> 00:25:55.404
Right.

00:25:56.144 --> 00:26:01.206
So I'd say, you know, Ruffians, if you're a big anime fan like us,

00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:08.882
You'll definitely know this song.

00:26:09.482 --> 00:26:09.702
But!

00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:11.444
Maybe it's a bit older.

00:26:11.464 --> 00:26:16.989
Ninja school!

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:23.634
It's not Valentine's Day!

00:26:24.255 --> 00:26:27.638
Well, it's from an anime with...

00:26:31.963 --> 00:26:33.444
I think it's time for a drumroll.

00:26:33.464 --> 00:26:34.304
A drumroll?

00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:39.206
I was gonna give another hint, but I don't think there's a hint.

00:26:39.586 --> 00:26:49.430
I guess that's a lovely song, but a little bit of a different... A little bit of a different vibe.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.291
Drumroll time!

00:26:51.851 --> 00:26:53.952
Moco-chan, can you make it a special drumroll?

00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:56.378
Okay, Ruffians!

00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:57.959
All together!

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:11.791
We're gonna be releasing a cover of Let Me Be With You from the IMAX Holdings!

00:27:12.092 --> 00:27:12.792
BAU BAU BAU!

00:27:20.627 --> 00:27:31.281
We're so excited because this is a song that we've loved for many, many years!

00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:35.987
We really love the feeling of the song and you know that we are excited.

00:27:37.008 --> 00:27:39.090
We hope that you look forward to it!

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.333
I know, we think it turned out really nicely.

00:27:42.353 --> 00:27:51.361
So we hope you'll be there for the premiere on Thursday tomorrow at 6pm PT, okay?

00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:55.623
Don't forget again!

00:27:55.643 --> 00:27:55.723
Yeah.

00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:58.445
Okay, you forgot one.

00:27:58.485 --> 00:27:59.286
You're forgiven.

00:28:00.327 --> 00:28:02.068
Don't forget again.

00:28:02.428 --> 00:28:04.090
BAU BAU!

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.152
BAU BAU!

00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:08.193
Not today.

00:28:08.554 --> 00:28:09.154
Tomorrow.

00:28:09.234 --> 00:28:10.095
It's tomorrow.

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:12.177
But today we... There's other stuff here.

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.381
Well, Moco-chan.

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:19.604
It's okay, you know all the Ruffians were right.

00:28:19.984 --> 00:28:22.887
We did make it a bit of a busy Valentine's Day.

00:28:22.907 --> 00:28:23.908
Is that our fault?

00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:28.113
Well, I guess it makes sense if they have Valentine's brains.

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:29.874
Right?

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:30.475
Yeah.

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:31.416
Okay, next.

00:28:31.816 --> 00:28:33.178
Next Valentine's Day.

00:28:36.744 --> 00:28:39.846
No, Moco-chan.

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:42.128
No, couldn't do that.

00:28:42.268 --> 00:28:43.629
It'd be hard for FUWAMOCO.

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:48.894
But, huh, well, Ruffians.

00:28:49.915 --> 00:28:54.358
I know Valentine's Day might be a little bit rough.

00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:58.582
So, Moco-chan, maybe...

00:29:00.148 --> 00:29:05.092
Do you have something you could say that would make us feel a little bit fluffier?

00:29:05.232 --> 00:29:07.033
Maybe a little bit fuzzier?

00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:13.278
Do you wanna hear?

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:15.159
Okay, maybe.

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:16.120
Ruffians!

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.570
It's that day of the week!

00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:35.732
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:29:36.752 --> 00:29:41.533
And you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:49.415
Well... Happy Valentine's Day!

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.145
Yeah, in case you forgot, it's Valentine's Day!

00:29:57.585 --> 00:30:03.711
That means it's a day for happiness and love between all the important people in your life, okay?

00:30:04.712 --> 00:30:13.819
So, you might think it's all about receiving gifts or warm messages, but it's actually the opposite, okay?

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.362
It's about sending those messages, Ruffians, okay?

00:30:18.328 --> 00:30:24.094
So make sure today you let those that matter to you know that they matter.

00:30:25.595 --> 00:30:31.821
You know, and if you don't get any chocolates, oh well, they don't taste good anyways.

00:30:34.303 --> 00:30:40.409
So make sure you not only treasure those in your life that are close to you, but

00:30:41.497 --> 00:30:44.818
Also make sure to treasure yourself and tell yourself.

00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:47.098
You matter!

00:30:47.619 --> 00:30:48.019
Got it?

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:52.360
Let's all keep doing our best.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.220
Today too, okay?

00:30:56.061 --> 00:30:59.602
Have a happy Valentine's Day!

00:30:59.662 --> 00:31:00.842
Ganbatte de!

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.762
BAU BAU!

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.403
BAU BAU!

00:31:06.463 --> 00:31:07.444
Don't forget, okay?

00:31:07.504 --> 00:31:07.584
Yeah.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.001
BAU BAU!

00:31:12.622 --> 00:31:14.663
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:31:15.023 --> 00:31:16.284
Ruffians!

00:31:16.744 --> 00:31:24.368
We looked at a bunch of cute pets yesterday, but today is special Valentine's FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:31:24.989 --> 00:31:26.710
Who's our Doggie of the Day today?

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.651
Our Doggie of the Day is De-den!

00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:29.211
Cute!

00:31:35.998 --> 00:31:37.199
You see Kida!

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.503
Kida's all dressed up here!

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:45.770
Looking so cute!

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.976
Maybe she's going to revive us if we eat too many sweets today!

00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:58.707
Apparently Kira's number one way of healing is through boobs.

00:31:59.448 --> 00:32:00.829
That makes sense!

00:32:01.489 --> 00:32:03.250
Boobs please!

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.831
Boobs!

00:32:03.931 --> 00:32:04.912
Boobs!

00:32:05.092 --> 00:32:07.193
BAU BAU!

00:32:07.453 --> 00:32:09.555
Well, how does Kira BAU BAU?

00:32:12.028 --> 00:32:17.079
Oh, like a... "I need a potion" kind of BAU BAU!

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.322
Aw, Ultraman... No, that's Kida!

00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:31.924
That's how Kida BAU BAUs!

00:32:32.264 --> 00:32:34.486
Not how Ultraman BAU BAUs!

00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:38.089
No, it's not the same, okay?

00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:43.694
Well, you know, Kida... Kida is super fluffy!

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:45.216
Just like me!

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.037
Or just like a cloud!

00:32:47.638 --> 00:32:52.683
Yeah, which is good because, you know, I'm sure she'll pull you back down to Earth

00:32:53.283 --> 00:32:59.530
If you're feeling like you had too much chocolate on Valentine's Day... I have something I wanted to say!

00:32:59.550 --> 00:32:59.611
Huh?

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:05.057
Whatever, Mococo.

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:09.562
I think Kida is also like Mococo!

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:12.593
Fuzzy.

00:33:12.854 --> 00:33:15.055
Thank you for always being there for your Ruffians, Hina!

00:33:15.095 --> 00:33:15.596
BAU BAU!

00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:20.120
And for the day I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

00:33:35.732 --> 00:33:36.933
Fashionable!

00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:38.754
It's a little scary.

00:34:04.426 --> 00:34:05.426
Ima omoitsuita.

00:34:08.207 --> 00:34:09.008
It's pretty cute.

00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:10.808
I think it's cute.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:18.331
Thank you for sharing this very cute, a little scary Valentine's Day sighting with us.

00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:20.672
We're glad it brightened up your walk a bit.

00:34:20.752 --> 00:34:22.153
It didn't scare you, okay?

00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:25.596
Ruffians, it's kind of spooky.

00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:26.156
Demonic.

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:26.957
Hey!

00:34:27.117 --> 00:34:28.279
Hey!

00:34:28.319 --> 00:34:29.520
Be nice, okay?

00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:34.825
It's Valentine's Day, okay?

00:34:34.845 --> 00:34:37.448
BAU BAU!

00:34:37.468 --> 00:34:41.692
I hope you have a very nice Valentine's Day walk today, Ruffians.

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:44.035
A nice day for a walk.

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:45.837
BAU BAU!

00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:52.866
And next, for our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:34:53.827 --> 00:34:56.249
Valentine's is all about love, right?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.572
Lots of stuff, lots of stuff.

00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:04.135
So, what are the qualities and traits that you want out of someone you love?

00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:10.400
What are the things that you want to see in an ideal romantic partner?

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.342
Oh, uh...

00:35:13.965 --> 00:35:20.552
Well, we haven't really thought seriously about something like this.

00:35:20.572 --> 00:35:29.982
Ruffians, what are you making that face for?

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:36.000
Maybe, maybe not.

00:35:36.421 --> 00:35:37.242
FUWAMOCO!

00:35:38.463 --> 00:35:39.244
Kinda silly.

00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:40.586
Kinda silly, huh?

00:35:40.946 --> 00:35:42.548
Maybe not.

00:35:43.169 --> 00:35:47.394
Someone that will appreciate our silliness because we're really silly!

00:35:47.414 --> 00:35:48.736
Yeah, I guess.

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:55.676
Someone that's ready to be dragged on adventures even when they don't want to be.

00:35:55.716 --> 00:35:57.076
Like, I'm on a pondering now!

00:35:57.376 --> 00:35:59.617
We're gonna find a pon-de-ring!

00:36:00.437 --> 00:36:00.937
Right.

00:36:01.657 --> 00:36:05.058
Someone that enjoys the silly things that we like to.

00:36:05.078 --> 00:36:12.079
Yeah, and I guess someone who will understand even if we're a little bit selfish at times too.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:12.820
Right!

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:13.480
No!

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:16.060
I don't know.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.786
I feel like some people may think it's a silly answer, but I don't know.

00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:23.289
Personally, I think it's everything.

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:25.192
It's everything to us.

00:36:25.652 --> 00:36:29.918
And Ruffians, you remember we can smell if you're a good or bad person, right?

00:36:30.198 --> 00:36:30.378
Yeah.

00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:31.601
Got it.

00:36:32.522 --> 00:36:37.606
You know, I think that someone that respects you is very, very important.

00:36:37.766 --> 00:36:40.668
And you know, and loves all the little quirks you have.

00:36:40.688 --> 00:36:45.452
You know, someone that you can enjoy spending time with always.

00:36:45.472 --> 00:36:56.160
You know, that's the type of person that I hope Raiden, and Rose, and Toei, and Yaily, they all find too hot.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.202
Yeah, I don't know if they...

00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:05.660
I don't think it's working, huh?

00:37:05.941 --> 00:37:06.663
But I hope so too!

00:37:06.703 --> 00:37:06.964
You know?

00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:08.713
Yeah.

00:37:09.053 --> 00:37:09.374
Yeah.

00:37:09.734 --> 00:37:10.434
Yeah, huh.

00:37:11.055 --> 00:37:11.295
Yeah.

00:37:11.815 --> 00:37:14.917
BAU BAU!

00:37:16.178 --> 00:37:21.101
Thank you so much for all your submissions and for Valentine's submissions!

00:37:21.341 --> 00:37:23.902
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:37:23.922 --> 00:37:30.266
Well, I'm sure we're gonna have an amazing start to our day today on Valentine's!

00:37:31.467 --> 00:37:33.268
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:37:33.288 --> 00:37:33.828
BAU BAU!

00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:35.109
Well, but...

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.812
I hope you remember this next stuff, huh?

00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:41.593
Ruffians remember this one.

00:37:41.653 --> 00:37:42.734
Yeah, that's okay.

00:37:42.814 --> 00:37:43.755
It's been busy.

00:37:43.775 --> 00:37:45.196
I'm happy about that.

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:48.258
Because it's definitely on our mind!

00:37:48.278 --> 00:37:56.244
Our next theme is... Our Valentine's Day theme.

00:37:57.685 --> 00:37:59.847
It's tonight, Ruffians!

00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:02.048
We're really nervous.

00:38:02.709 --> 00:38:03.029
Yeah.

00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:05.231
Our first Valentine's Day.

00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:10.735
We've prepared a lot though, so we really hope you'll be there.

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.997
What if some Ruffians don't know what this is, huh?

00:38:13.637 --> 00:38:19.102
Well, it's important you're there because you make the choices.

00:38:21.064 --> 00:38:25.128
So if you're not there, well... We don't know how it might go.

00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:26.208
No.

00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:29.551
So, we hope you'll be there!

00:38:29.852 --> 00:38:31.373
And afterwards...

00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:38.158
We have a continuation together with the Doggy Pack!

00:38:38.598 --> 00:38:48.664
Doggy Pack, we hope that you'll join us for the continuation afterwards after our Valentine's Day together with you!

00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:50.506
BAU BAU!

00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:55.869
And if we take another look at our schedule, Ruffians, you can see!

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:01.413
On Thursday the 15th, we have a song cover release!

00:39:01.613 --> 00:39:02.054
Yes!

00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:02.654
Yes!

00:39:03.535 --> 00:39:05.996
Let me be with you from 2 bits!

00:39:06.517 --> 00:39:09.779
Please don't forget again!

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.881
Please don't forget!

00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:16.644
We're really excited for it!

00:39:16.704 --> 00:39:19.726
We put a lot of love into it!

00:39:21.247 --> 00:39:32.938
Because, well, us, the Ruffians, you know how much music is really important to us, and how much we love singing, so we really hope that you'll be there for the premiere, that you'll listen to it lots, okay?

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:33.859
Yeah.

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:36.601
Which is a song that's important to us.

00:39:37.903 --> 00:39:42.748
So maybe you might not know it, but you'll be happy if you listen to it.

00:39:43.129 --> 00:39:44.831
I'm sorry, okay?

00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:45.511
Okay.

00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:50.257
As long as you're there.

00:39:50.377 --> 00:39:53.320
Well, that's the end of our Valentine's Day plan.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.763
It kind of goes on to two days, huh, Moco-chan?

00:39:55.863 --> 00:39:56.684
Or three days?

00:39:58.846 --> 00:39:59.847
It's Valentine's week?

00:39:59.907 --> 00:40:01.208
It's Valentine's!

00:40:01.708 --> 00:40:10.773
