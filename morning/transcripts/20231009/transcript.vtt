05:10.185 --> 05:14.649
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:14.849 --> 05:19.073
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:19.133 --> 05:22.095
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.135 --> 05:24.037
BAU BAU!

05:24.797 --> 05:27.280
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:27.360 --> 05:29.702
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:32.140 --> 05:34.741
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:34.781 --> 05:36.402
BAU BAU!

05:36.822 --> 05:40.303
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:40.884 --> 05:42.464
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:42.944 --> 05:44.065
What did you just say?

05:44.185 --> 05:44.665
Thank you.

05:45.605 --> 05:46.326
No, after that.

05:46.626 --> 05:47.306
Ruffians.

05:48.526 --> 05:51.908
Okay, I heard Ruffians.

05:52.148 --> 05:52.668
No!

05:52.848 --> 05:53.728
Ruffians!

05:54.329 --> 05:59.150
It's FUWAMOCO Morning's 30th episode!

05:59.230 --> 06:00.351
Yeah!

06:03.011 --> 06:08.137
Thank you for starting your day, your week, off with us again today.

06:08.157 --> 06:10.439
I guess it's not the month, but not the month.

06:10.499 --> 06:11.881
BAU BAU!

06:11.921 --> 06:13.643
Thank you!

06:13.683 --> 06:20.591
For Ruffians joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held

06:20.811 --> 06:23.972
Every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:24.112 --> 06:24.892
FUWAMOCO.

06:24.972 --> 06:25.412
Yeah.

06:25.732 --> 06:28.853
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:29.473 --> 06:34.854
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:35.094 --> 06:42.036
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:42.136 --> 06:42.856
Yeah!

06:43.276 --> 06:47.237
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:47.637 --> 06:49.578
BAU BAU!

06:50.678 --> 06:51.460
Wow!

06:51.760 --> 06:54.685
Start off our morning with doing howls!

06:55.085 --> 07:00.774
We have a Ruffian spot peril.

07:00.794 --> 07:03.118
A peril sighting?

07:04.264 --> 07:04.684
Huh?

07:05.144 --> 07:05.685
De-den!

07:06.905 --> 07:07.105
Oh!

07:08.286 --> 07:09.346
Went to the arcade?

07:09.426 --> 07:12.288
Oh, a Ruffian went to the arcade with them!

07:12.628 --> 07:13.348
Interesting!

07:13.468 --> 07:16.730
Pero was sculpted onto... Ruffians!

07:17.190 --> 07:20.431
Wait, what kind of shady arcade did you end up going to, huh?

07:20.611 --> 07:24.533
Uh, yeah... Kinda sounds a bit suspicious to me, too...

07:26.914 --> 07:28.616
It's a good thing you went with friends.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.537
You saved their numbers, right?

07:30.557 --> 07:34.740
We hope you had a good time and nothing weird happened.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.780
Nothing weird, right?

07:35.860 --> 07:40.604
You just had a good time, beat up your friends a bit.

07:40.724 --> 07:42.405
In video games, right?

07:42.445 --> 07:43.346
Actually...

07:47.128 --> 08:00.144
Ruffians, have you ever accidentally come across a cool looking arcade randomly before and went in to kind of see, check it out, you know, what kind of forgotten items they might have?

08:00.464 --> 08:05.090
Sometimes, you know, there's some really cool retro games, maybe a lot of, I don't know.

08:05.470 --> 08:05.690
Right!

08:29.053 --> 08:29.713
You know what?

08:30.814 --> 08:31.854
I like those arcades.

08:31.894 --> 08:34.315
They're really mysterious.

08:35.355 --> 08:37.796
So mysterious it's a bit scary.

08:37.836 --> 08:39.037
You like the scary ones?

08:39.417 --> 08:39.997
I don't know.

08:40.037 --> 08:42.298
You never know what's gonna happen.

08:42.498 --> 08:48.440
Even if they're smoky and dark and sometimes there's hidden hallways that lead to back rooms with more games.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.502
Wow, Ruffians.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.123
Please be cautious, okay?

08:53.143 --> 08:54.304
Yeah, yeah, okay.

08:54.364 --> 08:57.266
Especially if they have funny tokens of peril on them.

08:57.606 --> 08:57.946
Uh-uh.

08:58.066 --> 08:58.447
Yeah.

08:58.587 --> 08:59.647
That seems dangerous.

08:59.948 --> 09:00.628
Yeah.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.090
BAU BAU!

09:03.150 --> 09:03.610
BAU BAU!

09:04.350 --> 09:05.651
Thank you.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.534
Wow, there's been some pretty exciting news recently.

09:09.734 --> 09:10.534
Did you catch it?

09:10.895 --> 09:11.735
Ruffians.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.618
Ruffians, I'm not saying Ruffians.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.196
Importantly.

09:17.216 --> 09:27.242
Yesterday, I was doing Council vs 3D showcase and something very exciting was announced!

09:27.722 --> 09:33.405
Council and IRyS-senpai are now officially a new group together!

09:34.105 --> 09:35.166
He's so right!

09:35.426 --> 09:40.649
All five of them are now named hololive English -Promise-!

09:40.669 --> 09:42.290
Were you surprised, Ruffians?

09:43.234 --> 09:44.835
We're really happy for them.

09:45.075 --> 09:47.136
And it's so cute!

09:47.177 --> 09:49.778
We wish them all the best with their new beginnings, right?

09:49.798 --> 09:54.301
They should be filled with many, many new adventures.

09:54.661 --> 09:59.985
If you weren't able to check out the special 3D collab, we highly recommend it.

10:00.025 --> 10:09.931
The games are really fun, but we're really surprised that Kronii-senpai, Fauna-senpai, Mumei-senpai started saying Doki Doki Morning together.

10:10.511 --> 10:14.513
What a great start to a new chapter!

10:14.593 --> 10:22.818
Welcome, hololive promise!

10:22.958 --> 10:24.819
Very special day.

10:25.799 --> 10:26.980
Wow, Ruffians.

10:27.921 --> 10:31.082
There's something we'd also like to share.

10:31.142 --> 10:33.964
Something we'd like to take you about.

10:39.570 --> 10:46.215
FUWAMOCO has an original introduction song, right?

10:46.796 --> 10:48.657
Right!

10:49.418 --> 10:52.260
Lifetime Showtime!

10:52.720 --> 10:57.484
Ruffians, thank you so much for 200,000 views!

10:57.564 --> 10:59.545
Since yesterday we hit 200,000!

11:01.527 --> 11:06.050
Thank you so much for listening to it and loving it lots and lots and lots.

11:06.070 --> 11:07.191
We're so thankful.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.974
It really does mean a lot to us.

11:10.214 --> 11:15.979
It's our first little original song, so it's really special.

11:16.639 --> 11:21.222
We didn't think it'd reach 200,000 views so fast, ever.

11:21.422 --> 11:22.143
Maybe.

11:22.483 --> 11:25.545
Maybe Ruffians are just very passionate.

11:25.565 --> 11:36.753
You know, back when we said that we'd like it to reach 300,000 views one day, we were thinking, like, maybe one or two years from now, you know?

11:36.773 --> 11:38.534
But we're very, very happy.

11:40.055 --> 11:42.756
If you want, we can reach that sooner.

11:43.177 --> 11:45.378
Alright, I guess.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.799
It doesn't have to be in two years from now.

11:47.859 --> 11:48.379
Yeah.

11:48.759 --> 11:57.283
But, you know, we want a lot of Ruffians, hololive fans, and maybe, like, complete VTuber newbies to be able to listen to it.

11:57.303 --> 12:01.685
And then maybe we can get a better idea as to who we are.

12:01.865 --> 12:04.786
So it makes us really happy, you know?

12:06.741 --> 12:10.265
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

12:11.006 --> 12:14.791
It makes us really excited for our next original too, right?

12:15.412 --> 12:17.094
BAU BAU!

12:17.154 --> 12:18.015
Thank you!

12:18.095 --> 12:21.439
Please continue to enjoy listening to it, okay?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.641
The show can't stop!

12:27.107 --> 12:30.950
Thank you Mumei!

12:30.970 --> 12:33.492
Wow, back to some more exciting things.

12:33.572 --> 12:34.813
More music news!

12:34.873 --> 12:36.854
More music news, I guess that's true.

12:37.475 --> 12:42.999
Mumei-senpai has some pretty exciting things going on today.

12:43.479 --> 12:51.385
First of all, at 8pm PT, Mumei-senpai will be continuing on with Part 2 of the Birthday Karaoke.

12:51.625 --> 12:52.325
And guess what?

12:54.386 --> 12:57.188
Ruffians.

12:57.269 --> 13:08.298
Not only the guests, but shortly after at 9.30pm PT, she'll be premiering her new original song!

13:08.338 --> 13:10.960
It's so cool.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.361
Right?

13:12.461 --> 13:17.885
We were already really excited for it when we heard that Mamei-senpai would be having a new song come out.

13:18.206 --> 13:21.909
But after seeing the thumbnail here, we really can't wait.

13:23.817 --> 13:25.878
What do you think it'll be like, Ruffians?

13:26.558 --> 13:29.620
I'm really... I feel... I feel I don't know.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.763
It could be like an emotional song about Mumei-senpai's journey.

13:35.903 --> 13:39.265
But... I feel like... Deathcore?

13:39.805 --> 13:40.185
Why?

13:41.046 --> 13:43.987
I feel like it might be a bit spooky too.

13:44.428 --> 13:45.248
It could be either.

13:45.268 --> 13:45.648
An aria!

13:45.668 --> 13:46.068
Emotional.

13:46.108 --> 13:47.509
Emotional and spooky.

13:53.649 --> 13:54.850
Deathcore.

13:55.010 --> 13:57.331
There's a lot of deathcore there, Moco-chan.

13:59.132 --> 13:59.812
I'm excited.

13:59.892 --> 14:01.393
No matter what, I'm excited.

14:01.613 --> 14:02.713
Right, right.

14:03.534 --> 14:06.755
Let's look forward to tonight at 9.30pm.

14:06.795 --> 14:10.777
That's like only 12 hours plus a little bit.

14:11.657 --> 14:12.958
12 hours plus a little bit.

14:13.338 --> 14:14.259
Very close.

14:14.459 --> 14:15.579
Very, very close.

14:15.679 --> 14:16.019
Okay.

14:18.679 --> 14:19.539
I'm excited.

14:19.599 --> 14:20.440
I'm excited.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.581
BAU BAU!

14:27.523 --> 14:36.346
I don't want to think too much about this next part because Ruffians, I was starting to gain a little confidence that maybe FUWAMOCO that we've grown.

14:36.746 --> 14:45.670
You know that there wasn't really any misunderstandings being created anymore, but again,

14:47.250 --> 14:49.774
There's something that we need to clear up with you.

14:50.094 --> 14:51.296
It's very important.

14:52.177 --> 14:52.537
Yeah.

14:53.462 --> 14:56.323
Doing our Rock n' Rawr Party the other day, you know?

14:56.723 --> 15:00.885
I was talking about how we had lots of copies of this one CD, right?

15:01.466 --> 15:02.786
Right?

15:02.846 --> 15:09.369
We didn't really know the reason, but because of that, you know, we could just... We could give the Ruffians a copy or two!

15:09.889 --> 15:14.331
But, Moco-chan... Somehow, you misheard this.

15:14.992 --> 15:17.273
I think it was completely justified, okay?

15:17.973 --> 15:18.953
Right, Ruffians?

15:19.734 --> 15:21.614
If you listen back to it, you can...

15:23.055 --> 15:23.695
Understand.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.337
It all makes sense that I misheard what I did, okay?

15:29.598 --> 15:30.319
I don't think so.

15:30.699 --> 15:31.199
I don't think so.

15:31.239 --> 15:31.980
I'm innocent.

15:32.140 --> 15:32.380
No.

15:33.080 --> 15:33.320
No.

15:37.102 --> 15:37.922
Ruffians.

15:38.843 --> 15:40.384
You know what Moco-chan heard?

15:41.684 --> 15:43.905
She heard puppies, not copies.

15:46.547 --> 15:48.588
Different copies of the CD.

15:51.179 --> 16:00.245
You know, and considering the next song coming up, I was just a bit concerned that things were getting a bit sillier than I expected.

16:00.265 --> 16:02.926
But I was wrong.

16:04.247 --> 16:05.148
I just misheard.

16:06.588 --> 16:09.229
No, puppies are for sharing.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.690
Puppies are for keeping.

16:12.850 --> 16:14.050
Keeping, yeah.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.871
Nothing, nothing seems at all.

16:17.152 --> 16:17.332
No.

16:18.252 --> 16:19.492
Copies, not puppies.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.033
Yeah, right?

16:21.593 --> 16:23.574
I can have a lot of CD copies.

16:24.234 --> 16:24.394
No.

16:25.774 --> 16:27.055
Puppies are for keeping.

16:28.115 --> 16:30.496
Not sharing with the Ruffians.

16:33.061 --> 16:40.026
I have a feeling that the Ruffians have not understood the misunderstanding yet.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.380
Puppies.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.621
Sounds like copies.

16:45.701 --> 16:46.181
Say it.

16:47.141 --> 16:47.581
Puppies.

16:48.361 --> 16:48.821
Copies.

16:49.482 --> 16:50.902
It sounds very similar.

16:50.962 --> 16:51.842
I don't think so.

16:52.622 --> 16:54.143
You're only hearing puppies.

16:54.263 --> 16:54.963
Copies.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.443
Copies.

16:56.723 --> 16:58.123
Copies of a CD.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.104
Not puppies of a CD.

17:00.564 --> 17:01.084
Different.

17:01.184 --> 17:01.624
So.

17:02.544 --> 17:03.965
I'm good now, Ruffians?

17:04.225 --> 17:08.246
You can't copy a puppy.

17:08.306 --> 17:08.906
You can't.

17:08.926 --> 17:09.286
Uh-uh.

17:11.309 --> 17:12.530
Not coffee!

17:12.550 --> 17:17.213
Puppies and poppies and not coffee.

17:17.854 --> 17:21.436
You understand now, right?

17:21.476 --> 17:24.458
We have to make sure you understand.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.419
Say it.

17:26.499 --> 17:28.020
Coffee, no, no.

17:28.421 --> 17:29.942
Okay, Moco-chan, let's just move on.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.383
Say it, Ruffians!

17:31.543 --> 17:33.004
You understand now!

17:34.660 --> 17:37.782
These Ruffians are a bit more cooperative, huh?

17:38.222 --> 17:39.223
Right!

17:39.443 --> 17:42.244
Are you going through a rebellious phase, huh?

17:44.266 --> 17:45.226
You understand.

17:45.706 --> 17:46.707
I've made it clear.

17:47.707 --> 17:49.048
Puppy coffee.

17:49.889 --> 17:51.470
Puppies and coffee.

17:53.731 --> 17:56.332
The Ruffians are too silly and rebellious.

18:00.232 --> 18:00.612
Next!

18:00.832 --> 18:01.332
BAU BAU.

18:01.552 --> 18:02.533
They understand now.

18:02.573 --> 18:03.393
They understand.

18:03.473 --> 18:03.813
Yeah.

18:03.893 --> 18:04.893
Yeah, yeah.

18:06.733 --> 18:14.615
Well... Actually, we also... We have an apology to make.

18:14.955 --> 18:16.195
But not to the Ruffians!

18:16.635 --> 18:16.835
No!

18:17.456 --> 18:17.736
Right?

18:18.536 --> 18:20.336
No, they're going through a rebellious phase.

18:20.376 --> 18:22.937
We don't need to... They need to apologize to us.

18:22.957 --> 18:24.017
Yeah, right.

18:24.657 --> 18:27.558
Well... This apology is actually for... Senpai.

18:30.987 --> 18:40.838
You know, I was looking through my notepad and I noticed something weird.

18:54.773 --> 19:01.715
You know, I noticed that I scribbled down Respond to Ali-senpai's DM a while ago.

19:02.095 --> 19:03.515
And I was really confused.

19:04.216 --> 19:09.577
Because it turns out I read it while I was half asleep and then I didn't respond.

19:10.017 --> 19:14.018
And then half asleep I wrote the task down and then I totally forgot.

19:14.178 --> 19:14.578
Why?

19:15.218 --> 19:15.839
How could I?

19:17.259 --> 19:18.439
I didn't know about it.

19:18.479 --> 19:20.840
Moco-chan never said anything to me.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.620
I was really confused.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.001
I was like, what DM?

19:26.015 --> 19:27.656
Pretty awful, Moco-chan.

19:28.496 --> 19:29.377
More awful.

19:30.057 --> 19:32.738
You know, though, I apologize a lot.

19:32.798 --> 19:34.819
I apologize profusely, okay?

19:34.879 --> 19:36.200
But... Oe-senpai!

19:37.600 --> 19:42.102
Oe-senpai, I apologize profusely now, okay?

19:42.162 --> 19:42.943
You get it, right?

19:42.983 --> 19:43.383
Right?

19:43.423 --> 19:43.623
Right!

19:48.806 --> 19:50.847
But you know, Ruffians.

19:51.207 --> 19:53.468
You know.

19:53.689 --> 19:56.330
It wasn't even a couple days that I didn't respond.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.012
Do you know how long it was until I noticed?

20:04.114 --> 20:05.815
Oh, in case you want to see, here's proof.

20:05.855 --> 20:09.617
You know how many days I didn't respond to it for?

20:19.926 --> 20:21.027
It was bad Ruffian.

20:21.047 --> 20:21.787
Moco-chan see it.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.628
It was over a week.

20:36.428 --> 20:38.410
We're weak Ruffians.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.230
A whole week.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.092
A whole week.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.473
That's awful.

20:43.994 --> 20:47.296
No, I was just really confused when I saw my notes, okay?

20:47.737 --> 20:48.377
I panicked.

20:49.698 --> 20:50.759
Yeah.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.061
We're sorry.

20:53.661 --> 20:54.642
Senpai.

20:54.682 --> 20:56.563
Did you just say we're sorry?

20:57.504 --> 20:59.385
Oh, senpai.

21:01.907 --> 21:02.608
We're sorry.

21:06.509 --> 21:07.570
It won't happen again.

21:08.950 --> 21:10.571
Right here.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.632
BAU BAU!

21:13.732 --> 21:16.413
How do I make you up for it?

21:16.673 --> 21:18.554
I'm very, very sorry, Aoi-senpai!

21:18.714 --> 21:27.278
Moco-chan, are you gonna show Aoi-senpai how amazing you are at Apex?

21:27.638 --> 21:29.719
Are you gonna sacrifice me?

21:29.739 --> 21:31.179
Show your big sister off!

21:33.663 --> 21:34.023
Yeah.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.925
Yeah, right?

21:37.645 --> 21:39.146
Apex is her love language?

21:39.526 --> 21:40.527
I've heard that.

21:40.987 --> 21:41.847
I've heard that.

21:42.347 --> 21:45.129
What are you doing with the love language?

21:46.149 --> 21:47.590
Apex.

21:48.210 --> 21:53.333
We're sorry.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.254
We're sorry.

21:55.894 --> 21:56.795
Mata!

21:57.775 --> 21:59.376
BAU BAU!

22:04.171 --> 22:06.432
Apology accepted.

22:06.753 --> 22:09.834
You can't say that yourself, Moco-chan.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.995
I'm speaking for all of you, FUWAMOCO.

22:13.015 --> 22:16.557
Apology accepted.

22:18.257 --> 22:19.418
And that's it!

22:19.458 --> 22:21.099
Doggie of the Day!

22:22.519 --> 22:25.661
No, no, no, no, Moco-chan.

22:26.421 --> 22:28.442
It's the beginning of the week, you know.

22:29.574 --> 22:29.994
Right.

22:30.755 --> 22:38.661
And that means that Moco-chan is going to show how strong of a demon dog she is, right?

22:39.501 --> 22:44.845
You're gonna challenge something that you've been challenging for a little while now.

22:49.949 --> 22:50.529
You know.

22:50.549 --> 22:50.609
BAU!

22:54.557 --> 22:57.239
I feel like this is something Moco-chan, you can overcome.

22:57.259 --> 22:59.861
It's something I want to do.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.542
It's something you want to do.

23:01.562 --> 23:05.144
The Ruffians need to know I'm just an assistant here.

23:05.204 --> 23:07.766
Moco-chan wants to do this on her own, right?

23:07.786 --> 23:12.189
It's something difficult and Moco-chan's going to overcome it.

23:15.231 --> 23:17.213
I'm sure the Ruffians understand though.

23:18.086 --> 23:22.668
There's things that you want to do, and want to get done, and get better at.

23:23.048 --> 23:28.710
But then, when it comes to the day to do it, you can do it another day.

23:30.071 --> 23:30.471
No!

23:30.611 --> 23:35.473
Today's the day because Moco-chan's going to be eating natto!

23:35.793 --> 23:36.213
Once more.

23:37.034 --> 23:38.114
She hasn't eaten it really yet.

23:38.908 --> 23:43.550
This is Moco-chan's first time trying to eat it on FUWAMOCO Morning.

23:43.651 --> 23:45.271
I do want to eat it!

23:45.351 --> 23:48.133
It's just, right now is maybe not the best time.

23:48.173 --> 23:49.514
Maybe tomorrow is better.

23:49.654 --> 23:51.475
Today is the day, Moco-chan.

23:52.135 --> 23:55.717
Maybe for some Ruffians, artichoke natto is natto.

23:56.117 --> 23:58.018
It's a common breakfast food in Japan.

23:58.058 --> 23:59.919
It's made of fermented soybeans.

24:00.800 --> 24:04.041
It can be rather slimy and sticky and smelly.

24:05.482 --> 24:08.744
But it's really, really, really, really, really healthy for you.

24:09.125 --> 24:09.825
SSS.

24:10.446 --> 24:11.586
Not Shiny Smiley.

24:12.147 --> 24:12.767
Story.

24:13.508 --> 24:14.889
Sticky, slimy, smelly.

24:15.209 --> 24:15.849
Natto.

24:15.929 --> 24:19.852
It's really healthy for you!

24:19.872 --> 24:21.093
I didn't know!

24:21.733 --> 24:22.573
Moco-chan.

24:22.793 --> 24:25.974
If you conquer your dislike, you'll be able to... Ah, your dislike of natto.

24:26.014 --> 24:28.314
You'll be able to protect the Ruffians for a long time.

24:28.334 --> 24:28.814
I'll be stronger.

24:28.894 --> 24:30.875
I do... I do wanna eat it.

24:30.895 --> 24:35.915
It's just... I have to get used to it, but I would like to not get used to it today.

24:35.935 --> 24:36.696
Nope.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.396
Today's the day.

24:37.456 --> 24:37.556
Oh!

24:37.816 --> 24:38.756
Moco-chan!

24:39.536 --> 24:41.216
It's like... Are you feeling confident?

24:42.157 --> 24:42.757
Not at all.

24:42.897 --> 24:43.477
Not at all?

24:43.497 --> 24:45.897
Like... Compared to before, what would you say?

24:45.917 --> 24:47.737
Ten percent.

24:48.198 --> 24:48.938
Ten percent?

24:49.978 --> 24:50.598
I feel like...

24:53.261 --> 24:57.403
My taste buds are not gonna accept it.

24:57.423 --> 25:03.327
10% is 10% and today, Moco-chan, you're finally going to eat natto properly.

25:03.347 --> 25:04.908
You're gonna eat it.

25:05.269 --> 25:07.010
Not just put it in your mouth, okay?

25:07.830 --> 25:08.131
Yeah.

25:08.831 --> 25:09.031
Yeah.

25:09.672 --> 25:10.752
Moco-chan, listen, listen.

25:11.213 --> 25:16.977
If you start having doubts, think of how Poruru-oneechan would be so proud of you, right?

25:18.258 --> 25:18.538
Right?

25:20.859 --> 25:21.499
She will be.

25:22.080 --> 25:22.480
She will be.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.120
Can you not stir it up though, please?

25:24.160 --> 25:25.401
No, no, I need to do this.

25:25.461 --> 25:27.402
You will at least have my chopsticks.

25:27.862 --> 25:28.182
I do.

25:28.462 --> 25:30.543
I got your- I don't want to stir it up!

25:30.623 --> 25:33.004
Okay, but you promised tea today.

25:34.165 --> 25:34.245
Ah.

25:34.265 --> 25:36.446
You have to properly eat it, okay.

25:37.886 --> 25:39.727
Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir.

25:40.467 --> 25:41.088
Okay.

25:42.968 --> 25:43.809
I always have this issue.

25:43.829 --> 25:45.870
Can you please clean off the chopsticks?

25:45.930 --> 25:46.010
No.

25:47.759 --> 25:48.319
They're clean.

25:48.799 --> 25:50.400
No, but... Here, here, here, here.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.820
You stirred it up and now it's not good.

25:53.981 --> 25:54.581
It's all good now.

25:54.741 --> 25:55.161
No, it's not.

25:55.181 --> 25:55.881
It's all good now.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.522
Can I have tea to start, please?

25:57.542 --> 26:02.443
And I have tissues!

26:03.803 --> 26:04.064
Okay.

26:05.204 --> 26:05.424
Okay.

26:05.644 --> 26:05.984
Tea.

26:06.164 --> 26:06.764
Okay.

26:07.504 --> 26:08.285
Quickly!

26:08.345 --> 26:08.685
Quickly!

26:09.085 --> 26:10.165
Quickly, Moco-chan!

26:10.185 --> 26:10.265
Time!

26:10.365 --> 26:10.705
Time!

26:10.725 --> 26:14.806
What are you doing?

26:15.027 --> 26:16.367
I'm going to shake it around my mouth.

26:19.307 --> 26:20.488
Okay, Moco-chan.

26:20.508 --> 26:23.390
First, it's important to do this.

26:23.430 --> 26:26.052
Let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi.

26:26.092 --> 26:26.672
Thank you!

26:26.692 --> 26:29.454
I'll do my best, but I'm sorry if I can't.

26:31.816 --> 26:32.776
Okay, Moco-chan.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.198
Itadakimasu.

26:36.359 --> 26:38.760
Why is it... You gotta eat it this time.

26:39.241 --> 26:41.022
It has to reach your tummy, okay?

26:42.363 --> 26:43.464
That's one bean.

26:44.504 --> 26:46.186
I am doing one bean, okay?

26:47.293 --> 26:49.414
I haven't been able to do two or three.

26:49.434 --> 26:51.956
I do the tummy, okay?

26:52.216 --> 26:53.617
Ruffians, is one enough?

26:54.298 --> 26:55.638
One is enough for today, right?

26:55.658 --> 26:56.019
One is nothing.

26:56.039 --> 26:57.700
That's like eating a piece of salt.

26:58.280 --> 26:58.540
What?

26:58.560 --> 26:59.121
No, it's not.

26:59.141 --> 27:00.221
It's nothing.

27:00.541 --> 27:01.382
This is a bean.

27:01.562 --> 27:04.064
Think of it as like a... I don't know.

27:04.464 --> 27:05.144
What do you mean, no?

27:05.164 --> 27:06.065
A raspberry.

27:06.785 --> 27:08.326
What do you mean, no?

27:08.446 --> 27:09.387
Chuu, right?

27:09.487 --> 27:10.067
Chuu.

27:10.708 --> 27:11.168
Chuu.

27:11.188 --> 27:12.109
Okay.

27:13.493 --> 27:14.473
What are you doing with that thing?

27:14.573 --> 27:16.474
I'm placing it on the corner, okay?

27:18.235 --> 27:18.855
Moco-chan.

27:18.875 --> 27:19.375
It's better.

27:19.395 --> 27:20.736
It's better?

27:20.976 --> 27:21.956
It's better this way!

27:22.557 --> 27:24.658
Don't question, just accept, okay?

27:28.999 --> 27:30.100
I don't know what she's doing.

27:31.281 --> 27:33.663
I'm putting knives in the beans, okay?

27:33.683 --> 27:36.024
I don't think I can do two!

27:36.104 --> 27:38.506
I don't think I can do two!

27:39.326 --> 27:42.288
Don't sneeze while I'm attempting my challenge, okay?

27:45.690 --> 27:48.092
Okay Moco-chan, you ready?

27:50.734 --> 27:53.836
They look... Don't they look so yummy?

27:53.856 --> 27:55.237
They look very sticky today.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.419
It's not as smelly as last time though.

28:01.032 --> 28:04.813
Ruffians, I know we talked about it earlier, but...

28:26.774 --> 28:28.236
She's gonna try to get out of this.

28:28.516 --> 28:32.699
If I... If I... If I eat a bean, can I go to sleep?

28:32.759 --> 28:32.979
What?

28:33.640 --> 28:37.923
Can I go to sleep if I eat a bean?

28:39.824 --> 28:40.685
What?

28:41.886 --> 28:42.306
No!

28:42.326 --> 28:43.507
No way!

28:43.647 --> 28:45.028
Ruffians say no!

28:45.048 --> 28:46.790
Can I?

28:47.550 --> 28:47.950
Sure.

28:48.051 --> 28:52.474
Two beans in the sleep... I get to sleep after one bean, okay?

28:52.934 --> 28:54.195
Two beans, Moco-chan.

28:54.215 --> 28:54.776
Just one.

28:56.317 --> 28:56.817
Chuu.

28:56.897 --> 28:57.958
The Ruffians say yes.

28:58.198 --> 28:58.998
Chuu in the tummy.

28:59.159 --> 29:00.159
Chuu's a good number.

29:00.619 --> 29:01.320
Into the tummy.

29:01.340 --> 29:01.520
Yes.

29:01.540 --> 29:05.062
Starts with a T. Tummy starts with T. Right.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.122
No, no Chuu.

29:06.302 --> 29:06.742
No Chuu.

29:06.802 --> 29:08.463
I've seen too many Chuu's!

29:08.643 --> 29:09.524
It's Chuu today.

29:09.544 --> 29:14.607
Chuu is the number today, Moco-chan.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.187
Okay, she has Chuu!

29:17.228 --> 29:19.789
I'm gonna put it in my mouth and then I can go to sleep.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.391
No, you have to eat it, Moco-chan.

29:22.471 --> 29:22.911
Okay.

29:29.938 --> 29:32.758
What is that?

29:34.759 --> 29:36.219
Unhappy door opens.

29:36.799 --> 29:43.320
Don't just look at it.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.300
I'm staring it down.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.141
It looks very slimy.

29:46.521 --> 29:47.801
It's not.

29:48.401 --> 29:49.761
It's not.

29:50.681 --> 29:51.101
It's healthy.

29:51.121 --> 29:54.242
Okay, last time the problem was I left it in my mouth for too long.

29:55.583 --> 30:02.027
Moco-chan, we're running out of time!

30:02.147 --> 30:03.168
I know, it wafted.

30:03.288 --> 30:05.629
It wafted and my tummy's not ready for it.

30:05.669 --> 30:08.131
I'm putting this down.

30:09.133 --> 30:12.496
She has two beans still.

30:12.556 --> 30:14.957
Eat it quickly, would you like that?

30:15.218 --> 30:15.878
Go ahead, eat it quickly.

30:16.418 --> 30:18.480
Make sure you enjoy the flavor though, okay?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.922
Thank you, Tochigi Farmers.

30:21.102 --> 30:22.563
Okay, here we go!

30:23.344 --> 30:23.684
Five!

30:24.124 --> 30:24.584
Four!

30:24.605 --> 30:26.086
No, no, no, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

30:27.006 --> 30:27.327
Ten!

30:27.467 --> 30:27.707
Nine!

30:27.847 --> 30:27.987
Eight!

30:28.027 --> 30:29.568
No, no, no, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

30:30.329 --> 30:30.789
Ten!

30:31.650 --> 30:32.170
Nine!

30:33.271 --> 30:33.531
Eight!

30:34.412 --> 30:34.892
Seven!

30:35.633 --> 30:35.973
Six!

30:36.793 --> 30:37.114
Five!

30:38.177 --> 30:38.697
Four.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.178
Three.

30:41.099 --> 30:41.859
Two.

30:42.719 --> 30:42.900
One!

30:44.861 --> 30:45.201
Moco-chan.

30:45.781 --> 30:46.161
It's one.

30:46.481 --> 30:46.962
It's zero.

30:47.002 --> 30:47.982
You're out of time!

30:48.182 --> 30:48.402
Okay.

30:48.603 --> 30:48.823
Okay.

30:49.083 --> 30:49.343
Okay.

30:49.503 --> 30:49.823
Okay.

30:50.203 --> 30:51.924
Okay.

30:51.964 --> 30:52.665
Willpower!

30:52.745 --> 30:53.485
Willpower!

30:53.525 --> 30:54.326
Willpower!

30:54.366 --> 30:54.986
Willpower!

30:55.006 --> 30:55.606
To the tummy!

30:55.666 --> 30:56.447
To the tummy!

30:56.507 --> 30:57.327
Willpower!

30:57.487 --> 30:57.987
Okay.

30:58.348 --> 30:59.208
Willpower!

30:59.288 --> 30:59.768
Yeah!

31:01.029 --> 31:01.889
Natto!

31:04.602 --> 31:06.263
Moco-chan, go for it, go for it!

31:07.083 --> 31:07.763
You can do it!

31:07.863 --> 31:08.703
You can do it!

31:09.264 --> 31:10.044
Don't cry!

31:11.584 --> 31:13.825
Moco-chan's making a face like a normal.

31:16.406 --> 31:16.886
What?

31:18.247 --> 31:20.127
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

31:20.747 --> 31:22.508
That didn't work.

31:22.568 --> 31:25.849
It's just that, Moco-chan.

31:25.869 --> 31:27.030
Moco-chan.

31:36.141 --> 31:37.502
Moco-chan, here's the tea.

31:37.542 --> 31:40.784
Why are you passing me a natto?

31:40.824 --> 31:41.665
You didn't eat it.

31:41.745 --> 31:42.665
It's been in your mouth.

31:42.685 --> 31:44.266
Eat it from the napkin.

31:44.506 --> 31:47.228
I'm not gonna eat the natto.

31:47.548 --> 31:49.049
It touched my tongue.

31:49.149 --> 31:51.811
It's supposed to touch your tummy.

31:51.831 --> 31:56.754
You touched the main part of my tongue with all the taste buds.

31:57.715 --> 32:00.316
Natto's supposed to touch the tummy.

32:02.133 --> 32:15.802
Well, Ruffians, I guess that was another attempt to quit our... Let's remember though... Let's remember, Ruffians, this was Moco-chan's best attempt today to eat the natto.

32:15.822 --> 32:16.523
Yeah, and let's do...

32:20.845 --> 32:21.906
You can't tell me no sleep.

32:22.026 --> 32:24.608
I get to sleep.

32:24.868 --> 32:33.674
But, Ruffians, let's use Moco-chan's attempt just now to power ourselves through all the hard things we may have to face this week.

32:33.734 --> 32:34.194
It better.

32:34.214 --> 32:36.536
That's a threat.

32:36.556 --> 32:37.857
BAU BAU!

32:37.877 --> 32:41.639
I want to be able to eat natto.

32:42.159 --> 32:42.520
You do?

32:43.720 --> 32:44.881
I'm not forcing you.

32:44.981 --> 32:46.503
I'm doing my best.

32:46.563 --> 32:48.865
You better do your best too, Ruffians, okay?

32:49.546 --> 32:50.087
It's a threat.

32:50.707 --> 32:53.130
BAU BAU!

32:53.470 --> 32:58.335
Well, let's go to our regular corners that Moco-chan just wanted to jump right through to.

32:58.355 --> 33:04.041
And I can understand because I have a feeling today's Doggie of the Day might be cute.

33:04.758 --> 33:07.160
De-den!

33:07.480 --> 33:10.022
We have two doggies of the day today!

33:10.583 --> 33:13.685
Samson and Sassofrass!

33:13.705 --> 33:14.606
Sassofrass!

33:15.567 --> 33:17.928
I don't know Moco-chan, they're kind of like us, right?

33:18.329 --> 33:18.869
Are they?

33:19.189 --> 33:20.330
Don't you think, Ruffians?

33:21.551 --> 33:22.432
I'm Sassafras.

33:23.193 --> 33:24.714
Are you sure you're not Sassafras?

33:24.754 --> 33:25.435
You're Samson.

33:25.495 --> 33:26.556
I think I'm Sassafras.

33:26.596 --> 33:27.517
No, I'm Samson.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.279
You're Samson.

33:30.559 --> 33:31.941
But they're not twins, though.

33:31.981 --> 33:32.921
They're not twins.

33:33.322 --> 33:36.264
They're half-siblings, so a little bit different.

33:36.284 --> 33:42.490
I don't know, when I see all the wrinkles, I want to just take my finger and sort of unwrinkle the forehead wrinkles.

33:43.471 --> 33:44.211
In a cute way.

33:46.781 --> 33:47.482
Goodbye wrinkles.

33:47.502 --> 33:50.384
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

33:50.965 --> 33:52.086
Thank you.

33:52.106 --> 33:55.088
And Moco-chan, they're good at begging too.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.371
Right, but Ruffians as demon dogs, you know.

33:58.391 --> 34:00.492
We kinda, we have pride.

34:00.953 --> 34:03.355
We have pride enough not to stoop to those levels.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.175
Yeah.

34:04.636 --> 34:06.778
Not unless we really need to, you know.

34:08.247 --> 34:14.511
But I think if I need to, I can convince you with my puppy dog eye begging skills.

34:15.172 --> 34:15.532
Right!

34:16.212 --> 34:17.933
Are you gonna show us, Moco-chan?

34:22.056 --> 34:23.257
No, not right now.

34:23.597 --> 34:24.798
Yeah.

34:25.218 --> 34:26.839
Well, how do they BAU BAU?

34:27.559 --> 34:33.303
Maybe like... You know, sometimes when Moco-chan, you get kind of worked up over something, then...

34:34.192 --> 34:36.873
You start BAU BAUing, I start BAU BAUing.

34:36.933 --> 34:38.093
Oh, like when we cry.

34:38.113 --> 34:40.154
Yeah, like when we cry, right?

34:40.194 --> 34:42.875
You know it never ends, like... Alright, like that.

34:53.119 --> 34:54.360
But you know what?

34:54.880 --> 34:55.781
I can tell.

34:56.201 --> 35:01.004
I can tell from this photo that Samus and Sassafras are a bit of a handful.

35:01.024 --> 35:03.625
I mean, look at those eyes!

35:03.705 --> 35:05.686
They're so fit!

35:06.347 --> 35:07.327
They're cute.

35:07.447 --> 35:08.328
They're cute, you know?

35:08.368 --> 35:09.348
But they demand.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.109
They demand.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.449
And they're cute!

35:11.810 --> 35:12.110
Yeah!

35:12.350 --> 35:14.271
And in return, they love.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.072
They're very cute!

35:17.373 --> 35:19.454
BAU BAU BAU!

35:20.728 --> 35:23.990
Wow, you know now it's getting a bit cold outside.

35:24.111 --> 35:29.575
But yet Ruffians are still going out for walks!

35:29.755 --> 35:30.716
Good, good.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.378
Why did this Ruffian go for a walk this time?

35:33.538 --> 35:34.238
De-den!

35:34.278 --> 35:40.223
You found an old watermill along a nature trail!

35:45.094 --> 35:47.296
Can we say it together, Moco-chan?

36:10.891 --> 36:15.274
Resident Evil 4 Remake, right?

36:15.794 --> 36:23.059
But, I don't know, like, it's not really like that it's scary or creepy or that zombies are going to really pop out.

36:23.159 --> 36:28.943
But, you know, it's just somehow RE4 Remake has really beautiful environments.

36:28.963 --> 36:30.864
It feels like a good autumn walk, right?

36:30.944 --> 36:33.986
And that's why it kind of reminds us of it, maybe?

36:34.651 --> 36:40.214
Yeah, but hopefully it's just a nice walk and there's no grandma or grandpa zombies that pop out at you.

36:40.354 --> 36:40.614
No!

36:42.075 --> 36:42.655
Safety.

36:43.696 --> 36:44.936
BAU BAU!

36:44.997 --> 36:47.178
Please be safe, look out for zombies.

36:50.419 --> 36:53.021
We got a Question of the Day from a Ruffian.

36:53.801 --> 36:54.481
Let's see.

36:54.762 --> 36:56.182
De-den!

36:56.703 --> 36:58.624
Good morning to my favorite doggos!

36:58.664 --> 37:00.064
Good morning!

37:00.365 --> 37:02.246
I'm taking two grades of Aiken.

37:02.326 --> 37:04.347
The English proficiency test is tomorrow.

37:04.367 --> 37:07.908
So maybe you've already taken it by now.

37:08.089 --> 37:08.969
Satsumeshi karakushi.

37:08.989 --> 37:10.750
Oh, what a weird test.

37:10.970 --> 37:13.452
These tests are important, especially this kind of test, right?

37:13.792 --> 37:16.834
These tests will quite literally decide my future.

37:17.394 --> 37:20.757
My question is, have you guys gotten anxious about a test?

37:21.097 --> 37:24.019
If so, how did you deal with it?

37:24.039 --> 37:25.220
It's a good question.

37:25.240 --> 37:29.463
We hope that your A-game went well and smoothly!

37:29.503 --> 37:37.188
We hope you weren't too nervous about it either, but we understand what it's kind of like to have tests that are super important like that too.

37:39.617 --> 37:43.440
We've had experiences where we're really nervous about tests a lot.

37:44.902 --> 37:51.708
Actually, there was one class that we had as a part of our guard dog training and it was really rough.

37:52.789 --> 37:54.070
It wasn't going well.

37:54.951 --> 37:55.771
At all.

37:55.831 --> 38:00.035
But we were studying really really hard the whole time and we studied really hard for the exam.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.096
The final exam.

38:01.156 --> 38:03.098
But it just wasn't making any sense.

38:03.558 --> 38:05.820
We were just really exhausted.

38:07.705 --> 38:15.551
Right before the exam, we were kind of debating whether we should just give up, stop right there, and just turn back home.

38:16.852 --> 38:24.417
You know that it may just be a bit easier if we didn't go to the exam, just fail the final, fail the class, you know?

38:24.817 --> 38:29.221
Because even if we did go to the final, we'd still most likely fail.

38:30.121 --> 38:32.123
But in the end, Ruffians,

38:33.012 --> 38:34.793
We both decided to breathe in!

38:34.853 --> 38:35.234
Why?

38:35.334 --> 38:36.275
I take it every minute.

38:36.295 --> 38:37.496
Yeah, very last minute.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.017
I kid to you.

38:39.137 --> 38:40.178
Can you tell what happened?

38:42.136 --> 38:43.617
It wasn't math, but it's okay.

38:44.117 --> 38:45.578
It wasn't.

38:47.299 --> 38:47.979
You know what?

38:49.119 --> 38:50.440
We had to do a passing!

38:50.580 --> 38:50.920
Yeah.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.201
Yeah.

38:52.241 --> 38:55.042
So, but if we had given up then... It wouldn't happen.

38:55.082 --> 38:55.443
Right?

38:56.823 --> 38:58.184
Exactly, we passed.

38:58.204 --> 38:59.925
So, you know, just believe in yourself.

39:00.005 --> 39:00.885
Don't be nervous.

39:00.985 --> 39:02.426
Just do your best, okay?

39:02.466 --> 39:03.166
Do your best.

39:03.206 --> 39:03.987
You can do it.

39:04.027 --> 39:04.327
Yeah!

39:04.927 --> 39:05.408
BAU BAU!

39:26.530 --> 39:30.171
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today.

39:30.191 --> 39:36.353
We'd like you to remember that FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make all together with you, Ruffians.

39:36.633 --> 39:47.517
So if you have any doggy of the days or questions, you know, those kind of things, please submit them to us with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

39:47.557 --> 39:48.777
BAU BAU!

39:54.132 --> 39:55.192
Next!

39:55.592 --> 39:57.233
What do we have for our next stream?

39:57.473 --> 39:57.993
It's a Monday.

39:58.013 --> 39:59.894
It's the start of the week.

40:01.094 --> 40:03.095
But... De-den!

40:03.135 --> 40:04.816
We have... De-den!

40:05.829 --> 40:08.851
This time, it's the end.

40:32.667 --> 40:36.755
Yeah, we're gonna do our best to get past these last few levels.

40:36.955 --> 40:39.420
They're very, very tricky, very difficult.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.103
Very different from the rest of the game, huh?

40:43.403 --> 40:43.623
Yeah.

40:43.683 --> 40:46.704
It's called Very Very Very Chicken now.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.804
But I think, you know, there's two of us!

40:48.944 --> 40:49.284
Yeah!

40:49.504 --> 40:51.165
Through cooperation together.

40:51.185 --> 40:52.845
And me taking your controller.

40:54.026 --> 40:54.946
I think we can do it.

40:55.006 --> 40:57.707
We can become the strongest duo ever, right?

40:57.787 --> 40:58.387
Right!

40:58.827 --> 41:01.248
Please help us, Ruffians.

41:01.348 --> 41:03.768
We're really gonna need your help, okay?

41:03.888 --> 41:04.388
We are!

41:04.468 --> 41:05.689
We need to do this!

41:05.829 --> 41:06.089
Yeah.

41:06.369 --> 41:06.889
Okay.

41:07.309 --> 41:09.830
Yeah, we're gonna take down the dude.

41:11.411 --> 41:12.732
BAU BAU!

41:12.912 --> 41:14.152
And our schedule!

41:14.773 --> 41:17.494
Well, we have a very exciting week.

41:18.694 --> 41:20.515
There's a lot coming up.

41:21.155 --> 41:22.896
A lot of spookiness.

41:24.256 --> 41:34.900
And you know, if you notice, even though FUWAMOCO Morning on a Friday is... Well, it's October Friday the 13th, right?

41:34.960 --> 41:38.462
So you can never be too sure what will happen.

41:40.287 --> 41:42.329
You have to be there, Ruffians!

41:42.529 --> 41:42.849
I guess.

41:43.430 --> 41:44.411
I guess.

41:45.351 --> 41:46.112
Thank you.

41:46.172 --> 41:52.177
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for the 30th FUWAMOCO Morning.

41:52.918 --> 41:58.963
Thank you, and hopefully we'll be able to enjoy many, many more FUWAMOCO Mornings all together.

41:59.304 --> 42:00.084
Would you like that?

42:01.212 --> 42:02.113
I hope you like that.

42:02.433 --> 42:03.555
Because that's the plan.

42:03.675 --> 42:04.496
That's the plan!

42:04.516 --> 42:11.904
But before we say BAU BAU for that, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today.

42:12.345 --> 42:12.905

42:36.778 --> 42:38.058

42:38.418 --> 42:43.940
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

42:44.581 --> 42:47.762
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

42:47.782 --> 42:49.342
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

42:49.402 --> 42:50.783
BAU BAU!

42:54.244 --> 42:54.912
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!
