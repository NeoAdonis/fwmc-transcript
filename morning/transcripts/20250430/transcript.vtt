00:04:47.648 --> 00:04:52.984
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:58.080
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:03.415
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:07.061
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.066
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:12.049
BAU BAU!

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:18.178
And today we will host a FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:18.799
Huh?

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.201
It's totally normal, no squeaking.

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.983
No!

00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:29.954
Squeaking is normal because today is the 151st episode!

00:05:29.974 --> 00:05:32.357
I thought you were gonna make a mistake.

00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:32.437
No.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:36.182
BAU BAU, thank you for joining us waking up early!

00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:38.906
BAU BAU!

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:39.607
Yeah!

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:41.449
Especially if you went to sleep so early.

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:45.960
Biboo, you had lots and lots of fun yesterday, Ruffians!

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:50.973
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:52.256
Thank you!

00:05:52.517 --> 00:05:54.722
I think I see a few Ruffians.

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:57.750
Maybe today is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.416
Maybe you're a little bit confused like what is this FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:02.197
It's simple.

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:02.798
Wow!

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:11.252
For those joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:13.195
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:16.600
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:22.049
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.451
Now remember,

00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:25.934
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:29.197
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:33.482
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:33.862 --> 00:06:36.205
BAU BAU!

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:37.286
It's a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:38.847
Good morning!

00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:40.329
You went to sleep and you woke up?

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.890
Yes!

00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:44.153
BAU BAU!

00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:48.498
We hope that you're feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day of love with us.

00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:49.759
Maybe if you're not.

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:53.239
Hopefully this will help a bit.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.761
A smidgen of a bit.

00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.883
Just a smidgen of a bit.

00:06:56.964 --> 00:06:57.805
It'll make us happy.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:01.890
Well you know, Moco-chan.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.251
You didn't sleep?

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:05.114
Well, hopefully this gives you some more energy!

00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:08.259
This is the best way to start the day!

00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:10.642
BAU BAU!

00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:13.165
It's the best way for us to start our day.

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:17.627
BAU BAU!

00:07:17.647 --> 00:07:21.553
FUWAMOCO-chan, this is the part that we all kind of feel a little bit disappointed, right?

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:30.584
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:31.145
Ruffians!

00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:43.962
Where was Pero Sighted this time, Moco-chan?

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:52.021
No Ruffians fighting panel on!

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:52.885
No fighting.

00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:54.090
No!

00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:55.074
Huh?

00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:55.396
Yes.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:56.922
Oh!

00:07:57.813 --> 00:08:00.676
That's good, you know, we don't need any more nasty ones.

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:01.657
What?

00:08:02.478 --> 00:08:02.879
Nani?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:03.840
No.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.400
No?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.463
No, we don't need any more nasty ones.

00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:08.765
No, it's a nice break, you know.

00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:11.448
Only fluffy and fuzzy today, right?

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:12.990
Is he okay?

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.590
Does he need a hug?

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.694
This fool has been defeated, yes!

00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:18.516
Hug fluffies, are you sure?

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:20.438
I think that's gonna be really dangerous.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.980
He's been defeated for Wednesday.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.821
You miss him!

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:23.982
Miss him!

00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:26.925
Am I hoarding something?

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:28.488
I don't know.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.739
That's a lot of credit you're giving him there.

00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:34.665
Is FUWAMOCO gonna eat Pero?

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:36.249
Do you think he eats garbage?

00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:43.007
You're saying that we would like to eat garbage and I feel slightly insulted, Ruffians.

00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:53.740
Well, well.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:13.350
A day with a little more... Nastiness.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.450
Yes.

00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:20.402
BAU BAU!

00:09:20.422 --> 00:09:24.410
Pero's definitely a marshmallow.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.073
I think you're very confused.

00:09:26.113 --> 00:09:27.796
She's definitely a demon dog.

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:35.050
Pero seed marshmallow set.

00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:42.061
Then you can go camping, and then put him on the campfire and watch him melt away!

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:46.892
Or then you can, you know, put him in your mug and then put boiling hot water on him!

00:09:46.912 --> 00:09:48.516
Delicious and sort of violent.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.666
BAU BAU!

00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:12.343
Let's get on to the rest of the day!

00:10:13.032 --> 00:10:20.582
Today is the day, you know, that my very beloved Soic-senpai!

00:10:20.682 --> 00:10:21.964
Greta-senpai!

00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:25.789
This is the last day that she's here with us in hololive.

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.596
You know, it's really hard to say goodbye.

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:40.069
Especially, you know, there's still so much we wanted to do, to be able to talk about with her, you know, just everything together with Greta-senpai, but...

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.373
She held her last karaoke stream yesterday and it was beautiful!

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:52.184
We were able to listen to a bit of it.

00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:53.046
I'm really happy.

00:10:53.684 --> 00:10:57.509
But in case you missed it as well!

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:02.095
Gura-senpai, she released her last big project the other day!

00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:05.861
A brand new original song called Ash Again.

00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:11.308
Created together with Casey Edwards known for his game music and Devil May Cry.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:12.490
Have you listened?

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.115
It was amazing.

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:18.578
Not only is it an incredible song,

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:26.249
Wow, but the animation, the feelings, the emotion, just everything's so raw.

00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:27.430
It's so beautiful.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.452
It's super powerful.

00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:34.060
It's just a breathtaking mass performance by Gura-senpai.

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.905
So if you haven't checked it out, it's so much to go.

00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:40.088
Yeah, please go get it too, okay?

00:11:40.108 --> 00:11:45.696
And I'm sure you know Gura-senpai would be very happy that you watched it today too, so.

00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:48.099
BAU BAU!

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.402
Thank you Gura-senpai!

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:51.483
BAU BAU!

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:51.823
But!

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.826
Before!

00:11:55.268 --> 00:12:00.194
There's gonna be a very special Myth Club Relay!

00:12:00.214 --> 00:12:04.138
Happening before Gura-senpai has her very last graduation scene!

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:05.100
And!

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.042
We'll have some new moves!

00:12:07.402 --> 00:12:12.088
It seems like it's going to be starting over on Calli-senpai's channel!

00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:15.815
At 1pm PT or 5am JST.

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:17.357
They'll be playing Minecraft.

00:12:17.377 --> 00:12:18.780
I think.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.020
I think.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.681
Minecraft.

00:12:20.663 --> 00:12:21.625
Yes.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:28.517
And then, they will continue over to Kiara-senpai's channel at 2pm PT, 6am JST.

00:12:28.857 --> 00:12:31.562
Playing Jackbox Games.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:42.238
FUWAMOCO And then, continuing with our train over to Ina-senpai's channel starting at 3pm, 7am JST, they're gonna be playing Gang Beasts!

00:12:44.342 --> 00:12:48.488
FUWAMOCO And then, FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO FUWAMOCO

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:51.011
I think they have another small collab?

00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:51.932
I don't know.

00:12:51.953 --> 00:12:55.097
I'm not too sure, but I'm looking forward to it.

00:12:55.177 --> 00:13:00.283
That will be from 4pm PT to 4pm- 430pm!

00:13:00.303 --> 00:13:00.764
4pm 30?

00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:02.646
PT!

00:13:03.107 --> 00:13:11.017
And then Gura-senpai's final 3D Mini Live will be happening at 5pm PT, 9am TST.

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:13.260
So let's all

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:21.934
See Gra-senpai off with a smile.

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:25.849
Let's say thank you from the very depths of our hearts.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.535
The depths of our hearts ocean.

00:13:30.816 --> 00:13:32.979
BAU BAU!

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.426
Calli stream starts very soon in about 4 hours.

00:13:38.446 --> 00:13:40.448
The relay starts soon.

00:13:40.468 --> 00:13:43.332
I'm gonna send you over there, okay?

00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:49.738
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:57.388
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:57.468 --> 00:14:07.902
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:14:07.882 --> 00:14:09.224
Special pop-up store.

00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:10.666
What does it take to go there?

00:14:10.686 --> 00:14:11.627
What is it?

00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:12.629
Right now!

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.971
It's free!

00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:15.873
You don't need any tickets to visit.

00:14:15.894 --> 00:14:18.818
You can just walk right on in!

00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:24.947
And there you know, there's special merch in these zero gravity battle outfits here.

00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:31.135
Acrylics, tapestries, a bunch of different cool things to be able to buy in the store there.

00:14:31.276 --> 00:14:34.100
And because it's a pop-up, it's limited time, okay?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.403
It will pop up and then it will be gone.

00:14:36.383 --> 00:14:41.030
And it ends on May 29th, so you still have some time.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:46.237
Maybe you're planning a Japan trip, or maybe you have a friend who's planning a Japan trip.

00:14:46.297 --> 00:14:47.439
You can pop on by.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:49.762
You know what?

00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:50.423
But!

00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:51.945
We talked about this.

00:14:52.046 --> 00:14:54.169
There's one important thing.

00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:57.353
There's an important thing at this pop-up shop.

00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.416
We can't get away though!

00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:02.120
At this pop-up shop, you can meet FUWAMOCO!

00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:04.163
Yes!

00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:09.808
FIGURE!

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:13.353
One one skill, life size, FUWAMOCO!

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.717
In resin, in figure.

00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:19.021
We're not so rough with you because you can't touch, we ask.

00:15:20.784 --> 00:15:21.465
Because you don't!

00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:22.527
Did you notice?

00:15:23.148 --> 00:15:24.209
At the bottom of it!

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.913
Not that bottom there.

00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:28.075
That's our...

00:15:29.523 --> 00:15:57.572
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:58.936 --> 00:15:59.657
It was a chance.

00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:01.059
Moco-chan.

00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:04.023
I have a photo nobody else has.

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:06.206
Huh?

00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:06.947
Of who, Moco-chan?

00:16:11.594 --> 00:16:14.158
It's a chance!

00:16:14.178 --> 00:16:15.199
How could you do that in front of Mari-chan?

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:17.923
I don't think the Ruffians can walk around.

00:16:18.072 --> 00:16:21.097
You know, the Ruffians are not able to walk around.

00:16:21.117 --> 00:16:21.778
I did it at the last moment.

00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:25.984
I think everyone had their back turned.

00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:28.829
But there's a lot of surprises.

00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:34.298
And what was most surprising, especially to Moco-chan, you know, we got handed the pens.

00:16:34.578 --> 00:16:39.085
FUWAMOCO please, if you could, if you could sign the base of the stand.

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:47.419
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:48.501 --> 00:17:00.702
Have a howl of a day!

00:17:00.682 --> 00:17:10.046
And always 1-1 scale is very impressive, but I feel like often the painting leaves a bit to be desired.

00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:12.111
You know, but you're like, oh it's 1-1 scale, you know?

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:12.432
It's a pain.

00:17:13.775 --> 00:17:14.978
This is not that.

00:17:15.464 --> 00:17:16.465
This is amazing!

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:21.870
This is the most amazing 1-1 scale figure I have ever seen.

00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:24.773
Quite possibly that could ever be created, you know?

00:17:24.973 --> 00:17:26.134
Absolutely unbiased.

00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:29.217
The translucent materials!

00:17:29.658 --> 00:17:31.099
Yes!

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:31.739
Yes!

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:31.840
Yes!

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.380
Yes!

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.001
You know, the airbrushing!

00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:33.922
The airbrushing is amazing!

00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:34.702
The sculpting!

00:17:35.023 --> 00:17:36.084
The use of materials!

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.586
You know, just looking at all the angles!

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:39.507
Every angle!

00:17:39.527 --> 00:17:40.067
Everything!

00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:41.088
Everything is beautiful!

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:42.290
Did you look at the nails?

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.851
I looked at the nails.

00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:45.392
We looked in the shoes.

00:17:45.452 --> 00:17:47.155
Did you look behind the jacket?

00:17:47.395 --> 00:17:49.658
We looked, we looked, we looked and looked and looked.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:52.341
And then finally, we got handed the pen.

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:55.546
And that was where the panic started.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:59.351
Moco-chan got the sign first, which was a mistake.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.413
I don't think anyone looked at the signature right.

00:18:01.553 --> 00:18:04.097
Moco-chan's like, I have to make sure I do this right.

00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:05.779
I only get one chance.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.843
Could you imagine if I made a mistake?

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:31.050
Moco-chan already had the pen down on the stand.

00:18:32.482 --> 00:18:33.986
FUWAMOCO-chan fashion.

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:37.875
You need to press down on the pen really hard.

00:18:37.895 --> 00:18:39.058
I flooded it!

00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:39.780
I flooded the zero.

00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:41.424
The circle.

00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:41.985
No!

00:18:43.168 --> 00:18:43.670
The what?

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.000
The big puddle in the middle of it.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.702
I flooded it!

00:18:48.682 --> 00:18:50.305
Oh no!

00:18:50.325 --> 00:18:50.746
Oh no!

00:18:50.986 --> 00:18:54.833
And then I picked up the pen and then it dropped everywhere!

00:18:54.933 --> 00:19:00.203
It just... I looked up and the staff was like... What do I do?

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:01.926
What do I do?

00:19:01.946 --> 00:19:05.473
Moco-chan's panicking and the staff is like... What do we do?

00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:06.174
What do we do?

00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:07.456
We can't... We can't wipe it.

00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:08.879
We can't... No.

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:09.139
No.

00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:10.902
No.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:11.263
Continue.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.142
It just continued.

00:19:13.162 --> 00:19:19.471
And then I made it into a... Yeah, FUWAMOCO's suggestion, right, Moco-chan?

00:19:20.252 --> 00:19:21.154
I'll make a mistake.

00:19:21.234 --> 00:19:21.815
Cute.

00:19:22.075 --> 00:19:26.061
And that's why it's called BAU BAU.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:31.188
I tried!

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.311
Looks like a baseball player.

00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:36.355
Do baseball players make mistakes like this all the time?

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.580
All the time!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.424
I just... I pushed down on the pen a lot.

00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:46.107
The mistake makes it cuter!

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:48.590
You were wondering!

00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:48.951
Huh?

00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:52.736
You were wondering what happened here.

00:19:53.858 --> 00:19:54.979
It's a pretty easy story.

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:56.902
What was the issue, Mococo?

00:19:57.222 --> 00:19:57.743
What was the issue?

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:01.768
Mococo doesn't just press down as hard as she can when she writes her signature.

00:20:01.788 --> 00:20:06.034
That was the issue.

00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:07.556
I tried.

00:20:07.576 --> 00:20:07.997
Yeah.

00:20:08.838 --> 00:20:12.765
Meanwhile, my signature came out just as I had planned!

00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:17.033
I should've went first though.

00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:18.095
You should've went first.

00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:19.317
I was just about to say that.

00:20:22.984 --> 00:20:24.567
Do we have any other nice photos?

00:20:24.587 --> 00:20:26.691
Do we have any other photos?

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:31.199
Moco-chan, do you have a favorite spot that the Ruffians can take a nice closeup look at?

00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:32.922
I have a bunch of closeups.

00:20:32.902 --> 00:20:35.725
There are a lot more close-ups online as well!

00:20:35.945 --> 00:20:37.968
You can see other Ruffians posting lots of photos!

00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:39.570
It's a little bit embarrassing, huh?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.071
You know, close-up.

00:20:41.412 --> 00:20:44.015
My tummy, everything's clinging and you know.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.977
But the material used is very cute!

00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:48.700
Yeah, you know, and the staff is always like, look!

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.681
Look, Fuwawa!

00:20:49.701 --> 00:20:51.583
We worked so hard to be able to do this!

00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:54.927
Make your belly button!

00:20:54.947 --> 00:20:56.008
Look at the belly button!

00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:57.130
Look at the belly button!

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.073
Trust me, we know this.

00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:16.200
The mouth is also very cute, the depth inside the mouth.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.443
Look inside the mouth, okay?

00:21:17.463 --> 00:21:18.184
And then Moco-chan!

00:21:18.204 --> 00:21:21.291
Moco-chan's mouth is so cute too!

00:21:21.372 --> 00:21:30.111
And also, you probably can't see that well, but if you look behind the jacket, you know, sort of in between the armpit and the jacket, it's also very interesting too!

00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:33.315
Lots of different places to look!

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.177
Very cute!

00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:42.126
You have to go if you can and take a look at Fursuit Ruffians!

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:43.447
Very very recommended!

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:49.034
Even if you think it's just a pop-up store, I'm not really interested in it anymore.

00:21:49.114 --> 00:21:50.416
Please go see it, okay?

00:21:51.037 --> 00:21:53.820
But we have good news for Ruffians!

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.522
I'm gonna be able to!

00:21:57.185 --> 00:22:02.652
Right now, you can pre-order your own 1-7-6 FUWAMOCO figures!

00:22:03.353 --> 00:22:05.496
All thanks to Design Coco!

00:22:05.516 --> 00:22:07.058
Design Coco made these works of art!

00:22:07.138 --> 00:22:09.521
You can pre-order them right now!

00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:12.124
You can get them on AmiAmi too!

00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:16.751
And we know some Ruffians have been concerned and we understand.

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:18.373
We understand.

00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:23.740
They are not the um... What's the word?

00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:30.383
They are difficult to get in your prize because of the price point.

00:22:30.403 --> 00:22:32.587
Yeah, you know, but they work so hard.

00:22:32.688 --> 00:22:38.279
But it's very understandable because there is a very... What's the word?

00:22:38.419 --> 00:22:38.539
Gouka?

00:22:39.953 --> 00:22:47.304
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:23:05.792
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:05.772 --> 00:23:10.462
Important point that these are made to order.

00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:17.477
If you don't pre-order, it's gonna get really hard to be able to get your password afterwards.

00:23:17.497 --> 00:23:20.023
We have made this mistake many, many times, okay?

00:23:20.664 --> 00:23:22.508
Because you think, oh, I'll just get it later.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:24.793
Somebody will part with it maybe.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:40.647
The good news is that you have 3 months to be able to decide.

00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:44.012
You know, talk things over with your wallet maybe.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:51.240
But if you want to see them closer!

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.802
Super cute right?

00:23:52.822 --> 00:23:55.225
BAU BAU!

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:57.187
I can't wait to get a paw somebody.

00:23:57.728 --> 00:23:59.370
Trust me Ruffians.

00:24:03.772 --> 00:24:17.603
We do our best, but... But we also noticed too, Ruffians, that it seems like over at AmiAmi, that we are in the ranking for the Bishoujo for the cute girl figures!

00:24:17.984 --> 00:24:18.064
Yes!

00:24:18.105 --> 00:24:19.107
Bishoujo figures!

00:24:19.127 --> 00:24:19.748
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:21.392
We are local right there!

00:24:21.372 --> 00:24:37.120
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:57.589
BAU BAU!

00:24:57.569 --> 00:24:58.831
If you're like, I can't.

00:24:59.171 --> 00:24:59.712
It's okay.

00:25:00.273 --> 00:25:00.833
Because!

00:25:01.354 --> 00:25:02.616
There is this!

00:25:03.737 --> 00:25:03.837
Yeah!

00:25:03.897 --> 00:25:06.241
Right now if you go over to Twitter.

00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:06.341
Yes!

00:25:06.541 --> 00:25:10.026
And you follow the A.S.K.L.I.T.E account and then you repost this.

00:25:10.046 --> 00:25:11.307
This post with this image.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:11.788
Yes!

00:25:11.808 --> 00:25:16.955
And I will, after... After FUWAMOCO Morning, I will point you to this tweet.

00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:17.055
Yes!

00:25:17.396 --> 00:25:22.643
If you do this, then you could win both Fuwawa and Mococo!

00:25:22.663 --> 00:25:22.783
Yes!

00:25:22.803 --> 00:25:25.106
I'm doing a special giveaway for it.

00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:26.648
So, you know, if...

00:25:26.628 --> 00:25:38.072
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:41.539
BAU BAU!

00:25:42.882 --> 00:25:44.606
BAU BAU!

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.753
We hope you're the best Ruffians!

00:25:47.773 --> 00:25:51.220
I'm just really excited, so I wanted to talk a bunch about that.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.962
We really really love figures.

00:25:52.904 --> 00:25:53.125
Yeah.

00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:57.053
And I really, really like all the materials.

00:25:57.073 --> 00:25:58.697
And I love our outfits and everything.

00:25:59.518 --> 00:25:59.619
Yeah.

00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:00.280
Just really excited.

00:26:00.732 --> 00:26:03.375
BAU BAU!

00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:04.617
BAU BAU!

00:26:04.637 --> 00:26:07.240
And I'm speaking of other things that are really big and life-size.

00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:08.382
Almost life-size.

00:26:08.422 --> 00:26:08.742
Big!

00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:09.042
Big!

00:26:09.423 --> 00:26:10.144
We're talking about big.

00:26:10.184 --> 00:26:12.146
This is a big episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:26:12.587 --> 00:26:14.149
It's not life-size.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.831
But it's big!

00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:21.258
The biggest plushies yet of FUWAMOCO!

00:26:21.278 --> 00:26:25.423
I have both!

00:26:25.657 --> 00:26:30.287
I'm about to descend on the earth.

00:26:30.307 --> 00:26:35.538
We have these rapid-burning plushies from Abyssgard!

00:26:35.558 --> 00:26:36.119
Look at us!

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:38.725
They're sitting on the pond, eating donuts!

00:26:38.745 --> 00:26:41.090
You may think looking at this, that this is a plushie.

00:26:41.852 --> 00:26:42.693
It's just a plushie.

00:26:42.814 --> 00:26:46.281
I don't have anything for scale, I think for the photo.

00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:57.497
Sitting down at this size, I think they are 53 centimeters tall.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.085
I don't know what that is though, really.

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:02.848
That's okay, Ruffians!

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:13.138
We have had the pleasure to be able to get many many of these FUWAMOCOs, FUWAMOCO buddies and be able to overlook them.

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:14.420
Overlook, you know.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.483
Give them lots of head pats and hugs.

00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:18.364
They are big!

00:27:18.384 --> 00:27:19.305
They are hefty!

00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:24.810
At one point, I thought I was being overrun by them in a wonderful way.

00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:26.612
But, okay.

00:27:26.592 --> 00:27:28.094
They're so detailed.

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:31.319
And then, this is the special thing.

00:27:31.339 --> 00:27:33.242
They give very, very special hugs.

00:27:33.482 --> 00:27:34.344
Very good hugs.

00:27:34.724 --> 00:27:36.126
It's like, they're happy.

00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:38.189
It's like a big child.

00:27:44.158 --> 00:27:46.241
You know, it's a plushie, right?

00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:47.704
What's so special about it?

00:27:47.724 --> 00:27:56.076
I don't know, when I just kind of picked up Moco-chan and gave Moco-chan a hug, just kind of like a tear came to my eyes.

00:27:56.714 --> 00:28:04.776
It felt special.

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:10.993
I feel like if you need a hug, then it's probably pretty good.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.997
So, as you know, you can take off the jackets, too!

00:28:16.418 --> 00:28:22.307
There's a detachable jacket, headphones, and clothes, too, you know.

00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:24.230
I was just amazed by all the details.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.253
All the love that's went into these.

00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:26.934
The stitching.

00:28:27.595 --> 00:28:32.442
Yeah, so we hope both of you feel like, well, plushies, plushies are my thing.

00:28:32.662 --> 00:28:35.226
If you like big plushies, this is your time.

00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:37.430
It will not be on a shelf, okay?

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:38.331
No.

00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:42.723
No, this is not a plushie you put on the shelf unless you happen to have ginormous shelves.

00:28:43.605 --> 00:28:46.593
Yes, this is like it sits on its own chair.

00:28:46.653 --> 00:28:49.621
This plushie demands a big portion of your home.

00:28:51.807 --> 00:28:53.130
Okay.

00:28:54.072 --> 00:28:55.495
This would be in a chair.

00:28:55.535 --> 00:28:59.362
A chair is a good place.

00:29:00.183 --> 00:29:01.646
I think it's very comparable.

00:29:02.187 --> 00:29:02.788
Comparable?

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:03.850
It has a presence.

00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:07.036
It has a presence, yes.

00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:11.524
I don't think... Maybe not paying rent size, but...

00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:13.684
Imposing.

00:29:14.204 --> 00:29:17.148
At the very least, paying some of the grocery bills.

00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:18.850
Helping out with chores.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.691
Yes.

00:29:19.972 --> 00:29:21.814
Maybe not paying rent.

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:22.195
Okay.

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:24.538
It commands pondering well.

00:29:24.918 --> 00:29:27.621
It also comes with a place pondering as well.

00:29:28.463 --> 00:29:29.063
You're in luck.

00:29:29.604 --> 00:29:30.285
Please check it out.

00:29:30.305 --> 00:29:33.729
You can get your paws on it over on Vivistar's website.

00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:38.195
BAU BAU!

00:29:38.215 --> 00:29:39.396
Not entirely.

00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:40.718
That would mean rent.

00:29:40.698 --> 00:29:50.775
This is a big episode of FUWAMOCO Morning, Ruffians!

00:29:51.194 --> 00:29:57.962
It's been a while, but it's the time of the week!

00:29:58.803 --> 00:29:59.063
Ruffians!

00:29:59.263 --> 00:30:00.885
Moco-chan.

00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:07.153
After what feels like it's been a very long time, Moco-chan is back!

00:30:07.493 --> 00:30:12.078
Moco-chan's challenge is back!

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:13.981
BAU BAU!

00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:16.864
You know it!

00:30:16.844 --> 00:30:17.765
Pup Talk?

00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:18.806
No!

00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:22.009
It's time for Moco-chan's challenge, you know.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:32.820
You know, it's been a while, so we want to be able to see just how much Moco-chan has grown and eating in the time since Anato Corner has been away, right?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.001
Right, Ruffians?

00:30:35.322 --> 00:30:36.143
Yeah, challenge.

00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:37.845
Yeah.

00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:39.146
Yeah.

00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:43.290
So you know, today Moco-chan, you're going to challenge something.

00:30:43.726 --> 00:30:46.792
That you've never done before!

00:30:46.812 --> 00:30:48.736
Even though you know it's the middle of the week.

00:30:48.756 --> 00:30:51.862
In the beginning of the week.

00:30:51.882 --> 00:30:52.103
Challenge!

00:30:52.123 --> 00:30:56.572
You know, and then you'll be ready to challenge something new this week, huh?

00:30:56.592 --> 00:30:57.413
I love you!

00:30:57.433 --> 00:31:00.700
Because Moco-chan, that's what you're doing.

00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:04.367
And so today Moco-chan, you're probably curious what you're gonna be trying, right?

00:31:06.102 --> 00:31:12.853
So today, Moco-chan, you're going to be challenging BILA!

00:31:12.873 --> 00:31:14.636
BAU BAU!

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:22.890
BILA is also known as a loquat fruit.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:29.781
It's yellow and orange and soft, maybe a little fuzzy too.

00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:32.024
Yeah, apparently... You know what?

00:31:32.044 --> 00:31:33.246
It tastes interesting.

00:31:33.646 --> 00:31:34.728
We're not gonna spoil it.

00:31:34.848 --> 00:31:36.130
Abiwa.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:36.731
Yeah, abiwa.

00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:39.194
A loquat fruit.

00:31:39.214 --> 00:31:39.314
Yeah.

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:41.057
No, no, Mocomo!

00:31:42.158 --> 00:31:54.055
Hey, you know, but Moco-chan is going to try something new and hopefully, you know, with that spirit of challenge, you know, you can continue to do your best and protect the Ruffian smile for many, many years to come, you know.

00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:56.038
Just like me.

00:31:56.018 --> 00:31:58.120
As I eat my natto daily.

00:32:00.583 --> 00:32:01.224
It's sweet, right?

00:32:01.344 --> 00:32:01.804
So I'm good.

00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:02.665
Right?

00:32:02.685 --> 00:32:05.248
Just because it's a fruit doesn't mean it's sweet, Moco-chan.

00:32:05.268 --> 00:32:07.410
I've never had this before.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.313
How confident are you, Moco-chan?

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:11.375
If it was a Japanese plum, that would be fine, but this is not.

00:32:11.395 --> 00:32:12.896
It's a loquat fruit.

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:13.657
A loquat.

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:15.599
A beehive.

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.782
I'm eating it for the first time.

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:18.983
Moco-chan, you're confident.

00:32:20.024 --> 00:32:20.865
I'm a bit nervous.

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.687
Don't spit it out, okay?

00:32:23.027 --> 00:32:24.249
That's rude, okay?

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:25.350
Is there a seed?

00:32:26.174 --> 00:32:29.039
Okay, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:36.891
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Kagoshima who worked hard to make this.

00:32:36.992 --> 00:32:39.496
I didn't buy it anywhere close to Kagoshima.

00:32:39.516 --> 00:32:40.097
Kagoshima?

00:32:40.577 --> 00:32:40.858
Yeah.

00:32:41.138 --> 00:32:42.961
Where's Kagoshima?

00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:43.843
Far away.

00:32:43.863 --> 00:32:45.225
Okay, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:32:45.345 --> 00:32:47.328
It's time to eat it from the tree.

00:32:47.349 --> 00:32:48.891
Itadakimasu!

00:32:48.871 --> 00:32:50.733
Um, not yet.

00:32:50.854 --> 00:32:52.576
I have to figure out which side do I eat this from.

00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:54.058
It's fuzzy all over.

00:32:54.078 --> 00:32:55.599
Just stick it in your mouth, Moco-chan!

00:32:56.821 --> 00:32:58.884
I'm gonna, I'm gonna... It's fuzzy though.

00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:00.686
I'm gonna eat it like a cucumber.

00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:02.749
Why?!

00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:03.850
I'm gonna eat it like a cucumber, Moco-chan.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.552
It's not spiky, it's fuzzy.

00:33:05.572 --> 00:33:07.414
Do you eat the cucumber from the middle?

00:33:07.434 --> 00:33:08.336
I don't know, I'm gonna try that.

00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:09.477
Maybe not, I don't know.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:12.100
Pick somewhere and bite!

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.843
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:13.863 --> 00:33:14.363
Okay.

00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:14.623
Itadakimasu!

00:33:14.644 --> 00:33:16.626
Are you supposed to take the skin off?

00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:16.906
Itadakimasu!

00:33:17.327 --> 00:33:17.427
Okay.

00:33:19.668 --> 00:33:23.493
It smells... It smells?

00:33:23.513 --> 00:33:24.995
It smells... I don't know.

00:33:25.355 --> 00:33:27.738
It smells like a fruit.

00:33:28.078 --> 00:33:28.539
Okay!

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:28.939
Eat it like a kiwi?

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.361
I don't think so.

00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:31.222
I think I just eat it.

00:33:36.429 --> 00:33:38.992
That's one of the same sounds you make when you have natto, huh?

00:33:40.574 --> 00:33:41.755
I don't know what that tastes like.

00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:46.401
Get a bigger bite!

00:33:48.018 --> 00:33:49.660
That was a small bite, Moco-chan.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.742
I think... I hear fleas.

00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:52.502
What?

00:33:53.443 --> 00:33:56.326
I think it tastes like... an apple.

00:33:56.386 --> 00:34:00.250
High-fived a mango.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.392
It's more apple-y than a mango.

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:04.974
Like an apple high-fived a mango.

00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:06.756
Is it seeds?

00:34:07.076 --> 00:34:08.198
Did you find anything?

00:34:11.381 --> 00:34:13.323
There's a big seed, it's like an avocado.

00:34:13.963 --> 00:34:15.865
Avocado?

00:34:17.262 --> 00:34:21.906
That's what it's shiny.

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:23.127
What?

00:34:23.147 --> 00:34:23.247
What?

00:34:23.267 --> 00:34:24.769
What?

00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:26.390
What, Moco-chan?

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:28.012
I'm trying to hold everything.

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:29.353
Why are you spitting things out?

00:34:30.454 --> 00:34:31.335
It's a scene!

00:34:31.355 --> 00:34:31.935
You're putting it on my hand!

00:34:32.075 --> 00:34:33.617
What the heck, Moco-chan?

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.842
It tastes very summery.

00:34:40.043 --> 00:34:41.044
And very refreshing.

00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:45.868
I feel like if you're thirsty, this would be a good replacement.

00:34:47.992 --> 00:34:49.534
I'm gonna eat it, FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:57.687
I don't really like that side of it.

00:34:58.568 --> 00:35:03.395
The inner part around the seed, I don't recommend eating that part.

00:35:03.415 --> 00:35:04.697
One second, can I eat garbage?

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:06.219
Ha!

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:08.303
I'm just gonna take all your garbage from you!

00:35:08.403 --> 00:35:09.564
I'm getting slimy now.

00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:14.231
I'm gonna pull it off.

00:35:14.252 --> 00:35:14.372
There.

00:35:14.392 --> 00:35:15.814
Okay, and I'm not gonna eat the top part.

00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:17.256
Oh, the top part?

00:35:22.771 --> 00:35:25.375
I think it's good.

00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:27.498
Compared to natto.

00:35:27.618 --> 00:35:29.000
I think you could eat it in the morning.

00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:32.325
It'd be good in a smoothie too.

00:35:33.427 --> 00:35:34.929
It's sort of orangey too.

00:35:34.949 --> 00:35:37.854
Sort of vaguely citrusy.

00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:39.696
Perfect FUWAMOCO Morning, huh?

00:35:40.918 --> 00:35:42.060
BAU BAU!

00:35:42.561 --> 00:35:44.343
That was different from natto, huh?

00:35:44.363 --> 00:35:49.010
I think my final review is it's... Apple?

00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:52.255
High five the mango, right?

00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:55.051
55% apple.

00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:58.778
15% orange.

00:35:58.798 --> 00:35:59.379
Rest mango.

00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:01.924
Is that more mango?

00:36:02.425 --> 00:36:03.447
It needs to be more apple.

00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:06.152
Ah, orange.

00:36:06.172 --> 00:36:08.076
Apple, orange, mango, that word, yes!

00:36:08.116 --> 00:36:10.901
Moco-chan, would you like to do more corners like this?

00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:11.863
I'm good.

00:36:12.012 --> 00:36:15.916
Well, let's remember how brave Moco-chan was trying something new today!

00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:21.042
And you know, we'll do our best this week to try things that we might be a little bit scared of too, okay?

00:36:21.242 --> 00:36:21.843
Okay!

00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:25.166
BAU BAU!

00:36:25.187 --> 00:36:25.347
BAU BAU!

00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:35.718
Well... Moco-chan... I have to eat something, then I have to do something else, huh?

00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:41.985
I think you know... I think I said maybe you had...

00:36:42.623 --> 00:36:59.181
BAU BAU!

00:37:02.198 --> 00:37:03.299
Ruffians!

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.942
It's that time again!

00:37:05.982 --> 00:37:11.187
It's time for another well-needed Mococo Pup Talk!

00:37:11.928 --> 00:37:15.211
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:29.906
Ruffians, I don't know about you, but recently we've been feeling like it's been a bit of an emotional time.

00:37:29.926 --> 00:37:31.648
Do you maybe feel like that too?

00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:39.108
Maybe not just one emotion, but a bunch of things.

00:37:40.169 --> 00:37:41.130
Everything, you know?

00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:44.574
And you just, you can't quite explain it.

00:37:46.996 --> 00:37:47.096
Yeah.

00:37:48.437 --> 00:37:49.779
Maybe you've been like this before.

00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:52.942
Maybe not right now, but sometime, you know?

00:37:54.843 --> 00:37:55.984
Maybe you feel a bit sad.

00:37:57.406 --> 00:37:59.388
Confused.

00:37:59.408 --> 00:38:00.449
Maybe a bit upset.

00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:04.032
You just can't really figure it out.

00:38:04.805 --> 00:38:09.489
At times like this when you feel a bit overwhelmed, it's good just to take a deep breath.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.112
Take a bit of time to yourself, you know.

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:13.032
Relax.

00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:14.554
Sort things out.

00:38:16.616 --> 00:38:19.298
You know, go for a walk.

00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:22.361
Have a nice bath.

00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:27.886
Do something that you've been wanting to do and meaning to do but just haven't got to.

00:38:30.088 --> 00:38:33.411
You know, maybe after a bit of time,

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:36.369
You'll be feeling a bit more like your usual self.

00:38:37.891 --> 00:38:39.353
It might take a bit more time.

00:38:40.154 --> 00:38:41.015
Maybe less time.

00:38:43.718 --> 00:38:45.661
Let's just do what we can to support ourselves.

00:38:46.482 --> 00:38:51.008
And if you're able to, support those around you who might be feeling the same too, okay?

00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:54.773
You're amazing and resilient!

00:38:55.614 --> 00:38:57.096
I know you can get through this, okay?

00:38:58.158 --> 00:39:01.923
Feelings are complicated, so just take some deep breaths, okay?

00:39:03.185 --> 00:39:03.465
Got it?

00:39:04.897 --> 00:39:06.219
We believe in you!

00:39:06.861 --> 00:39:08.103
Let's do this together, okay?

00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:08.964
Got it.

00:39:11.128 --> 00:39:12.330
BAU BAU!

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.514
Ganbatte de!

00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:16.799
BAU BAU!

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.083
Thank you, Moco-chan.

00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:21.707
Let's be Ruffians.

00:39:21.727 --> 00:39:24.312
Let's do our best, okay?

00:39:25.394 --> 00:39:27.057
I think there's a lot of...

00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:28.917
Ruff times going on.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:34.697
Cloudy feelings a bit too, but... Let's do our best, okay?

00:39:34.717 --> 00:39:35.680
Let's do it!

00:39:37.415 --> 00:39:38.036
Hello!

00:39:39.998 --> 00:39:43.283
I think it's time we take a look at who's the Doggie of the Day today!

00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:44.364
Yeah!

00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:52.235
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:39:52.255 --> 00:39:52.475
It's Skawo!

00:39:52.495 --> 00:39:52.775
Skawo is cute!

00:39:52.795 --> 00:39:54.197
What a baby!

00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:54.578
Right?

00:39:54.858 --> 00:39:57.702
Look at the very silly, proper ball.

00:39:58.042 --> 00:40:01.427
The ball that ears a little bit.

00:40:01.447 --> 00:40:02.088
I like the tummy.

00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:04.912
The way Skawo is.

00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:06.814
He sleeps like a deer though, huh?

00:40:07.267 --> 00:40:27.148
How'd this go BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:40:30.082 --> 00:40:32.548
That's the zoomies.

00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:37.480
That's the zoomies.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:44.035
But I feel like there needs to be a bit more of like the... You know the zoomies, but you know.

00:40:44.176 --> 00:40:46.842
What a skilled person right by you.

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:57.409
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:40:57.429 --> 00:41:01.657
Have a howl of a day!

00:41:01.937 --> 00:41:03.801
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:11.074
Have a howl of a day!

00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:20.346
Rufus.

00:41:25.072 --> 00:41:26.354
Rufus.

00:41:26.955 --> 00:41:27.335
BAU BAU!

00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:27.896
BAU BAU!

00:41:27.976 --> 00:41:29.939
Give this CD lotsa battle key!

00:41:31.261 --> 00:41:32.382
BAU BAU!

00:41:32.462 --> 00:41:33.784
BAU BAU!

00:41:35.006 --> 00:41:37.709
And next we have our corner.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.492
Today I went on a walk.

00:41:39.752 --> 00:41:42.376
We have De-den!

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:46.261
Today I went on a walk around an aquarium.

00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:46.742
Jellyfish!

00:41:47.102 --> 00:41:48.604
Oh my gosh.

00:41:48.972 --> 00:41:53.643
We look like we fit just in there together with the jellyfish, huh?

00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:59.335
To be honest, when I see these jellyfish, I can tell they're real.

00:42:00.358 --> 00:42:04.888
And then I think of all the jellyfish and I can tell both are fake.

00:42:05.847 --> 00:42:09.493
They're so cute though, you know!

00:42:10.054 --> 00:42:14.802
Thank you for taking us on an aquarium date together with you!

00:42:14.822 --> 00:42:18.187
I think my favorite part of the aquarium is the jellyfish.

00:42:18.207 --> 00:42:19.309
Yeah, you know.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.452
They're like jellyfish.

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.855
The manta rays are very cute, right?

00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:23.436
Yeah, I know.

00:42:23.496 --> 00:42:24.758
They have the faces.

00:42:25.179 --> 00:42:26.100
I like watching the jellyfish.

00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:29.142
Sea slugs are kinda cool too.

00:42:29.622 --> 00:42:30.023
Yeah!

00:42:30.043 --> 00:42:33.447
Cuddlefish too.

00:42:33.708 --> 00:42:35.090
You know, I think they're all pretty cool.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.353
There's a lot of cool sea creatures too.

00:42:38.374 --> 00:42:38.474
Yeah.

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.819
There's a Ruffian asked whether it's real.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.721
I think it's real at an aquarium.

00:42:43.741 --> 00:42:44.903
I don't think you need to ask.

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:45.844
Yeah.

00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:46.385
Unless it's penguins.

00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:49.469
Are those penguins fake?

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:51.371
Yeah, I don't think you need to worry.

00:42:51.391 --> 00:42:52.453
No.

00:42:52.573 --> 00:42:55.817
That would be a big deal though if all the aquarium animals were fake.

00:42:56.388 --> 00:42:57.753
That could be cool in it's own way though.

00:42:58.797 --> 00:43:03.314
It's like a wax museum but for aquariums.

00:43:04.097 --> 00:43:05.101
People would go!

00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:07.731
Idea I guess!

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:12.623
BAU BAU!

00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:13.824
Thank you!

00:43:13.844 --> 00:43:16.927
Thank you for always sharing your walks with us, Mofus!

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.990
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:23.694
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:43:23.974 --> 00:43:27.658
You mentioned that oppai ice cream is pretty rare.

00:43:28.018 --> 00:43:30.040
So where did you manage to find it during your trip?

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:33.223
Was it a dagashi shop?

00:43:33.964 --> 00:43:34.765
BAU BAU!

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:37.710
Ruffians are maybe very confused at this moment.

00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:39.273
That makes sense.

00:43:40.214 --> 00:43:43.921
We had a very rare old school ice cream.

00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:47.146
It's loved by kids but it's called Oppai Ice Cream.

00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.851
There's different names too for it.

00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:54.498
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:43:54.518 --> 00:43:58.784
Have a howl of a day!

00:43:58.804 --> 00:44:04.693
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:44:07.558 --> 00:44:13.847
Have a howl of a day!

00:44:13.827 --> 00:44:20.894
Yeah, and you know when we went on our little trip around Japan recently, we found it!

00:44:20.914 --> 00:44:21.055
Yeah!

00:44:21.155 --> 00:44:25.799
And we bought it so that our demon dog friend, so she could try it out.

00:44:25.819 --> 00:44:28.282
Yeah, Japanese culture, you know!

00:44:28.442 --> 00:44:33.307
And you know, in the past, you find these kind of ice creams at the dagashi and the dagashi shops.

00:44:33.327 --> 00:44:35.690
It's like a candy store, a toy store.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:36.771
Yeah, for kids, you know.

00:44:36.791 --> 00:44:38.873
Usually very inexpensive, only a few yen.

00:44:38.853 --> 00:44:45.121
Yeah, but, you know, now that last year they're rare themselves and this ice cream's even more rare!

00:44:45.622 --> 00:44:50.669
But this time, we found it at a very large supermarket in the middle of nowhere.

00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:54.294
Yeah, and they had almost every type of ice cream there.

00:44:54.314 --> 00:44:55.956
I was really impressed.

00:44:55.976 --> 00:44:58.579
Like it was ice cream and ice cream and ice cream and ice cream.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.421
But, uh, yeah.

00:45:00.702 --> 00:45:01.143
It's really rare.

00:45:01.563 --> 00:45:05.088
That's why we bought it despite not having a freezer.

00:45:05.108 --> 00:45:05.709
A freezer.

00:45:05.889 --> 00:45:07.932
And there is five in the pack.

00:45:07.912 --> 00:45:09.634
Yeah, you have to buy a lot of them.

00:45:10.135 --> 00:45:11.436
Because that's how it was sold.

00:45:11.456 --> 00:45:13.999
Did any of us really want to have ice cream at that moment?

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.442
Japanese culture, Moco-chan!

00:45:16.462 --> 00:45:17.564
No, but it was a chance.

00:45:19.065 --> 00:45:20.387
Yeah, and... Chance!

00:45:20.407 --> 00:45:21.348
You take the chance!

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:23.891
In the end, it exploded everywhere.

00:45:26.735 --> 00:45:27.395
hololive.

00:45:28.317 --> 00:45:29.438
And the room.

00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:31.761
And the room.

00:45:31.781 --> 00:45:31.881
Cups.

00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:32.562
Every direction.

00:45:32.582 --> 00:45:33.363
Controllers.

00:45:33.603 --> 00:45:35.005
Not Moco-chan.

00:45:35.025 --> 00:45:36.346
Books.

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:37.427
Yeah.

00:45:37.448 --> 00:45:37.868
Carpet.

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:43.870
Sometimes it happens, I don't know about that.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.092
It was worth it though!

00:45:45.633 --> 00:45:46.995
BAU BAU!

00:45:47.015 --> 00:45:47.957
Thank you!

00:45:47.977 --> 00:45:55.269
Thank you so much Ruffians for all your submissions for being a part, a very special part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:45:55.749 --> 00:45:56.531
Remember!

00:45:56.911 --> 00:46:00.878
Use the hashtag to send us your Doggie of the Day!

00:46:00.898 --> 00:46:01.919

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:02.320
FWMCMORNING!

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.584
And you know your Pero Sightings.

00:46:04.604 --> 00:46:09.353
It's important to know where Pero is, especially maybe for the Ruffians who want to come across Pero.

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:12.339
Also your questions, you know, the walks you're going on.

00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:14.583
Please let us know, okay?

00:46:15.144 --> 00:46:17.108
BAU BAU!

00:46:17.128 --> 00:46:18.351
Thank you!

00:46:18.371 --> 00:46:21.777
And we have another stream coming up soon!

00:46:22.448 --> 00:46:24.631
De-den!

00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:26.034
Wow!

00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:27.055
At 3am!

00:46:27.396 --> 00:46:28.778
3am PT!

00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:32.945
It's a little bit early in the morning, but we can't help it, that's the business hours.

00:46:32.965 --> 00:46:34.207
FUWAMOCO Cafe!

00:46:34.227 --> 00:46:37.873
FUWAMOCO is opening up again for business!

00:46:37.893 --> 00:46:38.714
Our main cafe!

00:46:38.734 --> 00:46:42.941
I know, and this time we don't know what kind of hololive members will come to patronize our store.

00:46:43.121 --> 00:46:44.303
We don't know.

00:46:44.323 --> 00:46:45.705
Yeah, but...

00:46:45.685 --> 00:46:50.353
We just have to hope that maybe we can survive in this economy, huh?

00:46:50.373 --> 00:46:50.754
I guess.

00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:51.696
Visit us.

00:46:51.716 --> 00:46:55.823
There's a lot of competition when it comes to make out face.

00:46:56.204 --> 00:46:58.267
Well, we'll just go out of business.

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:00.551
No set up shop.

00:47:01.092 --> 00:47:02.535
Go on the next week.

00:47:02.555 --> 00:47:03.897
We'll do our best.

00:47:03.877 --> 00:47:24.197
BAU BAU!

00:47:24.177 --> 00:47:28.162
A very special Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:47:28.222 --> 00:47:31.326
It's gonna be on Thursday at 6pm P.T.

00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:34.710
And we have a special announcement with that too!

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.871
Yeah, don't miss it!

00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:36.913
We hope that you'll be there.

00:47:36.933 --> 00:47:40.297
We'll be singing a bunch of anime songs, Japanese pop songs.

00:47:40.337 --> 00:47:40.858
We don't know.

00:47:40.898 --> 00:47:41.498
You don't know.

00:47:41.538 --> 00:47:42.239
We'll find out.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:43.941
We don't know.

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:45.223
You don't know.

00:47:45.203 --> 00:47:46.805
We'll find out all together.

00:47:46.825 --> 00:47:51.130
And then after that we're going to be having even more silly fun together with Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.194
We're playing it on our Smash Summerture Gaming.

00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:56.457
And you know we both get to play.

00:47:56.477 --> 00:47:56.577
Yeah.

00:47:57.378 --> 00:48:00.242
Which is good because I'm pretty good at it.

00:48:00.262 --> 00:48:00.702
K.O.

00:48:00.722 --> 00:48:00.982
K.O.

00:48:01.183 --> 00:48:02.324
Moco-chan doesn't say anything.

00:48:03.025 --> 00:48:03.105
K.O.

00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:03.846
BAU BAU!

00:48:04.186 --> 00:48:11.115
And then later this week we have more FUWAMOCO Morning followed by a random FUWAMOCO Horror Game Matsuri.

00:48:11.135 --> 00:48:13.658
We're going to be playing a bunch of different horror games.

00:48:13.638 --> 00:48:15.007
I'm not too sure what's gonna happen.

00:48:15.027 --> 00:48:16.094
There's a bunch of them.

00:48:16.255 --> 00:48:17.161
A variety.

00:48:17.725 --> 00:48:18.973
They're all gonna be really...

00:48:20.017 --> 00:48:24.924
And then later this week we also have ENRECORD!

00:48:28.008 --> 00:48:34.817
hololive English ENigmatic Recollection.

00:48:34.897 --> 00:48:44.130
Chapter 2 starts later this week so we hope that you'll join us in all of hololive English for that as well!

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.592
And we have Metal Gear Solid 3 again later this week!

00:48:45.612 --> 00:48:48.015
I can confirm that the PS2 is now off.

00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:51.696
It is off and it will be on when it's time to play Metal Gear Solid 3.

00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:54.310
Yes, pray for the PS2.

00:48:54.897 --> 00:49:14.094
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:49:14.134 --> 00:49:24.904
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

00:49:24.884 --> 00:49:47.432
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:49:47.412 --> 00:49:57.351
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:10.956
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>
