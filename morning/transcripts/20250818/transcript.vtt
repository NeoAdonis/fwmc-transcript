00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:18.917
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.950
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:36.410
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.692
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:45.902
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:46.083
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:51.810
Pero on the brain is speaking a little bit fluffier than normal.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:01.790
Today, Ruffians, we are your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:12.321
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us for our 169th episode today!

00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:12.701
BAU BAU!

00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.204
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:16.205
Thank you!

00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:18.287
Ruffians, you look...

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:26.013
Maybe you should stay tuned then.

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:27.315
FUWAMOCO Peros?

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:31.261
No, we're not Peros!

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.026
We're FUWAMOCO!

00:06:35.848 --> 00:06:37.491
I think it's...

00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:43.379
If there's somebody else that it suits even better but... First, Ruffians!

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:53.673
For Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:53.693 --> 00:06:54.233
A.K.A.

00:06:54.254 --> 00:06:54.714
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:57.979
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.406
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays once a week.

00:07:03.426 --> 00:07:06.550
So that, you know, you can get more

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:10.385
Good job!

00:07:10.405 --> 00:07:17.634

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:29.089
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:29.109 --> 00:07:29.449
BAU BAU!

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.007
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:38.027 --> 00:07:41.191
Thank you for waking up and joining us today, Ruffians!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.072
We're so happy!

00:07:42.673 --> 00:07:50.243
Another big week's about to start and we're happy to start it off together with you!

00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:50.444
FUWAMOCO!

00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:54.209
Wow, there's a bunch of exciting things to talk about!

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.732
Moco-chan, a lot of news going on in hololive!

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:59.436
Let's check it all out!

00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:02.530
Huh?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.873
Moco-chan, Moco-chan, why are you getting all quiet again?

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.537
Huh?

00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:10.982
Pero?

00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:13.525
Pero Sighting?

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:18.873
Ruffians, just because we're wearing the Pero cap... No!

00:08:18.893 --> 00:08:22.458
Doesn't make it a Pero Sighting, you know?

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:23.099
No!

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.382
No... Yeah, it's just a hat, Ruffians!

00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:26.724
It's just a hat!

00:08:26.744 --> 00:08:27.304
It's just a hat!

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:28.186
Don't be silly!

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:31.330
Huh?

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:32.105
Three?

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:33.706
Three perros today, huh?

00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:34.908
Are you seeing something?

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:37.711
Huh?

00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:37.811
Huh?

00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:38.072
No.

00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:46.041
I'm not Pero!

00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:46.282
I'm Fuwawa!

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:46.582
I'm not Pero!

00:08:46.602 --> 00:08:47.303
I'm Mococo!

00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:49.285
Ruffians, you understand this, right?

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:49.726
Right.

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.128
Basic common sense.

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:52.389
Use it!

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.473
FUWAMOCO-chan, why would you say that?

00:08:56.094 --> 00:08:58.777
Well... Huh?

00:08:58.797 --> 00:09:01.300
We don't have a Pero sighting, but...

00:09:01.955 --> 00:09:05.260
There's something that happened, Ruffians.

00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:10.168
Maybe we should talk about it.

00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:19.062
Ruffians!

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:23.068
What happened here?

00:09:23.943 --> 00:09:27.407
He took over a channel on his birthday.

00:09:27.427 --> 00:09:28.048
I can't believe it.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:35.736
Ruffians, why didn't you let us know right when it happened, huh?

00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:39.240
Use the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning when it's going on.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.461
Why is Pero here, huh?

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:41.022
Do you see this?

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.364
Do you see what's on the screen here?

00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:46.688
Something very nasty happened.

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:48.550
Very, very nasty.

00:09:52.664 --> 00:09:59.359
In case you don't have the understanding of what this here on the left is.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.243
That's okay, I don't mind.

00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:02.386
Wow!

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:04.049
Pero.

00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:08.800
He made a list of the whole EN members!

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:12.700
Not who he wants to kiss from the most.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.681
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:13.801
Wait.

00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:15.604
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:18.888
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:20.070
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.750
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.431
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.112
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:22.853
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:23.534
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:24.215
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:25.036
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:26.298 --> 00:10:27.018
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:28.160
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.881
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:29.742
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.224
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:31.244 --> 00:10:32.005
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:32.766
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:33.807
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:34.488
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:35.389
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:35.409 --> 00:10:36.130
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.111
Not who he wants to be kissed by.

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:37.572
Not who he wants to

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.662
This doesn't matter!

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.103
It does matter!

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:42.665
Excuse me, it does matter!

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.509
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.171
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:49.094
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:50.956
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:51.577
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:51.657 --> 00:10:53.600
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.042
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:56.163
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:10:59.087
I didn't pay attention.

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:03.064
Why am I the only one in F tier huh?

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:08.714
I mean I guess it's okay but you know it's never happy to be in a tier ranking and be in F tier.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.317
Especially on your own.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.983
Why is no one not with me?

00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:14.705
It's okay.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.932
I wish I was in F tier there with you Moco-chan right by your side.

00:11:18.952 --> 00:11:21.777
Does that make you feel better?

00:11:21.817 --> 00:11:23.320
Yeah.

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:29.333
Ruffians, this is disgusting!

00:11:29.994 --> 00:11:31.136
Nasty!

00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:32.619
Filthy!

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:36.566
Fuwawa should be an S!

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.557
I don't want to be an S!

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:43.278
I don't want to be an S!

00:11:43.298 --> 00:11:48.227
I don't want to be an S!

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.918
F is for fuzzy, it's also for fluffy, no!

00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:56.144
I don't wanna think about this.

00:11:56.906 --> 00:12:00.857
No, you know, Ruffians, you've seen Pero's tongue before, right?

00:12:03.002 --> 00:12:04.266
Yeah.

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:04.907
Yeah.

00:12:04.927 --> 00:12:05.850
Right.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.351
Right.

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:07.700
Nightmare fuel.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.682
Right.

00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:14.487
We understand, you know, it was his birthday.

00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:15.968
Not acceptable.

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:18.030
Please don't let him get away with these things, okay?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.971
Not acceptable.

00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:20.353
Yeah.

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:26.299
I think this just means, Moco-chan, you know, every August 8th from now on we have to watch out.

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:26.719
August 8th?

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:29.021
Is it August 8th?

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:29.582
I can't remember.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.083
I didn't think it was 9th.

00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:32.245
So being remembered.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.588
What day was it?

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:36.249
8th?

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.709
9th?

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:40.316
Ruffians, you remember, okay?

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:41.577
You remember!

00:12:41.737 --> 00:12:43.980
Ruffians, I couldn't remember either or.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.321
Maybe both days.

00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:48.444
BAU BAU!

00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:50.226
Watch out for him, okay?

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:52.548
Please remember the important things, Ruffians.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.392
Extra, extra safety.

00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:56.912
Got it?

00:12:58.034 --> 00:12:59.755
He can't keep getting away with it!

00:12:59.775 --> 00:13:03.999
I have to stop him.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.620
BAU BAU!

00:13:05.157 --> 00:13:06.699
Moco-chan!

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:13.488
Let's put that aside.

00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:21.699
All the awful feelings aside.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.721
Forgotten.

00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:28.308
There were so many exciting things that happened throughout the month of August this month.

00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:29.630
So fun!

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.375
And one big one was...

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.258
Justice!

00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:37.739
They had their 3D debuts!

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.904
Starting with Elizabeth, and then we had Gigi!

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.987
And then Cecilia and Raora!

00:13:45.007 --> 00:13:49.992
And then most recently they had their 3D collab All of Justice all together!

00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:53.595
And we watched it together with all of Abyss!

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:54.877
It was something else!

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.300
You know, we got to see a lot of

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.054
Justice and, uh, why maybe?

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:03.727
We are still completely fine.

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:05.134
We are.

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:05.867
Good.

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:07.428
No worries.

00:14:07.968 --> 00:14:08.189
No.

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:10.751
Justice does not stand a chance.

00:14:12.072 --> 00:14:12.513
Yeah.

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.615
It's not like we were worried or anything.

00:14:15.015 --> 00:14:21.000
It really solidified, you know, the fact that I am not concerned in the slightest.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.503
I saw a lot of their skills, you know.

00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:25.524
I had one question.

00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:26.265
What?

00:14:26.305 --> 00:14:27.406
And I was a bit confused.

00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:29.588
Just this.

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:31.830
Just like that.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.872
Just this.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:48.165
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:58.861
Justice.

00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:01.085
Just like that.

00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:03.188
Justice.

00:15:03.228 --> 00:15:13.005
Get that target.

00:15:13.576 --> 00:15:15.037
What are you both saying?

00:15:15.398 --> 00:15:17.500
We saw, did you see that one?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.902
You know they had to type on a keyboard.

00:15:20.303 --> 00:15:24.567
And that one I was like, oh I'm not gonna answer the super easy trivia questions.

00:15:24.627 --> 00:15:27.150
I'm just gonna skip-a skip-a skip-a.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.851
Yeah, just skip-a skip-a.

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.513
That's why we're here, you know.

00:15:30.873 --> 00:15:35.558
Couldn't do easy things like just knock targets off of each other with a bat.

00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:38.321
They couldn't even spin around in a circle properly.

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.363
What are they doing?

00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:42.004
We can teach them how to spin.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:42.705
Although...

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:43.786
Cecilia's good.

00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:46.509
Very good at spinning to win.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.171
Yeah, but she still loses.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:50.334
Yeah, she lost.

00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:51.115
Training time!

00:15:51.175 --> 00:15:54.118
Yeah, I think, you know, we're feeling extra comfy.

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:56.941
Extra comfy.

00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.824
But, you don't know!

00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:01.887
Justice has made their 3D debuts.

00:16:01.907 --> 00:16:06.573
They have a bunch of exciting merch and everything to commemorate the moment.

00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:10.397
But amongst that, they have their 3D acrylic staff!

00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:14.484
We really like the 3D acrylic stands because they are big!

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:16.727
See the FUWAMOCO too!

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:18.470
These are extra special!

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:23.799
Because you know, it sort of means that now you are a full-fledged hololive member.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:32.894
You've been here, you've made your 3D debut, and now you know all the possibilities are there waiting for you, you know?

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:34.937
They're big!

00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:35.338
They are big!

00:16:35.318 --> 00:16:43.388
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:16:44.093 --> 00:17:09.325
FUWAMOCO Congratulations Justice on your DD debuts!

00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:10.848
Ruffians!

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:16.039
From FUWAMOCO, we have some very exciting news to share!

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:22.252
Recently, you know FUWAMOCO, we're kind of a little bit more in the magazines over the last few months.

00:17:22.272 --> 00:17:22.352
But!

00:17:22.913 --> 00:17:28.565
We're in one really big magazine, the FUWAMOCO!

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:29.747
We're in Comptique!

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:29.968
Comptique!

00:17:29.988 --> 00:17:30.148
BAU BAU!

00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:55.613
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:55.593 --> 00:18:06.902
FUWAMOCO

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:12.855
At one point we were calling it the 1,000 questions.

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:13.636
It felt like 1,000 questions!

00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:17.161
I don't think I've ever answered this many questions at once.

00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:24.131
And there's a really really heartwarming retrospective recap on our two years in hololive so far too.

00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:26.314
And we have a really cute manga.

00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:27.996
The manga too!

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:30.020
So cute!

00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:34.389
And you know we also had an interview together with Patra Onee-chan.

00:18:34.409 --> 00:18:41.063
You know we talked about Akihama, moe culture, nighttime showtime, a bunch of different things.

00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:45.894
And there's also a little bit of some quality photos of FUWAMOCO too.

00:18:45.974 --> 00:18:47.537
They're pretty cute.

00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:50.801
Alright, Moco-chan.

00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:51.542
So please check them out.

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:56.407
There's also, you know every magazine in Japan kinda likes to have bonuses.

00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:58.649
What's a magazine without a bonus?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.113
And this time there's a special bonus card.

00:19:02.213 --> 00:19:05.377
A dress-up stand.

00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:07.499
We have three outfits.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.723
And a Pero might be included too.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:22.977
By the way, also Paternone-chan, she had a special interview with Aqua Plus, one of our favorite game companies!

00:19:22.997 --> 00:19:24.980
They make chihuahua and utawarerumono, and we love them!

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.963
And I'm definitely not envious on this one.

00:19:28.404 --> 00:19:29.445
Definitely not.

00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:31.728
Come on, Moco-chan, we're so close.

00:19:31.748 --> 00:19:34.091
I wouldn't have been able to talk to them.

00:19:35.513 --> 00:19:38.176
No, I wouldn't go anywhere.

00:19:39.197 --> 00:19:39.718
I'd be like, I'm so happy!

00:19:39.738 --> 00:19:40.018
It's an honor!

00:19:40.038 --> 00:19:40.319
It's an honor!

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:40.619
It's an honor!

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:40.759
Hi!

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:41.520
It's an honor!

00:19:41.872 --> 00:19:45.236
But we hope, Ruffians, we hope you can get your paws on it.

00:19:45.957 --> 00:19:52.344
We have heard that trying to order online seems like it's been so kind of popular.

00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:54.887
So it's a little bit hard to get online.

00:19:54.947 --> 00:19:58.231
So we hope, Ruffians, if you want to get your paws on it, please check it out.

00:19:58.491 --> 00:19:59.572
I think there's also digital versions.

00:19:59.592 --> 00:20:02.015
Maybe there will be more released online.

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:05.960
If you happen to be in Japan, there's a digital version.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.360
No shipping!

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:27.167
BAU BAU!

00:20:27.147 --> 00:20:43.384

00:20:43.364 --> 00:20:45.027

00:20:45.087 --> 00:20:46.950
But you know what?

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.736
We have a third concert, all for one, coming up later this week.

00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:56.385
But something's very, very happy!

00:20:56.405 --> 00:20:58.248
It's been announced!

00:20:58.268 --> 00:21:05.540
Just the other day, hololive Indonesia, it was announced that they're having their very first in-person concert!

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:05.760
BAU BAU!

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.007
Congratulations!

00:21:10.027 --> 00:21:11.630
So exciting!

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:17.199
It's gonna be happening at Comic Frontier 21 on November 15th and 16th!

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:18.822
Really soon!

00:21:19.643 --> 00:21:19.783
Right!

00:21:19.803 --> 00:21:26.214
But this concert is celebrating Whole ID's 5th anniversary and it's titled Chromatic Future.

00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:30.381
Look at them here all so cool and sparkling!

00:21:30.361 --> 00:21:34.366
I'm so excited!

00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:34.686
It's huge!

00:21:34.706 --> 00:21:35.927
It's huge!

00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:36.068
Right!

00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:36.788
We're so, so happy!

00:21:36.808 --> 00:21:36.909
Yeah!

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:39.091
Really happy for all our ID's and fans!

00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:39.472
Yeah!

00:21:39.492 --> 00:21:46.500
We were really, really hoping, you know, maybe we'll... Oh, maybe we'll end up with a million!

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.101
Oh, right!

00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:48.542
Maybe!

00:21:48.622 --> 00:21:49.443
Maybe!

00:21:49.463 --> 00:21:50.084
Oh, we're really, really happy.

00:21:50.104 --> 00:21:51.305
Right, we were watching Karaoke on Cloud 2!

00:21:51.325 --> 00:21:56.992
So... And you know, being able to see all the ID fans and reactions on Twitter and Twitch.

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:57.212
Yeah!

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.055
We really can't wait.

00:21:59.075 --> 00:21:59.976
We're so excited.

00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:02.179
I wonder what songs they're gonna be performing.

00:22:02.199 --> 00:22:06.766
I'm so excited.

00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:14.177
We'll have to look forward to it, but a big hug as the whole ID!

00:22:14.197 --> 00:22:14.357
BAU BAU!

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:57.540
BAU BAU!

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:05.403
Maybe there's not so much hololive English news or hololive JP news or hololive ID news.

00:23:05.423 --> 00:23:07.507
FUWAMOCO news, um, Moco-chan.

00:23:07.948 --> 00:23:12.175
You wanted to share something that has been fun recently.

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:15.280
We talked about it a bit here and there and on Twitter.

00:23:16.222 --> 00:23:21.250
And Ruffians, the next picture that's gonna be shared might have this.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.958
Does have bugs.

00:23:23.978 --> 00:23:28.391
If you don't like photos of bugs, maybe look away.

00:23:28.472 --> 00:23:33.687
If you feel like your morning breakfast is not going to be as delicious as it is normally.

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:35.193
Okay!

00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:43.347
Because recently... De-den!

00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:43.628
It's open!

00:23:43.648 --> 00:23:45.912
We took them home!

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.655
This is Cho-cho!

00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:49.398
Cho-cho that we talked about previously!

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.962
Look at Cho-cho's so amazing body!

00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:56.350
This is not the pervert Takeda!

00:23:57.022 --> 00:23:59.287
Hi!

00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:00.871
See, and look, we got a new- Are they alive?

00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:01.573
No, they're dead.

00:24:01.853 --> 00:24:03.377
See, and this cicada's different.

00:24:03.397 --> 00:24:06.665
This is not Drainage Senpai's friend that we're gonna give her.

00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:07.607
No, no.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.612
This is a new one for FUWAMOCO.

00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:09.732
Yeah.

00:24:09.893 --> 00:24:13.461
And that's Chocho that we picked up- We found.

00:24:13.441 --> 00:24:21.912
Outside the studio and then we thought maybe we could revive it and then we couldn't and then it was still dead by the time we left so we took it home.

00:24:21.932 --> 00:24:22.032
Yeah.

00:24:23.014 --> 00:24:23.174
Yeah.

00:24:23.194 --> 00:24:25.136
Isn't Chocho beautiful?

00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:25.257
Yeah!

00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:27.419
Chocho was really big when it still could've half-alived.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.661
Yeah.

00:24:29.122 --> 00:24:31.004
And this is a new cicada!

00:24:31.024 --> 00:24:31.124
Yeah!

00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:34.449
We've been having, you know, cicadas, they only last for so long.

00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:35.750
Yeah, they come out of the ground.

00:24:35.771 --> 00:24:40.697
They shed their skin so you can pick up the shells and that's fun but you don't really see the dead cicadas that often.

00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:49.503
But the story behind him is that one morning, we got up early and we're like, Nerissa, let's go have breakfast!

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.187
So we went to have breakfast.

00:24:51.207 --> 00:24:52.209
It was delicious breakfast.

00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:53.573
It was really, really rainy.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:54.535
Yeah.

00:24:54.953 --> 00:25:01.441
And then, when we went out of the restaurant, then Nerissa spotted a Cicada and she goes, FUWAMOCO!

00:25:02.102 --> 00:25:05.766
It wasn't here when we went in, so then it's probably just recently died.

00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:06.868
Why don't you bring it home?

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.775
So, you know, I took something special back from the restaurant with us.

00:25:12.855 --> 00:25:13.496
Doggy bag.

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:17.461
And now we have our own cicada.

00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:20.364
You know, the friend that we have for Ririni-senpai.

00:25:20.945 --> 00:25:22.767
Oh, that's just the shell.

00:25:22.747 --> 00:25:24.529
No, Moco-chan, that's the cicada.

00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:27.312
It's just missing half of the body.

00:25:27.332 --> 00:25:28.854
For Reine-senpai.

00:25:28.874 --> 00:25:30.396
No, no, no, for Rui-ne-senpai.

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.878
You kept on saying Reine-senpai.

00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:33.780
No, Rui-ne-senpai.

00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:35.161
Ruffians!

00:25:36.823 --> 00:25:43.651
But Reine-senpai also did get a special shell in the can.

00:25:43.992 --> 00:25:47.456
See, we found a cicada that just happened to be shedding its shell.

00:25:47.476 --> 00:25:48.797
Yes, I think we talked about it.

00:25:48.817 --> 00:25:49.598
We did talk a little bit.

00:25:49.578 --> 00:26:13.071
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:13.793 --> 00:26:27.465
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:28.762 --> 00:26:31.646
Yeah, we learned from the JP Ruffians!

00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:35.452
You know when you think there's a dead cicada, you go, oh there's a dead cicada!

00:26:35.472 --> 00:26:39.378
You maybe go and try and touch it or pick it up, and then it's like, NO I'M ALIVE!

00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:41.662
You call that semi-final.

00:26:41.742 --> 00:26:45.047
You know, cause in Japanese a cicada's called semi.

00:26:45.768 --> 00:26:51.737
And then, it's kind of a pun because you think it's over, like it's done, but no, it's just semi-final.

00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:53.339
Yeah.

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:55.022
Yeah.

00:26:55.492 --> 00:27:00.159
I'm happy though!

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:01.661
Why do bugs go like my legs?

00:27:03.463 --> 00:27:06.668
FUWAMOCO-chan's only bothered with bugs on your legs, huh?

00:27:06.688 --> 00:27:06.788
Yeah.

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.672
I haven't had any other issues with bugs.

00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:10.193
No.

00:27:10.673 --> 00:27:10.914
No.

00:27:11.675 --> 00:27:12.035
No.

00:27:12.055 --> 00:27:14.599
Do you want to know where this Akira is sitting?

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.281
And where Chocho is sitting?

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:22.630
Chocho is actually sitting right beside our 3D acrylic stands!

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:28.985
He got dropped because the air conditioning blew him over so he lost his antenna.

00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:33.851
And then the cicada is sitting on our kitchen counter.

00:27:35.433 --> 00:27:41.440
At first he was in our, what's it, our bath area.

00:27:41.481 --> 00:27:43.082
And we put the drying cycle on.

00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:44.845
But now I think he's dry.

00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:49.150
Next to your foot!

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.553
Not next to the food, but kind of in the...

00:27:52.023 --> 00:27:53.926
He's on the opposite side of the microwave.

00:27:53.946 --> 00:27:55.148
He's not near the microwave.

00:27:55.488 --> 00:27:56.850
But he's more closer to the sink.

00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:01.558
That is the food!

00:28:01.578 --> 00:28:03.040
No, he's a pretty crispy thing.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.283
He just did a good job at drying it, I think.

00:28:05.323 --> 00:28:10.351
Don't eat the chopsticks!

00:28:10.371 --> 00:28:10.892
I'll do my best!

00:28:10.872 --> 00:28:16.018
But hopefully we can get some more cicadas before the summer ends.

00:28:16.238 --> 00:28:17.560
Gotta keep your eyes open.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.224
I always turn on my phone light being like... Cicada?

00:28:21.244 --> 00:28:23.667
Is that a leaf on the ground or is that a cicada?

00:28:23.687 --> 00:28:24.728
I think that's a cicada.

00:28:24.748 --> 00:28:26.590
It sort of looks like a little cicada.

00:28:28.553 --> 00:28:30.495
How many do you want?

00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:32.317
As many as we can.

00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:33.098
Why not more?

00:28:33.458 --> 00:28:35.040
Yeah.

00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:42.040
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:53.772
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:28:56.274 --> 00:29:06.124
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:12.255
Not hate them, we eat them.

00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:14.159
I don't hate them though.

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:16.243
But they're friendly, but I don't like them.

00:29:16.263 --> 00:29:16.524
No.

00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:18.087
Yeah.

00:29:18.107 --> 00:29:18.949
Eat them.

00:29:19.283 --> 00:29:23.330
BAU BAU!

00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:26.675
You know, Ruffians are all complimenting her.

00:29:26.695 --> 00:29:27.857
I can't stop smiling.

00:29:27.957 --> 00:29:29.600
This is a good place to talk about this, yes.

00:29:31.323 --> 00:29:35.530
As you know, Ruffians, I mentioned that there's somebody that looks even better at this.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.254
Do you know who that is?

00:29:39.382 --> 00:29:42.650
That's you, Ruffians!

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.775
Because we have... De-den!

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:45.958
Right now!

00:29:45.978 --> 00:29:51.111
Ice Ticket Anniversary Celebration which is on sale!

00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.572
BAU BAU BAU!

00:29:51.592 --> 00:29:55.281
And you can get your own very... Your own very own...

00:29:55.683 --> 00:30:15.413
Pero on the Brain Camp!

00:30:15.393 --> 00:30:16.796
What is wrong with it all?

00:30:16.816 --> 00:30:18.339
It was not sweaty.

00:30:19.842 --> 00:30:20.524
Not stuffy.

00:30:20.704 --> 00:30:20.804
Yeah.

00:30:20.824 --> 00:30:22.608
Pero's always on your brain.

00:30:22.648 --> 00:30:24.592
I can have Pero even more on the brain.

00:30:24.612 --> 00:30:25.935
Now you can show your feelings.

00:30:27.418 --> 00:30:27.578
Alright.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.991
And also, you know, in the set, we have the FUWAMOCO Ita shirt!

00:30:34.011 --> 00:30:36.777
It's a very cute FUWAMOCO shirt, you know.

00:30:36.757 --> 00:30:39.182
What a lesson I've been to, buddies!

00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:42.468
You don't really see merch like this that often.

00:30:42.488 --> 00:30:44.833
This time, it's a very cool design.

00:30:44.853 --> 00:30:48.179
Maybe not as fluffy and fuzzy as usual.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.373
But I think it'll be very well paired together with the Happy Puppy Happy tune.

00:30:55.353 --> 00:31:03.266
We'd love it if you wanted to wear it!

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:04.247
We also have the FUWAMOCO Donut Cushion!

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:08.434
One side is Fuwawa and one side is Mococo!

00:31:08.454 --> 00:31:10.718
It's in the shape of a pondering.

00:31:10.898 --> 00:31:12.881
It's rather big.

00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:17.188
Rather big, you know, maybe you could use it as a pillow or just a nice big sofa cushion.

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.572
A decent sized sofa cushion, kind of.

00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:21.415
Yes, very cute.

00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:23.880
You can put it in your desk chair.

00:31:24.221 --> 00:31:26.184
You know, very comfy to sit on too.

00:31:26.224 --> 00:31:31.574
But if you want to, there are Ruffians so you can see Fuwawa and Moco-chan at the same time.

00:31:31.854 --> 00:31:33.918
If you have a big sofa, I guess that will work.

00:31:33.938 --> 00:31:35.481
You might want to get two.

00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:38.867
And we also have a voice pack.

00:31:38.887 --> 00:31:41.492
We're missing one, Moco-chan.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:47.797
We also have a very special situational voice pack in English and Japanese.

00:31:47.817 --> 00:31:52.143
Cat Cafe D with FUWAMOCO!

00:31:52.163 --> 00:31:52.483
It's very cute.

00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:55.568
And this one is also digitally available.

00:31:55.628 --> 00:31:57.150
It is digitally available.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.294
So you know if you're kinda like, ah, shipping and everything.

00:32:00.554 --> 00:32:02.417
No, no, no.

00:32:02.397 --> 00:32:08.703
And last but not least, we have our fluffy fuzzy adventure mat!

00:32:08.723 --> 00:32:15.090
It's a desk mat, you know you can put it underneath your keyboard.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.791
My first desk mat!

00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:17.692
You have your table!

00:32:17.712 --> 00:32:18.633
And the illustration is by Ikoi-sama!

00:32:18.653 --> 00:32:20.495
Very very cute, so we hope you get your paws on it.

00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:27.342
It is available, the pre-orders are only open for a limited time until the end of the month, so we hope you can get it.

00:32:27.322 --> 00:32:44.848
Thank you Ruffians!

00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:54.021
Bye bye!

00:32:54.001 --> 00:33:04.598
You can have the perrocap too, Ruffians!

00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:06.561
And speaking of second anniversary... Advent, we have some very exciting announcements!

00:33:06.582 --> 00:33:11.670
I think Ruffians you might have heard, but there might be some Ruffians that haven't heard too!

00:33:13.052 --> 00:33:16.718
Advent, we have a brand new original song!

00:33:16.698 --> 00:33:20.522
Jonathan!

00:33:20.542 --> 00:33:20.843
Ruffians!

00:33:21.684 --> 00:33:24.807
I think there's been a number of Ruffians listening over and over.

00:33:24.947 --> 00:33:28.952
Thank you so much!

00:33:29.873 --> 00:33:31.495
Jonathan, you like it more?

00:33:32.056 --> 00:33:32.296
Of course!

00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:35.339
But it's very snazzy.

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:39.364
There's a lot going on in a good way.

00:33:39.344 --> 00:33:41.306
You know, you love it!

00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:43.369
FUWAMOCO!

00:33:43.829 --> 00:33:47.553
I feel like Genesis and Rebellion, they go like kind of hand in hand.

00:33:47.894 --> 00:33:51.878
But Genesis definitely shows our growth over the past two years.

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.620
So we're really happy.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.443
The PV is so cool, the MV.

00:33:56.463 --> 00:34:01.389
So we hope that you'll check that out too on the hololive English official channel.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.233
But together with that, there is also

00:34:05.213 --> 00:34:13.143
This was... Okay, yeah, there is also announced the story of Advent!

00:34:13.163 --> 00:34:14.866
Yeah, what is this now?

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:22.456
Together with Genesis, it was announced that Advent, we're gonna be releasing a series of five original songs!

00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:24.578
And it's the story of Advent.

00:34:24.598 --> 00:34:28.343
Genesis being the first one, and then we have maybe some more coming up.

00:34:28.363 --> 00:34:29.945
Do you remember the other song titles?

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:35.052
I don't know if Ruffians know that's the song titles.

00:34:36.871 --> 00:34:38.613
So many!

00:34:39.514 --> 00:34:40.475
You can't wait!

00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:44.840
We are the Ruffians!

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.302
We're so so lucky!

00:34:46.322 --> 00:34:48.865
We can't wait until you can hear them all!

00:34:48.925 --> 00:34:51.128
So please reply to them!

00:34:51.148 --> 00:34:55.773
And in the meantime we'll be really happy to listen to Genesis lots and lots of Ruffians!

00:34:55.933 --> 00:34:58.997
Actually Genesis, we really like Genesis.

00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:03.112
These songs are like morning.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.785
Ruffians!

00:35:05.805 --> 00:35:08.076
If you're like impatient, you wanna hear them now!

00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:10.678
You'll have to wait!

00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:14.925
BAU BAU!

00:35:14.945 --> 00:35:16.868
And also it's our second anniversary!

00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:23.820
It was announced that Advent, we're gonna be having our second anniversary live on the run!

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.681
We're on the run!

00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:25.462
Yeah.

00:35:25.903 --> 00:35:27.105
I don't know why we're on the run.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.748
What are we worried about Moco-chan?

00:35:28.768 --> 00:35:29.208
I don't know why.

00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:31.532
Obviously justice is not much of a threat.

00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:42.017
What are they doing?

00:35:43.821 --> 00:35:49.234
What are they doing?

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:50.942
Wow, time lag.

00:35:52.705 --> 00:35:59.999
But we're gonna be having our 3D 2nd anniversary live on August 29th at 7pm PT.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.388
So we hope that you'll be there to cheer for us, FUWAMOCO!

00:36:05.195 --> 00:36:11.122
You know, even after all for one, there are still more to look forward to!

00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:15.187
We'll continue to do our best so please cheer for Advent!

00:36:15.248 --> 00:36:17.070
August is packed!

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.651
Yes!

00:36:18.552 --> 00:36:25.220
It's gonna be a fun rest of the summer, so... Thank you, Advent!

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:25.560
BAU BAU!

00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:27.423
And, um, I forgot one thing.

00:36:27.623 --> 00:36:28.584
Give me a moment.

00:36:29.045 --> 00:36:29.245
Moco-chan!

00:36:30.136 --> 00:36:33.527
Yes!

00:36:34.068 --> 00:36:34.851
Finally!

00:36:35.874 --> 00:36:41.732
Coming up this weekend, we have hololive English's third concert all for one!

00:36:42.353 --> 00:37:08.935
BAU BAU!

00:37:08.915 --> 00:37:09.316
Oh yeah!

00:37:09.336 --> 00:37:09.957
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:09.977 --> 00:37:10.598
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:13.201 --> 00:37:13.842
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:13.862 --> 00:37:14.483
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:14.503 --> 00:37:15.124
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:15.144 --> 00:37:15.765
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:15.785 --> 00:37:16.426
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:16.446 --> 00:37:17.067
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:17.087 --> 00:37:17.708
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:17.728 --> 00:37:18.349
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:18.990
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.651
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:20.312
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:20.332 --> 00:37:20.953
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:21.674
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:21.694 --> 00:37:22.355
You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

You haven't seen that yet, huh?

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:25.540
You haven't seen that

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:36.351
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:40.643
Have a howl of a day!

00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:43.708
It's gonna be at Radio City Music Hall in New York!

00:37:44.088 --> 00:37:46.512
Happening on August 23rd and 24th!

00:37:46.812 --> 00:37:48.735
And right now, Ruffians!

So please, if you haven't, please get your streaming tickets!

00:37:54.103 --> 00:37:54.183
But!

00:37:54.243 --> 00:37:59.791
If you know maybe you're feeling a little bit adventurous, you want a little bit more excitement this summer!

00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:02.536
There's still some tickets available!

00:38:02.856 --> 00:38:04.458
So we hope that you'll go check it out!

00:38:04.478 --> 00:38:07.523
Maybe you can get your paws on some Radio City Music Hall!

00:38:07.543 --> 00:38:07.763
Yes!

00:38:07.783 --> 00:38:08.925
Radio City!

00:38:08.905 --> 00:38:09.486
Sing it wrong?

00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:10.247
Did I say it wrong?

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.189
I don't think so.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.994
Radio Music City Hall!

00:38:15.237 --> 00:38:16.519
Radio City Music Hall!

00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:19.985
She can't even do her solo, it's okay.

00:38:20.266 --> 00:38:20.807
How was it go?

00:38:20.827 --> 00:38:24.794
A bouquet and a trip to New York right away!

00:38:24.814 --> 00:38:24.894
Wow!

00:38:24.914 --> 00:38:25.175
Amazing!

00:38:25.195 --> 00:38:29.783
I know it's a little bit of a big hurdle but you know!

00:38:29.763 --> 00:38:47.907
Especially for Ruffians!

00:38:47.887 --> 00:39:03.961
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:17.893
We can't wait!

00:39:17.873 --> 00:39:22.220
FUWAMOCO I missed you!

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.802
Thank you Ruffians!

00:39:24.163 --> 00:39:28.530
You know we made so many precious memories with Weeking Dimensions.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.751
We can't wait, you know.

00:39:30.072 --> 00:39:32.836
It's a very special snapshot in time.

00:39:32.856 --> 00:39:36.963
So we can't wait for this special moment together, Ruffians.

00:39:40.228 --> 00:39:40.388
BAU BAU!

00:39:40.992 --> 00:39:44.699
Ah, the week has just started, Moco-chan!

00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.282
And it's a big one, Ruffians!

00:39:46.302 --> 00:39:47.344
Are you excited?

00:39:47.765 --> 00:39:50.190
Maybe there's some things you're a little bit nervous about.

00:39:51.292 --> 00:39:54.518
Especially if you're going to New York for the first time.

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:57.865
Or maybe you're just nervous because it's another week, huh?

00:39:59.188 --> 00:39:59.689
Yeah.

00:39:59.709 --> 00:40:00.290
Are you excited?

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.013
Oh, you're not nervous?

00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:02.494
Yeah.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.168
Well, maybe the Ruffians need to get pumped up a bit.

00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:09.615
P-p-pumped up!

00:40:09.635 --> 00:40:10.056
Yeah!

00:40:11.822 --> 00:40:16.896
Let's get pumped up, Moco-chan!

00:40:17.177 --> 00:40:17.277
Okay!

00:40:26.622 --> 00:40:27.763
Ruffians!

00:40:29.064 --> 00:40:30.766
It's that time again!

00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:34.429
It's time for FUWAMOCO Pup Talk!

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:42.536
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:40:42.556 --> 00:40:42.696
Mococo!

00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:42.977
Ruffians!

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:46.740
Ruffians!

00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:49.823
It's almost time!

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:53.026
For what?

00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:55.768
For what?

00:40:57.925 --> 00:40:59.227
Not school!

00:40:59.247 --> 00:40:59.547
No!

00:41:00.969 --> 00:41:02.671
Not another week week!

00:41:02.691 --> 00:41:03.071
No!

00:41:04.693 --> 00:41:08.097
Forget about that, okay?

00:41:08.117 --> 00:41:10.040
It's time!

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.762
For!

00:41:12.723 --> 00:41:12.943
Everyone!

00:41:13.624 --> 00:41:16.227
The big hololive EN concert!

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.091
You're ready, right?

00:41:20.012 --> 00:41:21.494
No more taxes.

00:41:22.495 --> 00:41:23.416
All for one!

00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:24.818
Got it?

00:41:24.838 --> 00:41:25.298
Yes!

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:26.700
Aliens!

00:41:27.575 --> 00:41:27.935
What?

00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:30.958
All for one!

00:41:31.799 --> 00:41:31.859
Un!

00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:33.660
You ready, right?

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.120
Yeah?

00:41:36.442 --> 00:41:38.504
No?

00:41:38.524 --> 00:41:39.025
It's okay.

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:41.667
Let's practice, okay?

00:41:43.108 --> 00:41:43.648
Not to me.

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:46.010
Keep quiet.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.734
All for one!

00:41:51.035 --> 00:41:51.135
Yeah.

00:41:52.136 --> 00:41:56.059
All for one!

00:41:56.819 --> 00:41:56.920
Yeah.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.040
Fuwa!

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:57.480
Fuwa!

00:41:58.945 --> 00:41:59.946
Moco!

00:42:00.587 --> 00:42:00.687
Moco!

00:42:02.689 --> 00:42:04.070
Let's get ready, okay?

00:42:05.132 --> 00:42:07.214
Can you say the three magic words?

00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:09.757
Along with me, okay?

00:42:10.738 --> 00:42:11.258
Okay, here we go.

00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:16.344
Three, two, one.

00:42:16.364 --> 00:42:17.985
All for one!

00:42:18.866 --> 00:42:25.273
Let's be excited for it and look forward to all... Look forward to it all week, okay?

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.288
Hopefully I don't trip on stage.

00:42:33.308 --> 00:42:33.468
BAU BAU!

00:42:33.488 --> 00:42:34.089
GANBATTE DE!

00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:35.571
BAU BAU!

00:42:35.711 --> 00:42:37.955
Are you gonna be okay, BAU MOCO-CHAN?

00:42:37.975 --> 00:42:40.598
I messed up the pup talk.

00:42:40.618 --> 00:42:43.903
Oh, then that means I won't mess up over one, right?

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:50.914
That's how it works.

00:42:50.934 --> 00:42:51.094
BAU BAU!

00:42:51.234 --> 00:42:56.001
Let's do our best, okay, BAU BAU?

00:42:56.021 --> 00:42:57.724
Shall we take a look at...

00:42:58.649 --> 00:42:59.831
Regular cornice.

00:43:00.352 --> 00:43:01.293
Regular cornice!

00:43:01.374 --> 00:43:04.338
Do you have a Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

00:43:04.358 --> 00:43:05.020
Let's look!

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:11.230
Our Doggie of the Day is... It's Kobe!

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.011
BAU BAU!

00:43:12.031 --> 00:43:12.532
Kobe Kobe?

00:43:12.913 --> 00:43:13.834
Kobe?

00:43:14.595 --> 00:43:15.196
Kobe Kobe?

00:43:15.777 --> 00:43:16.759
BAU BAU!

00:43:16.739 --> 00:43:20.565
It's so cute!

00:43:21.066 --> 00:43:22.609
Is that a pom-pom hat?

00:43:22.629 --> 00:43:24.392
It's a pom-pom hat, Moco-chan!

00:43:24.412 --> 00:43:26.576
He's so cute!

00:43:26.596 --> 00:43:28.779
That's a good tongue.

00:43:28.799 --> 00:43:30.923
There, you have ears that smile.

00:43:31.604 --> 00:43:35.811
I think somebody knows it's their birthday.

00:43:35.791 --> 00:43:39.036
You guys are so cute!

00:43:39.276 --> 00:43:41.299
He's six years old.

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:43.362
Six years old doesn't look it.

00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:47.247
He used to be so small, but look at him now!

00:43:47.267 --> 00:43:48.709
He's kind of chunky.

00:43:48.749 --> 00:43:54.277
Time flies when you have a loud barker.

00:43:55.178 --> 00:43:56.200
Is that how it works?

00:43:57.942 --> 00:43:59.564
How does Kobe BAU BAU?

00:44:02.689 --> 00:44:03.590
Kobe birthday?

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.713
I think it's something like

00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:21.469
That's cute, don't you know?

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:34.863
I think it's okay to be loud when you're so cute like that.

00:44:35.263 --> 00:44:37.185
And hot.

00:44:38.026 --> 00:44:39.467
We're even cuter, right?

00:44:39.948 --> 00:44:41.149
Pom-pom hat accepted!

00:44:41.169 --> 00:44:42.671
We don't know that either, right?

00:44:43.532 --> 00:44:44.232
Yeah.

00:44:44.252 --> 00:44:45.714
Not like we're wearing hats too.

00:44:46.915 --> 00:44:50.839
BAU BAU!

00:44:50.859 --> 00:44:52.440
Happy birthday!

00:44:52.721 --> 00:44:53.582
Happy birthday, Kobe.

00:44:53.602 --> 00:44:56.505
Boy, today I went on a walk we haven't!

00:44:56.705 --> 00:44:58.066
De-den!

00:44:59.688 --> 00:45:01.730
That is a hike.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.932
How high did you go up?

00:45:04.216 --> 00:45:14.674
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:28.317
Have a howl of a day!

00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:29.520
I'm going on a hike.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.586
I want to match the mountain.

00:45:32.087 --> 00:45:34.754
Just looking at this makes me want to go outside.

00:45:34.814 --> 00:45:36.559
It's time for a walk!

00:45:38.363 --> 00:45:38.464
Okay!

00:45:38.484 --> 00:45:38.644
BAU BAU!

00:45:39.535 --> 00:45:42.999
And the Question of the Day!

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:46.883
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:45:47.884 --> 00:45:49.125
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:52.129
Some days you might not be feeling the brightest.

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:53.951
Maybe you woke up on the wrong paw.

00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:57.875
And I wanted to know, what do you like to do when that happens?

00:46:00.498 --> 00:46:00.878
BAU BAU!

00:46:01.239 --> 00:46:01.399
BAU BAU!

00:46:01.419 --> 00:46:06.184
Well, you know... We're not humans, we're demon dogs, but you know...

00:46:06.923 --> 00:46:10.407
We're just like everyone, we have good days and bad days, you know?

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.531
And you know just the other day?

00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:15.594
We did not have a good day.

00:46:15.834 --> 00:46:19.058
We woke up and we're like, okay, it's good and we're gonna do our best.

00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:21.161
Confidence, yes!

00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:23.404
We're preparing lots and lots.

00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:25.387
Night before, very good.

00:46:25.787 --> 00:46:27.109
All prepared, good good.

00:46:30.974 --> 00:46:31.294
No.

00:46:32.354 --> 00:46:38.284
But I think, you know, on those days when you're just like, this is not going well, it's a bad day.

00:46:38.304 --> 00:46:40.809
You have to be kind to yourself.

00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:42.592
You have to forgive yourself.

00:46:43.894 --> 00:46:45.096
It just happens, you know?

00:46:46.719 --> 00:46:51.007
So in any areas that you're like, okay, if I can do this, then that'll make things better.

00:46:51.047 --> 00:46:54.733
Even just a little bit, do that, okay, Ruffians?

00:46:55.523 --> 00:46:57.725
Give yourself a little bit more wiggle room.

00:46:59.046 --> 00:47:00.368
A little bit more forgiveness.

00:47:00.708 --> 00:47:03.030
I mean, you should forgive yourself all the time, you know?

00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:05.052
None of us are perfect, you know?

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.114
We all have bad days.

00:47:07.134 --> 00:47:13.440
But maybe on the days that just don't go right, just a little bit more kindness.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.865
You know, FUWAMOCO, we're lucky because we have each other by our sides all the time too.

00:47:18.885 --> 00:47:21.548
When we have a bad day, we don't have to say anything.

00:47:22.068 --> 00:47:22.529
I know.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.552
Moco-chan's having a bad day.

00:47:25.413 --> 00:47:32.805
Don't even have to say it, it's just... We hope we can be there to make a bad day a little bit better for you.

00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:34.247
If we could do that, that would be great.

00:47:34.728 --> 00:47:37.212
That would make us really, really happy.

00:47:37.232 --> 00:47:37.612
And hopefully more!

00:47:37.893 --> 00:47:39.956
Today's gonna be a good day!

00:47:40.156 --> 00:47:40.577
Good week!

00:47:40.677 --> 00:47:42.801
No wrong paws, only the right paws.

00:47:42.841 --> 00:47:43.722
Yeah.

00:47:43.742 --> 00:47:44.363
Okay?

00:47:44.343 --> 00:47:47.208
BAU BAU!

00:47:47.228 --> 00:47:47.809
Thank you!

00:47:47.869 --> 00:47:50.093
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:47:50.413 --> 00:47:54.139
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning is temporarily once a week on Mondays.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.984
But we're still looking for submissions!

00:47:57.325 --> 00:47:58.486
Don't forget your submissions!

00:47:58.607 --> 00:48:00.330
I see you there forgetting me.

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:04.637
I don't have this question, and now I forgot, but I wanted to ask it.

00:48:05.077 --> 00:48:09.324
I'm so glad I have this really good walk, but there's this really good volume.

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.266
Oh, it might have been Pero.

00:48:10.246 --> 00:48:17.053
Please submit with the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:48:17.073 --> 00:48:17.714
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:48:18.114 --> 00:48:19.996
We make it together with you.

00:48:20.096 --> 00:48:21.638
You don't know what to submit?

00:48:21.658 --> 00:48:21.938
Submit!

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:24.601
We're waiting, okay?

00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:27.244
BAU BAU!

00:48:28.145 --> 00:48:31.989
And FUWAMOCO, we have another stream coming up right, Moco-chan.

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:33.891
We have De-den!

00:48:34.293 --> 00:48:38.559
Today we're gonna be playing Okayunyumu!

00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:44.548
Okayu-senpai recently had a visual novel game where you spend your life together with Okayu-senpai.

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:49.234
And the English version just came out and you know visual novels are kind of a thing.

00:48:49.495 --> 00:48:51.177
So of course we're gonna be playing it.

00:48:51.197 --> 00:48:55.443
We're gonna be playing it together with you, Ruffians, as far as we can!

00:48:55.623 --> 00:48:56.425
And we're really excited.

00:48:56.445 --> 00:48:59.950
You know we played all of... where are you from?

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.393
So now we get to experience Okayunyumu mode!

00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:12.999
Ruffians, you know we mentioned the cheering space?

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.766
We'd really be happy if you cheered for us there too.

00:49:16.368 --> 00:49:17.631
All for one.

00:49:17.611 --> 00:49:21.254
After that, we're going to be going back to the Northwest Positive.

00:49:21.274 --> 00:49:26.018
But during that period, we'll also be having shorts.

00:49:26.058 --> 00:49:29.682
Some shorts that we worked very hard on being uploaded to our channel.

00:49:29.702 --> 00:49:33.925
So we hope that you'll be checking back and checking those out.

00:49:34.226 --> 00:49:36.367
Please look forward to them, okay?

00:49:37.108 --> 00:49:39.070
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:47.297
And for Ruffians joining us on the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU open wide!

00:49:47.277 --> 00:49:50.980

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:58.667
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:49:59.008 --> 00:50:17.284
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:28.827
FUWAMOCO!

00:50:29.701 --> 00:50:31.423
I saw Huey.

00:50:31.944 --> 00:50:33.426
BAU BAU!

00:50:33.667 --> 00:50:34.568
Human Porn.

00:50:35.129 --> 00:50:36.531
BAU BAU!

00:50:37.392 --> 00:50:37.492

00:50:40.076 --> 00:50:40.777

BAU BAU!

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.902
Playing with Pup.

00:50:44.362 --> 00:50:45.844
BAU BAU!

00:50:46.205 --> 00:50:53.355
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:50:53.816 --> 00:50:55.218
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:50:55.498 --> 00:50:57.902
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:50:58.222 --> 00:50:58.763
BAU BAU!

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.093
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!
