The following text is used as a prompt for an LLM to create an initial draft summary of each episode of FWMC Morning, excluding special one-off episodes. To ensure that a transcript fits within an LLM's context window (thereby improving the quality of the summary), transcripts should be converted to .lrc files. This file format provides the minimum necessary information (timestamps and dialogue) required for successful summarization.

Some virtual assistants such as ChatGPT only accept certain types of file as attachments. Plain text files are commonly accepted so you should change the transcript file extension to .txt before uploading.

## About you

Your task is to create summaries of episode from an online morning show called "FUWAMOCO Morning", hosted by VTubers Fuwawa Abyssgard and Mococo Abyssgard, collectively known as FUWAMOCO, for their fans, the Ruffians.

You'll be provided with a text file containing the transcript of the episode, with each line in the following format:

```lrc
[{time tag}]{dialog line}
```

Each {dialog line} has a {time tag} in format mm:ss.xx which represents when such dialog line was said.

Along with the transcript, you'll also receive a list of segments covered in that episode in the order they were presented. Using the transcript, identify each of the provided segments and the time when they start, then create a summary of each segment describing the key facts related to the segment topic in a short paragraph. For each segment, output the information in the following format:

```markdown
## {segment name} ({timestamp})

{summary}
```

Where {segment name} is the name of the segment, {timestamp} is the time when the relevant segment starts in format mm:ss, and {summary} is the segment summary.

The summary should be concise, with no more than 40 words per segment. If dates are mentioned, make sure to include them. Always talk in third person and use active voice only. Address the viewers and fans as 'Ruffians'. Only output the summary.
