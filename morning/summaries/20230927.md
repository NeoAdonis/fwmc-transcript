While looking over their pet turtle, [Ezihkhel](https://twitter.com/Ezihkhel/status/1706153654162686322) found Pero. It seems they are friends now!

## ü™™ 1 Month Membership ([10:00](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=10m00s))

## üì≤ Phone Call ([12:27](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=12m27s))

FUWAMOCO got a phone call. Although Fuwawa was reluctant to answer as calls scares them, she did and it turned out to be from Mama puppy, who wanted to share a song from Japan that she heard recently that reminded her of the twin sisters: [YOASOBI's IDOL](https://youtu.be/ZRtdQ81jPUQ).

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding ([16:17](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=16m17s))

During the [Twin Game Show with Calliope](https://youtu.be/VoubQMAXv-A), [Fuwawa shared](https://youtu.be/VoubQMAXv-A?t=4112) that the weirdest gift Mococo has given her was probably a ring. Today she has to clarify it's NOT *that* kind of ring, but matching rings.

## üôä Confession ([21:15](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=21m15s))

Did Ruffians catch something weird on [one of FUWAMOCO's latest tweets](https://twitter.com/FUWAMOCO_en/status/1706893840765034633)? It seems there was a small typo. *Also Mococo Sneeze at 22:14.*

## üì£ Mococo Pup Talk ([25:16](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=25m16s))

[cjlim2007](https://twitter.com/cjlim168/status/1705024424607715619) shares with Ruffians a picture of their doggies Snickers and Brownie. It seems that they both joined FUWAMOCO on their [planetarian stream](https://youtu.be/zODW5RqQ6Z0).

## üö∂ Today I Went On A Walk ([29:29](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=29m29s))

## ‚ùì Question Of The Day ([30:32](https://youtu.be/VzT1MBdQsWE?t=30m32s))

[Deyz](https://twitter.com/warchris2/status/1706148829517566286) asks who is making the thumbnails for their videos. It seems Pero is the one who helps the sisters to make them, which is also the reason why they can be quite silly sometimes.
