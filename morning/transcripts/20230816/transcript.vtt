05:11.165 --> 05:14.400
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:14.690  --> 05:18.741
It's time for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:18.761 --> 05:22.604
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.784 --> 05:25.807
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:25.827 --> 05:26.828
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:26.988 --> 05:27.788
BAU BAU!

05:36.055 --> 05:39.618
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:40.579 --> 05:42.301
Like, no other FUWAMOCO Morning.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.722
It's something new, right?

05:44.383 --> 05:48.907
Thank you for joining us for our 7th episode!

05:48.927 --> 05:49.488
7 already!

05:54.232 --> 06:00.416
To explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:00.936 --> 06:05.159
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:05.439 --> 06:10.063
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:10.843 --> 06:15.484
Please make sure to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING.

06:15.504 --> 06:20.545
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:21.025 --> 06:23.126
BAU BAU!

06:24.246 --> 06:25.746
Ruffians, good morning!

06:26.086 --> 06:28.187
Good morning, BAU BAU!

06:28.207 --> 06:37.529
Well, to start the day off, we have another... There's been another... Pero Sighting!

06:39.444 --> 06:40.785
Everyone was holding their breath there.

06:40.805 --> 06:41.505
So long!

06:41.885 --> 06:43.226
Where did we find Pero this time?

06:43.246 --> 06:44.507
Ruffians, where did you find him?

06:45.167 --> 06:47.348
De-den!

06:47.868 --> 06:49.589
Pero, what are you doing?

06:49.849 --> 06:50.650
Wait, wait.

06:51.510 --> 06:57.313
He's the more of an Asian in the Philippines.

06:58.114 --> 06:59.514
He's Pero-ing it.

07:02.476 --> 07:02.956
Pero!

07:03.396 --> 07:03.756
Pero!

07:06.178 --> 07:07.260
You have to stop that, okay?

07:07.280 --> 07:08.742
It's a mall, so you should be.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.643
Is that what you're saying?

07:21.917 --> 07:26.660
In Pero's defense though, you know, it does look kind of interesting to look, right?

07:26.680 --> 07:27.681
Like a big candy.

07:27.741 --> 07:29.302
Like, what would it taste like, you know?

07:29.643 --> 07:32.805
Maybe like a bit zappy, like Pop Rocks?

07:32.865 --> 07:34.026
Zappy zappy.

07:34.046 --> 07:34.826
Like Biboo, eh?

07:35.327 --> 07:35.727
Biboo?

07:36.067 --> 07:37.308
Ah, Kami-senpai!

07:37.768 --> 07:41.151
Good morning!

07:41.171 --> 07:42.412
Maybe like Biboo?

07:42.912 --> 07:43.713
Oh, it tastes like Biboo.

07:43.813 --> 07:45.034
I was thinking the zappy part.

07:45.114 --> 07:47.035
Oh, maybe Biboo could be a zappy taste too?

07:47.055 --> 07:47.856
Pop Rocks, Pop Rocks.

07:48.036 --> 07:48.236
No.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.497
Right.

07:49.517 --> 07:49.637
Yeah.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.781
But hopefully he doesn't drive away any customers, right?

07:52.841 --> 07:54.043
They need their business, too.

07:54.063 --> 07:56.427
It's a mall after all, right?

07:56.527 --> 07:57.829
But, I don't know.

07:57.909 --> 08:03.037
It would be helpful if maybe the mall security could shoo him back to our way, you know?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.060
Send him back over here, you know?

08:06.521 --> 08:10.283
Well, Ruffians, if you see Pero again, please let us know.

08:10.363 --> 08:13.124
You don't have to let you know.

08:13.164 --> 08:15.005
You already know if you see him.

08:15.345 --> 08:20.288
Let us know if you have any more sightings if you use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

08:22.248 --> 08:23.549
I hope we can get Pero back soon.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.930
Will he come back home soon?

08:26.771 --> 08:27.351
Do we need him?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.969
Not really, but it just doesn't feel right, you know?

08:31.009 --> 08:33.249
Doesn't feel right.

08:33.589 --> 08:35.570
We're out in good news!

08:35.890 --> 08:36.630
Good news!

08:36.650 --> 08:37.831
Did you notice, Ruffians?

08:37.891 --> 08:38.691
Ruffians!

08:39.451 --> 08:42.092
You know what happened last time?

08:42.112 --> 08:42.372
De-den!

08:42.572 --> 08:45.133
Awesome!

08:45.453 --> 08:46.693
We can't believe it!

08:46.994 --> 08:51.515
We've reached 1 million views on our debut stream!

08:51.615 --> 08:53.316
BAU BAU!

08:53.656 --> 08:54.516
We're so happy.

08:54.756 --> 08:56.977
It's also really crazy too, right?

08:57.277 --> 08:57.597
Crazy.

08:59.999 --> 09:06.364
There are over 1 million ruffians out there now, right?

09:06.404 --> 09:09.866
What if some ruffians watched it like a thousand times each?

09:13.527 --> 09:14.648
That was a ruffian.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.309
In their heart.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.931
And they're a ruffian in my heart.

09:18.071 --> 09:19.172
I see, I see.

09:19.613 --> 09:23.756
Like to us, if you know FUWAMOCO, you're a ruffian.

09:23.776 --> 09:25.218
To us.

09:25.258 --> 09:28.661
Maybe you don't feel that way, but I'm sorry, that's how we feel.

09:28.821 --> 09:32.504
If you feel like, nah, I'm not a ruffian, I don't want to be a ruffian, that's okay.

09:32.544 --> 09:34.306
That's okay too.

09:34.386 --> 09:36.668
We'll just be waiting here forever and ever for you.

09:37.609 --> 09:38.010
Watch out.

09:38.090 --> 09:41.914
We're gonna protect your smile.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.476
You won't even know, okay?

09:43.536 --> 09:44.157
You won't know it.

09:46.119 --> 09:51.305
But you know, now that it's been a little while since our debut, we've gotten to know each other a bit more.

09:52.222 --> 09:55.344
Ruffians, what were your favorite moments from our debut?

09:55.424 --> 09:56.204
We were nervous.

09:57.445 --> 09:58.166
Did you like it?

09:58.186 --> 10:00.667
I guess if a million people liked it, maybe they'd like it.

10:00.847 --> 10:03.549
Or watched it, maybe they'd watch it.

10:03.609 --> 10:05.070
I was like, oh!

10:05.110 --> 10:07.091
That's a positive way of thinking!

10:11.094 --> 10:16.058
Lifetime Showtime!

10:16.078 --> 10:17.960
Your favorite part was the BAU BAU part.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.121
Do not the tail.

10:20.282 --> 10:21.943
Don't touch the fuzz.

10:22.024 --> 10:25.106
You remember, do not the ears either, right?

10:25.366 --> 10:27.188
Both parts are important, you know?

10:27.749 --> 10:28.389
The first part.

10:28.589 --> 10:29.470
What about the middle part?

10:29.490 --> 10:30.311
What about the last part?

10:32.012 --> 10:33.934
Thank you, Ruffians!

10:34.034 --> 10:39.317
Well now, I guess it's just gonna be a good memory that we share all together, right?

10:39.658 --> 10:41.979
The start of our journey together.

10:41.999 --> 10:45.401
Thank you, Ruffians!

10:45.522 --> 10:51.586
Ruffians, you remember what happened last FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

10:52.808 --> 10:53.189
Right.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.552
We had something good happen, right?

10:55.612 --> 10:55.972
We did!

10:56.032 --> 10:57.434
There was some really good news.

10:57.854 --> 11:00.297
I guess, you know, Rebellion hit 1 million views.

11:00.317 --> 11:01.619
There's a lot of good news.

11:01.819 --> 11:05.183
You know, which is even more good news is our debut.

11:06.565 --> 11:11.091
But... But... De-den.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.647
There's been another misunderstanding.

11:17.269 --> 11:24.263
We thought that maybe, you know, we'd be able to reach today and not have another misunderstanding that we'd be safe.

11:26.946 --> 11:27.827
We're not perfect.

11:28.167 --> 11:28.888
Not at all.

11:28.928 --> 11:30.770
There's been another misunderstanding.

11:32.151 --> 11:36.715
Just a few hours ago earlier in a Japanese chatting stream.

11:37.016 --> 11:38.157
A fresh misunderstanding.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.338
And it wasn't my fault.

11:40.779 --> 11:41.740
Mococo is good.

11:41.900 --> 11:42.881
I'm clear.

11:43.222 --> 11:44.583
I said something I shouldn't have.

11:45.504 --> 11:46.365
I made a mistake.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.846
That's surprising, huh?

11:47.886 --> 11:49.167
Saying something you shouldn't have?

11:51.269 --> 11:57.170
I messed up my words a little, and I might have accidentally created a new food.

11:57.650 --> 12:01.531
A new food called Hayashi Chuka.

12:02.531 --> 12:04.052
See, there's two foods.

12:04.072 --> 12:09.393
There's Hiyashi Chuka, which is like a cold noodle that's on the left there.

12:09.613 --> 12:13.754
And there's Hayashi Rice, which is like... Hayashi sauce is like a...

12:15.134 --> 12:16.135
Like a hashed beef.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.255
Yeah, sort of thing.

12:17.275 --> 12:17.716
Yeah.

12:17.756 --> 12:17.876
No.

12:35.527 --> 12:36.668
And now, you know what?

12:37.269 --> 12:37.929
You know what?

12:38.590 --> 12:42.894
Now there's a lot of Ruffians making the Hayashi Chuka!

12:43.074 --> 12:43.894
Yeah!

12:44.235 --> 12:45.155
So fast!

12:45.296 --> 12:47.137
Already making Hayashi Chuka.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.079
Please don't get tummy aches, okay?

12:49.119 --> 12:49.900
Yeah, no tummy aches.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.840
It's not our fault, okay?

12:50.940 --> 12:53.262
If you get a tummy ache.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.965
You know, Hayashi Chuka is yummy.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.926
Hayashi Chuka is really yummy.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.188
And Hayashi Rice is really yummy.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.530
But together...

13:03.541 --> 13:04.081
BAU BAU!

13:14.395 --> 13:16.736
I think maybe the ruffians are just being nice.

13:18.456 --> 13:19.136
Maybe a bit nice.

13:19.156 --> 13:20.356
The ruffians are very nice.

13:21.737 --> 13:22.757
Don't mix it!

13:23.037 --> 13:24.277
Don't mix it!

13:24.437 --> 13:26.378
No mixing.

13:26.518 --> 13:29.078
I don't think that'll be very pleasant.

13:29.998 --> 13:35.960
Please make sure you enjoy your Hiyashi Chuka as Hiyashi Chuka and your Hayashi Rice as Hayashi Rice.

13:36.220 --> 13:36.680
Okay!

13:36.700 --> 13:37.600
Wow.

13:37.620 --> 13:37.780
Savvy.

13:42.141 --> 13:44.502
There has been another misunderstanding.

13:46.082 --> 13:52.903
But you know, this time, this time, Ruffians, it's not our fault.

13:53.924 --> 13:54.504
It's not!

13:54.664 --> 13:55.724
It's not our fault!

13:55.744 --> 13:57.324
It's not our fault!

13:57.364 --> 14:04.346
No, this time, we actually have a very special video appearance from a certain Advent member.

14:04.826 --> 14:06.086
Yeah, what's the problem?

14:06.206 --> 14:08.007
Okay, let's take a look here then.

14:08.027 --> 14:08.107
Okay.

14:08.247 --> 14:08.507
BAU BAU!

14:17.833 --> 14:24.636
Jailbirds, Adventrix, and hololive fans alike, I have a misunderstanding that I need to clear up.

14:25.276 --> 14:28.738
Sadly, this misunderstanding was caused by no one except myself.

14:29.418 --> 14:39.802
You see, during my debut stream, I was so nervous, as you could probably tell, and when I was describing my Japanese language skills, I accidentally said that I could read 2,000 kanji.

14:40.262 --> 14:42.443
What I meant to say is, I know 2,000 Japanese words.

14:44.384 --> 14:49.308
I only know about maybe a thousand kanji, and even then it's not every single reading of them.

14:50.049 --> 14:53.172
It's just a few, and it's if they're in words that I know.

14:53.712 --> 14:55.854
So I know the general meaning, but that's it.

14:56.554 --> 15:00.758
I'm really sorry for this horrible misunderstanding, and I hope you guys can forgive me.

15:00.778 --> 15:10.146
No reisai!

15:11.087 --> 15:12.088
No reisai!

15:13.524 --> 15:16.547
Ruffians, what do you think?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.248
She should feel bad!

15:17.268 --> 15:20.892
Unforgivable very very bad!

15:20.932 --> 15:21.493
What do you think?

15:34.389 --> 15:34.710
No!

15:35.331 --> 15:35.751
No!

15:36.032 --> 15:36.412
What?

15:36.512 --> 15:37.934
It's an easy mistake!

15:39.156 --> 15:39.837
Unforgivable.

15:40.378 --> 15:41.539
Wait, how could she?

15:41.579 --> 15:42.400
How could she?

15:42.480 --> 15:43.061
Why?

15:43.582 --> 15:43.882
Yeah.

15:43.982 --> 15:46.466
It's an easy... Dogeza.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.709
I want to see the versus Dogeza.

15:52.154 --> 15:56.259
You know, it's an easy mistake.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.984
When she said that during debut, we were both really surprised.

16:00.004 --> 16:01.967
We were like, what?

16:02.127 --> 16:04.831
She's super strong in Japanese.

16:04.851 --> 16:05.472
What's she hiding?

16:08.576 --> 16:10.218
Why is she hiding from us sort of thing?

16:10.258 --> 16:12.319
It makes sense now, you know?

16:12.400 --> 16:18.205
But, you know, understanding 2,000 words and knowing a thousand kanji, that's really amazing!

16:18.265 --> 16:19.506
It's really amazing.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.327
Right!

16:20.487 --> 16:23.149
You know, she should be very, very, very proud of that accomplishment.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.171
And you know, you can sort of understand.

16:25.191 --> 16:28.334
You know, debut is a very nerve-wracking time.

16:28.374 --> 16:31.917
You can sort of be like... And all the words come out.

16:31.937 --> 16:32.237
I'm a...

16:34.278 --> 16:35.359
Demon... Dark God.

16:36.079 --> 16:40.524
Dark God!

16:40.864 --> 16:43.887
That never happened, we never said that.

16:44.068 --> 16:48.392
Ruffians, what about you?

16:48.612 --> 16:51.175
Do you know 2,000 words and 1,000 kanji?

16:52.796 --> 16:54.598
How is your Japanese language journey going?

16:54.698 --> 16:56.220
I'm curious, honestly!

16:57.970 --> 16:59.631
It doesn't have to be a big journey.

16:59.972 --> 17:01.033
Right, right.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.094
2,000 words is amazing, right?

17:02.154 --> 17:02.594
Right!

17:02.794 --> 17:03.955
M4 level, right?

17:04.956 --> 17:05.356
Two!

17:05.556 --> 17:05.877
See?

17:06.237 --> 17:07.778
That's two more than zero, though.

17:07.938 --> 17:08.339
Yeah.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.722
So you should honestly be, like, proud of that.

17:12.062 --> 17:13.243
Right, you know.

17:13.823 --> 17:15.405
Even if you're still just at the beginning.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.946
It's something good, okay?

17:17.086 --> 17:17.867
Yeah.

17:18.047 --> 17:18.968
Right?

17:19.408 --> 17:19.628
Yeah.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.210
Now we all understand, right?

17:21.710 --> 17:22.471
Right, Ruffians?

17:22.611 --> 17:23.111
Jailbirds?

17:23.632 --> 17:24.132
Frenchicks?

17:24.412 --> 17:24.673
Yeah.

17:25.213 --> 17:26.014
Nurses Forgiven?

17:27.657 --> 17:28.017
Forgiven?

17:28.037 --> 17:28.378
Yeah.

17:28.678 --> 17:30.279
She doesn't need to go back into the cell?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.780
Go back?

17:33.101 --> 17:33.662
She's good?

17:34.262 --> 17:34.522
Yes?

17:34.582 --> 17:35.223
She's forgiven?

17:35.243 --> 17:35.283
No!

17:38.385 --> 17:38.645
Yes?

17:38.986 --> 17:39.226
Yes.

17:39.546 --> 17:39.706
Yes?

17:39.726 --> 17:39.986
Yes.

17:40.527 --> 17:45.971
I think so, but I would still kind of like to be able to see it together.

17:45.991 --> 17:46.051
Why?

17:46.071 --> 17:48.433
3D debut, that's the first thing.

17:48.453 --> 17:49.093
Ah, okay.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.315
That sounds good.

17:51.335 --> 17:52.396
That sounds like it makes sense.

17:53.116 --> 17:55.979
Ruffian Sabers, don't you want to see that?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.130
Nerissa on the ground.

17:58.691 --> 18:01.213
Dogeza-ing.

18:01.353 --> 18:02.133
I'm sorry.

18:02.173 --> 18:02.994
Dogeza-ing.

18:03.114 --> 18:06.477
Dogeza-ing.

18:06.557 --> 18:08.799
I think that would be a good... What does that mean?

18:14.935 --> 18:15.616
It's forgiven.

18:16.436 --> 18:19.718
We love you Nobisa, don't worry.

18:20.038 --> 18:23.241
I still want to see the look of Doggy-san.

18:23.581 --> 18:26.223
Today we have a new segment.

18:26.343 --> 18:27.203
A new corner.

18:27.263 --> 18:29.565
Maybe it's gonna be a bit of a rarer one.

18:29.785 --> 18:30.085
De-den!

18:30.125 --> 18:31.646
Today's Dream!

18:35.322 --> 18:36.163
Yes, yes.

18:36.703 --> 18:39.665
Today's new corner.

18:39.845 --> 18:44.669
In case you didn't know, both of us, we can be pretty avid dreamers.

18:44.729 --> 18:46.510
Both when we're awake and when we're sleeping.

18:46.550 --> 18:50.372
Yeah, in case you couldn't tell by the big golden dreams list, you know.

18:50.393 --> 18:52.334
Yeah, you know, and sometimes...

18:53.049 --> 18:54.951
They can both be very intense.

18:56.153 --> 19:00.317
But today, we're gonna take a look at Mococo's dream.

19:00.357 --> 19:01.639
Moco-chan, what was your dream like?

19:01.779 --> 19:02.940
Can you let us know the details?

19:03.341 --> 19:04.862
So listen closely, okay?

19:05.083 --> 19:06.344
I'm only gonna say it once.

19:06.404 --> 19:07.225
I'm all ears.

19:10.129 --> 19:13.654
I was in... Now, now, this is, this is a real, real deal.

19:13.814 --> 19:14.655
It's real, it's not made up.

19:14.835 --> 19:17.498
I'm not... That's why this is a rare corner, because it's real.

19:17.939 --> 19:21.063
So I was in a classroom filled with a bunch of ruffians.

19:21.624 --> 19:22.024
Okay?

19:23.847 --> 19:26.310
Then my tummy, it started to grumble.

19:27.051 --> 19:28.532
And it let out a really big...

19:29.670 --> 19:29.730
Wow.

19:47.810 --> 19:51.932
Then suddenly, everyone around me started crying because of the song.

19:51.952 --> 19:57.314
And then I told them that it's okay, don't worry, cheer up!

19:57.834 --> 19:59.875
It was just that nostalgic.

19:59.975 --> 20:01.056
It brought back the feels.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.517
That was my dream.

20:05.557 --> 20:08.519
Must have been a really big one.

20:10.629 --> 20:13.191
What do you think, ruffians?

20:13.271 --> 20:16.953
You're one of the ruffians in a dream?

20:26.212 --> 20:26.693
I'm sure.

20:26.873 --> 20:27.354
I'm sure.

20:29.297 --> 20:30.378
What is your instrument?

20:30.638 --> 20:31.660
What do you mean?

20:31.700 --> 20:32.421
It was my tummy.

20:32.481 --> 20:32.962
Your tummy?

20:33.322 --> 20:37.729
Shiny, smiley tummy.

20:37.809 --> 20:39.071
Well, that was Moco-chan's dream.

20:39.091 --> 20:40.473
Usually, Fuwawa dreams more.

20:42.990 --> 20:44.271
My dreams can be something.

20:44.391 --> 20:45.171
They're very long.

20:45.191 --> 20:48.712
I'd like you to know all the details, how I felt.

20:49.293 --> 20:51.413
What the temperature was like, those kind of things, you know?

20:51.433 --> 20:53.554
It's necessary.

20:53.694 --> 20:54.875
I don't think it's that necessary.

20:54.895 --> 20:55.875
Moco-chan's went to the point.

20:55.895 --> 20:57.096
To the point, yeah.

20:57.576 --> 20:58.256
Everyone cried.

20:58.596 --> 21:00.657
That's one of the differences with us as twins.

21:01.057 --> 21:03.278
We explain our dreams differently.

21:04.059 --> 21:08.740
Good to know!

21:09.641 --> 21:09.941
Next!

21:10.321 --> 21:12.422
We talked about this next part in our

21:14.377 --> 21:22.700
We didn't have much time to really talk about it, so we thought that it was important to talk maybe a bit more about it.

21:22.980 --> 21:28.961
What we'd like to talk about today is we love cats!

21:29.522 --> 21:29.922
Cats!

21:31.162 --> 21:32.322
That's a steak, you know?

21:32.382 --> 21:32.763
Right there.

21:34.603 --> 21:37.945
Yeah, and now I know there's a lot of cat lovers at hololive.

21:37.965 --> 21:38.585
Yeah, right.

21:39.065 --> 21:43.947
But, I'm kind of tempted to say that we're the biggest cat lovers.

21:44.468 --> 21:46.528
I would say that we're the biggest cat lovers.

21:46.989 --> 21:52.571
You know, like we said in my debut, you know, kittens are good for eating, and cats are for huffing.

21:53.011 --> 21:57.733
Hugging is good too, but particularly huffing is really, really good.

21:57.753 --> 21:59.974
Yeah, like the big gunka gunka.

22:00.074 --> 22:02.796
And we like cats more than kittens because, you know,

22:03.516 --> 22:08.799
Kittens are good, but the great part of cats is their personality.

22:09.080 --> 22:15.484
Some of them are sort of like spicy, and some of them are sort of friendly, and some are clingy, and some are just loud.

22:15.944 --> 22:17.965
Loud cats are cute!

22:19.566 --> 22:24.627
You know, kittens haven't really developed those personalities yet, so that's why.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.767
They're just like, oh, I'm cute!

22:25.787 --> 22:26.727
Look, I'm gonna fall over!

22:26.747 --> 22:27.568
Look at my tail!

22:27.628 --> 22:28.948
Oh, I don't know how to do it!

22:29.028 --> 22:29.428
You know?

22:29.688 --> 22:33.509
You just see them and you just want to eat them, right?

22:34.089 --> 22:34.689
You know cats?

22:35.349 --> 22:37.390
They're fully matured!

22:37.630 --> 22:38.990
They have personality!

22:39.010 --> 22:40.230
They're cute, too!

22:40.530 --> 22:42.611
You know, but you can get to know them.

22:42.731 --> 22:46.571
Yeah, you can sort of figure out what makes them happy, what makes them sort of angry.

22:49.412 --> 22:51.253
You know, like, even with the ears.

22:52.534 --> 22:54.495
You know, and all types of cats are good, you know.

22:55.035 --> 22:59.618
But I guess our favorite's like a really dense, fluffy, fuzzy cat.

22:59.658 --> 23:03.080
You know, soft fur, but it's got a good amount of fudge to it.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.402
You know, like, round face.

23:05.522 --> 23:06.462
Round face.

23:06.482 --> 23:06.903
Round face.

23:06.963 --> 23:07.703
Grab the cheeks.

23:07.743 --> 23:09.925
Yeah, so the squatters with round ears are really good, too.

23:09.965 --> 23:11.846
But normal cute ears are good, too.

23:11.866 --> 23:12.666
Those are really strong.

23:12.686 --> 23:17.209
But it's nice to, like, put your finger near the ear and make them sort of go, waaah.

23:17.809 --> 23:18.469
I don't like this.

23:18.609 --> 23:19.270
I don't like this.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.410
You're cute though.

23:20.490 --> 23:21.591
I'm gonna do it.

23:21.871 --> 23:23.791
I'm gonna tease you.

23:23.851 --> 23:24.612
I'm gonna go away.

23:24.672 --> 23:25.992
I'm gonna follow you.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.033
Every part of the cat is so good.

23:28.433 --> 23:30.454
The chest, the tummy, the cheeks.

23:30.474 --> 23:32.715
We talked about the mouth, the ears, the ears.

23:32.755 --> 23:33.575
Don't forget the ears.

23:33.615 --> 23:34.336
You know, the back.

23:34.636 --> 23:35.336
The back is good.

23:35.416 --> 23:35.956
The thighs!

23:36.016 --> 23:36.836
The thighs!

23:36.896 --> 23:37.677
The tails, the paws.

23:37.697 --> 23:40.498
You know, the fur in between the fingers.

23:40.518 --> 23:41.598
That's a good chew.

23:44.139 --> 23:45.380
The tail, did I say the tail?

23:45.680 --> 23:46.401
The tail, yeah.

23:46.461 --> 23:46.961
It's all good.

23:47.041 --> 23:52.064
You know, if the tail's kind of hanging off something, you can go and be like, oh, you're a fish, I'm gonna bite it!

23:52.244 --> 23:52.404
Ow!

23:52.564 --> 23:54.225
Ow.

23:54.285 --> 23:56.146
Yeah, it's all good.

23:56.507 --> 23:56.747
Yeah.

23:56.847 --> 23:58.288
In case you didn't know, we don't have a cat.

23:58.388 --> 23:59.028
No, we don't.

23:59.128 --> 23:59.869
We don't have a cat.

24:00.089 --> 24:04.851
But we do have a limit on how much cat media we can consume in a day.

24:04.931 --> 24:05.212
Yeah.

24:05.252 --> 24:06.132
Yeah, we really like cats.

24:06.172 --> 24:07.553
We really, really love cats.

24:07.593 --> 24:08.634
We really love cats.

24:08.714 --> 24:09.814
You get it now!

24:09.874 --> 24:10.895
We really, really like cats.

24:12.815 --> 24:19.557
Please, you know, if you see a cat, if you have a cat, please go play and hug it and kiss it and huff it for us.

24:19.757 --> 24:22.357
The kissing has to be very intense, okay?

24:23.137 --> 24:24.998
Intense, intense.

24:25.138 --> 24:27.458
We just wanted to explain that so you understand.

24:27.498 --> 24:28.238
We really like cats.

24:28.258 --> 24:28.478
Got it?

24:28.498 --> 24:30.459
Thank you, thank you.

24:30.639 --> 24:31.579
Thank you, thank you.

24:31.599 --> 24:32.919
Yes, we really like cats.

24:37.549 --> 24:38.369
Delicious.

24:38.529 --> 24:39.150
Delicious.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.050
Delicious cats.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.551
But we talked about cats now.

24:42.571 --> 24:47.912
Let's go on to our next segment, Doggie of the Day!

24:47.972 --> 24:49.333
A bit of whiplash here.

24:49.413 --> 24:52.174
De-den!

24:52.254 --> 24:55.815
Our doggy of today is Pudding!

24:55.895 --> 24:58.816
And Pudding loves Greek yogurt.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.436
Not pudding, you know it.

25:00.676 --> 25:01.557
Right?

25:01.577 --> 25:02.537
But Pudding loves it so much.

25:02.797 --> 25:03.898
So much!

25:03.918 --> 25:08.923
She gets a bit passionate and pretty expressive about it too.

25:09.383 --> 25:10.884
Cute.

25:10.924 --> 25:12.366
The yogurt on those.

25:13.026 --> 25:17.610
But Moco-chan, you kind of get like this when you're eating something that's extra special you feel passionate about.

25:17.630 --> 25:20.453
You know, like a parfait.

25:20.473 --> 25:23.456
Maybe sometimes, but I think you do too.

25:23.596 --> 25:25.598
I found some food on your face earlier.

25:30.361 --> 25:37.066
But you know, I feel like, well, maybe us, maybe you more in particular, have something in common with pudding, you know?

25:37.607 --> 25:39.768
Even the look in the eyes of pudding, right?

25:40.088 --> 25:40.869
Greek Yogurt!

25:44.071 --> 25:46.993
How does pudding BAU BAU?

25:47.013 --> 25:48.815
Especially like, when eating the Greek Yogurt?

25:50.277 --> 26:01.143
Isn't that a bit difficult?

26:01.383 --> 26:04.565
The only thing in Pudding's heart is Greek Yogurt at that moment.

26:04.785 --> 26:05.586
At that moment!

26:05.646 --> 26:07.767
That's the important part.

26:07.847 --> 26:09.408
It's just Greek Yogurt at that moment.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.009
But after the Greek Yogurt...

26:12.029 --> 26:12.469
It's love.

26:12.789 --> 26:22.593
I was gonna say, I'd say that Pudding's really, you know, Pudding's the best friend that, you know, always has your best interests at heart.

26:23.694 --> 26:27.135
Until, you know, you bring up the Greek yogurt, you don't wanna share.

26:27.175 --> 26:28.156
Yeah, friendship over.

26:28.596 --> 26:29.136
It ends there.

26:31.597 --> 26:32.218
Thank you!

26:32.658 --> 26:36.802
Enjoy the Greek Yogurt Pudding.

26:37.142 --> 26:38.884
It's a good breakfast too, right?

26:38.944 --> 26:41.606
Maybe Ruffians will choose Greek Yogurt for breakfast.

26:41.887 --> 26:42.928
And pudding.

26:43.008 --> 26:43.448
And pudding.

26:43.528 --> 26:44.369
And pudding.

26:44.489 --> 26:45.870
On to the next!

26:46.271 --> 26:48.733
Today I went on a walk.

26:48.993 --> 26:49.393
We have...

26:52.758 --> 26:54.739
Did we go to the ocean?

26:54.799 --> 26:56.279
An ocean sidewalk?

26:57.019 --> 26:58.160
It's so pretty.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.461
It looks so nice and comfortable.

27:00.521 --> 27:02.621
It's probably like a nice breeze.

27:02.661 --> 27:04.682
It kind of smells a bit salty.

27:04.762 --> 27:05.342
A rock?

27:05.883 --> 27:08.424
It's the ocean!

27:08.444 --> 27:09.524
The ocean!

27:09.764 --> 27:12.525
It must have been so relaxing to hear the sounds of the ocean.

27:17.227 --> 27:18.968
This looks pretty rocky though.

27:19.469 --> 27:21.390
I don't know, I feel like the water looks really yummy.

27:21.510 --> 27:23.292
Yummy sea water.

27:23.332 --> 27:25.153
Something you could drink.

27:26.334 --> 27:27.676
It tastes like soda.

27:28.196 --> 27:32.920
I guess you could drink it if you wanted to, Moco-chan, but... I don't take any responsibility.

27:33.280 --> 27:33.661
Maybe.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.043
But you know, do you see?

27:36.063 --> 27:36.703
Ruffians!

27:37.444 --> 27:37.724
There!

27:38.425 --> 27:39.766
There's something on the rocks there!

27:41.124 --> 27:43.485
There's a Sea Puffer!

27:43.645 --> 27:44.446
Sea Puffer!

27:44.526 --> 27:46.927
It's kind of maybe hard to tell them apart, but they're there.

27:46.947 --> 27:47.828
They're really cute looking.

27:47.968 --> 27:49.569
It's kind of chubby, too.

27:49.889 --> 27:55.572
And I don't know if you can see here, but they're kind of making eye contact with the camera, too.

27:55.872 --> 27:56.933
Eye contact.

27:56.973 --> 28:00.395
Maybe they're a little bit curious, just like us.

28:00.555 --> 28:04.978
You know, they're supposed to be tough, but I think I could definitely take one down in a fight.

28:05.618 --> 28:05.838
Really?

28:05.858 --> 28:06.679
They aren't that tough.

28:06.959 --> 28:07.659
Really?

28:07.679 --> 28:10.901
Yeah, so, you know, if one attacks you, I'll protect you.

28:11.381 --> 28:11.722
Thank you!

28:11.762 --> 28:12.082
BAU BAU!

28:12.122 --> 28:14.905
Next we have our Question of the Day.

28:15.045 --> 28:17.227
We answered a lot of questions earlier.

28:17.588 --> 28:19.409
Here's another good question.

28:34.216 --> 28:35.937
And then... Oh!

28:36.098 --> 28:37.158
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

28:37.178 --> 28:38.319
Hello!

28:38.760 --> 28:46.806
My papa is super terrified of thunderstorms, so I was just curious, as Demon Guard Dogs, do you both like thunderstorms?

28:47.046 --> 28:48.667
If not, how do you get through them?

28:48.988 --> 28:50.068
BAU BAU for now.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.269
BAU BAU!

28:51.630 --> 28:52.811
I don't like loud sounds.

28:52.851 --> 28:55.252
Yeah, I understand.

28:55.272 --> 28:56.193
Yeah.

28:56.573 --> 29:00.196
You know, we're scared of a lot of things too, even though we're doing our best.

29:00.356 --> 29:01.197
Yeah.

29:01.717 --> 29:02.038
Yeah.

29:03.063 --> 29:13.392
I kind of mentioned it a bit in the Japanese Zatsudan stream earlier, but Moco-chan, it's kind of hard to do the laundry because the laundry machine makes a very loud sound.

29:13.472 --> 29:17.195
So it's sort of like thunderstorms.

29:17.895 --> 29:25.322
And you know, for us, thunderstorms are a bit scary at first, but as long as we're together, you know?

29:25.402 --> 29:27.984
And once we realize that it's a thunderstorm, it's better.

29:28.164 --> 29:28.965
It's okay, you know?

29:30.555 --> 29:32.156
Thunderstorms are kinda cool too, you know.

29:32.176 --> 29:33.417
Especially if there's lightning.

29:33.677 --> 29:35.178
Yeah, I like looking at the lightning.

29:35.218 --> 29:36.459
I just don't like the loud sounds.

29:36.499 --> 29:37.440
Yeah, the loud sounds.

29:37.460 --> 29:38.320
It's kinda scary.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.322
If all of a sudden it's BAU BAU BAU.

29:40.702 --> 29:41.442
Too surprising.

29:41.582 --> 29:43.584
But yeah, we get it.

29:44.164 --> 29:44.745
Loud things.

29:44.785 --> 29:45.905
Sudden loud sounds.

29:45.945 --> 29:46.085
Yeah.

29:48.064 --> 29:50.346
Thank you Ruffians for the headpats!

29:50.567 --> 29:53.870
Headpats with a paw for two, okay?

29:53.990 --> 30:02.438
I think, you know, when we feel really scared, we just kinda go and curl up under some fluffy and fuzzy blankets too.

30:02.758 --> 30:04.460
You know, we get like a warm heater.

30:05.100 --> 30:08.023
Try to maybe relax the music, darken the room.

30:08.063 --> 30:08.624
Keep it nice.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.346
Yeah, try to get some rest.

30:10.386 --> 30:11.828
Make it comfy.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.951
You know, when you're not feeling good, it's good to take a rest.

30:15.232 --> 30:17.394
Maybe that will help you poop for two!

30:17.674 --> 30:18.055
Maybe.

30:18.315 --> 30:19.356
Good blanket.

30:19.977 --> 30:25.403
But, you know, there's a lot of things we're scared of, but I guess thunderstorms, it's not really one of them.

30:27.142 --> 30:29.704
I think maybe, you know, we're scared of other things.

30:30.204 --> 30:33.667
And maybe your puppy's not scared of other things, you're scared of thunderstorms.

30:33.727 --> 30:37.511
But I think we can both get over it.

30:37.611 --> 30:38.151
Together.

30:39.413 --> 30:43.136
We believe that your puppy can conquer the fear too.

30:43.176 --> 30:44.858
Let's do our best all together, okay?

30:46.679 --> 30:47.459
Thank you!

30:47.519 --> 30:49.040
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

30:49.340 --> 31:01.904
We're also always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, Doggie of the Day, to hear more about your vlogs and quiz questions, so please don't hesitate to submit yours with the hashtag right at the top up there.

31:02.364 --> 31:04.345
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

31:04.365 --> 31:05.325
Thank you!

31:05.926 --> 31:09.487
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

31:09.547 --> 31:11.728
Let's take a peek at what we have coming next.

31:11.748 --> 31:11.928
Dan dan!

31:16.064 --> 31:19.387
We're gonna be playing River City Girls later today.

31:19.647 --> 31:24.351
It's our first time playing any of the Kunio-kun games series.

31:25.772 --> 31:26.573
It's a brawler.

31:27.974 --> 31:28.815
I'm playing.

31:28.975 --> 31:29.455
I'm playing.

31:29.595 --> 31:30.036
I'm playing.

31:30.096 --> 31:30.896
Yeah, it's two players.

31:31.137 --> 31:32.518
Moco-chan's playing.

31:32.658 --> 31:33.138
I'm playing.

31:34.554 --> 31:34.774
Yes.

31:35.074 --> 31:35.355
Yes.

31:36.175 --> 31:38.277
Two player.

31:38.637 --> 31:40.699
I shouldn't need to be backseating today.

31:40.719 --> 31:46.004
You shouldn't need to, but... Do we think that Fuwawa's still gonna backseat today?

31:46.024 --> 31:47.245
Do you?

31:47.265 --> 31:48.306
Cuz... Do you?

31:48.966 --> 31:52.649
I sort of feel like they're still gonna be backseating today.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.231
Yes?

31:55.452 --> 31:56.312
Yes, really.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.314
I have my own controller.

31:58.354 --> 31:58.674
Yes!

31:59.095 --> 32:00.596
There's no no's, it's just...

32:06.063 --> 32:06.483
Of course.

32:06.943 --> 32:08.685
I'll prove you wrong.

32:08.825 --> 32:09.325
Will you?

32:10.606 --> 32:12.428
Ruffians, make sure you watch, okay?

32:12.588 --> 32:14.870
Keep track if she backseats or not.

32:15.210 --> 32:16.611
You have to watch, you know, make sure.

32:16.992 --> 32:18.853
Ah, FUWAMOCO's actually better than Moco-chan.

32:18.873 --> 32:20.695
She's getting more of the enemies.

32:20.715 --> 32:21.956
They won't say that, no.

32:22.216 --> 32:23.277
They'll say that.

32:24.218 --> 32:26.059
But yes, please join us later today!

32:29.067 --> 32:31.028
And for our schedule!

32:31.108 --> 32:31.869
De-den!

32:32.169 --> 32:33.670
We're at the middle of the week.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.392
Almost at the middle of the week.

32:36.692 --> 32:41.235
And tomorrow we're going back to Spooky Shopskill Mansion!

32:41.435 --> 32:42.596
I'm not looking forward to it.

32:43.016 --> 32:44.837
This time, we're gonna beat it!

32:45.018 --> 32:48.220
We're gonna get to the thousandth room.

32:48.260 --> 32:48.680
A thousandth?

32:48.780 --> 32:49.441
A thousandth?

32:49.561 --> 32:51.042
A thousandth room!

32:52.643 --> 32:53.223
No matter what.

32:53.483 --> 32:55.285
Do you think you'll be okay, Ruffians?

32:56.465 --> 32:57.988
Will we be able to do it?

32:58.008 --> 33:03.818
It is getting a little bit scarier every time now, but... It was really scary last time too.

33:03.878 --> 33:04.519
I can do it!

33:04.539 --> 33:05.621
I believe.

33:06.342 --> 33:07.664
No scary emotes.

33:08.185 --> 33:08.285
No.

33:09.807 --> 33:12.690
We'll do our best, the Ruffians will be there to help us, okay?

33:12.710 --> 33:12.790
Yeah.

33:12.810 --> 33:13.831
Okay.

33:14.052 --> 33:16.314
We need your help for it, okay?

33:16.374 --> 33:17.175
Yeah.

33:18.116 --> 33:25.444
And then on Friday we have an Advent collab, but this time mine is Shiori, but we're playing Apex.

33:25.924 --> 33:27.406
Apex.

33:27.726 --> 33:28.227
And I play...

33:28.807 --> 33:30.328
I'm holding the controller.

33:30.448 --> 33:31.528
I'm holding the keyboard.

33:31.608 --> 33:32.309
Holding the keyboard.

33:32.329 --> 33:32.789
Whichever one.

33:32.809 --> 33:33.709
You're gonna hold the keyboard.

33:33.729 --> 33:34.689
I'm gonna hold the keyboard.

33:34.710 --> 33:34.890
Okay.

33:35.130 --> 33:36.410
That's an interesting way to play.

33:38.091 --> 33:43.713
So you'll have to see just how amazing I am at Apex.

33:44.614 --> 33:48.335
It'll be an exciting sight to see Avin Apex.

33:51.081 --> 33:54.783
And then, on the weekend we're going to be playing two Nintendo games.

33:54.803 --> 33:58.105
We're playing The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the first time.

33:58.565 --> 34:00.687
And then back to Donkey Kong Country.

34:00.707 --> 34:01.807
Donkey Kong Country.

34:02.268 --> 34:04.969
Bananas, bananas, bananas, bananas.

34:05.049 --> 34:06.910
Bananas, bananas.

34:08.211 --> 34:11.273
We have a lot of fun things coming up, so Ruffians, we hope that you'll join us.

34:11.853 --> 34:17.617
I feel a bit bad because I realized that maybe, you know, we've been doing a lot of streams.

34:18.437 --> 34:21.200
Maybe it's been a bit tough for Ruffians to catch them all, you know?

34:21.660 --> 34:25.183
We're sorry if we've been making you a bit like, oh, there's not enough time.

34:25.203 --> 34:30.708
But we're really happy that you're here when you can be here with us too.

34:31.289 --> 34:33.310
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

34:33.331 --> 34:34.572
We'll always be waiting here.

34:34.592 --> 34:36.553
We'll come back when you can.

34:36.694 --> 34:37.034
BAU BAU!

34:42.116 --> 34:43.257
Are we already at the time, Moco-chan?

34:43.337 --> 34:44.397
It's that time already.

34:45.898 --> 34:55.782
Well, you know, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to do a shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

34:57.583 --> 34:58.484
Panty!

34:58.504 --> 34:59.205
BAU BAU!

34:59.265 --> 35:00.467
Ransa!

35:00.507 --> 35:01.068
BAU BAU!

35:01.128 --> 35:01.328
Whale!

35:01.549 --> 35:03.011
BAU BAU!

35:03.031 --> 35:03.111
Siri!

35:03.792 --> 35:04.393
BAU BAU!

35:04.713 --> 35:05.053
Eagle!

35:05.093 --> 35:05.935
BAU BAU!

35:06.235 --> 35:06.896
Jayham!

35:07.256 --> 35:08.238
BAU BAU!

35:14.426 --> 35:19.972
And to every other ruffian, we hope you have a howl of a day!

35:20.453 --> 35:22.935
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
