05:22.249 --> 05:26.031

05:26.712 --> 05:29.573
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:29.593 --> 05:32.374

05:39.941 --> 05:40.682
Ruffians!

05:40.722 --> 05:42.864
Did you sleep well?

05:43.305 --> 05:43.825
Good morning!

05:43.885 --> 05:47.789
Thank you for joining us today for our 69th episode!

Yeah!

05:57.736 --> 05:59.077
We're almost at 70!

05:59.177 --> 05:59.758
Almost 70!

06:00.318 --> 06:01.439
BAU BAU!

06:01.940 --> 06:02.581
BAU BAU!

06:03.061 --> 06:13.551
Wow, for ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:13.932 --> 06:14.472

FUWAMOCO!

06:16.194 --> 06:17.135
And it's hosted by us.

06:17.775 --> 06:19.276
FUWAMOCO!

06:36.347 --> 06:37.728
BAU BAU!

06:37.748 --> 06:39.409
Nice BAU BAU!

06:39.769 --> 06:40.629
Are you BAU?

06:40.649 --> 06:41.430
BAU the best!

06:41.790 --> 06:42.951
Almost at 70.

06:43.031 --> 06:43.391
Right?

06:43.451 --> 06:43.811
Right!

06:47.694 --> 06:49.034
We haven't slept in.

06:49.074 --> 06:50.555
We haven't, ruffians!

06:52.275 --> 06:55.536
We haven't slept in!

06:55.577 --> 06:55.837
Right?

06:56.637 --> 06:58.557
BAU BAU!

06:58.577 --> 06:59.798
FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:59.938 --> 07:00.978
Happy morning.

07:01.478 --> 07:02.239
Seems sleepy.

07:02.419 --> 07:05.880
I have a big problem.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.120
What?

07:11.445 --> 07:11.985
Ruffians.

07:12.565 --> 07:16.366
Surely it's too cold and you know Pero's not quite around, right?

07:16.987 --> 07:19.187
He's somewhere warmer.

07:19.888 --> 07:22.708
You know, like in the middle of the earth or something.

07:22.728 --> 07:23.749
The middle of the earth!

07:23.829 --> 07:25.549
Somewhere warm, you know.

07:29.070 --> 07:32.171
There has been another Pero sighting.

07:33.812 --> 07:34.492
Why?

07:34.932 --> 07:35.512
Why?

07:35.532 --> 07:40.314
I think the ruffians just have too sharp eyes.

07:40.374 --> 07:40.994
Sharp eyes, huh?

07:43.058 --> 07:43.639
Wow!

07:44.739 --> 07:46.220
Pero was spotted!

07:46.861 --> 07:48.042
De-den!

07:48.442 --> 07:48.582
Oh!

07:49.183 --> 07:49.343
Oh!

07:50.223 --> 07:51.524
Oh!

07:51.985 --> 07:54.266
You saw Pero on your campus!

07:54.326 --> 07:58.209
But you gave him a scarf and a hat!

08:01.672 --> 08:04.034
You know, that's really kind of you.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.761
Good idea to tea him like that.

08:08.801 --> 08:09.602
Yeah, you know it.

08:11.363 --> 08:14.365
Have you stared into the little black eyes of his before?

08:15.926 --> 08:16.346
Try it.

08:17.347 --> 08:18.467
Ruffian stare.

08:18.708 --> 08:19.008
Do it.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.134
BAU BAU!

08:56.007 --> 08:59.388
Well, you know, he does look very warm, he does.

08:59.408 --> 09:02.769
A bit fluffy and fuzzy even!

09:03.270 --> 09:05.030
Like, like a cute grandma!

09:05.110 --> 09:05.790
I'm pretty sure!

09:05.870 --> 09:08.231
Yeah, he does look like a cute grandma.

09:08.491 --> 09:11.312
Yeah, but don't, don't be fooled by fans, okay?

09:12.033 --> 09:13.493
He's not a grandma.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.814
He's Pero.

09:14.894 --> 09:15.294
Yeah.

09:15.434 --> 09:15.674
Yeah.

09:16.107 --> 09:17.028
He won't be knitting.

09:17.568 --> 09:18.969
He won't be drinking tea.

09:20.229 --> 09:23.271
He's up to nasty stuff, okay?

09:23.311 --> 09:25.152
Guys, he's Pero, okay?

09:26.453 --> 09:28.294
He's not your grandma!

09:28.554 --> 09:30.415
You're being fooled, okay?

09:31.276 --> 09:31.776
No.

09:32.496 --> 09:32.817
No.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.297
You can change him.

09:34.337 --> 09:35.518
No, Pero's Pero.

09:35.598 --> 09:36.879
Pero is nasty.

09:37.698 --> 09:40.081
Yeah, don't fool yourself, okay?

09:40.601 --> 09:45.306
Ruffians, please make sure, be careful if you see him around, okay?

09:45.486 --> 09:50.412
If someone comes up to you and says that they're your grandma, don't believe them.

09:50.432 --> 09:51.913
Don't believe them, okay?

09:52.454 --> 09:53.935
BAU BAU!

09:56.730 --> 09:58.571
I'm a bit concerned about the ruffians.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.733
You're being too kind, ruffians!

10:00.773 --> 10:02.855
You can't be deceived that easily, okay?

10:02.875 --> 10:03.795
Be careful.

10:03.855 --> 10:04.976
You have to be careful.

10:04.996 --> 10:05.897
Avoid eye contact.

10:06.137 --> 10:06.737
Exactly.

10:08.999 --> 10:09.399
Well!

10:10.480 --> 10:11.141
We have some...

10:12.162 --> 10:14.303
Happy New Year!

10:14.883 --> 10:15.903
Ruffians!

10:16.443 --> 10:19.805
Exciting things are going on!

10:19.825 --> 10:33.049
It was just announced that FUWAMOCO will be participating in the hololive X capsule collab for the lantern festival in Tainan!

10:33.129 --> 10:35.249
BAU BAU!

10:35.330 --> 10:37.710
We're so excited!

10:37.930 --> 10:39.471
Look at us, the ruffians!

10:41.110 --> 10:45.433
Together with our senpai!

10:45.693 --> 10:47.554
The club, for a bit more information.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.656
The club will be going on from February 24th.

10:50.676 --> 10:54.038
So about a month from now.

10:54.098 --> 10:57.601
February 24th to March 10th.

10:57.721 --> 11:02.124
There will be a bunch of fun things to check out.

11:02.464 --> 11:05.046
Ruffians will keep on getting more and more surprises.

11:05.106 --> 11:05.206
Oh!

11:05.246 --> 11:05.406
This!

11:05.846 --> 11:06.566
That too!

11:07.727 --> 11:08.968
That too!

11:09.348 --> 11:10.129
Oh my gosh.

11:11.449 --> 11:14.170
It's our first time being invited to something like this.

11:14.310 --> 11:16.231
We're really, really happy!

11:16.551 --> 11:23.113
We can't wait for the event to start, so hopefully you decide to go check out and enjoy the lantern festival with us in Tainan!

11:23.533 --> 11:25.374
BAU BAU!

11:25.534 --> 11:30.895
Thank you, it must be our first time.

11:31.576 --> 11:32.536
BAU BAU!

11:32.616 --> 11:33.576
Got it!

11:35.357 --> 11:35.857
Got it!

11:36.997 --> 11:37.437
Got it.

11:40.209 --> 11:42.831
Well, you might already know.

11:42.851 --> 11:53.417
But, you know, usually, Ruffians, we have a weekly collab with Advent, right?

11:53.457 --> 11:54.658
We do!

11:54.718 --> 11:59.561
But this week, instead of our regular collab, we're doing something really special!

12:00.362 --> 12:05.185
Yeah, we're gonna be having our first ever Advent Karaoke Relay!

12:08.208 --> 12:11.713
It will start at 6PM PT, just like usual.

12:11.854 --> 12:15.278
And we'll all be singing for 30 minutes each.

12:15.338 --> 12:17.161
FUWAMOCO, Shiori, Biboo, Nerissa, then FUWAMOCO!

12:22.671 --> 12:23.112
Yeah.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.073
Ah, but.

12:24.093 --> 12:24.193
But.

12:24.433 --> 12:24.634
But.

12:25.114 --> 12:25.355
Yeah.

12:25.455 --> 12:33.505
This time, you know, we're actually going to be doing an unarchived karaoke at the end to count it off.

12:33.565 --> 12:33.765
Yeah!

12:33.845 --> 12:33.965
Yeah!

12:34.005 --> 12:35.107
This is unarchived.

12:35.147 --> 12:37.450
That means you definitely can't miss it, right?

12:37.750 --> 12:39.112
Right!

12:39.212 --> 12:39.432
Yeah.

12:41.214 --> 12:43.615
Oh boy, I wonder what the other girls will be singing.

12:43.715 --> 12:44.436
Right!

12:44.796 --> 12:49.518
We're not sure if it's going to be archived or unarchived, so you'll definitely need to be there.

12:49.558 --> 12:53.100
You have to be there!

12:53.540 --> 13:01.404
We're really looking forward to all the fun singing that we're going to have and listening to Advent's beautiful singing voices too.

13:01.544 --> 13:02.885
Everybody's so unique.

13:03.285 --> 13:05.987
Let's make sure to prepare our palettes, okay?

13:06.507 --> 13:07.467
Lots of fun.

13:07.508 --> 13:08.528
BAU BAU!

13:12.614 --> 13:17.161
Who is Bijou?

13:17.682 --> 13:18.162
I don't know.

13:18.182 --> 13:21.247
The sparkling gem of Advent.

13:22.208 --> 13:22.589
Biboo.

13:22.649 --> 13:24.852
If Bijou is the sparkling gem of Advent, then...

13:25.862 --> 13:26.403
Who's Biboo?

13:26.443 --> 13:27.063
Biboo Koteki.

13:27.884 --> 13:29.065
Biboo Koteki?

13:29.445 --> 13:30.446
Biboo Koteki.

13:31.908 --> 13:32.348
Got it.

13:32.749 --> 13:34.270
Koteki.

13:34.590 --> 13:36.712
Okay.

13:37.653 --> 13:38.394
That's who it is.

13:38.534 --> 13:39.235
That's who it is.

13:39.295 --> 13:40.156
Biboo Koteki.

13:40.676 --> 13:44.139
Ruffians.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.822
FUWAMOCO Ino.

13:47.362 --> 13:50.826
We actually had something very special happen.

13:52.386 --> 13:58.269
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

14:17.259 --> 14:29.430
The other day, one of FUWAMOCO Morning's idols, Naruse Eimi, Eitaso!

14:30.151 --> 14:35.876
She was a member of Dempagumi Inc., an idol group that we really, really liked!

14:35.896 --> 14:37.978
Definitely one of our favorites.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.099
She tweeted,

14:40.322 --> 14:40.762
BAU BAU!

14:41.143 --> 14:41.583
BAU BAU!

14:41.603 --> 14:41.984
BAU BAU!

14:57.257 --> 14:59.459
I feel really really happy!

14:59.899 --> 15:02.420
But a bit embarrassed too!

15:02.801 --> 15:11.026
She was my favorite member back when she was a part of the group and actually I still think about her a lot.

15:11.747 --> 15:11.947
BAU!

15:11.967 --> 15:12.068
BAU!

15:12.408 --> 15:12.488
BAU!

15:31.963 --> 15:36.805
You know, she always wanted to be a bright source of light for everyone.

15:36.885 --> 15:38.985
Kind of like the sun, you know?

15:39.625 --> 15:42.186
And she absolutely did that.

15:42.206 --> 15:42.866
You know, Dempagumi...

15:43.206 --> 15:48.388
They always said that their rival was in another idol group, but actually pretty cute!

15:48.508 --> 15:53.249
And actually, Eitaso even became the seiyu for PreCure Star!

15:53.669 --> 15:55.370
Elite Star Twinkle PreCure.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.110
Yeah!

15:57.045 --> 15:57.685
BAU BAU.

16:25.040 --> 16:30.764
Actually, you know, Icomochi-mama is also a really big fan of Denpagumi, too.

16:31.265 --> 16:31.645
Right!

16:32.385 --> 16:35.748
We can't wait to chat with Icomochi-mama about Denpagumi stuff, too.

16:35.848 --> 16:40.931
Yeah, you know, we could talk for a very, very, very long time.

16:41.152 --> 16:46.475
But hopefully we can sing more Denpagumi songs at our rock n' rawr parties, too.

16:46.535 --> 16:46.736
Right.

16:47.156 --> 16:47.716
BAU BAU!

16:48.817 --> 16:49.498
FUWAMOCO!

17:04.381 --> 17:06.762
Ruffians!

17:07.863 --> 17:22.391
Yesterday there was a lot going on, but actually, Ichijo Ririka of ReGLOSS, she had a stream where she learned some English phrases, some words from us hololive English members!

17:22.771 --> 17:23.652
Did you check it out?

17:23.732 --> 17:26.894
It was really silly and cute to see her do her best,

17:31.136 --> 17:33.698
Rai tried to learn as much as she can.

17:33.838 --> 17:38.801
I don't know if we're a really good example, but... Well... We're something.

17:39.261 --> 17:40.822
Yeah, we shared the line.

17:41.423 --> 17:45.185
You know, have a howl of a day!

17:45.265 --> 17:52.690
But... That aside, for some reason, Ririka... She says she wants to become a sandwich with us.

17:54.591 --> 17:54.951
Huh?

17:55.272 --> 17:55.792
A sandwich?

17:56.733 --> 18:00.415
That doesn't have to do anything with our... Our line.

18:01.673 --> 18:02.313
We're not.

18:02.594 --> 18:03.814
Not have a sandwich!

18:03.974 --> 18:04.234
No!

18:04.254 --> 18:05.455
Not have a sandwich today!

18:05.475 --> 18:06.276
We're not food!

18:06.696 --> 18:07.696
We're demon dogs!

18:07.736 --> 18:08.377
Yeah!

18:08.957 --> 18:09.897
Ruffy and fuzzy!

18:09.958 --> 18:10.138
Yeah!

18:10.198 --> 18:10.838
Not food!

18:10.898 --> 18:11.578
Not a sandwich!

18:11.598 --> 18:14.840
I don't think you want your food very fluffy or fuzzy, huh?

18:14.960 --> 18:15.521
No.

18:15.641 --> 18:16.961
No fluffy fuzzy sandwiches.

18:17.021 --> 18:17.362
No.

18:17.682 --> 18:17.982
No.

18:18.042 --> 18:18.302
No.

18:18.822 --> 18:25.386
That's what I thought, but it seems, ruffians, that there was a lot of other viewers that felt the same in the chat, too.

18:25.426 --> 18:25.766
Huh.

18:27.187 --> 18:27.527
Why?

18:28.808 --> 18:29.028
Why?

18:29.048 --> 18:31.029
We're not food, you know that, right?

18:32.518 --> 18:33.959
I'm not a hot dog!

18:33.999 --> 18:34.459
No!

18:34.840 --> 18:35.180
No.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.140
Hot dog?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.062
That's more like Korone-senpai.

18:39.182 --> 18:44.925
Wait, which hololive- We're saying we're not food, but we're saying that Korone-senpai could be food.

18:45.185 --> 18:48.466
Could be food.

18:50.307 --> 18:50.607
Wait.

18:51.728 --> 18:55.070
Which hololive member is best suited for consumption then?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.852
I thought you said Mikocchi-senpai, right?

18:59.312 --> 19:01.113
Ah, but that's Mikocchi-senpai the cookie.

19:05.356 --> 19:06.997
Watame-senpai!

19:07.017 --> 19:09.418
Probably.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.998
There's no excitement in that.

19:12.759 --> 19:13.460
Why?!

19:15.300 --> 19:16.721
Subaru-senpai!

19:16.741 --> 19:20.463
I like Subaru-senpai as an ice cream cone.

19:21.103 --> 19:21.623
Why?

19:23.244 --> 19:24.464
Luna-senpai!

19:24.484 --> 19:26.625
Luna-senpai could be hard to join.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.312
Yeah, Kiara-senpai, there's no excitement in that either.

19:34.012 --> 19:36.874
Oh, Ame-senpai, because she's a little Ame.

19:37.215 --> 19:39.837
Ame.

19:41.218 --> 19:43.840
Okayu-senpai, of course!

19:44.400 --> 19:47.783
I would like a warm bowl of Okayu-senpai!

19:47.843 --> 19:48.383
Thank you!

19:49.822 --> 19:50.723
Okay.

19:51.324 --> 19:51.904
Decided.

19:52.064 --> 19:55.628
That took too long, huh?

19:56.208 --> 20:02.634
Ruffians, we might not keep your tummy full, but maybe not like a nice bowl of okaeshi soba.

20:02.694 --> 20:04.276
But we can keep you warm!

20:05.096 --> 20:06.938
Let's all feel fuzzy.

20:07.879 --> 20:10.661
Maybe we can also keep your heart full, too.

20:11.022 --> 20:11.823
But not your tummy.

20:12.563 --> 20:17.467
But we hope that Ririka continues to do her best getting English.

20:18.347 --> 20:22.010
We'll do our best to improve our Japanese too.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.352
BAU BAU!

20:24.932 --> 20:26.533
Mogumogu kaiyo.

20:28.555 --> 20:31.977
BAU BAU!

20:32.618 --> 20:33.739
Ruffians.

20:37.461 --> 20:39.543
Did you get a good sleep last night?

20:41.761 --> 20:43.822
Rest those eyes, rest those paws.

20:44.382 --> 20:46.624
Go zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

20:47.164 --> 20:47.644
Bijou.

20:48.345 --> 20:48.865
Meow!

20:49.265 --> 20:50.466
You too, thankfully!

20:50.766 --> 20:51.406
Not really.

20:55.989 --> 20:56.889
Moco-chan!

20:57.650 --> 20:59.210
You have something to say, maybe?

21:14.173 --> 21:14.593
Moco-chan.

21:17.334 --> 21:18.034
Ruffians.

21:19.974 --> 21:20.954
I'm sorry!

21:23.575 --> 21:25.775
Last night!

21:26.375 --> 21:28.816
During my climb on Watchalong.

21:28.836 --> 21:32.997
I got pretty sleepy there, huh?

21:34.017 --> 21:35.117
Pretty early on.

21:38.118 --> 21:38.798
I started...

21:42.608 --> 21:49.330
You know, I was doing my best, but I started to do it off here and there, huh?

21:51.970 --> 21:52.130
Yeah.

21:52.370 --> 21:56.531
I definitely did not sleep talk about castles, you know what I mean?

21:56.611 --> 21:56.971
No!

21:57.431 --> 21:59.132
Definitely no sleep talking!

21:59.212 --> 22:00.932
Definitely not, yeah.

22:02.833 --> 22:03.873
Dangerous.

22:05.467 --> 22:09.048
But it wasn't because I wasn't interested or it was slow or anything.

22:09.068 --> 22:09.108
No.

22:09.128 --> 22:16.711
I like this sort of stuff, you know, but... I was just so sleepy.

22:16.791 --> 22:19.012
Yeah, it was a busy day, you know.

22:19.112 --> 22:19.472
Yeah.

22:20.432 --> 22:28.955
And then... It was sad and then... I didn't cry or anything!

22:28.975 --> 22:32.176
My eyes definitely are not puffy!

22:32.196 --> 22:32.276
No!

22:35.066 --> 22:40.947
One moment Moco-chan sleeping next to you, and next moment there's tears streaming down her face?

22:41.007 --> 22:41.267
No.

22:42.148 --> 22:42.528
No.

22:44.768 --> 22:51.369
Well, I'm hoping that tonight, maybe, we'll be a bit more energetic.

22:52.510 --> 22:52.970
Maybe.

22:52.990 --> 22:53.070
Okay!

22:53.090 --> 22:57.711
Because you know we have our second half of the watch along tonight.

22:57.731 --> 22:57.851
Yeah.

22:59.702 --> 23:00.702
More energy!

23:00.842 --> 23:01.303
Why?

23:01.723 --> 23:02.043
Why?

23:02.343 --> 23:03.823
You didn't sleep?

23:04.604 --> 23:06.444
Ah, you didn't!

23:06.464 --> 23:06.844
You didn't!

23:06.984 --> 23:11.806
Ah, I... But you did sleep.

23:11.926 --> 23:16.527
I wonder what that means.

23:16.827 --> 23:16.987
Why?

23:17.007 --> 23:17.828
Why sleepy?

23:17.888 --> 23:18.868
Bring a pillow!

23:19.288 --> 23:21.349
Why?

23:22.309 --> 23:24.710
Actually, Moco-chan.

23:25.610 --> 23:27.631
I also need to confess to you.

23:28.211 --> 23:28.611
What now?

23:31.326 --> 23:31.906
What now?

23:34.067 --> 23:34.487
Why?

23:37.368 --> 23:39.809
I was really, really sleepy too!

23:40.370 --> 23:42.491
Really, really!

23:42.531 --> 23:48.073
Yeah, but I know you know that I need to be strong since I'm the oldest sister, you know?

23:48.573 --> 23:51.814
Yeah, so that's why I let you doze off.

23:52.495 --> 23:55.016
Because I wanted to too.

23:56.336 --> 23:57.176
But I didn't!

23:57.196 --> 23:58.257
I did!

23:58.377 --> 23:59.497
Okay!

23:59.617 --> 24:00.458
Ruffians!

24:01.423 --> 24:02.043
Are you proud?

24:02.063 --> 24:04.284
Are you proud?

24:04.304 --> 24:06.545
Are you proud of me?

24:06.885 --> 24:08.065
I'm not proud of you.

24:08.145 --> 24:11.286
Be proud of me too!

24:11.666 --> 24:15.247
I didn't steal Moco-chan's energy.

24:15.487 --> 24:16.687
I was doing my best.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.408
I stole my energy.

24:18.868 --> 24:20.589
BAU BAU!

24:21.009 --> 24:22.329
Thank you, ruffians!

24:25.350 --> 24:35.573
Well, you know, Kano is a really great, classic, legendary anime, so we'd really like it if you continue watching it along with us!

24:35.613 --> 24:43.014
We just finished off Mocoto's storyline, so I think, you know, if you jump in with us right now, it'll be fine too!

24:43.675 --> 24:53.217
Maybe, you know, we'll also have a summary for those who weren't there, or for those who dozed off like me a bit.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.485
Doing the first part of it!

24:55.546 --> 24:55.966
Yeah.

24:56.306 --> 24:57.626
So it's okay!

24:57.666 --> 24:57.886
Okay.

24:57.926 --> 24:58.286
BAU BAU!

24:58.326 --> 25:06.109
Moco-chan, you'll do better today, right?

25:06.149 --> 25:06.589
I'll do my best.

25:06.609 --> 25:06.869
BAU BAU!

25:15.411 --> 25:16.332
Ruffians!

25:16.792 --> 25:19.573
Does this count as another confession?

25:23.254 --> 25:25.414
Something funny is happening, ruffians.

25:25.875 --> 25:31.516
You know, the other day, we kinda stumbled upon something strange.

25:32.897 --> 25:35.277
Ruffians, have you noticed something?

25:35.297 --> 25:39.979
Have you noticed a greeting?

25:41.994 --> 25:45.716
There's something very unnecessary.

25:46.356 --> 25:48.958
Something that shouldn't be included in it.

25:49.458 --> 25:49.838
Yeah.

25:50.859 --> 25:51.899
We're a bit shocked.

25:52.199 --> 25:53.160
Yeah.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.522
You know, even a little disturbed.

25:57.542 --> 26:09.948
You know, I thought, wow, that's not the kind of thing I want to be sharing, but, well, it's been every stream we've done.

26:13.339 --> 26:16.661
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

26:55.913 --> 26:58.055
Do you see?

26:58.515 --> 26:59.456
See?

26:59.636 --> 27:03.660
I'm serious!

27:03.960 --> 27:11.267
There's a hidden air horn in our meeting this entire time!

27:11.647 --> 27:14.710
It's the air horn!

27:19.480 --> 27:21.581
I can't believe it, Ruffians!

27:22.001 --> 27:24.362
We're really, really sorry!

27:24.962 --> 27:28.904
We didn't mean to be blasting the air horn at you every time!

27:29.024 --> 27:30.325
But now it's too late!

27:30.365 --> 27:31.385
We can't go back!

27:31.405 --> 27:39.788
FUWAMOCO Air Horn.

27:41.420 --> 27:42.521
Sorry, ruffians.

27:42.881 --> 27:45.362
Now you're gonna hear it every time!

27:45.402 --> 27:49.344
You get used to it!

27:49.904 --> 27:53.366
Well, hopefully, you'll learn to love our horns.

27:53.786 --> 27:54.507
Right?

27:55.187 --> 27:55.627
Yeah.

27:56.248 --> 27:58.249
BAU BAU!

27:58.909 --> 27:59.309
Yeah.

27:59.649 --> 28:01.190
That's all we can hope for now, right?

28:01.270 --> 28:02.291
Cuz we can't change things.

28:02.331 --> 28:03.291
We can't change it!

28:03.331 --> 28:04.752
You just have to love it now, huh?

28:04.772 --> 28:06.853
Yeah.

28:07.713 --> 28:10.215
Well, ruffians, are you awake?

28:11.522 --> 28:12.843
Are you feeling good now?

28:13.163 --> 28:20.325
Now that you heard the air horn!

28:20.425 --> 28:21.046
I guess.

28:23.487 --> 28:24.187
Maybe.

28:25.247 --> 28:26.568
You wanna hear from me?

28:27.368 --> 28:28.469
Air horn's not good enough?

28:29.949 --> 28:31.190
What do you think, ruffians?

28:31.550 --> 28:32.930
Air horn good enough?

28:35.111 --> 28:35.251
Ha!

28:39.947 --> 28:40.847
Ah, it's good now.

28:41.188 --> 28:41.768
You don't want?

28:41.868 --> 28:42.168
Okay.

28:43.530 --> 28:43.850
Okay.

28:45.651 --> 28:46.832
Doggie of the Day time.

28:46.913 --> 28:49.735
BAU!

28:50.115 --> 28:55.620
Today's Doggie of the Day is... That.

28:55.940 --> 28:56.181
No!

28:56.321 --> 28:56.561
No!

28:56.701 --> 28:56.921
No!

28:57.902 --> 28:58.703
No!

28:58.743 --> 28:59.103
No!

28:59.123 --> 28:59.844
Okay.

29:08.641 --> 29:11.763
I guess it's that time then.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.166
Ruffians!

29:20.288 --> 29:22.149
It's that day of the week.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.370
It's today!

29:25.010 --> 29:31.794
Today you're gonna listen up close because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

29:32.415 --> 29:36.297
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

29:43.118 --> 29:43.679
Hey!

29:48.223 --> 29:50.104
Are your eyes feeling a bit heavy?

29:53.047 --> 29:56.990
Has the cold been keeping you from getting going a bit?

29:58.932 --> 30:01.814
Have you been telling yourself, just five more minutes?

30:02.775 --> 30:05.137
A little more often than usual recently.

30:07.219 --> 30:08.220
No way!

30:08.900 --> 30:09.160
Okay.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.821
Don't blame yourself for something that's normal, ruffians, okay?

30:13.841 --> 30:14.361
It's dark.

30:14.921 --> 30:15.581
It's chilly.

30:16.101 --> 30:19.582
It makes sense for you to want to take some extra time to rest a bit.

30:20.782 --> 30:24.003
And you know, you should never blame yourself for needing some rest.

30:25.283 --> 30:26.204
You need to think that.

30:26.664 --> 30:30.025
Rest is a very important part of being ready for what brings you.

30:30.045 --> 30:30.105
Huh.

30:32.505 --> 30:33.005
Okay.

30:34.026 --> 30:35.846
It's not good to be constantly staying up.

30:37.093 --> 30:43.500
Sleep is important, you know, so that you can face the difficulties both physically and emotionally.

30:44.861 --> 30:58.715
So if sometimes you feel like you need a bit of a rest, you're feeling a bit bad or like you can't deal with something, maybe the best thing is to take a nap and just refresh a bit.

31:00.037 --> 31:04.319
I know balance is important, and sleep is a big part of it.

31:04.980 --> 31:07.381
So, be kind to yourself, okay?

31:08.062 --> 31:14.605
By giving yourself what you need, a balance of hard work, rest, and relaxation, okay?

31:16.126 --> 31:19.568
If you feel overwhelmed, just remember, okay?

31:20.489 --> 31:21.969
I want you to be nice to yourself.

31:22.610 --> 31:23.030
Got it?

31:24.111 --> 31:24.891
Be nice!

31:25.852 --> 31:28.173
Or, I'll bite you, okay?

31:29.602 --> 31:30.564
You wouldn't want that.

31:32.428 --> 31:32.809
So!

31:33.530 --> 31:35.694
Let's all do our best for the rest of the week, okay?

31:35.714 --> 31:37.157
Ganbatte ne!

31:37.197 --> 31:37.598
BAU BAU!

31:43.707 --> 31:46.708
BAU BAU!

31:47.228 --> 31:49.369
You're gonna do your best today, FUWAMOCO!

31:49.409 --> 31:51.870
Ganbatte!

31:52.410 --> 31:54.691
BAU BAU!

31:54.791 --> 31:56.752
BAU BAU!

31:56.872 --> 32:00.133
Next, we'll check out who's the Doggie of the Day today.

32:00.173 --> 32:03.735
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Dan!

32:04.155 --> 32:05.015
It's Cooper!

32:05.075 --> 32:06.616
Cooper.

32:10.270 --> 32:10.610
Tiny.

32:10.710 --> 32:11.651
Tiny.

32:12.291 --> 32:12.851
Yeah.

32:13.371 --> 32:20.714
But you know, even though Cooper is a little tiny, Cooper brings a big smile to your face too.

32:21.414 --> 32:22.575
And you know what?

32:22.715 --> 32:25.436
That's what he loves to do.

32:26.556 --> 32:27.717
A dog with this like us.

32:28.217 --> 32:29.197
FUWAMOCO-chan!

32:29.397 --> 32:30.678
We're the same!

32:30.918 --> 32:32.719
BAU BAU!

32:33.399 --> 32:34.919
How does Cooper BAU BAU?

32:36.140 --> 32:36.840
BAU BAU.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.260
BAU BAU.

32:39.662 --> 33:07.680
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

33:11.802 --> 33:15.964
Don't let Cooper's tiny toes fool you, okay?

33:16.364 --> 33:22.588
He's just a walkin', barkin', smilin' machine!

33:22.668 --> 33:26.230
He's a good boy and he's ruffians his entire world too.

33:28.487 --> 33:31.790
Yeah, he just wants to make you happy.

33:31.870 --> 33:34.292
So, that's what he's going to do!

33:34.372 --> 33:35.933
He's gonna do it!

33:35.953 --> 33:38.675
Especially with that little pink tongue there.

33:38.695 --> 33:40.997
And that little chocolatey nose.

33:41.258 --> 33:45.021
BAU BAU!

33:46.402 --> 33:52.026
And next for our today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

33:52.046 --> 33:52.226
Slug!

33:57.707 --> 33:58.779
All the snow.

34:00.709 --> 34:01.209
BAU BAU!

34:31.790 --> 34:37.194
And today for our question of the day, we have De-den!

34:37.454 --> 34:38.154
Hi FUWAMOCO!

34:38.214 --> 34:47.921
There are some silly facts about different holomens about stuff they can't do, like how monsters they can't skip or sweets they can't whistle.

34:48.342 --> 34:51.444
I was curious, are there any little things you two can't do?

34:54.803 --> 34:56.084
This is a good one.

34:56.784 --> 34:59.166
There are lots of things we can't do, right?

34:59.186 --> 35:00.867
Try not to poke yourself in the eye.

35:00.927 --> 35:03.009
Yeah, but I can't eat natto.

35:04.290 --> 35:04.730
I am.

35:05.031 --> 35:07.112
Slowly but surely, I can't eat cake.

35:07.152 --> 35:08.213
Right, right.

35:08.233 --> 35:09.494
If you look at it, right?

35:09.534 --> 35:11.396
But we can't touch our toes.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.737
We can't do whistle morsels.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.560
Moco-chan, you can't buzz your lips.

35:17.681 --> 35:18.561
Like warming up?

35:18.681 --> 35:18.942
Yeah.

35:22.346 --> 35:23.887
I can't do that.

35:24.307 --> 35:28.488
Poruru-oneechan was laughing at you.

35:29.029 --> 35:31.850
We can't open our eyes underwater.

35:31.950 --> 35:34.030
But I can doggy paddle.

35:34.651 --> 35:35.491
That's all I can do.

35:35.511 --> 35:37.271
I can doggy paddle!

35:37.291 --> 35:39.472
I don't know, maybe that's it.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.314
It's kinda hard to think of, you know?

35:43.334 --> 35:44.815
You don't think about those things.

35:45.295 --> 35:45.675
Why?

35:45.715 --> 35:46.476
To forget them.

35:47.116 --> 35:47.477
Yeah.

35:48.297 --> 35:52.680
We like to be able to think of the positive things, but you know, we can't skip!

35:52.980 --> 35:53.260
Yeah!

35:53.340 --> 35:55.221
We can definitely whistle!

35:55.701 --> 35:56.082
Yeah.

35:56.602 --> 36:03.186
You know, but even though there might be some things you can't do, it's just a temporary count, right?

36:03.206 --> 36:03.926
Yeah!

36:04.086 --> 36:07.889
If you just practice and work at it, then I think you definitely can, right?

36:07.929 --> 36:09.309
Just like a natto, right?

36:09.550 --> 36:09.710
Yeah.

36:10.717 --> 36:13.899
So ruffians, don't forget about that either, okay?

36:15.079 --> 36:16.860
BAU BAU!

36:16.880 --> 36:19.162
Thank you for such a good question!

36:19.182 --> 36:22.863
Thank you ruffians always for all your submissions!

36:22.924 --> 36:24.384
Your Doggie of the Day!

36:24.444 --> 36:25.205
BAU BAU!

36:25.825 --> 36:28.666
Your questions, your Pero Sightings.

36:28.686 --> 36:34.607
I really hope that Pero doesn't cross paths with you, but it sure seems like that's been common recently.

36:35.107 --> 36:38.588
And also, the brand new FUWAMOCO Scoop!

36:39.208 --> 36:41.269
Thank you so much, ruffians!

36:42.069 --> 36:43.830
Don't forget to use the hashtag!

36:44.070 --> 36:46.310
Hashtag FWMCMorning!

36:46.650 --> 36:49.951
And also for your FUWAMOCO Scoop, hashtag FWMCScoop.

36:49.991 --> 36:50.331
BAU BAU!

36:54.589 --> 36:58.073
As for our next stream, we have tonight.

36:58.534 --> 37:04.160
We're going to be watching the last half of the TV anime Kanon.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.683
Yesterday, as you kind of know, we watched episode 1 to 12.

37:06.783 --> 37:10.247
There was a moment where we laughed.

37:10.657 --> 37:10.837
BAU BAU!

37:28.175 --> 37:28.535
No pillows.

37:28.855 --> 37:29.496
BAU BAU!

37:29.576 --> 37:33.797
And for our schedule!

37:33.897 --> 37:36.058
Let's take a look at the schedule.

37:36.078 --> 37:39.379
On Thursday we're going to be playing Power Up.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.500
It's a brand new game right now.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.641
Early access, we're going to be playing it.

37:43.901 --> 37:49.824
But not just FUWAMOCO, we're going to be playing it together with both Biboo and Shiori!

37:50.084 --> 37:53.145
We're going to check it out all for the first time together.

37:53.165 --> 37:54.986
It looks very fun.

37:55.266 --> 37:56.006
Very silly.

37:56.616 --> 37:57.998
Very silly song.

37:58.358 --> 38:00.480
We hope that you'll check it out together with us.

38:00.540 --> 38:03.323
I kind of have a good feeling about it, right?

38:03.584 --> 38:04.344
It's very silly.

38:04.364 --> 38:05.385
We're silly.

38:05.606 --> 38:08.329
Together everything's fun with Biboo and Shiori, so...

38:09.062 --> 38:10.342
Well, we'll see how it is.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.003
BAU BAU!

38:13.503 --> 38:15.564
Thank you so much, Ruffians.

38:15.664 --> 38:20.125
Thank you for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

38:20.406 --> 38:23.426
I can't believe next episode will be episode 7.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.387
Thank you always.

38:26.207 --> 38:33.650
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special Ruffians today.
