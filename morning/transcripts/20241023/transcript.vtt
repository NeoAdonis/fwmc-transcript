00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.125
Hello BAU BAU!

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:13.728
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:20.394
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:24.557
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:25.097 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.222
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:33.184
Moco-chan.

00:05:36.384 --> 00:05:39.406
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:44.628
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 136th episode!

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:48.090
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.972
I was thinking maybe you won't get it right.

00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:53.392
136th... BAU BAU!

00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:59.815
I was joking to Moco-chan how it's our 5,000th episode today.

00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:07.508
BAU BAU!

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.669
But it is Wednesday.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.670
BAU BAU!

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.831
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today!

00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.851
It's too early!

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:20.873
Too early for 5000, not for Wednesday.

00:06:20.973 --> 00:06:21.773
I get it now.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:28.300
The week does go fast, but I will be seeing some new Ruffians here today!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:39.833
And wow, for those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:40.594
A.K.A.

00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:41.675
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:42.356
Hosted by us!

00:06:43.657 --> 00:06:44.718
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:51.563
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:57.026
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:57.106 --> 00:07:02.150
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO morning!

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.212
BAU BAU!

00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:10.736
I see you know some Ruffians say, oh there's always new Ruffians huh?

00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:16.815
This is Ruffians!

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:19.477
We see you!

00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:20.437
Ruffians!

00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:24.220
We see the silly things you say!

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.662
The hour before FUWAMOCO Morning starts!

00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:29.083
I'll be back, Ruffians!

00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:30.343
I'm gonna go watch this!

00:07:30.603 --> 00:07:33.245
I'm gonna go do that!

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:34.286
Alright!

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:39.448
We see lots of movies, you know!

00:07:39.508 --> 00:07:43.430
Today's my first time watching FUWAMOCO live, you know!

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.191
So it makes us happy to see you, Ruffians!

00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:51.674
And of course, Ruffians are always where we recognize you, you know!

00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:52.954
Of course!

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.415
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:56.516
Thank you!

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.217
But you know, it's the middle of the week already!

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:03.799
That means the week's almost over, really, if you just kind of look at it a different way, right?

00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:04.720
October's over.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:12.150
But it hasn't gotten to the most exciting part of the month.

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:15.334
Pumpkin.

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:15.995
Pumpkin.

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:17.777
Pumpkin.

00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:19.479
Leaves changing colors.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:19.900
Pumpkin.

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:23.123
Apple cider.

00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:25.838
Maybe it has already though.

00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:27.818
Maybe we just don't know how.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:28.859
Maybe.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:33.321
But it's still not quite the spookiest time.

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.041
That's good.

00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:35.402
BAU BAU!

00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:42.445
You've been having lots of fun during October so far, Ruffians!

00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:43.085
And now!

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:46.106
More fun!

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:49.147
It's time for disappointment.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.508
Why is it always disappointment, Moco-chan?

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:52.909
Cause...

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:55.277
Natural.

00:08:57.418 --> 00:08:58.318
Pero Sighting.

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:02.940
Okay.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:03.800
Okay.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.761
Where was Pero Sighted and now Ruffian?

00:09:09.762 --> 00:09:12.763
I feel like the Ruffians don't look that disappointed anymore.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.902
It's okay if they're not disappointed for a Pero Sighting.

00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:22.406
Well, let's show them what disappointment really looks like then.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:23.847
Let's show them!

00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:27.409
Where is Pero Sighting now, Moco-chan?

00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:30.012
De-den!

00:09:31.012 --> 00:09:31.152
Oh!

00:09:31.853 --> 00:09:32.213
Hi!

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:34.555
Did we get confused?

00:09:35.115 --> 00:09:36.336
Did we skip my turn?

00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:38.018
Today I went on a walk!

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.219
Uh... Hi!

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:40.540
No!

00:09:42.607 --> 00:09:44.048
This is a Pero Sighting.

00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:46.189
It's disappointing, you know.

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:47.609
Don't you see that?

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.230
Ah!

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.330
See Pero!

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.231
Pero is hiding there!

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:53.272
Right in the ice cream!

00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:57.074
Right by the Mococo- In the Mococo drink!

00:09:57.234 --> 00:09:57.674
Right!

00:09:57.734 --> 00:10:00.215
Why is Pero doing in the Mococo drink?

00:10:00.255 --> 00:10:02.216
Come on!

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:04.737
Right, that's what I was wondering, you know.

00:10:04.857 --> 00:10:06.458
It's not a very good place.

00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:08.459
Right, Ruffians?

00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:11.200
Hiding in the ice cream.

00:10:13.014 --> 00:10:20.100
I mean, I guess it is a drink, but Ruffians, if you have ice cream in your drink, do you eat the ice cream first or drink the drink first?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:20.861
Ice cream first.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:26.525
Because if you drink all the drink, then you're just left with ice cream on ice.

00:10:27.006 --> 00:10:27.306
Yeah.

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:29.147
Why?

00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:32.310
Ice cream first, ice cream first, ice cream first.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:35.012
Common sense is ice cream first.

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:35.353
Mix it up!

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:44.210
Do you have ice cream left on the ice?

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.331
Well, I don't know though.

00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:51.232
I was wondering, how did Pero get in there?

00:10:51.392 --> 00:10:53.993
I don't think that's on the ingredients list, right?

00:10:56.214 --> 00:10:57.334
It's a bit weird, huh?

00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:06.109
You know, maybe I need to go to Round1 and investigate what's going on there, Ruffians.

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.431
Yeah, I know.

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:13.497
You'll just have to go and see how much fun is happening there.

00:11:13.537 --> 00:11:15.399
Check that maybe Pero isn't around.

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:15.619
Right!

00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:21.044
Right!

00:11:21.104 --> 00:11:23.806
Not just because we want you to go to Round1, right?

00:11:23.886 --> 00:11:24.727
No, definitely.

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:26.528
We're definitely not envious.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.129
Yeah.

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:27.529
No.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.531
No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:30.251
Look!

00:11:30.632 --> 00:11:31.793
Look, there's some of me!

00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:36.376
You know, they got a forgettable Pero, but they got a FUWAMOCO coaster!

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.017
Yeah, right!

00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:39.819
And a drink, too!

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.360
And a little bit extra.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.101
Something nasty extra.

00:11:43.682 --> 00:11:44.943
Not a hair, but worse.

00:11:45.263 --> 00:11:46.664
I'm not envious about that.

00:11:46.704 --> 00:11:47.385
The other stuff...

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:48.546
Maybe.

00:11:48.746 --> 00:11:49.387
Yeah.

00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:51.409
You're a bit envious of Pero.

00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:54.533
Don't need to be envious of Pero.

00:11:54.573 --> 00:11:55.734
You're better than him.

00:11:55.874 --> 00:11:56.796
Better than Pero.

00:11:56.836 --> 00:11:57.176
Morning!

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:57.897
BAU BAU!

00:11:58.157 --> 00:11:58.398
MAMA!

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:02.983
Perotis, I don't wanna find that out.

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:04.565
You're gonna have to find that out.

00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:18.127
The next stop of the FUWAMOCO unofficial world tour has been announced!

00:12:18.147 --> 00:12:22.490
We have just announced as guests at Anime Frontier in Texas!

00:12:30.796 --> 00:12:31.577
America!

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.519
America!

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:36.423
The middle.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:52.177
America yo!

00:12:52.457 --> 00:12:54.057
BAU BAU!

00:12:54.117 --> 00:12:56.378
We're so happy and so excited!

00:12:56.698 --> 00:13:01.099
We're gonna be able to see some more videos soon!

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.921
Even though I say soon, well, soon's kinda soon.

00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:08.942
We'll be at Anime Frontier on December 7th!

00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:09.722
Saturday!

00:13:11.803 --> 00:13:19.666
And I really hope that there'll be lots and lots of Ruffians there to see us and, you know, BAU BAU up a storm with us too!

00:13:20.286 --> 00:13:23.107
A little bit over a month, right?

00:13:24.067 --> 00:13:26.488
Just look at October, it's soon, okay?

00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:29.350
It's soon, it's really soon.

00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:35.477
But you know, we always get a little nervous before big events like this.

00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:43.205
We really hope that you'll come cheer us on and you'll show just how big a Ruffian you are!

00:13:43.726 --> 00:13:44.787
I'm a Ruffian!

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:46.249
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:50.739
What do they say?

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:51.400
What do they say?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.661
What do they say?

00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:56.223
That's the Japanese dub, right?

00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:58.024
I'm a big ol' Ruffian here.

00:13:58.084 --> 00:13:58.824
That's it.

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:01.826
That's the Texas accent, okay.

00:14:19.048 --> 00:14:20.149
BAU BAU!

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:22.831
We have to find Ruffians!

00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:28.935
You have to teach us their anime frontier, okay?

00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:31.677
Please bring your friends too, Ruffians!

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:32.618
Okay!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.060
BAU BAU!

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.322
I'm so excited!

00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:42.064
Another part of the FUWAMOCO unofficial!

00:14:42.425 --> 00:14:46.247
Ask Karin-senpai for help with the text and action!

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:47.789
You mean...

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.521
Tanaka Cowboy Master.

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:54.104
Master Tanaka Cowboy Senpai!

00:14:54.364 --> 00:14:54.804
Ruffians!

00:14:54.844 --> 00:14:57.386
There's a battle going on.

00:14:57.406 --> 00:14:58.527
A big one.

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:29.171
The battle that determines who is going to be the true, real, the actual FUWAMOCO.

00:15:29.632 --> 00:15:31.834
The beautiful FUWAMOCO!

00:15:32.275 --> 00:15:37.901
And will also determine who's the nasty, dirty FUWAMOCO!

00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:39.406
Yeah!

00:15:39.847 --> 00:15:40.727
Yeah!

00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:51.812
That's because we're gonna be having a collab together with Koyori-senpai and Mami-senpai, who are the unofficially and lovingly referred to as dirty FUWAMOCO!

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:52.092
Yeah!

00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:55.294
The loving part is important, you know?

00:15:55.314 --> 00:15:55.694
Yeah!

00:15:56.194 --> 00:15:58.936
I see the comments being like, wow!

00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:00.116
Koyori!

00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:01.117
Koyori-senpai!

00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:01.997
Mami-senpai!

00:16:02.057 --> 00:16:02.918
They're wonderful!

00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:03.678
They're not dirty!

00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:05.039
They're not dirty.

00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:06.359
I know.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:06.699
I know.

00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:07.680
But, uh...

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:14.538
People saying that, oh no, this is what they're gonna be officially referred to as now from now on.

00:16:14.878 --> 00:16:18.560
Oh no, it's more like a dirty pear reference, no!

00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:30.425
But I would like to say, at first, Lamy-senpai, Koyori-senpai, they were known as the noisy FUWAMOCO, unicized FUWAMOCO.

00:16:31.085 --> 00:16:34.327
I've suddenly switched to becoming dirty FUWAMOCO!

00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:36.167
Is that because of Senchou-senpai?

00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:37.068
Might be.

00:16:37.228 --> 00:16:39.749
I don't- I don't see them as dirty!

00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:40.889
Why dirty?

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.250
Maybe noisy?

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.070
Noisy.

00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:43.491
Sure.

00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:51.594
Yeah, but you know we'll be finding out who is the real FUWAMOCO when we battle each other in Mario Party Jump!

00:16:52.555 --> 00:16:52.655
Yes!

00:16:53.015 --> 00:16:59.018
Over on Koyori-senpai's channel early tomorrow morning at 5AM PT!

00:16:59.098 --> 00:16:59.398
Yes!

00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.120
Impostor FUWAMOCO!

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.262
We are the impostors!

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.705
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:09.928
We have to find out tomorrow at 5am PT.

00:17:10.168 --> 00:17:11.530
Not you, Aizako.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.090
No.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.931
No.

00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:13.451
No.

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:18.216
Although, historically we're not the best tomorrow in Friday Night with Moco-chan.

00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:21.339
There's not that much history.

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:22.360
There is twice.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.021
Twice?

00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:23.782
Twice.

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.844
Third time's the charm.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.785
Third time is a charm, ha!

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:32.906
Please, please, please, please wish for a big day!

00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:37.267
Otherwise, you know... I don't know what's gonna happen, you know?

00:17:37.607 --> 00:17:42.208
Maybe I'll wake up and suddenly this'll still be the FUWAMOCO channel!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:46.249
Maybe it won't look a little different, maybe.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:47.770
You know?

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.290
I know.

00:17:49.648 --> 00:17:50.988
BAU BAU!

00:18:13.854 --> 00:18:14.554
Thank you!

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.895
BAU BAU!

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:19.856
Why Lamy-senpai?

00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:23.076
Well, you know Lamy-senpai's kind of blue.

00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:24.437
And Moco-chan's kind of pink.

00:18:24.497 --> 00:18:25.197
I am pink!

00:18:25.257 --> 00:18:26.977
I am not kind of pink!

00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:28.358
I am pink!

00:18:28.898 --> 00:18:31.159
Koyori-senpai's pretty pink too.

00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:31.919
I am pink!

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:34.039
Mococo is pink!

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:35.160
Got it.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.340
Moco-chan is very observant.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.660
I'm pink.

00:18:41.242 --> 00:18:42.642
Understood.

00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:46.864
I am pink!

00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:48.364
Yes.

00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:53.745
If you keep on slamming the desk, your paws definitely aren't gonna be pink.

00:18:55.066 --> 00:18:56.066
They already are.

00:18:56.686 --> 00:18:58.687
Because I am pink!

00:18:58.767 --> 00:18:58.947
Okay!

00:18:59.107 --> 00:18:59.567
Go at it!

00:18:59.607 --> 00:18:59.807
Yes.

00:19:03.748 --> 00:19:06.630
Okay Moco-chan, okay.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.171
Speaking of battles and Koyori-senpai!

00:19:10.712 --> 00:19:11.752
Ruffians!

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:16.275
There's also another big battle going on right now!

00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:17.975
At this very moment.

00:19:18.556 --> 00:19:24.439
And that battle is hololive Koshien!

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:28.941
A big baseball tournament is organized by Koyori-senpai.

00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:32.083
And actually involves all of hololive.

00:19:33.525 --> 00:19:35.045
Do you know what koushien is?

00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:36.086
Koushien.

00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:39.647
It's a big national baseball tournament in Japan.

00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:41.067
It can be confusing though.

00:19:41.767 --> 00:19:46.628
I always read koushien as yochien.

00:19:46.648 --> 00:19:48.229
It's kindergarten.

00:19:48.849 --> 00:19:49.589
It's different.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:50.029
No.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.990
It's not kindergarten.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.350
Not a kindergarten tournament.

00:19:54.197 --> 00:20:07.932
But in this big tournament in hololive Koshien, the game is actually a Power Pro Baseball!

00:20:08.372 --> 00:20:12.036
It's a game and there are five teams I think!

00:20:12.997 --> 00:20:21.359
At least a couple of them are led by AZKi-senpai, Kanata-senpai, Koyori-senpai, and Ririka!

00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:30.561
And they'll raise each team of theirs and bring them to the Koshien Tournament to find out which is the ultimate team, the team that will win the tournament!

00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:32.282
And you know all the team members!

00:20:33.122 --> 00:20:34.523
I'm hololive member!

00:20:35.163 --> 00:20:43.247
And you know, of course with this kind of thing, there's drama and dreams coming true, or being crushed, that's all part of the experience.

00:20:44.307 --> 00:20:52.171
But you know, right from the very first draft here, the draft meeting, the very beginning, there's already been a heartbreak.

00:20:53.492 --> 00:20:55.593
Can you guess what it was, Ruffians?

00:21:03.803 --> 00:21:04.663
Ruffians.

00:21:06.043 --> 00:21:07.124
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:07.964 --> 00:21:12.905
We've been separated from each other.

00:21:12.945 --> 00:21:13.945
Moco-chan.

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:18.466
Moco-chan is going to school Kanate in Osaka!

00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:20.626
And me, Fuwawa!

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:23.167
I'm going to koukou in Kyougoken.

00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:23.807
Wakareyade.

00:21:23.827 --> 00:21:24.187
Iwate!

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:24.567
Iwate!

00:21:24.607 --> 00:21:25.147
Wakareyade.

00:21:31.168 --> 00:21:36.149
We're gonna be spending the next three years separated.

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:37.070
Separated.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.510
We're different demon dogs.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.291
But you know what, Ruffians?

00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:46.192
We'll reunite together one day on the baseball field.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:52.393
And then surely legends will be made down in there, right?

00:21:52.534 --> 00:21:52.994
Right.

00:21:53.054 --> 00:21:54.054
That's how it works, right?

00:21:55.343 --> 00:22:00.244
But you never really know how hololive Koshien is going to go.

00:22:00.264 --> 00:22:03.685
So you don't even know about all of us hololive members are in it.

00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:07.386
But we just actually kept playing.

00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:13.047
We hope that you'll keep an eye on us and cheer for your favorite team!

00:22:13.487 --> 00:22:16.348
I think you know what friends you should cheer for.

00:22:16.388 --> 00:22:19.149
You should cheer for team Koyori!

00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:21.669
Koyori-senpai will lead us to victory!

00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:30.711
We'll smash the competition.

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:33.032
BAU BAU!

00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:37.413
I don't know any baseball chants.

00:22:37.993 --> 00:22:38.453
BAU!

00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:39.634
BAU!

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:40.514
KOIYO!

00:22:40.774 --> 00:22:41.394
BAU!

00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:42.274
BAU!

00:22:42.434 --> 00:22:43.474
KOIYO!

00:22:43.514 --> 00:22:45.715
Moco-chan, you can't copy!

00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:47.956
You can't copy Moco-chan!

00:22:48.196 --> 00:22:48.676
Koushien?

00:22:49.016 --> 00:22:50.276
Is that how it works?

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:51.476
I don't know.

00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:53.317
BAU BAU!

00:22:53.977 --> 00:22:55.537
I don't know anybody to choose from.

00:22:55.998 --> 00:22:57.098
Well, I don't know.

00:22:57.438 --> 00:22:59.578
Everybody likes to go to Koshien, right?

00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:00.639
I don't know.

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.899
Oh, Ruffians!

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:02.979
Yes!

00:23:03.459 --> 00:23:08.721
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've been very fortunate we survived.

00:23:10.101 --> 00:23:13.422
You know, and, well, I was kind of thinking...

00:23:15.513 --> 00:23:18.276
It's a box filled with exciting hololive lists!

00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:38.377
FUWAMOCO!

00:24:07.103 --> 00:24:13.206
How can the Ruffians get their own hololive merch subscription box?

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:17.048
I thought it would be pretty cool, right Ruffians?

00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:28.215
We figured out an answer!

00:24:28.235 --> 00:24:28.555
We did!

00:24:29.356 --> 00:24:29.996
All fixed!

00:24:30.016 --> 00:24:30.156
Yes!

00:24:30.196 --> 00:24:32.118
You two can have your own!

00:24:32.718 --> 00:24:35.480
Misty, hololive merchandise subscription box.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.683
Misty, because you don't know when it's going to arrive.

00:24:38.723 --> 00:24:45.188
Well, you just need to order some merch and you know it probably has a long pre-order window.

00:24:45.348 --> 00:24:48.451
And then, you completely forget about it.

00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:50.252
And then, suddenly!

00:24:50.272 --> 00:24:51.333
Surprise!

00:24:51.413 --> 00:24:52.314
BAU BAU!

00:24:55.116 --> 00:24:57.617
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:21.251
Hasn't been friends with you yet, huh?

00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:29.374
But Ruffians, you know it could still be friends with you if you order them now!

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:35.457
They're on sale and I heard that they may be released sometime in November it seems.

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:36.478
Really?

00:25:36.958 --> 00:25:38.519
I think that's what the shop said.

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:38.839
I don't know.

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:43.665
Wow, look what our next subscription box is gonna be like!

00:25:43.785 --> 00:25:46.308
I don't know what I'm gonna get here, all of Advent!

00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:48.171
Eventually though!

00:25:48.251 --> 00:25:49.453
It'll surprise us!

00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:50.674
Yes!

00:25:50.814 --> 00:25:51.936
And then we'll be surprised.

00:25:55.481 --> 00:25:57.343
BAU BAU!

00:26:12.379 --> 00:26:17.020
The fuzzies are so cute!

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.421
Not Mocotami.

00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:21.221
We think so too.

00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:22.502
That's what we ordered all of.

00:26:22.902 --> 00:26:27.303
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:28.943 --> 00:26:29.983
Ruffians.

00:26:30.584 --> 00:26:36.505
I have...

00:26:42.641 --> 00:26:44.842
Is that why we're fighting for so long?

00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:46.743
What's with the day to pick what the word is?

00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:51.524
Sorry, Ruffians.

00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:53.905
Just wait for FUWAMOCO to find the word, okay?

00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:56.006
Do you want any help?

00:26:56.026 --> 00:27:00.488
I think it starts with an A. A. Not an apology.

00:27:01.248 --> 00:27:01.568
No.

00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:04.709
Huh?

00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.447
Not an announcement.

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.330
No, not an announcement.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.571
Just adding a word.

00:27:18.612 --> 00:27:20.774
I'm gonna start with an A. A confession!

00:27:20.794 --> 00:27:24.059
No, I'm gonna start with a C. I don't know if it's a confession.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.881
A confession!

00:27:25.901 --> 00:27:26.682
In the comments.

00:27:27.503 --> 00:27:30.307
Well, maybe this kind of leads into what I'm gonna say next.

00:27:31.048 --> 00:27:32.189
A confession!

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.937
Today has not been a very fluffy day for me today.

00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:38.037
Yeah.

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:39.639
Ahhhh.

00:27:42.474 --> 00:27:42.594
Not an

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:47.142
No, it has noise!

00:27:47.162 --> 00:27:50.667
No, it has noise!

00:27:50.948 --> 00:27:57.697
It's just been one of those days where... It's kind of really... awkward.

00:27:59.058 --> 00:28:00.179
A bit out of it.

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:01.700
Yeah.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.742
You know, there's been multiple incidents.

00:28:05.103 --> 00:28:05.263
One!

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:09.546
I was trying to get off the elevator.

00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:13.549
Yeah, we were together with Morning-chan!

00:28:13.889 --> 00:28:16.491
And I almost pushed somebody over.

00:28:16.631 --> 00:28:17.372
Yeah.

00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:17.872
Yeah.

00:28:19.253 --> 00:28:20.434
And it felt really bad.

00:28:20.654 --> 00:28:21.875
Morning-chan was late.

00:28:21.895 --> 00:28:22.856
Morning-chan was late!

00:28:22.996 --> 00:28:24.137
So I'm like, huh?

00:28:24.157 --> 00:28:24.277
What?

00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:25.838
And you're like...

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:28.738
Other person, are you good too?

00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:28.919
Yeah.

00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:32.417
And then.

00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:33.057
Somehow.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:56.652
I kind of... Almost... Surprised somebody so much they fell over too!

00:28:56.752 --> 00:28:57.713
Yeah!

00:28:58.473 --> 00:29:03.515
Yeah... Uh... Yeah... It was very close.

00:29:05.016 --> 00:29:07.817
That was the second incident too, Ruffians!

00:29:07.837 --> 00:29:10.038
Yeah... Fuwawa howl!

00:29:10.118 --> 00:29:11.218
I don't know how!

00:29:11.258 --> 00:29:12.759
Villain oink!

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:16.160
I was just standing there and then they almost died!

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.581
Yeah... Yeah...

00:29:20.964 --> 00:29:23.149
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:29.657 --> 00:29:35.158
Ruffians, you know, you're about to start your day off on the right paw.

00:30:00.566 --> 00:30:01.909
I beat you.

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:03.633
Because I was way more embarrassed.

00:30:09.732 --> 00:30:10.912
You have a lot of those!

00:30:11.192 --> 00:30:14.654
Well, I beat you, so... Don't worry.

00:30:14.694 --> 00:30:15.954
It's a fight now, okay?

00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:16.214
Yeah.

00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:18.215
You were beaten.

00:30:19.455 --> 00:30:21.956
BAU BAU!

00:30:22.016 --> 00:30:24.917
Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit more of a fluffy day.

00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:26.237
Yeah, just a bit more fluffy.

00:30:26.277 --> 00:30:26.537
Yeah.

00:30:26.637 --> 00:30:28.158
Let's hope.

00:30:28.518 --> 00:30:34.460
And you know, hopefully I can fall asleep properly and not think of... I just don't know how I should go.

00:30:37.553 --> 00:30:43.763
But if I do well, that's just how things are sometimes.

00:30:44.304 --> 00:30:46.187
BAU BAU!

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:48.070
What about a wrestling match?

00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:50.093
A wrestling match against myself!

00:30:51.673 --> 00:30:54.235
I think everybody does that outfit everyday, huh?

00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:55.376
You shouldn't though.

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.878
That's an accurate description.

00:30:56.918 --> 00:30:58.719
Because you do not deserve it!

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.121
BAU BAU!

00:31:00.141 --> 00:31:01.562
I don't deserve that.

00:31:02.122 --> 00:31:03.043
Moco-chan!

00:31:03.203 --> 00:31:04.985
Did I start the Pup Talk already?

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:07.447
I think you started the Pup Talk already.

00:31:08.428 --> 00:31:08.628
Hi!

00:31:08.648 --> 00:31:10.570
Are you getting a Pup Talk today, Moco-chan?

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.733
You're so excited, it's just... It's going all out of bounds.

00:31:17.057 --> 00:31:21.541
FUWAMOCO-chan, can we hear some more motivational words from you then?

00:31:23.503 --> 00:31:24.484
I guess.

00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:26.586
BAU BAU!

00:31:27.007 --> 00:31:30.570
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:33.013
Ruffians!

00:31:34.367 --> 00:31:35.448
It's that time!

00:31:36.609 --> 00:31:37.810
That time again!

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.431
The time of week!

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:43.895
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:31:44.515 --> 00:31:46.877
And you're gonna hear it from me!

00:31:48.298 --> 00:31:49.139
Straight from me!

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:51.180
Mococo!

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.622
Ruffians!

00:31:53.642 --> 00:31:56.465
How are you feeling?

00:31:56.485 --> 00:32:00.348
A bit cold.

00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:02.850
A bit...

00:32:03.908 --> 00:32:04.408
Hot!

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:06.969
A bit hot and cold!

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.910
Wow!

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.471
It's that time of year again, huh?

00:32:12.331 --> 00:32:20.234
Where the seasons are changing, and it's hard to keep up, and it's easy to come down with a little bit of something to light.

00:32:22.575 --> 00:32:24.956
Have you been sneezing a bit more than usual?

00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:34.476
I know it can be a bit rough trying to take care of your everyday life and trying to stay up and date with the hustle and bustle of everything.

00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:41.919
Maybe... Maybe your head feels like it's been installed backwards to how it usually is.

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:43.260
Ha.

00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:46.922
Maybe some people are especially high.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.721
Let's do our best!

00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:51.401
Okay!

00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:52.681
To bundle up!

00:32:53.322 --> 00:32:54.482
To drink warm drinks!

00:32:55.103 --> 00:32:56.403
Put on fuzzy socks!

00:32:57.163 --> 00:33:00.225
And make ourselves cozy as we continue to do our best, okay?

00:33:01.726 --> 00:33:04.667
You know, you might be a bit slower than usual.

00:33:04.687 --> 00:33:05.967
And that's okay.

00:33:06.988 --> 00:33:09.129
You know, it's cold after all, okay?

00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:11.378
Be kind to yourself.

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:13.360
I believe in you!

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.782

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:23.608
Yeah, fuzzy socks.

00:33:23.688 --> 00:33:25.409
What about the fluffy socks?

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.011
If you have fluffy socks I guess that's okay too.

00:33:35.517 --> 00:33:35.718
Yeah!

00:33:36.923 --> 00:33:40.169
Today's Doggie of the Day is... That.

00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:43.955
Walkie!

00:33:45.096 --> 00:33:45.276
Mama!

00:33:45.316 --> 00:33:47.359
Oh, is this Walkie's Halloween costume?

00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:51.786
I don't know, maybe it's Walkie's first day on the job.

00:33:52.547 --> 00:33:56.532
Dog's a job, other than just being a guard dog.

00:33:56.552 --> 00:33:58.355
I don't know, but it looks like him!

00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:06.066
Walkie was inspired by us!

00:34:07.207 --> 00:34:07.348
Really?

00:34:07.368 --> 00:34:07.468
Yeah!

00:34:07.488 --> 00:34:07.588
Mama!

00:34:07.608 --> 00:34:08.029
Do your best, Walkie!

00:34:08.049 --> 00:34:11.113
You know, you have a very important job.

00:34:11.261 --> 00:34:14.142
To become the best FUWAMOCIST you can be!

00:34:14.162 --> 00:34:15.343
I'm a FUWAMOCIST!

00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:17.544
I don't know anything about FUWAMOCY.

00:34:18.704 --> 00:34:19.145
No.

00:34:23.987 --> 00:34:25.567
Look at that bowtie!

00:34:25.928 --> 00:34:26.888
It's blue, Moco-chan.

00:34:26.928 --> 00:34:27.268

That's not a very clear voice.

00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:44.445
I don't know if the old dogs can hear that.

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:48.667
What was that?

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:55.491
It sounds like a car.

00:34:56.992 --> 00:34:57.272
What?

00:34:57.352 --> 00:34:57.812
No!

00:34:58.152 --> 00:34:59.253
That's a walkie, okay?

00:34:59.353 --> 00:35:00.493
That's a walkie?

00:35:00.593 --> 00:35:03.335
I'm sorry walkie, you sound a little bit like a car.

00:35:20.432 --> 00:35:25.414
I think Ruffians, we're in good paws here with Walkie, right?

00:35:25.454 --> 00:35:25.874
Right!

00:35:26.034 --> 00:35:26.395
Look!

00:35:26.495 --> 00:35:28.916
Walkie takes things seriously.

00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:29.596
Very cute.

00:35:29.896 --> 00:35:30.756
And you know what?

00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:35.658

You have to go and see Walkie.

Oh my gosh, you're able to come and visit a really, really special place to you!

00:36:07.206 --> 00:36:11.088
Your favorite childhood park!

00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:12.569
You know what?

00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:21.953
FUWAMOCO, we're kind of thinking about how it would be so nice to go back and visit some trails and really like exploring as puppies on the Northwest Passage.

00:36:22.073 --> 00:36:23.694
Yeah, that would be nice!

00:36:23.774 --> 00:36:24.094
Right?

00:36:24.154 --> 00:36:26.315
But not quite yet, you know?

00:36:26.916 --> 00:36:28.216
But the weather here!

00:36:28.817 --> 00:36:29.637
It's beautiful skies.

00:36:29.697 --> 00:36:32.419
Blue skies!

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.282
The grass and everything!

00:36:35.382 --> 00:36:40.486
Thank you for bringing us and sharing such a special place of yours together with us!

00:36:40.906 --> 00:36:44.850
FUWAMOCO!

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.272

Let's take a look at the Question of the Day today!

00:36:50.254 --> 00:36:52.016

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:56.679
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:36:56.739 --> 00:37:00.622
My first meet-and-greet with Shiori and Hatsune was so fun!

00:37:00.682 --> 00:37:01.803
Yeah, we're so glad!

00:37:02.243 --> 00:37:06.066
Have you been to meet-and-greet event of your favorite singer?

00:37:06.386 --> 00:37:09.729
What was your first experience after attending that type of event?

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:11.710
BAU BAU!

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.552
We have been!

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.794
Our first experience!

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:24.122
Wow, that was an idol that we really, really loved!

00:37:24.222 --> 00:37:28.165
And you know, the first thing... Moco-chan, you remember the first thing, right?

00:37:28.405 --> 00:37:33.529
Hearing her really super cute voice in the distance!

00:37:33.629 --> 00:37:35.290
It's like... Different!

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.151
It's different!

00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:38.693
It hits you in the heart, in the head drums.

00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:40.715
Have a howl of a day!

00:37:57.215 --> 00:37:58.996
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:29.143 --> 00:38:34.146
Hugs are so soft!

00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:42.451
We understand a bit, you know, when the Ruffians get nervous or maybe a bit emotional when they meet us for the first time.

00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:45.052
We can understand how it was for us too.

00:38:46.753 --> 00:38:47.173
Yeah.

00:38:47.433 --> 00:38:49.334
We don't want you to be nervous, okay?

00:38:49.514 --> 00:38:50.174
No.

00:38:50.314 --> 00:38:51.875
There's no reason to be nervous.

00:38:52.115 --> 00:38:53.736
I imagine your hands are sweaty.

00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:55.977
I don't think my hands are sweaty!

00:38:56.077 --> 00:38:56.717
Ruffians!

00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:58.077
Me and Rins are scared.

00:38:58.117 --> 00:38:59.458
Don't be scared!

00:38:59.538 --> 00:39:02.659
We're here to protect your smile, okay?

00:39:02.859 --> 00:39:05.100
But it's hard to love fans, you know?

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.802

Thank you all for your patience!

00:39:56.347 --> 00:39:59.570
We should probably take a look at our next team coming up here!

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.772
Our next team is... De-den!

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.493

00:40:08.555 --> 00:40:10.836
Yeah, we're watching interview with THE VAMPIRE!

00:40:10.896 --> 00:40:13.838
But we are not interviewing a vampire!

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:14.339
No.

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:17.541
But we're doing so all together with Abyss!

00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:22.084
So we hope that you'll join us and watch interview with the vampire all together!

00:40:24.256 --> 00:40:25.678
I wonder how it will be.

00:40:25.878 --> 00:40:28.440
Last year's spooky movies were really spooky.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.483
All we know is it's an interview with a vampire.

00:40:31.843 --> 00:40:33.445
And Nerissa wanted to watch it.

00:40:33.505 --> 00:40:34.766
Nerissa suggested it.

00:40:35.227 --> 00:40:37.308
So I'm thinking it's more a Nerissa movie.

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:39.951
And she also suggested the Barbie movie.

00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:42.673
So I'm thinking somewhere in between vampire and Barbie.

00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:43.034
That's it!

00:40:47.298 --> 00:40:49.400
BAU BAU!

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.303
I must take a look at our schedule!

00:40:52.524 --> 00:40:57.869
Well, Ruffians, we also forgot to mention something that's very important!

00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.732
Ruffians!

00:41:00.012 --> 00:41:04.497
I wanted to say a big thank you for your submissions today!

00:41:05.097 --> 00:41:06.379
We're always looking

00:41:06.779 --> 00:41:11.624
For more Pero Sightings, unfortunately, we want to see a Doggie of the Day.

00:41:11.644 --> 00:41:13.446
Some just a Doggie of the Day.

00:41:13.506 --> 00:41:14.406
Let's jump in.

00:41:14.587 --> 00:41:15.287
You walk.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:17.569
Since you walk, we're waiting for them.

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:19.451
So don't forget to use the hashtag.

00:41:19.792 --> 00:41:21.814
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:41:21.874 --> 00:41:22.334
BAU BAU!

00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:31.228
Well, we're gonna be racing in Assetto Corsa Cortezion.

00:41:52.451 --> 00:41:52.712
Yes!

00:41:52.752 --> 00:41:54.214
We sing chorus!

00:41:54.314 --> 00:41:56.357
Together with hololive English!

00:41:56.378 --> 00:41:56.938
And we have...

00:41:58.066 --> 00:41:58.807
No practice.

00:41:59.947 --> 00:42:01.048
We're gonna get a wheel.

00:42:01.088 --> 00:42:02.209
The wheel's not gonna work.

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:03.529
Not gonna work.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.531
Have we downloaded the game?

00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:05.851
No.

00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:12.355
But we're gonna practice because we need to practice because the game is very very complicated.

00:42:12.395 --> 00:42:13.756
Driving is complicated.

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:14.516
FUWAMOCO!

00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:19.339
We're good at driving because we can drive a fast hospital car and ambulance.

00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:21.240
What does shifting gears do?

00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:26.123
You don't need to shift gears in an ambulance.

00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:28.205
Let's go.

00:42:28.885 --> 00:42:30.686
Can we just drive the Albion one?

00:42:30.946 --> 00:42:31.806
Yes!

00:42:33.607 --> 00:42:35.848
But we gotta make sure that we win the race!

00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:36.608
Yes!

00:42:36.848 --> 00:42:39.369
And that means we have to destroy the competition.

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:39.989
Yeah!

00:42:40.469 --> 00:42:41.409
BAU BAU!

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.570
BAU BAU!

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.911
And on Friday, well it's Friday so we're spending Friday night on Fridays!

00:42:47.011 --> 00:42:47.351
Yeah!

00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:50.592
We have five nights on Fridays that are all Friday.

00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:51.713
Those nights are Friday.

00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:51.793
Yes.

00:42:53.828 --> 00:42:56.452
We played the first game almost to completion.

00:42:56.472 --> 00:42:58.716
Apparently we're somehow pretty good at it.

00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:01.299
I think it's because of the Ruffians.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.301
I think so too.

00:43:02.321 --> 00:43:06.467
The Ruffians couldn't make us good again at it.

00:43:06.647 --> 00:43:09.111
So please hold our paws okay?

00:43:09.952 --> 00:43:10.993
BAU BAU!

00:43:11.153 --> 00:43:16.395
And then after that, we're gonna be watching Mikochi-senpai's very first solo concert.

00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:17.876
May 8th in the morning.

00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:19.777
At 1.45am PT.

00:43:20.317 --> 00:43:22.639
We're really looking forward to it.

00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:25.040
You can get your streaming tickets on SPWN.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.862
We're gonna be watching there live as it happens.

00:43:28.982 --> 00:43:30.863
So we hope that you'll join us for that.

00:43:31.283 --> 00:43:39.050
But if you decide not to sleep in, well, you might not get too much sleep after that because we're gonna be playing a very scary game called Vsauce.

00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:41.893
Only reason we're playing it is because of Fubuki-senpai.

00:43:41.913 --> 00:43:42.714
Fubuki-senpai.

00:43:42.754 --> 00:43:44.536
It's Fubuki-senpai's fault officially.

00:43:44.556 --> 00:43:46.537
We get to blame Fubuki-senpai.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.101
Fubuki-senpai.

00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:52.263
Fububui.

00:43:52.283 --> 00:43:53.624
Fubuki-senpai.

00:44:00.274 --> 00:44:01.579
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:02.823
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:44:08.335 --> 00:44:09.656
BAU BAU!

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:15.039
And then on Sunday, there might be something kinda early on Sunday morning.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.300
We'll see.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:24.445
And then we're gonna be having a nice, comfy, cozy time chatting and reading some Super Chats all together too.

00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:26.246
BAU BAU!

00:44:26.326 --> 00:44:27.627
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:44:28.107 --> 00:44:34.651
And for the Ruffians joining us in the archive today, your FUWAMOCO word is... BAU BAU!

00:44:34.811 --> 00:44:36.392

00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:55.583

00:45:23.691 --> 00:45:28.994
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!
