00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:39.924
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.544
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:53.099
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.560
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:59.602
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.443
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:05.484
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:06.785
BAU BAU!

00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:08.845
Ruffians!

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:11.266
Bye bye!

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.006
Thank you!

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:15.547
Thank you for joining us again!

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:22.509
Especially today, it's our 122nd episode!

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.049
BAU BAU!

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:25.629
Good number!

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.230
BAU BAU!

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.310
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.571
Back to regular schedule!

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:35.372
It feels like it's been forever huh?

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:41.735
There's been so many things going on, so... Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us!

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:42.636
Especially now!

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:47.439
Summer is now officially ended, and now it's time for something new!

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.942
Thank you for continuing to join us despite new things going on too!

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:55.524
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.885 --> 00:07:00.608
Well, maybe there's some Ruffians who are joining us today for the first time.

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:08.435
Well, to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:09.916
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:10.957
It's FUWAMOCO.

00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:13.719
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.023
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:21.343 --> 00:07:28.107
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:32.289
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:35.870
BAU BAU!

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.592
Are you happy we're back?

00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:41.333
I'm happy, Ruffians.

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:44.656
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:46.517
It's been a while, FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:46.877
I'm back!

00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:47.317
I'm back!

00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:53.241
You're the first FUWAMOCO Morning in a little while!

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.582
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:56.403 --> 00:07:57.864
Wow, you know what?

00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:01.666
There's been so many exciting things going on for FUWAMOCO.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:02.747
Going up?

00:08:02.807 --> 00:08:03.587
Going on!

00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:03.908
Going on!

00:08:03.928 --> 00:08:04.908
Going on, going on.

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:07.670
So, let's check them out!

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:09.371
Good job!

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:10.932
That's what I like to see.

00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:22.622
Well... It's hard to say, but... What's hard to say?

00:08:22.642 --> 00:08:25.563
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:27.004
Why?

00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:28.085
Why?

00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:29.125
Why?

00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:31.006
I haven't seen Pero for a while!

00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:33.948
I haven't seen him, that's so useful.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:39.490
Well, let's see where he was spotted this time.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.211
Okay.

00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:41.351
Okay.

00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:42.752
De-den!

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.253
Huh?

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.054
What the heck?

00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:50.695
Why is Pero here?

00:08:50.835 --> 00:08:52.996
And Sidewalk Chalk.

00:08:53.336 --> 00:09:05.320
I guess, you know, Sidewalk Chalk is a fun summer activity, but it is Pero getting innocent children to draw flattering images, flattering portraits of him.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.242
It does look pretty good here.

00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:16.233
What happens to the children afterwards, you know, after they finish the portraits?

00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:18.774
Despicable.

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:20.954
I don't know.

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:27.957
I don't know, we can only hope Ruffians maybe they have some leftover pudding on them or... Eat stone.

00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:30.162
Pudding.

00:09:30.562 --> 00:09:30.842
Pudding.

00:09:30.882 --> 00:09:31.722
He likes pudding.

00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:35.183
Everyone likes pudding and Sighting and Rock Talk together, right?

00:09:35.223 --> 00:09:35.563
Yeah.

00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:36.883
The best summer, right?

00:09:36.923 --> 00:09:37.684
Right, yeah!

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.604
It's not like the children would be hungry and eat the pudding.

00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:40.664
No.

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:43.565
Yeah, but this is such a good drawing.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.505
Yeah, right!

00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:48.786
He looks very cute, almost.

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:50.526
Very round.

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:51.706
Perfectly round.

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:54.967
I can only think of our poor children.

00:09:57.966 --> 00:09:59.146
We have pudding, I'm sure.

00:09:59.306 --> 00:09:59.727
I'm sure.

00:09:59.747 --> 00:10:01.627
Let's hope children have pudding on them.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.047
Yeah.

00:10:02.307 --> 00:10:02.588
Yeah.

00:10:03.988 --> 00:10:06.289
BAU BAU!

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:06.809
BAU BAU!

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:09.950
Pero's a good baby, so as long as there's pudding, it's alright.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.771
Pudding and pudding.

00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:13.111
BAU BAU!

00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:14.992
It's for the best, okay?

00:10:15.032 --> 00:10:15.572
For the best.

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:17.227
Wow!

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.008
Happy new year!

00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:22.050
BAU BAU!

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.832
Good news, Ruffians!

00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:28.293
FUWAMOCO!

00:10:28.553 --> 00:10:35.577
We just released our first original song at the beginning of August as part of our first anniversary!

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:37.918
Just about a month ago now!

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.800
It's Born to be Balladol!

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.502
And it's a very energetic, very FUWAMOCO song.

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:50.463
It's like if you just kind of balled us all up and put us into a song.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:52.944
Thanks to you!

00:10:53.705 --> 00:10:57.666
Born to be Balladol has actually reached over 500,000 views!

00:10:57.686 --> 00:10:58.367
BAU BAU!

00:10:58.387 --> 00:10:59.447
Thank you!

00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:02.848
Thank you so much!

00:11:02.908 --> 00:11:04.229
BAU BAU!

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:05.850
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:08.652
Thank you!

00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:17.259
You know, it means so so much to us because it's our original song and we're just so happy that you're listening to it live.

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:18.661
That you're enjoying it!

00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:28.389
Yeah, and I'm sure you know not just listening to it but singing along, dancing, and most importantly, BAU BAU-ing at the same time too!

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:29.870
A lot of those views are from you.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.092
I'm sure hot.

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:32.892
Thank you.

00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:34.412
All 500,000 of them!

00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:43.396
Yeah, you know, Balladol, it means so much to us, and it really means the world that you love it so much, Ruffians.

00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:45.237
Thank you.

00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:47.157
It's really fun!

00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:48.418
It's beating your head!

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:53.860
Omochis, you put the sacred book on her head too, apparently.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.961
She kept on being like, Fuwafuwaa.

00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.201
Mocomoco.

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:06.900
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.801
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:24.586
I don't know about that one, Moco-chan.

00:12:25.306 --> 00:12:26.607
Maybe.

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:29.869
BAU BAU in your sleep, baby.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:37.393
But hopefully, one day, we hope that it can reach 1 million listens here on YouTube soon!

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:46.198
So Ruffians, please make sure you continue to dance along, practice your moves, and BAU BAU together lots with it, okay?

00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:47.839
Okay, Ruffians!

00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:49.159
Gonna promise.

00:12:51.498 --> 00:12:51.698
Yeah!

00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:51.919
Thank you!

00:13:06.942 --> 00:13:19.891
I'm sure you know that just a little bit more than a week ago, all of hololive English, we were in New York for our second concert, BREAKING DIMENSIONS!

00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:24.855
Of course too, FUWAMOCO, we had to perform our original song.

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.896
We had to perform BAU BAU there.

00:13:27.477 --> 00:13:28.357
We decided this.

00:13:28.437 --> 00:13:29.198
Nobody made it.

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.391
Yeah, did you see?

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:34.452
Yeah, did you see?

00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:35.353
Look, Ruffians!

00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:37.595
All your fans!

00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:39.637
Thank you!

00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:42.580
See a pink and blue!

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.361
FUWAMOCO colors!

00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:47.024
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:48.145
Thank you!

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:49.345
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:50.346

00:13:50.406 --> 00:13:51.286

FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.452
Thank you Ruffians!

00:14:09.492 --> 00:14:10.793
Thank you!

00:14:11.033 --> 00:14:16.277
If you missed it, you can check it out on SPWN on Spawn or Streaming.

00:14:16.497 --> 00:14:19.079
Also you can get streaming tickets in the archives too.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:26.464
Or you can also check out there's a bit of a sneak peek over on the hololive English YouTube channel.

00:14:26.484 --> 00:14:31.227
And there might be some good things there if you check it out.

00:14:31.247 --> 00:14:32.928
Like there's a reason we can show this to you.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:34.768
You lost your voice!

00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:36.569
That's good!

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.309
Thank you Ruffians.

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:41.570
It really was a dream come true to us, you know.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.451
Just seeing that- Oh!

00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:44.911
The penlights too!

00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:45.612
Look at them!

00:14:45.692 --> 00:14:48.052
Hearing your big BAU BAU's in person.

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:05.260
You screamed so much!

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.798
We'll never forget it!

00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:11.860
And we'll keep on waking live for next time!

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.541
If there is ever a next time!

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.422
Hopefully a next time again!

00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:17.783
It's not a given, okay?

00:15:18.204 --> 00:15:24.608
We really hope that one day we can stand on an even bigger stage right in front of you!

00:15:24.628 --> 00:15:28.711
And we can BAU BAU and have even more fun together, that's true.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:30.832
Thank you Ruffians!

00:15:30.852 --> 00:15:31.392
Thank you!

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:32.213
BAU BAU!

00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:36.673
You broke into tears the moment the song started up.

00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:40.495
Sorry for making you cry right away!

00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:43.016
I understand.

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:44.696
BAU BAU!

00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:45.577
BAU BAU!

00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:47.217
Thank you!

00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:48.618
Thank you!

00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:50.059
Please check it out too!

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:54.320
I think you know FUWAMOCO, we might have lots of fun coming up too.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.261
Yeah!

00:15:55.781 --> 00:15:58.622
Maybe we can reveal our breaking dimensions all together.

00:15:58.722 --> 00:15:59.663
All together!

00:15:59.783 --> 00:16:00.783
And with secret stories.

00:16:02.907 --> 00:16:05.349
BAU BAU!

00:16:06.989 --> 00:16:09.471
Well, you know, we're in New York.

00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:24.139
And then, you know, just this weekend, right after Breaking Dimensions, we were all together with Abyssgard at Anime Impulse in California for a guest appearance.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:27.961
Look at us there!

00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:30.743
We had so so much fun!

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:37.746
I'm just surprised too, you know, we didn't think that we'd get to see the Ruffians so soon after Breaking Dimension.

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:38.226
Yeah.

00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:39.827
And we had so much fun.

00:16:39.907 --> 00:16:43.309
It was a bit of an early morning, you know.

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:46.310
But we were able to spend so much time together.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.731
It was so much fun.

00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:50.833
It was a lot of cute and funny, you know, together.

00:16:50.853 --> 00:16:52.614
All together with Advent.

00:16:52.634 --> 00:16:54.775
We argued, debated.

00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:59.157
Together, not just with Advent, but with you two in the audience.

00:16:59.637 --> 00:17:01.558
FUWAMOCO Being able to see your face!

00:17:01.578 --> 00:17:02.299
Your voice!

00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:18.962
Yeah.

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:19.222
Yeah.

00:17:19.262 --> 00:17:19.642
Yeah.

00:17:19.842 --> 00:17:20.263
Yeah.

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:20.683
Yeah.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.730
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:40.971
Thank you!

00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:45.412
We hope we can chat even more in the future with hololive Mii, okay?

00:17:45.452 --> 00:17:47.353
Just call us, okay?

00:17:48.073 --> 00:17:50.374
BAU BAU!

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:51.575
BAU BAU!

00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:52.715
You are so cute.

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:56.776
It's really just so much fun.

00:17:57.497 --> 00:18:02.178
I wish we could have been able to do like hololive Mii after breaking the mention there.

00:18:03.118 --> 00:18:03.379
Why?

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.746
Why did we not do it?

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:07.107
Yeah.

00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:08.107
Why?

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:09.387
Yeah.

00:18:09.948 --> 00:18:10.748
FUWAMOCO is safe!

00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:11.968
FUWAMOCO every corner!

00:18:11.988 --> 00:18:12.829
Yeah!

00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:13.289
Please!

00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:14.109
Please!

00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:14.509
Please!

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:15.650
BAU BAU!

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.430
Yeah!

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.451
We really wanna go everywhere and anywhere.

00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:23.133
Especially if it's close to you, Ruffians.

00:18:23.453 --> 00:18:25.854
We wanna go everywhere so we can't say everywhere.

00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:26.674
We wanna go!

00:18:26.694 --> 00:18:27.194
We wanna go!

00:18:27.214 --> 00:18:27.755
We wanna go!

00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:28.815
Follow with you.

00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:36.197
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:37.619
BAU BAU!

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:45.407
As you can kinda maybe tell, it's been a bit of a whirlwind of crazy excitement ever since Breaking Dimensions.

00:18:46.068 --> 00:18:58.810
But within everything going on, FUWAMOCO, we also released a brand new cover song of the ending theme from the TV anime, Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai.

00:18:59.111 --> 00:19:01.291
Love is Indivisible by Twins.

00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:05.412
And the song is... Honey Citron!

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.212
BAU BAU!

00:19:07.252 --> 00:19:09.112
Did you listen?

00:19:09.172 --> 00:19:09.893
What'd you think?

00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:11.593
What'd you think of this?

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:13.714
A bit, a bit different.

00:19:14.094 --> 00:19:17.336
Yeah, it's a bit different from our previous song coverings.

00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:22.960
Because this time, we're directly asked to sing it from the anime team!

00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:25.322
Official coverings!

00:19:25.502 --> 00:19:26.923
That doesn't happen!

00:19:26.983 --> 00:19:28.184
Isn't that so cool?

00:19:28.324 --> 00:19:29.945
Right!

00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:36.429
We're just really really happy because while Futaki was already in anime we were really looking forward to.

00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:39.891
And then to suddenly be asked to sing their song!

00:19:40.432 --> 00:19:40.672
Right!

00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:42.713
It's a really big step, you know?

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:43.513
It's a big deal.

00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:43.613
Yeah.

00:19:43.893 --> 00:19:50.455
So you know, so we put all, everything, everything, all of our power into the recording of it.

00:19:50.515 --> 00:19:50.775
Yeah.

00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:54.076
It was like, our only anime song.

00:19:54.556 --> 00:19:56.877
It's not though, it's not.

00:19:56.997 --> 00:19:57.337
Yeah.

00:19:57.437 --> 00:20:01.299
But you know, at the very least, it's an official cover song.

00:20:01.339 --> 00:20:01.959
Yeah!

00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:02.619
Right?

00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:03.499
Official!

00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:05.160
Not quite our anime song.

00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:06.442
In our heart.

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:09.625
In our heart, in our delusions, right?

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.367
Yeah, it's a very very cute song.

00:20:12.407 --> 00:20:16.750
Especially, you know, if you like their last cover song, Let Me Be With You.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.592
I think you'll like Honeysuchan a lot too.

00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:21.314
Please have a listen.

00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:25.257
Also, the illustrations in the video, this illustration right here.

00:20:25.737 --> 00:20:30.841
It's illustrated by the original light novel illustrator, Arumiku-sensei!

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:31.001
Right?

00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:34.403
It's a huge honor!

00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:37.892
Please check it out, okay?

00:20:37.912 --> 00:20:38.893
You can't miss it!

00:20:39.053 --> 00:20:40.874
Please listen to it lots, and also!

00:20:40.894 --> 00:20:44.055
Futakire, the anime, is still airing right now!

00:20:44.355 --> 00:20:46.896
You can check it out over on Crunchyroll!

00:20:47.316 --> 00:20:49.637
But it's a really interesting love comedy.

00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:53.018
Very drama, not really comedy.

00:20:53.098 --> 00:20:54.419
Yeah, between twins.

00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:57.140
A bit of a love triangle.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.902
So, Ruffians, maybe if you could... I don't know why it's called a comedy.

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:05.023
It's a bit of a love triangle.

00:21:05.283 --> 00:21:11.547
If you're curious, maybe what that would be like or maybe what kind of disaster that would be like.

00:21:12.448 --> 00:21:14.409
You'll need to check it out, okay?

00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:19.712
BAU BAU!

00:21:20.093 --> 00:21:21.073
It's a dramedy.

00:21:21.093 --> 00:21:24.355
I don't even know about that.

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:26.737
I don't know who called it a comedy.

00:21:28.062 --> 00:21:29.963
I think their idea of comedy is different.

00:21:30.604 --> 00:21:30.904
Yeah.

00:21:31.324 --> 00:21:33.826
There's a lot of silly things going on, that's for sure.

00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:33.986
Yeah.

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:35.387
Please check it out, Wolfie!

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:35.967

There's an event going on called ENigmatic Recollection!

00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:05.808
Have you been watching Ruffians?

00:22:05.888 --> 00:22:07.389
Yeah, have you seen it?

00:22:08.109 --> 00:22:14.633
Right now it's in process of a big special brand-wide event, an original content project.

00:22:15.654 --> 00:22:20.477
And in it, all of us hololive English members, we are the main characters!

00:22:23.065 --> 00:22:24.866
We've sort of lost our memories, huh?

00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:26.266
Sort of lost our memories.

00:22:26.767 --> 00:22:30.208
The world is the kingdom of lobestos.

00:22:30.388 --> 00:22:32.909
And there, the lobestians live!

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.491
And you know the world is kind of plagued with stains.

00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:38.292
Calamity.

00:22:38.372 --> 00:22:39.432
Calamity.

00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:45.955
But it's okay because we, all of hololive English, we are there as heroes!

00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:48.436
And we'll unlock our memories again!

00:22:48.496 --> 00:22:50.417
And we'll save all of lobestos!

00:22:50.837 --> 00:22:52.860
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:23:11.398 --> 00:23:15.323
Things are getting more and more crazy with everyday eating hot pot.

00:23:15.783 --> 00:23:19.047
And we'll do our best, especially with our labestin cloaks.

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:22.431
Very, very special hero cloaks.

00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:25.448
But also for En Record!

00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:29.371
We're also on the special Watch Party Show!

00:23:29.632 --> 00:23:33.775
Did you watch all fans?

00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:34.515
Yeah!

00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:45.484
We were there this time not singing, but kind of sharing some really exciting information and playing games together with our senpai for the very first time!

00:23:45.504 --> 00:23:49.267
Kronii-senpai, Ai-senpai, Ina-senpai, and Kiara-senpai!

00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:52.327
Do you forgive her yet, Moco-chan?

00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:53.769
I forgive her.

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:55.430
Why don't you forget?

00:23:57.392 --> 00:23:57.952
Don't forget.

00:24:00.153 --> 00:24:07.636
Please check it out, there's a lot of funny moments, especially, you know, where you're kinda like, I still don't quite get what ENReco is.

00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:11.058
It will probably help you get up to speed a little bit.

00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:12.378
You know?

00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:22.222
And, well, maybe it's a little bit of spoilers, but FUWAMOCO, we have been sorted into your G-Zord, you know?

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:27.104
FUWAMOCO, I guess you know they're like, FUWAMOCO, you have courage, you have grit.

00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:28.605
Sure.

00:24:28.965 --> 00:24:29.185
Yeah.

00:24:29.943 --> 00:24:37.548
And that's where we are together with mysterious Calli, Elizabeth, and John Watson.

00:24:38.588 --> 00:24:39.549
Ame-senpai.

00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:41.250
Not John Watson.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:48.594
And also right now you can also check out the official ENigmatic Recollection!

00:24:51.295 --> 00:24:51.895
ENReco!

00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:52.856
ENReco!

00:24:52.916 --> 00:24:54.737
We call it ENReco for a reason.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:57.518
The official theme song.

00:24:57.818 --> 00:24:58.819
Start again.

00:24:58.919 --> 00:25:04.441
Sung by Ai-senpai, Calli-senpai, Nerissa, and Elizabeth.

00:25:04.481 --> 00:25:06.662
It's very... What's the word?

00:25:07.603 --> 00:25:09.804
It's very hype, but it's sort of different, huh?

00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:10.164
Right?

00:25:10.224 --> 00:25:11.304
It's sort of different.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:12.745
It makes you sort of want to bounce.

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.806
Bounce and stomp.

00:25:15.086 --> 00:25:15.366
Stomp.

00:25:15.406 --> 00:25:17.027
March maybe a little bit.

00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:23.246
Am I the only one who wants to bounce and stomp?

00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:25.807
Right!

00:25:26.187 --> 00:25:29.627
Right, and it's animated as well!

00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:31.968
Please go take a look at it!

00:25:32.468 --> 00:25:41.590
Also, maybe if you go take a peek at the official hololive store, you'll also notice that there's some very exciting anime merch there too!

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:49.795
You know, if you want to remember this project forever and ever, please go and check it out there on the official hololive show!

00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:54.598
Now this is only chapter one, because Enryku is a long-term project.

00:25:54.838 --> 00:25:56.179
A long-term project, yeah.

00:25:56.219 --> 00:26:00.742
So it'll be going this entire week, the very first week of September here.

00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:08.067
So we hope that you'll join us all, all of hololive English, as we continue on our journey in the kingdom of Robusto.

00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:11.189
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:26:11.409 --> 00:26:12.989
Have you been enjoying it so far?

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:15.050
What do you think?

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.431
Oh, you want your own cape?

00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:21.812
That's only for heroes, Ruffians.

00:26:21.832 --> 00:26:24.453
You want your own cape, bitch?

00:26:24.713 --> 00:26:27.074
Are you saying you're not heroes?

00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:29.034
Lottery!

00:26:29.114 --> 00:26:30.335
Lottery!

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.095
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:33.756
It's not a lottery.

00:26:33.796 --> 00:26:35.396
You can get the merch without a lottery.

00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:36.577
Yeah, not lottery.

00:26:36.617 --> 00:26:36.937
Yeah.

00:26:38.183 --> 00:26:42.126
hololive means there's a little bit of a lot of it, but... Yeah.

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:43.687
Please go check it out!

00:26:44.427 --> 00:26:45.168
Ruffians!

00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:47.589
BAU BAU!

00:26:47.609 --> 00:26:52.112
Well, you know... A new week is here!

00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:53.893
A new month is here!

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:57.616
And well, there's a lot of things going on, Moco-chan.

00:26:58.156 --> 00:26:59.937
Ruffians, are you feeling okay?

00:26:59.977 --> 00:27:01.658
Are you ready for it?

00:27:02.479 --> 00:27:05.321
I don't know if the Ruffians are ready.

00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:07.362
Oh no, the new month just started.

00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:12.325
Ruffians!

00:27:12.906 --> 00:27:15.888
It's that time of the week again!

00:27:30.773 --> 00:27:31.353
It's time!

00:27:32.054 --> 00:27:32.334
Yes!

00:27:33.094 --> 00:27:34.255
You know what time it is!

00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:38.997
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:39.577 --> 00:27:41.938
And you're gonna hear it straight from me!

00:27:42.298 --> 00:27:42.679
Mococo!

00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:43.479
Ruffians.

00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:47.861
Ruffians!

00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:50.002
It's a new month!

00:27:50.822 --> 00:27:51.863
A new start!

00:27:52.943 --> 00:27:55.184
Did you do your best to enjoy the end of summer?

00:27:56.185 --> 00:27:58.026
Altered match potential high!

00:27:59.373 --> 00:28:04.243
I know, it can be scary having another change, a big new start to your year!

00:28:04.263 --> 00:28:09.575
But, sooner than later, it'll feel like your regular everyday once again.

00:28:11.115 --> 00:28:18.740
Do your best, but sometimes you need to know that no matter how hard you work, that things won't go your way.

00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:20.241
And that's okay.

00:28:20.982 --> 00:28:31.368
You know, even if you put 200% in, it shouldn't be just to get a certain result, but to also enjoy the journey together along the way there, okay?

00:28:32.049 --> 00:28:37.412
You know, that way, if you don't get the result you wanted, then it's not a huge disappointment, okay?

00:28:38.253 --> 00:28:43.717
Because it's just natural that sometimes things won't go as you hope or as you expect.

00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:45.278
And that's okay!

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:46.579
Got it!

00:28:49.862 --> 00:28:52.284
Let's continue to do our best no matter the result.

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:56.246
And don't forget to have fun along the way, okay?

00:28:56.287 --> 00:28:56.807
Ganbatte de!

00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:58.088
BAU BAU!

00:28:58.128 --> 00:28:58.828
BAU BAU!

00:29:05.594 --> 00:29:08.416
Ruffians, are you ready to go?

00:29:08.836 --> 00:29:10.317
Don't be scared, okay?

00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:11.198
You can do it!

00:29:11.538 --> 00:29:15.302
Even if things don't quite work out as you expect them to do.

00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:15.702
BAU BAU!

00:29:15.982 --> 00:29:20.206
It's been a little while!

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:20.586
Let's see!

00:29:23.248 --> 00:29:25.249
What the Doggie of the Day is today?

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:30.273
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:29:30.433 --> 00:29:33.275
It's Kona and Nao!

00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:35.156
Just like us, you know.

00:29:35.176 --> 00:29:38.138
Just a little different blue and red, right?

00:29:38.238 --> 00:29:41.720
Look at them, they're so fluffy.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.043
I don't know, much fuzzier maybe.

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.905
But Kona looks a little concerned right now.

00:29:50.466 --> 00:29:52.848
What's Noa up to something, huh?

00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:57.752
Maybe, maybe some teasing!

00:29:57.812 --> 00:30:01.536
Teasing fun.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.342
Let's give Noa the head pass, huh?

00:30:09.863 --> 00:30:10.443
MMC.

00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.866
Just how Kona bows bows.

00:30:14.627 --> 00:30:15.687
On the topic!

00:30:15.768 --> 00:30:18.170
How do they bow bow, Moco-chan?

00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:22.191
BAU BAU.

00:30:22.591 --> 00:30:23.192
BAU BAU.

00:30:23.212 --> 00:30:23.912
BAU BAU.

00:30:23.992 --> 00:30:24.452
BAU BAU.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.260
They look pretty identical.

00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:51.142
The faces look like they did something.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.123
You didn't notice the difference?

00:30:52.724 --> 00:30:54.045
I think Noah's up to something.

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:55.946
Check your ears, okay?

00:30:56.687 --> 00:31:02.512
Well, you know, I can tell Kona and Nao are best buddies that go everywhere together.

00:31:03.093 --> 00:31:03.433
Noah.

00:31:03.754 --> 00:31:04.254
Nao.

00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:06.356
Nao.

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:07.937
Nao.

00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:09.319
Yeah.

00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:12.842
Maybe they get into trouble and argue sometimes, but

00:31:13.942 --> 00:31:15.303
I can tell it doesn't last long.

00:31:15.383 --> 00:31:17.104
Kind of like us, right?

00:31:17.165 --> 00:31:18.125
Yeah.

00:31:18.786 --> 00:31:24.670
They're really good puppies and they're always happy to go for a walk together by your side.

00:31:25.371 --> 00:31:26.011
I know I am.

00:31:26.432 --> 00:31:29.494
Walks are always good.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.095
BAU BAU!

00:31:31.115 --> 00:31:34.418
Thank you for the endless BAU BAU!

00:31:39.093 --> 00:31:40.734
Have you been going on walks, Ruffians?

00:31:41.355 --> 00:31:42.736
We went on a walk!

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:44.057
I am Central Park.

00:31:44.077 --> 00:31:45.978
I don't have a penis.

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:49.501
Hold on, I know I get to go on a walk.

00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:51.102
Right.

00:31:52.423 --> 00:31:55.845
Well, let's see what you went on a walk with me, Ruffians!

00:31:55.925 --> 00:32:01.830
For today's I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.172
Woah, woah, woah, what is this?

00:32:07.945 --> 00:32:08.685
A river?

00:32:09.106 --> 00:32:10.446
It's amazing!

00:32:10.506 --> 00:32:11.126
Right!

00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:15.588
It kind of looks like... Hollow Summoner!

00:32:16.009 --> 00:32:16.489
Right!

00:32:17.089 --> 00:32:18.049
Night pool!

00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:19.270
So fancy!

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.491
I don't think it's a night pool.

00:32:21.511 --> 00:32:21.551
No.

00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:24.532
It's just a nice colorful river, right?

00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:28.314
It sort of looks like you could have a... ...adventure.

00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:32.096
I don't know.

00:32:32.476 --> 00:32:33.396
Is that just me?

00:32:33.476 --> 00:32:34.577
It's like an adventure.

00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:35.677
Yeah!

00:32:35.737 --> 00:32:36.217
Yeah!

00:32:36.237 --> 00:32:36.598
Yeah!

00:32:36.658 --> 00:32:37.038
Right!

00:32:38.235 --> 00:32:39.596
That's what I was thinking.

00:32:40.196 --> 00:32:40.676
I don't know.

00:32:40.796 --> 00:32:47.359
I don't think we're gonna see Marin-senpai and Jo-senpai come out of there in 4K all of a sudden.

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:48.399
No.

00:32:48.739 --> 00:32:48.979
No?

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:55.322
It's just, you know, something beautiful to look at at the end of your day, you know?

00:32:55.342 --> 00:32:57.143
At the end of the summer time, maybe?

00:32:57.203 --> 00:32:57.483
Yeah!

00:32:57.963 --> 00:33:02.005
Enjoy it while going on maybe your last summer night still alive.

00:33:02.025 --> 00:33:02.105
Yeah.

00:33:04.106 --> 00:33:05.930
BAU BAU!

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.376
Welcome to FUWAMOCO!

00:33:14.443 --> 00:33:16.285
BAU BAU!

00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:22.771
For our Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:24.032
Good day, FUWAMOCO!

00:33:24.092 --> 00:33:24.893
Good day!

00:33:25.453 --> 00:33:33.320
In Born to be Bound, there's a part where Mococo got silly and changed the song differently than what it was originally.

00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:36.783
What was supposed to be in that part of your song?

00:33:39.995 --> 00:33:41.256
Team Ruffians!

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:49.782
We both decided, you know, we're gonna sing a very cute, idly, very FUWAMOCO song, right?

00:33:50.382 --> 00:33:51.023
Right, you know?

00:33:51.463 --> 00:33:55.386
Maybe we're BAU BAU here, we're FUWAFUWA there, and MOCOMOCO there.

00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:55.846
But then!

00:33:55.866 --> 00:33:58.248
Moco-chan here had different plans.

00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:07.882
Had to throw in a heck time, huh?

00:34:09.262 --> 00:34:11.543
What's the deal, huh, Moco-chan?

00:34:12.403 --> 00:34:14.424
Ruffians!

00:34:15.544 --> 00:34:16.624
You love it, right?

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:18.605
Heck time!

00:34:19.325 --> 00:34:24.087
Heck yeah!

00:34:25.207 --> 00:34:26.788
I guess, Ruffians.

00:34:27.468 --> 00:34:34.690
If you like it, then it's good, but... I don't want anyone thinking that we're naughty puppies.

00:34:37.043 --> 00:34:37.683
Heck yeah!

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:39.064
Heck yeah!

00:34:39.184 --> 00:34:41.385
We're good demon guard dogs, right?

00:34:41.526 --> 00:34:42.806
Heck yeah!

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:47.209
BAU BAU!

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:48.950
Thank you so much!

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.051
Thank you for all your submissions!

00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:55.173
You are an important part of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:55.233 --> 00:34:55.894
We need you!

00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:59.876
So please, send us your demon guard dogs.

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:01.577
Oh my gosh, that's us.

00:35:02.077 --> 00:35:03.578
Actually, the Ruffians already do that.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.720
Huh?

00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:09.223
You send us screenshots all the time of certain pair of demon-glide dogs.
