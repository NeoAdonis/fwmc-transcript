05:13.122 --> 05:15.783
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:17.084 --> 05:20.726
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:21.066 --> 05:24.808
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:24.889 --> 05:27.850
BAU BAU BAU!

05:28.791 --> 05:31.612
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:31.732 --> 05:34.154
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:34.214 --> 05:36.175
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:36.215 --> 05:38.356
BAU BAU BAU!

05:39.236 --> 05:44.917
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:45.057 --> 05:46.138
Ruffians!

05:46.578 --> 05:49.898
It feels like it's been such a long time!

05:50.319 --> 05:52.639
BAU BAU!

05:52.659 --> 05:56.700
Thank you for joining us today for our 106th episode!

05:56.800 --> 05:59.741
BAU BAU!

05:59.761 --> 06:01.641
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:01.741 --> 06:02.981
It's been...

06:06.242 --> 06:09.344
It's been about a week since the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:11.265 --> 06:12.245
Wait!

06:12.305 --> 06:13.786
We did sing together!

06:13.866 --> 06:14.466
Yeah!

06:14.527 --> 06:16.888
Together with all of Advent.

06:17.108 --> 06:17.328
Yes!

06:17.588 --> 06:20.550
Oh well, we had some big announcements too.

06:20.590 --> 06:21.650
When was that though?

06:22.191 --> 06:24.312
It feels like forever ago!

06:24.412 --> 06:25.312
BAU!

06:25.332 --> 06:26.613
Ruffians!

06:27.554 --> 06:33.997
I definitely saw some Ruffians who said it's been a little while since they got to catch FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:34.037 --> 06:35.118
Maybe you forgot.

06:35.718 --> 06:50.348
But to explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning, and for those that are joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

06:50.788 --> 06:54.091
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:54.111 --> 06:59.414
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

07:00.595 --> 07:02.677
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

07:03.057 --> 07:05.960
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:06.180 --> 07:09.843
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:09.863 --> 07:13.746
BAU BAU!

07:14.327 --> 07:15.748
How many hashtags?

07:16.489 --> 07:17.850
Wait, what hashtag?

07:18.030 --> 07:24.235
Yeah, if you use two hashtags, the first one will just kind of sit there and look a little bit silly, Ruffians.

07:25.016 --> 07:26.218
Don't try it, okay?

07:26.238 --> 07:26.298
No.

07:26.358 --> 07:26.779
As in...

07:35.392 --> 07:36.953
90% of the time hot.

07:37.073 --> 07:41.554
I don't know why, but it's like that hot.

07:41.634 --> 07:45.716
Make sure you get Moco-chan to check over your tweet before you hit send, okay?

07:46.156 --> 07:46.876
I do my best.

07:49.017 --> 07:51.317
BAU BAU!

07:51.337 --> 07:56.379
Moco-chan, we just said something on the Ruffians, right?

08:00.621 --> 08:04.002
But it was bad news, so I was thinking about maybe not... Bad news?

08:04.967 --> 08:06.127
Not sharing?

08:08.048 --> 08:13.889
Well, sometimes, you know, reality is a little bit rough, but... We can't run away from it, Moco-chan!

08:14.949 --> 08:18.630
Well... Let's take a look at the reality.

08:18.650 --> 08:20.550
Anyways!

08:22.031 --> 08:23.411
Another Pero Sighting.

08:23.731 --> 08:25.951
BAU BAU!

08:26.371 --> 08:27.192
Let's take a look!

08:27.392 --> 08:30.132
Where was Pero seen this time, Ruffians?

08:31.973 --> 08:32.173
Oh!

08:32.413 --> 08:32.513
Oh!

08:33.293 --> 08:33.413
Oh!

08:35.718 --> 08:37.119
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

08:54.465 --> 08:59.767
It sort of looks like you melted in the summer heat into just one big... Pero pile.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.728
Pero puddle.

09:02.388 --> 09:04.529
Yeah, but... But why is Pero?

09:04.769 --> 09:08.891
Yeah, I don't think this open heart has anything to worry about, actually, Moco-chan.

09:08.911 --> 09:09.131
Why?

09:09.511 --> 09:11.712
I think, you know, this is just a piece of garbage.

09:13.173 --> 09:17.875
Yeah, well... You know, to be honest, whether it's garbage or actually Pero...

09:19.123 --> 09:19.983
In the end, you know.

09:20.563 --> 09:22.464
It's still garbage we're talking about, right?

09:23.284 --> 09:23.984
Right!

09:24.564 --> 09:25.944
Yeah, it's all garbage!

09:26.104 --> 09:28.025
It's just garbage.

09:29.105 --> 09:29.485
Yeah.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.005
Street pizza peril.

09:31.025 --> 09:33.646
This is a pizza you might want to avoid, then.

09:33.706 --> 09:34.386
Don't eat this one.

09:34.446 --> 09:35.986
As well as all the other pizza, too.

09:36.066 --> 09:36.346
Yeah.

09:36.366 --> 09:36.887
BAU BAU!

09:37.127 --> 09:41.067
It's too harsh!

09:41.708 --> 09:42.228
What?

09:42.748 --> 09:42.928
Rude!

09:44.308 --> 09:48.010
Ruffians.

09:48.570 --> 09:49.150
Nasty.

09:49.230 --> 09:50.410
Garbage is nasty.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.771
Pero is nasty.

09:52.171 --> 09:56.513
Pero is garbage.

09:56.873 --> 09:59.154
I'm not sure what kind of garbage this is either.

09:59.494 --> 10:02.635
Ruffians, do you have any good guesses?

10:04.816 --> 10:06.697
Maybe it's a bottle cap?

10:07.878 --> 10:09.779
Oh, it was a bottle cap.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.999
BAU BAU!

10:13.279 --> 10:14.140
A pancake?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.460
I don't think this is a pancake.

10:16.940 --> 10:17.300
Gum!

10:17.500 --> 10:20.201
I don't think it's gum.

10:20.941 --> 10:23.222
There's two little dots on it.

10:23.462 --> 10:24.782
Could be rocks, I guess.

10:24.982 --> 10:25.682
Ice cream.

10:25.722 --> 10:26.703
Plastic bag.

10:26.743 --> 10:27.263
A lid.

10:30.624 --> 10:31.104
Something.

10:31.264 --> 10:31.764
Something.

10:31.784 --> 10:32.385
A sticker?

10:32.785 --> 10:33.205
Maybe.

10:33.225 --> 10:35.426
It could be anything.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.168
Well, all we know is garbage.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.788
Yeah, we don't know what it is.

10:40.529 --> 10:42.570
BAU BAU!

10:43.050 --> 10:45.291
I guess that was probably the best Pero Sighting, huh?

10:45.611 --> 10:46.832
Because it wasn't really Pero.

10:47.635 --> 10:48.656
I guess it's true.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.377
Oh, it's like a jump scare, right?

10:53.519 --> 10:54.940
It's okay, it was just garbage.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.241
It was just garbage!

10:56.261 --> 10:57.121
What's that?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.223
Oh, it was just a leaf.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.183
Oh, what's that?

11:00.303 --> 11:01.204
Oh, it's just my hair.

11:01.604 --> 11:03.165
You know, just like that.

11:04.726 --> 11:07.648
BAU BAU!

11:07.868 --> 11:10.809
This definitely was not a jump scare, was it?

11:11.329 --> 11:14.051
It was a little bit of a jump scare for me too, but!

11:14.151 --> 11:22.955
Well, Ruffians, you know, we were actually live over on Nerissa's channel together with Advent, and we had a little bit of a collab.

11:23.435 --> 11:25.976
We teamed up all together!

11:26.016 --> 11:29.018
But, not just that, there was a huge

11:30.719 --> 11:31.801
Advent.

11:32.422 --> 11:41.374
Our 3D debut dates were announced!

11:42.376 --> 11:43.197
Exciting!

11:43.277 --> 11:43.898
Exciting!

11:46.001 --> 11:47.923
27 days?

11:48.163 --> 11:49.886
Are you sure it's 27 days?

11:49.946 --> 11:52.449
I'm pretty sure it's like a week.

11:52.649 --> 11:55.292
I see a lot of Ruffians saying, oh it's so far away.

11:55.332 --> 11:55.993
It's not.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.214
Are you sure about that?

11:57.294 --> 11:59.657
Are you taking BAU time into account here?

11:59.717 --> 12:00.278
Yeah.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.420
This is a week at most.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.402
It's a week away.

12:03.962 --> 12:04.503
Okay.

12:05.084 --> 12:05.364
Yeah.

12:06.823 --> 12:08.884
Think about the BAU time, Mocchi!

12:08.904 --> 12:13.447
But we're so nervous, Mocchi!

12:13.927 --> 12:16.789
To be honest, we're so nervous.

12:18.029 --> 12:22.712
We would probably rather debut again in hololive five times over.

12:22.752 --> 12:23.132
Yeah.

12:23.272 --> 12:23.612
Yeah.

12:25.822 --> 12:26.722
We're really nervous.

12:26.823 --> 12:28.543
Yeah, that's how nervous we are.

12:29.364 --> 12:34.326
Yeah, but to start off the 3D debuts, we have Shiori!

12:34.866 --> 12:37.487
On the second act in PMPT.

12:37.587 --> 12:40.188
And then, now, uh, Biboo!

12:40.208 --> 12:40.909
On the next day!

12:41.169 --> 12:42.389
It's a bit confusing, huh?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.430
Yeah, on the next day.

12:44.690 --> 12:49.953
I don't know, after a week goes by, the next weekend we have Nerissa!

12:49.973 --> 12:50.773
And then!

12:51.393 --> 12:54.334
FUWAMOCO on the 10th at 8pm!

12:54.635 --> 12:56.115
But that's not it!

12:56.135 --> 12:56.175
No!

12:57.056 --> 13:00.757
We still have the Advent collab!

13:00.857 --> 13:03.398
On the 17th, all of us all together!

13:03.418 --> 13:05.519
Yeah, but Ruffians!

13:05.939 --> 13:10.782
You can't believe how hard we've been practicing and dreaming for this!

13:11.042 --> 13:11.502
Yeah...

13:12.465 --> 13:15.047
Oh, there's been so many sweats.

13:15.107 --> 13:15.387
Sweats?

13:15.488 --> 13:16.628
So many sweats!

13:16.789 --> 13:17.709
So many sweats!

13:17.829 --> 13:20.131
So many... liters of sweat!

13:20.632 --> 13:20.792
No!

13:21.412 --> 13:21.532
What?!

13:21.612 --> 13:23.414
Liters of tears!

13:23.754 --> 13:24.575
Gallons of love!

13:24.595 --> 13:25.495
Liters of tears!

13:27.057 --> 13:28.158
Not that many tears.

13:28.678 --> 13:31.200
At least a couple bottles of tears.

13:32.881 --> 13:36.244
Yeah, and that's just so far, Ruffians.

13:36.424 --> 13:36.925
Yeah.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.586
Liters of love.

13:39.621 --> 13:40.642
I'm nervous, Moco-chan.

14:01.615 --> 14:02.576
We'll be okay!

14:02.656 --> 14:06.797
We'll do our best, okay!

14:06.857 --> 14:13.741
Please be there cheering for all our Advent doing each and every one of our debuts and being as loud as possible!

14:13.761 --> 14:15.661
Make sure you use the hashtags.

14:16.002 --> 14:17.762
Hashtag Shiorin3D.

14:17.782 --> 14:19.143
Don't forget the N, okay?

14:19.163 --> 14:20.844
Hashtag Biboo3D, not Bijou3D.

14:20.944 --> 14:21.384
Biboo3D.

14:21.404 --> 14:21.984
Hashtag 3DemonDebut.

14:29.848 --> 14:31.749
And hashtag FWMC3D.

14:31.789 --> 14:32.810
Yeah.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.071
Got it?

14:34.471 --> 14:34.731
Yeah.

14:35.111 --> 14:35.772
Okay!

14:35.792 --> 14:36.972
BAU BAU!

14:37.573 --> 14:39.034
Oh, Advent 3D.

14:39.054 --> 14:39.954
Yeah.

14:40.274 --> 14:42.256
Don't forget that one too, okay?

14:43.076 --> 14:46.098
BAU BAU!

14:46.138 --> 14:47.259
BAU BAU!

14:47.299 --> 14:49.260
Make sure, okay, that you'll be there.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.201
Yeah.

14:50.241 --> 14:51.121
Who's Bijou?

14:51.161 --> 14:52.162
He's Bijou, right?

14:52.262 --> 14:54.623
Even mama puppy's like, Biboo.

14:54.964 --> 14:55.324
Biboo!

14:58.966 --> 14:59.446
Bijou.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.747
She's Koseki Bijou.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.427
Koseki Bijou.

15:03.927 --> 15:04.308
Biboo.

15:04.868 --> 15:09.890
BAU BAU!

15:10.050 --> 15:13.231
Don't forget to put it in your calendars.

15:13.271 --> 15:16.412
Maybe there's some Ruffians that don't have calendars.

15:16.712 --> 15:19.573
You could just take a pen and write it on your paw too.

15:19.713 --> 15:21.074
Or try to remember.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.461
BAU BAU!

15:25.621 --> 15:29.322
And well, FUWAMOCO, there's been a lot going on.

15:29.782 --> 15:32.703
You know hololive, there's been so many amazing announcements.

15:32.803 --> 15:38.605
Most recently there was the hololive world tour that was announced that's going on.

15:39.345 --> 15:44.387
But completely separate, actually, we realized that us, FUWAMOCO,

15:46.053 --> 15:50.238
We've kinda been doing our own world tour without us even realizing it!

15:50.598 --> 15:51.619
Yeah!

15:51.639 --> 15:52.120
Yeah!

15:52.220 --> 15:53.101
Where is she now?

15:53.181 --> 15:54.883
Yeah, you know FUWAMOCO.

15:56.184 --> 15:59.748
Just this summer alone, you know, we had the honor of performing in Taipei.

15:59.808 --> 16:01.410
Taipei!

16:01.870 --> 16:04.413
In LA, Los Angeles!

16:08.445 --> 16:08.925
BAU BAU!

16:09.046 --> 16:18.635
And then we were at Japan Expo in Paris!

16:19.076 --> 16:21.859
And then just coming up really soon we're gonna be in

16:22.279 --> 16:22.779
Sydney!

16:22.799 --> 16:24.640
New York City!

16:24.660 --> 16:24.980
Ruffians!

16:40.628 --> 16:42.570
Cities to go and visit!

16:42.650 --> 16:43.971
Ruffians to see!

16:45.252 --> 16:47.654
Japan Expo last week in Paris!

16:47.915 --> 16:49.816
You know, it was so much fun!

16:50.097 --> 16:52.118
You're absolutely amazing!

16:52.238 --> 16:55.081
Everyone was jumping and dancing and energetic!

16:55.121 --> 16:56.642
BAU BAUing along with us!

16:56.763 --> 16:59.885
And you know we got to use our French as much as we could too!

17:00.426 --> 17:03.468
But maybe we went a bit overboard, FUWAMOCO-chan.

17:03.488 --> 17:04.790
Maybe.

17:05.170 --> 17:05.871
Sometimes!

17:07.832 --> 17:10.875
I think it was hard for everyone to understand what we were saying.

17:10.895 --> 17:13.277
FUWAMOCO, transfer!

17:13.318 --> 17:14.679
Transfer!

17:25.055 --> 17:26.197
I'm FUWAMOCO!

17:26.818 --> 17:27.579
I'm Mococo!

17:27.599 --> 17:28.160
I'm Mococo!

17:28.180 --> 17:28.480
BAU BAU.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.286
You're so good at French!

17:42.139 --> 17:43.240
Meshiboku.

17:45.442 --> 17:46.082
BAU BAU.

17:46.102 --> 17:47.763
Yeah, I think we overused it.

17:47.843 --> 17:49.185
Yeah, we went overboard.

17:49.385 --> 17:56.911
But it's okay because this upcoming weekend, you know, we're gonna be in a smash in Australia!

17:57.291 --> 17:59.793
And, uh, that's English.

18:00.453 --> 18:01.274
Good day, me!

18:03.315 --> 18:08.459
Yeah, we're gonna do our best in our Australia too!

18:08.620 --> 18:09.580
What else do you know?

18:13.008 --> 18:13.589
What?

18:14.471 --> 18:16.394
I don't know what all this is.

18:16.815 --> 18:17.617
Makaij.

18:17.677 --> 18:18.118
Makaij.

18:18.278 --> 18:20.402
I'm gonna shake them up.

18:20.602 --> 18:21.364
What?

18:21.424 --> 18:22.105
Makaij.

18:24.933 --> 18:29.157
It's time for FUWAMOCO, right?

18:29.438 --> 18:32.120
Shunpon the barbie, that sounds yummy.

18:32.801 --> 18:35.083
Barbie is barbecue, right?

18:35.984 --> 18:41.609
I don't think this on my soul is something we need to know for Smash.

18:41.629 --> 18:42.690
They may be like, huh?

18:42.870 --> 18:45.533
Yeah, just like in Japan.

18:46.402 --> 18:48.404
We don't want to repeat that, right, Moco-chan?

18:48.524 --> 18:52.227
Yeah, but we're really looking forward to Smash.

18:52.287 --> 18:58.912
Especially, you know, we'll be able to talk closely with some very lucky Ruffians, too!

18:58.932 --> 19:00.774
So excited!

19:00.874 --> 19:04.417
We just had so much fun already, just BAU BAUing all together.

19:07.120 --> 19:16.079
You know, hopefully we can go to even more places around the world and you know, that way maybe if we haven't had the chance to visit near you yet, we can

19:17.621 --> 19:20.623
Hope to see you sometime soon!

19:21.183 --> 19:21.643
Okay.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.304
Got it.

19:22.344 --> 19:25.886
So please let your local event organizers know that you wanna see us!

19:25.926 --> 19:28.808
See FUWAMOCO at your event too, okay?

19:28.828 --> 19:32.230
Thank you, Ruffians!

19:32.290 --> 19:36.772
The unexpected FUWAMOCO World Tour continues!

19:36.812 --> 19:37.633
BAU BAU!

19:39.373 --> 19:40.534
Thank you, Ruffians!

19:40.874 --> 19:45.576
New York City breaking dimensions!

19:45.656 --> 19:50.718
We're gonna break down!

19:51.258 --> 19:52.199
BAU BAU!

19:52.259 --> 20:00.422
Ruffians, you know, maybe you've been even busier than FUWAMOCO, and this chance you didn't hear the other big noise.

20:01.022 --> 20:02.703
But, FUWAMOCO!

20:02.723 --> 20:12.050
At the Anime Expo Good Smile Parlor, it was announced that FUWAMOCO Nendoroids are in development!

20:12.110 --> 20:14.111
BAU BAU!

20:14.672 --> 20:15.832
Not just that, Moco-chan!

20:15.853 --> 20:18.715
Not just that, but POP UP 3 figures of us too!

20:18.755 --> 20:19.235
BAU BAU!

20:22.177 --> 20:23.957
We're so excited!

20:24.138 --> 20:28.900
It really means so much to us as huge fans of figures and, you know, good smiles.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.161
Words, figures, Nandroid.

20:31.801 --> 20:33.422
All of them.

20:33.562 --> 20:35.923
We just can't wait to get our paws on them!

20:36.023 --> 20:37.984
Yeah!

20:38.084 --> 20:39.345
Yeah, I need them now!

20:39.385 --> 20:40.605
We're gonna have to be patient.

20:40.645 --> 20:41.626
You're getting them all!

20:41.806 --> 20:43.106
I'm gonna get them all too!

20:43.407 --> 20:45.668
But we haven't talked about how many we need.

20:46.608 --> 20:49.389
Oh, well we talked about how many the Ruffians need, right?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.610
But how many do we need?

20:51.070 --> 20:52.851
Oh, that's another question entirely.

20:54.031 --> 20:55.412
Uh-oh.

20:56.152 --> 21:01.794
Ruffians, what kind of silly expressions and accessories do you think they'll have on their heads?

21:02.374 --> 21:04.095
We wanna know what you're imagining!

21:04.115 --> 21:06.096
Sneeze face!

21:06.716 --> 21:08.357
What is my sneeze face?

21:10.610 --> 21:12.792
That goes without saying.

21:12.832 --> 21:17.816
What is my sneeze face?

21:17.856 --> 21:18.497
Is it this?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.859
That's your sleeping face.

21:22.180 --> 21:22.900
There it is!

21:22.980 --> 21:23.721
There it is!

21:23.741 --> 21:25.342
Sneeze face.

21:25.422 --> 21:27.884
Is that it?

21:27.924 --> 21:29.145
That's all.

21:30.186 --> 21:30.827
Apparel?

21:31.027 --> 21:31.607
No way.

21:31.727 --> 21:32.228
No way.

21:32.248 --> 21:33.449
Nendoroids aren't nasty.

21:33.529 --> 21:35.751
You don't get garbage with a nendoroid.

21:35.811 --> 21:36.731
No, no, no.

21:36.811 --> 21:37.072
Yeah.

21:37.808 --> 21:38.329
Uh-oh.

21:39.570 --> 21:42.753
We want to know what you're imagining, Ruffians!

21:43.353 --> 21:44.574
Let us know again!

21:44.594 --> 21:50.860
You'll definitely need to make sure that you have your camera ready to take photos when we get into your paws, too.

21:50.980 --> 21:56.365
You know, maybe we'll see more doggy of the days with Nanjoy, FUWAMOCO included.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.226
Maybe.

21:58.246 --> 22:00.769
Maybe we'll get to be in the doggy of the days fluff.

22:02.770 --> 22:03.111
Melt melt.

22:03.898 --> 22:04.178
BAU BAU!

22:20.086 --> 22:30.590
Ruffians, also you know that FUWAMOCO was busy being sick with food poisoning and kinda stuck in bed.

22:30.610 --> 22:35.312
There are some new voice packs that were released!

22:35.512 --> 22:39.354
This time, Tanabata themed!

22:39.474 --> 22:42.055
Tanabata themed voice packs!

22:42.075 --> 22:44.836
Ruffians, are you familiar with Tanabata?

22:44.856 --> 22:46.637
Do you know what it is?

22:48.162 --> 22:50.303
I always kind of forget a little bit myself.

22:51.183 --> 22:52.183
Ikeri did before.

22:52.203 --> 22:53.063
You like that?

22:53.163 --> 22:53.903
A bit, a bit.

22:54.043 --> 22:54.924
No, you don't know.

22:54.944 --> 22:55.024
Yeah.

22:55.244 --> 22:55.604
Wow.

22:55.744 --> 22:58.584
Tanabata, it's a star festival.

22:58.925 --> 23:03.566
And it celebrates the once a year meeting of the deities and lovers.

23:03.766 --> 23:06.606
Hikoboshi-sama and Orihime-sama.

23:06.646 --> 23:12.008
You know, and everyone writes their wishes on tons of paper slips and hangs them up on bamboo.

23:12.028 --> 23:14.028
Yeah, it's just really, really sweet.

23:14.468 --> 23:17.130
It's a nice festival that's very hopeful.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.152
They only meet that one time in the year.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.213
Yeah, that's why it's so special.

23:21.754 --> 23:23.014
Very romantic.

23:23.034 --> 23:23.895
FUWAMOCO!

23:24.115 --> 23:29.499
We recorded some really cute voice packs around it, so please check them out!

23:29.539 --> 23:39.046
Yeah, you can even hear samples, like one-minute samples of our voice packs in both English and Japanese on the hololive production official song!

23:39.146 --> 23:39.326
Shop!

23:39.346 --> 23:39.446
Shop!

23:41.035 --> 23:46.458
Yeah, you know, Tanabata Day is kind of a long, long, long kind of day to start.

23:46.498 --> 23:50.800
Well, if you're interested, maybe going on a date together with Moco-chan.

23:50.841 --> 23:52.782
Yeah, in a yukata.

23:52.902 --> 23:56.584
And Fuwawawa, I'm in a maid outfit!

23:56.844 --> 23:59.505
It doesn't seem very Tanabata-themed, huh?

24:00.026 --> 24:03.808
It's Tanabata Day-themed, so you won't want to miss it, okay?

24:03.928 --> 24:05.228
A maid outfit!

24:05.529 --> 24:05.969
A maid outfit.

24:08.168 --> 24:10.309
I'm gonna wear a maid outfit.

24:10.710 --> 24:14.832
Maid outfits work for any situation.

24:14.852 --> 24:22.096
Even though FUWAMOCO, the paws have been hitting the pavement very hard.

24:23.157 --> 24:28.740
Things have been busy, but even us, we were able to take a little moment to celebrate Tanabata too.

24:28.921 --> 24:33.703
You know we wrote special tanzaku for Shirakei Tanabata stream.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.604
You wanna see them?

24:34.624 --> 24:35.425
Wait, no.

24:36.633 --> 24:43.098
We also had personal tanzaku that we shared with Mane-chan and staff.

24:43.118 --> 24:44.399
We wrote down.

24:44.559 --> 24:48.042
And then we're like, okay, we're gonna take a photo for memories.

24:48.522 --> 24:50.204
And then we're like, Mane-chan, look!

24:50.704 --> 24:52.626
These puppies are hungry!

24:52.646 --> 24:55.868
Staff, look at our tanzaku, hi!

24:55.928 --> 24:57.830
This is our tanzaku, hi!

24:57.870 --> 24:57.930
Hi!

25:00.772 --> 25:03.214
We have lots of dreams, right?

25:04.155 --> 25:06.277
BAU BAU!

25:06.317 --> 25:10.220
We hope you had a wonderful Tanabata!

25:10.240 --> 25:12.522
BAU BAU!

25:12.542 --> 25:15.864
A date with Moco-chan!

25:15.924 --> 25:16.525
Yukata date.

25:16.545 --> 25:17.145
Tanabata date.

25:17.165 --> 25:17.526
Voice part.

25:24.130 --> 25:28.172
If you just go to the hololive production official site, there's a one minute sample!

25:28.393 --> 25:30.614
One minute sample is a lot.

25:30.634 --> 25:33.796
That's like a, you get a one minute date with Moco-chan then.

25:34.236 --> 25:37.338
For free!

25:37.398 --> 25:38.959
Whatever, Fuwama-chu!

25:39.099 --> 25:40.320
Fuwama-chu, yeah!

25:40.540 --> 25:41.221
BAU BAU!

25:42.341 --> 25:44.423
BAU BAU!

25:44.443 --> 25:49.746
Well you know, like I said, the paws are visiting the pavement.

25:49.766 --> 25:50.586
And, uh,

25:52.017 --> 25:53.018
I'm still a little bit tired.

25:53.058 --> 25:56.521
You know, we've been working really hard and practicing a ton.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.704
Singing, dancing, over and over and over and over.

25:59.844 --> 26:02.326
So you know, we're a bit sore.

26:02.346 --> 26:02.706
Yeah.

26:03.367 --> 26:04.528
Kinda sore puppies.

26:04.608 --> 26:04.968
Yeah.

26:05.028 --> 26:08.291
You know, sometimes practices go from morning to night.

26:08.311 --> 26:09.812
Yeah.

26:09.852 --> 26:14.957
We've never got massages before, but I feel like if there is a time,

26:17.364 --> 26:18.946
That would be nice.

26:18.966 --> 26:23.651
Fuwawa does her best to massage you, but her paws get sore quickly.

26:23.671 --> 26:28.536
Yeah, Moco-chan is like, Fuwawa, can you just kind of like punch here?

26:29.017 --> 26:29.657
There, there, there.

26:29.677 --> 26:29.978
No, no, down.

26:30.018 --> 26:30.198
Down.

26:30.238 --> 26:30.438
Yeah.

26:30.478 --> 26:30.698
Down.

26:33.941 --> 26:34.782
There, there, there, there.

26:34.802 --> 26:39.024
It's okay, but then it becomes a bother really quickly because she's picky.

26:39.044 --> 26:41.505
I'm just trying to help.

26:41.585 --> 26:46.567
But, I don't know, Ruffians, like, going to get massages is like a normal thing, right?

26:46.647 --> 26:48.488
But, I don't, I don't, is it a normal thing?

26:48.528 --> 26:49.329
I don't think so.

26:49.349 --> 26:57.273
Just, the idea of maybe somebody that don't know touching the floor from the first, it's just a little bit too much.

26:57.353 --> 26:58.193
It's a bit much, huh?

26:58.233 --> 26:58.833
Yeah.

26:58.853 --> 26:59.414
You know, I think,

27:00.314 --> 27:05.637
My muscles might just tense up and get a bit more stressed and relaxing, huh?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.218
It's an old person thing.

27:07.238 --> 27:08.960
I wouldn't know.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.821
Have y'all ever gotten a massage of Ruffians?

27:14.363 --> 27:14.843
I don't know.

27:15.564 --> 27:17.125
Most people don't get massages.

27:17.325 --> 27:19.446
Did you do something to prepare if you did?

27:20.006 --> 27:20.647
I don't know.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.908
You get them every week?

27:22.928 --> 27:23.989
Oh my goodness.

27:24.069 --> 27:24.709
Really?

27:24.729 --> 27:26.170
Wow, brave.

27:27.968 --> 27:28.808
Yeah, I don't know.

27:28.828 --> 27:31.689
I think that your back needs one.

27:32.009 --> 27:33.630
I hope it feels better soon.

27:33.790 --> 27:34.530
Yeah.

27:34.891 --> 27:35.571
I don't know though.

27:35.651 --> 27:45.474
I think like, if I imagine us trying to get a massage, I think we might just end up being ticklish or laughing or even just running away midway.

27:45.654 --> 27:48.556
I just, I really want to get a scalp massage someday though.

27:48.876 --> 27:49.916
I feel like it's different.

27:50.156 --> 27:53.017
You just gotta make sure that the ears, no touch the ears.

27:53.037 --> 27:53.377
No, no, no.

27:53.397 --> 27:53.557
Yeah.

27:56.346 --> 27:59.267
You know, I'm sort of worried that I might get a headache after.

27:59.287 --> 28:01.567
Because that's usually what happens, huh?

28:01.667 --> 28:03.068
Yeah.

28:03.128 --> 28:08.169
But Nerissa has been kind of talking about wanting a massage too recently, right?

28:08.189 --> 28:12.050
So maybe we can go together or something and then it won't be so scary?

28:12.090 --> 28:12.510
Yeah!

28:13.390 --> 28:16.431
We'll have to see!

28:16.491 --> 28:22.733
But, you know, I do think it's kind of about time that FUWAMOCO maybe take a moment to get a breath of fresh air.

28:24.213 --> 28:24.574
Mia.

28:24.976 --> 28:26.219
BAU BAU!

28:31.918 --> 28:33.219
BAU BAU!

28:33.239 --> 28:40.985
Wow, you know, Moco-chan, it's a new week, but there's no natto challenge.

28:41.445 --> 28:43.186
Doggie of the Day!

28:44.747 --> 28:48.310
Make sure you challenge yourself this week, okay?

28:48.910 --> 28:50.211
What Doggie of the Day?

28:50.251 --> 28:52.233
Let's take a look at today's Doggie of the Day.

28:52.253 --> 28:56.796
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Destiny!

28:57.817 --> 28:58.818
Destiny!

28:58.858 --> 29:01.000
She's so cute, she looks like a stuffed animal.

29:01.080 --> 29:01.501
Right?

29:01.541 --> 29:03.122
Look at those little eyes.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.624
But she's not a stuffed animal.

29:05.024 --> 29:07.867
She's Destiny!

29:08.188 --> 29:12.592
Well Destiny, apparently she can be a little bit of a pain in the tail.

29:13.233 --> 29:14.213
BAU BAU!

29:34.241 --> 29:37.264
Destiny is cute, but also a pain.

29:53.690 --> 29:54.971
Sounds very accurate, though.

29:54.991 --> 29:55.752
Destiny can be a pain!

29:55.892 --> 29:56.953
Right, you know!

29:57.573 --> 29:57.913
Yeah.

29:58.154 --> 30:00.716
Destiny's sometimes nice, sometimes also a pain.

30:01.176 --> 30:01.396
Yeah.

30:01.977 --> 30:02.397
Accurate.

30:03.238 --> 30:14.346
But, uh, I might kind of have heard, you know, kind of heard around, though, that if you give her lots of head pats and attention, that she'll be less of a bother.

30:14.366 --> 30:15.727
Or cuddly, though.

30:15.827 --> 30:16.428
Maybe.

30:16.988 --> 30:17.749
Yes, maybe.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.631
Yeah, not like we know anything, though.

30:21.032 --> 30:21.292
No, no.

30:22.003 --> 30:26.294
BAU BAU!

30:26.434 --> 30:28.058
And next morning!

30:28.359 --> 30:30.364
Let's see where you've been going on the logs.

30:31.372 --> 30:31.712
De-den!

30:31.792 --> 30:35.994
How many sculptures of dogs are on it too? 27!

30:53.560 --> 30:54.320
Oh my gosh!

30:54.840 --> 30:56.001
And real dogs too!

30:56.021 --> 30:57.621
There's lots of dogs.

30:57.641 --> 30:58.521
Sculptures of dogs!

30:58.661 --> 30:59.622
Real dogs!

31:00.302 --> 31:03.663
But it sounds like we need to visit there too, you know.

31:03.743 --> 31:05.223
The resident demon dog!

31:05.243 --> 31:06.003
Right!

31:06.063 --> 31:06.843
Yeah!

31:07.443 --> 31:09.664
It looks so pretty though!

31:09.724 --> 31:10.704
I wanna jump in!

31:11.164 --> 31:16.906
But Moco-chan, if we do that again, you know, we might get put in the cell for mischief.

31:18.846 --> 31:19.486
Ruffians.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.227
Do you think he's okay?

31:27.225 --> 31:27.765
It was worth it.

31:27.805 --> 31:28.726
Be extra sneaky.

31:31.047 --> 31:32.327
Go back to the cell!

31:32.987 --> 31:33.268
No!

31:33.288 --> 31:37.829
We'll just have to... Don't get caught.

31:38.210 --> 31:38.910
Don't get caught.

31:39.727 --> 31:43.888
BAU BAU!

31:43.948 --> 31:46.049
Next we have our Question of the Day!

31:46.069 --> 31:49.970
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

31:50.390 --> 31:53.651
Rewatching FUWAMOCO Morning 31!

31:53.711 --> 31:56.351
Since 106, quite a number of FUWAMOCO Mornings ago.

31:56.391 --> 31:57.752
We know it's you, Ruffians.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.672
Rewatching old episodes!

31:59.732 --> 32:00.993
Thank you!

32:01.613 --> 32:05.774
Rewatching FUWAMOCO Morning 31 again was nostalgic and energizing.

32:06.154 --> 32:09.395
It told us that former doghouse lighting was running out.

32:09.615 --> 32:12.722
Ran out of hope after the fourth ball went out.

32:12.742 --> 32:15.910
I wonder what the lighting's gonna say.

32:18.452 --> 32:22.175
The lighting situation is like in the current doghouse in Japan.

32:22.635 --> 32:25.457
I sure hope they're going well today.

32:25.537 --> 32:26.618
Going strong.

32:26.638 --> 32:26.758
Strong!

32:27.479 --> 32:28.159
Yeah.

32:29.060 --> 32:30.181
Ah, that's right, though.

32:30.201 --> 32:33.123
We had a lot of problems with the light bulbs, right?

32:33.683 --> 32:34.324
We did.

32:34.344 --> 32:38.687
Well, currently, this doghouse has very good light bulbs.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.628
Probably.

32:39.908 --> 32:42.230
No lighting situation, okay?

32:42.650 --> 32:44.992
Lighting's exciting, but... No, lighting!

32:45.412 --> 32:46.513
Lighting's not exciting.

32:46.753 --> 32:48.774
But important.

32:49.234 --> 32:53.016
Yeah, and the light bulbs are very good, so we have not thought about it.

32:53.036 --> 32:57.078
I'd like to inform you though that we also do not have a ladder.

32:57.558 --> 33:01.299
So when it does become a problem, it will be a problem.

33:01.339 --> 33:01.820
Yeah.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.421
I don't know where to get a ladder.

33:06.061 --> 33:07.162
We'll get there when we get there.

33:09.317 --> 33:11.479
BAU BAU!

33:29.998 --> 33:33.181
Ah, so many things we need to acquire, Mr. Moco-chan.

33:33.741 --> 33:34.903
The quest continues.

33:35.703 --> 33:36.604
BAU BAU!

33:36.644 --> 33:44.552
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions, your Doggie of the Day, your questions, your walks, your Pero Sightings.

33:44.873 --> 33:45.654
Please, please!

33:46.174 --> 33:48.595
Please send us some if you see Pero around.

33:48.775 --> 33:49.715
Use the hashtag!

33:49.815 --> 33:51.216
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

33:51.236 --> 33:52.516
Don't forget it!

33:52.636 --> 33:57.978
You're an important part of FUWAMOCO Morning, so we're always waiting, okay?

33:57.998 --> 33:59.018
We're waiting!

33:59.519 --> 34:01.379
BAU BAU!

34:02.620 --> 34:05.280
And we have our next stream coming up.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.621
We have De-den!

34:08.669 --> 34:13.715
Ruffians, it's been a long time since we chatted.

34:13.735 --> 34:16.678
And there's some Super Chats that we also wanna read.

34:16.698 --> 34:18.881
We wanna read all your Super Chats!

34:19.241 --> 34:22.245
So we're gonna have a really, really fun time.

34:23.205 --> 34:27.907
Just being able to, you know, have a cozy, comfy chatting time.

34:28.267 --> 34:28.867
Yeah, right!

34:28.887 --> 34:30.788
We really, really need it, right?

34:30.808 --> 34:32.769
So many things!

34:32.869 --> 34:34.049
It might be a bit long.

34:34.109 --> 34:35.770
Yeah, no more food poisoning.

34:35.930 --> 34:38.051
Oh my goodness, no.

34:38.391 --> 34:38.891
Yeah.

34:39.992 --> 34:43.553
I just eat simple things like... Mugamame.

34:44.893 --> 34:45.854
Grapes.

34:46.814 --> 34:47.474
Grapes!

34:47.955 --> 34:48.195
Yeah.

34:49.055 --> 34:49.935
BAU BAU!

34:49.995 --> 34:51.036
BAU BAU!

34:51.116 --> 34:51.776
I'm pondering.

34:53.994 --> 34:55.255
BAU BAU!

34:55.756 --> 34:58.519
And Ruffians, let's take a look at our schedule!

34:58.559 --> 35:02.944
We released a new schedule, but we haven't been able to introduce it to you yet.

35:03.044 --> 35:04.346
Our schedule!

35:04.506 --> 35:04.686
De-den!

35:04.706 --> 35:08.571
You might notice there's a little bit of an update at the bottom.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.413
Nothing to be concerned about yet.

35:33.547 --> 35:38.449
Wednesday, we have another FUWAMOCO Morning together!

35:38.749 --> 35:41.770
And in the evening, some Donkey Kong Country too!

35:41.830 --> 35:43.611
Let's see how this nest is doing.

35:44.051 --> 35:45.312
I'm very confident in it.

35:45.452 --> 35:47.653
I'm sure it's good.

35:48.553 --> 35:53.977
Thursday morning, early morning at 4am PT, we're gonna be playing Chain together.

35:54.017 --> 35:57.360
Yeah, we wanted to play, but there was no other time.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.401
Yeah, we really wanted to play.

35:59.421 --> 36:07.587
Ruffians, we wanna be able to spend as much time together as possible, but we do know that maybe some Ruffians will be deep asleep then.

36:07.727 --> 36:08.247
Yeah.

36:08.287 --> 36:08.508
So...

36:09.148 --> 36:15.391
But we hope you know we can spend a little bit more time together and I know if you're gonna sleep, sleep then!

36:15.431 --> 36:18.132
Then maybe you can check it out later when you're awake.

36:18.172 --> 36:18.372
Yeah.

36:18.712 --> 36:21.293
I know maybe needing a couple BAU BAUs here.

36:21.333 --> 36:22.514
What happened to Portal?!

36:23.014 --> 36:23.634
Don't worry!

36:24.375 --> 36:25.115
It will be back.

36:26.595 --> 36:27.156
Very soon.

36:27.536 --> 36:28.116
Very soon.

36:28.856 --> 36:29.797
Probably August.

36:30.877 --> 36:31.618
I hope sooner.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.398
Hopefully sooner.

36:33.859 --> 36:34.059
Okay.

36:35.407 --> 36:36.407
Thank you, Ruffians.

36:36.667 --> 36:41.108
It might be a little bit of a wait, but it will be back.

36:41.768 --> 36:42.448
It will be back.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.069
I want to play Portal 2 together.

36:44.109 --> 36:47.269
There's a lot of stuff coming, okay?

36:47.369 --> 36:48.290
A lot of stuff.

36:48.990 --> 36:57.751
It sounds silly, Ruffians, but there's a lot of things, exciting things that we want to do together that we have to do at a certain time.

36:57.971 --> 36:59.992
Portal 2 is so crazy, okay?

37:02.306 --> 37:03.427
BAU BAU.

37:03.727 --> 37:07.048
And then we have an advent collab together!

37:07.288 --> 37:12.430
We're gonna be chatting all about Japan and experiences so far.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.770
Being silly.

37:14.290 --> 37:16.031
And it's on Nerissa's channel.

37:16.191 --> 37:17.511
Nerissa's channel!

37:17.951 --> 37:22.613
And I didn't mention anything, but there might be an announcement too!

37:22.693 --> 37:23.133
Maybe?

37:23.153 --> 37:23.233
Yeah!

37:23.693 --> 37:24.113
So?

37:26.518 --> 37:29.581
Please join us, it'll be very comfy.

37:30.682 --> 37:38.168
And now that we're awake, it's the summer of Advent after all!

37:38.429 --> 37:41.591
And the Friday morning is FUWAMOCO Morning!

37:41.972 --> 37:46.876
And a little bit different than usual, we have a Rock n' Rawr Party on the Friday!

37:47.677 --> 37:48.938
Rock n' Rawr Party!

37:49.238 --> 37:50.219
It's BAU!

37:51.720 --> 37:52.581
We can't wait!

37:52.661 --> 37:54.883
Ruffians, it's been such a long time!

37:55.003 --> 37:56.765
Way too long!

37:57.465 --> 37:59.867
So we're gonna sing a bunch of songs.

37:59.907 --> 38:01.769
Some new ones, some favorites.

38:02.049 --> 38:05.532
But Rock n' Rawr Parties will generally be at the regular time.

38:05.552 --> 38:06.553
At the regular time.

38:06.573 --> 38:07.474
A bit different this week.

38:07.494 --> 38:12.818
Yeah, cause you can see on a Saturday, we're gonna be in Sydney for Slice!

38:12.878 --> 38:14.780
We're gonna be doing some...

38:15.020 --> 38:15.940
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

38:15.980 --> 38:19.041
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

38:35.848 --> 38:38.629
And let's BAU BAU all together!

38:39.149 --> 38:43.611
And then Sunday, we made a little mistake.

38:43.631 --> 38:44.231
We were like, oh!

38:44.571 --> 38:46.732
It's gonna be Minecraft!

38:46.752 --> 38:51.254
But then we remembered that we had a very very special thing planned.

38:51.394 --> 38:54.055
We're gonna be playing Party Animals!

38:54.075 --> 38:55.436
Advent vs Justin!

39:01.327 --> 39:05.689
So, Minecraft will have to look forward to when it comes up next.

39:06.830 --> 39:10.452
But, we're ready to be party animals and show justice, you know.

39:12.692 --> 39:13.212
Exactly.

39:13.272 --> 39:16.133
BAU BAU!

39:16.253 --> 39:18.895
And that's our schedule for next- this week!

39:19.295 --> 39:22.716
This week!

39:23.556 --> 39:25.297
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

39:25.357 --> 39:31.680
And for the Ruffians joining us to the archive today, here's your FUWAMOCO word for the comments!

39:32.852 --> 39:34.053
It's BAU BAU!

39:34.093 --> 39:35.034
We're back!

39:35.494 --> 39:39.857
BAU BAU!

39:39.997 --> 39:44.780
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

39:44.980 --> 39:46.721
I'm so happy, Ruffians!

39:46.761 --> 39:49.924
We missed you so much!

39:49.944 --> 39:51.284
We missed you a lot.

39:53.309 --> 40:00.419
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

40:01.060 --> 40:01.921
Night Owl!

40:02.321 --> 40:03.683
BAU BAU!

40:03.904 --> 40:04.545
That one!

40:05.005 --> 40:06.347
BAU BAU!

40:06.588 --> 40:07.208
Vulcan!

40:07.669 --> 40:08.290
BAU BAU!

40:08.850 --> 40:11.793
It's time for FUWAMOCO!

40:30.070 --> 40:30.870
Torch!

40:31.291 --> 40:32.732
BAU BAU!

40:32.752 --> 40:38.619
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

40:38.999 --> 40:41.782
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

40:41.802 --> 40:43.204
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

40:43.284 --> 40:44.045
BAU BAU!
