05:16.488 --> 05:18.490
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:19.511 --> 05:22.853
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:22.873 --> 05:26.716
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:26.837 --> 05:28.798
BAU BAU!

05:29.439 --> 05:31.821
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:32.381 --> 05:34.703
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:35.023 --> 05:37.626
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:37.706 --> 05:39.767
BAU BAU!

05:40.368 --> 05:44.291
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:44.411 --> 05:45.252
BAU BAU!

05:46.392 --> 05:51.755
Thank you, Ruffians, for being here today for our 110th episode!

05:51.995 --> 05:52.535
BAU BAU! 110!

05:52.595 --> 05:52.996
Yeah!

05:53.036 --> 05:55.137
We're back, Ruffians!

05:55.457 --> 05:55.997
Hooray!

05:56.137 --> 05:56.817
Yeah!

05:57.098 --> 05:57.338
BAU BAU!

06:06.822 --> 06:09.826
Wow, we're Ruffians here today!

06:10.146 --> 06:14.591
Joining us for the first time, let's explain what FUWAMOCO Morning is!

06:15.292 --> 06:23.581
Wow, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

06:23.601 --> 06:26.103
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:27.565 --> 06:33.190
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:33.330 --> 06:38.674
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:39.015 --> 06:42.658
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:43.198 --> 06:45.039
BAU BAU!

06:45.139 --> 06:46.160
You're on the right paw.

06:46.180 --> 06:46.800
Already?

06:47.000 --> 06:47.521
Already?

06:48.101 --> 06:49.722
Our job's done then, Moco-chan.

06:50.062 --> 06:51.323
Bye!

06:51.663 --> 06:52.804
Bye!

06:53.444 --> 06:56.546
This was FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:56.826 --> 06:57.946
We just started, Moco-chan.

06:57.966 --> 06:58.567
We can't end.

07:00.012 --> 07:08.419
It's been a little while since the last FUWAMOCO Morning because we went on a little bit of a trip.

07:08.859 --> 07:13.543
Our first trip had two FUWAMOCO Mornings this week.

07:20.388 --> 07:21.569
Yeah!

07:21.709 --> 07:23.429
But we missed you, Ruffians.

07:23.689 --> 07:31.072
Although we did talk on Wednesday, FUWAMOCO, so... But we'll get to that later.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.673
Yeah, let's see what today has for us.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.557
Ruffians.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.998
Your eyes are pretty sharp because...

07:47.897 --> 07:52.740
There was another Pero Sighting.

07:52.760 --> 07:52.820
Why?

07:53.941 --> 07:54.582
Why?

07:54.722 --> 07:57.724
Ruffians, you need to stop running into him, okay?

07:57.964 --> 08:01.046
I feel like there's just more and more Pero Sightings.

08:02.007 --> 08:03.588
There's enough for me to do, Moco-chan.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.949
There's something going on.

08:04.969 --> 08:07.831
I feel like I told you, Ruffians, stay away.

08:08.211 --> 08:09.392
Make sure you have pudding.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.994
But... Let's see this time.

08:14.635 --> 08:16.737
Where was he seen, huh, Ruffians?

08:17.168 --> 08:18.828
De-den!

08:19.589 --> 08:23.329
Oh, this is quite the different Pero Sighting.

08:23.349 --> 08:28.011
You tried to calm him down with some yarn, but he absorbed it.

08:28.031 --> 08:28.611
Huh?

08:28.951 --> 08:29.651
What the heck?

08:30.011 --> 08:30.611
Huh?

08:33.512 --> 08:34.512
I know you know.

08:34.532 --> 08:44.555
He kinda, maybe looks a little bit cute like this after maybe just a bit playing with the yarn, but he's not a cat, you know.

08:44.575 --> 08:46.055
Pero can't be this cute.

08:49.109 --> 08:51.514
No, no, I don't know.

08:51.914 --> 08:55.461
But you're in a good interest, Pero, you know.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.242
Pretty.

08:56.443 --> 08:57.926
Yeah, he is pretty.

08:58.988 --> 08:59.408
Pudding!

08:59.649 --> 09:00.009
Right!

09:00.049 --> 09:00.689
Yarn!

09:00.789 --> 09:01.370
Not yarn.

09:02.371 --> 09:16.041
But, you know, Ruffians keep on mentioning it to you, but maybe if instead you actually give him some pudding instead of yarn, he wouldn't be in this situation, huh?

09:16.522 --> 09:22.867
Yeah, but I mean he does look pretty happy having some good tunes to listen to from your headphones, huh?

09:23.047 --> 09:25.128
That's true, just your headphones are gone now.

09:25.148 --> 09:25.849
They're his.

09:27.841 --> 09:31.143
Well, I guess you can always get some cheaper ones, and... Yeah.

09:31.803 --> 09:35.725
He's just happy maybe being a little... He is now!

09:36.925 --> 09:38.846
He's listening to Lifetime Showtime!

09:39.387 --> 09:40.027
He better be.

09:40.047 --> 09:44.029
He's very cute.

09:44.149 --> 09:44.309
Yeah!

09:44.729 --> 09:45.810
Yeah, just this once.

09:46.662 --> 09:50.323
BAU BAU!

09:50.363 --> 09:51.063
Just this once.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.263
Just this once, okay?

09:52.703 --> 09:53.663
Early, got it?

09:53.763 --> 09:55.844
Early acts alone.

09:56.024 --> 09:59.104
Well, that's what we wanted to mention, Ruffians.

09:59.805 --> 10:04.626
Well, you know, we just got back from our trip together with Abyss!

10:05.106 --> 10:06.846
And, wait a minute!

10:07.146 --> 10:09.527
We're all ready to sing together!

10:09.547 --> 10:11.287
To sing for you, Ruffians!

10:11.767 --> 10:14.948
Because we had our first off-club karaoke stream!

10:14.988 --> 10:17.049
Right after, you know!

10:17.069 --> 10:19.650
And we sang a bunch of songs earlier!

10:19.910 --> 10:22.630
You know, a lot of anime, game, vocaloid songs.

10:22.650 --> 10:24.191
Yeah, vocaloid too!

10:24.351 --> 10:28.472
In case you missed it, it's archived on our channel here, so please check it out, okay?

10:28.532 --> 10:29.593
Yeah!

10:29.793 --> 10:34.874
We really wanted to make sure you know that we could save the memories for now, you know?

10:34.894 --> 10:35.094
Yeah.

10:35.315 --> 10:37.415
We could watch it over and over again.

10:37.435 --> 10:38.456
Then we'd go anywhere.

10:38.476 --> 10:38.656
Yeah.

10:40.517 --> 10:42.398
But it was really, really scary.

10:42.598 --> 10:45.681
And we had such a blast all together with everyone.

10:45.701 --> 10:48.863
It was a good one, you liked it?

10:50.204 --> 10:50.845
Yeah.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.367
Ah, you watched it!

10:53.467 --> 10:55.188
BAU BAU!

10:55.568 --> 10:58.150
There's too many songs we wanted to sing.

10:58.250 --> 10:58.390
Right!

10:58.430 --> 11:03.434
You know, Advent was like, oh, let's sing this one, and let's sing this one, and let's sing this one, and this one too.

11:03.474 --> 11:06.397
If we're gonna sing this song, we have to choose from these other three.

11:08.793 --> 11:14.238
Yeah, we actually chose way too many songs, but... Now I'm thinking we didn't sing enough.

11:14.719 --> 11:17.401
So... It's an important chance together.

11:17.421 --> 11:21.385
It was really important to us, so... That's why we wanted to organize it.

11:21.445 --> 11:22.466
Right, yeah.

11:22.566 --> 11:25.249
And it was our dream for a long time, too.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.850
Was it on our goals list?

11:27.891 --> 11:28.472
Probably.

11:28.861 --> 11:29.181
Sirens!

11:52.491 --> 11:55.293
First Rebellion, now Sirens.

11:55.994 --> 11:58.275
What did you think, Ruffians?

11:58.295 --> 12:01.698
Gonna hear maybe a little bit, you know what the tease is.

12:01.718 --> 12:02.519
Do you feel teased?

12:11.920 --> 12:12.700
Just like that.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.943
That's how it goes.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.043
It sounds goofy!

12:17.243 --> 12:19.945
I thought you said goofy!

12:19.985 --> 12:20.986
Not goofy!

12:21.466 --> 12:21.606
No!

12:21.686 --> 12:23.087
The opposite of that.

12:23.447 --> 12:23.807
Yeah.

12:24.188 --> 12:25.548
It's really, really cool.

12:25.789 --> 12:26.729
More super fancy.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.791
It's exactly what's in the trailer!

12:28.811 --> 12:36.035
It's not a goof- Although there is one part that's kind of goofy.

12:36.095 --> 12:37.256
Right, Moco-chan?

12:37.276 --> 12:37.436
What?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.017
There's one part that's kind of goofy.

12:39.742 --> 12:45.132
I don't think the Ruffians will be able to hear it though until you maybe listen to it 20-50 times over.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.826
Right?

12:49.086 --> 12:51.348
You gotta listen with your ears, okay?

12:51.688 --> 12:59.196
But it's really fancy, not so goofy, so we hope that you'll look forward to it.

12:59.296 --> 13:09.065
It'll be releasing very soon, so please join us during our first anniversary of collab with all of us on Sunday on the 28th.

13:10.366 --> 13:14.671
at 8pm PT, not 6pm PT.

13:15.372 --> 13:24.923
Oh, and for FUWAMO fans out there, maybe you haven't seen the teaser yet, or maybe you want to see it again, you can find it on Twitter on the hololive English Twitter account.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.265
FUWAMOCO, we were tweeted too.

13:27.305 --> 13:31.448
We're also on the hololive English YouTube channel as well.

13:31.808 --> 13:40.154
And you know, as for the upcoming Advent with anniversary collab, the off collab, you know, there's been a bit of a change of plan there.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.615
So yeah, it's two hours later than expected.

13:43.616 --> 13:49.520
We hope that you'll be able to stay up just a bit later than usual on a Sunday night for it.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.422
I know it's rough.

13:51.962 --> 14:03.470
It's rough, but... Yeah, I think there's some exciting things planned, and maybe downslides, things will change, and... Thank you for understanding, Ruffians!

14:03.490 --> 14:04.251
I know it's rough.

14:04.371 --> 14:10.155
Yeah, you know, especially for Ruffians further on to the other side, you know?

14:12.448 --> 14:13.929
Thank you!

14:13.989 --> 14:18.112
It'll be a really really special first anniversary for sure!

14:20.513 --> 14:21.994
BAU BAU!

14:22.034 --> 14:28.538
You know, not just a first anniversary together with Advent, but the Ruffians being together!

14:28.778 --> 14:30.959
That kind of celebration comes a little bit later.

14:32.525 --> 14:33.885
BAU BAU!

14:53.912 --> 14:58.193
At this event, everyone builds their own homemade figures for all its kits!

14:58.674 --> 15:01.274
And you know, they display them and sell them too!

15:01.374 --> 15:01.674
Yeah!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.515
It's a super creative event!

15:03.895 --> 15:08.937
And we always love seeing what kind of special figures everyone is making!

15:09.357 --> 15:12.658
You know, usually the kits are only made in very small amounts.

15:12.998 --> 15:13.638
Lots and lots.

15:13.898 --> 15:14.538
Yeah, yeah.

15:14.598 --> 15:16.119
And you have to put them together and pou-

15:16.399 --> 15:16.679
Paint.

15:16.880 --> 15:17.821
Pound, pound, pound.

15:18.021 --> 15:19.522
Paint them yourself!

15:19.642 --> 15:21.705
Pound, pound, pound.

15:22.225 --> 15:22.846
Pound, pound.

15:23.066 --> 15:25.709
Maybe there's some pound, pound, poundinging the pieces together.

15:25.789 --> 15:26.610
If they don't fit.

15:27.991 --> 15:30.213
When it comes to the airbrushing, right.

15:30.373 --> 15:31.995
But it's so amazing!

15:32.055 --> 15:34.398
We love one thing so much.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.139
There's always so much to look at!

15:36.280 --> 15:36.660
Right!

15:38.746 --> 15:39.667
Ruffians!

15:40.347 --> 15:49.435
This year, this Rufffest, there's going to be a very special FUWAMOCO figure that's on display!

15:49.615 --> 15:50.996
Look!

15:51.336 --> 15:52.978
Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

15:52.998 --> 15:55.860
Yeah, it's a family figure!

15:56.280 --> 15:59.042
Thank you so much, FIGZOO!

15:59.082 --> 16:07.389
Now FIGZOO will be displaying the completely painted and assembled kit that they made from the ground up of us and Perroccino.

16:07.449 --> 16:08.270
She's a mom, though.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.090
Yeah.

16:09.190 --> 16:09.731
Right?

16:09.831 --> 16:12.012
It's amazing, right?

16:12.532 --> 16:14.893
It's amazing, right?

16:15.033 --> 16:17.174
Kawaii!

16:17.234 --> 16:18.955
Yeah, kawaii!

16:18.995 --> 16:21.676
You know, all the... This is just made of love.

16:21.756 --> 16:23.537
It's completely made of love.

16:23.597 --> 16:24.917
Completely from love.

16:25.058 --> 16:25.778
And some passion.

16:25.918 --> 16:29.880
Yeah, and heartbreak, and sweat, and definitely some tears too, you know?

16:30.180 --> 16:31.701
It's so beautiful!

16:32.361 --> 16:33.842
I love it, I love it.

16:34.402 --> 16:36.663
Can we look at it closer, Moco-chan?

16:43.901 --> 16:45.362
Look!

16:45.722 --> 16:46.662
So cute!

16:46.682 --> 16:47.682
Amazing!

16:47.722 --> 16:48.142
Right?

16:48.502 --> 16:53.403
I love my poses too, it's very FUWAMOCO-chan!

16:54.344 --> 16:56.184
The base, it's a bit nasty.

16:56.244 --> 16:58.385
It's kind of like a plate too, right?

16:58.425 --> 17:00.725
A plate with a petal there looking at you.

17:00.965 --> 17:01.385
Hi, girl.

17:01.425 --> 17:01.705
What?

17:01.725 --> 17:02.806
A petal.

17:02.906 --> 17:08.227
And you have nice shoes and a paw print!

17:10.185 --> 17:12.107
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:12.147 --> 17:13.288
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:13.368 --> 17:14.709
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.171
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.569
Let's take a look again.

18:02.698 --> 18:04.061
Just like that!

18:04.262 --> 18:06.888
You see, we're on the pon-de-rings.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.151
Moco-chan's tummy is kinda... Wow.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.292
What about my tummy?

18:14.932 --> 18:15.812
I don't know.

18:15.832 --> 18:17.672
You know you're not supposed to touch.

18:18.072 --> 18:18.833
No touching.

18:18.893 --> 18:19.993
No touching the figures.

18:20.073 --> 18:21.633
Moco-chan's tummy might be different.

18:22.153 --> 18:22.693
Yeah.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.514
So... Sexy Pero!

18:25.974 --> 18:27.454
Pero sexy!

18:27.554 --> 18:28.634
He's just sitting there.

18:28.674 --> 18:29.515
He's not doing anything.

18:29.535 --> 18:30.735
He's not doing anything.

18:30.795 --> 18:33.515
He's just like... Right.

18:33.795 --> 18:34.715
Pero ero.

18:35.496 --> 18:35.896
What?

18:36.676 --> 18:37.016
What?

18:37.962 --> 18:50.090
Ruffians, there's probably many of you who'd like to get their paws on this kit and assemble it right!

19:01.117 --> 19:01.838
Yeah, cheeky.

19:01.858 --> 19:08.386
So, I think that, you know, there's probably even more Ruffians who would love to have it as a pre-painted scale figure.

19:08.406 --> 19:11.470
I don't know, but there's something special about garai-shiki, too.

19:11.790 --> 19:14.814
They both have their own... their own... miryoku.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.417
Their own... attractive points.

19:17.438 --> 19:18.999
Attractive points to them!

19:20.581 --> 19:27.629
FUWAMOCO, of course we'd absolutely love to have something like this beautiful and cute in our collection!

19:27.909 --> 19:30.231
Yeah, I don't think we can stop staring, huh?

19:30.311 --> 19:30.532
No.

19:30.852 --> 19:35.377
Thank you so much for making us into a figure!

19:35.417 --> 19:36.858
Thank you!

19:36.918 --> 19:39.160
BAU BAU!

19:40.230 --> 19:43.091
Alright, the shipping, yeah!

19:43.731 --> 19:46.332
You know, once it's assembled, it's kind of assembled.

19:46.813 --> 19:48.173
But you gotta be careful.

19:48.373 --> 19:49.754
It's more dangerous.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.915
Very delicate, you know.

19:51.975 --> 19:53.335
Very, very delicate.

19:54.075 --> 19:54.976
Gotta be careful.

19:55.256 --> 19:55.876
BAU BAU!

19:55.916 --> 19:59.137
Let's look at photos!

19:59.257 --> 20:02.919
I hope I can see lots and lots of photos from all different angles!

20:02.979 --> 20:04.339
Yeah, any photo of me!

20:04.720 --> 20:06.460
Please take photos, okay?

20:07.281 --> 20:08.201
No low angles.

20:09.411 --> 20:11.473
I miss you deshita.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.376
BAU BAU!

20:15.738 --> 20:21.604
Like we kind of mentioned, we're back from our first trip since we debuted.

20:21.624 --> 20:24.066
Our little vacation.

20:24.087 --> 20:25.428
Little vacation, right?

20:26.649 --> 20:33.354
We had a Twitter space instead of FUWAMOCO Morning Wednesday, but I don't know if Ruffians were able to listen in.

20:33.414 --> 20:37.037
I know it's a bit tricky because it's not YouTube, it's Twitter.

20:37.057 --> 20:39.719
Yeah, and Twitter's a little bit funny sometimes.

20:39.779 --> 20:44.483
Yeah, but we were chatting together with Biboo and Nerissa!

20:44.823 --> 20:49.127
And while Shiori was really angry, my kawaii senpai too!

20:49.147 --> 20:49.887
She was out.

20:49.927 --> 20:50.948
Yeah, she was really out.

20:51.928 --> 20:54.230
We're all in a ryokan that we're staying in.

20:54.470 --> 20:58.192
A ryokan is kind of like a Japanese inn.

20:58.212 --> 21:02.234
But a lot of times, they have an onsen.

21:02.254 --> 21:04.575
It's a really big one.

21:04.595 --> 21:04.795
Yeah.

21:04.895 --> 21:08.497
It's an onsen with a big, you know, natural spring bath.

21:09.217 --> 21:13.880
It was so much fun!

21:13.900 --> 21:18.282
We're just really happy that we could spend some down time together with all of them.

21:19.258 --> 21:19.558
Yeah.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.800
You know, we still all had homework to do.

21:21.820 --> 21:22.360
Yeah.

21:22.841 --> 21:24.742
So we're like, I just woke up.

21:24.782 --> 21:27.184
I'm like, I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm like, you know.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.464
No, so what about this, huh?

21:28.745 --> 21:29.225
Yeah.

21:29.285 --> 21:32.867
But we went on lots of adventures and went into lots of baths.

21:32.907 --> 21:33.648
Yes!

21:33.668 --> 21:37.390
And Ruffians may be not too familiar with onsen.

21:38.011 --> 21:44.015
But, you know, it's a natural spring bath and you can't bring anything in- You can't wear anything in there.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.757
In anime, sometimes I wear a towel.

21:48.338 --> 21:48.478
No.

21:49.932 --> 21:53.294
The towel you can kind of bring with you, but you can't put it in the water.

21:53.314 --> 21:56.676
No bathing suits either!

21:56.756 --> 21:59.798
So first, we went in a tiny bath.

22:01.419 --> 22:04.741
Altogether, it was probably sized for three to four people.

22:04.761 --> 22:06.582
I think it was for four people.

22:06.602 --> 22:10.905
There was other things around that kind of made it seem like it was for four people.

22:10.985 --> 22:11.945
True.

22:12.245 --> 22:12.606
Yeah.

22:13.586 --> 22:14.807
It was a bit tiny.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.309
But it was good!

22:17.349 --> 22:17.849
Nice!

22:17.969 --> 22:18.390
Yeah!

22:18.430 --> 22:21.652
And I poured cold water on Biboo unexpectedly!

22:21.792 --> 22:23.974
And then I drank a little cold water.

22:23.994 --> 22:28.717
Advent soup.

22:29.518 --> 22:30.879
No, the water is clean.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.421
Yeah.

22:34.762 --> 22:39.085
You didn't drink the water that you poured on Biboo.

22:40.474 --> 22:44.216
I poured the water and then the remaining water, I drank it.

22:45.217 --> 22:46.498
I didn't pour all my water.

22:47.158 --> 23:00.306
You know there's a bunch of different ones and you know there's an outdoor one so you can feel the, what would normally be cold air.

23:00.566 --> 23:02.967
But there is a bit of a happening.

23:03.728 --> 23:08.298
Yeah, you know, the outside sometimes there's bugs.

23:09.579 --> 23:19.021
And... I was on one side of the bath, and Nerissa and Calli-senpai were talking on the other side of the bath.

23:19.581 --> 23:24.182
And I saw there was this big flying ant on Nerissa, on her arm.

23:24.282 --> 23:28.983
So I was like, okay, I'm not gonna say anything, I'm just gonna walk over to her and hit it off with her.

23:30.524 --> 23:34.865
And maybe I got a little bit too excited, and I kind of really slapped her.

23:37.264 --> 23:41.005
That was the most impressive slapstick.

23:41.385 --> 23:45.066
What did you do that for?

23:45.146 --> 23:50.428
I thought I just snapped or something, right?

23:50.448 --> 23:54.449
I probably thought you were just walking over and be like, hi!

23:54.529 --> 23:54.889
Right!

23:55.029 --> 23:58.250
I'm gonna sit over here and you just know I'm gonna smack you!

23:58.970 --> 23:59.950
Right?

24:00.050 --> 24:02.431
I don't know where the bug went, but it disappeared.

24:02.752 --> 24:04.312
No problems after that.

24:04.432 --> 24:06.253
Yeah.

24:06.393 --> 24:07.573
Bueno, eso.

24:09.274 --> 24:10.575
It's okay.

24:10.635 --> 24:12.095
It's either the bug or it's Fuwawa.

24:12.115 --> 24:13.656
She kissed it better, it's okay.

24:13.896 --> 24:15.657
But speaking of kisses... Yeah.

24:24.865 --> 24:26.485
You know, we had lots of food.

24:26.505 --> 24:26.585
Yeah.

24:26.646 --> 24:28.646
Yeah, shabu shabu.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.967
We had just a few snacks.

24:32.507 --> 24:33.567
You know, some sweets.

24:34.208 --> 24:34.548
Yeah.

24:35.848 --> 24:37.008
What are you doing?

24:37.389 --> 24:40.309
I think both Biboo and us, we had a lot of sweets.

24:40.709 --> 24:41.990
Maybe got a bit...

24:44.565 --> 24:46.407
Yeah, yeah.

24:46.427 --> 24:51.391
I saw my Biboo just going around giving everybody kisses.

24:51.611 --> 24:53.213
But then she forgot you.

24:53.513 --> 24:54.714
She forgot me!

24:55.335 --> 24:56.816
I was all ready too.

24:56.836 --> 25:03.101
It was cute to see her go around the table and be like... I'm ready!

25:09.506 --> 25:11.747
She looked like a little penguin.

25:12.247 --> 25:13.208
Right!

25:13.248 --> 25:19.471
Going up and giving grandma's kisses kind of feel.

25:19.571 --> 25:19.871
Right!

25:20.791 --> 25:21.411
Yeah.

25:21.752 --> 25:25.974
You know, we got to cuddle on the futon together.

25:26.054 --> 25:27.054
Cuddle puddle!

25:27.134 --> 25:27.634
Yeah.

25:27.914 --> 25:30.075
We're looking all at Twitter together.

25:30.616 --> 25:31.196
Yeah!

25:31.676 --> 25:33.357
I walked over and I just see them all.

25:34.424 --> 25:35.004
Twittle.

25:35.064 --> 25:35.505
Twittle.

25:49.223 --> 25:49.723
Konbini.

25:50.123 --> 25:52.165
They had a seating area, so you know.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.865
We just sort of hung out.

25:54.206 --> 25:54.906
Yeah.

25:55.286 --> 25:55.946
Had snacks.

25:56.287 --> 25:56.887
Yeah!

25:56.907 --> 25:58.208
At the konbini.

25:58.488 --> 25:58.928
Yeah.

25:58.948 --> 26:02.870
We're like, wow, this is really relaxing.

26:02.950 --> 26:03.690
Yeah!

26:03.771 --> 26:05.732
It was a nice, quiet konbini.

26:05.752 --> 26:06.172
Yeah.

26:06.772 --> 26:09.914
Just chilling out at the konbini.

26:09.974 --> 26:11.134
That was an adventure.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.015
A cat book.

26:12.415 --> 26:12.615
Yeah!

26:12.635 --> 26:13.996
Look at the cat book.

26:14.296 --> 26:16.437
We're like, this is my favorite cat!

26:18.338 --> 26:18.598
Yeah.

26:19.319 --> 26:20.779
Those kind of things.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.200
Yeah.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.201
Nobody strange is a crowbar.

26:24.802 --> 26:25.002
No.

26:25.442 --> 26:26.643
We're the strange people.

26:26.763 --> 26:27.203
Yeah.

26:27.743 --> 26:31.666
And it was interesting too because we went to the onsen!

26:31.686 --> 26:32.206
Yeah!

26:32.266 --> 26:39.290
It was one time, you know, we had a bunch of homework that we had to do and we couldn't go together with them all into another one of the onsen.

26:39.310 --> 26:42.992
So we heard later that there was a cold bath!

26:43.012 --> 26:43.393
A cold bath!

26:43.413 --> 26:43.853
And we were like...

26:44.553 --> 26:46.454
And it was really tiny.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.114
A tiny cold bath.

26:48.394 --> 26:55.776
Yeah, so all four of them all kind of jumped into it and went like thigh to thigh.

26:55.877 --> 26:58.177
Cold bath, right?

26:58.297 --> 26:58.757
Yeah.

26:59.398 --> 27:03.759
And there was some grandmas that walked by and they were like, huh?

27:05.960 --> 27:06.200
No.

27:07.100 --> 27:07.520
I know.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.141
And then when we went down next morning to take the bath.

27:11.501 --> 27:12.061
Yeah.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.622
They're like, there's the cold bath.

27:15.065 --> 27:21.530
And then we looked at the sign together with Calli-senpai and Nerissa and we're like, uh, this isn't a bath!

27:22.090 --> 27:27.815
This is just a little pool that you can take cold water in to splash yourself after the song.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.477
Yeah, it says, please use the little, the ladle.

27:32.178 --> 27:33.739
It didn't say don't come in here.

27:36.221 --> 27:36.701
Yeah.

27:37.462 --> 27:39.864
Definitely wasn't a bathroom.

27:39.964 --> 27:42.366
No, it definitely wasn't a bath!

27:45.093 --> 27:45.453
Yeah!

27:46.694 --> 27:48.176
Lasting Impression, right?

27:48.196 --> 27:49.076
Yeah.

27:49.617 --> 27:50.157
Yeah.

27:50.417 --> 27:51.498
We went in the sauna.

27:51.779 --> 27:52.279
Yeah!

27:52.359 --> 27:54.040
Nerissa and Calli-senpai!

27:54.101 --> 27:55.201
I did not go in the sauna.

27:55.261 --> 27:56.723
It's too hot!

27:57.023 --> 27:57.163
No!

27:57.203 --> 27:57.523
Yeah.

27:57.824 --> 28:01.547
Nerissa was like... She was only in there for a couple seconds.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.969
And then Calli-senpai and I were in there.

28:03.989 --> 28:06.050
We were talking about anime.

28:06.070 --> 28:08.993
I beat Calli-senpai.

28:09.013 --> 28:10.094
I stayed in there longer.

28:10.394 --> 28:10.995
Yeah!

28:11.115 --> 28:11.895
I didn't give in.

28:11.975 --> 28:12.516
Yeah!

28:14.014 --> 28:16.735
It was very hot though, it's hard to breathe.

28:16.795 --> 28:17.435
It's too hot.

28:17.535 --> 28:19.835
It was really fun!

28:22.076 --> 28:26.597
I really hope that, you know, we can go back together with everyone soon.

28:26.857 --> 28:29.777
I liked our adventure at the conbini.

28:29.857 --> 28:34.118
It was really fun!

28:34.198 --> 28:36.699
But now we're back, Ruffians!

28:36.839 --> 28:40.279
Our adventure to have even more fun together!

28:40.779 --> 28:42.460
The sonnet isn't a competition!

28:43.600 --> 28:44.581
No, it's a competition.

28:45.943 --> 28:49.987
Yeah.

28:50.227 --> 28:50.948
BAU BAU!

28:50.968 --> 28:52.829
We wanted a vlog.

28:53.350 --> 28:54.871
A vlog!

28:54.891 --> 28:56.113
See, we wanted to do that.

28:56.133 --> 28:58.275
We wanted to do stuff like that.

28:58.335 --> 28:58.795
Yeah.

28:59.376 --> 29:05.802
But we want to- This time it seems like it was kind of a little bit difficult.

29:05.862 --> 29:06.263
Yeah.

29:07.055 --> 29:09.657
That would've been nice though.

29:09.697 --> 29:10.658
Maybe next time!

29:10.718 --> 29:12.179
We'll have to see.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.042
BAU BAU!

29:15.082 --> 29:16.023
Two spaces apart.

29:16.763 --> 29:17.964
Maybe different parts of it.

29:19.486 --> 29:19.786
Yeah.

29:20.579 --> 29:21.540
BAU BAU!

29:21.640 --> 29:22.460
BAU BAU!

29:22.861 --> 29:24.502
That'll be fun though, you know?

29:24.522 --> 29:27.263
You can see what breakfast is like with Nerissa.

29:27.383 --> 29:28.944
It's always very interesting.

29:29.325 --> 29:29.465
Yeah!

29:29.885 --> 29:30.365
Yeah.

29:30.566 --> 29:30.906
It's fun.

29:30.966 --> 29:31.886
We all share food.

29:32.227 --> 29:36.529
Yeah, Biboo eating tamago kake gohan for the first time.

29:36.549 --> 29:36.990
Yeah!

29:37.050 --> 29:39.211
Karin-senpai teaching her how to do it.

29:39.391 --> 29:40.011
Yeah!

29:40.031 --> 29:44.174
You know tamago kake gohan is where you put a raw egg on the rice and you eat it.

29:44.214 --> 29:44.494
Yeah.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.665
Biboo liked it too.

29:48.685 --> 29:51.406
I wanted to try the Calli-senpai method, but I was full.

29:51.426 --> 29:53.506
Morning for you too.

29:54.706 --> 29:56.287
BAU BAU!

29:56.447 --> 29:58.468
Why is everyone so funny?

29:58.888 --> 30:02.509
But, let's see who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan.

30:02.529 --> 30:07.770
Alright, Doggie of the Day is... It's Charlie!

30:08.090 --> 30:08.670
Charlie!

30:08.771 --> 30:10.171
BAU BAU!

30:10.211 --> 30:12.071
Look how goofy she looks!

30:12.392 --> 30:12.692
Right!

30:12.712 --> 30:13.492
Alright, I'll sort of...

30:14.983 --> 30:18.624
Is she up there with the blanket?

30:18.684 --> 30:21.665
Yeah, so many blankets there with her.

30:21.685 --> 30:23.666
She looks very well-loved.

30:23.706 --> 30:25.366
She's like, oh, what are you doing?

30:25.666 --> 30:27.247
Taking a photo of me?

30:27.707 --> 30:27.967
Really?

30:28.087 --> 30:30.388
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

30:30.428 --> 30:31.148
Right?

30:31.608 --> 30:33.809
So cute!

30:33.869 --> 30:34.289
Right?

30:34.389 --> 30:35.209
Ball of love.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.750
But those ears are very beautiful, right?

30:38.811 --> 30:40.091
Kind of makes you want to touch them.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.640
As long as they're not my ears.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.961
I like your eyebrows.

30:44.521 --> 30:46.242
Oh, the eyebrows!

30:46.282 --> 30:47.623
Wanna touch those too, right?

30:48.584 --> 30:52.447
Moco-chan, how does Charlie BAU BAU?

30:59.583 --> 31:03.168
Are you sure that's not Bousouzoku?

31:03.548 --> 31:03.829
No.

31:05.290 --> 31:05.591
No.

31:05.611 --> 31:10.597
It sounds like a motorbike.

31:10.737 --> 31:12.319
It's not a motorcar.

31:12.739 --> 31:13.700
Not Mococar.

31:13.981 --> 31:14.141
No.

31:16.283 --> 31:16.743
It's Charlie!

31:16.844 --> 31:18.945
It's Charlie!

31:19.485 --> 31:21.486
BAU BAU!

31:21.706 --> 31:24.988
I think we can all see that Charlie is very content.

31:25.508 --> 31:25.989
You know?

31:26.029 --> 31:28.370
She's so sweet.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.511
She gets to go out and walks all the time.

31:30.591 --> 31:32.412
It's a Ruffian too!

31:32.432 --> 31:35.434
How nice, FUWAMOCO-chan.

31:35.454 --> 31:35.834
Yeah.

31:36.174 --> 31:38.096
You know that probably gives lots of hugs.

31:38.336 --> 31:39.817
Yeah, lots of hugs.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.297
Maybe, maybe some treats.

31:42.138 --> 31:42.998
I don't know.

31:43.479 --> 31:45.600
Yeah, I don't think it gets much better.

31:46.257 --> 31:53.703
But, you know, maybe if she got some extra tweets, extra headbutts... I mean, we could get those instead.

31:53.963 --> 31:55.384
BAU BAU!

31:55.464 --> 31:57.546
BAU BAU!

31:58.747 --> 32:00.228
Charmy's so cute.

32:00.308 --> 32:00.908
Good life.

32:00.948 --> 32:02.009
BAU BAU!

32:02.089 --> 32:04.010
BAU BAU!

32:04.891 --> 32:09.955
And next for our Today I Went On A Walk, we have... De-den!

32:11.276 --> 32:12.737
Sukira!

32:12.977 --> 32:14.999
Is this a walk?

32:16.393 --> 32:19.174
You know, if you see the cicadas on your rock, right?

32:19.894 --> 32:22.555
Yeah, but wow, that's a lot of legs.

32:23.355 --> 32:26.996
It looks like a very fresh and tender cicada though, huh?

32:27.716 --> 32:28.076
Yeah.

32:28.856 --> 32:29.156
Yeah.

32:29.236 --> 32:29.517
What?!

32:29.657 --> 32:30.657
It's a cicada!

32:30.997 --> 32:32.897
You get to see them, but not us!

32:32.937 --> 32:34.558
We've been searching everywhere, right?

32:34.578 --> 32:35.838
I know, it's shedding!

32:35.858 --> 32:42.100
You know, we thought maybe we could find them near the onsen, but... We've looked in the trees.

32:43.990 --> 32:44.510
I don't know.

32:44.570 --> 32:48.852
I feel like, you know, this one's so fresh, it would blend in well to the glass.

32:48.932 --> 32:49.453
Right!

32:49.673 --> 32:54.355
But I guess, you know, it's going to harden up and then become brown like the tree bark, too.

32:54.395 --> 32:56.336
And then it'll be hard to find again, huh?

32:56.416 --> 32:57.076
Right!

32:57.656 --> 32:59.157
No, don't hurt it!

32:59.217 --> 33:00.198
Give it to us!

33:00.598 --> 33:02.299
Yeah, you know.

33:02.639 --> 33:04.500
Then somebody can enjoy it, right?

33:06.561 --> 33:06.881
Yeah.

33:07.081 --> 33:07.421
Enjoy.

33:08.261 --> 33:10.564
BAU BAU!

33:11.065 --> 33:13.909
That was a nice discovery, huh?

33:14.350 --> 33:14.951
Right!

33:15.071 --> 33:15.391
Nice.

33:15.671 --> 33:17.354
I kinda wanna pet a Enola.

33:17.714 --> 33:19.176
I wanna see Enola!

33:19.296 --> 33:19.897
BAU BAU!

33:20.017 --> 33:24.484
And for our Question of the Day we have...

33:24.904 --> 33:26.525
De-den!

33:27.046 --> 33:30.068
In the early days, you wanted to bring Pero back.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.731
You even went to the BAU Games to find him.

33:33.371 --> 33:37.474
But with every episode, your relationship with him seems to get worse.

33:37.955 --> 33:40.537
What happened between you and him?

33:40.617 --> 33:44.220
It's been a hundred plus episodes, and he still isn't back.

33:44.780 --> 33:45.701
Do you still want him?

33:45.721 --> 33:48.063
Are you sure about that, Pero?

33:48.503 --> 33:50.665
He's been around, you know, right?

33:51.246 --> 33:51.546
It is.

33:52.189 --> 33:54.552
But he's not nasty.

34:10.589 --> 34:11.429
Maybe.

34:12.129 --> 34:13.170
Maybe.

34:13.810 --> 34:23.173
Sometimes it's important to look past all the nasty things he says to us and how mean he is to all the Ruffians too.

34:23.573 --> 34:25.353
Is that okay, Ruffians?

34:26.594 --> 34:27.874
You know, you smile.

34:27.934 --> 34:29.415
It's not a danger at all.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.175
It's okay.

34:30.555 --> 34:32.216
He's not our mentor.

34:32.296 --> 34:33.136
He's our pet.

34:33.376 --> 34:34.016
Our pet.

34:34.296 --> 34:35.917
Don't listen to what he says.

34:35.957 --> 34:38.217
Listen to what we say, Ruffians.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.118
Yeah, okay.

34:41.332 --> 34:42.553
It's time to put him down.

34:42.573 --> 34:42.653
Wait!

34:42.853 --> 34:44.214
That's a bit far.

34:45.796 --> 34:47.677
He lived a very long time, okay?

34:47.697 --> 34:48.959
I don't think that's possible.

34:49.779 --> 34:51.521
I don't know, I wasn't considering that.

34:51.601 --> 34:53.442
He's Uncle Pero, that's too much!

34:53.603 --> 34:54.864
Okay, that's going too far.

34:54.904 --> 34:55.744
That's gross.

34:56.985 --> 34:59.247
That's gross, Ruffians.

34:59.948 --> 35:01.309
I don't know.

35:02.870 --> 35:04.332
He's the best, we love him!

35:06.000 --> 35:14.349
Well, if that's the case then... Maybe... If that's the case then... Maybe it would be a bit... For fear... If that's the case then... Oh?

35:15.010 --> 35:15.090
Oh?

35:41.463 --> 35:43.744
BAU BAU!

35:43.764 --> 35:48.104
Moco-chan!

35:49.145 --> 35:50.505
What's the problem?

35:50.765 --> 35:52.725
What do you mean what's the problem?

35:52.765 --> 35:57.646
It's because Pero, the Ruffians seem to really like Pero.

35:58.746 --> 36:01.307
Even though Pero's so nasty to them.

36:01.387 --> 36:03.867
Pero wanna protect your smile.

36:03.887 --> 36:03.927
No.

36:10.049 --> 36:10.669
That's true.

36:11.750 --> 36:12.671
That's true.

36:14.031 --> 36:14.752
He does!

36:15.492 --> 36:18.514
I don't think he does have rage in his mouth, okay?

36:18.534 --> 36:21.015
Yeah, he... Pero's just nasty.

36:21.396 --> 36:22.676
He wants your pudding.

36:22.837 --> 36:24.498
That's it, Ruffians.

36:25.598 --> 36:27.319
He's not here to protect anything.

36:27.559 --> 36:28.400
He's here to take.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.082
And you know... Any cute girls too.

36:32.162 --> 36:37.245
There wouldn't be any of that here, right?

36:44.213 --> 36:45.974
Yeah, Pero's nasty.

36:47.014 --> 36:51.356
He's nasty and we're gonna continue treating him as he deserves.

36:52.216 --> 36:52.597
Maybe?

36:53.117 --> 36:54.317
Not so fluffy and fuzzy?

36:54.337 --> 36:57.279
Yeah.

36:57.799 --> 37:01.861
Pero can go out to ch- Wait!

37:02.081 --> 37:06.583
Moco-chan, let's be fluffy and fuzzy to Pero and then you know we can get him to help us.

37:08.183 --> 37:09.444
Vaginitis, you know.

37:10.504 --> 37:11.825
Kinda getting in our way, right?

37:16.410 --> 37:17.231
Maybe that's okay.

37:17.291 --> 37:17.571
Yeah.

37:18.292 --> 37:19.133
Good idea.

37:19.473 --> 37:20.114
Good idea.

37:21.035 --> 37:22.136
BAU BAU!

37:22.937 --> 37:23.718
BAU BAU!

37:23.778 --> 37:27.202
Yeah, you know, justice is gonna get in our way, you know?

37:27.222 --> 37:29.104
We're having so much fun here!

37:29.124 --> 37:30.886
Free from the cells!

37:31.166 --> 37:31.487
Bye.

37:36.156 --> 37:36.716
BAU BAU!

37:36.736 --> 37:46.422
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning together with us here!

37:46.982 --> 37:49.743
We're always waiting for your submissions!

37:50.043 --> 37:52.225
You know your doggy have a day of walks!

37:53.085 --> 37:53.905
Going on walks.

37:53.945 --> 37:56.566
Thank you, Ruffians, for always sending us your walks.

37:56.606 --> 37:58.646
We love seeing where you go.

37:59.206 --> 38:00.106
Questions!

38:00.146 --> 38:02.487
You know, there's so many things going on.

38:02.527 --> 38:03.287
Cool things.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.347
Please let us know if you have any questions for us.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.108
And use the hashtag!

38:08.548 --> 38:09.368
Hashtag!

38:09.808 --> 38:11.968
FWMCMORNING!

38:12.149 --> 38:16.869
We're also looking for scoops that you can submit to us with the hashtag FWMCScoop.

38:16.929 --> 38:20.250
And if you see anything interesting going on in hololive English,

38:20.410 --> 38:21.532
BAU BAU!

38:21.672 --> 38:28.701
And we have another stream coming up very soon!

38:28.741 --> 38:29.542
We have... De-den?

38:37.041 --> 38:39.163
De-den!

38:40.856 --> 38:44.122
It's been a little while since we spelt.

38:54.244 --> 38:54.444
Right?

38:54.865 --> 38:55.565
What do you mean?

38:55.985 --> 39:02.050
You know, we kinda take some shortcuts, you know, instead of going F-U-W-A-M-O-C-O, just F-W-M-C-Y.

39:02.070 --> 39:02.610
M-O-C-O-C-O!

39:02.630 --> 39:04.872
That's true, maybe Moco-chan's good at spelling.

39:14.980 --> 39:15.801
Yeah, I can do it.

39:16.421 --> 39:24.327
We'll see how it goes, Ruffians, but we're gonna make sure that we get lots of rest so that we can spell the best possible, right?

39:24.988 --> 39:25.388
Let's hope.

39:26.529 --> 39:28.330
B-E-S-T, best.

39:28.831 --> 39:29.071
Yeah.

39:30.232 --> 39:32.013
BAU BAU!

39:32.653 --> 39:37.717
Oh, I'm ready for another trick question if they're like, how do you spell same?

39:37.737 --> 39:37.797
Huh?

39:37.817 --> 39:39.779
S-A-M-E.

39:40.419 --> 39:40.639
Yeah.

39:44.188 --> 39:44.408
Samae.

39:44.428 --> 39:44.669
Samae.

39:50.163 --> 39:50.643
BAU BAU!

39:50.703 --> 39:52.864
Maybe we need to get that rest, huh?

39:53.084 --> 39:56.264
And our schedule!

39:56.584 --> 40:05.726
On Saturday, starting at 6pm, it's gonna be a big special stream because we're having a Super Mario World in Dallas!

40:06.366 --> 40:14.067
And we're gonna be playing on the SNES with, you know, a cartridge that's even older than these Demon Dogs.

40:14.087 --> 40:14.448
Over 2,000 years old!

40:16.948 --> 40:19.850
Don't tell Nintendo about the really, really old cartridge.

40:19.970 --> 40:21.652
It's okay.

40:22.352 --> 40:25.695
And we're gonna be there for the very first time!

40:25.935 --> 40:29.318
Hasn't been done, not together with Mama Puppy.

40:29.358 --> 40:35.002
Yeah, there's been a lot of raging, so I shouldn't be even bored this time, huh?

40:35.523 --> 40:37.084
And hopefully the controller lives.

40:38.458 --> 40:39.378
As well as our fingers.

40:39.658 --> 40:41.158
BAU BAU!

40:42.219 --> 40:45.299
It's going to be our longest stream yet.

40:45.639 --> 40:49.000
We're amazing at it and sometimes we beat it.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.060
That would be kind of weird, wouldn't it?

40:51.880 --> 40:53.681
BAU BAU!

40:53.741 --> 41:04.383
And then on Sunday at 8pm PT, different from the schedule here, we're going to be having our Advent Off Club first anniversary stream!

41:04.663 --> 41:06.223
And after that, wait, it's a question mark?

41:07.863 --> 41:10.384
Maybe you can put together the pieces, maybe you can't.

41:10.984 --> 41:13.825
Either way, it'll be a great surprise!

41:13.865 --> 41:16.046
Surprise!

41:16.126 --> 41:18.127
Thank you, Ruffians!

41:19.147 --> 41:23.029
Thank you so much for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning.

41:23.709 --> 41:27.230
And Ruffians, you know who I want you to archive today.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.851
Here is your FUWAMOCO Award!

41:30.211 --> 41:33.372
It's BAU BAU brand new song!

41:33.472 --> 41:34.493
BAU BAU!

41:35.873 --> 41:44.217
BAU BAU, we hope you had a wonderful FUWAMOCO Morning together with us Ruffians!

41:52.181 --> 41:53.902
Sure, sure, sure.

41:53.982 --> 41:57.063
Feeling a bit more fluffy and fuzzy now.

41:58.103 --> 42:05.225
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

42:05.706 --> 42:08.166
See you on BAU BAU!

42:08.406 --> 42:09.147
Zura!

42:09.427 --> 42:10.107
BAU BAU!

42:10.467 --> 42:11.268
BAU BAU!

42:11.308 --> 42:12.088
Mofureko.

42:12.409 --> 42:13.710
BAU BAU!

42:13.970 --> 42:14.851
Sonic Mastix 2008.
