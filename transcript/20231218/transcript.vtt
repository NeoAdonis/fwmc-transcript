05:09.522 --> 05:11.764
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:12.264 --> 05:15.766
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.207 --> 05:20.109
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:20.149 --> 05:21.850
BAU BAU!

05:22.671 --> 05:25.853
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:26.374 --> 05:29.055
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:29.195 --> 05:31.957
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:32.057 --> 05:32.438
BAU BAU!

05:34.160 --> 05:38.546
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.648 --> 05:40.168
Thank you!

05:40.349 --> 05:41.250
Thank you!

05:41.831 --> 05:42.412
Thank you!

05:42.432 --> 05:45.917
For joining us for our 58th episode!

05:45.997 --> 05:46.438
BAU BAU!

05:48.681 --> 05:56.288
It's a new week, and a new FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:56.429 --> 06:03.476
And maybe if there's some new Ruffians joining us for the first time, we should explain what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

06:03.516 --> 06:04.056
We should.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.459
It would be wrong of us to continue without it.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.843
While FUWAMOCO Morning is short for that morning show,

06:11.684 --> 06:13.666
Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:13.966 --> 06:15.607
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:15.787 --> 06:19.090
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:19.650 --> 06:25.174
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:25.254 --> 06:25.695
Yeah!

06:26.115 --> 06:31.759
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:32.139 --> 06:36.623
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:36.723 --> 06:38.925
BAU BAU!

06:40.446 --> 06:42.067
Ruffians!

06:43.509 --> 06:45.291
BAU BAU!

06:46.112 --> 06:47.633
BAU BAU!

06:49.054 --> 06:54.800
Well, to start off this morning, there was yet another peron sighting!

06:55.060 --> 07:00.346
We have from a certain Ruffian, this!

07:02.168 --> 07:02.248
Oh!

07:04.608 --> 07:07.791
Pero's become a digital desktop buddy!

07:08.411 --> 07:09.412
That's cute!

07:09.672 --> 07:12.355
Yeah, it's kind of oddly fitting for him, no?

07:12.375 --> 07:13.155
Right?

07:13.255 --> 07:13.756
Yeah.

07:13.876 --> 07:15.157
He looks good on digital.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.058
I like it.

07:16.378 --> 07:17.299
Very cute.

07:17.539 --> 07:25.866
Sometimes, you know, Ruffians, we have questions when it comes to things on the computer, so it'd be great to get some advice from someone.

07:26.026 --> 07:26.466
Someone!

07:26.587 --> 07:27.748
Anyone!

07:27.828 --> 07:30.110
I guess someone maybe we're a bit familiar with.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.432
You know, when we're unsure, right?

07:32.472 --> 07:32.612
Yeah.

07:34.167 --> 07:39.429
It seems like Pero is suggesting to this Ruffian that they do some updates.

07:39.549 --> 07:40.730
Formatting their hard drives.

07:40.770 --> 07:41.230
Yeah.

07:41.410 --> 07:44.731
Sometimes my cu-cu-cu-cu-computer.

07:45.131 --> 07:45.772
Computer.

07:46.172 --> 07:47.972
It asks for updates too.

07:48.012 --> 07:48.613
Right.

07:48.673 --> 07:49.793
You know, I'm pretty kind.

07:49.853 --> 07:51.474
I do the updates regularly.

07:51.774 --> 07:53.715
Formatting the hard drive too.

07:53.975 --> 07:56.296
We've actually never done that before.

07:56.756 --> 07:58.156
It never asked me to do that.

07:58.176 --> 07:59.157
Are we behind?

08:00.037 --> 08:02.158
Should we do that sometime, Ruffians?

08:02.338 --> 08:05.760
Actually, you know, we really need to organize all our files.

08:05.820 --> 08:12.783
I think we talked about it before, but maybe we'll do that sometime together with you Ruffians and then we can format our hard drive after.

08:12.903 --> 08:13.344
Right!

08:13.364 --> 08:16.185
Does that sound like a good plan?

08:16.205 --> 08:16.965
Yeah!

08:17.746 --> 08:23.909
And then, you know, everything can be fresh and ready for us to go afterwards for the new year.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.493
But that's really kind of Pero to help you out with that.

08:29.633 --> 08:30.634
Nice advice.

08:30.734 --> 08:36.278
Right, but she's usually so nasty, but... BAU BAU!

08:36.298 --> 08:39.000
That's a nice Pero sign.

08:39.481 --> 08:40.642
It's been a while, huh?

08:40.702 --> 08:42.703
Yeah, a little while, right?

08:43.284 --> 08:46.126
But... Ruffians.

08:46.206 --> 08:47.787
RuffianS!

08:47.807 --> 08:52.111
We have some really, really happy, happy news!

08:52.779 --> 08:56.192
Wow, Ruffians, it's serious.

08:59.265 --> 09:00.046
You might know.

09:00.586 --> 09:04.009
You might know already, but... We still really can't believe it.

09:04.189 --> 09:11.114
But thanks to all your support, it seems like we won the League of their Own category at the VTuber Awards!

09:11.154 --> 09:14.557
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

09:14.657 --> 09:17.799
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

09:17.919 --> 09:19.381
Thank you!

09:19.661 --> 09:21.302
We're so honored and amazed.

09:21.923 --> 09:25.145
There are some really amazing VTubers that we are competing with.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.427
And you know, we're just newbies.

09:29.281 --> 09:32.063
We're really happy to just be nominated, you know?

09:32.844 --> 09:37.528
But we somehow won thanks to all your support and votes.

09:37.648 --> 09:38.449
Thank you!

09:38.529 --> 09:39.590
Thank you!

09:39.910 --> 09:50.519
We're not the super competitive type, but we hope that this award will maybe put some more eyes on us and to what we've been doing and, you know, maybe some big ones too.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.292
Hopefully!

09:52.312 --> 09:58.256
You know, because there are a lot of very talented and amazing members and senpai within hololive, you know?

09:58.676 --> 10:04.620
So, we want to make sure that we can stand out and stand on our own two!

10:04.661 --> 10:11.545
We're going to work really hard, continue to work really hard, and hopefully we can stand out a bit.

10:11.625 --> 10:17.590
Maybe it's silly, you know, because we're twins and maybe you think that we stand out already, but...

10:19.546 --> 10:21.247
We're gonna do our best, okay?

10:22.347 --> 10:23.787
Thank you!

10:24.148 --> 10:26.568
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

10:26.648 --> 10:29.269
BAU BAU!

10:30.349 --> 10:31.050
Thank you!

10:31.830 --> 10:32.490
BAU BAU!

10:39.232 --> 10:42.494
And other happy advent news!

10:42.614 --> 10:43.655
Nerissa!

10:44.035 --> 10:51.520
Nerissa's new song cover of Idolmaster's Shiny Colors S.O.S is now on!

10:51.540 --> 10:52.741
Ruffians!

10:52.821 --> 10:53.762
Have you listened?

10:54.382 --> 10:55.863
Go listen, Ruffians!

10:56.323 --> 10:58.385
No, it's Nerissa's cutest cover yet!

11:00.436 --> 11:01.436
It's so good, right?

11:01.456 --> 11:02.617
It's so good!

11:02.717 --> 11:05.098
I love it when she gets all pouty, too.

11:05.638 --> 11:05.878
Yeah.

11:05.898 --> 11:06.298
So cute!

11:06.358 --> 11:14.922
But yeah, it's Nerissa's most idly sounding cover yet, so it's really cute to get to hear a different side of her and her voice.

11:15.022 --> 11:15.562
Yeah.

11:15.602 --> 11:24.546
And you know, previously she just released a more operatic song, like Lilium, and now it's such a cute idol pop song, like S.O.S.

11:25.006 --> 11:27.947
Going from those two, it's really definitely something else.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.228
Wow.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.498
Has to be Nerissa.

11:31.698 --> 11:33.899
Has to be Nerissa.

11:33.979 --> 11:35.860
She's so amazing.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.761
Such a versatile voice.

11:38.122 --> 11:40.083
Please go check it out on GamerFu.

11:40.203 --> 11:40.903
It's so good.

11:40.923 --> 11:41.564
BAU BAU!

11:47.034 --> 11:52.958
Lots of amazing things have been happening to you, but not just within Advent, though.

11:53.718 --> 11:55.439
Kiara-senpai!

11:55.640 --> 12:01.403
Ruffians, did you check out Kiara-senpai's 3D Birthday at the end of year live?

12:02.444 --> 12:02.804
Did you?

12:02.944 --> 12:03.965
Did you?

12:04.205 --> 12:06.126
It happened over the weekend!

12:06.707 --> 12:09.389
In full 3D with lots of guests, too.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.991
You know, we really wanted to stay up to watch it live, but...

12:13.683 --> 12:14.003
BAU BAU!

12:14.023 --> 12:14.443
BAU BAU!

12:14.483 --> 12:15.203
BAU BAU!

12:15.223 --> 12:15.843
BAU BAU!

12:15.903 --> 12:16.203
BAU BAU!

12:42.888 --> 12:45.469
I sometimes sing it at karaoke too.

12:45.549 --> 12:51.272
So it was really cool to see it performed with the original choreography too.

12:51.793 --> 13:01.958
I really like Noble Kiss too, but I think my favorite was probably Kiara-senpai and Calli-senpai's performance of their new original song together, Fire and Ice.

13:02.578 --> 13:08.660
You know, I just felt like there's a very special bond that I could see that they shared as they sang and danced it together.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.480
So that was my favorite part.

13:11.180 --> 13:14.961
But you know, the choreography was also very cool and very cute.

13:15.541 --> 13:19.102
I thought it was appropriate for, you know, fire and ice.

13:19.142 --> 13:19.442
Me too!

13:22.399 --> 13:22.820
BAU BAU!

13:22.880 --> 13:23.380
BAU BAU!

13:44.721 --> 13:45.461
Wow.

13:45.502 --> 13:46.422
Ruffians.

13:46.922 --> 13:51.165
I think this is maybe the third time we've talked about this on FUWAMOCO Morning.

13:51.225 --> 13:51.966
What does that mean?

13:53.075 --> 13:54.616
Is that a bad thing or a good thing?

13:54.676 --> 13:55.756
No, it's a good thing.

13:56.176 --> 14:07.061
But Ruffians, you might know that recently hololive has opened up a pop-up shop in Tokyo Station's very famous Character Street.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.622
We talked about it before.

14:09.662 --> 14:11.203
You should maybe know.

14:11.503 --> 14:11.883
Yeah!

14:12.383 --> 14:13.724
And I'm enjoying it this summer!

14:14.904 --> 14:16.665
Ruffians, you know, you know that

14:41.391 --> 14:45.714
You really wanted to get your paws on them, but it's kind of tricky.

14:45.835 --> 14:46.675
It's tricky, huh?

14:46.715 --> 14:51.859
Yeah, you need to kind of be in Japan, and then you need to be really lucky too.

14:52.540 --> 14:53.441
But you know it.

14:53.461 --> 15:03.649
It seems, just seems, just seems, that there have been some Ruffians taking matters into their own paws.

15:04.810 --> 15:09.013
And have been picking them up on second-hand resale sites.

15:09.294 --> 15:10.434
Ruffians.

15:12.335 --> 15:12.956
What are you doing?

15:14.096 --> 15:16.999
It says, no resale!

15:17.019 --> 15:21.702
There's supposed to be special treasures to say thank you for your purchase!

15:21.783 --> 15:29.949
You know, at the very least, you should trade with others to get your ornament, and not buying it from places like that, right?

15:29.989 --> 15:30.449
Right?

15:30.910 --> 15:33.792
But you know, I get it.

15:33.852 --> 15:39.477
When you're overseas and can't actually go there in person, but you really really want it, but...

15:40.836 --> 15:49.025
I get it, but... But still... Actually, Moco-chan.

15:49.045 --> 15:54.892
It seems that Advent has been putting a high price together, like, as a set.

15:54.952 --> 15:55.132
Yeah.

16:09.298 --> 16:10.478
Oh, Moco-chan, can you tell me?

16:10.498 --> 16:13.840
Can you BAU me?

16:14.400 --> 16:15.740
Yup, I'll just... Oh.

16:18.741 --> 16:18.921
Oh!

16:19.342 --> 16:19.942
This much.

16:20.702 --> 16:21.102
Hoi!

16:21.142 --> 16:26.124
What the heck?

16:26.864 --> 16:34.707
And, uh, us, like, FUWAMOCO, as it's said together, was... Hoi!

16:35.951 --> 16:36.812
Ruffians!

16:37.912 --> 16:38.392
Hi!

16:38.753 --> 16:40.374
Please, please.

16:40.934 --> 16:44.676
Just take it easy until you can get proper merchandise, okay?

16:45.496 --> 16:45.977
Okay.

16:49.338 --> 16:49.819
Got it.

16:50.579 --> 16:53.000
You know it.

16:53.601 --> 16:56.382
Something might be just around the corner.

16:56.703 --> 16:57.163
Something.

16:57.423 --> 16:58.123
Something.

16:58.423 --> 16:59.024
Something.

16:59.624 --> 17:00.705
Okay, no Ruffians.

17:02.426 --> 17:03.246
Can you guess?

17:04.007 --> 17:04.407
Christmas.

17:11.442 --> 17:17.868
Birthday!

17:18.148 --> 17:20.990
Just remember these cards are supposed to be presents, okay?

17:21.231 --> 17:23.192
Not reselling, okay?

17:23.953 --> 17:24.514
Got it?

17:25.314 --> 17:25.875
Got it.

17:25.955 --> 17:26.355
BAU BAU!

17:34.061 --> 17:38.527
But you know, I'm happy that the Ruffians are so excited and passionate too.

17:38.948 --> 17:39.309
I get it.

17:43.611 --> 17:49.456
Well, Moco-chan, actually we got a very important scoop from a FUWAMOCO fan!

17:49.936 --> 17:51.258
A FUWAMOCO scoop?

17:51.278 --> 17:51.778
Yeah!

17:52.238 --> 17:55.501
Thank you FUWAMOCO fan for the very good journalism.

17:55.862 --> 17:56.042
A++++.

17:56.082 --> 17:58.864
Well, let's take a look at our scoop here.

17:59.425 --> 18:00.726
Let's see, we have...

18:06.324 --> 18:06.424
Oh!

18:07.284 --> 18:07.844
Oh no.

18:09.225 --> 18:10.105
Oh no.

18:11.245 --> 18:20.387
It looks like Matsuri-senpai... Matsuri-senpai has come down with a bad case of BAU BAU BYOU.

18:21.387 --> 18:22.947
Oh no, Ruffians!

18:23.687 --> 18:25.388
What are we gonna do, huh?

18:26.548 --> 18:28.828
We still don't have a cure for BAU BAU BYOU, huh?

18:29.028 --> 18:30.809
It's been how many months now?

18:31.249 --> 18:32.189
Five months?

18:34.278 --> 18:38.860
Well, not only has she been making a number of questionable tweets.

18:38.920 --> 18:43.062
Yeah, like, uh, saying she wants to give birth to FUWAMOCO.

18:43.082 --> 18:45.163
Yeah, but- Whatever that means!

18:45.183 --> 18:59.790
She's also been caught popping into our super chat reading just the other day, too, and, uh, she also said on a stream, Ruffians, uh, Ko-chan, you read it.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.131
Oh, why do I have to read it?

19:01.151 --> 19:02.692
I don't want to read it, it's embarrassing.

19:04.093 --> 19:06.094
Moco-chan, what did Matsuri-senpai say?

19:10.955 --> 19:13.736
She said... Do I have to say it in her words?

19:13.756 --> 19:15.477
I have to say it in her words?

19:17.758 --> 19:19.138
I really wanna kiss them.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.659
Kiss me, FUWAMOCO.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.040
Oh my gosh, Ruffians!

19:28.701 --> 19:29.862
Ruffians!

19:31.502 --> 19:35.045
What should we do to help Matsuri-senpai's BAU BAU feel?

19:35.065 --> 19:36.366
I don't know!

19:38.248 --> 19:39.469
What should we do, huh?

19:39.489 --> 19:45.054
Do you know?

19:46.015 --> 19:47.436
Avoid at all costs.

19:47.856 --> 19:50.319
It's not gonna make the problem better.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.180
It's incurable.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.743
I see some very bad advice.

19:56.124 --> 19:56.965
Very bad advice.

19:56.985 --> 19:58.286
I see some bad advice too.

20:04.106 --> 20:06.687
Ask Bae-senpai for advice.

20:08.247 --> 20:09.347
That might be a good idea.

20:09.427 --> 20:11.128
Bae-senpai has very good advice.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.788
Based on the Ruffians.

20:14.228 --> 20:16.229
But the Ruffians gave us that advice.

20:18.389 --> 20:18.749
I don't know.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.810
I don't know, yeah.

20:21.310 --> 20:22.030
She needs help.

20:22.470 --> 20:23.611
She needs help.

20:24.051 --> 20:25.411
Maybe we'll ask Bae-senpai.

20:28.254 --> 20:29.514
BAU BAU!

20:29.594 --> 20:31.175
Hopefully she's okay.

20:32.755 --> 20:33.295
Hopefully.

20:33.335 --> 20:35.316
BAU BAU!

20:35.336 --> 20:39.497
Wow, Ruffians.

20:40.257 --> 20:44.878
I just kinda asked the Ruffians for help, but... We need your help again!

20:44.898 --> 20:48.038
We need it again!

20:48.919 --> 20:51.179
I know.

20:51.239 --> 20:52.439
Sooner than our birthday.

20:52.499 --> 20:54.280
Sooner than our birthday?

20:55.677 --> 20:59.740
Christmas is coming up really soon, right?

21:00.180 --> 21:02.482
Really soon!

21:02.502 --> 21:03.382
Yeah.

21:03.683 --> 21:06.605
Well, we wanted to share something really... Oh.

21:07.686 --> 21:07.886
No.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.667
We don't want to share something with you.

21:10.067 --> 21:13.890
We need you to share something really important with us!

21:13.910 --> 21:18.113
Moco-chan, please make sure you don't get your words all mixed up, okay?

21:18.213 --> 21:18.753
Coming from you!

21:22.509 --> 21:25.390
We need you to share something with us!

21:25.470 --> 21:25.850
Yes!

21:25.890 --> 21:27.111
Something very personal, okay?

21:27.131 --> 21:27.831
Important!

21:27.851 --> 21:30.332
You have to reminisce a bit, okay?

21:30.732 --> 21:31.152
Is that okay?

21:31.172 --> 21:32.653
Are you good with that?

21:34.013 --> 21:35.974
Well... What?

21:36.034 --> 21:37.894
Personal, but... No.

21:38.295 --> 21:38.515
No.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.775
Reminisce, okay?

21:41.016 --> 21:41.836
Yeah.

21:43.276 --> 21:44.817
Yeah, well, Ruffians!

21:45.497 --> 21:47.718
We wanted to... to hear...

21:51.048 --> 21:58.159
We wanted to hear some of your favorite holiday Christmas memories.

21:58.419 --> 21:59.240
Yeah!

22:00.181 --> 22:01.423
Please share them with us.

22:05.583 --> 22:08.744
Well, we opened up a Google Form.

22:08.784 --> 22:12.826
And that way, you can share them with us there!

22:13.166 --> 22:16.188
We only have a few simple rules though.

22:16.608 --> 22:24.571
We'd like to ask that your memory... I know it's hard sometimes to have good memories that are very robust.

22:24.731 --> 22:28.273
But we'd like to ask that your memory be around 150 to 500 words.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.614
So it's not too long.

22:33.095 --> 22:36.737
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

22:51.707 --> 22:52.888
Not so much violence.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.649
A little violence.

22:55.029 --> 22:59.951
And try to avoid any third-party IPs and alarms.

22:59.971 --> 23:08.596
So if maybe there's a whole live member that's a good part of your Christmas memories, then that's okay.

23:08.636 --> 23:11.958
Hopefully we can be that one tonight, Moco-chan.

23:11.978 --> 23:13.799
Yeah!

23:14.219 --> 23:17.941
We'll do our best to read as many of your memories as possible, but

23:21.222 --> 23:27.704
But you have until Saturday, December 23rd at 6pm PT to submit yours, okay?

23:28.845 --> 23:29.745
You have a bit of time.

23:29.965 --> 23:31.065
A bit of time.

23:31.426 --> 23:37.148
We'll share the link in the description and on Twitter as well, so please get writing, okay, Ruffians?

23:37.448 --> 23:38.688
You know, it could be anything.

23:38.768 --> 23:42.470
Yeah, you know, a good memory helping out.

23:42.550 --> 23:43.190
Dinner!

23:43.650 --> 23:44.171
Sounds good!

24:07.853 --> 24:08.373
Guess what?

24:08.413 --> 24:12.474
We have some more good news.

24:13.315 --> 24:16.236
It looks like there's been

24:35.037 --> 24:38.118
No misunderstandings!

24:38.999 --> 24:43.941
Except for the, you know, fact that we kind of forgot that there was no misunderstandings last time.

24:43.961 --> 24:48.343
So, uh, two days without misunderstandings.

24:48.363 --> 24:48.783
Yeah!

24:48.803 --> 24:52.285
New record, right?

24:52.325 --> 24:52.565
Yeah!

24:52.625 --> 24:53.886
New high score!

24:53.926 --> 24:57.127
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

25:02.759 --> 25:07.884
Why?

25:08.304 --> 25:13.549
But you know, even we, we went through lethal company with no misunderstandings.

25:13.690 --> 25:18.795
Even a very silly rock n' roll party, no misunderstandings!

25:20.770 --> 25:24.411
It's that time of the week.

25:24.431 --> 25:27.791
That time of the week where Moco-chan challenges herself.

25:50.731 --> 25:54.560
To some delicious NANTA!

25:56.264 --> 25:59.351
Moco-chan, you know, she's been doing very, uh...

26:01.403 --> 26:05.486
I'm doing my best to eat natto.

26:06.026 --> 26:06.927
Natto!

26:06.967 --> 26:12.431
For Ruffians who aren't quite familiar, natto is a very popular breakfast food in Japan.

26:13.131 --> 26:14.432
It's really good for you.

26:14.612 --> 26:15.633
Very healthy.

26:15.973 --> 26:24.959
Lots of vitamins, but it's also a little sticky and slimy and a bit strong smelling.

26:25.299 --> 26:27.621
Last week I did very well.

26:29.028 --> 26:31.670
Well, we used the new secret technique.

26:32.850 --> 26:33.571
Sesame oil.

26:33.671 --> 26:34.611
Sesame oil.

26:34.752 --> 26:35.032
Yeah.

26:35.632 --> 26:38.054
So... And last time I ate three.

26:38.074 --> 26:38.814
Three beans.

26:38.834 --> 26:39.535
Three beans.

26:39.575 --> 26:40.035
Yeah.

26:40.075 --> 26:43.917
So this time, Ruffians, I have prepared the sesame oil.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.659
Do you have confidence in me, Ruffians?

26:47.840 --> 26:48.340
Hai.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.042
Hai.

26:51.182 --> 26:56.105
Moco-chan, today I would like you to eat, like, a lot of beans.

26:57.082 --> 26:57.383
BAU BAU!

27:07.031 --> 27:11.974
Okay, well, last time I felt like I put a bit too much sesame oil in it.

27:12.354 --> 27:15.256
But I think I'll put a bit too much.

27:15.276 --> 27:17.077
I am treating, okay?

27:17.097 --> 27:19.239
Okay, that's... Okay.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.060
It's kind of swimming.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.962
Not dory swimming, okay?

27:24.042 --> 27:25.903
It's swimming in the oil now.

27:26.463 --> 27:27.524
This should be good.

27:28.064 --> 27:28.345
Yeah.

27:29.285 --> 27:30.106
Oh, it's dripping.

27:30.646 --> 27:30.907
How?

27:30.927 --> 27:32.968
There's a hole in it.

27:32.988 --> 27:34.229
There's a hole in it!

27:34.269 --> 27:35.050
That's a first.

27:35.591 --> 27:36.852
I'm getting oily.

27:36.912 --> 27:39.074
Oh gosh, it's dripping all over me!

27:40.495 --> 27:41.956
It's getting on my skirt.

27:42.076 --> 27:42.216
Oh no.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.991
There's natto and sesame oil everywhere.

27:50.011 --> 27:51.692
Moco-chan.

27:52.232 --> 27:53.532
How did this happen?

27:53.652 --> 27:54.413
What did you do?

27:54.433 --> 27:56.253
What the heck?

27:56.293 --> 27:57.714
Did you hurt the packaging?

27:57.734 --> 27:59.395
I didn't hurt it.

27:59.455 --> 28:01.815
Maybe the natto, they wanted to escape.

28:01.835 --> 28:03.936
That's it.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.157
Well, Moco-chan.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.178
What is this?

28:09.678 --> 28:11.879
I think this is really nice and fluffy now.

28:13.500 --> 28:13.940
But Moco-chan.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.221
For some reason, it looks worse than last week.

28:17.409 --> 28:18.850
What are we gonna do this time?

28:18.870 --> 28:20.430
What do you mean?

28:20.870 --> 28:25.572
Before you challenge yourself- I don't eat the open package food, that's what I feel.

28:25.592 --> 28:26.453
Ha!

28:26.953 --> 28:29.334
If the package was injured then we shouldn't eat it.

28:29.354 --> 28:30.254
Oh no.

28:30.955 --> 28:31.455
It's fine.

28:37.609 --> 28:40.111
Don't say the Ruffians, it's fine!

28:40.131 --> 28:42.153
Okay, Moco-chan!

28:42.533 --> 28:47.098
Last time it was very rude and you didn't say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi.

28:47.558 --> 28:55.126
So this time you need to say an extra, extra big thank you to the farmers in Tochigi for all your hard work.

28:55.966 --> 28:56.727
Thank you.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.389
That's pretty small, Moco-chan.

28:58.409 --> 28:59.290
Thank you.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.231
That's still pretty small.

29:00.251 --> 29:02.914
Tochigi Farmers and Sesame Oil Farmers.

29:02.934 --> 29:06.959
Sesame Oil Farmers too, yeah?

29:07.159 --> 29:07.760
Thank you.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.383
Oh, this looks pretty delicious, Moco-chan.

29:10.403 --> 29:12.585
I'm excited for you.

29:14.187 --> 29:14.788
Yeah.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.450
Wow, that's a big oily puddle!

29:18.151 --> 29:20.453
I don't want... I don't want oil all over me.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.553
You're good, Moco-chan.

29:21.774 --> 29:23.495
I don't want oil all over me.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.176
Where's the hole on it?

29:25.396 --> 29:27.037
Where is the hole on it?

29:27.117 --> 29:27.598
It's here.

29:27.698 --> 29:28.278
Oh, okay.

29:29.759 --> 29:31.120
Why is it like that?

29:31.220 --> 29:32.581
I'm just covered in it.

29:32.681 --> 29:34.863
I think that's suspicious.

29:35.223 --> 29:36.644
Then it doesn't look like we made it.

29:36.904 --> 29:38.145
No, it's... I made it.

29:38.185 --> 29:38.526
It's fine.

29:39.326 --> 29:39.746
It's fine.

29:40.147 --> 29:40.587
It's fine.

29:41.167 --> 29:46.650
It's fine.

29:49.792 --> 29:51.133
Okay, Moco-chan!

29:52.374 --> 29:53.995
Don't take one bean at a time.

29:54.035 --> 29:55.056
You can do all of them.

29:55.076 --> 29:57.677
I will take one bean at a time, thank you.

29:57.697 --> 29:59.318
You can do it, okay?

29:59.358 --> 30:03.661
For some reason, I don't think this is as good as last week.

30:03.681 --> 30:04.341
Two at a time.

30:04.361 --> 30:05.462
Oh no, it's even better.

30:06.829 --> 30:09.451
I'm gonna try two at once, okay?

30:09.471 --> 30:13.234
I'm being ambitious, okay, Ruffians?

30:13.414 --> 30:14.435
Understand, okay?

30:15.496 --> 30:15.876
Chug?

30:15.896 --> 30:17.518
This is natto.

30:18.799 --> 30:19.519
Oh gosh.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.841
What's up?

30:21.881 --> 30:23.522
What's up?

30:23.562 --> 30:24.083
What's up?

30:27.726 --> 30:32.950
Okay, I couldn't have it, okay?

30:34.371 --> 30:35.192
I don't need to do it.

30:36.064 --> 30:36.864
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:36.884 --> 30:37.604
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:37.704 --> 30:38.104
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:38.124 --> 30:38.465
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:39.125 --> 30:39.585
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:39.605 --> 30:40.345
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:40.365 --> 30:41.905
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:42.085 --> 30:42.525
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:42.545 --> 30:43.125
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:43.306 --> 30:44.166
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:44.186 --> 30:44.746
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:46.126 --> 30:46.626
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:46.646 --> 30:49.607
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:50.047 --> 30:50.767
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:51.127 --> 30:51.707
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:52.127 --> 30:52.647
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:52.667 --> 30:53.448
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:53.468 --> 30:53.948
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:54.008 --> 30:55.228
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:55.248 --> 30:55.628
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:55.648 --> 30:55.988
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:56.008 --> 30:56.728
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:56.748 --> 30:57.108
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:57.128 --> 30:57.589
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:57.609 --> 30:57.949
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:57.969 --> 31:03.970
FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:03.990 --> 31:04.470
FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:04.490 --> 31:04.590
FUWAM

31:05.336 --> 31:05.956
Got two!

31:06.297 --> 31:09.519
That's two right from the start, Ruffians!

31:10.960 --> 31:11.681
Ambitious!

31:11.981 --> 31:12.782
Ambitious!

31:13.182 --> 31:13.682
Ambitious!

31:13.722 --> 31:15.224
Can you take, like, more?

31:15.244 --> 31:16.845
No, I'm taking another two!

31:16.865 --> 31:19.087
I'm gonna take another two.

31:20.788 --> 31:21.408
Ambitious.

31:21.669 --> 31:23.270
This is gonna take a while, Ruffians.

31:23.370 --> 31:24.311
I wanna see a lot.

31:25.011 --> 31:26.232
Can you do, like, 15 today?

31:26.392 --> 31:29.555
Why is she doing well?

31:29.575 --> 31:30.756
Can I have some water?

31:30.956 --> 31:31.176
No!

31:31.836 --> 31:32.097
Go!

31:34.216 --> 31:34.496
No!

31:34.536 --> 31:34.977
Girl!

31:35.517 --> 31:37.559
I won a Vtuber award!

31:38.339 --> 31:40.161
You're still gonna eat the natto, okay?

31:40.181 --> 31:42.002
I'm gonna have two more!

31:43.283 --> 31:44.564
Here I go, Ruffians!

31:44.584 --> 31:52.089
Moco-chan, why?

31:52.390 --> 31:54.931
Why are you making that face now, huh?

31:56.052 --> 31:56.933
Oh, oh, oh!

32:00.421 --> 32:02.423
Come on, don't make a pain face.

32:04.184 --> 32:05.325
Moco-chan, no, no, no.

32:05.625 --> 32:06.566
That's four.

32:06.586 --> 32:08.087
No, no, that one was tough.

32:08.147 --> 32:09.028
That one was tough.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.309
One more.

32:10.349 --> 32:11.590
No, no, no.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.411
My mouth is all sticky, no.

32:13.431 --> 32:18.755
This creature's suffering.

32:19.175 --> 32:20.937
It's good, Ruffians.

32:21.337 --> 32:23.639
It's extra oily too, Moco-chan.

32:23.659 --> 32:25.900
I feel bad for the natto.

32:30.916 --> 32:34.598
Well, I guess that was a good attempt at a new high record!

32:35.258 --> 32:36.139
High score!

32:36.739 --> 32:37.379
Four beans.

32:37.459 --> 32:39.700
It's just one bean more, but I guess I'll accept it.

32:40.661 --> 32:41.341
Good.

32:42.022 --> 32:42.562
Good job.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.543
Good job.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.244
I'm proud, but I want you to eat more, okay?

32:49.330 --> 32:50.571
BAU BAU!

32:50.871 --> 32:54.754
Remember, Ruffians, it's the start of a new week, so you can do it!

32:55.014 --> 32:58.357
Challenge yourself to something new, too, just like Moco-chan.

32:58.657 --> 33:03.221
Maybe it doesn't go smoothly, but if it goes, it goes!

33:03.901 --> 33:06.103
BAU BAU!

33:06.744 --> 33:11.467
Now, let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day!

33:11.568 --> 33:14.270
The Doggie of the Day is De-den!

33:16.132 --> 33:22.919
She's so cute!

33:23.280 --> 33:26.443
This is the Ruffian's sister's doggy!

33:27.004 --> 33:29.066
Look at her with the cute toy!

33:29.347 --> 33:30.568
It's a piggy!

33:31.009 --> 33:32.631
A doggy and a piggy!

33:33.772 --> 33:35.514
It looks more like a rhino though.

33:36.154 --> 33:37.915
I don't know.

33:38.295 --> 33:45.058
Apparently she's a bit of a bonehead, but it's okay because you know she has a heart of gold.

33:45.598 --> 33:48.199
As long as the heart is good.

33:48.719 --> 33:51.681
How are those bones in BAU BAU?

33:51.881 --> 33:54.962
Like a... BAU BAU with the squeaky toy.

33:54.982 --> 33:56.103
BAU BAU!

33:56.163 --> 33:57.483
BAU BAU!

33:58.023 --> 33:59.304
Is that the squeaky toy?

33:59.384 --> 34:00.624
That's the squeaky toy.

34:00.645 --> 34:02.125
What if it's like, BAU BAU!

34:02.165 --> 34:02.645
BAU BAU!

34:02.685 --> 34:02.745
No.

34:05.802 --> 34:06.903
I think mine was the best.

34:06.923 --> 34:11.669
I put in a creaky mouth full of salad.

34:12.130 --> 34:12.991
Yeah.

34:13.191 --> 34:13.692
Again.

34:13.852 --> 34:14.072
Again.

34:14.092 --> 34:14.332
BAU BAU!

34:20.387 --> 34:20.907
I don't know.

34:21.267 --> 34:23.708
That sounds like a car starting up on a cold day.

34:23.788 --> 34:25.689
BAU BAU!

34:25.729 --> 34:26.790
BAU BAU!

34:26.970 --> 34:28.991
Oh, you know, Rosy!

34:29.051 --> 34:32.152
Rosy's a cutie with a very cute rosy nose.

34:32.272 --> 34:33.052
Right!

34:34.173 --> 34:36.594
She's a little bit of a troublemaker maybe, but...

34:37.114 --> 34:41.456
That's also what makes her as lovable as she is, you know?

34:41.476 --> 34:44.157
She just wants to enjoy life together with her family.

34:44.177 --> 34:48.620
Even if that maybe means a little bit of mischief.

34:49.120 --> 34:49.600
It's okay.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.721
A little bit of mischief is okay.

34:52.822 --> 34:54.622
BAU BAU!

34:54.662 --> 34:57.384
Today!

34:57.844 --> 35:00.865
Ruffians, where have you been going for walks?

35:01.286 --> 35:01.506
I see.

35:01.566 --> 35:02.106
De-den!

35:04.468 --> 35:05.829
What?!

35:05.889 --> 35:06.950
Oh my gosh!

35:08.031 --> 35:09.892
Christmas fireworks!

35:09.912 --> 35:10.733
Amazing!

35:10.833 --> 35:12.434
And what such a nice photo!

35:12.815 --> 35:13.555
I know what's that.

35:13.615 --> 35:14.936
The tree right there in the front.

35:14.956 --> 35:16.398
Moco-chan, the tree.

35:16.418 --> 35:19.580
So it's supposed to be taken away from the fireworks.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.141
It looks like a Christmas tree.

35:21.982 --> 35:23.503
I guess that's one way to look at it.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.004
Yeah.

35:24.024 --> 35:25.885
They're breathtaking with the tree there.

35:27.467 --> 35:28.687
It's a good outlook.

35:28.708 --> 35:29.708
Thank you!

35:29.808 --> 35:34.092
Thank you for sharing a little bit of your world with us.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.013
I wish we could've been there too.

35:36.453 --> 35:39.294
We were there with you in your heart.

35:39.755 --> 35:42.216
BAU BAU!

35:42.756 --> 35:48.939
And next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

35:49.259 --> 35:50.480
Hi FUWAMOCO!

35:51.160 --> 35:57.063
It's been cold since the beginning of December, and Christmas Day is getting closer and closer.

35:57.703 --> 35:59.464
I'm looking forward to it!

35:59.744 --> 36:05.027
My question is, what flavor or type of cake do you two like to eat on Christmas Day?

36:05.428 --> 36:07.049
Or which kind would you prefer?

36:07.089 --> 36:09.230
Good question.

36:09.350 --> 36:11.651
This is a good question, yeah.

36:11.911 --> 36:13.532
We really like dessert.

36:13.592 --> 36:14.253
Did you know?

36:14.533 --> 36:21.937
Yeah, I know, but we actually don't typically eat cake with Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy on Christmas in the Northwest Passage.

36:22.037 --> 36:24.439
Yeah, it's a bit surprising, right?

36:24.919 --> 36:26.360
But I think for cake,

36:27.939 --> 36:31.043
Ice cream cake.

36:34.117 --> 36:37.698
You know, especially when it's just a solid slab of ice cream.

36:37.898 --> 36:42.759
You know it's ice cream, but you add the word cake onto it because it kind of looks like a cake.

36:42.779 --> 36:43.840
It's in a cake shape.

36:44.060 --> 36:46.120
Yeah.

36:46.180 --> 36:49.261
But for the cake cakes, not ice cream.

36:49.341 --> 36:49.781
Cake cakes.

36:50.201 --> 36:51.461
Actual cake cake.

36:52.102 --> 36:54.982
Cheesecake is yummy too.

36:55.022 --> 36:55.242
Yeah!

36:55.342 --> 36:56.223
But cheese is gross.

36:56.503 --> 36:57.603
But cheesecake is cake.

36:57.943 --> 36:59.804
Cheesecake is yummy, cheese is gross.

37:03.527 --> 37:04.168
That makes sense.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.310
It makes sense, right.

37:05.370 --> 37:06.112
Do you agree?

37:06.132 --> 37:11.221
One more question, like, uh, what is weird with that?

37:11.241 --> 37:12.243
Cheese is gross.

37:12.363 --> 37:13.545
Cheesecake is good.

37:13.565 --> 37:13.906
Yeah.

37:13.926 --> 37:14.026
Yeah.

37:14.507 --> 37:15.849
Yeah, it makes sense.

37:16.210 --> 37:16.610
Agreed.

37:19.179 --> 37:20.880
BAU BAU!

37:21.260 --> 37:24.282
Thank you, Ruffians, again for everything.

37:25.062 --> 37:28.584
All your doggies, all your questions, your scoops too.

37:28.624 --> 37:31.686
Don't forget to use the hashtag, hashtag FUWAMOCO scoop.

37:31.846 --> 37:32.946
F3S scoop.

37:33.527 --> 37:36.028
And for your other submissions.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.389
But we have homework for you.

37:38.630 --> 37:39.570
Don't forget your homework.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.392
We continue to ask a lot of the Ruffians, huh?

37:43.172 --> 37:43.552
We're good!

37:43.632 --> 37:45.674
Thank you, Ruffians!

37:45.794 --> 37:52.940
Thank you for always being a very important part of everything we do.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.161
BAU BAU!

37:55.102 --> 37:59.865
And next we have our upcoming stream, which is tonight!

37:59.885 --> 38:02.147
Tonight we have... De-den!

38:06.014 --> 38:13.738
We're playing the newest Chilla's Art game, but Ruffians, this time I think it's really really really scary.

38:13.758 --> 38:16.479
I think it's seriously scary.

38:17.160 --> 38:17.600
Yeah.

38:18.220 --> 38:21.862
You know, some of them, they weren't that bad.

38:23.103 --> 38:26.144
But this time I'm really worried.

38:26.645 --> 38:26.925
Yeah.

38:28.189 --> 38:31.675
I'm not good at the dark stuff with the flashlight.

38:32.115 --> 38:35.481
But there is a very cute Tanuki!

38:43.206 --> 38:44.627
BAU BAU!

38:44.647 --> 38:52.433
And our schedule!

38:52.953 --> 38:57.797
This week we have a lot of exciting plans, especially as we get closer to Christmas.

38:58.197 --> 39:05.923
But for the first time ever, we're gonna be releasing two new song covers that are solos!

39:06.023 --> 39:09.366
As you know, back in October we released "Cute na Kanojo" but this time,

39:11.067 --> 39:11.327
FUWAMOCO!

39:27.931 --> 39:29.253
This is Fuwawa.

39:29.273 --> 39:31.916
This is Mococo.

39:32.356 --> 39:34.519
Please check it out!

39:34.559 --> 39:36.441
BAU BAU!

39:36.902 --> 39:40.285
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today.

39:40.566 --> 39:42.568
The very first day of the broadcast.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.990
BAU BAU!

39:46.010 --> 39:54.458
