05:11.060 --> 05:13.590
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:14.090 --> 05:17.625
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.645 --> 05:20.528
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:21.528 --> 05:24.551
BAU BAU!

05:25.211 --> 05:28.414
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:28.694 --> 05:31.076
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:31.136 --> 05:33.158
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:33.198 --> 05:34.319
BAU BAU!

05:37.995 --> 05:40.336
BAU BAU-chan, you're singing.

05:44.139 --> 05:45.720
BAU BAU!

05:45.740 --> 05:47.081
Ruffians!

05:48.181 --> 05:53.444
Today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:53.604 --> 05:55.225
BAU BAU!

05:55.546 --> 06:00.569
Thank you for waking up early and for joining us today for our 72nd episode!

06:00.629 --> 06:01.329
BAU BAU!

06:05.385 --> 06:08.613
I get it why Moco-chan always says things wrong.

06:08.633 --> 06:11.240
70 seconds doesn't sound right.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.844
That's too big of a number, no?

06:14.013 --> 06:14.553
I agree.

06:14.573 --> 06:20.396
Thank you for being here with us this morning, Ruffians!

06:20.416 --> 06:24.859
And for Ruffians who maybe, you're waking up for the first time!

06:25.339 --> 06:28.621
And joining us, uh, waking up for the first time!

06:28.941 --> 06:30.882
To join us for FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:31.442 --> 06:34.604
Today is the first morning!

06:36.305 --> 06:37.225
Not like that.

06:37.706 --> 06:38.546
Not like that.

06:38.726 --> 06:39.847
Happy birthday!

06:42.544 --> 06:43.265
BAU!

06:43.285 --> 06:50.092
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:50.572 --> 06:51.793
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:52.114 --> 06:56.198
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:57.058 --> 07:02.879
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:03.339 --> 07:08.660
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

07:08.941 --> 07:13.401
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:13.822 --> 07:16.962
BAU BAU!

07:17.022 --> 07:19.523
Now ruffians, you didn't know, but...

07:20.783 --> 07:21.804
Happy birthday!

07:22.404 --> 07:23.385
It's your first morning.

07:23.805 --> 07:32.710
Or the alternative is that maybe there's some vampiric ruffians out there and this is the first morning they're spending with us.

07:32.730 --> 07:33.911
Huh?

07:34.251 --> 07:40.515
Like vampires, they don't live... Vampires don't live in the morning time, Moco-chan.

07:40.535 --> 07:46.899
That's weird.

07:48.439 --> 07:50.120
I don't think we have any vampire ruffians.

07:50.140 --> 07:50.501
I don't either.

07:50.521 --> 07:50.821
I don't either.

07:50.841 --> 07:51.161
I don't either.

07:51.181 --> 07:51.462
I don't either.

07:51.482 --> 07:51.842
I don't either.

07:51.862 --> 07:52.162
I don't either.

07:52.442 --> 07:52.843
I don't either.

07:52.863 --> 07:53.363
I don't either.

07:53.383 --> 07:53.863
I don't either.

07:53.883 --> 07:54.464
I don't either.

07:54.484 --> 07:54.804
I don't either.

07:54.824 --> 07:55.525
I don't either.

07:55.545 --> 07:55.825
I don't either.

07:55.845 --> 07:56.946
I don't either.

07:56.966 --> 07:57.346
I don't either.

07:57.366 --> 07:58.427
I don't either.

07:58.447 --> 07:59.348
I don't either.

08:00.369 --> 08:00.869
I don't either.

08:00.889 --> 08:01.209
I don't either.

08:01.229 --> 08:01.570
I don't either.

08:01.590 --> 08:02.070
I don't either.

08:02.090 --> 08:02.550
I don't either.

08:02.590 --> 08:03.671
I don't either.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.112
I don't either.

08:04.132 --> 08:05.513
I don't either.

08:05.533 --> 08:05.873
I don't either.

08:05.893 --> 08:06.173
I don't either.

08:06.193 --> 08:07.735
I don't either.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.095
I don't either.

08:08.175 --> 08:08.715
I don't either.

08:08.735 --> 08:09.556
I don't either.

08:09.576 --> 08:09.876
I don't either.

08:09.896 --> 08:10.237
I don't either.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.518
I don't either.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.279
I don't either.

08:13.319 --> 08:14.000
I don't either.

08:14.020 --> 08:14.400
I don't either.

08:14.440 --> 08:14.880
I don't either.

08:14.940 --> 08:15.321
I don't either.

08:15.341 --> 08:16.161
I don't either.

08:16.181 --> 08:16.522
I don't either.

08:16.542 --> 08:16.842
I don't either.

08:16.862 --> 08:16.982
I don

08:19.184 --> 08:20.905
Pero Sighting!

08:20.925 --> 08:21.105
De-den!

08:45.329 --> 08:46.409
Oh!

08:47.810 --> 08:54.991
Did, uh... Did something happen when you were downloading some DLC for The Sims?

08:58.192 --> 09:00.772
Are you sure this is what you wanted?

09:02.413 --> 09:07.154
It looks kinda cool, but... Yeah, there's a lot of cool Sims stuff, right?

09:07.374 --> 09:10.634
Pero looks... pretty angry here, huh?

09:13.959 --> 09:17.080
You didn't do something that maybe warranted this.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.400
Right?

09:19.940 --> 09:20.520
Ha!

09:22.661 --> 09:27.022
Well, but, you know, Sims can be really fun, you know.

09:27.362 --> 09:32.023
You can be really creative, but it's kinda good just as it is too, right?

09:32.563 --> 09:36.264
You know, maybe that's why Pero's upset, you know.

09:37.205 --> 09:41.086
He maybe just wants you to enjoy the base game just as it is, you know?

09:41.126 --> 09:44.247
Like rice without toppings, you know?

09:44.267 --> 09:54.609
You know the rice is delicious, but if you put a bunch of things on top, then you might miss out on the complicated flavors that the rice has to offer.

09:54.629 --> 09:57.529
Yeah, complicated flavors of the rice.

09:58.150 --> 09:58.690
Get it?

09:59.290 --> 10:00.210
You get it right.

10:00.988 --> 10:04.272
I know recently Kiara-senpai and Nerissa, they play The Sims.

10:04.713 --> 10:06.395
And I look pretty fine, huh?

10:06.515 --> 10:07.076
It did.

10:07.396 --> 10:08.538
Huh.

10:08.998 --> 10:11.922
Is that why Awaken learns to play The Sims on you, maybe?

10:14.966 --> 10:16.747
I kind of felt something a bit too low.

10:17.968 --> 10:18.468
Not allowed.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.210
BAU BAU!

10:21.290 --> 10:25.853
Well, I guess good luck trying to fix things now, huh?

10:25.973 --> 10:26.314
Good luck!

10:27.574 --> 10:29.236
BAU BAU!

10:29.796 --> 10:33.659
That would be really scary to have on your computer all the time.

10:33.679 --> 10:36.841
You just wake it up and Pero's there!

10:37.521 --> 10:38.682
But it's trapped, right?

10:38.842 --> 10:40.303
Pero's always moving, right?

10:40.443 --> 10:43.265
So... Maybe he's trapped, but temporarily.

10:43.545 --> 10:44.746
Temporarily, huh?

10:45.486 --> 10:50.788
Well, on the topic of temporary... Ruffians!

10:51.328 --> 10:59.791
For a while there, we really weren't sure about this one.

11:02.191 --> 11:08.934
But... It looks like finally... FUWAMOCO!

11:09.554 --> 11:13.435
We're able to log into the EMPOWER server!

11:14.438 --> 11:16.580
BAU BAU!

11:16.700 --> 11:20.483
You know, we had so much fun playing with Advent last week.

11:20.503 --> 11:23.026
And we really wanted to play it again.

11:23.046 --> 11:28.570
But you know, it seems like there's a number of server issues and we just couldn't log in.

11:28.610 --> 11:29.271
We couldn't.

11:30.011 --> 11:37.238
Yeah, but you know, it can't really be helped because it's just such an explosively popular game right now.

11:37.258 --> 11:38.239
It makes sense.

11:38.679 --> 11:39.580
It happens.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.941
But, uh, well we mentioned it earlier, right?

11:43.062 --> 11:44.922
But... Now!

11:45.163 --> 11:46.803
Officially!

11:46.863 --> 11:49.825
We will be playing Power World on Thursday!

11:50.085 --> 11:50.965
On Thursday.

11:51.446 --> 11:51.686
Yeah.

11:51.966 --> 11:54.087
So... Sorry, Bread and Fred.

11:54.607 --> 11:55.608
BAU BAU.

11:55.908 --> 12:00.810
We couldn't play Bread and Fred, but... We'll see you again sometime soon.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.491
It'll happen in the future.

12:02.831 --> 12:04.472
Bread and Fred will be there.

12:04.672 --> 12:04.972
Yeah.

12:05.152 --> 12:05.853
For Power World.

12:06.433 --> 12:06.913
Power World.

12:07.414 --> 12:07.874
Power World.

12:09.113 --> 12:15.816
We hope that we can catch a lot of the cute pals and figure out some of the main mysteries, you know, of the game.

12:17.357 --> 12:22.220
Maybe we can play with some of our senpai too!

12:22.240 --> 12:27.282
There's a lot we still have to learn, but I'm looking forward to it!

12:27.322 --> 12:29.944
Now we don't have to be envious and go to Mana-chan.

12:30.364 --> 12:32.625
Mana-chan, I want to play POWER.

12:34.861 --> 12:36.202
Can we play Power Up?

12:36.222 --> 12:38.022
I wanna play Power Up.

12:38.182 --> 12:39.423
Use the puppy dog eyes.

12:39.823 --> 12:41.584
Power Up.

12:41.624 --> 12:42.104
Please.

12:42.124 --> 12:43.064
Right!

12:43.965 --> 12:48.667
We're looking forward to it on Thursday!

12:48.767 --> 12:52.008
BAU BAU!

12:52.028 --> 12:53.429
BAU BAU!

12:54.569 --> 12:56.570
Exciting, right, Ruffians?

12:57.490 --> 13:01.732
Well, you know we're talking about all the mysteries of our world, but...

13:02.955 --> 13:06.119
There's been some other mysteries we've been dealing with, huh?

13:06.139 --> 13:07.621
There has been.

13:07.801 --> 13:18.375
Well, Ruffians, do you remember that one FUWAMOCO Morning where our audio was suddenly very different from how it was beforehand?

13:18.395 --> 13:18.936
Do you?

13:22.739 --> 13:23.419
Yeah.

13:23.819 --> 13:26.040
It was really surprising for us.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.101
It was!

13:27.121 --> 13:28.041
Yeah.

13:28.661 --> 13:38.325
Ever since then, you know, we've been having some weird audio issues where everything is rather subdued in volume compared to our older streams.

13:38.365 --> 13:39.666
Yeah.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.647
Really, really, really, we absolutely didn't touch anything.

13:43.667 --> 13:43.707
No!

13:44.168 --> 13:47.389
But something somewhere must have gone funny.

13:48.989 --> 13:49.230
Yeah.

13:49.910 --> 13:50.150
But,

13:51.266 --> 13:52.006
Finally!

13:52.086 --> 13:52.907
Finally!

13:54.127 --> 13:59.129
It seems like things might be a little better now.

13:59.149 --> 14:00.130
Yeah.

14:00.470 --> 14:01.570
What do you think, Ruffians?

14:01.650 --> 14:02.030
Huh?

14:02.891 --> 14:03.151
Huh?

14:03.591 --> 14:07.232
Is it a little bit more like what it used to be closer to debut?

14:07.432 --> 14:08.373
BAU BAU.

14:08.693 --> 14:09.553
BAU BAU!

14:09.613 --> 14:10.634
BAU BAU!

14:11.174 --> 14:11.594
Yeah.

14:11.694 --> 14:14.995
We tried really hard to figure out the mystery causing the issue.

14:15.116 --> 14:15.576
Yeah.

14:15.756 --> 14:18.397
But we're still not sure what happened.

14:19.605 --> 14:21.207
But you know, as long as it's better!

14:21.227 --> 14:22.369
Right!

14:22.449 --> 14:23.370
It sounds the same!

14:23.390 --> 14:27.275
The same as... Older streams.

14:29.678 --> 14:30.479
BAU!

14:30.840 --> 14:31.441
You know...

14:32.296 --> 14:35.659
That is two of us, and you know, we've talked about that.

14:35.699 --> 14:40.522
Because of that, things are really different for us compared to our senpai.

14:41.023 --> 14:44.946
And, well, that can be really inconvenient sometimes.

14:45.366 --> 14:47.948
You know, there's no one we can go to for help.

14:48.348 --> 14:49.769
No Mani-chan.

14:50.149 --> 14:50.530
Yeah.

14:51.226 --> 14:51.947
BAU BAU.

14:52.527 --> 14:57.131
But, you know, so because of that, you know, we just have to do our best.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.173
We gotta do our absolute best.

14:59.774 --> 15:08.601
And you know, part of that, a big part of that is definitely try not to play around with things unnecessarily when they're working.

15:09.282 --> 15:09.602
Yeah.

15:10.003 --> 15:10.243
Yeah.

15:10.643 --> 15:10.883
Yeah.

15:11.384 --> 15:14.406
The whole thing has been a bit of an ordeal.

15:14.446 --> 15:14.687
Yeah.

15:19.518 --> 15:21.940
Let us know if you think it's better, okay, ruffians?

15:22.180 --> 15:23.381
We didn't do anything.

15:24.081 --> 15:25.402
We didn't do anything.

15:25.462 --> 15:26.183
It's fixed, though.

15:26.763 --> 15:28.304
It is fixed.

15:28.404 --> 15:28.784
Right.

15:30.525 --> 15:36.069
Well, we're always looking to improve, so... BAU BAU!

15:37.430 --> 15:39.832
It is better.

15:40.392 --> 15:41.593
It's probably good.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.775
Everyone has different ears, you know.

15:45.115 --> 15:45.675
Right?

15:46.236 --> 15:46.376
But...

15:47.261 --> 15:53.746
Well, we're gonna do our best to find something that works for as many ruffians as possible.

15:53.827 --> 15:54.747
It might break again.

15:54.987 --> 15:55.848
It might break again.

15:55.868 --> 15:57.670
It's a mystery, we don't know why.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.052
It's still a mystery!

16:00.572 --> 16:03.675
But ruffians will actually...

16:08.240 --> 16:10.682
Something a bit surprising yesterday.

16:10.702 --> 16:19.869
You know, we had a members stream where we tidied up our download folder and we chatted about a bunch of different things.

16:20.370 --> 16:33.080
And, well, this time we got a little passionate about, well... Maybe something we shouldn't have.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.601
Something...

16:36.274 --> 16:38.956
Well, our opinions on food.

16:39.977 --> 16:47.143
Somehow, we ended up talking about what is the most delicious part of the leaf of lettuce.

16:47.844 --> 16:48.625
Quite in-depth.

16:48.685 --> 16:49.105
In-depth!

16:49.646 --> 16:50.146
Yum!

16:50.226 --> 16:50.626
I know.

16:50.646 --> 16:53.329
We wanted to apologize.

16:55.568 --> 16:58.530
You know, Zatsudan... Just chatting and whatnot.

16:58.590 --> 17:03.314
Yeah, it's definitely something you know when you talk about a lot of different things.

17:03.935 --> 17:12.582
But, talking about things like this... I don't know if that's acceptable, ruffians.

17:13.623 --> 17:17.647
So, we wanted to say that we're sorry.

17:18.649 --> 17:20.690
We're sorry for talking about lettuce.

17:20.770 --> 17:21.151
Yeah.

17:21.731 --> 17:26.514
We'll make sure that we're talking about more wordy topics in the future.

17:26.534 --> 17:33.679
And not about how the deep green of the chlorophyll tastes delicious like the taste of fresh nature.

17:33.759 --> 17:34.039
Yeah.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.220
Yeah.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.100
Not that stuff.

17:36.281 --> 17:36.661
No.

17:37.101 --> 17:44.146
And we'll also make sure not to hate on nice breakfast foods like cereal or pancakes either.

17:44.526 --> 17:45.467
Right, Moco-chan?

17:50.234 --> 17:51.214
I'll do my best.

17:52.495 --> 17:57.338
You know, I definitely don't feel passionate when it comes to breakfast foods, okay?

17:59.299 --> 18:05.962
That means you do though, right?

18:06.023 --> 18:08.244
BAU BAU!

18:09.144 --> 18:09.965
Not natto.

18:10.525 --> 18:11.806
Ah, not natto.

18:11.866 --> 18:12.066
No.

18:13.346 --> 18:14.927
BAU BAU!

18:14.947 --> 18:17.769
This is my apology.

18:18.820 --> 18:22.764
We just apologized!

18:33.291 --> 18:34.952
Apology accepted!

18:35.112 --> 18:39.493
Thank you!

18:39.613 --> 18:40.493
Ruffians!

18:41.334 --> 18:45.655
Okay, this is silly, but we have something to talk about.

18:45.675 --> 18:45.755
Okay?

18:47.756 --> 18:50.517
Sometimes, in the hololive reddit,

18:51.497 --> 18:54.659
Do you have any clue what it could be, ruffians?

19:12.912 --> 19:12.952
Hi.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.073
Oh no, Scarlet.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.893
I'm asking you a question.

19:16.933 --> 19:17.773
You stay put.

19:19.334 --> 19:21.594
You are being interrogated right now.

19:21.674 --> 19:22.755
You stay here.

19:22.935 --> 19:23.455
Hi.

19:26.055 --> 19:28.136
I'm not seeing any answers.

19:28.476 --> 19:28.736
Hi.

19:30.677 --> 19:34.238
Well, I'll just have to tell you then, hi.

19:34.338 --> 19:34.578
Wow.

19:41.530 --> 19:52.092
It seems like some ruffians think that we have some kind of method or complicated system behind the times when we accidentally think what we say.

19:53.513 --> 19:54.453
Except, no.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.634
They don't think it's an accident thing.

19:58.294 --> 20:01.714
They think that it's coordinated, okay?

20:03.255 --> 20:08.556
I, ruffians, you do realize that

20:09.813 --> 20:11.995
It's embarrassing for us.

20:12.995 --> 20:16.117
We honestly don't try to say things at the same time.

20:16.137 --> 20:23.443
We definitely don't plan for it or have a system or use things like hand signals or anything like that to do that.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.064
That's so silly!

20:25.184 --> 20:26.705
Think about what you're saying!

20:26.725 --> 20:27.485
Right!

20:28.706 --> 20:29.287
Right!

20:30.107 --> 20:34.631
Yeah, I know, you know, it might be hard because you don't have a twin.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.251
I'm sorry.

20:35.271 --> 20:37.052
Yeah, I'm sorry to break it to you.

20:37.072 --> 20:38.673
It just, it just happens.

20:38.994 --> 20:39.654
You know?

20:40.495 --> 20:45.939
It's actually harder for us to sync up if we're trying to count down to sync at the same time.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.480
Like, okay Moco-chan.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.561
Three, two, one.

20:49.762 --> 20:53.885
We are FUWAMOCO!

20:54.025 --> 20:56.306
See, it's better like... We are FUWAMOCO!

21:00.839 --> 21:05.821
We are FUWAMOCO!

21:05.861 --> 21:07.801
Also doesn't help that we're laughing, huh?

21:08.061 --> 21:09.622
Ah, laughing doesn't help, huh?

21:09.882 --> 21:11.062
But you see!

21:11.723 --> 21:12.483
Yeah.

21:12.603 --> 21:17.124
You know, I think for us, we're just used to how each other breathes.

21:17.325 --> 21:18.785
And then from there it's easy.

21:18.805 --> 21:21.026
Does that make sense?

21:21.686 --> 21:22.446
Right.

21:22.586 --> 21:26.107
Maybe it's just that our breathing and our speech patterns are similar?

21:26.468 --> 21:29.649
Point proven.

21:30.009 --> 21:30.289
Yeah.

21:30.930 --> 21:32.091
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

21:32.111 --> 21:32.692
BAU BAU!

21:44.991 --> 21:48.393
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

22:06.001 --> 22:09.884
We know how each other's brains work, and we know what will come up next.

22:10.805 --> 22:11.525
All right.

22:11.966 --> 22:15.429
Nerissa, you want to sync up with FUWAMOCO?

22:15.649 --> 22:17.050
Have we known already?

22:18.891 --> 22:19.752
I made a sync up.

22:20.853 --> 22:21.113
Huh?

22:22.114 --> 22:22.494
I did.

22:23.035 --> 22:23.455
Yeah.

22:24.236 --> 22:29.200
But I did a video editing.

22:30.721 --> 22:30.881
Oh.

22:30.901 --> 22:31.822
You will be the triplet!

22:33.425 --> 22:43.058
Well, Ruffians, you know, I know it's weird and maybe it's hard to understand, so we're sorry, okay?

22:43.398 --> 22:47.844
But you know, this is just what being a twin is about.

22:48.185 --> 22:49.146
It's a part of it.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.367
At least for us.

22:51.325 --> 22:51.845
Got it!

22:51.865 --> 22:56.949
Yeah, we definitely don't plan to say things like a whole sentence together.

22:56.969 --> 23:03.173
I think one time we synced up talking about parts of an anison sandwich.

23:04.654 --> 23:07.716
That is not something we planned to do!

23:08.276 --> 23:09.617
You didn't really talk about it.

23:10.057 --> 23:13.980
One side being one part of an anison sandwich.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.401
It doesn't happen.

23:15.441 --> 23:16.442
Okay?

23:17.862 --> 23:18.203
It's just...

23:19.321 --> 23:20.461
Something, okay?

23:22.002 --> 23:24.403
Maybe it's just FUWAMOCO being FUWAMOCO.

23:24.563 --> 23:24.843
Sorry!

23:25.843 --> 23:30.825
BAU BAU!

23:31.245 --> 23:31.945
BAU!

23:32.546 --> 23:33.306
Is it silly?

23:33.566 --> 23:36.007
It's just FUWAMOCO.

23:36.427 --> 23:38.048
Ruffians!

23:38.508 --> 23:42.349
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've been working pretty hard this week.

23:42.969 --> 23:46.331
And I think that you've been working even harder too.

23:48.069 --> 23:54.011
You know, maybe it's been a little rough, so... Moco-chan!

23:54.351 --> 23:59.453
Do you have anything that you could say to make it a little less rough for the ruffians?

24:02.054 --> 24:02.394
Well...

24:07.586 --> 24:08.907
Ruffians!

24:09.767 --> 24:11.208
It's today!

24:11.748 --> 24:21.094
Today is the day again where it's time to listen up because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

24:21.874 --> 24:24.075
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.416
Mococo!

24:27.957 --> 24:29.158
Ruffians!

24:30.379 --> 24:30.919
Hi there.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.560
Good morning!

24:38.188 --> 24:39.469
How are you feeling today?

24:42.710 --> 24:43.130
Uh-uh.

24:43.870 --> 24:44.851
A bit tired.

24:44.871 --> 24:47.151
Good morning.

24:49.212 --> 24:49.873
Sleepy?

24:51.033 --> 24:52.534
Well, you know.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.594
That makes sense.

24:55.355 --> 24:59.356
You know, you keep on working so hard every day!

24:59.376 --> 25:05.859
I think sometimes it's hard to see yourself improving and growing little by little.

25:06.874 --> 25:10.755
But if you focus, you know, it's there!

25:11.515 --> 25:12.275
I know it is!

25:13.395 --> 25:18.056
You're moving forward each and every day thanks to the effort of your own hard work.

25:19.216 --> 25:26.938
And even though not many people might recognize your efforts, you know that in your heart, you're doing it.

25:27.718 --> 25:29.218
And I do too, okay?

25:29.959 --> 25:31.759
So just continue to do your best,

25:34.929 --> 25:38.452
Just believe in your process, and I'm sure it'll all work out, okay?

25:39.794 --> 25:45.359
And you know, if one door does close, another door will open.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.265
Believe in yourself and all your strengths, because you're amazing!

25:51.905 --> 25:52.586
I know you are.

25:52.606 --> 25:54.308
Fuwawa knows you are.

25:54.328 --> 25:58.312
And even Pero, he knows too.

25:59.989 --> 26:01.412
Everything is gonna be okay.

26:02.013 --> 26:03.896
Even if it's a bit rough right now, okay?

26:04.657 --> 26:05.258
You can do it.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.102
Ganbatte de!

26:07.162 --> 26:08.745
BAU BAU!

26:14.134 --> 26:15.574
You can do it, Moco!

26:15.614 --> 26:17.015
It's okay!

26:17.395 --> 26:19.436
BAU BAU!

26:20.176 --> 26:24.738
Well, let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan.

26:25.398 --> 26:29.440
Today's Doggie of the Day is... BAU BAU!

26:29.700 --> 26:30.180
Morning!

26:32.621 --> 26:33.542
Birdie!

26:33.702 --> 26:36.524
Kinda sounds like body.

26:36.564 --> 26:37.885
Birdie's my body.

26:39.486 --> 26:42.708
Look at those ears too!

26:43.088 --> 26:46.450
The ears are big like mine.

26:46.910 --> 26:48.912
What is Birdie looking at though?

26:49.192 --> 26:51.673
See, that's a deep mystery.

26:52.814 --> 26:53.475
Ruffians!

26:53.555 --> 26:55.176
Mysterious Deep Eyes.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.918
Do you have any ideas what birdie's looking at?

26:58.058 --> 26:59.299
She's looking at a birdie.

26:59.319 --> 27:00.620
At a birdie?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.020
No.

27:01.261 --> 27:01.441
Huh?

27:01.961 --> 27:03.462
A demon of sound birdie?

27:03.502 --> 27:04.183
Or... Whoa.

27:05.063 --> 27:06.084
G-g-ghost!

27:06.765 --> 27:07.365
Ghost!

27:07.425 --> 27:07.866
Ghost!

27:08.326 --> 27:09.387
A-a train?

27:10.287 --> 27:11.348
I don't know.

27:11.648 --> 27:12.209
Hello.

27:12.469 --> 27:13.710
Looking at FUWAMOCO!

27:13.770 --> 27:16.112
With those eyes.

27:16.872 --> 27:17.193
Hi.

27:21.154 --> 27:22.674
A bug?

27:23.234 --> 27:26.095
Maybe like a stink bug?

27:28.155 --> 27:30.336
I don't like that.

27:31.216 --> 27:32.556
That one makes sense.

27:33.017 --> 27:36.297
Wow, Moco-chan, how does birdie BAU BAU?

27:36.317 --> 27:38.938
I think birdie goes...

27:40.447 --> 27:41.247
BAU BAU!

27:41.587 --> 27:42.248
BAU BAU!

27:42.308 --> 27:43.328
BAU BAU!

27:43.488 --> 27:44.448
BAU BAU!

27:44.588 --> 27:45.489

27:45.829 --> 27:46.249

27:46.269 --> 27:46.589

27:46.689 --> 27:47.810
BAU BAU!

27:47.830 --> 27:48.390
BAU BAU!

27:48.430 --> 27:48.790
BAU BAU!

27:48.850 --> 27:49.250
BAU BAU!

27:49.290 --> 27:49.630
BAU BAU!

27:49.690 --> 27:50.010
BAU BAU!

27:50.070 --> 27:50.631
BAU BAU!

27:50.671 --> 27:50.951
BAU BAU!

27:50.991 --> 27:51.371
BAU BAU!

27:51.431 --> 27:53.131

27:53.171 --> 27:53.732
BAU BAU!

27:54.052 --> 27:54.352

27:54.372 --> 27:54.932

27:55.032 --> 27:55.352

Well, you know, Birdie is an absolute cutie.

28:15.481 --> 28:19.324
Also, maybe has a bit of a lazy side sometimes.

28:19.424 --> 28:20.144
That's okay.

28:20.484 --> 28:25.208
Yeah, but that's okay because Birdie just wants to snuggle up with you.

28:25.508 --> 28:27.729
It's okay to be lazy if you're gonna snuggle.

28:27.850 --> 28:28.090
Yeah.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.495
Is it awkward?

28:42.752 --> 28:45.033
It's only awkward if you wanted to be ruffians.

28:47.013 --> 28:48.734
Well, it's okay.

28:49.054 --> 28:51.115
Because birdie is cute.

28:51.235 --> 28:51.595
Yeah.

28:52.035 --> 28:52.375
Yeah.

28:53.075 --> 28:53.695
It's okay.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.575
It's forgiven.

28:54.976 --> 28:56.236
Because birdie is cute.

BAU BAU!

29:01.957 --> 29:03.718
What do you mean ha?

29:03.818 --> 29:04.338
What?

29:04.438 --> 29:05.318
It makes sense.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.079
The logic is there.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.749
Thank you, birdie.

29:23.226 --> 29:24.467
We learned a lot today.

BAU BAU!

29:26.649 --> 29:27.470
BAU BAU!

29:27.610 --> 29:32.254
Well, next we have... Today I went on a walk!

29:32.534 --> 29:35.757
And we have... De-den!

29:35.777 --> 29:40.240
Oh my gosh!

29:40.881 --> 29:43.803
That's both beautiful and super cold!

29:43.903 --> 29:48.027
I can feel the cold air rushing through my body just looking at this!

29:49.288 --> 29:49.889
That's the sound.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.473
But the trees look so pretty too!

29:56.953 --> 30:01.236
We hope you had a wonderful walk and or ski!

30:02.097 --> 30:07.620
Is this also another time where it's okay to be lazy if we're going to cuddle?

30:07.640 --> 30:08.901
Because it's chilly!

30:08.921 --> 30:14.485
Oh, well, you should probably find somewhere like a lodge or something with a

30:16.337 --> 30:18.579
What are you imagining now, huh?

30:19.060 --> 30:22.083
Moco-chan, you suggested we snuggle in the snow.

30:22.103 --> 30:26.127
I was just thinking.

30:27.868 --> 30:31.812
Well, thank you for sharing your view with us too!

30:31.832 --> 30:32.453
BAU BAU!

30:34.094 --> 30:37.337
I don't know snuggling in the snow is the safest idea.

30:37.498 --> 30:38.378
A snow cave.

30:41.352 --> 30:47.414
Well, our question of the day we have... De-den!

30:47.914 --> 30:52.816
During the reveal, Fuwawa let us know that the New Year outfits have paw beans.

30:52.856 --> 30:54.416
We do, we have paw beans!

30:54.456 --> 31:03.219
Yeah, it feels nice squishing cats' or dogs' beans, so I wanted to ask, is it okay to touch FUWAMOCO's paw beans?

31:03.239 --> 31:07.940
Touch our beans.

31:13.894 --> 31:15.315
Only when we say it's okay.

31:15.356 --> 31:15.896
Okay.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.177
Permission.

31:18.979 --> 31:24.284
But actually, you know, it would be really nice to get a hand massage.

31:24.905 --> 31:25.605
Right?

31:26.086 --> 31:28.769
Sometimes you see them on TV, right?

31:28.869 --> 31:30.430
It's so fancy and all!

31:30.530 --> 31:32.112
A little aggressive, no?

31:32.152 --> 31:32.492
Why?

31:34.353 --> 31:41.321
Take your heart and go... No, resting the paw is softening the bean.

31:41.401 --> 31:44.304
It sounds good right now, too hot.

31:44.665 --> 31:44.985
But!

31:45.686 --> 31:46.847
Only when we say so.

Well, we don't have a stream on our channel tonight, but we'll be seeing you over on the official Hololive English YouTube channel with some very important information.

32:56.684 --> 33:02.371
Upcoming Hololive Expo and Fifth Fest Capture the Moment!

33:02.792 --> 33:04.454
Are you excited, Ruffians?

33:05.194 --> 33:07.317
I'm so excited!

33:07.377 --> 33:12.143
But there will be some more details as well as some cool news revealed!

33:12.744 --> 33:15.687
And it will all be in English, so please join us for it, okay?

33:16.568 --> 33:20.269
It'll be a lot of fun together with Ina-senpai and Rin-senpai!

I'm excited!

33:21.309 --> 33:24.610
Don't forget, okay?

33:24.650 --> 33:27.711

Let's take a little peek here.

33:36.232 --> 33:38.753
Well, like we mentioned, bread and bread.

33:39.153 --> 33:41.935
Has been bumped by power.

33:41.995 --> 33:47.340
So on Thursday we'll be exploring the EN server for the very first time.

33:47.420 --> 33:54.005
And also be aware that inside the back rooms in Advent on Friday is now at 4pm PT.

33:54.325 --> 33:58.208
So it is two hours earlier than usual.

33:58.729 --> 34:00.090
Don't be surprised, okay?

34:00.290 --> 34:03.793
And I'm sitting on the middle chair so it's also two hours earlier than usual.

34:04.153 --> 34:06.074
It's a bit earlier this week, okay?

34:07.534 --> 34:09.475
Just remember, gotta be early.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.516
Gotta be early, gotta be early, okay?

34:13.796 --> 34:16.237
We'll make sure to be early and brief.
