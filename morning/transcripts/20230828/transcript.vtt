00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.310
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:08.890
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:17.315
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.957
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:20.197 --> 00:05:22.979
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:24.940
BAU BAU!

00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:28.663
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:31.445
Thank you for joining us for our 12th episode!

00:05:34.827 --> 00:05:36.527
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.268
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:39.128
Thank you!

00:05:39.348 --> 00:05:49.571
But because there might be some new Ruffians joining us for the first time today, to explain FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:50.431
A.K.A.

00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.211
FUWAMOCO.

00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:55.152
And it's hosted by us, by us, FUWAMOCO.

00:05:55.212 --> 00:05:56.253
In case you didn't know!

00:05:57.773 --> 00:06:02.175
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start off your day on the right paw.

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:08.038
Please make sure you tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.558
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.920
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.921
BAU BAU!

00:06:17.048 --> 00:06:18.129
Ruffians, BAU BAU!

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.990
BAU BAU!

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:26.639
Now, first, we have something a bit important to talk about, okay?

00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:29.643
Listen closely, okay?

00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:33.027
We have an apology.

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:38.056
Very important apology.

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:49.064
We want to apologize to any Ruffians who are deeply disturbed, even maybe traumatized, by our previous episode of FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:51.486
It aired last week.

00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:54.489
Do you remember it?

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.834
Oh, you do?

00:06:57.995 --> 00:07:07.008
Unfortunately, there was an on-air incident where instead of us being here to run the show, our pet petal took over.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.912
Yeah, it was a pretty serious on-air incident.

00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:12.992
We're sorry.

00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:15.113
We're sorry, Ruffians.

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:21.116
If you felt uncomfortable, or bad, or even worse, if he hurt your smile.

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:22.636
He wasn't rude, right?

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.657
Are you okay, Ruffians?

00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:27.759
You're deeply traumatized!

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.099
He didn't scare you, right?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.801
He said he would beat you up!

00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.042
He was adorable.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.283
Those are very different messages just now.

00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:39.906
Just a bit conflicting.

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.730
A little bit.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.872
A little bit.

00:07:43.932 --> 00:07:44.873
Anything scary?

00:07:44.913 --> 00:07:46.095
Did he say anything scary?

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:47.457
Your smile was damaged!

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.601
No... No...

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.091
We're really, really sorry.

00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:59.416
We'll make sure that we teach him some new tricks once we get our paws on him, okay?

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:00.297
Yeah.

00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:01.798
He'll get back here eventually.

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:02.379
Eventually.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:03.640
We'll find him, right?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.401
Yeah.

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:07.383
But... Yeah, we're not really sure what's going on.

00:08:07.744 --> 00:08:09.625
We thought he was still in the background.

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:09.946
Right!

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:11.287
We weren't looking.

00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:15.070
Yeah, we weren't able to rescue him, but... Maybe not.

00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:17.513
Yeah...

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.050
We're sorry, Ruffians.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.411
Please, please, our sincerest apologies.

00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:27.992
We won't sleep in again, okay?

00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:28.372
Yeah.

00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:30.272
It's so weird.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.233
Onto our normal stuff.

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:40.074
Actually, Moco-chan, it seems like another Ruffian has seen Perroccino.

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:42.115
Where is he now?

00:08:42.998 --> 00:08:44.979
He just keeps on going.

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:45.640
What?

00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.222
I guess he's still not stuck in the back rooms.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:49.862
Maybe not.

00:08:49.882 --> 00:08:52.864
Well, this Ruffian reported seeing him at their workplace.

00:08:52.944 --> 00:08:53.324
I guess...

00:08:56.553 --> 00:09:01.015
Maybe Pero got bored of his day to day and decided to get some good life experience.

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.217
Maybe that's why he's not around recently.

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:04.557
He wants to branch out.

00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:06.318
Maybe, maybe.

00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:11.221
I definitely never knew he was forklift certified.

00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:16.664
Maybe he studied up and passed a test while he was stuck in the backgrounds or something.

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:17.924
Wow.

00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:18.625
That would be good.

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:18.985
I'd be happy.

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:24.187
I wonder how he... he... he pushes all the pedals and the wheels.

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.367
Let's not think too deeply about it.

00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:27.588
Yeah.

00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:31.249
But why did he learn... Why did he want to learn how to drive a forklift?

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:33.170
Why not get new skills?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.151
True.

00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:36.891
I mean, they're yellow.

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:40.693
It's kind of like a cart, but it makes beep beep beep sounds, right?

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.833
That's kind of fun.

00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:42.614
It's sort of fun.

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:43.474
Yeah, you know?

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:44.274
Pick up stuff.

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:45.795
Or maybe, you know... Drop stuff.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.117
Drop stuff.

00:09:48.357 --> 00:09:53.160
Maybe he did it to help this Ruffian out.

00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:58.805
Are there any other Ruffians that would like Pero to come help them out with his forklift?

00:09:58.965 --> 00:09:59.966
I think that sounds good.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.148
Do you need some forklift help, Ruffians?

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:05.750
Beep beep sounds yes.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.351
It's a big part of the job.

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.310
Yes!

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:11.651
Yes!

00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:12.092
Yes!

00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:13.013
Nah, you're good.

00:10:13.053 --> 00:10:13.574
You're good?

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:14.616
Okay.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:15.738
Can you do your work too?

00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:19.545
A little bit maybe, but... You probably do the work the best.

00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:28.054
That's a very interesting sighting today, right?

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:31.136
Please, Ruffians, let us know if you see him around again.

00:10:31.437 --> 00:10:33.538
Maybe he'll be at your workplace next?

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:34.759
Yeah, can you use him as a cushion?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.260
I think so.

00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:36.941
Maybe, yeah.

00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:39.363
Yeah, just wash him real good.

00:10:39.663 --> 00:10:43.927
If you do happen to see him, remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:45.348
Okay, okay.

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:57.734
You know, actually, you know, it is really strange that Pero would be driving a forklift, but maybe he was inspired by us, you know, with our new job to pick up new smiles.

00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:00.195
Now, Pero wanted to get a job too.

00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:01.396
Maybe.

00:11:01.756 --> 00:11:02.096
Maybe?

00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:06.859
But I don't think he's that... I want to assume the best.

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:07.679
Yeah, okay.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.901
Maybe he's changing a bit, huh?

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:11.901
Maybe.

00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:12.882
Maybe.

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:16.159
FUWAMOCO, are we forklift certified?

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:17.059
No.

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:18.559
I cannot drive a car.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:19.440
No.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.300
I think a forklift is included in that.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.321
I think the beep beep part is fun though.

00:11:24.341 --> 00:11:25.181
The beep beep, right?

00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.022
And the dropping stuff.

00:11:27.242 --> 00:11:27.762
That's cool.

00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:30.543
Thank you!

00:11:30.603 --> 00:11:31.943
BAU BAU!

00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:35.584
Well, we have some exciting news!

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:38.085
There's a lot of things that happened over this weekend.

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:41.446
First, Novi-san!

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:45.250
Holo Abyss, Demon of Sound.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.711
Arisa Ravenclaw.

00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:49.953
She released her third song cover!

00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:52.054
We heard it already!

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:57.918
This time, it's Magia from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.

00:11:58.378 --> 00:11:59.559
Amazing!

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:05.642
Ruffians, you know she's the Demon of Sound for a reason.

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:06.603
You heard it?

00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:07.563
It was really good, right?

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:07.884
Right!

00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:09.144
All the harmonies!

00:12:09.525 --> 00:12:11.106
And the visuals too!

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:14.380
If you haven't had a chance yet, go!

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:15.862
After FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:12:15.882 --> 00:12:17.184
Go check it out.

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:20.849
Do you have a favorite part, Ruffians?

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:27.651
I think, for me, my favorite part was the bridge leading into the final chorus.

00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:31.674
You know, everything like, picks up and gets so intense.

00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:33.836
I kinda got... I got goosebumps.

00:12:33.856 --> 00:12:36.298
It was a bit nostalgic too though, right?

00:12:48.097 --> 00:12:51.559
It's really the perfect song for New Year's.

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:54.700
Please go give a listen, okay Ruffians?

00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:56.221
After FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:12:56.421 --> 00:12:57.482
And what else do we have?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.105
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:09.746
BAU BAU!

00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:22.121
Did you see?

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:22.701
Did you see?

00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.522
We actually have some extra special photos here that you might have not seen yet.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:28.082
See?

00:13:28.102 --> 00:13:28.663
Look it!

00:13:29.383 --> 00:13:30.163
Oh, you got them!

00:13:30.283 --> 00:13:30.403
Oh!

00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:30.743
Oh!

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:31.083
Oh!

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:35.544
Well, you know... In case you needed a bit more convincing.

00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:35.744
Yeah.

00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:37.224
Here are the magnets too!

00:13:37.244 --> 00:13:38.865
We're really looking forward to them, you know.

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:40.225
They're such a good size.

00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:40.985
They're nice and thick.

00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:42.826
Nice and thick, you know.

00:13:42.926 --> 00:13:48.487
If you happen to accidentally hit them off the fridge, like sometimes I do, they won't break apart!

00:13:48.607 --> 00:13:48.767
Yeah!

00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:51.348
They look very strong.

00:13:51.628 --> 00:13:53.550
I have a bit of a habit of doing this.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.852
Yeah, the magnets before.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.533
And the acrylic stands here.

00:13:57.893 --> 00:14:00.275
And we have this stained glass kitchen.

00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:02.096
It's very appealing.

00:14:03.757 --> 00:14:04.658
Are there any Ruffians?

00:14:04.998 --> 00:14:06.600
Have you decided where you're gonna put it?

00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:11.823
It'd be nice outside in the summer, right?

00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:13.605
True, true.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:22.070
You know, it'd kind of be nice to get a bird feeder, plant some flowers, and then put this up near it.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.311
You know, I sort of feel like it'd be a good present to give your mom.

00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:28.333
To Mama Puppy?

00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:32.534
I'm sure Mama Puppy would like it too, but I'm sure Ruffian Mama.

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:35.015
Maybe we should order multiple copies?

00:14:39.618 --> 00:14:42.100
I guess Mother's Day is a bit far away, but you could save it for later.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.080
Start thinking now!

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:53.027
And of course, the debut merch wouldn't be complete without the acrylic stands too.

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:56.149
If you order Moco-chan's acrylic stand,

00:14:57.481 --> 00:15:00.824
It'd be nice if you could order my stand too.

00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:01.845
Right?

00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:03.326
You will, right?

00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:04.727
Right?

00:15:04.928 --> 00:15:05.748
It's a pair, right?

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:07.950
Moco-chan, you don't want to be separated?

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.813
No, not really.

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:14.716
Please!

00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:15.597
Why?

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:17.338
Important though.

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:18.720
This is the important part.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.721
The photos are very pretty, but...

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:28.198
The pre-order window ends in a week from today, so please be sure to order yours before it closes, okay?

00:15:28.298 --> 00:15:29.198
Yeah, okay!

00:15:29.238 --> 00:15:31.260
Debut merch only happens once.

00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:33.761
Now is the chance!

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:41.001
Also check out our starting voice packs too!

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:42.363
There's a lot of volume.

00:15:42.383 --> 00:15:43.544
A lot of volume?

00:15:43.624 --> 00:15:44.625
Volume, you know.

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:47.267
You think it's just like a morning voice being like, good morning.

00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:50.631
But it's actually much more than that.

00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:52.272
Please check it out!

00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:53.914
BAU BAU!

00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:54.555
Don't forget!

00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:57.598
Only one week left until you can't get them anymore.

00:15:58.564 --> 00:15:59.625
You already got them?

00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:00.986
Thank you!

00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:06.952
Actually, there's also something very exciting about this weekend.

00:16:07.392 --> 00:16:08.873
It was holo-summer.

00:16:08.893 --> 00:16:14.258
Yes, this past weekend was the grand finale of this year's holo-summer.

00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:17.781
Ruffians, you might have joined us for a much longer splash party.

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:18.522
Did you enjoy it?

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:27.826
Also, did you know that Advent week got to participate in Holo Summer in another way too?

00:16:28.327 --> 00:16:28.487
Yeah!

00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:29.467
Did you see them?

00:16:29.928 --> 00:16:30.668
Did you see?

00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:31.269
Ruffians!

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:33.430
Yes!

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.130
Yes!

00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:35.211
De-den!

00:16:36.732 --> 00:16:37.313
Yes!

00:16:37.773 --> 00:16:41.696
We participated in the Holo Summer Shorts Series!

00:16:42.156 --> 00:16:43.076
What did you think?

00:16:43.357 --> 00:16:44.257
Did you enjoy them?

00:16:44.457 --> 00:16:46.959
Did you like my cotton candy?

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.321
Did you like splashing?

00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:50.641
Splashing with Moco-chan!

00:16:54.483 --> 00:16:58.444
We had a lot of fun recording them, so we hope that you'll check them out.

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:01.805
You can find them right on our YouTube channel here too.

00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:03.646
Only after FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:17:03.786 --> 00:17:05.386
Only after, of course.

00:17:05.406 --> 00:17:11.988
They're short, you know, so... Why was the cotton candy crunchy?

00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:14.049
Because it's special.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:20.911
Did you know that when cotton candy, the best way to eat it is when you crush it down and sort of make it all...

00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:22.873
Like a sandwich.

00:17:22.913 --> 00:17:26.439
And then it's extra crunchy.

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:27.701
That's why it sounds crunchy.

00:17:29.704 --> 00:17:33.370
But I wanted to say though, especially maybe for the Ruffians that

00:17:34.562 --> 00:17:38.104
Visual Novels have a special place in our hearts.

00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:44.668
Definitely check it out, because there's a lot of Visual Novel vibes to them too.

00:17:44.948 --> 00:17:54.254
I think, you know, hopefully next year things might be a little different, but we're just really really happy to be given the opportunity to participate.

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:56.995
I didn't expect that, right Mococo?

00:17:57.315 --> 00:17:58.156
I'm happy.

00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:00.537
Ruffians, did you have a favorite part?

00:18:04.582 --> 00:18:08.165
At least for me, my favorite part was when I go, hey, hey, hey!

00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:10.206
You know?

00:18:10.687 --> 00:18:11.788
What about you, Moco-chan?

00:18:12.388 --> 00:18:15.010
Oh, I liked it when the water splashed before me.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.093
It was really nice and refreshing, you know?

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:19.993
Yeah.

00:18:20.174 --> 00:18:23.416
It felt like, yes, this is whole summer, right?

00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:24.657
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.259
FUWAMOCO Vision of When.

00:18:28.886 --> 00:18:29.226
One day.

00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:30.047
Hopefully.

00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:33.789
It's one of our goals!

00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:37.352
We can't synchronize saying that.

00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:41.314
But for now, maybe this will have to be the start of that.

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:45.777
Please take a peek at the Mocchi and Abyss!

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:46.458
Check it out!

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:46.958
Check it out!

00:18:46.998 --> 00:18:49.280
Check it out!

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.041
Awesome!

00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:52.082
In case you didn't know,

00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:56.002
Our membership!

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.022
They opened this weekend!

00:18:58.463 --> 00:19:11.348
So not only was it holo summer ground finale, but it was extra extra special because not only, you know, it was our 500k celebration, but our membership also opened!

00:19:11.388 --> 00:19:16.049
Thank you so so much for all your love, Ruffians.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.871
We're so happy to form the strong Doggy Pack all together now.

00:19:20.891 --> 00:19:22.692
Doggy Pack, Doggy Pack, alright?

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:26.636
And I think some Ruffians have been enjoying all the special emotes.

00:19:26.656 --> 00:19:27.517
Maybe just a bit.

00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:29.279
Maybe just a bit.

00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:30.840
I don't see lots of BAU BAUs.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.581
No, not at all.

00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:33.663
Thank you for the BAU BAUs!

00:19:34.484 --> 00:19:37.207
Yeah, our emotes were illustrated by Meru-pun-san.

00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:39.570
Meru-pun-san, arigatou!

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.050
So cute!

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.711
They're so, so cute.

00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:43.954
We almost died of cuteness when we first saw them.

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:50.539
Please continue to give us lots and lots, okay?

00:19:50.919 --> 00:20:01.786
We also hope that we can add even more emotes in the future, so let's build a more passionate, a more strong Doggy Pack, okay?

00:20:03.147 --> 00:20:12.253
We also have some fun plans coming up for the Doggy Pack very soon, so if you're thinking of joining, it might be a good time.

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:16.876
And be like, let's do this!

00:20:17.276 --> 00:20:20.878
That was the first thing you said before you said good morning or anything.

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:22.499
Get out of bed, Fuwawa.

00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:24.100
You're like, this, this, this.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:24.881
What do you think of this?

00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:26.802
I was kind of like, what are you talking about?

00:20:26.822 --> 00:20:29.683
I feel like that's a good time for ideas for me.

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:30.544
Right when I wake up.

00:20:31.304 --> 00:20:34.906
Let's do... Thank you, Ruffians!

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:36.627
Thank you!

00:20:36.727 --> 00:20:38.328
Doggy pack, doggy pack, doggy pack.

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:55.377
You know, we talked about some lighter topics, more celebratory topics and happy things, but we have a misunderstanding.

00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:57.840
This one's kind of heavy.

00:20:59.682 --> 00:21:00.223
Yeah.

00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:02.611
I don't know anything.

00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:03.772
Moco-chan.

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:14.735
Well, during our Splash Party Day 1 What's Along With Avin, which kind of turned into a very happy, mostly happy chit-chatting collab stream.

00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.516
Moco-chan, this girl here.

00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:18.256
Oh, me?

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:18.956
Yeah, you.

00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:22.777
Kind of said something very out of character.

00:21:22.837 --> 00:21:23.438
Was it?

00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:24.218
Yeah, it was.

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:26.439
Do you know what it was, Ruffians?

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.220
Did it take you off guard just as much as it did me?

00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:39.756
So, I was talking about how before I move on from this world, I would like to see actual fireflies.

00:21:39.796 --> 00:21:41.717
But I think a lot of Ruffians might have misunderstood it.

00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:02.752
And, and, maybe all of Advent also misunderstood it!

00:22:02.772 --> 00:22:03.492
Me too!

00:22:04.433 --> 00:22:05.733
I'm still sort of confused.

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:22.997
But you know, sometimes I just say things, and they should come out one way, and then they didn't, but I wasn't really listening to what I said, so that's why Fuwawa is here to catch anything strange that I say, but obviously she just wasn't doing her job right, so...

00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:24.077
Yeah.

00:22:24.637 --> 00:22:27.259
Yeah, it wasn't supposed to be anything dark.

00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:30.980
Just that I want to see the fireflies before I move on.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.061
That's all.

00:22:34.742 --> 00:22:40.865
I thought, you know, I'd add on because I thought Moco-chan was trying to say something maybe a bit deeper with more of a positive message.

00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:42.705
No, I just want to see fireflies.

00:22:43.066 --> 00:22:50.549
I added on, you know, that we should be grateful for every summer that we have too, you know, because even though summer feels like it'll be back every

00:22:50.809 --> 00:22:52.892
You never really know, right?

00:22:53.352 --> 00:22:56.976
So that's why we need to enjoy, you know, our everyday together.

00:22:56.996 --> 00:22:57.076
Yeah.

00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:01.423
It wasn't supposed to be that deep or anything.

00:23:01.503 --> 00:23:04.606
Just a reminder to be grateful for what we have, you know?

00:23:04.646 --> 00:23:05.366
Yeah!

00:23:05.887 --> 00:23:11.010
But, in other words, Moco-chan, seeing fireflies is on your bucket list, right?

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.411
Yeah!

00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:12.591
I wanna see fireflies.

00:23:12.912 --> 00:23:14.193
Just something simple.

00:23:14.413 --> 00:23:15.854
Nothing deep, nothing dark.

00:23:16.154 --> 00:23:16.714
You got it!

00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:22.118
Misunderstanding... Misunderstanding understood!

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:23.299
Understood?

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.561
Understandable.

00:23:25.581 --> 00:23:26.722
I just wanna see fireflies.

00:23:28.883 --> 00:23:29.143
Yeah.

00:23:29.963 --> 00:23:30.444
Understood?

00:23:30.464 --> 00:23:32.404
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:33.765
Okay, good.

00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:34.705
BAU BAU!

00:23:34.725 --> 00:23:35.405
That's good, that's good.

00:23:35.825 --> 00:23:38.186
I don't know why you didn't understand to begin with.

00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:40.267
It's all their fault.

00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:42.647
The way you said it was really scary.

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:44.308
I said nothing weird.

00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:46.509
Did you hear the missus' reaction?

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:48.689
She started to talk about snacks instead.

00:23:48.749 --> 00:23:50.010
I thought she was just hungry.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.771
She's hungry a lot.

00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:54.211
Everybody was like, what?

00:23:54.631 --> 00:23:54.831
What?

00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:55.392
What?

00:23:57.052 --> 00:23:57.572
I don't know.

00:23:57.592 --> 00:23:58.893
It is weird.

00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:06.096
I felt the air change, though.

00:24:06.356 --> 00:24:08.357
Well, on to happier things.

00:24:08.938 --> 00:24:10.038
Ruffians!

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:13.260
Our FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.261
You didn't forget about it, right?

00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:22.124
Last week, we announced that we're looking for a jingle created by you, Ruffians, for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:24:22.384 --> 00:24:23.144
Do you remember it?

00:24:23.164 --> 00:24:25.025
Yeah, the show that's happening right now.

00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:26.106
Right now, right here.

00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:28.627
We wanted to say a big thank you.

00:24:28.647 --> 00:24:31.850
We've already received so many wonderful submissions.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.931
Thank you!

00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:37.734
It's gonna be hard to choose just one.

00:24:39.195 --> 00:24:41.697
To be honest, I'm not looking forward to that at all.

00:24:42.978 --> 00:24:47.361
But we're so happy to see what a creative and fearless bunch you are.

00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:47.841
Right?

00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:48.622
Fear.

00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:49.282
No fear.

00:24:49.302 --> 00:24:53.364
Ruffians don't fear anything, especially not making jingles.

00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:58.247
And we've seen that there's a lot of newbies that have been submitting their jingles too.

00:24:58.468 --> 00:24:59.128
It's perfect.

00:24:59.168 --> 00:25:00.689
I'm really happy.

00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:03.651
That's exactly what we wanted to see.

00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:08.534
You know, let's always do our best to challenge ourselves in new areas too, right?

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:16.194
And I think, you know, there was a few Ruffians wondering where exactly we'll be using it during FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:25:16.234 --> 00:25:17.234
So we wanted to explain.

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:17.955
It's important.

00:25:18.335 --> 00:25:22.077
At the beginning of... The beginning of every episode, right?

00:25:22.478 --> 00:25:28.821
You know, once we transition into the studio, it would go right before we say, Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:30.822
You know, it's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.083
That's the thing, you know?

00:25:32.143 --> 00:25:34.885
So we would go, beep boop boop boop boop, and then we'd go, Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:25:34.905 --> 00:25:36.006
That kind of thing, you know?

00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:36.766
And play there.

00:25:37.226 --> 00:25:38.227
You know, uh...

00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:43.032
But it'd be the first thing that all the Ruffians hear in the morning.

00:25:43.192 --> 00:25:45.034
It'd be the first thing they show.

00:25:45.395 --> 00:25:46.276
That's what we're thinking.

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:49.019
And it can just be like a simple beep-bop.

00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:51.382
You know, so please just give it a shot.

00:25:53.624 --> 00:25:59.969
You can submit as many times as you like, so if you submit one and you're like, oh, I had an even better idea, go for it!

00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:01.390
Yeah, you don't have to overthink.

00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:05.393
It's just supposed to be something with you and us.

00:26:05.513 --> 00:26:09.956
Yeah, we said up to 10 seconds, but you know it could be much, much shorter.

00:26:10.016 --> 00:26:17.902
It could be 1 second, it could be 2 seconds, it could be 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, 6 seconds, 7 seconds, 8 seconds, 9 seconds, 10 seconds.

00:26:17.922 --> 00:26:18.422
That's it.

00:26:18.602 --> 00:26:19.983
Serious.

00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:20.544
10 seconds.

00:26:23.225 --> 00:26:27.887
But, you know, we really want to make FUWAMOCO Morning a show made by us and you.

00:26:28.747 --> 00:26:30.327
Bring us all together, you know!

00:26:30.347 --> 00:26:31.728
We hope that it can bring us together.

00:26:32.168 --> 00:26:36.149
And that this is maybe just another step to do that.

00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:37.269
Another step to that.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:46.592
And as a reminder, I know we have it written here, but submissions close on September 3rd, which is a little less than a week away from now.

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:51.093
Please keep that in mind while you enjoy yourself.

00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:54.914
And let's jingle all together happily.

00:26:55.975 --> 00:26:59.556
Happy jingling!

00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:02.357
Happy jingle!

00:27:02.377 --> 00:27:03.537
Moco-chan.

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:08.498
The next thing we have is the time for that time of the day.

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:09.639
I think it is!

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:10.419
It is!

00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:14.940
We have... Doggie of the Day!

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.921
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:21.431
Butters!

00:27:21.771 --> 00:27:25.172
Butters has A++ puppy dog eyes.

00:27:25.252 --> 00:27:26.052
Big eyes.

00:27:26.072 --> 00:27:28.013
It might even be better than eyes.

00:27:28.393 --> 00:27:29.393
What do you think, Moco-chan?

00:27:30.494 --> 00:27:36.995
Let's see.

00:27:37.476 --> 00:27:38.376
BAU BAU.

00:27:39.876 --> 00:27:40.857
BAU BAU.

00:27:41.717 --> 00:27:43.417
Moco-chan, you trying?

00:27:43.477 --> 00:27:44.538
Head pat.

00:27:48.228 --> 00:27:49.390
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:50.892
Nah.

00:27:51.332 --> 00:27:51.533
Nah.

00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:54.337
I think Butters does it better.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.121
Can't beat Butters.

00:28:01.281 --> 00:28:03.761
Butters loves to make friends with everyone.

00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.482
Butters is a bit scared of children.

00:28:05.762 --> 00:28:07.082
Makes sense.

00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:07.942
I get that.

00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:11.783
You know, kids can sort of be a bit loud and chaotic.

00:28:13.123 --> 00:28:17.604
It can be a bit scary because, you know, sometimes they just want to touch your ears and tails.

00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:19.144
So go for it, you know.

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:19.504
No touch!

00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:27.793
But Butters also likes to wrestle and play tug-of-war at Ruff House.

00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:29.535
A bit tough, a bit soft.

00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:31.578
Kinda sounds like you, Moco-chan.

00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:38.207
We hope you have lots of fun everyday, Mamas!

00:28:39.147 --> 00:28:40.428
How does butter is BAU BAU?

00:28:40.448 --> 00:28:45.894
I feel like, you know, maybe butter is smooth but a little bit flurly too.

00:28:45.934 --> 00:28:49.178
Flurly BAU BAU?

00:28:49.278 --> 00:28:50.119
It's really soft.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.182
That's the buttery part.

00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:54.003
That's poppy.

00:28:54.223 --> 00:28:55.224
Like a popcorn with butter.

00:28:55.244 --> 00:28:57.707
Popcorn with butter BAU.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.713
Butters is a dog who loves to play and be a friend with everyone.

00:29:06.753 --> 00:29:09.655
Maybe everyone bigger than her.

00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:11.457
Very good tail too.

00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:12.597
Right?

00:29:12.697 --> 00:29:13.638
Nice tail.

00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:14.398
Big ears!

00:29:14.498 --> 00:29:15.699
The ears are very cute.

00:29:15.939 --> 00:29:17.220
I'm not envious.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.242
The bigger the ears, the bigger the heart.

00:29:19.782 --> 00:29:21.303
Are you saying my heart is small?

00:29:21.383 --> 00:29:21.543
Yes.

00:29:21.983 --> 00:29:23.785
BAU BAU!

00:29:27.334 --> 00:29:30.098
That's all it is, huh?

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:32.701
It's still just the morning.

00:29:32.721 --> 00:29:35.064
Thank you!

00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:42.345
And next for today, I went on a walk!

00:29:42.705 --> 00:29:45.127
We have... De-den!

00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:47.528
What is this?

00:29:47.969 --> 00:29:52.552
Violence.

00:29:52.912 --> 00:29:58.616
Did our neighborhood walk turn into something much different?

00:29:59.957 --> 00:30:01.639
It looks like you came across...

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:04.500
A food festival and wrestling!

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.060
This definitely looks like a good meal.

00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:11.262
Can you eat wrestling?

00:30:11.322 --> 00:30:12.142
That's cute!

00:30:12.262 --> 00:30:13.963
It's pretty cool!

00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:15.743
It looks like you had a great time.

00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:23.745
I think that's one of the things I love the most about walks is that you can discover really cool things and you never know what you're going to find.

00:30:23.846 --> 00:30:24.946
It really brings up your mood.

00:30:25.806 --> 00:30:30.008
I just went outside for a walk, but then suddenly everybody's happy!

00:30:30.048 --> 00:30:30.588
You know?

00:30:30.968 --> 00:30:39.571
Like, sometimes you kind of get stuck in your world, but then when you go out on a walk, then you realize, oh, there's a lot of other worlds going on outside of them.

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:39.971
You know?

00:30:39.991 --> 00:30:43.932
And then that way you can kind of stretch your paws, change things up a bit.

00:30:44.372 --> 00:30:44.993
You know?

00:30:45.313 --> 00:30:46.073
It's really refreshing.

00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:46.593
It's nice.

00:30:46.753 --> 00:30:48.334
You know?

00:30:48.354 --> 00:30:51.295
But Moco-chan and I wrestling it out in that window.

00:30:52.711 --> 00:30:55.033
I'm the one punching.

00:30:55.133 --> 00:30:56.293
No, I'm the one punching.

00:30:56.313 --> 00:30:58.695
He looks like he's gonna eat a knuckle sandwich.

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.376
It's obvious which one I am.

00:31:01.757 --> 00:31:09.521
I don't like sandwiches, so... Well, you know, you never know what you might see when you go outside for a walk.

00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:13.484
Maybe one day if you go outside for a walk, you'll find us wrestling it out.

00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:14.024
BAU BAU!

00:31:14.044 --> 00:31:14.424
Thank you!

00:31:19.922 --> 00:31:23.564
And next, for our Question of the Day!

00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:24.585
What do we have?

00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:26.126
De-den!

00:31:27.206 --> 00:31:32.150
Congratulations on reaching over 500,000 people and opening a membership!

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:32.710
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.151
Thank you!

00:31:34.551 --> 00:31:38.894
The question is, what is the relationship between FUWAMOCO and Ruffians?

00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:41.336
Example, just friends?

00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:42.276
Family?

00:31:42.877 --> 00:31:42.937
Or...

00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:47.408
Oh, this is a good question.

00:31:47.428 --> 00:31:49.689
Ruffians, are you curious too?

00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:50.769
Nice question, nice question.

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:51.629
Nice question.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.810
Yeah.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.771
What is our relationship?

00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:55.951
Very good question.

00:31:56.011 --> 00:32:01.414
Well, for us, you're someone very, very, very important and dear to us.

00:32:01.634 --> 00:32:04.235
You're someone we look up to.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.176
Someone that we know will be there for us during hard times.

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:07.797
Hopefully.

00:32:08.437 --> 00:32:09.817
Hopefully!

00:32:10.258 --> 00:32:11.338
Not doubting it, right, Moco-chan?

00:32:11.378 --> 00:32:13.379
No, I'm not doubting it.

00:32:13.439 --> 00:32:15.360
But friends or family or...

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.791
I think you know that's up to you.

00:32:19.191 --> 00:32:26.215
I feel like it might be kind of strange of us to just decide that without consulting you first.

00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.536
It's for you.

00:32:29.957 --> 00:32:35.500
So if you think of us as your family or daughters, then we're your daughters.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.541
And if we're best buddies, then best buddies.

00:32:39.202 --> 00:32:41.623
And if it's something else, then...

00:32:43.342 --> 00:32:45.694
It's a bit embarrassing, but do you understand?

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.551
Understood?

00:32:48.731 --> 00:32:49.351
Understood!

00:32:50.072 --> 00:32:51.473
I don't get it.

00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:54.996
Probably like a scary family.

00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:57.117
No, more of a happy family.

00:32:57.377 --> 00:32:57.938
Happy.

00:32:58.438 --> 00:32:58.919
You know.

00:32:59.639 --> 00:33:00.220
Understood.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.481
Good.

00:33:02.642 --> 00:33:03.562
We're Doggy Pack.

00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:04.723
Doggy Pack.

00:33:04.763 --> 00:33:07.245
Good, good, good.

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.506
That's such a good question though.

00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:08.986
BAU BAU!

00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:10.748
BAU BAU!

00:33:11.008 --> 00:33:11.428
Thank you!

00:33:11.508 --> 00:33:12.950
And Ruffians, remember.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.534
Gotta remember, we're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day.

00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:20.376
We want to hear more about your works.

00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:22.358
Of course, questions too.

00:33:22.398 --> 00:33:24.519
Please don't hesitate to submit them.

00:33:24.579 --> 00:33:26.901
Use the hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:33:29.178 --> 00:33:35.620
You might think that they'll never pick up my submissions.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.881
But we have our eyes open.

00:33:37.961 --> 00:33:38.921
We have our eyes open.

00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:40.622
We're always looking.

00:33:41.482 --> 00:33:43.082
We'll be waiting, okay, Ruffians?

00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:44.163
Thank you!

00:33:44.203 --> 00:33:44.903
BAU BAU!

00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:45.683
BAU BAU!

00:33:46.563 --> 00:33:50.104
As for our next team... Next up is... Den!

00:33:53.029 --> 00:34:03.795
We're playing The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, but you know, this might be our first evening without going live tonight.

00:34:03.835 --> 00:34:06.916
This is actually tomorrow's stream.

00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:09.098
We're going to be going back to Haibu.

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:14.243
We just left the Kokiri Village and now we have our Ocarina.

00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:16.004
Our journey's just starting, right?

00:34:16.545 --> 00:34:18.006
Just the beginning.

00:34:18.207 --> 00:34:25.574
We're really really excited to be playing our original game, the game cartridge on our original hardware, the N64.

00:34:25.654 --> 00:34:27.897
Do you know what that is?

00:34:28.848 --> 00:34:31.950
Probably not.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.372
We started it out last week.

00:34:35.712 --> 00:34:42.536
And we felt a bit sad that we couldn't play longer, so this time we want to play more!

00:34:43.537 --> 00:34:48.139
We'll also be reading today's Super Chats after this Zelda stream.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:35:00.606
The Super Chats from FUWAMOCO Morning today right now will be after Zelda.

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:08.150
As for you know, like I mentioned, this is gonna be our first evening where we're not going live.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.912
So, you know what we feel?

00:35:13.356 --> 00:35:14.216
We feel funny, you know?

00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:16.077
We're gonna miss you a lot.

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:22.260
But this week, we can focus on getting some of our homeworks done, as well as resting up too.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.681
The things that we have to get done, you know?

00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:30.443
But while we're doing that, you know, we thought we'd ask Mama Puppy.

00:35:30.643 --> 00:35:35.565
She has a recommended stream for, like a stream archive for Ruffians to watch.

00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:39.747
And maybe, Ruffians, could you guess what she recommended?

00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:41.807
Just maybe?

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:41.867
Oh?

00:35:42.148 --> 00:35:42.248
Oh?

00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:48.637
Well, Mama Puppy... She recommended... De-den!

00:35:49.117 --> 00:35:52.321
Our first Arcade of Time.

00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:54.283
She really enjoyed it.

00:35:54.604 --> 00:35:58.548
It's a game that's very special to all of us, but she'd like it if...

00:35:59.509 --> 00:36:00.210
You can watch it.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.510
We like that too.

00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:11.277
It's pretty short, so if you weren't able to catch us live, you can watch, catch up, find out just what happened, and then join us tomorrow for the second part.

00:36:11.757 --> 00:36:14.619
Mama Puppy thought it was funny that her save data was there too.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.961
So please check it out, okay?

00:36:19.281 --> 00:36:20.621
It's pretty bite-sized, I think.

00:36:21.142 --> 00:36:25.904
Not as bite-sized as FUWAMOCO Morning, but... Thank you!

00:36:26.004 --> 00:36:35.828
And if we take a little peek at our schedule... This week, we're playing some games we've played before and some new games.

00:36:35.868 --> 00:36:39.730
We also have our one-month celebration happening on Wednesday.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.597
I know it's kind of funny not being on a weekend, but that's because it's exactly one month to debut.

00:36:45.717 --> 00:36:49.582
We're also going to be going back to River City.

00:36:49.622 --> 00:36:56.932
We're going to punch, kick, whack our enemies and find boyfriends.

00:36:57.953 --> 00:36:58.554
I don't know.

00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:00.555
It's a bit of an embarrassing story.

00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:02.857
I don't really feel like it represents me.

00:37:02.917 --> 00:37:06.319
Moco-chan, do you feel like it represents violence?

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.260
I want violence.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.801
I want violence.

00:37:09.262 --> 00:37:12.364
But you know, we can show everyone just how strong a team we are.

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:14.566
Please join us!

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:15.706
Thank you!

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.868
Hopefully I get better than last time.

00:37:18.408 --> 00:37:18.829
I don't know.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:20.550
I'd like to show some improvement.

00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:22.892
I see, I see.

00:37:22.972 --> 00:37:24.413
I might have to warm up a little.

00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:28.019
Thank you Ruffians!

00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:29.943
BAU BAU!

00:37:30.544 --> 00:37:36.336
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:37:38.018 --> 00:37:38.459

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.721
This was FUWAMOCO Morning!
