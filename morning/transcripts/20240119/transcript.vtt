05:12.270 --> 05:14.706
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:15.307 --> 05:18.734
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:18.754 --> 05:22.763
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.883 --> 05:23.224
BAU BAU!

05:25.322 --> 05:28.223
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:28.703 --> 05:31.064
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:31.264 --> 05:33.245
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:33.285 --> 05:36.126
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:36.766 --> 05:41.287
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.747 --> 05:48.890
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 70th Anniversary!

05:48.930 --> 05:50.190
BAU BAU!

05:51.178 --> 05:55.562
Episode 70.

05:56.102 --> 06:00.146
It feels like just the other day, you know, was like the 12th episode.

06:00.266 --> 06:01.267
Right!

06:02.648 --> 06:05.150
BAU BAU!

06:05.671 --> 06:07.993
Thank you for joining us, Ruffians.

06:08.313 --> 06:14.659
Not just today, but for all the other episodes of FUWAMOCO Morning that you've been here.

06:14.739 --> 06:17.181
The 70 mornings we're able to start you out with!

06:17.421 --> 06:17.841
Right!

06:18.522 --> 06:22.345
Well, and hopefully many many more from here on.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.248
But, maybe this is your first morning joining us.

06:26.348 --> 06:36.076
Well, to explain about FUWAMOCO Morning, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:36.396 --> 06:36.876
A.K.A.

06:36.936 --> 06:37.817
FUWAMOCO!

06:38.137 --> 06:41.440
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:42.200 --> 06:47.425
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:47.725 --> 06:53.049
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:53.510 --> 06:57.553
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:57.973 --> 07:00.996
BAU BAU!

07:01.817 --> 07:04.038
It's a very happy FUWAMOCO Morning.

07:04.259 --> 07:06.140
Almost a weekend too, right?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.002
Extra, extra happy.

07:09.995 --> 07:13.397
Yeah, so many episodes of Great Mornings.

07:13.997 --> 07:15.778
BAU BAU!

07:19.559 --> 07:31.284
I'm sorry to put a bit of a downer on our 70th episode, but there's been another Pero Sighting.

07:33.677 --> 07:35.998
There's too many recently, Ruffians.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.499
More Pero Sightings and Misunderstandings.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.860
Well, two bad things.

07:41.080 --> 07:46.782
I guess... Less bad things is better, but... Less bad things is better, okay?

07:47.862 --> 07:50.243
Well, where was Pero spotted?

07:50.263 --> 07:50.923
Let's see!

07:50.963 --> 07:51.123
Well...

08:02.768 --> 08:09.191
I guess Pero kinda got a bit hungry during his travels and was led here by the good smell, maybe?

08:09.231 --> 08:10.351
That makes sense.

08:10.471 --> 08:11.572
They look pretty good.

08:11.612 --> 08:12.072
Yeah!

08:12.712 --> 08:15.153
They're like takoyaki, but ebi-yaki.

08:15.193 --> 08:18.095
So I guess instead of tako, ebi.

08:18.475 --> 08:19.775
Ah, cool!

08:20.136 --> 08:23.917
I guess maybe some people prefer shrimp to octopus.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.658
You know, that's one of the great things about takoyaki.

08:26.938 --> 08:28.999
You can just put in whatever you want most.

08:31.041 --> 08:34.667
Moco-chan, what would you want to put into it next?

08:43.245 --> 08:46.087
I like putting beni shoga in.

08:46.528 --> 08:47.468
It's not meat though.

08:48.129 --> 08:52.512
Beni shoga is just like a pickled ginger, but it's red.

08:52.812 --> 08:53.533
It's red.

08:53.613 --> 08:57.676
It's different from, you know, the juicy ginger.

08:57.916 --> 08:58.776
But it's not meat.

09:00.378 --> 09:02.279
Natto, no!

09:02.599 --> 09:03.460
You could, but...

09:05.128 --> 09:08.491
If it's fun and it's yummy, then it's good!

09:08.791 --> 09:09.391
Pudding!

09:10.192 --> 09:10.732
Onions!

09:10.952 --> 09:11.513
Pizza!

09:11.573 --> 09:12.393
Pero?

09:13.754 --> 09:14.735
Pero Yaki?

09:14.875 --> 09:15.415
I don't know.

09:15.435 --> 09:18.858
Pero is more like the Bakudan Yaki sounds.

09:19.543 --> 09:20.904
They're really big ones.

09:21.504 --> 09:23.605
Yeah, it's like a big takoyaki.

09:23.645 --> 09:24.465
Big!

09:24.525 --> 09:25.646
But, yeah.

09:26.526 --> 09:27.626
A bit difficult to eat.

09:28.887 --> 09:36.430
Yeah, but as for liking shrimp or octopus more, I don't know if Pero really has any preferences.

09:36.730 --> 09:39.071
I think he probably just wanted some yummy food here, right?

09:39.111 --> 09:42.893
I guess he probably would like it more if it was pudding, huh?

09:43.173 --> 09:44.113
Pudding-yaki?

09:44.954 --> 09:46.714
If that's the case, he could have that, I guess.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.214
Crumbly.

09:49.266 --> 09:51.447
But you didn't give him one though, right?

09:52.767 --> 09:58.209
Cause you know, if you feed him... Chaos.

10:00.049 --> 10:05.071
Well, hopefully he just continued on his way and your stomach wasn't affected.

10:05.091 --> 10:05.411
Right!

10:06.530 --> 10:06.990
Hopefully.

10:07.931 --> 10:09.932
Good luck with the FWM!

10:10.072 --> 10:12.313
BAU BAU!

10:12.733 --> 10:13.333
That's cool.

10:13.373 --> 10:14.934
I wanna do that.

10:14.954 --> 10:17.195
Can we take over for a day?

10:17.215 --> 10:18.736
Yeah!

10:18.776 --> 10:20.837
Ichinichi Tenjou!

10:20.957 --> 10:22.858
That way hopefully we can keep Pero away.

10:22.878 --> 10:26.520
BAU BAU!

10:27.380 --> 10:28.301
Ruffians!

10:28.861 --> 10:33.283
Very very soon, something cool is gonna be coming out.

10:33.323 --> 10:35.044
Do you remember what that is?

10:36.286 --> 10:36.907
Well!

10:38.968 --> 10:44.412
It's hololive English's cover of this song, Minecraft!

10:44.952 --> 10:47.214
It's coming out really soon!

10:47.334 --> 10:55.420
Yeah, it's premiering on Bae Senpai's channel at 7pm PT tomorrow during our Thief Simulator 2 stream.

10:56.903 --> 10:57.864
I'm kind of disappointed.

10:57.964 --> 11:06.929
I wish we could have been there for the premiere, but FUWAMOCO, we kind of... And then, it's a bit tricky when we're mid-game.

11:07.269 --> 11:09.811
Can the stealing stop for a moment, Moco-chan?

11:09.951 --> 11:10.851
We'll have to see.

11:11.072 --> 11:14.414
But we hope that you'll make sure to be there in Tequila, okay?

11:14.474 --> 11:15.234
Don't forget!

11:15.274 --> 11:17.335
You'll miss out if you forget, okay?

11:17.355 --> 11:19.417
This is why we're reminding you, okay?

11:20.437 --> 11:27.439
It's a really, really emotional song and we're just really so happy and thankful to be included.

11:28.159 --> 11:32.100
Let's all make sure to put it into our calendars, okay, Ruffians?

11:32.741 --> 11:37.802
BAU BAU!

11:38.262 --> 11:41.663
There's also something cool going on, but Ruffians!

11:41.863 --> 11:44.364
You know that FUWAMOCO, we kinda, we like figures.

11:44.824 --> 11:45.824
Anime figures.

11:46.284 --> 11:47.205
But, do you?

11:52.580 --> 11:53.641
Ichiyo!

11:53.801 --> 11:55.442
Ichiyo.

11:55.502 --> 11:56.163
Yeah!

11:56.203 --> 11:57.724
I really like figures!

11:57.824 --> 12:00.466
You know, I still remember my first figure ever.

12:01.506 --> 12:03.928
It was actually by Good Smile Company.

12:04.268 --> 12:08.351
I feel like Good Smile Company didn't have that many figures still out back then.

12:08.471 --> 12:08.931
I don't know!

12:08.951 --> 12:12.154
But I still love her very very very much.

12:12.754 --> 12:25.302
Yeah, well, actually, Good Smile Company currently has a very special survey out to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the POP UP PARADE series!

12:25.602 --> 12:27.804
Ah, the figure line!

12:27.824 --> 12:30.125
Do you have any POP UP PARADE figures?

12:30.966 --> 12:32.627
Ruffians, maybe.

12:33.460 --> 12:48.666
With this survey, Good Smile Company, they want to know what characters you want to see in the series next!

12:49.626 --> 12:50.967
So, that means Ruffians...

12:51.887 --> 12:52.948
This is your chance!

12:53.728 --> 13:01.413
If you want to see us FUWAMOCO as POP UP PARADE Figures, please let them know, okay?

13:01.453 --> 13:03.154
Be passionate!

13:03.415 --> 13:03.995
Passionate!

13:04.055 --> 13:05.836
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

13:05.876 --> 13:06.977
Papa Pre FUWAMOCO!

13:07.017 --> 13:07.657
BAU BAU BAU!

13:07.697 --> 13:10.239
Let's probably use some more words, don't you?

13:10.319 --> 13:11.160
Words are good.

13:12.321 --> 13:14.223
Yeah, but also, you know what?

13:14.744 --> 13:21.452
If you answer this survey, you could also get a chance to win five purple parade figures of your choice too!

13:22.839 --> 13:23.880
Let them know, okay?

13:23.900 --> 13:28.543
Yeah, you can find this survey on Good Smile USA's Twitter account.

13:28.703 --> 13:35.147
So please let them know what you want to see from them, be it FUWAMOCO or maybe your favorite anime characters too.

13:35.267 --> 13:36.288
Yeah, okay!

13:36.488 --> 13:39.850
Let's continue to love figures lots and lots, okay Ruffians?

13:40.611 --> 13:43.273
BAU BAU!

13:43.933 --> 13:47.676
Recently we've been kind of looking at figures a bit more, Ruffians.

13:49.257 --> 13:54.300
It's just so wonderful to have like a living representation of what you really are.

13:54.380 --> 13:54.900
I know.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.682
To be able to see at all different angles.

13:58.022 --> 13:58.742
Pero figure.

13:58.762 --> 14:00.103
You don't need a Pero figure.

14:00.343 --> 14:01.964
There's not a lot of angles there.

14:02.264 --> 14:02.865
No.

14:03.505 --> 14:03.885
Okay.

14:03.985 --> 14:04.706
Just curves.

14:04.946 --> 14:05.386
BAU BAU!

14:05.426 --> 14:05.626
Wow.

14:13.089 --> 14:14.971
There's a bit of an update, Ruffians.

14:15.552 --> 14:17.615
Update, a bit of a BAU BAU.

14:18.857 --> 14:26.788
Well, it seems like Matsuri-senpai, like her BAU BAU view is kinda getting a bit bad again.

14:27.879 --> 14:31.503
Yeah, her condition isn't looking too good.

14:31.523 --> 14:33.926
It's not looking good, Ruffians.

14:34.667 --> 14:45.502
During a chatting stream she had just the other day, she was mentioning how she likes licking the fingers of other hololive members.

14:46.787 --> 14:47.748
Uh, yeah.

14:48.328 --> 14:52.311
But, she said that she could never do that to FUWAMOCO.

14:52.811 --> 14:56.074
That she just wants to observe us, not touch.

14:56.454 --> 14:57.995
That's probably for the best!

14:58.215 --> 15:00.837
Yeah.

15:01.017 --> 15:07.462
I don't know what might happen if Matsuri-senpai wants to try to like us.

15:09.335 --> 15:11.416
At the very least, you know running.

15:11.676 --> 15:13.017
Running is an option.

15:13.037 --> 15:13.698
An option?

15:14.098 --> 15:21.242
But I don't know if violence might accidentally occur either.

15:21.342 --> 15:22.663
That's a way to describe it.

15:22.783 --> 15:24.044
Yeah.

15:24.104 --> 15:31.549
You know, originally we thought that maybe there might be senpai trying to touch our ears or tails.

15:31.589 --> 15:36.892
We didn't expect there to be senpai who would think about trying to lick our fingers.

15:38.072 --> 15:41.956
That wasn't a concern, but now... It's a bit of a concern!

15:43.078 --> 15:49.184
If Matsuri-senpai wants to watch us from afar though, does that make her a wall too?

15:49.485 --> 15:53.369
Does Matsuri-senpai want to be a mom or a wall?

15:53.869 --> 15:54.649
Our wall mom?

15:55.290 --> 15:55.910
What is it?

15:56.510 --> 15:59.231
Well, now we'll be surrounded by two walls, you know.

15:59.571 --> 16:02.733
A Rui-senpai wall and a Matsuri-senpai wall.

16:02.773 --> 16:03.713
Yeah.

16:03.933 --> 16:06.414
Soon we'll have so many walls we could build a house.

16:08.155 --> 16:10.176
BAU BAU!

16:10.256 --> 16:13.757
Matsuri-senpai, please feel better.

16:14.338 --> 16:14.898
Better?

16:15.378 --> 16:15.858
Better soon.

16:15.878 --> 16:16.178
Good luck!

16:16.198 --> 16:22.481
If you think of Rui-ne-senpai as a wall and Matsuri-senpai as a wall, they're very different walls though, right?

16:23.516 --> 16:24.377
Towa.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.657
Smawa.

16:26.598 --> 16:27.399
Wawa.

16:27.419 --> 16:28.700
Wanderwa.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.200
What?

16:29.920 --> 16:37.225
BAU BAU!

16:37.846 --> 16:38.646
Ruffians!

16:39.367 --> 16:40.588
You know FUWAMOCO.

16:40.648 --> 16:42.189
We're ruffians.

16:42.229 --> 16:43.229
We're fuzzy.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.031
We're FUWAMOCO, right?

16:46.011 --> 16:49.073
But you also know of Moco-chan's special power.

16:49.293 --> 16:49.854
Right!

16:50.254 --> 16:51.115
My special power.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.045
Right?

16:54.525 --> 16:54.685
Right?

16:54.705 --> 16:54.925
Ruffians!

16:54.965 --> 17:02.067
The power to sneeze, yeah!

17:02.447 --> 17:05.047
Extraordinary sneezes!

17:05.147 --> 17:06.308
It took you a while.

17:06.488 --> 17:07.568
It did.

17:09.608 --> 17:17.070
Well, it turns out that Moco-chan's almost at a total of 200 on-stream sneezes!

17:17.110 --> 17:17.990
Yeah!

17:18.070 --> 17:19.710
In six months, not even!

17:20.090 --> 17:22.251
That's nothing to sneeze at, right?

17:24.534 --> 17:24.794
Yeah.

17:25.755 --> 17:26.255
I don't know.

17:26.355 --> 17:30.217
If that's not extraordinary, then I don't know what is, huh?

17:31.918 --> 17:36.800
Yeah, but, uh, Ruffians... I don't know.

17:38.041 --> 17:45.805
Slowly, it seems like Moco-chan's sneezes are kind of being thought of as a given or normal.

17:45.825 --> 17:47.586
You know, it's just something that happens.

17:47.606 --> 17:50.608
It's a normal everyday FUWAMOCO's dream.

17:50.628 --> 17:52.489
Hmm.

17:55.083 --> 17:55.944
Ruffians.

17:58.726 --> 18:01.027
Do you not like my sneezes anymore?

18:02.328 --> 18:04.530
Just because it isn't rare done.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.591
You don't want it.

18:06.672 --> 18:15.058
It's not something to celebrate because it's just commonplace everyday stuff now.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.490
Would it be better for me not to sneeze?

18:19.011 --> 18:21.091
Should I just mute what I feel when coming on?

18:21.931 --> 18:24.712
Does it gross you out now?

18:24.732 --> 18:27.073
I get it.

18:28.253 --> 18:30.613
Nothing that I do is special anymore, huh?

18:32.374 --> 18:35.214
That's how it is, huh?

18:36.735 --> 18:37.155
I get it.

18:38.928 --> 18:41.530
Well, I guess I'll aim for 200.

18:41.710 --> 18:49.795
And then, maybe then, I'll retire from being the strongest sneezer in all of hololive, okay?

18:49.815 --> 18:50.956
Retire?

18:51.576 --> 18:53.317
I guess that's how it has to be, huh?

18:53.738 --> 18:57.140
BAU BAU.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.262
Well, it's good that you've made your decision, huh Moco-chan?

19:01.823 --> 19:02.443
Ruffians!

19:03.024 --> 19:04.845
Moco-chan's came to a decision.

19:07.217 --> 19:08.158
It's just commonplace.

19:08.238 --> 19:08.838
It's just normal.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.339
It's kind of gross, actually.

19:13.601 --> 19:14.762
That's how you think, huh?

19:18.324 --> 19:18.924
BAU BAU!

19:20.445 --> 19:23.767
I hope I can do something that seems special to you, okay?

19:23.787 --> 19:25.168
I hope!

19:28.270 --> 19:28.871
It happens.

19:29.311 --> 19:31.172
Just like the misunderstandings, huh?

19:33.153 --> 19:34.294
Where did they go after all?

19:35.691 --> 19:37.272
I don't know, that's the biggest mystery of 2024.

19:37.472 --> 19:37.672
But!

19:37.772 --> 19:47.037
Well, Ruffians, you know that this week, we had a double watch-along.

19:47.077 --> 19:49.698
We watched the Kanon anime, right?

19:49.798 --> 19:50.499
Yeah, we did!

19:51.754 --> 19:56.879
Unsurprisingly, it made us cry lots and lots and lots.

19:57.219 --> 20:01.743
We also briefly mentioned another show that makes us cry a lot too.

20:03.084 --> 20:07.548
That show is Hajimete no Otsukai!

20:09.229 --> 20:11.211
Have you heard of it before, Ruffians?

20:11.751 --> 20:14.374
I think it's called Old Enough Overseas.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.555
Hajimete no Otsukai.

20:21.459 --> 20:23.180
It's a TV show that we really really like.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.682
It has been running for many years in Japan.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.548
Explain a bit about it.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.991
It's a show that follows a little kid's first errand that they go on all alone without their parents.

20:41.172 --> 20:47.376
So a parent would be like, go get me some rice and go on this path.

20:47.656 --> 20:48.557
Get some miso.

20:49.797 --> 20:55.622
Ask the grandpa for a fish and make sure you get this kind of fish, that kind of thing.

20:55.862 --> 20:59.804
But a lot of the kids, they're only 3 or 4 years old.

21:00.205 --> 21:01.846
So little rice!

21:01.906 --> 21:02.586
Mine's so tiny!

21:03.827 --> 21:05.388
It's really cute and heartwarming.

21:06.149 --> 21:09.411
But... It also makes us teary.

21:09.751 --> 21:13.054
We were watching it the other day together!

21:14.314 --> 21:15.475
And it's just too cute.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.696
It's so cute!

21:17.256 --> 21:27.864
Yeah, it made us kind of think about that kind of life and we started talking about a lot of silly things like, FUWAMOCO if we were parrots!

21:29.817 --> 21:36.283
You know, I always get very curious seeing the mom and dad all emotional and excited and happy throughout the show.

21:36.703 --> 21:39.725
You know, them working so hard to control themselves too.

21:40.126 --> 21:42.688
And I just like, wait... DAD!

21:42.708 --> 21:42.768
MOM!

21:45.470 --> 21:46.030
BAU BAU!

22:06.055 --> 22:13.340
You know, there was mention of us having two soccer teams for puppies way back, right?

22:13.720 --> 22:13.860
No.

22:14.281 --> 22:15.521
Back when we debuted.

22:15.561 --> 22:15.842
No.

22:16.202 --> 22:16.502
No.

22:16.622 --> 22:18.804
No, that's not happening!

22:18.844 --> 22:19.624
That's not happening.

22:19.704 --> 22:22.046
No, that's not happening.

22:22.086 --> 22:27.729
Sometimes it's nice to imagine having your own cute little kids to love and take care of.

22:28.190 --> 22:28.410
But...

22:29.167 --> 22:31.169
In the end, cats are good too.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.451
Cats are good too.

22:32.511 --> 22:34.273
And then you know, fluffy fluffy.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.155
They will go anywhere if you don't let them.

22:36.175 --> 22:38.617
And then if you get a little bit too hungry then...

22:42.488 --> 22:50.850
To summarize, Hajimete no Otsukai is a very powerful show, making us a bit silly.

22:51.710 --> 22:55.491
BAU BAU!

22:55.531 --> 22:58.872
Let's continue on to our regular corner, Shiroppo-chan.

22:59.832 --> 23:03.392
Today, we have our Doggie of the Day.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.313
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

23:06.734 --> 23:11.217
Today's Doggie of the Day is Loki!

23:11.237 --> 23:13.439
Too cute!

23:13.519 --> 23:15.440
Such a big smile!

23:15.480 --> 23:20.483
And such a pretty chew!

23:21.344 --> 23:23.566
He's apparently the baby of the family.

23:23.586 --> 23:24.586
I can tell.

23:24.646 --> 23:26.648
His nose!

23:27.068 --> 23:28.569
The fluffy chest!

23:29.229 --> 23:30.430
Very very cute.

23:30.950 --> 23:32.832
He has the milky stripe!

23:32.912 --> 23:34.313
Milky stripe!

23:37.156 --> 23:38.923
How does Loki BAU BAU?

23:40.389 --> 23:41.292
I don't know, I think he's...

23:42.216 --> 23:42.576
BAU BAU!

23:42.616 --> 23:43.177
BAU BAU!

23:43.637 --> 23:43.897

BAU BAU!

24:01.447 --> 24:01.467
B

24:08.951 --> 24:13.514
Because below him, he'll be a baby forever and ever.

24:13.915 --> 24:16.977
Especially with that cute smile.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.440
Please give him lots of head pats from us, okay?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.581
BAU BAU!

24:23.022 --> 24:23.562
So cute!

24:23.822 --> 24:24.222
And win!

24:28.855 --> 24:29.776
Today I went on a walk.

24:29.856 --> 24:34.097
We have De-den!

24:34.938 --> 24:38.219
Is this a vacation?

24:40.460 --> 24:41.861
On a hike?

24:42.281 --> 24:44.962
This is quite different from all the snowy walks we've been doing.

24:45.042 --> 24:47.563
It's nice that this is a place you can go on a hike, right?

24:48.023 --> 24:48.744
We are.

24:49.144 --> 24:49.864
You know.

24:50.725 --> 24:53.766
You know we're stumbling upon a beautifully hidden beach.

24:57.181 --> 24:57.621
I don't know.

24:58.222 --> 25:00.523
It sure seems like a vacation spot.

25:00.904 --> 25:03.706
Romantic!

25:04.306 --> 25:05.987
Romantic vacation.

25:06.347 --> 25:07.148
Not vacation.

25:07.528 --> 25:10.791
It's so pretty.

25:11.351 --> 25:12.772
I wanna go too.

25:13.272 --> 25:16.134
A hidden beach with sand.

25:16.294 --> 25:18.016
We could find a mermaid.

25:18.136 --> 25:19.817
We could be the mermaid.

25:21.044 --> 25:23.065
I'm the mermaid, Ruffians okay!

25:23.485 --> 25:24.685
Be the mermaid!

25:25.465 --> 25:26.946
BAU BAU!

25:27.526 --> 25:30.167
And next we have our Question of the Day.

25:30.187 --> 25:33.908
And for our Question of the Day we have... De-den!

25:33.928 --> 25:34.548
BAU BAU!

25:34.588 --> 25:35.969
BAU BAU!

25:36.069 --> 25:40.270
I'm curious about for how long can FUWAMOCO hold their breath for?

25:40.530 --> 25:49.473
Mococo's crazy for a get-to and endless BAU BAUs must require a lung capacity only achievable by the best Demon Guard Dogs.

25:50.515 --> 25:50.895
Wow.

25:50.915 --> 25:57.699
I think it varies depending on how much we slept and everything.

25:57.719 --> 26:02.841
You know, and how much... You know what sort of state we're in.

26:03.362 --> 26:08.944
I don't know, I feel like right now is not the best, but we'll give it a good shot.

26:09.645 --> 26:09.905
Okay.

26:10.645 --> 26:12.606
Three, two, one.

26:13.887 --> 26:16.528
Oh wait, I started too early.

26:17.009 --> 26:17.929
Okay, one more time.

26:18.009 --> 26:18.589
Okay, Moco-chan.

26:20.020 --> 26:20.563
No, I'm not.

26:20.763 --> 26:21.306
You count down.

26:21.326 --> 26:21.306
3, 2, 1.

27:21.665 --> 27:24.789
I didn't want to lose to you, Moco-chan!

27:24.809 --> 27:27.972
BAU BAU!

27:28.272 --> 27:29.493
I won!

27:29.854 --> 27:30.515
You won?

27:30.575 --> 27:31.736
No fair!

27:31.756 --> 27:31.836
Yeah.

27:31.856 --> 27:35.340
I feel like we can do better for sure.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.141
I think so too.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.325
Almost one minute!

27:40.345 --> 27:40.805
Really?

27:40.905 --> 27:41.246
Wow.

27:41.506 --> 27:42.807
The long silence.

27:47.071 --> 27:51.534
You know, we hope we can improve our lung capacity so we can sing better in the future too.

27:51.594 --> 27:58.858
Yeah, I feel like most people you don't think about lung capacity being important, but to us it's very very important.

27:58.898 --> 28:00.879
And that's why I don't think it's very good right now.

28:01.140 --> 28:01.700
Yeah.

28:02.641 --> 28:08.688
But we know we're gonna make sure that we can put more of a priority on our physical health too, right?

28:08.708 --> 28:09.509
More!

28:09.710 --> 28:10.851
Up the lung capacity.

28:11.352 --> 28:11.992
Up the stats.

28:12.393 --> 28:13.374
Up the stamina.

28:13.634 --> 28:14.996
BAU BAU!

28:15.256 --> 28:19.502
Ruffians, you make sure to chill, okay?

28:22.327 --> 28:25.611
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

28:25.991 --> 28:31.437
Your doggies, your questions, your Pero Sightings, and your walks, too.

28:31.457 --> 28:35.200
Make sure you continue to go on walks, but be safe when you go out, okay?

28:35.240 --> 28:36.842
That will help your lung capacity, too.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.344
Very slowly, but yes.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.025
Daily walks, you know?

28:40.125 --> 28:41.167
And then you'll get there.

28:42.768 --> 28:45.009
Please don't forget to use the hashtag.

28:45.069 --> 28:51.091
Hashtag FWMCMORNING or FWMC for the scoops.

28:51.151 --> 28:52.692
FWMC scoop for the scoops!

28:55.232 --> 28:56.693
Okay!

28:56.713 --> 29:00.374
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

29:00.394 --> 29:07.977
And for our next stream, we have... Abyss Karaoke Relay!

29:08.037 --> 29:10.758
The very first Karaoke Relay.

29:11.138 --> 29:13.359
will be happening today.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.660
It will start over on our channel first.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.520
We have the schedule.

29:16.781 --> 29:20.742
Our channel first will be doing an Archive Karaoke.

29:21.263 --> 29:28.966
And then after that we'll be continuing on to Shiori, then to Biboo, then to Nerissa, and then back to us.

29:29.166 --> 29:30.527
We'll be starting it.

29:31.618 --> 29:43.782
You know, I think a bunch of our favorite songs, your favorite maybe, and you know, we'll just have a really fun time singing all together with Advent today.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.183
Please join us, okay?

29:47.263 --> 29:48.323
I'm so excited.

29:48.643 --> 29:49.603
BAU BAU!

29:50.964 --> 29:53.804
Actually, I kind of hope we sing the same songs too.

29:53.824 --> 29:54.345
Oh, as other...

29:56.045 --> 29:57.725
Advent Memories!

29:57.906 --> 30:01.386
You know, you can kind of see how each member puts a spin on things.

30:01.506 --> 30:05.007
I don't know if that's going to happen, but... We don't know.

30:05.207 --> 30:05.767
We'll have to see!

30:05.787 --> 30:06.608
We'll have to see!

30:06.628 --> 30:07.648
BAU BAU!

30:08.588 --> 30:11.609
And for our schedule!

30:11.969 --> 30:15.390
Wow, this weekend we have a number of streams, but first!

30:16.716 --> 30:22.039
It's been a while, but we'll be doing a Japanese stream!

30:22.459 --> 30:28.843
We'll be doing a game called Make Takoyaki, but there's been a lot of rumors that FUWAMOCO is from Kansai.

30:28.883 --> 30:33.226
We want to prove to everyone if FUWAMOCO is from Kansai or not!

30:38.337 --> 30:41.058
We're going to be playing Tsukute!

30:41.098 --> 30:42.619
Make it Takoyaki!

30:42.859 --> 30:45.280
We're going to be chatting a lot in Japanese.

30:45.340 --> 30:51.003
It's a 3am PT, so it's a little bit early, but not on a schedule.

30:51.023 --> 30:55.125
We're also going to be streaming at 6pm PT as always.

30:55.185 --> 30:57.786
We're going to be playing Thief Simulator 2.

31:00.543 --> 31:01.764
Thief Simulator 2!

31:01.804 --> 31:01.764
2!

31:01.824 --> 31:03.665
2 Thieves!

31:03.705 --> 31:04.926
FUWAMOCO!

31:05.387 --> 31:13.833
And we're gonna be borrowing some Dreamcasts and GameCubes and anything else, you know, that's kind of... Maybe your PSP.

31:15.014 --> 31:15.354
Right.

31:16.275 --> 31:21.238
And then on Sunday, we're gonna be playing Touhou Fujii no Kun!

31:22.159 --> 31:31.502
For the first time together with you, Ruffians, we see just how amazing we are at Touhou as we don't play on Lunatic Mode.

31:33.123 --> 31:34.563
Not Lunatic Mode.

31:34.844 --> 31:36.024
Not Lunatic Mode.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.905
But let's see how much we improve, okay?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.027
BAU BAU!

31:41.407 --> 31:47.732
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning for the 70th episode!

31:47.812 --> 31:49.673
Wow, that's really good.

31:49.874 --> 31:55.158
We're looking forward to many, many more mornings together with you.

31:55.218 --> 32:01.603
Six months of FUWAMOCO Morning, it's gone really fast, and we're sure the next 70 episodes will go really fast too!

32:01.643 --> 32:02.924
How has it gone so fast?

32:03.004 --> 32:03.965
I really don't know.

32:05.366 --> 32:06.647
How have we done this 70 times?

32:06.707 --> 32:07.487
I don't know.

32:08.877 --> 32:09.418
Somehow!

32:09.438 --> 32:12.320
Thank you so much, Moco!

32:12.400 --> 32:13.421
Thank you!

32:13.922 --> 32:20.888
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

This was the 70th episode.

33:04.663 --> 33:07.526
