00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.260
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:05.263
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:09.065
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:10.986
BAU BAU!

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:13.708
BAU BAU!

00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:17.831
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.933
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.614
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:22.954
BAU BAU!

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:33.900
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.643
Thank you for joining us for our 91st episode!

00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:40.804
BAU BAU!

00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:42.705
91, oh my gosh.

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.547
I'm sort of scared.

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.308
I'm sort of scared.

00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:51.890
Moco-chan, by the way, I'm not scared of your froggy voice.

00:05:53.751 --> 00:06:00.598
Moco-chan's not sick, she just has allergies, right?

00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:02.820
It's just allergies, okay?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.343
Have a howl of a BAU BAU!

00:06:06.363 --> 00:06:08.826
Moco-chan's still really really allergenic.

00:06:16.394 --> 00:06:20.403
A witch caught you and put a curse on you.

00:06:29.602 --> 00:06:31.603
Orange is our cheese.

00:06:31.643 --> 00:06:33.004
Orange is our cheese.

00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:34.024
BAU!

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:34.585
BAU BAU!

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:49.052
To explain for any new Ruffians joining us or any Ruffians who are rather forgetful, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:49.912
Hosted by us!

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.814
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:55.134
BAU BAU!

00:06:55.154 --> 00:07:00.796
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:07.499
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.500
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.641
BAU BAU!

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.730
Moco-chan is always cute!

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.950
It's fuzzy.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.731
Just a little fuzzier than normal.

00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:17.571
This is just a limited edition, Moco-chan.

00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:36.794
It's a little fuzzier than normal. This is just a limited edition, Moco-chan. Limited time flavor. Moco-chan's making sure to get a lot of rest. And I'm hoping not to wake Moco-chan by not feeding you natto.

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.649
BAU!

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.591
Moco-chan.

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:50.933
Ruffians.

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:57.279
I think there's been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:01.463
Moco-chan, do you know the secret to that?

00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:03.245
There's no more Pero Sightings.

00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:04.166
Why?

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.748
For the Ruffians to not keep their eyes open.

00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:09.131
They need their eyes open.

00:08:11.114 --> 00:08:15.276
Where did you see Pero this time?

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:20.298
De-den!

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:22.399
That's a surprise.

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:25.520
Pero's sleeping in a coat pocket.

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.522
Pup's kinda happy.

00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:34.408
I don't know, that's really nice of you to let him sleep like that.

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:42.992
Nice, but... Are you sure you're just going to work all day long while he sleeps in your pocket like that?

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:45.953
Like a big lazy bones or something?

00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:50.035
Well, he only has two bones, but... Very lazy bones.

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:51.836
Can you still call him lazy bones?

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:52.776
Yeah.

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:54.137
Lazy bones.

00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:55.617
BAU!

00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:58.079
He's stealing your body warmth.

00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:58.319
Yeah.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:58.639
You know?

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:00.472
That's not good.

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:01.773
Are you okay with that?

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:03.234
Hi!

00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:11.021
He's gonna get all comfy and be like, Oh yeah, this Ruffian is hot!

00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:11.882
No.

00:09:12.082 --> 00:09:12.682
BAU BAU.

00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:16.565
Moco-chan, why is your voice so funny like that?

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:18.847
You sounded just like Pero.

00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:19.848
Hi!

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:20.729
Yeah.

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:21.590
That's strange.

00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:25.502
Are your ears okay?

00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:26.662
Are your throat okay?

00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:27.823
Yeah!

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:29.564
Yeah!

00:09:30.564 --> 00:09:31.265
Like, too good!

00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:35.007
Maybe letting him sleep would be safer, huh?

00:09:35.347 --> 00:09:39.949
You know, if waking up Pero suddenly is anything like waking up Fuwawa... Huh?

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:40.910
Yeah.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.450
Let him sleep, okay?

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:42.631
Huh?

00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:43.591
I don't know why.

00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:44.091
Huh?

00:09:44.111 --> 00:09:47.833
Yeah.

00:09:49.114 --> 00:09:50.735
What are you playing, Moco-chan?

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:52.988
BAU BAU!

00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:58.617
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:59.788 --> 00:10:10.471
Wow, there's been a lot of things going on recently So, we wanted to share some things with you!

00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:20.333
Just the other day, we had a special off-collabs with Koyori-senpai!

00:10:20.513 --> 00:10:22.658
Wow, we had a karaoke stream.

00:10:22.692 --> 00:10:23.092
BAU BAU

00:10:23.672 --> 00:10:30.796
You know we had Koyori-senpai over here as our first special guest on FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:31.736
It was so much fun!

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:36.339
And Ruffians, Koyori-senpai's English was so good too!

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.181
We were seriously impressed!

00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:42.502
Were you just as surprised as we were?

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:44.763
I was so surprised.

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:47.083
But it was a lot of fun!

00:10:47.604 --> 00:10:56.045
After FUWAMOCO Morning, you know, we got to chat a bunch and enjoy pon-de-rings together too!

00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:59.406
And like we said too, we did it.

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:04.487
We tied the win with Mayonnaise!

00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:13.489
Yeah, you know, FUWAMOCO's favorite, pon-de-rings, and Koyori-senpai's favorite, Mayonnaise.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:14.409
Right.

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:14.749
Yeah.

00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:17.666
Do you want to know what the result was?

00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:19.767
Huh?

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:21.108
Huh?

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.390
Oh?

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.351
Not your butt.

00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:29.972
No.

00:11:30.092 --> 00:11:30.492
No.

00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:33.934
When you put me on a pon-de-ring, okay?

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:34.655
No!

00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:37.972
Oh!

00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:40.753
Wow, the result was... Drama?

00:11:40.773 --> 00:11:40.813
No.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.055
No.

00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:47.436
It wasn't delicious, but it wasn't bad.

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:48.157
No.

00:11:48.757 --> 00:11:52.338
Just... Yeah.

00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:55.160
Better without maybe and... Maybe.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.260
It's good.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.341
I would say it was good.

00:11:58.441 --> 00:11:59.802
I couldn't recommend it.

00:12:00.162 --> 00:12:00.522
Yeah.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.203
But it's not the worst thing.

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:02.783
It was just...

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:05.356
Strange.

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:08.318
Thought a lot about it.

00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:09.759
Hard to put into words.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.201
Better than expected.

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:16.282
Maybe.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.203
A little bit less.

00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:22.465
It was sour and sweet but not in a gooey.

00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:28.048
Not even a 4 out of 10, Ruffians.

00:12:28.068 --> 00:12:29.188
2 out of 10, yeah.

00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:30.089
It was just...

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:36.090
I don't even know what coriander is.

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:54.901
I finished my pon-de-ring by putting lots of coriander on top.

00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:56.983
Sprinkle all over the place.

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.477
It was surprisingly really good.

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:18.980
Somehow I worked out.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.460
Yeah.

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:19.801
Yeah.

00:13:19.821 --> 00:13:22.365
I don't really know, it was just good.

00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:24.389
Slancho?

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:25.972
I don't think that's the same.

00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:27.895
It's not the same.

00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:28.756
Yeah.

00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:29.478
Boyander.

00:13:30.197 --> 00:13:30.677
Hi!

00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:31.098
Hi!

00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:31.258
Hi!

00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:52.036
Huh?

00:13:52.096 --> 00:13:53.697
What do you mean I taste buds?

00:13:54.337 --> 00:14:00.960
My Ruffians, if you don't trust FUWAMOCO's taste buds, it's time for you to try it then.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.481
No, it was like a spice.

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.653
It had an interesting result.

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:08.774
Better than Miyo, right?

00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:12.276
It didn't taste like, like, pakuchi.

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:13.376
No.

00:14:13.556 --> 00:14:13.857
No.

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:14.897
It was jive.

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:19.240
But, you know, it was just so nice to be able to talk to Koyori-senpai.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:19.560
Yeah!

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.482
You know, we learned so many things from her!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:27.765
Just, you know, we feel so, so thankful and happy and... Ruffians.

00:14:30.962 --> 00:14:35.646
Oh my goodness, did we ask her so many questions?

00:14:36.247 --> 00:14:37.788
You know what?

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:43.393
We weren't even asking her where she bought her furniture.

00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:47.116
Maybe that's too many questions.

00:14:47.216 --> 00:14:47.736
No.

00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:48.577
Maybe.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:51.740
But clearly Senpai was like, oh, I bought it for BAU BAU.

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:02.491
I don't know, she's probably like... So many questions!

00:15:02.531 --> 00:15:07.393
FUWAMOCO... Well... They're fluffy and fuzzy, it makes sense.

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:08.753
Yeah.

00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:11.854
Yeah, what a kind senpai.

00:15:12.054 --> 00:15:13.355
Exactly right!

00:15:13.915 --> 00:15:19.017
Yeah, but you know, we really really hope that we can have more collabs together soon.

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:25.199
Hopefully sing even more together, especially Moco-chan when you're no longer a froggy like me.

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:31.662
Yeah, but we did just become closer with Koyori-senpai!

00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:38.025
We also got closer to her cat, Chikoyo!

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:47.730
Yeah, you know, Chikoyo's actually really shy and a little bit maybe scared of guests.

00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:49.171
A bit defensive.

00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:54.314
Yeah, so Koyori-senpai said that Chikoyo doesn't really open up to guests and

00:15:54.735 --> 00:15:56.824
Usually just kinda high, but...

00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:00.385
But!

00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:05.828
I think we were the first guests that Chii-Koyo-chan liked so quickly!

00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:09.251
Yeah, we were even able to pet Chii-Koyo-chan!

00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:11.893
We played together a lot!

00:16:11.913 --> 00:16:20.218
Chii-Koyo-chan was purring and being naughty and all cute, wondering, oh, where's Chii-Koyo's pond buildings?

00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:22.079
Hi, where's Chuu?

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.102
We had such a good time together!

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:27.883
You'll be terrified of us, Chuu!

00:16:29.524 --> 00:16:29.804
Hi!

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:30.004
Hi!

00:16:30.344 --> 00:16:30.644
Hi!

00:16:30.664 --> 00:16:30.864
Hi!

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:31.104
Hi!

00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:31.345
Hi!

00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:31.585
Hi!

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:31.785
Hi!

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:31.985
Hi!

00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.650

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:51.790

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:51.890

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:52.070

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.210

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:53.350
Hi!

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:53.710
Hi!

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.330
Hi!

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.510
Hi!

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.570
Hi!

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:55.310
Hi!

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.251
Hi!

00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:57.311
Hi!

00:16:57.891 --> 00:16:59.193
Actually, Moco-chan.

00:16:59.274 --> 00:17:03.180
I didn't tell you, but I found Chikoyo-chan's fur on you today.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.240
Hi.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.467
It was longer than your fur.

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:07.527
Hi.

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:10.071
Oh, that's probably Chikoyo-chan.

00:17:11.693 --> 00:17:12.694
Was I asleep?

00:17:14.195 --> 00:17:15.276
I saw it on your back.

00:17:15.696 --> 00:17:15.977
BAU BAU!

00:17:16.017 --> 00:17:22.282
Maybe it'll be Koyori-senpai's turn next time.

00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:24.063
Maybe.

00:17:24.103 --> 00:17:25.704
We'll have to do even more off-vlogs together.

00:17:35.113 --> 00:17:38.818
But not just a collab with Koyori-senpai.

00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:41.040
But we also did another thing.

00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:42.342
Something new.

00:17:42.983 --> 00:17:44.104
Just the other day.

00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:49.110
And that was Holodorou Kids' Wiki Time Explore!

00:17:49.251 --> 00:17:49.731
BAU BAU!

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:53.633
It was together with those senpai.

00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:58.555
Because maybe it might be a little bit confusing for maybe Ruffians.

00:17:58.975 --> 00:18:00.976
Not too sure, but DOROKE!

00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:04.897
It's sort of like a cops and robbers kind of game in my house.

00:18:05.437 --> 00:18:06.738
And FUWAMOCO!

00:18:06.998 --> 00:18:11.499
We are the robbers trying to escape from hollux with the police.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:13.620
Yeah, we had so much fun!

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.260
Right?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.081
It was great, right?

00:18:16.121 --> 00:18:18.702
We weren't able to stream our practice, but

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:31.531
Actually, when we weren't able to practice a little bit the other night before the event, I was really worried that it wouldn't do well.

00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:37.237
Because you know, I couldn't gather any amazons, and I couldn't do anything.

00:18:37.457 --> 00:18:39.559
It was a bit rough, huh?

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:45.593
Yeah, I didn't expect you to cry a little bit.

00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:48.296
It's not that big of a deal.

00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:49.217
I wanted to help.

00:18:50.768 --> 00:18:51.148
But!

00:18:51.508 --> 00:18:51.888
But!

00:18:52.288 --> 00:18:57.750
For the actual game yesterday, Moco-chan managed to escape both times!

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.790
Both rounds!

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.971
And you were the MVP!

00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:07.052
Everyone's hero!

00:19:07.092 --> 00:19:12.614
I helped everyone escape, you know, by releasing them with the computer from the jail.

00:19:13.094 --> 00:19:14.234
I did my best to help

00:19:14.794 --> 00:19:19.921
Everyone escape and then make it to victory together as a team!

00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:23.005
Fuwawa, I'll take you!

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.647
You got MVP too, right?

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:25.728
I did!

00:19:25.848 --> 00:19:27.510
A different kind of MVP though.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.832
I got...

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:38.570
MOST CAPTURED!

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:44.451
Fuwawa and Aoki, we both got captured the most.

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:49.273
But it's okay though, because Moco-chan, I had you, right?

00:19:49.393 --> 00:19:52.854
And you were able to get me out of jail, too, right?

00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:54.294
I was there, so it's okay.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.502
But we had lots of fun together with our senpai.

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:04.463
I think there was so many really fun and silly moments too.

00:20:04.523 --> 00:20:08.005
So please check it out if you haven't, Ruffians!

00:20:08.045 --> 00:20:14.367
This also marks our very first two POV streams ever!

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:15.628
So we hope that you'll

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:16.589
BAU BAU!

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:57.535
Well, on top of that, just a few hours ago, we were actually live on the official hololive channel together with Nodokaisha as guests on her program, Holo no Kyuujitsu Kakko Kaeri!

00:20:57.675 --> 00:20:58.115
BAU BAU!

00:21:02.914 --> 00:21:07.276
You know, we were really, really happy to be invited to her party and everything.

00:21:07.576 --> 00:21:12.639
I think we were the first hololive English members on Honno Kirititsu.

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:13.760
Right.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.063
But, you know, it was just so much fun getting to chat together.

00:21:19.423 --> 00:21:27.568
And through the whole push-up, we gathered a bunch of different fun things to be able to do together that you wanted to see us do.

00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:28.368
Yeah, you asked!

00:21:28.648 --> 00:21:29.729
Yeah, and, uh,

00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:31.286
Shiritori Drawing.

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.026
But it was fun!

00:22:02.386 --> 00:22:04.648
It was a success!

00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:12.133
There was a BAU BAU speed test, which we won't talk about the results because FUWAMOCO, we won, we won, right?

00:22:12.994 --> 00:22:14.355
No sore puppies here.

00:22:16.076 --> 00:22:20.579
You know, we talked about what it's like moving to Japan.

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:25.783
We got to share Nodoka-san's favorite Japanese food together with us!

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:36.893
Finally, there was a very silly FUWAMOCO attempt at some

00:22:38.368 --> 00:22:40.109
Did I count as an account?

00:22:40.869 --> 00:22:43.570
I don't know, you'll have to check how it went, Ruffians.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.011
I don't know about that.

00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:48.032
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:48.332 --> 00:22:51.253
We went home with many many PONDORINGS!

00:22:51.373 --> 00:22:52.034
Right!

00:22:52.614 --> 00:22:55.055
It was two boxes.

00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:55.975
Right.

00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:58.876
We got to share them with everyone!

00:22:59.117 --> 00:23:01.117
So we didn't go home with two boxes.

00:23:01.357 --> 00:23:03.418
We shared them, okay?

00:23:03.438 --> 00:23:03.918
Yeah.

00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:11.019
It's so nice to talk, but... I don't know.

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:13.501
How do you feel about FUWAMOCO-chan?

00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:15.782
I think it went really well!

00:23:15.842 --> 00:23:16.603
It was fun!

00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:25.270
But I think rather than being on an official stream with Moco-chan, it sort of feels like we just went to a sweets buffet together.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.170
Right!

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.792
We just kept on eating and eating!

00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:30.574
Ruffians!

00:23:30.894 --> 00:23:33.436
What happened to don't feed the dogs?

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.179
Huh?

00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:37.340
BAU BAU.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:45.184
But we're really really really thankful for all the kindness from the staff and their hard work too, you know?

00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:49.666
And, uh, you know there was the ASMR too, Moco-chan.

00:23:49.986 --> 00:23:51.947
How do you think that went?

00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:55.989
There's a lot of happy Ruffians out there!

00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:57.890
And that makes me happy!

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:58.030
But, uh...

00:24:00.626 --> 00:24:01.786
Don't misunderstand.

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:03.007
Misunderstand!

00:24:03.047 --> 00:24:03.547
No!

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:05.848
That wasn't our first ASMR, okay?

00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:08.009
Okay, the first ASMR starts now, Moco-chan!

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.109
Go!

00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:20.299
Moco-chan becomes a dinosaur ASMR?

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:25.183
Yeah, first ASMR, still not quite yet, huh?

00:24:25.643 --> 00:24:29.266
Yeah, I guess that means it's yet to come, huh?

00:24:29.707 --> 00:24:34.791
So, Ruffians, please look forward to it, okay?

00:24:35.792 --> 00:24:38.695
That's the first time we said something like that, huh, Moco-chan?

00:24:39.713 --> 00:24:44.877
BAU BAU!

00:24:44.897 --> 00:24:46.119
But, but, but!

00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:49.021
There was also some big news!

00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:55.046
You know, I keep on talking about this Holo Plus app, but Ruffians maybe are not too familiar with it.

00:24:56.307 --> 00:24:57.408
Wow.

00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:05.454
The big news is that there's a global version of the Holoplus app in development right now!

00:25:05.874 --> 00:25:06.935
Yeah.

00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:16.862
And you know, together with the Holoplus app, you can get all the latest news about your oshimen and hololive as well, and interact with other fans too!

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:21.145
It's in Kool's Beta right now, but please look forward to it.

00:25:21.885 --> 00:25:24.406
More updates from it in the future, okay?

00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:32.890
BAU BAU!

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.490
Hi!

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.971
You know, but Golden Week!

00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:38.692
The holiday week in Japan has just started!

00:25:38.892 --> 00:25:41.193
And, uh, Ruffians!

00:25:42.717 --> 00:25:49.900
Maybe you've been a little bit busy, but have you had a chance to look at our new schedule?

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.241
Because on it, you know, it's really packed.

00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:59.224
There's a lot of exciting things happening, but tomorrow we have a big off-collab.

00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:04.637
We're gonna be doing an off-collab with Marine-Senchou-senpai!

00:26:04.717 --> 00:26:08.299
And we're playing Touhou Mountain Abyss!

00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:12.741
BAU BAU Touhou Fujimoku!

00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:15.442
What are we doing with Moco-chan?

00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:17.663
Marine-Senchou-senpai, is she playing?

00:26:19.614 --> 00:26:20.335
No!

00:26:22.396 --> 00:26:26.439
Well, last time, you know, Moco-chan, you did pretty well playing FUWAMOCO.

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:36.907
We got a bit stuck, but this time, Mari-senchou-senpai, she's going to help mentor us, Moco-chan in particular, until we beat

00:26:38.877 --> 00:26:40.018
Until we get to the end.

00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:42.179
That's crazy, right?

00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:45.440
I'm so nervous, but I'm excited!

00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:50.603
Yeah, Marine-senpai, she's crazy good at doing it.

00:26:50.803 --> 00:26:51.063
I know.

00:26:51.304 --> 00:26:53.565
There's been a lot of times where I'm like, how?

00:26:53.585 --> 00:26:55.466
How is she doing this?

00:26:55.506 --> 00:26:56.726
This is amazing!

00:26:57.046 --> 00:27:01.409
Yeah, we so can't believe we get to do an all-club together at her own place!

00:27:02.939 --> 00:27:05.660
And it's our first collab, you know, in general.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.780
Right.

00:27:07.781 --> 00:27:14.543
We're going to do our best, Ruffians, but who knows how long Moco-chan could take.

00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:19.805
Yeah, we could be there for a long time.

00:27:21.526 --> 00:27:22.226
Ruffians!

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:29.029
Is there anything you want us to ask Marine-senpai or, you know, those kind of things?

00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:35.178
You might have a good amount of time if Moco-chan's not too great at Touhou this time, huh?

00:27:36.038 --> 00:27:37.779
You won't be doing it on purpose, right?

00:27:37.939 --> 00:27:38.659
No!

00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:44.901
Play poorly so you spend more time with Marine-senshu-senpai!

00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:44.961
No!

00:27:45.261 --> 00:27:45.461
No!

00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:46.782
Ruffians!

00:27:49.163 --> 00:27:49.543
Huh?

00:27:52.024 --> 00:27:53.344
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:27:55.105 --> 00:27:58.686
If you were to go to Marine-senshu-senpai's house, what would you do?

00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:00.563
BAU!

00:28:01.352 --> 00:28:01.776
BAU!

00:28:03.966 --> 00:28:04.786
What color?

00:28:05.187 --> 00:28:05.947
What color?

00:28:06.347 --> 00:28:09.648
Color of the bedroom walls.

00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:11.669
Will you sleep together?

00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:12.209
Why?

00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:12.789
Toho?

00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:16.090
I'm pretty sure you need your eyes open when playing Toho.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.950
It's not a sleepover, okay?

00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:20.351
You have to play Toho.

00:28:21.411 --> 00:28:22.832
Ask her to do a Pikachu voice.

00:28:23.032 --> 00:28:23.852
Moco-chan!

00:28:23.892 --> 00:28:25.273
Pikachu voice, please!

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:25.813
Pikachu!

00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:28.113
Actually, that went pretty well.

00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:32.020
Smell her hat!

00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.702
Okay!

00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:35.405
How you wash a hat?

00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:40.951
I don't know, I'll have to ask Marine Senpai how many times she's washed her hat.

00:28:42.537 --> 00:28:45.239
We might put her on the spot, but we can't help it!

00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:46.921
The Ruffians want to know.

00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:46.981
Hi!

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:52.945
Well, there'll be lots of things to do and ask.

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:54.847
Hopefully, Moco-chan, you can clear it.

00:28:54.947 --> 00:28:58.930
Otherwise, maybe we'll be guarding Marine-Senchou-senpai's house from now on, huh?

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.451
Wish me luck!

00:29:00.551 --> 00:29:01.552
Okay!

00:29:01.572 --> 00:29:05.495
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:05.515 --> 00:29:08.638
Playing with an eye patch on.

00:29:08.698 --> 00:29:09.619
The real experience.

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:11.040
Maybe that's the secret.

00:29:13.144 --> 00:29:15.646
Pirate!

00:29:17.868 --> 00:29:19.789
BAU BAU!

00:29:19.969 --> 00:29:22.091
Have a hugfest with Mari!

00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:27.856
It was nice because Koyori-senpai, she give us hugs.

00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:30.798
Moco-chan also hugged me.

00:29:30.998 --> 00:29:34.901
Nice and fluffy, right?

00:29:35.462 --> 00:29:36.602
BAU BAU!

00:29:36.662 --> 00:29:38.344
Maybe we get pirate hugs.

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:40.966
It's up to Mari-senchou-senpai.

00:29:44.709 --> 00:29:53.511
But Ruffians, it's the start of a brand new week, and that means it's time to challenge ourselves to something new!

00:29:53.912 --> 00:30:01.554
Which means, Moco-chan, you're gonna be challenging yourself to some natto!

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:07.015
Ruffians, you remember what natto is by now, right?

00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:09.460
BAU!

00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:13.523
Natto is a common breakfast food in Japan.

00:30:13.864 --> 00:30:17.567
Slimy, stinky, uh, smelly.

00:30:17.587 --> 00:30:18.788
Yeah.

00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:21.330
But it's really good for you and that's why Moco-chan-

00:30:26.674 --> 00:30:28.094
That's right, Moco-chan!

00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:31.515
She's gonna do her best to eat some natto!

00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:36.777
Especially because, you know, Ruffians have been saying natto's really good for your throat and everything, too!

00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.717
Where is it?

00:30:40.157 --> 00:30:40.998
Where is it?

00:30:41.218 --> 00:30:45.439
Oh, it's just right over here, Moco-chan, but... Last week, you remember?

00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:50.680
I was a wonderful big sister, and I ate a natto for you, right?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.480
I can't remember.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.161
So this time, I thought, you know, I got...

00:30:58.174 --> 00:31:00.955
That's why it's in a really big bowl this time.

00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:02.175
Because!

00:31:02.555 --> 00:31:03.496
Ruffians!

00:31:03.936 --> 00:31:07.837
Moco-chan is going to be eating this special kind of natto!

00:31:09.078 --> 00:31:14.840
It's really, uh... It has a bit of a different smell.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.221
The beans are really big.

00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:18.741
Actually, there's about eight of them.

00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:19.882
They're kind of round.

00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:23.357
FUWAMOCO is very nice.

00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:26.839
Moco-chan, do you know what this natto is?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.620
The variety.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:36.184
It's the pon-de-ring variety!

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.765
Extra healthy type.

00:31:39.205 --> 00:31:41.827
Made by the farmers at Mister Donut.

00:31:44.183 --> 00:31:45.083
Yeah.

00:31:45.163 --> 00:31:47.404
It's not because Fuwawa eat all the natto.

00:31:47.444 --> 00:31:48.084
No!

00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.764
Moco-chan!

00:31:49.904 --> 00:31:51.945
I think this will make you feel all better, right?

00:31:52.085 --> 00:31:54.205
I still have one bean left.

00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:55.026
One bean?

00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:56.346
You can't eat it all.

00:31:56.366 --> 00:31:57.946
Just one bean.

00:31:57.966 --> 00:31:58.906
Moco-chan!

00:31:58.966 --> 00:31:59.207
Hai!

00:32:06.334 --> 00:32:07.994
It's a talent so you know.

00:32:08.775 --> 00:32:09.595
Oh no.

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:12.995
My fingers are sticky.

00:32:13.816 --> 00:32:14.736
Oh no.

00:32:14.756 --> 00:32:16.456
It's sticky.

00:32:16.496 --> 00:32:17.716
How does it smell?

00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:22.237
Really good.

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:29.319
What is before you eat?

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:29.879
Don't eat it yet.

00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:33.425
Wait, Moco-chan.

00:32:33.546 --> 00:32:37.707
Before you eat it, let's say thank you to the farmer.

00:32:37.787 --> 00:32:40.988
That miso tofu went really hard to make it.

00:32:41.068 --> 00:32:42.469
And then dip it in the glaze.

00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:45.150
And then package it up.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.071
And make sure it gets to our paws.

00:32:47.251 --> 00:32:50.472
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:32:51.012 --> 00:32:52.233
Say thank you, Moco-chan!

00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:53.173
Say thank you.

00:32:54.674 --> 00:32:55.594
Thank you.

00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:58.715
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:32:59.075 --> 00:32:59.295
BAU!

00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:15.235
BAU BAU!

00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:24.522
BAU BAU!

00:33:25.162 --> 00:33:28.765
Moco-chan, you like that challenge compared to nothing?

00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:30.186
I think that makes sense.

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:35.830
Well... It was a challenge.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.850
A challenge.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.812
I guess you can call anything a challenge.

00:33:39.412 --> 00:33:43.816
You know, maybe something that's really happy one day is harder next day.

00:33:44.516 --> 00:33:45.577
So let's do it again!

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:46.057
No!

00:33:46.077 --> 00:33:48.199
No, next week is not done!

00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:50.161
Next time, okay!

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:53.243
Ruffians, please make sure you know it's a new week!

00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:59.628
Maybe step outside of your comfort zone and try something new and aim for the stars!

00:34:00.088 --> 00:34:01.550
And you'll end up somewhere.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.512
BAU BAU!

00:34:03.532 --> 00:34:06.537
We're cheering for you!

00:34:06.557 --> 00:34:10.903
FUWAMOCO-chan, let's head to our regular corner sound.

00:34:11.043 --> 00:34:17.473
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:34:17.653 --> 00:34:17.874
It's me!

00:34:20.087 --> 00:34:22.589
Stunning eyes!

00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.649
Hi!

00:34:23.029 --> 00:34:25.711
Mia is this Ruffian sister's doggy.

00:34:26.252 --> 00:34:27.553
But super cute.

00:34:27.593 --> 00:34:28.893
Look at my nose.

00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:29.654
Those ears.

00:34:30.154 --> 00:34:30.575
Hi!

00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:32.436
Oh, kinda look what?

00:34:32.456 --> 00:34:33.977
Like my ears, Moco-chan?

00:34:34.537 --> 00:34:36.559
I don't know.

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:38.881
No, actually I feel like this Ruffian's name.

00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:40.181
Oh, great.

00:34:40.462 --> 00:34:42.363
It's sort of fitting for Mia too.

00:34:42.743 --> 00:34:43.424
Oh, yeah.

00:34:44.745 --> 00:34:46.646
Mia kinda looks like a nice couple.

00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:47.707
Oh, great team with

00:34:48.047 --> 00:34:49.948
A bunch of milk in it too.

00:34:50.468 --> 00:34:53.569
But I guess also with zoomies too!

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:56.431
Okay, see you with zoomies.

00:34:56.451 --> 00:35:01.693
Moco-chan, how do we think me about BAUs?

00:35:06.215 --> 00:35:08.075
Let me power up, okay?

00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:09.476
Okay, power up.

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:23.580
BAU BAU!

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.161
BAU BAU!

00:35:24.942 --> 00:35:25.804
BAU BAU!

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:38.617
I hope Mia's BAU BAUs are a bit more contained than that.

00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:43.119
BAU BAU!

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:53.706
Mia's four years old next month, but you know, she's a husky and she's going to zoom around like a husky no matter how many years old she is.

00:35:54.447 --> 00:36:00.050
So I hope that it'll be a good zoomy buddy together with her and play with her lots too.

00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:07.774
Maybe you can throw that ball, and she can chase after it, and then she can throw the ball, and you can chase after it!

00:36:08.594 --> 00:36:09.194
A good buddy.

00:36:09.574 --> 00:36:11.715
BAU BAU!

00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:17.358
And next for today, I went on a walk!

00:36:17.498 --> 00:36:20.179
We have... De-den!

00:36:20.619 --> 00:36:21.700
What?

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.620
A big fish!

00:36:25.196 --> 00:36:27.440
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:36:40.347 --> 00:36:45.434
I love it when you can kind of do that and discover something so cool that you wouldn't see normally.

00:36:45.454 --> 00:36:47.517
But, but, the fish!

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.100
The fish though!

00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:53.345
Please tell me you gave it a little bit of a pat pat too.

00:36:53.405 --> 00:36:57.610
You know, usually it's not okay, but...

00:36:58.584 --> 00:36:59.745
BAU BAU!

00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.887
A peaceful garden and a big fish.

00:37:01.987 --> 00:37:05.690
This sounds like a good balance.

00:37:24.084 --> 00:37:25.505
BAU BAU!

00:37:26.085 --> 00:37:29.106
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:32.428
We have... De-den!

00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:33.588
FUWAMOCO!

00:37:33.849 --> 00:37:37.950
You saw the streams playing Bunny Garden by Pouka and Miko!

00:37:38.451 --> 00:37:39.851
Are you interested in that game?

00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:43.493
FUWAMOCO wa bunny garden ki ni natteru?

00:37:45.034 --> 00:37:47.615
Bunny garden, huh?

00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:50.357
Bunnies are cute!

00:37:51.158 --> 00:37:52.879
Bunny girls are cute!

00:37:57.363 --> 00:38:03.728
I don't know, maybe if they sold us cakes and not drinks instead?

00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:05.610
Maybe, you know?

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.871
If they actually said pyon pyon!

00:38:08.332 --> 00:38:09.593
Or a better yet!

00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:10.794
Nyam nyam!

00:38:11.394 --> 00:38:12.015
Fuwawai.

00:38:17.411 --> 00:38:18.681
Isn't that just Nekopara-chan?

00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:27.672
BAU BAU!

00:38:28.292 --> 00:38:31.174
Playing Twister together does look fun, though.

00:38:34.095 --> 00:38:36.015
BAU BAU!

00:38:36.055 --> 00:38:43.258
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today, for your parasoids, your questions, your walks with doggies.

00:38:43.658 --> 00:38:46.679
And don't forget your FUWAMOCO groups as well.

00:38:46.759 --> 00:38:50.061
Please use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:52.321
We're always waiting, okay, Ruffians?

00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:53.442
So, if something

00:38:53.902 --> 00:39:00.426
If anything cool happens, please let us know and we'd love it if you could be a brand new part of tomorrow!

00:39:01.086 --> 00:39:03.668
Or the next day's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:03.688 --> 00:39:05.729
BAU BAU!

00:39:06.089 --> 00:39:09.131
Well, we have our next stream coming up.

00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:16.755
In a few hours, we're gonna be playing Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:39:16.795 --> 00:39:17.936
We just started playing.

00:39:17.976 --> 00:39:20.157
We're playing on the original hardware.

00:39:20.477 --> 00:39:21.938
It's been a little tough, but...

00:39:22.574 --> 00:39:27.417
Definitely a lot of monkey business going on.

00:39:27.757 --> 00:39:29.418
We hope you'll join us, Ruffians.

00:39:29.478 --> 00:39:34.841
Especially if you could hold our paws, that would be good too because the last boss was hard.

00:39:34.881 --> 00:39:36.262
That was the first boss?

00:39:37.223 --> 00:39:37.883
Second boss?

00:39:37.923 --> 00:39:38.763
Hard for you.

00:39:39.484 --> 00:39:40.164
Not for me.

00:39:40.284 --> 00:39:41.145
We did it together.

00:39:42.737 --> 00:39:44.339
BAU BAU!

00:40:01.194 --> 00:40:01.374
E.T.!

00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:02.796
Did I say 4 p.m.?

00:40:02.816 --> 00:40:03.437
4 a.m.

00:40:03.457 --> 00:40:04.097
P.T.!

00:40:04.538 --> 00:40:05.939
We're gonna be doing our OSU!

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:12.367
collab together with Mari-sensei and Chousen-senpai!

00:40:12.407 --> 00:40:13.488
No shoot!

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:20.476
No shoot when we're gonna end, so maybe, you know, if you're like, I can't wake up at 4 a.m., but maybe I'll wake up at 8 a.m.

00:40:21.457 --> 00:40:24.939
Well, we might still be playing it together with Mari-senchou-senpai.

00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:30.542
I'm hoping because then we can have more fun with Mari-senchou-senpai!

00:40:31.102 --> 00:40:34.264
But it's not gonna be so.

00:40:34.304 --> 00:40:36.645
We have other things you know we're gonna be playing.

00:40:36.966 --> 00:40:40.948
Lethal Company together with Fubuki-senpai and Koyori-senpai.

00:40:41.048 --> 00:40:45.950
Wonderful Company is BAU, but this time, Fuwawa, I'll be playing as well!

00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:48.292
So, it'll be all four of us.

00:40:48.912 --> 00:40:51.174
And then we also have content warning.

00:40:51.194 --> 00:40:56.858
We're going to be making some viral videos together with Haachama-senpai and Poruru-oneechan too!

00:40:56.918 --> 00:41:00.020
Please go out with Haachama-senpai!

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.382
I'm a little bit concerned at the videos we might be making.

00:41:03.402 --> 00:41:05.624
I'm not too sure what to expect.

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.486
You have to join us, Ruffians!

00:41:10.107 --> 00:41:16.110
And then on the weekend, FUWAMOCO's Minecraft journey will be starting as well, so we hope you'll join us.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:22.374
And don't forget, we're also going to be doing some clubhouse games together with Watame-senpai for the first time, too!

00:41:22.875 --> 00:41:25.456
There's so many exciting things!

00:41:25.536 --> 00:41:28.038
And four guys together as usual!

00:41:28.098 --> 00:41:29.399
Doggy Pack!

00:41:29.439 --> 00:41:30.599
The list goes on and on.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:30.840
Oh!

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.802
It was Shiori's birthday, too!

00:41:33.842 --> 00:41:34.242
Yes!

00:41:35.677 --> 00:41:36.337
It's a busy week.

00:41:36.918 --> 00:41:38.959
It's golden week!

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:45.084
But we're really excited so let's have a super fun week, Ruffians!

00:41:45.844 --> 00:41:51.008
And for Ruffians who are joining us through the archive today, we have it!

00:41:51.448 --> 00:41:53.950
Here is your FUWAMOCO'd word!

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.472
It's BAU BAU BATTLE SCREAM!

00:41:56.572 --> 00:41:57.552

00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:04.276

Thank you for joining us today for the 91st episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.901
BAU BAU!

00:42:16.961 --> 00:42:23.644
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:42:24.064 --> 00:42:25.065
Mofukoro!

00:42:25.345 --> 00:42:26.905

00:42:41.731 --> 00:42:42.252

00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:42.772

00:42:43.073 --> 00:42:44.314

00:42:44.654 --> 00:42:46.296

00:42:46.596 --> 00:42:48.398

00:42:48.779 --> 00:42:49.920

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.560

00:42:54.911 --> 00:43:02.981
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:05.924
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:43:06.024 --> 00:43:09.668
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:10.008
