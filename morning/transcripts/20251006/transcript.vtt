00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:21.707
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:26.896
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.683
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:34.449
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.496
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:44.227
And today we're your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.671
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:52.261
Thank you Ruffians for waking up and joining us for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:54.706
Moco-chan, do you know what episode it is today?

00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:56.229
Today!

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.531
It's...

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:00.616
Episode 175!

00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:05.503
BAU BAU!

00:06:05.523 --> 00:06:05.703
BAU BAU!

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:07.426
Do we need confetti for today?

00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:08.628
Yeah, I want a confetti.

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.293
BAU BAU!

00:06:12.313 --> 00:06:12.574
BAU BAU!

00:06:12.594 --> 00:06:14.276
Thank you, all of you!

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:15.458
Why not confetti?

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:16.400
I bought a confetti.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.421
Huh?

00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:18.423
Why not confetti?

00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:23.991
I guess if you bought it, you could have confetti, Moco-chan, but... Let's make sure we have...

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:26.727
Confetti everyday if we want it, okay?

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:29.510
Okay.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:39.259
Well, for those who are joining us for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.501
A.K.A.

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:41.141
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:44.445
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:48.889
Right now, FUWAMOCO Morning will be brought to you temporarily on Mondays.

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:50.991
Today, it's Monday.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.333
Now, so that we can get more balance in our lives!

00:06:54.353 --> 00:07:00.299
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.399
One!

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.805
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:09.789
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.632
BAU BAU!

00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:14.714
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:14.814
Yay!

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:15.115
A new week!

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.956
A new week has started!

00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:19.459
A new day has started!

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:22.876
A new month started a little while ago, Moco-chan.

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:25.402
We can still be sad about it!

00:07:25.422 --> 00:07:26.986
We can still be sad about it!

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:29.432
Do we need to be sad about it?

00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:32.219
Let's look at it positively, Moco-chan.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.482
I'm gonna be sad.

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:37.540
It's already October!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.104
It's already October!

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:41.168
Just like that, Ruffians!

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:42.110
It's already September!

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.393
No, it's Monday.

00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:43.954
Oh!

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:45.577
It's Monday!

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.965
The months are in the double digits!

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:53.935
The months are in the double digits now, Moco-chan.

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.840
That means we're just one step closer to a brand new year!

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.761
Spooky.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.187

BAU

00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:29.075
You want the information right, Ruffians?

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:30.116
That is true.

00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:32.219
We have to think of it logically.

00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:35.544
Not emotionally.

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:36.144
I know.

00:08:36.164 --> 00:08:39.329
You can get a bit emotional when it comes to Pero sightings, right?

00:08:41.472 --> 00:08:44.376
Moco-chan, where was Pero spotted this time?

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:45.638
Let's take a look.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.962
De-den!

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:53.689
You donut!

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.726
Pero ended up eating one of those donuts there and tried to pull a fast one on you, huh?

00:08:59.746 --> 00:08:59.987
Huh?

00:09:00.027 --> 00:09:05.273
Think he's smart, huh?

00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:06.134
No.

00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:10.439
Did he think he could get access to your fridge of yummies and a pudding this way, maybe?

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:10.800
A pudding?

00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:15.986
He's put himself in a dangerous situation now.

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:17.328
That's true.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:17.608
Ruffians!

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.374
How many of you would take a bite out of this donut, huh?

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:23.355
Huh?

00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:25.395
Don't mind if you do!

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.782
Gotta throw away all the donuts now?

00:09:31.623 --> 00:09:32.524
Pero daishiku!

00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:36.169
You make my mistake!

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.115
Donuts are usually boneless.

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.820
Can you imagine a bone-in donut?

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.727
I don't know if you trust it.

00:09:52.807 --> 00:09:55.689
Oh, there's a lot less Ruffians than maybe I thought.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.230
Let's try this.

00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:57.951
Wait.

00:09:58.652 --> 00:09:59.813
We have to get the official.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.814
Official information.

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:02.315
Okay.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:07.539
You don't want to imagine that.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.562
I mean, it's not looking bad, right?

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:11.322
Right?

00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:15.646
I feel like Ruffians, you could take a bite out of this and it'd be okay.

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:16.126
No?

00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:18.288
There you go.

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:20.410
Official.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:23.779
Eat or no?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.621
Eat or no?

00:10:26.142 --> 00:10:27.183
Yes or no?

00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:34.170
Well... I don't know about this.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.431
You could have this one.

00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:36.312
I'm gonna skip it.

00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:38.334
FUWAMOCO, we have the other ones, right?

00:10:38.474 --> 00:10:39.295
There's three of them.

00:10:39.335 --> 00:10:40.877
There's only two of us, so you know.

00:10:40.897 --> 00:10:44.220
You could have one.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.642
Two each, you know?

00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:46.883
Or two together.

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:49.806
And then you still have one and then an awful one.

00:10:51.845 --> 00:10:56.272
Pero- Pero- No, I think Pero would taste like a donut here.

00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:00.298
Well, let's see.

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.342
You would eat him!

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:03.943
Okay, Ruffians.

00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:06.387
Go ahead, you can have a Pero donut.

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:07.789
We'll have the other one.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.011
Yeah.

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:11.314
You- You can have that one.

00:11:11.775 --> 00:11:13.277
And I guess the extra one too.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:17.363
Just a nice week started off by sharing Pero donuts, that's all.

00:11:18.693 --> 00:11:19.674
Interesting.

00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:21.197
I don't know, Ruffians!

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:27.986
Maybe, maybe it's a good idea to throw the Pero looking one out the window.

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.509
Spoiled food goes out.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.994
Yeah, or you could throw it into the garbage disposal.

00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:42.287
That's the sound you would make if you threw it in the garbage disposal.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.044
BAU BAU!

00:11:45.866 --> 00:11:47.209
Compost bin for Pero.

00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:52.402
A nice way to make sure everything gets reused.

00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:53.665
Garbage disposal.

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:56.792
BAU BAU!

00:11:58.737 --> 00:11:59.319
October!

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:00.782
There's a lot of exciting things going on.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:05.628
hololive English Promise!

00:12:10.414 --> 00:12:15.360
They're having their second anniversary!

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.202
They're having a 3D live!

00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:22.769
It's gonna be happening in just a few days on the 8th at 7pm PT.

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:23.530
But look!

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.672
Look at this cute visual here!

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:26.553
What outfits!

00:12:26.573 --> 00:12:28.215
So cool!

00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:29.377
I did notice one thing though.

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:29.757
What?

00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:33.745
Did you see Beisampoi's tail?

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:37.150
Oh yeah.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.315
She has a piercing through it.

00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:41.716
A piercing?

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:42.737
What's the word?

00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:44.599
A clothespin.

00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:49.185
That's not clothing, that's her tail!

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.447
Clothespin through the tail!

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.930
Ouch.

00:12:54.192 --> 00:12:55.373
A safety pin.

00:12:58.137 --> 00:12:59.058
Don't think about it.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:12:59.799
It's okay.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.645
Well, she looks really cool though, so that's what matters, right?

00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:04.366
Forget the pain.

00:13:05.087 --> 00:13:05.227
Yes!

00:13:05.287 --> 00:13:09.634
Look at Kronii-senpai here too!

00:13:09.654 --> 00:13:10.735
I like her sleeves.

00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:10.835
Why?

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:11.496
I'm in the way.

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:14.280
I'm in the way, huh?

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.883
I like IRyS-senpai's braids!

00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:18.807
That's so cute!

00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:21.090
They're like cyberpunk even feeling.

00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:21.987
Maybe?

00:13:22.007 --> 00:13:23.028
I think so.

00:13:23.048 --> 00:13:25.111
Wait, so Bae-senpai has her dice.

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.834
Coney-senpai has a pocket watch.

00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:30.217
Iren-senpai?

00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:31.099
She has a necklace.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.002
She has a necklace, but everyone has a necklace.

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.331
Maybe that will get explained when she has one.

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.252
Maybe?

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:42.774
Rings and crowns?

00:13:42.854 --> 00:13:45.778
She has all the toys.

00:13:46.855 --> 00:14:00.662
I know based on this cute visual, I wonder what kind of live it's gonna be.

00:14:01.064 --> 00:14:07.456
This will be a very cool performance though, so let's look forward to it!

00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:15.230
At 7pm PT, I wish them a big happy 2nd anniversary by calendars while you still can!

00:14:16.092 --> 00:14:18.256
BAU BAU!

00:14:18.276 --> 00:14:18.576
BAU BAU!

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:21.722
Oh YouTube!

00:14:22.816 --> 00:14:26.304
That's where the anniversary live is happening, yeah?

00:14:26.525 --> 00:14:26.846
YouTube!

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:30.133
BAU BAU!

00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:30.795
Exciting.

00:14:31.757 --> 00:14:39.255
And Ruffians, well there's also some more news.

00:14:40.298 --> 00:14:54.115
I wish we didn't have to share these kind of news but it was announced the other day that Hiyodoshi Ao of hololive device week was that she would be graduating from hololive.

00:14:55.717 --> 00:15:03.427
Ao-kun, she had been on hiatus for illness and we know that she was looking forward to returning soon.

00:15:03.547 --> 00:15:07.892
So we were really really surprised when we heard that she'd be graduating.

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.980
We are really looking forward to our return, right?

00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:13.424
Yeah.

00:15:13.444 --> 00:15:17.211
Being able to see all of Riko's solo performance live again!

00:15:17.231 --> 00:15:17.551
Yeah.

00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.463
Yeah, I'll miss her.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:26.648
FUWAMOCO!

00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:30.192
We didn't really get to talk with Ao-kun as much as we wanted to.

00:15:30.813 --> 00:15:33.936
But what we did, you know, we had lots of fun!

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:34.457
Yeah, we had lots of fun!

00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:37.040
You know, we had HologTA!

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.963
And, you know, we ran into Ao-kun at the studio.

00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:42.086
We got to talk a bit at the studio.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:43.427
A little bit.

00:15:43.687 --> 00:15:46.791
Oh yeah, we had fun in the VR chat for, you know, Justice is Halloween.

00:15:47.232 --> 00:15:50.215
Getting all those head pats too!

00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:55.890
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:15:56.231 --> 00:16:00.483
Have a howl of a day!

00:16:00.703 --> 00:16:06.499
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:14.871
We know we girls are gonna be having a big big performance, in-person performance at Ariake coming up in December.

00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:15.231
Yeah!

00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:17.655
So wishing the four of them the best!

00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:24.445
We can't wait to see what kind of amazing, emotional live it's gonna be, so... Yeah.

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:26.427
It will be amazing!

00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:31.254
But she'll be very very missed, so... She's the coolest and the funniest.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:34.579
Very much so.

00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:37.563
Open your Ikemen.

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:40.857
BAU BAU!

00:16:40.878 --> 00:16:43.067
Pick your icon!

00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:47.186
But!

00:16:48.227 --> 00:16:48.708
But!

00:16:48.828 --> 00:16:53.012
Ruffians, there was some more news that all of us were surprised about.

00:16:54.934 --> 00:16:56.696
There was updates!

00:16:56.836 --> 00:16:59.438
There was updates and the updates came all of a sudden.

00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:02.882
All of a sudden and we were like what?

00:17:02.902 --> 00:17:09.248
Ruffians, take a look at this!

00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:09.949
This is FUWAMOCO!

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.471
I'm Nandou!

00:17:11.491 --> 00:17:13.072
It's my color now!

00:17:13.773 --> 00:17:15.775
Look!

00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:20.661
BAU BAU!

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:21.402
BAU BAU!

00:17:21.722 --> 00:17:22.703
They're so cute!

00:17:22.743 --> 00:17:26.767
BAU BAU have all their pictures themselves though!

00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:26.907
Right!

00:17:26.928 --> 00:17:29.891
All the poses they can make!

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:30.551
They're so cute!

00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:34.035
But at first, we were surprised because we're like, look!

00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:36.958
Asahi and Nandroid is coming out!

00:17:36.978 --> 00:17:37.819
It's so cute!

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:38.400
And then we're like,

00:17:39.157 --> 00:17:43.502
Wait, wait, what's next to sighting?

00:17:43.522 --> 00:17:43.762
Oh!

00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:46.365
It's FUWAMOCO!

00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:48.828
That's us!

00:17:48.848 --> 00:17:51.110
Oh, finally, when's the release date?

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.272
We don't know, we'll have to see!

00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:57.397
That's what I'm sure you're curious about and something we're curious about too!

00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:06.468
We will find out maybe sometime in the future and I'm sure it'll be just as surprising as the color versions here are too!

00:18:06.488 --> 00:18:08.590
Look at me!

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:28.131
BAU BAU!

00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:30.516
Yes, it's a big hey hey!

00:18:34.784 --> 00:18:36.548
And Mococo!

00:18:36.568 --> 00:18:36.648
Yes!

00:18:36.668 --> 00:18:45.787
I can't really see them, but our tails... You'll have to get a better look later, huh?

00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:47.570
Are you gonna buy these for Mama Puppy?

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.035
Of course!

00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:58.213
Mama Puppy loves all the merchandise that we send to her too.

00:18:58.593 --> 00:19:01.436
You're not going to touch the tails, okay?

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:01.516
No.

00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:03.178
No.

00:19:03.638 --> 00:19:05.139
I'll tell you, okay, Ruffians?

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:07.342
If you touch the tail, you know what's gonna happen?

00:19:08.643 --> 00:19:12.246
It's gonna feel like plastic.

00:19:13.107 --> 00:19:13.748
It's the truth.

00:19:13.768 --> 00:19:15.149
It's not gonna feel fluffy.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.191
It's not gonna feel fuzzy, okay?

00:19:17.872 --> 00:19:19.093
It's gonna feel like plastic.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.914
Why was I even bothered?

00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:26.822
Why was I looking forward to this?

00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:33.803
That's gonna happen.

00:19:33.823 --> 00:19:33.903
Bye!

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:34.223
We're so happy!

00:19:34.804 --> 00:19:38.991
Who knows when the next updates will come out, but let's look forward to it!

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:39.993
Wish it'll be surprising.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:43.679
I mean, you know, surprises are good surprises, right?

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.806
BAU BAU!

00:19:48.627 --> 00:19:54.497
What was that, Moco-chan?

00:19:54.477 --> 00:20:09.651
It ended already, but yesterday it was Fubuki-senpai's birthday!

00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:11.254
BAU BAU!

00:20:11.274 --> 00:20:19.250
And as a part of the celebrations, there is also Fubuki-senpai had a sweetie Halloween night live!

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.932
Yes!

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:20.793
Birthday live!

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:23.138
But not just that!

00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:25.182
FUWAMOCO!

00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:28.949
We are invited too!

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.350
BAU BAU!

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.234
You can see it in the key visual here.

00:20:31.214 --> 00:20:34.760
Just kind of behind Fubuki-senpai's ear causing mischief.

00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:36.883
Whispering things into it.

00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:42.212
Fubuki-senpai's live was amazing.

00:20:42.914 --> 00:20:45.999
A lot of storybook style stuff and everything.

00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:53.691
But together with her we performed a song called Kyousho Trickstar by All Star Project.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.032
It's super cute!

00:20:54.012 --> 00:20:58.980
It was a lot of fun to be able to perform and sing and dance with FUWAMOCO.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.001
The song is really tricky.

00:21:00.021 --> 00:21:00.803
It's really tricky.

00:21:00.823 --> 00:21:01.544
There's the rhythm.

00:21:01.584 --> 00:21:04.228
I don't think you probably noticed, but the rhythm changes.

00:21:04.248 --> 00:21:04.468
It changes.

00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:08.074
And then... It's a lot of mouthful.

00:21:08.314 --> 00:21:12.020
And there's some interesting English parts too.

00:21:13.803 --> 00:21:16.347
Did you notice the interesting English parts?

00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:17.989
I like my solo.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.775
Yeah.

00:21:21.755 --> 00:21:23.420
Don't stab you!

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.325
I might stab you, Ruffian!

00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:26.769
Give me a cherry pie!

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.514
Soretomo I choke you up?

00:21:29.577 --> 00:21:31.001
Give me a void?

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:36.777
Soretomo I stab you to death?

00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:38.780
BAU BAU!

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.982
Yeah, just normal stuff.

00:21:41.044 --> 00:21:43.908
And it's a very happy, cute, fun song.

00:21:44.289 --> 00:21:48.015
We really like the choreography too.

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:49.317
We get to dance with Fubuki-senpai.

00:21:49.337 --> 00:21:51.100
I like the part where we go up and down.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.986
And then pulling Fubuki-senpai back, forth and back.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.174
Perfectly normal song.

00:22:01.316 --> 00:22:03.439
But we also, we also caught up.

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:10.005
In the recent year, another song of Fubuki-senpai's Hoshizora e to Tsuzuku Sakamichi.

00:22:10.806 --> 00:22:14.469
We did a little bit of narration at the beginning for that too.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.172
I was really happy.

00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:20.374
So if you haven't, please go check it out.

00:22:20.394 --> 00:22:24.338
You can check out Fubuki-senpai's 3D live on her channel.

00:22:24.358 --> 00:22:27.581
She also just released a brand new original song too.

00:22:28.101 --> 00:22:29.823
So please go listen to that.

00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:32.025
The MV is to come out soon.

00:22:32.005 --> 00:22:35.016
Happy Birthday Fubuki Senpai!

00:22:35.517 --> 00:22:41.037
Thank you!

00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:43.259
You watch it!

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:47.466
Go go go go!

00:22:47.927 --> 00:22:51.172
A little bit of a happy announcement.

00:22:51.313 --> 00:22:51.813
Announcement?

00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:53.476
Announcement was update.

00:22:53.877 --> 00:22:54.598
Update.

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:55.159
Too bad.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:57.584
Information.

00:22:57.604 --> 00:23:00.509
I know we talked about it but it was a super chat meeting.

00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:04.315
We mentioned it earlier.

00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:04.696
I can't remember.

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:05.337
But, FUWAMOCO!

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.853
I got to do something fun!

00:23:07.913 --> 00:23:11.059
We went to see a Takarazuka musical!

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.783
BAU BAU!

00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:17.209
We went to the Takarazuka movie!

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.892
Takarazuka kagekidan!

00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:23.059
Have you heard of the BAU BAU Ruffians?

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:23.359
Takarazuka!

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.173
Wow!

00:23:27.634 --> 00:23:28.014
Wow!

00:23:28.055 --> 00:23:28.175
Right!

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:30.779
They had a Castlevania!

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.147
It's not really a stage play, it's a stage play, but it's also a musical.

00:23:35.187 --> 00:23:36.910
Only in passing!

00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:39.836
You've only heard of stage plays!

00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:42.921
So Takarazuka!

00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:46.107
Takarazuka originated in Kansai, but it's not in Tokyo.

00:23:46.087 --> 00:23:57.748
Takarazuka is an all-female troupe singing and dancing with costumes!

00:23:58.049 --> 00:23:59.211
Gorgeous!

00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:00.854
Majestic!

00:24:02.617 --> 00:24:03.299
Amazing!

00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:04.020
Shiny!

00:24:05.162 --> 00:24:06.745
So many lights!

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:08.227
Feathers!

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:10.690
It had an orchestra, live orchestra playing.

00:24:11.692 --> 00:24:17.519
It's sort of similar in... It's not similar, but sort of similar in the sense that, you know, Kabuki is all male.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.240
Yeah.

00:24:19.482 --> 00:24:21.324
But Takarazuka is also really old.

00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:23.427
It's been over a hundred years old.

00:24:23.447 --> 00:24:25.069
I think it's the 111th anniversary.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:28.454
Yeah, that's the sign that's behind Fuwawa there.

00:24:28.474 --> 00:24:28.854
111.

00:24:28.874 --> 00:24:30.376
It's so hard to believe.

00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:31.478
It's amazing.

00:24:31.858 --> 00:24:34.242
But then you went to go see Castlevania, right?

00:24:34.662 --> 00:24:36.124
And then you know there's like

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.582
Morning deshita.

00:24:39.983 --> 00:24:42.886
Morning deshita.

00:24:42.906 --> 00:25:03.269
Morning deshita.

00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:06.533
Morning deshita.

00:25:06.513 --> 00:25:11.001
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:11.341 --> 00:25:19.094
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:19.134 --> 00:25:31.896
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:32.557
Hi.

00:25:32.577 --> 00:25:39.444
But I feel like Takarazuka isn't very well-known over here, so I'd like it to be more well-known.

00:25:39.464 --> 00:25:41.286
I thought, you know, it would be really nice.

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:45.291
I'm sure Elizabeth and Nerissa would really, really enjoy it.

00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:50.817
It's so beautiful and a very special and important part of Japanese culture history.

00:25:51.157 --> 00:25:53.340
So maybe check it out one day if you can.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.325
And then after, because it was half Castlevania and then half Reveal.

00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:01.849
And so we saw the Reveal and it was so cute and so pretty.

00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:04.133
There's one part where they did the cam-cam.

00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:05.655
Yeah, there's Bonnie's.

00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:07.698
Yeah, Bonnie's was really cute.

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:14.749
But I think you know they've been doing more game adaptations recently too.

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:16.592
Ah, I saw it on private!

00:26:16.612 --> 00:26:21.019
So maybe, maybe they'll be doing a game that you'll be proud of in the future too.

00:26:25.445 --> 00:26:27.248
Please check it out, Ruffians, if you're curious!

00:26:27.268 --> 00:26:27.489
It was fun!

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:27.729
It was fun!

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:28.410
I really want to go!

00:26:29.048 --> 00:26:33.612
BAU BAU!

00:26:33.632 --> 00:26:34.093
What was that?

00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:39.077
BAU BAU!

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.879
Were you thinking about the next day's show?

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:41.819
I was.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.304
Because all of you!

00:26:47.324 --> 00:26:48.285
All of you!

00:26:49.627 --> 00:26:52.609
I had... I had a dream!

00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.912
A dream.

00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:59.055
I had how many dreams recently?

00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:00.296
But you have one!

00:27:00.537 --> 00:27:00.997
I do.

00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:03.320
I have this dream with Moco-chan!

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.503
I don't know what it is!

00:27:06.523 --> 00:27:08.466
She said, FUWAMOCO Morning, let's talk about my dream.

00:27:08.486 --> 00:27:09.246
I said, okay.

00:27:10.788 --> 00:27:13.231
So, Ruffians!

00:27:13.872 --> 00:27:16.855
I had a dream Moco-chan was there.

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:18.497
Ruffians, you were there too!

00:27:19.798 --> 00:27:23.002
For some reason, Moco-chan, you decided to buy me a present.

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:24.263
Oh, that's nice of me!

00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:25.064
Alright!

00:27:25.645 --> 00:27:28.468
And, like, you got me... Oh, I remember there's zombies over there.

00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:30.130
What?

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.151
I just remembered that part.

00:27:33.654 --> 00:27:35.457
But let's forget the zombies for now.

00:27:35.537 --> 00:27:36.438
Forget the zombies for now?

00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:38.020
That was the previous part of the dream.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.762
This is the happier part of the dream.

00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:41.084
They were dealt with.

00:27:41.664 --> 00:27:42.305
I don't know how.

00:27:42.325 --> 00:27:49.974
But, Abyss, Moco-chan, you got me a special present.

00:27:49.994 --> 00:27:51.236
Nerissa, what are you dreaming about?

00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:53.198
Are there zombies in your dreams?

00:27:53.218 --> 00:27:54.540
Cue it!

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.463
But, Moco-chan gave me a box.

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:01.246
It was like a, a wooden, like a Japanese wooden style box.

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:02.267
An old one.

00:28:02.287 --> 00:28:02.767
A traditional one.

00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:05.690
Yeah, it wasn't very like, fancy or anything.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.793
Maybe something between Silent Hill F. Maybe that's why.

00:28:09.433 --> 00:28:12.036
But, it was really special.

00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:12.977
Moco-chan, you had one too.

00:28:12.997 --> 00:28:14.518
You're like, I found matching ones!

00:28:14.538 --> 00:28:14.798
So cute!

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:16.360
So that we can open them together.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:16.480
Nice!

00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:19.603
Because, they were really special.

00:28:20.003 --> 00:28:24.527
It had some of the very first Pokemon cards inside of it.

00:28:24.507 --> 00:28:26.931
In traditional Japanese boxes.

00:28:27.113 --> 00:28:28.527
That's how special they are.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:55.623
Inside the box I think there was like decks or something?

00:28:55.643 --> 00:28:56.524
I don't know.

00:28:56.564 --> 00:28:56.684
Decks?

00:28:57.545 --> 00:28:59.847
I don't know.

00:28:59.827 --> 00:29:02.091
Okay, well, 38 cards is okay.

00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:05.177
So the Ruffians and cabbage, you all look together.

00:29:05.217 --> 00:29:12.411
And I got really excited to kind of open some of the sleeves and I could see that some of them were already in, like, you know, the hard sleeves to protect them.

00:29:12.732 --> 00:29:14.956
So that's kind of weird now that I think about it.

00:29:15.357 --> 00:29:17.160
But it's okay because they're holographic.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:43.215
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:29:43.195 --> 00:30:13.202
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:16.767
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:22.093 --> 00:30:32.046
Have a howl of a day!

00:30:32.286 --> 00:30:39.055
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:30:40.334 --> 00:30:41.596
Wait, did the zombies show up?

00:30:42.236 --> 00:30:44.860
The zombies showed up in the previous part of the dream.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.663
That's it?

00:30:51.768 --> 00:30:52.829
I can't really remember.

00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:55.653
I think I beat them together with Moco-chan.

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.298
I feel like somebody else was there.

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:04.924
Maybe it was Nerissa or Elizabeth?

00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:10.181
That was rooms.

00:31:12.546 --> 00:31:13.588
Rooms?

00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:14.971
That's all I can remember.

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:16.936
That's the dream!

00:31:17.397 --> 00:31:20.283
Yeah.

00:31:20.303 --> 00:31:21.626
Yeah, that was the prior part.

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.470
I don't... How do they connect?

00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:27.130
The zombies went away and we opened carts.

00:31:30.574 --> 00:31:32.056
That's how it could explode.

00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:35.800
And then Nerissa and or Elizabeth, was it goodbye?

00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:37.062
I don't want to open carts.

00:31:37.082 --> 00:31:38.784
They disappeared along with the zombies.

00:31:38.804 --> 00:31:40.706
I don't know what that means.

00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:41.867
Did you mean that one?

00:31:43.028 --> 00:31:47.133
I don't know, maybe they didn't mean it.

00:31:47.593 --> 00:31:48.374
What?

00:31:49.896 --> 00:31:50.917
Okay, makes sense.

00:31:50.937 --> 00:31:53.440
That was my GMO feelings.

00:31:54.128 --> 00:31:56.271
I like the printer paper.

00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:59.514
Printer paper coins are very valuable, guys.

00:31:59.574 --> 00:32:05.962
But Ruffians, you were so like... And that's how you knew they were good, because the Ruffians were excited, right?

00:32:06.763 --> 00:32:07.864
Yeah, I was happy.

00:32:08.966 --> 00:32:11.969
BAU BAU!

00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:13.932
You know, just a normal dream.

00:32:14.813 --> 00:32:16.795
It wasn't a very colorful dream, though.

00:32:16.775 --> 00:32:26.387
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:32:26.607 --> 00:32:38.142
Have a howl of a day!

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:42.348
I'm an amateur at it, I don't know how to do it.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.433
I was dropping them everywhere!

00:32:45.593 --> 00:32:47.236
You were dropping them?!

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:52.944
But it's okay because the moment I opened up the cards, like the card pack, they were already in sleeves.

00:32:53.545 --> 00:32:54.527
So it was okay.

00:32:55.608 --> 00:32:56.730
What about the corners?

00:32:57.431 --> 00:32:58.512
No, they were in the sleeves.

00:32:58.533 --> 00:33:01.677
They had like the hard case on them, so it was okay.

00:33:01.717 --> 00:33:03.941
It's okay, they had the protectors, it's okay.

00:33:04.001 --> 00:33:05.563
Some of them did, some of them didn't.

00:33:08.142 --> 00:33:09.704
The ones that matter did, so it's okay.

00:33:13.729 --> 00:33:15.572
BAU BAU!

00:33:15.592 --> 00:33:16.653
That was my dream.

00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:19.637
Yeah.

00:33:19.657 --> 00:33:21.720
Is it a typical Fuwawa dream, Moco-chan?

00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:22.741
No.

00:33:23.282 --> 00:33:25.064
I feel like usually it's more detailed.

00:33:26.746 --> 00:33:31.893
Everything's a little bit fuzzy though, so... Not the weirdest dream.

00:33:32.674 --> 00:33:36.259
It's still a Fuwawa dream, but not that weird, maybe.

00:33:37.623 --> 00:33:38.104
Yeah.

00:33:38.124 --> 00:33:41.868
I didn't tell you about the temperature or the feelings though.

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.110
No.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.430
Yeah.

00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:46.133
BAU BAU!

00:33:47.215 --> 00:33:47.395
FUWAMOCO!

00:33:48.116 --> 00:33:49.197
FUWAMOCO!

00:33:49.217 --> 00:33:49.397
Ruffians!

00:33:49.597 --> 00:33:51.460
Are you excited for this upcoming week?

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.303
Looking forward to having maybe some interesting dreams too!

00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:57.467
Or maybe you're gonna take your dreams and make them reality!

00:33:57.487 --> 00:33:57.567
Huh?

00:33:59.109 --> 00:34:00.070
Are you ready?

00:34:00.691 --> 00:34:02.474
Are you ready?

00:34:02.494 --> 00:34:02.594
Yeah!

00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:03.836
Yeah!

00:34:04.537 --> 00:34:07.883
Well, Moco-chan, maybe you... If you're ready, then I don't need a pup talk.

00:34:08.844 --> 00:34:11.449
I think the Ruffians would like some more encouragement.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.493
I can really make the dream come true then.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.443
Yeah!

00:34:20.463 --> 00:34:20.784
Okay, wow!

00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:22.306
Yeah!

00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:24.049
BAU BAU!

00:34:25.565 --> 00:34:26.987

00:34:27.928 --> 00:34:28.768
Ruffians!

00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:31.031
It's that time again!

00:34:32.432 --> 00:34:35.836
It's time for a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:34:36.817 --> 00:34:43.785
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:44.125
Ruffians!

00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:47.048
It's October!

00:34:47.068 --> 00:34:48.930
Did you know?

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:51.173
Did you realize?

00:34:52.574 --> 00:34:55.217
September was here, and then,

00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:56.592
It's gone!

00:34:57.353 --> 00:34:59.175
It's the next blink of an eye!

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:05.061
And before we know it, it'll be 2026!

00:35:08.244 --> 00:35:10.246
If you think of it that way, you know.

00:35:10.947 --> 00:35:14.751
Isn't it a good time to get a head start on your New Year's resolutions?

00:35:16.293 --> 00:35:18.535
Think about what matters to you in the big picture.

00:35:19.156 --> 00:35:20.177
You know, the long one.

00:35:21.498 --> 00:35:24.141
Are you setting yourself up for happiness?

00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:31.950
In the end of the day, rather than success or popularity or anything, a healthy, happy life is number one, okay?

00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:38.038
So, let's focus on aiming for that and get a head start on 2026!

00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:39.380
Yeah!

00:35:40.061 --> 00:35:41.864
We'll be here to support you, Ruffians!

00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:43.706
BAU BAU!

00:35:43.726 --> 00:35:45.910

BAU BAU!

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:55.704
It's a good time to get a head start.

00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:07.301
Let's do it again!

00:36:07.782 --> 00:36:08.623
Doggy of a day!

00:36:09.548 --> 00:36:20.946
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Pigi!

00:36:20.966 --> 00:36:22.769
Awesome!

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:23.290
Look at those eyes!

00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:26.595
So cute ribbon!

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:47.554
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:36:49.053 --> 00:37:09.508
Pigi is a sweetheart with lots of energy.

00:37:09.488 --> 00:37:13.036
Definitely a proportionate head and body, right Moco-chan?

00:37:13.517 --> 00:37:14.158
Definitely.

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:15.481
Yeah.

00:37:15.501 --> 00:37:18.066
So don't listen to mom being silly, okay?

00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:19.389
Don't think about it.

00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:28.729
Yeah, but um... Pekito, I think she'd maybe appreciate it if you try and take a photo that shows...

00:37:29.435 --> 00:37:31.258
How proportionate everything is, right?

00:37:31.278 --> 00:37:32.800
Yeah, proportion, yeah.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.902
And then that way!

00:37:34.362 --> 00:37:37.587
Mom can't make any jokes, you know.

00:37:37.607 --> 00:37:38.048
Yeah.

00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:38.168
Yeah.

00:37:38.188 --> 00:37:38.368
Right.

00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:39.370
Yeah.

00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:43.135
This dog looks like the FUWAMOCO Nendoroid.

00:37:45.218 --> 00:37:45.278
Hi!

00:37:45.298 --> 00:37:45.358
Hi!

00:37:45.378 --> 00:37:45.859
Don't tell Pigi that.

00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:49.564
Don't tell Pigi that.

00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:51.047
Nendoroids have a pretty big head.

00:37:51.067 --> 00:37:52.329
Moco-chan, can I do the party?

00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:53.350
They're fine.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:02.530
BAU BAU!

00:38:02.999 --> 00:38:04.561
You're cute!

00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:08.446
And next we have... Today I went on a walk.

00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:12.150
We have... De-den!

00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.833
Is this Silent Hill F?

00:38:15.354 --> 00:38:15.714
Moco-chan.

00:38:15.734 --> 00:38:18.958
A night walk.

00:38:18.998 --> 00:38:21.682
You wanted to go look at the stars.

00:38:21.702 --> 00:38:22.823
Very spooky though.

00:38:25.106 --> 00:38:27.969
You're not supposed to go stargazing when there's no moon.

00:38:28.009 --> 00:38:29.791
Did you know that, Moco-chan?

00:38:30.212 --> 00:38:31.133
No.

00:38:31.113 --> 00:38:33.159
Anytime is a good time to go out.

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.689
That's true, but maybe not for stargazing.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.453
Is it because it's scary?

00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:41.081
I think you need the moon to see the stars.

00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:41.522
No.

00:38:41.542 --> 00:38:43.267
Is that how it works?

00:38:43.668 --> 00:38:45.493
If you look really hard, they're there.

00:38:46.688 --> 00:39:16.678
BAU BAU!

00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:20.029
Just a little bit.

00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:22.713
It's beautiful, but... slightly spooky.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:25.977
BAU BAU!

00:39:26.478 --> 00:39:29.182
And next we have our Question of the Day!

00:39:29.803 --> 00:39:33.048
Today's Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:38.957
Have anyone ever mistaken Fuwawa as Mococo or vice versa since you arrived in Japan?

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:43.644
Besides the clip where Kiara mistook Mococo as Fuwawa.

00:39:45.206 --> 00:39:46.969
Well, we can say with confidence

00:39:47.945 --> 00:39:49.528
Other than that, no.

00:39:49.548 --> 00:39:51.832
No, surprisingly, none.

00:39:52.273 --> 00:39:57.643
In style of sound, they're always super duper respectful and nice.

00:39:57.723 --> 00:40:00.989
I've actually really never ever had anything like that happen.

00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:06.599
Stuff like a piece of paper that says FUWAWA being handed to Mococo, but I think that's just normal.

00:40:06.619 --> 00:40:09.264
Oh, that's just being like, you know, oh I made a mistake, fine.

00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:10.206
Yeah.

00:40:10.186 --> 00:40:11.868
That's about it.

00:40:12.529 --> 00:40:12.710
Yeah.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.176
But, you know, if there was a staff member that did make that mistake, we wouldn't say anything.

00:40:17.256 --> 00:40:17.556
No.

00:40:17.717 --> 00:40:19.579
Yeah, we wouldn't want to embarrass them.

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:20.881
I feel like you'd be really sad.

00:40:21.562 --> 00:40:27.010
But, you know... How... How... You know... Only Kiara-senpai.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.632
Only Kiara-senpai.

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.474
She's the only one.

00:40:31.456 --> 00:40:34.540
It's okay, you know, we can... We can, you know, joke with ourselves.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:41.232
But you know, I sure this is because Moco-chan made it very clear that I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:40:41.252 --> 00:40:42.614
And I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:40:42.634 --> 00:40:47.463
And so it's all thanks to our hard work, Moco-chan.

00:40:48.004 --> 00:40:51.169
Up until now, yes.

00:40:53.012 --> 00:40:56.258
It's just KyoAi-senpai.

00:40:56.238 --> 00:41:01.165
BAU BAU!

00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:05.272
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:41:05.292 --> 00:41:10.339
Please remember to send your doggy of the days your questions!

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:11.281
Pero Sightings.

00:41:11.301 --> 00:41:13.364
And your works to us with the hashtag.

00:41:13.725 --> 00:41:16.669
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.916
Very, very important FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:41:21.076 --> 00:41:23.119
We couldn't do this without you, Ruffians.

00:41:23.299 --> 00:41:25.182
So please share it.

00:41:25.162 --> 00:41:26.144
BAU BAU!

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:46.037
We're gonna be continuing to play FUWAMOCO!

00:41:46.157 --> 00:41:48.942
It just started!

00:41:48.922 --> 00:41:54.892
Yeah, Moco-chan, you're playing as the first player of Mario, and I'm playing as two player.

00:41:55.053 --> 00:41:56.215
I'm the co-star.

00:41:56.235 --> 00:41:59.901
Yeah, I think our team together is very strong.

00:41:59.921 --> 00:42:01.143
Very strong.

00:42:02.305 --> 00:42:04.529
We've been having a lot of fun, though.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:05.531
Yeah, the de-sync.

00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:09.097
De-sync here, but not in Mario Galaxy.

00:42:09.337 --> 00:42:10.980
Yeah.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:21.375
We will be playing it tomorrow at 6pm PT, so we hope that you'll join us for some more super fun Mario Galaxy times and cozy story time too.

00:42:23.078 --> 00:42:25.161
BAU BAU!

00:42:25.762 --> 00:42:33.593

Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special roleplayers today!

00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:49.591
