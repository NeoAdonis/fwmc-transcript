04:50.309 --> 04:55.592
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

04:55.972 --> 04:58.253
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

04:58.353 --> 05:00.955
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:07.494 --> 05:10.655
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:10.875 --> 05:12.655
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:12.715 --> 05:15.816
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:16.096 --> 05:21.177
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:21.437 --> 05:22.217
Ruffians!

05:22.317 --> 05:24.158
Good morning!

05:24.558 --> 05:28.559
Thank you for joining us today for our 133rd episode!

05:28.639 --> 05:29.379
BAU BAU!

05:35.853 --> 05:36.654
130 seconds.

05:47.370 --> 05:48.471
One hundred and thirty-two!

05:48.551 --> 05:49.552
BAU BAU!

05:49.672 --> 05:52.055
BAU BAU!

05:52.095 --> 06:00.563
Well well, welcome to... It isn't the 133rd episode of FUWAMOCO Morning, but maybe the first!

06:01.124 --> 06:07.110
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:07.170 --> 06:07.750
A.K.A.

06:07.810 --> 06:08.611
FUWAMOCO!

06:08.631 --> 06:10.393
It's hosted by us!

06:10.953 --> 06:12.515
FUWAMOCO!

06:12.535 --> 06:18.740
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag!

06:22.864 --> 06:24.305

06:24.465 --> 06:28.649
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:28.669 --> 06:29.489
BAU BAU!

06:29.549 --> 06:31.531
Ruffians!

06:35.158 --> 06:37.799
Do you have your coffee already?

06:37.819 --> 06:43.501
Coffee or orange juice?

06:44.041 --> 06:45.742
Sometimes I have many teas.

06:46.262 --> 06:47.282
Appetizer.

06:47.923 --> 06:53.185
I hope that the food that you're making that you're going to eat from here on... Because you're going to have breakfast!

06:53.645 --> 06:56.746
I hope that it makes it onto the plate and not onto the floor.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.535
Good wishes all the way!

07:04.195 --> 07:08.057
Well, if you dropped it, it would be disappointing, right?

07:09.098 --> 07:11.599
Maybe there's something nasty that will help you pick it up?

07:13.180 --> 07:20.764
Well, I feel like this is probably equally as disappointing as dropping your breakfast.

07:20.784 --> 07:22.765
Let's take a look at it.

07:23.726 --> 07:25.687
Another Pero Sighting.

07:30.498 --> 07:31.118
Let's see.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.359
Get it over with.

07:32.899 --> 07:33.339
Yeah.

07:33.399 --> 07:34.879
Then we can pick up the cereal.

07:35.159 --> 07:35.479
Yeah.

07:35.799 --> 07:36.380
Cereal.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.360
Yeah, cause it's on the floor.

07:40.021 --> 07:40.661
Okay!

07:41.621 --> 07:44.302
De-den!

07:45.142 --> 07:45.362
Oh!

07:45.382 --> 07:45.422
Oh!

07:46.142 --> 07:49.123
Oh, from the garbage to the washing machine!

07:49.363 --> 07:50.384
I guess it's a replacement?

07:50.404 --> 07:54.585
I don't know, this is probably what Pero wants, right?

07:56.365 --> 07:58.265
What do you think?

07:58.285 --> 07:58.866
Ruffians!

07:59.886 --> 08:02.746
Do you think we should put him on for a spin?

08:02.766 --> 08:06.047
Yeah, he's getting a spin wash.

08:06.347 --> 08:08.868
Well, that's up to you, Ruffians!

08:09.148 --> 08:10.348
He needs a good wash.

08:10.568 --> 08:11.548
Get the filth off him.

08:11.648 --> 08:14.829
I don't think the washing machine, no washing machine is that good.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.609
Turn it on!

08:15.889 --> 08:16.769
Turn it on!

08:16.829 --> 08:17.269
Turn it on!

08:17.289 --> 08:17.709
Is he stuck?

08:17.969 --> 08:19.790
He looks pretty comfy, but not stuck.

08:19.810 --> 08:20.330
Do it.

08:22.148 --> 08:23.949
Maybe I'll be slightly less nasty.

08:24.009 --> 08:25.791
I'll chew, you know, bubbles.

08:25.811 --> 08:27.952
Bubbles always make everybody happy, right?

08:28.473 --> 08:33.777
He's just going for an intense bubble bath.

08:36.842 --> 08:37.802
Morning!

08:38.263 --> 08:39.843
Everybody likes bubble baths.

08:39.983 --> 08:41.924
I don't know if they like it at this intensity.

08:42.264 --> 08:44.805
Maybe not, but... Yeah, I don't know.

08:44.845 --> 08:48.606
I feel like we should put him in for a spin!

08:48.666 --> 08:48.726
Yes!

08:49.506 --> 08:52.767
You know, cause the garbage compact, it doesn't really work for him.

08:52.807 --> 08:55.648
He just goes... Right.

08:56.308 --> 09:00.409
But... You know, this way it'll make him a little bit less nasty.

09:00.429 --> 09:02.030
At least a little less stinky.

09:05.008 --> 09:11.489
Yeah, but you know Pero, his tongue is really long and nasty, right?

09:12.169 --> 09:20.611
But actually, that would work out well for him in this situation, because because it's so long, he doesn't really need to breathe as much, actually.

09:21.151 --> 09:21.651
Breathe?

09:21.891 --> 09:29.213
Yeah, it's kind of funny, you know, he huffs and puffs a lot, you know, so I think he'd enjoy that.

09:30.413 --> 09:30.753
Yeah.

09:32.606 --> 09:39.088
The only downside though, is that he'll become a nasty wet demon dog.

09:39.128 --> 09:41.889
How is he gonna get all dry again, Ruffians?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.995
I guess that's this Ruffian's duty next time.

10:00.015 --> 10:00.636
Yes!

10:00.836 --> 10:03.658
Well, we hope he doesn't ruin your clothes!

10:03.978 --> 10:04.718
BAU BAU!

10:04.738 --> 10:05.639
Hang dry.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.520
Hang dry.

10:06.660 --> 10:07.841
Oh, you could by his ways.

10:07.861 --> 10:08.901
Lots of different ways.

10:09.282 --> 10:11.323
Oh, by the ears.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.544
BAU BAU!

10:14.005 --> 10:14.845
The dryer, of course.

10:15.146 --> 10:18.268
That's really rude to the dryer, though.

10:19.265 --> 10:20.046
Lots of thoughts.

10:20.407 --> 10:24.091
If I was a writer, I'd be like, I'm quitting my job.

10:25.013 --> 10:27.195
Then you just don't have a title anymore.

10:27.276 --> 10:28.457
It's just a square box.

10:29.078 --> 10:30.119
Square box!

10:30.320 --> 10:30.900
Freebook.

10:31.281 --> 10:31.481
Free.

10:33.161 --> 10:36.523
BAU BAU!

10:36.583 --> 10:42.246
Recently, Ruffians, you know, it seems like there's always something exciting going on.

10:42.946 --> 10:53.411
And just yesterday, our senpai from hololive english prom just had their first anniversary!

10:53.451 --> 10:54.692
BAU BAU!

10:55.472 --> 11:02.613
Already one and a wonderful year since we promised formed all together.

11:02.653 --> 11:07.234
What a big congratulations!

11:07.274 --> 11:09.615
But they celebrated of course all together.

11:10.335 --> 11:16.876
Looking over past memories and getting up to all kinds of silliness, you know.

11:16.916 --> 11:20.597
Yeah, and you know they also announced some wonderful anniversary merch.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.998
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.379
Have a howl of a day!

11:25.419 --> 11:26.940
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.001
Have a howl of a day!

11:44.549 --> 11:47.570
They are now up in upcoming 3D Promise Musical!

11:47.590 --> 11:47.690

12:09.892 --> 12:10.893
3D musical?

12:10.933 --> 12:11.774
Oh my gosh.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.455
What do you think it could be, Ruffians?

12:13.515 --> 12:28.368
I just imagine like... I'm imagining cruelty senpai like... Stomping Bae-senpai through the chest with one of her legs and then Bae-senpai falling to the ground so dramatically and then doing a beautiful dance on the ground and then getting home.

12:28.388 --> 12:29.129
Kind of like Utena.

12:31.434 --> 12:32.695
Is this a musical?

12:33.175 --> 12:35.556
Of course, they're singing at the same time too.

12:35.596 --> 12:37.838
Maybe Senpai gets stomped to the chest.

12:38.258 --> 12:38.658
Yeah.

12:38.678 --> 12:39.959
Maybe Senpai's leg.

12:40.039 --> 12:42.581
Like she's stomped to the chest with a leg.

12:45.670 --> 12:47.311
I thought they sing in musicals.

12:47.671 --> 12:50.613
They do violent things sometimes too, especially in the theater.

12:50.633 --> 12:51.673
You hope it's a comedy?

12:51.753 --> 12:53.114
I hope it's a comedy too!

12:53.134 --> 12:53.494
Yeah!

12:53.574 --> 12:55.055
I hope it won't!

12:55.135 --> 12:55.695
No!

12:55.755 --> 12:56.816
In theater, you know!

12:56.856 --> 12:57.396
Yeah!

12:57.516 --> 12:58.597
December 24th.

12:58.657 --> 12:58.937
I know!

12:59.017 --> 13:00.158
I love BAU BAU!

13:00.218 --> 13:01.619
BAU BAU!

13:02.119 --> 13:04.460
I love you, Chachi!

13:04.500 --> 13:05.181
BAU BAU!

13:05.261 --> 13:07.322
We were just talking about Starbeam's...

13:08.772 --> 13:11.915
Good morning!

13:11.995 --> 13:12.916
BAU BAU!

13:13.096 --> 13:18.501
But you know, it's gonna be a disappointment.

13:18.901 --> 13:21.644
It's hard to wait, I wanna see it now!

13:21.764 --> 13:23.906
I need to know which subplot gets dubbed.

13:24.466 --> 13:28.950
I don't know, maybe I'm thinking of something more like Shakespeare.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.952
Is that a musical?

13:31.092 --> 13:34.295
I don't know, I'm not well versed in these kind of things I guess.

13:36.953 --> 13:38.193
We'll have to see!

13:38.233 --> 13:42.455
Yeah, but you know, we've seen some of Aki-senpai's musicals.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.396
And it's such a cool concept!

13:44.416 --> 13:46.656
You know, FUWAMOCO, we want to do one too!

13:46.676 --> 13:47.077
Yeah!

13:47.097 --> 13:50.258
It's on our Goals and Dreams list for debut!

13:50.358 --> 13:50.538
Yeah!

13:51.138 --> 13:52.478
But I don't know, I'm excited.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.679
I want to know what the theme will be!

13:54.759 --> 13:56.660
Maybe the theme will be... Drama!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.240
The Broken Promise?

14:00.021 --> 14:02.962
Broken Promise!

14:03.102 --> 14:05.263
It says right there, The Broken Promise.

14:08.725 --> 14:09.166
BAU BAU!

14:09.186 --> 14:15.451
Nerissa's gonna be really excited.

14:15.531 --> 14:16.572
We're all excited!

14:38.847 --> 14:39.527
BAU BAU!

14:57.511 --> 14:59.773
Suisei-senpai!

14:59.833 --> 15:00.134
Yeah!

15:00.174 --> 15:08.783
Suisei-senpai was on a TV show in Japan announcing the most popular songs of the now.

15:09.223 --> 15:12.947
And not only was she just like, "oh, Hoshimachi Suisei, this is her song."

15:13.007 --> 15:14.950
She was there to perform!

15:15.190 --> 15:16.071
Yeah!

15:16.151 --> 15:17.132
BAU BAU!

15:17.272 --> 15:17.612
It was so cool!

15:17.632 --> 15:18.173
It was so cool!

15:18.193 --> 15:18.593
It was so cool!

15:18.613 --> 15:18.953
It was so cool!

15:18.973 --> 15:19.293
It was so cool!

15:19.313 --> 15:19.874
It was so cool!

15:19.994 --> 15:20.654
It was so cool!

15:20.674 --> 15:21.135
It was so cool!

15:21.155 --> 15:21.715
It was so cool!

15:21.735 --> 15:22.135
It was so cool!

15:22.195 --> 15:22.636
It was so cool!

15:22.676 --> 15:23.456
It was so cool!

15:23.476 --> 15:23.957
It was so cool!

15:24.057 --> 15:24.457
It was so cool!

15:24.497 --> 15:24.917
It was so cool!

15:24.937 --> 15:25.358
It was so cool!

15:25.398 --> 15:26.038
It was so cool!

15:26.098 --> 15:27.019
It was so cool!

15:27.039 --> 15:27.539
It was so cool!

15:27.619 --> 15:27.959
It was so cool!

15:28.019 --> 15:28.600
It was so cool!

15:28.620 --> 15:29.040
It was so cool!

15:29.060 --> 15:29.400
It was so cool!

15:29.420 --> 15:29.781
It was so cool!

15:29.801 --> 15:30.661
It was so cool!

15:30.681 --> 15:31.402
It was so cool!

15:31.422 --> 15:31.862
It was so cool!

15:31.882 --> 15:32.282
It was so cool!

15:32.322 --> 15:32.763
It was so cool!

15:32.783 --> 15:33.143
It was so cool!

15:33.463 --> 15:33.903
It was so cool!

15:33.923 --> 15:34.404
It was so cool!

15:34.424 --> 15:35.024
It was so cool!

15:35.044 --> 15:35.645
It was so cool!

15:35.665 --> 15:36.085
It was so cool!

15:36.105 --> 15:36.445
It was so cool!

15:36.465 --> 15:36.866
It was so cool!

15:36.906 --> 15:37.486
It was so cool!

15:37.506 --> 15:38.186
It was so cool!

15:38.246 --> 15:38.767
It was so cool!

15:38.787 --> 15:39.527
It was so cool!

15:39.547 --> 15:40.428
It was so cool!

15:40.448 --> 15:40.868
It was so cool!

15:40.948 --> 15:41.429
It was so cool!

15:41.449 --> 15:41.889
It was so cool

15:43.799 --> 15:44.480
We watched it!

15:44.560 --> 15:45.200
We watched it!

15:45.260 --> 15:46.201
We watched it!

15:46.261 --> 15:47.762
Yeah!

15:47.982 --> 15:49.764
Suisei-san was there!

15:49.944 --> 15:51.926
It was an amazing performance.

15:51.946 --> 15:57.190
She performed BIBBIDIBA first and then her brand new song by Natori.

15:57.450 --> 16:00.092
Oh my, I still have it stuck in my head.

16:00.112 --> 16:04.295
And you know all the other performers there, all the other idols that I've seen.

16:04.335 --> 16:05.556
Yeah, I saw Suisei-san!

16:05.937 --> 16:07.898
Oh my gosh!

16:07.918 --> 16:10.200
The penlights and everything!

16:10.260 --> 16:10.721
It was so cool.

16:11.654 --> 16:23.722
Why, you know, seeing, you know, Suisei-senpai doing such amazing things, it really makes us want to work really hard so that maybe one day we can become big senpai too.

16:23.802 --> 16:24.903
Although we definitely can't be.

16:24.943 --> 16:25.543
Not like that, but.

16:25.703 --> 16:26.284
We can't be.

16:26.384 --> 16:30.086
I just, I just want to be amazing and talented as Suisei-senpai.

16:30.407 --> 16:35.910
But we will do our best to become as fluffy and fuzzy, you know, the FUWAMOCO way.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.091
Yes, so.

16:37.111 --> 16:38.212
I think.

16:39.223 --> 16:44.387
We ate cake with one and then we all danced Bibbidi-bob and I had a fork in my hand.

16:44.407 --> 16:50.812
Deshita!

16:50.832 --> 16:57.057
But maybe one day Moco-chan you won't have a fork in your hand, you'll have a mic in your hand.

16:57.117 --> 16:57.878
Yeah!

16:57.958 --> 16:58.418
When?

16:58.578 --> 16:59.079
When?

16:59.159 --> 17:06.925
We ate cake and we danced Bibbidi-bob and I had a fork in my hand.

17:08.949 --> 17:12.512
I wonder maybe if you have a microphone.

17:12.552 --> 17:12.732
Yeah.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.533
I don't have anything.

17:14.674 --> 17:16.755
I had a fork in my hand.

17:16.775 --> 17:19.137
Moco-chan, I have to ask.

17:19.177 --> 17:21.859
Did you say... What?

17:22.239 --> 17:24.801
You said we danced a bibidi-ba.

17:25.662 --> 17:26.483
Did I?

17:26.863 --> 17:28.704
I said we danced bibidi-ba.

17:28.804 --> 17:32.848
Ruffians, let's all do a nice bibidi-ba all together, okay?

17:36.851 --> 17:37.311
BAU BAU!

17:37.391 --> 17:40.655
FUWAMOCO Congratulations!

17:40.695 --> 17:41.035
BAU BAU!

17:41.075 --> 17:42.116
BAU BAU!

17:56.630 --> 18:01.474
Well, the last time, Ruffians, we shared with you some big news!

18:01.494 --> 18:06.739
Big news that we ordered our received balls!

18:07.019 --> 18:15.606
But there was actually a good reason because we had a little bit of motivation to order something else and then we figured that we should order balls.

18:15.626 --> 18:17.948
So we did.

18:18.829 --> 18:22.712
Ruffians, can you guess what maybe FUWAMOCO decided to order?

18:27.253 --> 18:30.974
But give us some motivation to do that!

18:31.794 --> 18:32.554
Cats!

18:32.734 --> 18:38.715
That would be accurate if you could order cats anime figures!

18:40.035 --> 18:45.777
We did it!

18:46.717 --> 18:47.277
We did it!

18:47.617 --> 18:47.817
Oops!

18:48.177 --> 18:51.618
We ordered some figures, but it was for the very good reason!

18:51.678 --> 18:52.918
For the first time!

18:54.050 --> 18:56.051
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

18:56.611 --> 19:00.013
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

19:16.226 --> 19:23.430
I think it was just released recently so we have to get it right now!

19:23.910 --> 19:27.732
And so we got Poruru onee-chan's denjouen.

19:28.012 --> 19:31.234
Moco-chan, you're playing with it as we have breakfast.

19:32.414 --> 19:33.695
What pose should I do?

19:33.835 --> 19:36.996
What heart should I put in?

19:37.577 --> 19:41.579
And not just that, we got Fubuki's denjouen!

19:44.149 --> 19:46.430
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

20:11.512 --> 20:14.553
Do you have display shelves?

20:15.013 --> 20:16.033
Not in the slightest.

20:16.753 --> 20:17.373
Any shelves.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.554
No shelves.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.494
There's no place to put them.

20:24.935 --> 20:29.116
Figures first, shelves later.

20:30.196 --> 20:35.777
And then we also got another have a good smile figure of a certain cat.

20:37.141 --> 20:41.842
MCC has another friend, but the friend was out of stock.

20:42.443 --> 20:47.244
And also, Hobuki-senpai's friends with this other cat.

20:48.024 --> 20:56.666
And it kind of looks like a... Maybe that cat's usual friend got replaced and now it's kind of an interesting friendship.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.307
Yeah, yeah.

20:59.617 --> 21:01.440
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.702
Have a howl of a day!

21:02.742 --> 21:05.085
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:05.145 --> 21:07.328
Have a howl of a day!

21:15.900 --> 21:24.065
We are very happy that we are able to welcome Ai-senpai and speakers into our doghouse!

21:24.305 --> 21:25.746
BAU BAU!

21:25.766 --> 21:28.267
They said that we got wolf.

21:28.528 --> 21:30.389
And Ruffians!

21:30.549 --> 21:31.770
And Ruffians too.

21:32.590 --> 21:35.292
BAU BAU!

21:35.992 --> 21:36.893
BAU BAU!

21:38.814 --> 21:40.695
Yeah, you know the true story, Ruffians.

21:41.859 --> 21:45.741
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:46.281 --> 21:52.104
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:52.184 --> 21:54.546
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

22:05.311 --> 22:06.672
Tofu bar?

22:06.792 --> 22:08.573
Brown tofu bar.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.214
What the heck is this?

22:11.474 --> 22:12.315
Is it okay?

22:12.335 --> 22:16.157
I was like, what am I looking at here?

22:16.637 --> 22:19.058
Is this supposed to be with the rest of the tofu bars?

22:20.699 --> 22:22.360
Black tofu, that's what you would think.

22:22.380 --> 22:27.583
I thought maybe it was like, ah, squid related, squid ink.

22:27.603 --> 22:28.683
Shokuban no.

22:29.123 --> 22:29.644
No.

22:31.245 --> 22:31.605
It was...

22:32.963 --> 22:36.725
Dessert actually!

22:37.185 --> 22:40.047
Tofu choco... What's the word?

22:40.287 --> 22:41.247
Gato.

22:41.967 --> 22:42.448
What?

22:42.808 --> 22:43.628
Anymore!

22:43.668 --> 22:46.130
FUWAMOCO!

22:46.510 --> 22:48.211
Don't really like chocolate.

22:49.771 --> 22:54.093
But I just thought we had to try it because it looks so silly.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.714
Yeah.

22:56.755 --> 22:57.135
Ew.

22:58.175 --> 22:58.415
Ew.

22:58.576 --> 22:59.076
Was it ew?

23:00.142 --> 23:01.104
Wasn't you at all?

23:01.244 --> 23:05.551
Actually, it doesn't taste a thing like tofu.

23:05.711 --> 23:07.454
I've been too scared, I haven't tried it.

23:07.594 --> 23:11.961
It's very chocolatey, so it's like a... I feel like you should heat it up.

23:12.081 --> 23:12.121
No.

23:12.181 --> 23:12.382
No.

23:14.283 --> 23:16.464
That might make the tofu flavor come out.

23:16.944 --> 23:24.046
I felt like for the gato chocolate name, I was like, this is that.

23:24.426 --> 23:26.406
This is the French chocolate.

23:27.286 --> 23:29.327
Yeah, like French for cake, I guess.

23:30.467 --> 23:32.908
What kind of cake texture?

23:32.988 --> 23:34.528
It was like a tofu.

23:34.768 --> 23:35.529
No!

23:35.589 --> 23:36.549
No tofu!

23:36.649 --> 23:38.429
It was just like a cake.

23:38.829 --> 23:39.570
A chocolate cake.

23:39.670 --> 23:40.670
A very chocolatey cake.

23:41.816 --> 23:42.516
Like a bunch.

23:42.876 --> 23:43.697
It's not cake.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.858
It's tofu.

23:49.739 --> 23:51.020
Tofu bar da yo.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.240
Chocolate's not good for dogs.

23:53.541 --> 23:54.341
Ruffians!

23:54.441 --> 23:55.421
We're not dogs!

23:55.781 --> 23:56.882
We're demon dogs!

23:57.022 --> 24:00.063
How many times do we have to go over this?

24:00.523 --> 24:04.645
FUWAMOCO, we just don't really like chocolate.

24:04.665 --> 24:05.605
We can't eat it.

24:06.105 --> 24:09.827
If it tastes really chocolatey, it tastes really bad.

24:12.143 --> 24:16.204
It was like... I'm just being silly.

24:17.965 --> 24:18.805
Okay.

24:20.886 --> 24:24.146
But it was a new discovery for sure.

24:24.507 --> 24:28.728
I didn't know tofu could go to this kind of new level.

24:29.428 --> 24:30.848
A new tofu world.

24:31.108 --> 24:32.949
They are beautiful.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.473
BAU BAU!

24:35.533 --> 24:39.296
If you see Ruffians, please give it a try.

24:39.356 --> 24:41.397
It's definitely a new discovery.

24:42.177 --> 24:44.779
BAU BAU!

24:45.740 --> 24:46.320
Konbini?

24:46.580 --> 24:47.661
Konbini uteru?

24:47.701 --> 24:50.723
Konbini moshikashite aru kamoshirenai.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.006
BAU BAU!

24:56.707 --> 24:58.067
Ruffians!

24:59.275 --> 25:00.396
It's the middle of the week.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.897
How are you doing?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.458
Are you doing okay?

25:03.498 --> 25:07.281
Do you need a little bit more head pats than usual?

25:08.121 --> 25:09.182
Whatever we need.

25:10.062 --> 25:12.804
Moco-chan puts out this and all the time for that, Moco-chan.

25:15.246 --> 25:15.666
Yeah.

25:16.527 --> 25:17.287
You doing your best?

25:17.307 --> 25:18.368
You need a boost?

25:19.089 --> 25:24.332
Well, when you need a boost, sometimes a little bit of a Pup Talk helps.

25:25.873 --> 25:26.093
Oh!

25:26.614 --> 25:26.914
Wow.

25:31.666 --> 25:33.348
BAU BAU!

25:34.208 --> 25:35.189
Ruffians!

25:37.751 --> 25:43.456
Do you know what day of the week it is?

25:45.218 --> 25:45.959
Go on!

25:45.999 --> 25:48.301
That's pretty good you know.

25:48.321 --> 25:52.024
Pup Talk Day!

25:52.544 --> 25:53.625
Pup Talk Day!

25:53.685 --> 25:54.066
I say yes!

25:55.665 --> 25:56.726
FUWAMOCO!

25:57.126 --> 26:00.268
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

26:00.928 --> 26:06.032
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

26:07.933 --> 26:08.513
Ruffians.

26:10.134 --> 26:11.235
How has the week been?

26:13.817 --> 26:14.137
Good?

26:15.478 --> 26:17.319
A little bit rough?

26:19.501 --> 26:19.841
No.

26:20.541 --> 26:22.442
Sometimes things are like that.

26:23.664 --> 26:29.105
I know you do your best, but sometimes things just won't go your way no matter how hard you try.

26:30.285 --> 26:31.246
It's just how it is.

26:32.086 --> 26:36.107
You know, no matter your best efforts, it can't be helped.

26:37.447 --> 26:42.288
Sometimes the best thing to do is to just accept that.

26:42.988 --> 26:44.749
But that's all you can do.

26:45.569 --> 26:47.609
You can't do anything about the current results.

26:47.969 --> 26:50.990
You just have to keep on moving forward and trying your best, okay?

26:52.173 --> 26:53.034
Don't get disturbed.

26:53.214 --> 26:53.875
Disturbed?

26:55.537 --> 26:56.879
Don't get discouraged!

26:57.139 --> 26:57.680
Okay!

26:58.441 --> 26:59.262
You can do it!

26:59.883 --> 27:00.463
I know you can.

27:02.193 --> 27:03.574
Ganbatte desh!

27:03.634 --> 27:06.376
Let's do our best!

27:06.436 --> 27:08.517
BAU BAU!

27:08.597 --> 27:10.378
BAU BAU!

27:10.438 --> 27:13.600
You know, sometimes things just don't go the right way.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.641
And it's best just to laugh.

27:16.061 --> 27:17.922
Got it!

27:19.023 --> 27:24.827
So, Ruffians, during those times, just remember FUWAMOCO's there, laughing together with you.

27:25.647 --> 27:27.169
We have been doing something a lot lately.

27:27.189 --> 27:27.769
FUWAMOCO.

27:28.129 --> 27:29.751
Just keep watching on exactly!

27:29.771 --> 27:30.111
FUWAMOCO!

27:30.151 --> 27:30.472
FUWAMOCO!

27:30.532 --> 27:31.012
FUWAMOCO!

27:31.253 --> 27:31.913
FUWAMOCO!

27:31.973 --> 27:33.435
FUWAMOCO!

27:33.455 --> 27:33.755
FUWAMOCO!

27:34.216 --> 27:34.716
FUWAMOCO!

27:34.736 --> 27:35.036
FUWAMOCO!

27:35.056 --> 27:35.357
FUWAMOCO!

27:35.397 --> 27:35.577
FUWAMOCO!

27:35.617 --> 27:35.937
FUWAMOCO!

27:35.957 --> 27:36.218
FUWAMOCO!

27:36.258 --> 27:36.538
FUWAMOCO!

27:36.558 --> 27:36.758
FUWAMOCO!

27:36.798 --> 27:37.159
FUWAMOCO!

27:37.179 --> 27:37.859
FUWAMOCO!

27:37.919 --> 27:39.100
FUWAMOCO!

27:39.120 --> 27:39.821
FUWAMOCO!

27:39.901 --> 27:40.202
FUWAMOCO!

27:40.322 --> 27:40.642
FUWAMOCO!

27:40.662 --> 27:41.062
FUWAMOCO!

27:41.082 --> 27:41.923
FUWAMOCO!

27:41.943 --> 27:43.485
FUWAMOCO!

27:43.505 --> 27:44.366
FUWAMOCO!

27:44.626 --> 27:45.787
FUWAMOCO!

27:45.807 --> 27:45.967
FUWAMOCO!

27:45.987 --> 27:46.208
FUWAMOCO!

27:46.228 --> 27:47.068
FUWAMOCO!

27:47.088 --> 27:47.509
FUWAMOCO

27:48.013 --> 27:49.634
FUWAMOCO!

27:49.674 --> 27:50.815
FUWAMOCO!

27:50.855 --> 27:51.675
FUWAMOCO!

27:51.715 --> 27:52.415
FUWAMOCO!

28:10.966 --> 28:13.247
Ruffians, look at where you're sticking.

28:13.367 --> 28:16.269
There are lots of gentle head parts, right?

28:16.329 --> 28:16.929
Gentle.

28:17.370 --> 28:17.850
Gentle.

28:17.910 --> 28:19.451
Just for now, okay?

28:19.891 --> 28:20.091
Okay!

28:20.391 --> 28:22.052
The other corner should know it.

28:22.472 --> 28:24.794
It's the one of braveness.

28:24.974 --> 28:25.694
Braveness.

28:26.335 --> 28:27.936
And... Excitement.

28:28.396 --> 28:29.276
What's to come.

28:29.557 --> 28:34.780
Because she's gonna be riding circles all around the place very soon.

28:34.860 --> 28:35.160
Yeah.

28:36.402 --> 28:49.775
That echoes the corn.

28:50.856 --> 28:55.081
That's the echo in the corn!

28:55.741 --> 28:56.763
It's the corn, you know.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.905
The corn kind of makes everything a little bit more...

29:03.320 --> 29:06.441
That dog sounded just like her little son.

29:08.601 --> 29:15.922
Well, you know, she's super sweet, but she's a little bit down, so she has to wear this silly cone.

29:16.162 --> 29:19.663
You know, head pads, it's a little bit harder to get them.

29:21.703 --> 29:27.504
But despite everything, she's still ready to listen to what's all been bugging you.

29:28.204 --> 29:32.465
She wants to cuddle, even though there's a big cone getting in the way.

29:33.957 --> 29:39.019
Yeah, she would like to ask for a bite or two from your plate though.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.191
I would recommend supporting this.

29:46.731 --> 29:49.554
BAU BAU!

29:49.574 --> 29:53.057
Let's take a look, Ruffians!

29:53.137 --> 29:55.118
It's getting so nice and cool.

29:55.599 --> 29:57.440
Beautiful and crisp.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.622
Let's see what kind of walks we've been going on.

29:59.902 --> 30:02.024
Today I went on a walk.

30:02.724 --> 30:06.047
De-den!

30:06.588 --> 30:07.048
Ducks!

30:07.608 --> 30:08.069
Ducks!

30:10.441 --> 30:11.882
FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:28.470 --> 30:29.370
Right in the line.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.531
Right in the center.

30:30.731 --> 30:31.191
Right.

30:31.471 --> 30:32.252
Is that just us?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.633
Do you feel that way, Ruffians?

30:34.693 --> 30:34.833
Shoes.

30:34.873 --> 30:35.833
They look like shoes.

30:36.274 --> 30:37.134
Shiba shoes!

30:37.694 --> 30:38.555
Shiba shiba shoes!

30:38.575 --> 30:40.676
They just took off their shoe and left it there.

30:40.736 --> 30:41.156
Right.

30:41.316 --> 30:43.117
They just like, jumped in the water.

30:43.217 --> 30:43.517
Yeah!

30:43.877 --> 30:44.677
Free shoe!

30:44.717 --> 30:45.258
Yeah!

30:45.978 --> 30:47.079
Look at the shoe!

30:47.439 --> 30:47.939
Yeah.

30:48.119 --> 30:48.439
What?

30:48.939 --> 30:51.180
Why are you making those faces, Ruffians?

30:51.220 --> 30:52.341
This is normal.

30:52.421 --> 30:53.401
It's normal.

30:53.661 --> 30:54.282
Yeah.

30:56.341 --> 30:59.944
They're very cute.

30:59.964 --> 31:02.646
The water looks so nice and cool.

31:02.786 --> 31:05.208
Now I'm just wondering what it'd be like to be a dog.

31:05.268 --> 31:08.051
I have to ask Zubaru-senpai.

31:10.374 --> 31:14.316
BAU BAU!

31:14.436 --> 31:17.957
Let's take a look at our Question of the Day!

31:18.037 --> 31:21.559
We have... De-den!

31:21.579 --> 31:24.080
2000 years is a long time to be around.

31:24.120 --> 31:24.460
Yes!

31:24.960 --> 31:28.042
I'm sure you both have seen a lot of anime in that time.

31:28.062 --> 31:28.882
Yes!

31:29.542 --> 31:34.645
What are some design tropes or aspects that you've seen slowly disappear over time?

31:35.085 --> 31:37.246
For me, it's gotta be heaven.

31:38.006 --> 31:39.687
Hair vents are wonderful.

31:39.707 --> 31:40.847
There's so many.

31:41.287 --> 31:41.667
Yeah.

31:41.928 --> 31:45.009
You know, the Nogen has to breathe a little bit.

31:45.509 --> 31:46.949
And you need hair vents for that.

31:48.750 --> 31:51.431
Really?

31:51.631 --> 31:53.732
My hair vents are bigger!

31:59.622 --> 32:06.406
But to answer the question... Aspects maybe?

32:06.506 --> 32:07.046
No?

32:07.727 --> 32:10.188
I know I talk about them all the time, but main robots.

32:10.268 --> 32:12.009
I miss the main robots so much.

32:12.049 --> 32:12.710
Main what?

32:12.750 --> 32:13.730
Main what?

32:13.871 --> 32:15.452
Robots!

32:15.812 --> 32:16.532
Robots!

32:16.612 --> 32:17.333
Robots?

32:17.453 --> 32:20.355
Main robots.

32:20.375 --> 32:25.057
She misses the main robots, okay?

32:27.759 --> 32:29.401
I don't need a big robot.

32:30.142 --> 32:31.845
I need big robots!

32:31.865 --> 32:38.233
I want them to be there for me.

32:40.935 --> 32:44.178
No, it's to help me get across the lake!

32:44.778 --> 32:48.742
It would help us!

32:48.762 --> 32:53.366
I want her to be there to help me get home from school!

32:54.147 --> 32:57.450
And then I'm gonna protect her memories at all costs!

32:59.867 --> 33:03.170
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

33:03.230 --> 33:04.791
Have a howl of a day!

33:18.902 --> 33:22.963
I think also just a general boy meets girl kind of you know.

33:22.983 --> 33:24.603
Urusei Yatsura.

33:24.923 --> 33:26.484
Oh My Goddess.

33:26.644 --> 33:27.264
Yeah!

33:27.604 --> 33:29.384
No, no, no, no!

33:29.424 --> 33:29.564
Don't!

33:29.604 --> 33:29.744
Don't!

33:29.784 --> 33:29.984
Don't!

33:30.104 --> 33:31.265
Magical girl.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.805
Extraordinary girl comes into your life.

33:34.945 --> 33:35.625
Yeah!

33:35.645 --> 33:35.785
Right!

33:35.985 --> 33:36.506
Right!

33:37.046 --> 33:37.806
I missed that.

33:38.006 --> 33:39.186
Right!

33:39.886 --> 33:41.006
Yeah!

33:41.367 --> 33:43.047
Doesn't count if it's a reboot.

33:43.947 --> 33:44.487
Reboot?

33:44.767 --> 33:45.627
Not a robot!

33:45.967 --> 33:47.008
Not a robot!

33:47.748 --> 33:48.328
Reboot.

33:48.908 --> 33:51.349
Yeah!

33:52.350 --> 33:53.950
And other aspects.

33:54.430 --> 33:54.570
Ah!

33:54.771 --> 33:57.912
The little sister who's annoying and wants love!

33:57.932 --> 34:00.733
And used to get away from me!

34:00.753 --> 34:03.054
Right?

34:03.094 --> 34:05.715
There hasn't been many of those recently, right?

34:07.736 --> 34:08.076
Hai.

34:08.376 --> 34:09.817
I miss that too.

34:11.878 --> 34:12.458
Yeah.

34:13.258 --> 34:14.559
Alright!

34:15.159 --> 34:16.560
Also zettai ryouiki.

34:16.620 --> 34:17.140
Morning deshita.

34:17.832 --> 34:18.072
BAU BAU!

34:18.092 --> 34:20.635
Why is zettai ryouiki not so common anymore?

34:33.014 --> 34:37.516
Well, thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions.

34:37.756 --> 34:42.138
Don't forget, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make together.

34:42.978 --> 34:46.580
And I would like to ask you for more help.

34:47.540 --> 34:51.242
Please use the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

34:51.522 --> 34:54.783
Send us the walksie going on your questions.

34:55.143 --> 34:56.784
I know you have lots of good questions.

34:56.804 --> 35:01.146
We've been seeing a bunch in the marshmallow box too as they come in.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.028
Also your Pero Sightings.

35:04.709 --> 35:06.750
And your Doggie of the Day is okay.

35:06.830 --> 35:07.611
Okay!

35:08.812 --> 35:09.593
We're waiting, okay?

35:09.633 --> 35:10.133
We're waiting!

35:10.153 --> 35:10.874
BAU BAU!

35:10.954 --> 35:12.836
BAU BAU!

35:13.336 --> 35:16.219
Well, we have another stream coming up again.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.500
Very soon here.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.603
We have the day!

35:20.683 --> 35:22.304
Seven days to die!

35:24.126 --> 35:25.347
It's hololive English!

35:25.447 --> 35:26.628
It's the first day!

35:27.029 --> 35:29.250
The big event is starting!

35:29.951 --> 35:31.252
Moco-chan!

35:31.312 --> 35:33.454
The goal is to survive.

35:33.494 --> 35:34.675
It says 7 days to die.

35:34.735 --> 35:37.437
It makes it sound like you need to die, but it's to survive.

35:37.958 --> 35:38.959
Let's survive.

35:40.722 --> 35:41.303
I don't know.

35:41.883 --> 35:42.764
I don't want to die.

35:42.784 --> 35:43.705
I don't want to die.

35:43.765 --> 35:44.546
I want to be like, oh!

35:45.006 --> 35:47.408
Everybody in hololive English has died at least once.

35:47.428 --> 35:50.831
FUWAMOCO is gonna be a survivor.

35:50.851 --> 35:51.192
Okay?

35:51.732 --> 35:53.214
Watch it happen, Ruffians.

35:53.334 --> 35:54.635
Watch it happen!

35:54.715 --> 35:55.416
Yeah!

35:55.496 --> 35:56.156
BAU BAU!

35:57.677 --> 35:59.198
And our schedule!

35:59.218 --> 36:05.943
Our schedule coming up at 5am on Thursday morning PT.

36:05.983 --> 36:09.726
We're gonna be having our first offline with Suwopatra!

36:09.786 --> 36:14.289
We're gonna be answering some Mashimaro's questions!

36:14.829 --> 36:17.751
And you know, we're just gonna have a really fun time together.

36:17.811 --> 36:20.873
If you don't know who Suwopatra, she is

36:21.193 --> 36:21.814
Amazing!

36:21.874 --> 36:22.494
Amazing!

36:22.514 --> 36:24.035
She's super cute!

36:24.135 --> 36:24.915

Demon Goddess who wrote Lifetime Showdown!

36:33.721 --> 36:34.341
Natural games!

36:34.381 --> 36:34.581
Yeah!

36:34.661 --> 36:35.922
She's so talented!

36:35.942 --> 36:41.346
We look up to her so much and we're so excited to be able to have a bunch of fun together!

36:41.366 --> 36:43.267
We know it's a bit early in the morning!

36:43.887 --> 36:47.753
But I'm sure it's gonna be fun so if you want to stop by, okay?

36:48.074 --> 36:50.137
BAU BAU!

36:50.277 --> 36:50.878

Did you notice?

36:53.082 --> 36:55.866
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

36:55.946 --> 36:57.889

Thank you Abyss!

37:05.777 --> 37:08.019

37:08.520 --> 37:12.343
Only a few steps until one of our biggest goals here.

37:12.363 --> 37:15.026
Thank you!

37:15.266 --> 37:19.250
Let's continue to have lots of them because there's even more stuff coming up this week.

37:19.690 --> 37:22.172
We have more 7 Days to Die, more FUWAMOCO Morning.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.475
We also have a very

37:24.915 --> 37:29.578
Special stream we're going to be a part of over on Marine-senpai's channel!

37:29.679 --> 37:34.682
We're going to be participating in Houshou Marine's Brain Battle!

37:35.203 --> 37:42.188
And we're going to become our own fluffy fuzzy version of Houshou Marine-Senchou-senpai's brain!

37:42.408 --> 37:46.391
And you know we're going to solve some very deep personal problems.

37:46.591 --> 37:46.791
Yes.

37:48.152 --> 37:48.813
It's going to be chaos.

37:49.531 --> 37:50.555
Please come and join!

37:50.595 --> 37:54.229
That's also gonna be a 4AM PT on Sunday!

37:55.593 --> 37:56.153
It'll be chaos.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.014
Do what you can.

37:57.434 --> 37:58.194
BAU BAU!

37:58.314 --> 38:01.515
And then for the doggy pack, we're playing Fall Guys!

38:01.675 --> 38:03.016
Please join us!

38:03.636 --> 38:04.837
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

38:04.857 --> 38:07.698
You never know what's gonna happen this week, Ruffians!

38:07.718 --> 38:08.718
BAU BAU!

38:08.878 --> 38:10.719
Thank you!

38:10.899 --> 38:13.120
We'll be looking forward to it!

38:13.180 --> 38:14.520
We definitely are.
