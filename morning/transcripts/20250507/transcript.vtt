00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:14.928
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.123
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.143
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:24.744 --> 00:05:28.147
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:31.370
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.752
BAU BAU!

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:40.780
And today, I'm your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.921
BAU BAU!

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.525
Thank you for joining us for our 150 foot episode!

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:47.686
150 foot!

00:05:47.787 --> 00:05:48.708
BAU BAU!

00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:49.228
150 foot!

00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:54.196
It's funny how things just light.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:58.062
I feel like it was the 150th episode just the other day.

00:05:58.362 --> 00:05:58.723
It was.

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.949
That's how it is!

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:14.686
Well, for Ruffians joining us today, maybe for the first time, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:15.888
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:19.553
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:24.625
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:28.274
Now please state your thoughts with the hashtag right now.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.923
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:35.652
Moco-chan, are you expecting to see every Ruffian's paw?

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.766
Show me your phone.

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:40.727
Ruffians.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:41.288
Well, Ruffians!

00:06:41.688 --> 00:06:45.493
Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:49.858
BAU BAU!

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.542
Ruffians don't wanna show Moco-chan their phone.

00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:53.203
Why?

00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:54.705
Why?

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.428
You gotta tweet the hashtag, right?

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.190
Yeah.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.432
BAU BAU.

00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:01.113
Yeah.

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:04.858
Maybe the Ruffians don't know what to tweet with it, Moco-chan.

00:07:04.878 --> 00:07:05.098
Yeah.

00:07:07.373 --> 00:07:14.599
BAU BAU!

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:17.027
BAU BAU!

00:07:17.047 --> 00:07:17.928
You're not on Twitter!

00:07:18.308 --> 00:07:18.849
Well, you're here.

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:23.695
That's even better, so... BAU BAU!

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:23.915
Thank you!

00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:24.135
Thank you!

00:07:24.616 --> 00:07:27.239
Wow, it's the middle of the week, Ruffians!

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.542
How's the week been going?

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:30.624
Going?

00:07:31.004 --> 00:07:31.605
It's going!

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:32.906
It's Wednesday!

00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:34.989
You made it.

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.751
You know, after Wednesday comes Thursday.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.035
Thursday's usually much better than Wednesday and then it's Friday.

00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:41.397
It's half past now.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:45.182
It's been a good week, ruff week?

00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:46.945
It's been pretty good?

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:49.588
Sleepy.

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:54.876
We'll do our best to make you have a better day today!

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:55.737
Moco-chan!

00:07:56.137 --> 00:07:59.061
Shall we get to our first exciting news of the day?

00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:05.410
Shall we make it better?

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.904
It's sort of questionable.

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:13.705
Questionable?

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:14.827
Questionable?

00:08:14.847 --> 00:08:16.329
What do you mean, Moco-chan?

00:08:18.652 --> 00:08:23.899
There's been another Pero Sighting.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.001
How is Pero better?

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:25.762
I didn't see it.

00:08:30.288 --> 00:08:33.793
Well, let's see where Pero has spotted the Moco-chan.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.367
That's a very fluffy, but nasty cafe latte.

00:08:44.387 --> 00:08:49.933
I don't know, I think nasty is correct, but fluffy... I don't know.

00:08:50.234 --> 00:08:53.697
I think it's time... You know, take that spoon.

00:08:54.058 --> 00:08:58.283
You stomp it in there and you go stir, stir, stir, stir!

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:03.729
Yeah, well you know, you could take two spoons and you could just go right in the middle of a pattern.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.813
Rip them apart with them!

00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:09.479
Why?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.381
Which is better?

00:09:11.403 --> 00:09:11.884
Yah!

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:14.209
Woah, yah, cool, yah!

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.133
That's the way to do it, right?

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:17.235
Do it very slowly.

00:09:17.736 --> 00:09:19.299
Why would you save him?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.266
No, no, no.

00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:22.546
Rippin' tail!

00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:24.931
Rippin' tail, yah!

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:25.873
Yah!

00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:27.777
No Ruffians!

00:09:29.123 --> 00:09:31.387
We're just trying to protect your smile, you know?

00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:33.892
And sometimes it's rough, right?

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:35.715
Yeah.

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:38.540
Just sometimes, huh?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.546
Ruffians, you seem... Whip and tear, whip and tear!

00:09:41.987 --> 00:09:42.828
Whip and tear!

00:09:42.888 --> 00:09:44.932
A perilous day keeps the doctor away?

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:50.081
I mean... I don't think that sounds right.

00:09:50.883 --> 00:09:53.207
But it doesn't sound wrong, necessarily.

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:55.796
We haven't asked the doctor.

00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:58.459
What about FUWAMOCO at the day?

00:09:58.519 --> 00:09:58.879
The day?

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.881
A day keeps the doctor away.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.202
Huh?

00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:02.882
Huh?

00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:04.604
That sounds better, no?

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:05.204
Maybe.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:06.886
Yeah.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.207
Apple, we're not apples!

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:09.968
We're demon dogs!

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:11.470
Yeah.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.414
Well, Ruffians, it's time to drink up your nasty happy latte here.

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:17.455
Get rid of it.

00:10:17.475 --> 00:10:17.575
Okay.

00:10:18.476 --> 00:10:20.037
BAU BAU!

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:23.380
Yeah.

00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:26.941
Our heads are apple shaped, huh?

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:29.404
Huh?

00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:30.365
Apple shaped!

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:32.328
Not apple FUWAMOCO.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.770
Huh?

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.495
I guess I could sort of see where this dumb crumbs always sort of went the whole game.

00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:39.956
Huh?

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:43.080
We're demon dogs, not fruits, okay?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.781
Not an apple.

00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:44.341
No.

00:10:44.682 --> 00:10:45.583
BAU BAU.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:46.784
BAU BAU!

00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:50.228
Although apples are tasty, but not as tasty as pondois.

00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:53.322
Monday was big news!

00:10:53.982 --> 00:11:01.613
Ruffians was a big, big milestone within hololive the other day!

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:01.733
Wow.

00:11:01.753 --> 00:11:10.866
Hoshomari of hololive Gen 3 found that she reached 4 million subscribers on YouTube!

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:25.345
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.813
Deserved!

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:28.735
Deserved!

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:29.756
Yes!

00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:30.498
Absolutely!

00:11:30.998 --> 00:11:34.103
Amazing!

00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:40.053
You know, Mari-senpai, she's always inspiring us with her creativity.

00:11:40.073 --> 00:11:43.198
Her work as an idol and a musician too.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:45.021
You know, just her...

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.318
Overwhelmingly, uh, what's the word for it?

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:54.411
Unique personality!

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.093
It's so negative!

00:11:55.113 --> 00:11:56.636
It's so negative!

00:11:56.656 --> 00:11:56.857
I love it!

00:11:56.877 --> 00:11:57.438
Unique personality.

00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:58.580
But you know, we really really look up to her.

00:11:59.142 --> 00:11:59.242
Yeah!

00:11:59.262 --> 00:12:01.607
But we know how hard she works too.

00:12:01.627 --> 00:12:01.727
Yeah.

00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:09.134
You know, it's a very very relative milestone after her first solo live last year too.

00:12:09.154 --> 00:12:12.257
And you know, it's a 4 million milestone.

00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:20.484
Just a couple days ago, she released a fully animated music video for one of her new songs from last year.

00:12:20.504 --> 00:12:21.405
Yeah, from her album.

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:24.648
A Honey Money World Densetsu no Yoru.

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:26.750
Honey Money World, right?

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.592
Sticky Money?

00:12:28.572 --> 00:12:36.480
I know, as usual, it's a super deluxe animated video with fluid animation!

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.524
It has a bit of a nostalgic feel to it too!

00:12:40.984 --> 00:12:43.767
I don't know, it's just, every video is a work of art!

00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:45.849
How did she do it?

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:47.331
It's a catchy song too!

00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:50.134
I like how an essential senpai song sounds.

00:12:50.454 --> 00:12:51.555
A bit, what's the word?

00:12:51.655 --> 00:12:52.296
Spicy?

00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:53.157
Spicy!

00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:54.478
Spicy!

00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:55.620
Catchy!

00:12:56.061 --> 00:13:00.689
No, it's a little more like a spicy vacation sound.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.416
I feel like it's very, you know how Senchou-senpai Pirates feel.

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:05.278
Yeah.

00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:09.626
Exactly right!

00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:13.092
I have a honeymoon almost stuck in my head now.

00:13:13.072 --> 00:13:18.901
I don't know, every single song is just amazing.

00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:26.193
Thank you so much Senchou-senpai for always being there for us to look up to.

00:13:26.213 --> 00:13:28.436
We'll continue doing our best too!

00:13:28.456 --> 00:13:29.077
But waiting for you!

00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.122
And I can't wait for what comes next too.

00:13:32.823 --> 00:13:36.269
BAU BAU!

00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.754
Senchou-senpai, she said she's aiming for 5 million now.

00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:42.475
BAU BAU!

00:13:43.276 --> 00:14:02.637
BAU BAU!

00:14:02.617 --> 00:14:05.261
Mio-senpai!

00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:07.985
She announced her new album "My Sparkle."

00:14:08.025 --> 00:14:10.869
It'll be releasing on August 20th.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.513
I think pre-orders have started now.

00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:22.106
And her solo live "Our Sparkle" will be happening on September 10th at Pia Arena!

00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:22.427
I'm so excited!

00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:25.131
Another album from Mio-senpai!

00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:28.298
We really really love Miyo-senpai's singing voice.

00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:33.589
You know howling is a classic, but Yakko Tsushin just always makes me feel good.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.956
I'm really looking forward to this new album.

00:14:37.357 --> 00:14:43.710
I was taking a peek the other day at the songs too, and all the amazing creators she's working with too.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.395
Mio-senpai has a great voice.

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:51.381
Mio-senpai is so kind too.

00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:55.187
Howling is your favorite hololive song.

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:57.931
Howling is so good.

00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:02.998
We're so excited and we'll be definitely there watching and cheering on when she howls.

00:15:02.978 --> 00:15:25.594
TRIGGER

00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:27.519
So much music!

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.405
Look at the album right there!

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:31.210
Too cool!

00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:34.398
I'm excited for it too you know!

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:35.702
Right!

00:15:35.943 --> 00:15:36.584
Right!

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:36.725
Right!

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:41.558
So many amazing content going on this year hololive!

00:15:41.538 --> 00:16:00.188
There's so much emotion to it.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:04.892
She has a new song, Kiyopito!

00:16:04.912 --> 00:16:05.313
Delicate and strong.

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:07.575
Her new song with Teddy Boy!

00:16:07.655 --> 00:16:10.278
So many things to listen to and check out!

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.921
And also too!

00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:15.242
Also it's not just that!

00:16:15.262 --> 00:16:18.746
Okayu-senpai has a solo live coming up too!

00:16:18.806 --> 00:16:20.247
May 28th!

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:21.248
Not too far!

00:16:21.268 --> 00:16:23.870
May 28th at Pier Arena!

00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.713
Persona Respect!

00:16:28.695 --> 00:16:29.736
Persona Respect, yes!

00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:32.540
Three solo lives!

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.982
Three solo lives!

00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:34.622
So many!

00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:35.904
Right!

00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:40.370
It's a busy year for senpai!

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.773
They don't stop coming!

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:43.794
No they don't!

00:16:43.814 --> 00:16:44.875
FUWAMOCO we love solo lives so!

00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:52.745
We get to see so many amazing performances from our senpai!

00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:54.848
I'm excited but also!

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:58.272
In addition to that, there's one more!

00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:08.193
Gamers is gonna be holding New Cho-Cho-Cho Gamers Fest at Saitama Super Arena.

00:17:08.473 --> 00:17:12.180
And it's gonna be two days, on July 5th and July 6th.

00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:18.413
But FUWAMOCO are also gonna be there as guests!

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:21.238
We're super honored and really excited!

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.155
I wonder what it's gonna be like.

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:23.836
Why is it so many?

00:17:24.197 --> 00:17:25.419
We almost forgot about it!

00:17:28.043 --> 00:17:28.123
Why?

00:17:28.143 --> 00:17:28.523
It's unforgettable!

00:17:28.543 --> 00:17:28.664
Right!

00:17:28.684 --> 00:17:29.084
Cho-cho-cho gave us!

00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:29.485
I'm so excited.

00:17:29.505 --> 00:17:30.887
It's gonna be so much fun.

00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:31.167
Right!

00:17:31.187 --> 00:17:36.215
And we're gonna be there along with Subaru-senpai and Mikocchi-senpai!

00:17:36.275 --> 00:17:37.998
We are FUWAMOCO!

00:17:38.018 --> 00:17:38.198
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:38.178 --> 00:17:40.742
I hope it's gonna be okay.

00:17:40.802 --> 00:17:42.906
It's not gonna get too chaotic, is it?

00:17:43.387 --> 00:17:44.949
Will there be online streaming tickets?

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.517
There is gonna be online streaming tickets for Cho-Cho-Cho Gamers!

00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:52.121
So please check it out as well there!

00:17:52.642 --> 00:17:54.145
What is Cho-Cho-Cho Gamers?

00:17:54.645 --> 00:17:55.747
Gamers Fest!

00:17:56.088 --> 00:17:59.173
It's a special festival with gamers!

00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:03.638
You know they play a bunch of games, a whole bunch of different special plans!

00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:06.501
But you'll have to find out, it's a little bit different for me to say.

00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:10.065
A solo live where there's a lot of music being performed!

00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:12.108
You know, it's gamers first!

00:18:12.128 --> 00:18:13.649
Gaming!

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:20.317
So... We'll all have to look forward to it and find out what happens, huh?

00:18:20.337 --> 00:18:20.918
BAU BAU!

00:18:20.938 --> 00:18:22.279
I'm just so excited, you know!

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.943
So many solo lives already announced and happening this year!

00:18:25.963 --> 00:18:29.127
You know...

00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:31.767
What's happening in hololive?

00:18:33.129 --> 00:18:34.692
It's exciting!

00:18:34.712 --> 00:18:36.754
BAU BAU!

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.759
But I feel like we've been really lucky.

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:44.926
Because we've had lots of chances to be able to chat with Mio-senpai recently.

00:18:45.387 --> 00:18:52.617
And actually the other day, we even got a morning phone call from Mio-senpai!

00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:58.391
Mio-senpai called us very early in the morning.

00:18:59.453 --> 00:19:01.779
I was very very sleepy still.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.324
Moco-chan, you're a little bit awake.

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:05.106
A bit awake.

00:19:05.326 --> 00:19:05.988
A bit awake.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:11.340
I had this waking up for a while.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.462
Should I get up now?

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.752
Oh, you should get up now!

00:19:16.936 --> 00:19:18.779
Get up now!

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:21.764
It's very hard to wake up recently, Ruffians.

00:19:21.844 --> 00:19:23.246
I'm sure you understand.

00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:25.530
Are you feeling like that right now?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:25.630
Huh?

00:19:28.114 --> 00:19:31.219
Moco-chan, can you wake the Ruffians up like you wake me up?

00:19:32.982 --> 00:19:34.385
Oh, you have to get up now!

00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:36.929
You have to get up now!

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.972
If you don't get up, I'm not gonna get up!

00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:41.857
I have to get up, okay?

00:19:41.877 --> 00:19:43.198
I have to get up, okay?

00:19:43.218 --> 00:19:44.839
Moco-chan, I'm just... I'm awake!

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.621
I'm just gonna stretch here!

00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:47.482
I'm just stretching, okay?

00:19:47.502 --> 00:19:47.782
No stretching!

00:19:47.802 --> 00:19:48.222
You have to get up!

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:49.103
No stretching!

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:49.644
It's okay, Moco-chan.

00:19:49.664 --> 00:19:52.506
Just... No, you can't just... You can't just stand stretching, okay?

00:19:52.886 --> 00:19:53.667
You have to get up.

00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:54.908
I'm not awake.

00:19:56.289 --> 00:19:57.290
BAU BAU.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.450
Get up.

00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:58.752
You should go.

00:19:58.852 --> 00:20:00.413
That looks like stretching to me.

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:00.533
Yeah.

00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:06.718
That's an excuse, Moco-chan.

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:06.899
Yeah.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:09.141
I'm just... I'm just stretching, okay?

00:20:09.161 --> 00:20:09.881
Give me a moment.

00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:10.782
I'm just stretching.

00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:14.535
I don't know why that's been waiting for so long, huh, Moco-chan?

00:20:14.555 --> 00:20:17.460
Take the comments!

00:20:19.203 --> 00:20:21.366
Okay, that's a way to get hated, okay?

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:23.009
That's anger.

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:25.252
That's anger!

00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:29.679
And then you get a FUWAMOCO that's like... That's what mama puppy used to do.

00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:31.121
That's what mama puppy does.

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:34.587
And then FUWAMOCO are grumpy.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.850
Angry puppies.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.334
Right in the morning.

00:20:40.462 --> 00:20:44.751
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:49.196
Blankets, pots and pans.

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:52.540
Wrong paw!

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:52.720
Exactly!

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.763
It starts off the very wrong paw!

00:20:55.783 --> 00:20:58.606
I'm just gonna go back to sleep harder because now I'm grumpy.

00:20:58.626 --> 00:20:59.987
Yes, exactly!

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:01.989
No blankets, I don't care.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.411
Pots and pans, I don't care.

00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.712
I'm gonna go back to sleep harder.

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:09.137
But luckily, that wasn't the case with Miyo-chan's paw.

00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:10.839
We had a very nice chat.

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:13.962
We chatted about what's first for us.

00:21:13.942 --> 00:21:17.406
I wish Mio-senpai could wake us up every morning.

00:21:17.426 --> 00:21:21.430
I feel much more energized and ready to go.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.351
FUWAMOCO!

00:21:24.053 --> 00:21:25.394
I'm hungry.

00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:30.159
Do you want breakfast?

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:32.742
I want breakfast from Mio-senpai.

00:21:33.223 --> 00:21:34.804
You have to wake up to Mio.

00:21:36.126 --> 00:21:38.248
I'm very lucky for bees.

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:42.953
But I think this is also the first place that Ruffians can ever listen to

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.572
Sleepy.

00:21:44.592 --> 00:21:47.060
Very sleepy voice, FUWAMOCO.

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:50.390
She's yours in meetings.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.881
Yeah.

00:21:54.362 --> 00:21:54.543
BAU BAU!

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:57.853
We so like you!

00:21:58.222 --> 00:21:59.344
Wow!

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:01.108
Awesome!

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.195
There is some interesting information!

00:22:05.397 --> 00:22:09.606
Moco-chan is very excited about this!

00:22:09.847 --> 00:22:10.689
Wow!

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.974
Poruru-oneechan!

00:22:12.994 --> 00:22:14.577
She revealed in the...

00:22:14.995 --> 00:22:15.977
Mio.

00:22:15.997 --> 00:22:16.457
Super.

00:22:16.778 --> 00:22:17.359
Miko.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.761
The legend.

00:22:19.342 --> 00:22:21.586
Life advice.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:28.858
She revealed that she's been having a very fulfilled life at the gym recently.

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:32.244
Mico-chan is very happy, right?

00:22:32.264 --> 00:22:37.172
She said that she's having lots of fun going to the gym and swimming.

00:22:37.152 --> 00:22:57.490
That's what happens when you go to the gym and you swim.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.511
Yeah.

00:22:58.571 --> 00:22:59.092
Swimming.

00:22:59.552 --> 00:23:03.136
She said she went swimming for a few hours.

00:23:03.156 --> 00:23:03.256
Yeah.

00:23:03.497 --> 00:23:06.921
I was imagining though, what kind of swimsuit do you think she swims in?

00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:11.626
I feel like, you know, like the active style swimsuit.

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:12.367
A one-piece.

00:23:12.387 --> 00:23:14.869
A one-piece with the back that's kind of open.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.370
Yeah.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.251
And the straps.

00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:17.793
A bit high-legged-ish.

00:23:18.494 --> 00:23:19.815
A bit high-legged?

00:23:19.795 --> 00:23:20.978
A bit, a bit.

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.585
Does it have lots of colourful stripes, Moco-chan?

00:23:23.605 --> 00:23:23.986
No, no.

00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:25.149
Vertical stripes?

00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:25.509
No.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.552
Horizontal stripes?

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:26.793
No.

00:23:27.094 --> 00:23:27.675
Ruffles?

00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:28.036
No.

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:29.600
No.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.482
What colour is it?

00:23:30.502 --> 00:23:31.645
It's very simple.

00:23:33.025 --> 00:23:38.992
It's too early to be imagining Pororori-chan in a swimsuit.

00:23:39.012 --> 00:23:39.953
A floral pattern.

00:23:39.973 --> 00:23:40.033
No.

00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:42.095
No shimo shimo.

00:23:42.115 --> 00:23:42.396
No.

00:23:42.936 --> 00:23:43.237
No.

00:23:43.617 --> 00:23:43.897
No.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.562
Yeah.

00:23:47.662 --> 00:23:50.385
I can imagine her diving.

00:23:50.745 --> 00:23:52.027
One of the diving boys.

00:23:52.668 --> 00:23:55.150
Like a dolphin.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.352
Like a dolphin.

00:23:56.452 --> 00:23:56.552
Yeah.

00:23:58.355 --> 00:24:00.739
Well, I share all my experience so far.

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:01.860
Transfer's right.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.964
Yeah.

00:24:06.447 --> 00:24:06.547
Yeah.

00:24:06.568 --> 00:24:06.728
BAU BAU!

00:24:06.748 --> 00:24:07.549
I'll go back to the gym for a little.

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:07.749
Ume-chan!

00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:11.836
It's never too early to be talking about swimsuits.

00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:13.198
Well, Ruffians.

00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:16.082
Swimsuits.

00:24:16.102 --> 00:24:18.285
Recently, I noticed.

00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:19.607
I'm clear.

00:24:19.627 --> 00:24:20.789
I don't understand why.

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:24.615
The golden swimsuits.

00:24:26.553 --> 00:24:27.154
What is that thing?

00:24:27.795 --> 00:24:30.117
Huh?

00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:30.458
Huh?

00:24:30.918 --> 00:24:30.998
Huh?

00:24:31.018 --> 00:24:31.819
Huh?

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:32.961
What is this trend?

00:24:35.244 --> 00:24:35.504
Ruffians!

00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:37.166
Heck yeah!

00:24:37.186 --> 00:24:37.386
Heck yeah!

00:24:38.668 --> 00:24:40.770
Huh?

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.213
You know there's lots of them in Tsukumizu.

00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:43.313
Yes!

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:43.634
Navy Tsukumizu.

00:24:43.654 --> 00:24:43.974
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:43.994 --> 00:24:44.555
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:44.575 --> 00:24:44.895
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:44.915 --> 00:24:45.316
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:45.716
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:45.736 --> 00:24:46.337
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:46.357 --> 00:24:47.018
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:47.038 --> 00:24:47.378
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:47.719
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:48.059
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:48.399
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:48.820
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.260
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:49.601
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:49.941
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:50.282
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:50.642
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:50.662 --> 00:24:51.263
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:51.283 --> 00:24:51.643
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:51.663 --> 00:24:51.984
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:52.004 --> 00:24:52.324
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:52.665
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:52.685 --> 00:24:53.005
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:53.345
White Tsukumizu.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:53.826
White Tsuk

00:24:54.397 --> 00:24:57.664
We look like we're like, lemon flavored or something.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:58.647
Like we're ice cream.

00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:00.491
I feel like we look like trophies.

00:25:01.012 --> 00:25:01.794
Trophies!

00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:03.578
FUWAMOCO trophies!

00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:06.083
Is that what the golden bathing suit does?

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:09.070
Why not silver bathing suit?

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.135
It looks good on us!

00:25:11.155 --> 00:25:13.941
Thank you, but... the clothes are... the hair...

00:25:13.921 --> 00:25:19.409
It's for high visibility for safety!

00:25:19.729 --> 00:25:20.490
For safety?

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.532
That's the reason!

00:25:21.552 --> 00:25:23.935
Maybe if you go to like a night pool?

00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:28.121
Not because it's Golden Week, like the Ruffians have been mentioning!

00:25:28.141 --> 00:25:28.782
A night pool!

00:25:28.802 --> 00:25:29.783
Because for Golden Week!

00:25:30.224 --> 00:25:32.767
I don't think that's for visibility, Moco-chan.

00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:36.172
Who wears socks in swimsuits?

00:25:37.413 --> 00:25:40.738
Everybody should.

00:25:41.832 --> 00:25:43.555
It's my safety!

00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:45.778
So Ruffians!

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:55.312
You know, when you make sure that you go out for your walk, like today I went on a walk, make sure you wear your visibility golden scoomies, okay?

00:25:55.332 --> 00:25:57.996
And that way nobody can miss you!

00:25:59.258 --> 00:25:59.678
Go on it!

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.361
You wear one!

00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.165
You wear the golden scoomies!

00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:07.770
I feel like I can't keep up with the trends.

00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:10.354
Maybe this is okay.

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:16.002
BAU BAU!

00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:21.029
BAU BAU!

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:22.551
Is this how we start off the day?

00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:25.215
It's FUWAMOCO Morning, that kind of show, Moco-chan.

00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:27.539
It's everything.

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:31.424
FUWAMOCO Morning is everything.

00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:36.231
Well, Moco-chan, I'm feeling kind of... off.

00:26:36.732 --> 00:26:39.516
Now that there's so much bathing suit talk.

00:26:39.656 --> 00:26:40.257
Why?

00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:44.099
Can you help with that?

00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:46.222
Maybe.

00:26:46.723 --> 00:26:47.264
Maybe.

00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:49.908
Bofit, are you feeling off?

00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:50.509
Silliness.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.631
Silliness.

00:26:53.814 --> 00:26:59.943
Well, I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything.

00:27:00.023 --> 00:27:01.165
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:27:03.575 --> 00:27:04.737
Ruffians!

00:27:05.618 --> 00:27:06.980
It's that time again!

00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:10.665
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:14.691
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:18.296
Ruffians!

00:27:19.178 --> 00:27:20.600
I see you there!

00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:24.105
You know, you've been doing your best every day, right?

00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:25.286
Right!

00:27:26.007 --> 00:27:26.588
Recently!

00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:28.030
Every day!

00:27:29.713 --> 00:27:32.637
Actually, maybe you've been even

00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:35.789
Putting in more than irregular 100%!

00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:40.297
Even doing 200%!

00:27:43.442 --> 00:27:48.210
And maybe pushing yourself way past your best.

00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:50.434
No?

00:27:50.454 --> 00:27:54.962
Maybe no one notices it when it all goes for granted by others.

00:27:56.073 --> 00:28:01.042
But what matters the most is that you know yourself how hard you're working, okay Ruffians?

00:28:01.844 --> 00:28:07.655
Most importantly, you need to make sure that you're happy and that you're not overdoing it, okay?

00:28:08.637 --> 00:28:11.382
Make sure to look after yourself first and foremost.

00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:17.294
And you know, maybe it's time to take a moment to do something just a little special and get a good recharge.

00:28:17.615 --> 00:28:18.136
Okay!

00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:21.264
Make sure to rest when you need to!

00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:23.329
Do your best!

00:28:23.349 --> 00:28:24.993
Ganbatte de!

00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:27.278
Bye bye!

00:28:29.114 --> 00:28:33.323
FUWAMOCO.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.933
Ruffians!

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:52.841
Let's take a look at who our Doggie of the Day is today!

00:28:52.962 --> 00:29:00.194
Our Doggie of the Day is... Today's Doggie of the Day is... Today's two doggies!

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:05.283
We have Ria and Moe!

00:29:05.303 --> 00:29:05.403
Mama!

00:29:05.423 --> 00:29:06.024
Two little fluffballs!

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:09.110
They look like little puppy angels!

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.153
They're shining!

00:29:11.133 --> 00:29:14.016
Those ears!

00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:15.819
Little triangle fluffy ears.

00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:16.840
Pink and blue colors.

00:29:17.781 --> 00:29:17.921
Kawaii!

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:22.747
Oh, I wonder where that inspiration was taken from, huh?

00:29:24.749 --> 00:29:29.355
But you know, that's so amazing that you added them into your family!

00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:33.520
It just grew so much happier now!

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:33.700
BAU BAU!

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:39.587
I know, I'm sure there's a lot more of a course now, a course of BAU BAUs going on.

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:42.631
How does Roya Roya Bow Bow?

00:29:42.651 --> 00:29:43.853
Roy first.

00:29:44.594 --> 00:29:51.624
I feel like Roy is probably very energetic.

00:29:51.644 --> 00:29:52.045
Bow Bow Bow Bow Bow!

00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:52.525
Bow Bow Bow Bow!

00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:52.966
Bow Bow Bow Bow!

00:29:52.986 --> 00:29:55.249
Very talkative Roya.

00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.369
Roya.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.312
Maybe a bit more.

00:29:57.332 --> 00:29:59.095
Bow Bow.

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:00.637
Bow Bow.

00:30:01.478 --> 00:30:01.798
Bow Bow.

00:30:01.818 --> 00:30:01.939
Cute.

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:04.382
It sounds like they are singing a song all the time.

00:30:04.422 --> 00:30:07.887
Together I'm sure they are always singing.

00:30:08.913 --> 00:30:11.819
They're super cute.

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:12.159
Very precious.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.846
And you know, they're brand new to your family.

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:20.776
And I'm sure that they're still adjusting, maybe making little mistakes here and there.

00:30:21.176 --> 00:30:26.346
But just know, they'll grow into the best doggies ever, okay?

00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:30.134
Yeah, you know, even if there's little mistakes, it's okay.

00:30:30.234 --> 00:30:31.917
They're still learning.

00:30:31.897 --> 00:30:36.205
So you know, make sure to give them lots of head pats too, okay?

00:30:36.686 --> 00:30:43.560
Welcome to the family, boy over here!

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.622
BAU BAU!

00:30:44.702 --> 00:30:44.882
So cute!

00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:47.307
Ruffians, you're getting those paws up there.

00:30:47.287 --> 00:30:49.391
Some fresh air too, right?

00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:55.602
Well, today I went on a walk with this Ruffian man.

00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:55.762
De-den!

00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:58.046
A nice walk on the tree.

00:30:59.348 --> 00:31:00.590
Such a pretty tree!

00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:02.253
It's Moco-chan pink!

00:31:04.197 --> 00:31:08.644
Last look at the tree before finishing another semester.

00:31:09.245 --> 00:31:11.910
Congratulations!

00:31:12.127 --> 00:31:13.550
Is it that time?

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.435
I guess it's that time, you know.

00:31:16.455 --> 00:31:17.497
All of a sudden.

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:22.406
Wish it wasn't easy, but you did it!

00:31:22.426 --> 00:31:29.258
And you know, I'm sure that this beautiful tree will be looking forward to when you come back for more learning at the end of the summer time.

00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:32.404
Although it might be a little bit more green.

00:31:33.145 --> 00:31:36.531
Meet you at the Mococo Tree!

00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:38.775
The Mococochi it shall be.

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.580
Yes, it is now named the Mococochi.

00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:44.666
It reminds me of Fuwawa because it's so fluffy.

00:31:45.087 --> 00:31:51.058
Wow, it will be the Mococochi, yeah.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.889
But good luck and enjoy your break!

00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:57.490
BAU BAU!

00:31:58.094 --> 00:32:00.740
FUWAMOCO Next we have our Question of the Day.

00:32:01.442 --> 00:32:04.569
Today's Question of the Day is... FUWAMOCO De-den!

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:14.533
There has been an ongoing conspiracy theory amongst certain Ruffians that Mococo and Pero are actually one and the same.

00:32:14.513 --> 00:32:25.609
I think you have no evidence.

00:32:27.272 --> 00:32:31.678
This is completely baseless.

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:32.940
Pero.

00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:34.804
You like this question?

00:32:34.824 --> 00:32:34.984
Damn!

00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:36.907
I think this is offensive.

00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:38.751
I think this is false.

00:32:39.031 --> 00:32:40.814
Ruffians, are you okay?

00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:42.718
Baseless accusations.

00:32:42.978 --> 00:32:44.160
Accusations.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:44.461
Yes.

00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:46.204
Wild conspiracy.

00:32:47.426 --> 00:32:52.435
Conspiracies are good, Ruffians.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.032
Moco-chan is fuzzy!

00:32:55.513 --> 00:32:56.834
No, there is no evidence!

00:32:57.215 --> 00:32:58.236
Pero's nasty!

00:32:58.256 --> 00:32:59.877
You said the evidence, there's no evidence.

00:33:00.338 --> 00:33:01.379
Pero's a mentor.

00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:02.160
That can't be.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.843
I see Pero and Moco-chan together.

00:33:04.883 --> 00:33:06.665
Ruffians.

00:33:08.106 --> 00:33:09.087
Faceless.

00:33:10.148 --> 00:33:11.009
Are you okay?

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.811
Are you okay?

00:33:13.472 --> 00:33:14.893
I don't know about this.

00:33:14.913 --> 00:33:16.495
I know things are rough, you know.

00:33:16.515 --> 00:33:18.397
It's a Wednesday, Wednesday's blah.

00:33:18.917 --> 00:33:19.418
But...

00:33:20.815 --> 00:33:29.085
I guess I'll forgive you, maybe.

00:33:29.105 --> 00:33:29.746
I could.

00:33:29.766 --> 00:33:30.587
I could forgive you.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:39.098
Maybe you need to keep glasses?

00:33:39.118 --> 00:33:41.541
Glasses are nice!

00:33:43.124 --> 00:33:49.353
Don't be embarrassed.

00:33:49.374 --> 00:33:49.574
It's okay.

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:49.754
BAU BAU!

00:33:49.774 --> 00:33:51.857
Thank you, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:33:51.877 --> 00:33:56.504
Remember, you already used the hashtag #FWMCMORNING once today, right?

00:33:57.025 --> 00:33:58.207
So now it's easy!

00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:00.410
Now you can just send us your questions.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.537
Thank you, Ruffians, for all your questions on Twitter earlier today!

00:34:04.897 --> 00:34:07.902
But you can also send us your doggy holidays!

00:34:08.262 --> 00:34:11.427
Your walks, you know, it's getting so nice out there!

00:34:11.407 --> 00:34:13.629
And then maybe your Pero Sighting too.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:18.715
Although, uh... Maybe get glasses first.

00:34:20.937 --> 00:34:21.037
Yeah.

00:34:21.057 --> 00:34:21.478
BAU BAU!

00:34:21.598 --> 00:34:22.599
And for our next team!

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:25.963
We have... De-den!

00:34:27.544 --> 00:34:29.567
FUWAMOCO is this a... Mistake?

00:34:29.687 --> 00:34:30.087
Mistake?

00:34:30.107 --> 00:34:34.332
I... No, it's not because I... Ruffians!

00:34:35.233 --> 00:34:38.376
For the first time ever we kinda overslept.

00:34:38.862 --> 00:34:45.709
It's been rough with you doing a lot of recordings and homework, but... New song!

00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:46.430
New-ish song.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:50.394
But with the Doggy Pack, finally!

00:34:50.554 --> 00:34:51.615
Finally, finally!

00:34:51.635 --> 00:34:55.299
We're gonna be having our after party for our new cover song!

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.423
Yes, it is in English, so please check it out!

00:34:59.543 --> 00:35:01.125
Our first cover song in English!

00:35:01.525 --> 00:35:05.089
Thank you, Mofus, for understanding.

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:10.274
It means a lot to us because we're both panicking a little bit.

00:35:10.795 --> 00:35:15.099
But now we'll have a really nice comfy chat all together.

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.882
And be able to talk about all my feelings and thoughts.

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.524
And everything that went into Christmas.

00:35:21.765 --> 00:35:25.369
Thank you Ruffians!

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:25.769
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.212
And we'll take a look at our schedule.

00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:31.515
And we'll continue.

00:35:34.516 --> 00:35:40.788
But FUWAMOCO continues with a big finale on Saturday, DE.

00:35:40.808 --> 00:35:48.122
We hope that you'll continue to join us and the rest of hololive English all together for our adventures in Labrador.

00:35:48.763 --> 00:35:52.972
And on Sunday, it's Narada's very first birthday!

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:56.338
And we're gonna be over on her channel.

00:35:56.318 --> 00:35:57.139
On our channel!

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:00.242
We're gonna be playing Among Us!

00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:03.605
All together with our whole Ien-senpai boy!

00:36:04.045 --> 00:36:07.048
And celebrating now it is birthday!

00:36:07.148 --> 00:36:07.688
Yeah, first birthday!

00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:10.090
Been a while since we all played Among Us, right?

00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:12.292
Let's see what happens.

00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:14.034
