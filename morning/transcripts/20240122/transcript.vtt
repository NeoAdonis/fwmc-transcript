05:11.890 --> 05:14.375
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:15.657 --> 05:18.719
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:18.759 --> 05:22.181
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:22.261 --> 05:24.102
BAU BAU!

05:24.782 --> 05:27.704
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.646
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:30.666 --> 05:32.587
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:32.607 --> 05:33.608
BAU BAU!

05:35.467 --> 05:40.329
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.710 --> 05:42.870
BAU BAU!

05:43.231 --> 05:48.313
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for officially our 71st episode!

05:48.333 --> 05:49.854
Thank you Ruffians!

05:49.974 --> 05:51.734
And it's a new week too!

05:59.958 --> 06:03.482
Let's do our best to sleep okay?

06:03.823 --> 06:11.692
For some Ruffians that might be joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show.

06:11.752 --> 06:12.773
We try very hard.

06:13.314 --> 06:14.876
Held every Friday.

06:15.276 --> 06:16.536
That's my name.

06:16.796 --> 06:17.337
A.k.a.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.257
FUWAMOCO!

06:18.277 --> 06:21.798
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:21.818 --> 06:27.980
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

06:28.080 --> 06:29.760
Please tweet your thoughts!

06:32.321 --> 06:33.381
What was that, Moco-chan?

06:33.621 --> 06:34.042
Tweet.

06:34.642 --> 06:34.802
Oh.

06:35.242 --> 06:35.522
Tweet.

06:37.026 --> 06:42.910
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:43.050 --> 06:46.912
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:46.932 --> 06:49.594
BAU BAU!

06:49.614 --> 06:51.835
I definitely didn't mess up.

06:52.035 --> 06:52.415
No!

06:53.416 --> 06:53.616
No.

06:55.137 --> 06:56.798
You know, it's a Monday morning.

06:56.938 --> 07:00.960
It's okay if you kind of, you know, it's a little bit fuzzy still.

07:01.040 --> 07:01.381
Right.

07:01.401 --> 07:03.682
Was it tough to get out of bed today, Ruffians?

07:05.365 --> 07:13.391
I'm sorry to tell you when you're still so sleepy, Ruffians, but...

07:35.188 --> 07:38.489
There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:40.790 --> 07:41.110
Yeah.

07:41.910 --> 07:42.991
Gonna break the news.

07:44.391 --> 07:45.432
Okay, Moco-chan.

07:46.032 --> 07:46.492
Tell me.

07:47.993 --> 07:48.613
What happened?

07:48.953 --> 07:49.433
Well!

07:49.453 --> 07:51.074
He was spotted.

07:51.094 --> 07:51.174
Here.

07:55.595 --> 08:02.258
This time Pero himself wasn't spotted, but our message with the snow that he left was...

08:03.735 --> 08:05.576
While you're out on a walk.

08:06.357 --> 08:08.118
Wait, you found this in a playground!

08:09.199 --> 08:12.962
Well, I guess it's good that, you know, it'll just eventually melt away.

08:12.982 --> 08:13.622
Yeah.

08:13.762 --> 08:14.643
It's not permanent.

08:14.883 --> 08:17.665
It won't bother anyone for that long.

08:17.986 --> 08:19.627
Yeah, it won't melt that deep.

08:19.687 --> 08:21.408
I'm sure it'll melt away soon.

08:21.428 --> 08:26.072
Right, but you must've just missed crossing paths with Perroccino.

08:26.152 --> 08:26.632
Right!

08:27.152 --> 08:28.453
Oh, you're really lucky.

08:28.613 --> 08:29.334
Oh, that you didn't.

08:29.713 --> 08:31.034
But yeah, you're right.

08:31.074 --> 08:34.035
Because you know, he would've ruined your day for sure.

08:34.635 --> 08:35.755
He's nasty.

08:36.316 --> 08:40.957
Look at the spelling there.

08:41.638 --> 08:44.159
You know, he acts like he's so great.

08:44.299 --> 08:47.700
But yet, you know, he still makes mistakes too.

08:49.198 --> 08:53.180
Although I have to say, at least his handwriting is nice.

08:55.361 --> 08:57.262
BAU BAU!

08:57.342 --> 09:00.164
We're glad you had a nice morning walk too.

09:00.564 --> 09:02.065
No peddle!

09:02.605 --> 09:03.225
Good, good.

09:03.926 --> 09:05.247
BAU BAU!

09:06.754 --> 09:08.315
Oh, Ruffians!

09:08.796 --> 09:10.397
It's finally on!

09:10.537 --> 09:11.638
It's finally on!

09:11.658 --> 09:15.100
hololive English is cover of Minecraft!

09:15.120 --> 09:19.703
Please sign up and release on Bii-senpai's channel!

09:20.224 --> 09:21.625
Did you watch the Ruffians?

09:23.121 --> 09:28.482
I know it's a D&D simulator too, but you know maybe there's some Ruffians who are a little busy them too, right?

09:28.502 --> 09:29.243
Right!

09:29.343 --> 09:30.963
Go check it out, okay?

09:31.223 --> 09:31.603
Yeah, go on!

09:31.623 --> 09:38.625
Yeah, you know Minecraft has every member call out English all singing together for the first time.

09:38.645 --> 09:38.745
Right!

09:38.965 --> 09:41.006
And really emotional lyrics too.

09:41.426 --> 09:43.746
It's a really heartwarming cover.

09:43.926 --> 09:45.627
Yeah, you waited a long time.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.081
At least 20 times good, good, good.

09:49.101 --> 09:50.222
Good, good, you know.

09:50.662 --> 09:55.046
It's so colorful and pretty and we all have such cool alternative outfits.

09:56.087 --> 09:58.929
Also to match each other in a very mysterious way.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.913
All similar, all individual.

10:04.605 --> 10:09.969
But I think with Minecraft, though, you can really hear how unique each member's voices are.

10:10.389 --> 10:14.832
And you can also catch some new combinations that you've never heard before, too.

10:14.932 --> 10:15.112
Yeah!

10:15.352 --> 10:15.592
I know!

10:15.613 --> 10:18.935
With Aime-senpai, Nerissa, Moco-chan, and Kiara-senpai.

10:18.955 --> 10:19.315
Yeah!

10:19.335 --> 10:20.056
Right!

10:20.436 --> 10:24.859
You know, it was really wonderful getting to sing together all with everyone.

10:24.899 --> 10:25.499
Right?

10:25.980 --> 10:27.641
Please listen lots, okay?

10:27.661 --> 10:28.581
Yeah.

10:28.761 --> 10:33.184
It makes us really, really, really thankful to be members of hololive English.

10:34.265 --> 10:34.865
BAU BAU!

10:35.946 --> 10:38.007
Again!

10:38.067 --> 10:42.190
Thank you Mei-senpai!

10:42.210 --> 10:43.470
BAU BAU!

10:43.510 --> 10:45.552
We listened at least 10 times!

10:45.932 --> 10:49.514
Why Mumei-senpai's voice is so cool, right?

10:49.614 --> 10:52.435
Kouji-senpai too, I'm very surprised.

10:52.616 --> 10:52.936
BAU BAU!

10:52.996 --> 10:56.037
Ruffians!

10:56.057 --> 11:02.161
I don't know, you might have missed this.

11:02.918 --> 11:15.382
But, the other day, Ao-kun from ReGLOSS held their first one-on-one collab stream with a very special... Secret guest.

11:15.542 --> 11:19.283
Do you know who that was, Ruffians?

11:19.343 --> 11:20.843
The secret guest.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.984
First one-on-one collab.

11:23.624 --> 11:25.164
It was not with my sneeze.

11:25.804 --> 11:30.626
Not with Moco-chan's sneeze, but... Well, it's kind of not that far off, maybe.

11:37.045 --> 11:43.389
That collab partner was none other than AOKU and themselves!

11:44.050 --> 11:44.390
Yeah!

11:44.950 --> 11:47.292
Oh, well, right.

11:47.881 --> 11:48.922
Whoa.

11:49.282 --> 11:49.663
Yeah.

11:50.043 --> 11:56.089
And for a lot of reasons, it was a very, very, very silly stream.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.131
Yeah.

11:58.712 --> 12:02.536
Yeah.

12:02.656 --> 12:10.684
But it seems that Aokun and Aokun here are now being called a dirty FUWAMOCO.

12:11.104 --> 12:11.745
Because of it.

12:13.735 --> 12:15.256
Dirty FUWAMOCO!

12:16.076 --> 12:18.358
That's not very fair, Aokun.

12:18.438 --> 12:18.899
No.

12:18.959 --> 12:19.399
Why?

12:19.699 --> 12:21.061
What do you think, Ruffians?

12:22.302 --> 12:22.782
Yeah.

12:23.963 --> 12:24.563
Yeah.

12:25.524 --> 12:27.146
Not fair, Aokun.

12:27.886 --> 12:29.407
Yeah, that's not right.

12:29.888 --> 12:30.708
That's not right.

12:30.748 --> 12:31.769
Not fair at all.

12:31.849 --> 12:32.270
Right.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.211
And also!

12:34.872 --> 12:35.853
What do you mean?

12:35.873 --> 12:37.514
Dirty FUWAMOCO!

12:37.574 --> 12:37.834
Hai!

12:39.483 --> 12:43.605
No, it sort of makes it sound like we're dirty.

12:44.945 --> 12:45.266
No.

12:47.947 --> 12:48.227
No.

12:49.167 --> 12:53.389
I like to think that there's no such thing as dirty FUWAMOCO.

12:53.509 --> 12:53.869
Yeah.

12:54.670 --> 12:55.190
You know that.

12:55.730 --> 13:00.492
Even if we fall into a pit of mud, that we're not dirty.

13:01.232 --> 13:04.114
So, don't call us dirty FUWAMOCO, okay?

13:06.295 --> 13:07.556
We're FUWAMOCO!

13:07.996 --> 13:11.438
You know, fluffy and fuzzy FUWAMOCO!

13:11.979 --> 13:12.899
Forever and ever.

13:13.780 --> 13:14.160
Right?

13:15.261 --> 13:18.643
No dirty FUWAMOCO, just fluffy and fuzzy FUWAMOCO.

13:19.183 --> 13:19.724
Clean.

13:21.325 --> 13:22.705
BAU BAU!

13:22.766 --> 13:25.207
Not skeevy.

13:25.307 --> 13:26.548
Not sweaty.

13:27.589 --> 13:28.029
Clean.

13:29.270 --> 13:31.791
Definitely was not sweaty.

13:33.652 --> 13:34.473
Definitely not.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.320
BAU BAU!

13:37.340 --> 13:38.861
I've never said such a thing.

13:39.301 --> 13:46.283
BAU BAU!

13:47.243 --> 13:49.704
BAU BAU!

13:49.824 --> 13:50.024
No!

13:50.084 --> 13:51.684
Yeah, no.

13:51.904 --> 13:53.505
No dirty FUWAMOCO.

13:53.605 --> 13:53.705
No!

13:54.145 --> 13:54.965
You know that.

13:56.005 --> 13:57.266
You know that, okay.

13:58.006 --> 13:59.466
Ruffians.

14:00.867 --> 14:03.767
You know it.

14:04.668 --> 14:05.588
The other night.

14:07.109 --> 14:10.330
I had a big dream!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.871
Moco-chan's dream.

14:13.351 --> 14:16.412
It's been a little while since you had a dream, right Moco-chan?

14:17.132 --> 14:20.313
But I thought maybe you'd like to hear it.

14:21.733 --> 14:22.653
It's so funny.

14:22.673 --> 14:24.354
So the other night,

14:26.494 --> 14:29.595
I had a dream about our mamas!

14:30.395 --> 14:33.656
Both Mama Puppy and Icomochi-mama!

14:34.156 --> 14:39.397
You know, in the dream, we all went to an amusement park together!

14:39.417 --> 14:42.018
And it was really sunny!

14:42.038 --> 14:46.559
And Mama Puppy and Icomochi-mama were meeting for the first time.

14:46.579 --> 14:48.680
It was fun.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.181
You know, they both really hit it off talking, and I

14:54.914 --> 14:59.306
I was a bit envious because I wanted to talk to Icomochi-mama more too, but...

15:00.748 --> 15:02.409
Mama puppy likes to talk, huh?

15:02.449 --> 15:04.811
Mama puppy was hogging things a little bit.

15:04.891 --> 15:05.251
Yeah.

15:05.271 --> 15:11.756
But you know, before leaving the amusement park, I went with Mama puppy while Fuwawa talked to Icomochi-mama more.

15:12.157 --> 15:15.539
And I went to go buy a souvenir for Icomochi-mama.

15:15.979 --> 15:17.821
But I couldn't find anything nice.

15:18.321 --> 15:19.602
Except for some rings.

15:19.622 --> 15:21.424
I don't know why rings.

15:22.865 --> 15:27.949
Sort of weird, but... And then my dream ended without me choosing anything.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.222
But it was a really nice and sunny dream.

15:33.363 --> 15:34.344
Not a pon-de-ring.

15:34.724 --> 15:34.944
No.

15:35.364 --> 15:36.085
Shiny rings.

15:37.506 --> 15:39.248
No, I woke up and I felt happy.

15:39.268 --> 15:41.630
It was a good dream.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.430
That was a dream.

15:43.391 --> 15:43.972
Yeah.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.716
A nice dream.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.078
That was a good time with...

15:51.966 --> 15:52.846
Mama's right.

15:52.906 --> 15:53.206
Yeah.

15:53.346 --> 15:53.667
Yeah.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.047
BAU BAU!

15:56.247 --> 15:58.388
BAU BAU!

15:58.568 --> 15:59.949
Just a happy game, just a game.

15:59.989 --> 16:00.829
It's just silly.

16:01.989 --> 16:02.709
Nothing deep.

16:04.010 --> 16:09.852
Well... I guess, well, you know we talked about Mama Puppy, yeah?

16:10.172 --> 16:11.032
And Ruffians!

16:11.412 --> 16:14.913
You know how we played Thief Simulator 2 the other day, right?

16:14.973 --> 16:15.494
Right!

16:15.714 --> 16:16.654
That was really fun.

16:17.556 --> 16:18.736
Borrowing things.

16:18.796 --> 16:20.277
Borrowing stuff, huh?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.537
Getting tased.

16:22.318 --> 16:23.158
Not so fun.

16:23.178 --> 16:25.398
Not so fun, no!

16:26.519 --> 16:27.179
Yeah!

16:27.219 --> 16:35.802
Well, sometimes thieves, they wear the balaclavas to hide their identities, right?

16:35.822 --> 16:37.402
Yeah.

16:38.642 --> 16:39.083
Right.

16:40.163 --> 16:46.665
Well, actually, FUWAMOCO, we were reminded where our

16:47.355 --> 16:55.627
Maybe you could call it a bit of a trauma, but we have bad memories when we see a BAU BAU.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.934
Well, you see it.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.608
When we were misbehaving.

17:06.328 --> 17:08.229
It really didn't happen that often.

17:08.270 --> 17:10.171
We didn't misbehave much, okay?

17:10.191 --> 17:12.292
We got locked in the cell for mischief.

17:12.392 --> 17:14.694
Yeah, we don't misbehave though, okay?

17:14.754 --> 17:20.398
You know, Papa Puppy used to threaten to chase us around with a balaclava on.

17:22.259 --> 17:24.801
And we were terrified of it.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.028
Howling and running and crying is scary.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.228
Yeah.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.689
It's really, really horrible.

17:32.749 --> 17:34.929
Ruffians are so scary.

17:34.950 --> 17:39.771
Papa Puppy, you know, Papa Puppy doesn't look like Papa Puppy anymore with it on.

17:39.971 --> 17:40.431
Right!

17:40.451 --> 17:40.911
Right!

17:40.951 --> 17:41.471
Yeah.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.413
You know, I don't even have any memories of actually being chased on.

17:45.713 --> 17:48.834
It was always just the threat of putting it on that was enough.

17:49.174 --> 17:49.574
Yeah.

17:50.614 --> 17:51.915
I don't know what it is!

17:51.935 --> 17:54.196
I don't know the three weird holes.

17:54.216 --> 17:54.276
Why?

17:54.296 --> 17:55.897
It's just so upsetting.

17:56.137 --> 17:56.558
Right.

17:56.818 --> 17:58.659
There's holes and there's three of them.

17:59.039 --> 17:59.279
Yeah.

17:59.499 --> 18:01.320
But the hats don't have them.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.141
Right.

18:02.161 --> 18:03.101
I don't know.

18:03.161 --> 18:07.984
Even just seeing it afterwards, like laying down, the mask, is scary.

18:08.484 --> 18:09.405
It's scary!

18:09.425 --> 18:09.705
Yeah.

18:10.505 --> 18:11.246
Yeah.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.160
I don't know, Ruffians, do you feel the same way?

18:15.180 --> 18:17.161
Do you feel like it looks upsetting?

18:17.442 --> 18:18.923
Or is it just us?

18:19.863 --> 18:20.884
Do masks scare you?

18:20.964 --> 18:22.866
No, but these do.

18:24.307 --> 18:26.468
No, it's cold, that's why you need one.

18:26.488 --> 18:27.689
Gutsu Kawamori!

18:28.009 --> 18:28.430
No!

18:28.510 --> 18:30.111
FUWAMOCO Balaclavas!

18:30.151 --> 18:30.231
No!

18:32.302 --> 18:32.682
No!

18:33.182 --> 18:34.042
It's just us!

18:35.043 --> 18:38.663
Although I guess they're kind of fluffy and fuzzy in a way, but I definitely know it!

18:38.703 --> 18:40.284
We feel fluffy and fuzzy!

18:40.444 --> 18:40.984
No!

18:41.444 --> 18:42.024
It's just us!

18:42.084 --> 18:42.684
It's just us!

18:42.724 --> 18:44.625
Very cute childhood drama!

18:45.285 --> 18:45.865
Thank you!

18:45.905 --> 18:47.265
Thank you for the compliment!

18:50.586 --> 18:52.266
I guess we're all alone, huh?

18:52.306 --> 18:53.547
A new outfit?

18:53.667 --> 18:53.887
No!

18:55.706 --> 18:56.326
No way!

18:57.126 --> 18:59.427
Icomochi-mama, please don't get ideas.

19:01.328 --> 19:03.648
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

19:04.588 --> 19:05.569
BAU BAU.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.269
I guess it's just us then, huh?

19:07.549 --> 19:09.650
They're terrifying though, Ruffians.

19:09.730 --> 19:11.270
How do you not feel the same way?

19:11.410 --> 19:12.651
They're terrifying.

19:13.131 --> 19:14.151
Hockey masks.

19:17.725 --> 19:18.025
BAU BAU!

19:18.145 --> 19:19.846
Ruffians, you know, we're

19:46.164 --> 19:48.545
A long, long time.

19:48.565 --> 19:52.627
There's kind of been something missing on FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

19:53.588 --> 19:55.049
So... Uh, what?

19:55.109 --> 20:02.352
Well... Actually, I regret to inform you that there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

20:02.372 --> 20:14.278
Uh... Yeah... Yeah... You know... We were talking recently about good protagonists, right?

20:14.358 --> 20:14.398
Mm.

20:16.098 --> 20:16.478
Right.

20:17.599 --> 20:24.625
And one Ruffian suggested Subaru Natsuki from ReZero to join that list.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.468
And no, we promptly said NO!

20:32.219 --> 20:32.499
Yeah.

20:32.999 --> 20:39.842
Well, it seems, Ruffians, that some of you are misunderstanding that we said we didn't like ReZero.

20:40.002 --> 20:41.363
That's not what we said.

20:41.503 --> 20:42.103
No.

20:42.243 --> 20:49.106
All we said was just that Subaru Natsuki would definitely not count in our books as a favorite protagonist.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.827
That's what we said, okay?

20:50.847 --> 20:52.328
That's all!

20:52.388 --> 20:55.149
No misunderstanding, okay?

20:55.889 --> 20:56.089
Yeah.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.210
Got it.

20:57.230 --> 20:58.250
Got it on us.

20:58.511 --> 20:58.811
Right.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.651
Right, FUWAMOCO.

21:01.512 --> 21:01.772
Yeah.

21:02.625 --> 21:09.690
But... To tell the truth... We tried watching ReZero as much as we could.

21:09.710 --> 21:13.152
You know, because we were really curious about Rem and Ram.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.374
Spelled blue and pink twins.

21:15.394 --> 21:17.195
You know, it's sort of similar.

21:20.677 --> 21:21.558
We really tried.

21:21.578 --> 21:23.179
We really did.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.881
But we couldn't continue.

21:28.120 --> 21:39.528
To be honest, we kept waiting for Suwako to change, you know, maybe start changing his outlook on things because, you know, we felt like they kept on setting it up for him to have some big change or character growth.

21:39.868 --> 21:44.852
But episode after episode, it didn't happen.

21:45.352 --> 21:45.533
Nope.

21:47.574 --> 21:47.734
Nope.

21:48.735 --> 21:49.996
Do we miss the Ruffians?

21:52.841 --> 21:53.702
It doesn't happen at all.

21:53.902 --> 21:55.064
Okay, we didn't miss it.

21:55.864 --> 21:59.088
Shall we continue our mission of watching ReZero?

21:59.188 --> 21:59.649
Duh!

21:59.669 --> 22:00.149
He did.

22:00.229 --> 22:00.750
He dies.

22:00.770 --> 22:01.691
He gets better.

22:01.711 --> 22:01.751
Oh.

22:03.073 --> 22:07.338
End of Season 2, but I feel like we watched really, really far!

22:07.358 --> 22:09.700
We definitely got past the end of Season 2.

22:13.678 --> 22:14.059
Give it time?

22:14.079 --> 22:15.622
We gave it so much time!

22:15.642 --> 22:16.764
We gave it a lot of time!

22:16.784 --> 22:18.567
We gave it a lot of time!

22:18.587 --> 22:20.069
It never gets better.

22:20.109 --> 22:21.051
Okay, decided.

22:21.352 --> 22:21.892
BAU BAU!

22:25.361 --> 22:27.142
BAU BAU!

22:27.162 --> 22:27.783
Ruffians!

22:27.863 --> 22:32.946
It's time to show you a little leak!

22:33.346 --> 22:35.567
It's time to show character growth!

22:35.607 --> 22:38.409
Yup, it's the time for Moco-chan's character growth.

22:38.769 --> 22:43.052
Because she's going to come out with something that's very scary to her.

22:43.092 --> 22:44.312
Not a balaclava.

22:44.793 --> 22:47.074
She's going to eat some natto.

22:47.254 --> 22:53.097
I don't want the Ruffians to think, Oh, Mococo, she's just like Tsugubayashi Natsuki.

22:53.177 --> 22:53.978
No growth at all!

22:54.558 --> 22:58.023
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

22:58.043 --> 22:58.343
BAU BAU!

23:12.541 --> 23:13.141
On standby.

23:13.201 --> 23:14.162
It's not there yet.

23:14.402 --> 23:24.268
But for Ruffians who are just joining us, maybe for the first time today, natto is a Japanese breakfast food that consists of fermented soybeans.

23:24.368 --> 23:26.629
It's really, really healthy for you.

23:26.789 --> 23:27.870
So good for you.

23:28.550 --> 23:33.273
But it's really slimy, and sticky, and a little bit smelly.

23:33.693 --> 23:34.974
It's an SSS.

23:35.974 --> 23:36.414
No.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.255
Sorry, it's my story.

23:38.315 --> 23:38.735
No.

23:38.955 --> 23:40.596
No, stinky smell is sticky.

23:40.836 --> 23:41.276
Was that it?

23:41.616 --> 23:41.856
Yeah.

23:43.357 --> 23:43.637
Yeah.

23:44.117 --> 23:50.740
But Moco-chan's gonna do her best so that she can continue to protect your smile for many, many years to come.

23:51.060 --> 23:56.162
Just like her older sister, Fuwawa, who eats it happily every day.

23:56.182 --> 23:57.622
I wanna eat it happily.

23:57.682 --> 23:57.922
Yeah.

23:58.442 --> 24:00.083
Moco-chan, you feeling good today?

24:00.103 --> 24:01.444
You did so well last time.

24:01.464 --> 24:04.585
I was not feeling good earlier.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.446
But I'm feeling better a bit after seeing the Ruffians.

24:09.546 --> 24:09.946
I'll try.

24:09.966 --> 24:13.748
The Ruffians are gonna make Moco-chan eat a lot of natto today!

24:14.388 --> 24:17.809
Well, I'm gonna stir it up and get it all ready here.

24:17.829 --> 24:19.250
I don't have a tissue.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.890
Oh, that's because you're brave, Moco-chan.

24:21.910 --> 24:23.191
No, I need a tissue.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.531
No, you do not have a tissue.

24:24.551 --> 24:26.392
You will not be getting a tissue today.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.193
You'll just have to eat it like you did last time.

24:30.656 --> 24:32.579
Okay, it's all ready.

24:32.639 --> 24:36.705
It looks pretty nice and sticky today.

24:36.985 --> 24:44.295
But first, Moco-chan, let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard to make this natto.

24:44.315 --> 24:46.278
Thank you, farmers!

24:47.379 --> 24:47.699
Okay.

24:49.582 --> 24:53.225
It's my favorite chopsticks.

24:53.545 --> 24:55.727
Yeah, I got them just for you, Moco-chan.

24:55.907 --> 24:56.367
That's good.

24:56.567 --> 24:57.028
Yeah.

24:57.768 --> 24:59.229
Can we have a tissue?

24:59.770 --> 25:00.950
No, I can't reach it.

25:01.871 --> 25:03.432
Also, we only have four left.

25:03.512 --> 25:05.354
If I can't do this, then I'm in trouble.

25:05.374 --> 25:06.675
And you're in trouble, too.

25:08.956 --> 25:12.519
You know, Kano used up a lot of the tissues, so now we have to protect them.

25:12.999 --> 25:13.940
They're endangered.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.581
Yeah.

25:17.062 --> 25:17.302
What?

25:20.826 --> 25:22.027
It hit me!

25:22.127 --> 25:23.747
The smell, it hit me!

25:25.708 --> 25:27.629
What am I gonna do if I can't do this?

25:27.769 --> 25:28.990
You can do it, Moco-chan.

25:29.030 --> 25:30.891
Don't even think about the what if I can't.

25:31.251 --> 25:32.772
Just think of the what if I can.

25:32.792 --> 25:32.872
Yeah.

25:34.953 --> 25:37.474
Think of how proud the Ruffians will be!

25:37.494 --> 25:40.295
Poruru-oneechan will be like, Moco-chan erai yo!

25:40.315 --> 25:40.415
Right!

25:42.927 --> 25:45.588
I'm so happy, can you hear Poruru-oneechan's voice?

25:46.228 --> 25:46.908
I can!

25:49.488 --> 25:52.029
Recently she said, FUWAMOCO daisuki.

25:52.269 --> 25:53.129
And I was happy.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.050
So I think of Poruru-oneechan saying daisuki dayo.

26:01.650 --> 26:03.911
Okay, Moco-chan has one natto.

26:04.691 --> 26:06.611
One natto bean in the chopsticks.

26:08.852 --> 26:09.412
Okay.

26:11.229 --> 26:11.549
Okay.

26:11.569 --> 26:14.390
Here you go, Moco-chan.

26:15.591 --> 26:17.952
The chopsticks are so sticky, I just want to drop it.

26:19.393 --> 26:20.313
Then just do that.

26:21.074 --> 26:21.694
Like a popcorn.

26:25.805 --> 26:26.465
Okay!

26:26.945 --> 26:28.366
Here you go, Moco-chan!

26:29.406 --> 26:29.486
Five!

26:29.546 --> 26:30.586
Four!

26:30.606 --> 26:32.406
Can you pass me the water?

26:32.426 --> 26:33.987
I don't have a tissue.

26:34.087 --> 26:35.427
I don't have tea.

26:35.527 --> 26:36.547
I need something.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.067
You'll be good.

26:38.167 --> 26:39.308
Just do it.

26:39.808 --> 26:40.228
Five!

26:40.848 --> 26:41.348
Four!

26:41.968 --> 26:42.668
Three!

26:43.148 --> 26:43.888
Two!

26:44.869 --> 26:45.109
One!

26:45.469 --> 26:45.869
Oh!

26:46.209 --> 26:47.929
Oh, she did it, she did it, she did it!

26:47.949 --> 26:48.709
You can do it, Moco-chan!

26:48.809 --> 26:49.189
Keep on going!

26:49.329 --> 26:50.170
Keep on going!

26:50.830 --> 26:50.990
Oh!

26:51.610 --> 26:51.710
Oh!

26:52.739 --> 26:55.081
She did it!

26:55.641 --> 26:57.302
I didn't really chew it though.

26:57.562 --> 26:58.883
No, she chewed it.

27:02.906 --> 27:04.107
Don't cry, Moco-chan.

27:19.349 --> 27:20.109
Another bean?

27:20.149 --> 27:21.730
We should do another bean!

27:21.750 --> 27:24.710
Yeah, you can do it, Moco-chan!

27:30.051 --> 27:31.272
How was it this time?

27:31.692 --> 27:32.672
You did it!

27:33.212 --> 27:35.553
You're averaging one bean every time now.

27:36.713 --> 27:37.313
Right!

27:40.394 --> 27:41.674
So I have a cough drop.

27:42.498 --> 27:44.460
Maya, Moco-chan, you did it!

27:45.581 --> 27:47.163
I'm feeling sweaty now!

27:47.303 --> 27:48.605
No, no, no, no!

27:48.665 --> 27:50.386
No more!

27:50.426 --> 27:53.430
Put some sesame oil on and then you can try to rest.

27:54.050 --> 27:54.431
No!

27:56.313 --> 27:57.234
Cough drop time.

27:59.199 --> 28:05.188
Wow, Ruffians are getting to the point where Moco-chan can eat one natto bean every time.

28:05.208 --> 28:08.433
That's pretty amazing in it's own way.

28:08.453 --> 28:09.354
Improvement.

28:09.755 --> 28:14.041
I already have more character growth than Subaru Natsuki, okay?

28:15.728 --> 28:20.150
Ruffians, make sure to challenge yourself to something new this week too, okay?

28:20.170 --> 28:23.151
BAU BAU!

28:24.391 --> 28:27.352
Next we have our Doggie of the Day!

28:27.832 --> 28:32.754
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Jack-Jack!

28:32.774 --> 28:37.936
Look how sophisticated this puppy is with those glasses!

28:38.316 --> 28:39.896
The red frame glasses!

28:39.936 --> 28:41.457
Very nice!

28:42.125 --> 28:43.266
So stylish!

28:43.386 --> 28:44.347
So cute!

28:44.847 --> 28:46.108
I love it!

28:46.488 --> 28:52.073
And as every puppy is, Jack-Jack loves to play too!

28:52.173 --> 28:52.894
Cute!

28:53.954 --> 28:55.616
I love the sprites.

28:55.776 --> 28:56.436
Oh right!

28:56.476 --> 28:58.058
You wanna poke them, right?

28:58.078 --> 28:58.378
Yeah!

28:58.418 --> 28:58.938
Count them!

28:59.019 --> 29:00.019
Poke, poke, poke.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.461
Sprite, sprite, sprite, sprite.

29:03.002 --> 29:03.902
Oh right!

29:04.403 --> 29:07.305
Well, how does Jack-Jack BAU BAU?

29:07.746 --> 29:08.226
BAU BAU!

29:08.666 --> 29:09.847
BAU BAU!

29:11.108 --> 29:11.708
BAU BAU!

29:11.728 --> 29:14.729
I think that's exactly it.

29:14.789 --> 29:15.849
You only have to try.

29:15.869 --> 29:17.209
I don't even have to try.

29:17.469 --> 29:18.029
You got it.

29:18.830 --> 29:19.230
Right.

29:20.030 --> 29:21.490
We should wear glasses.

29:21.990 --> 29:23.391
Jack-Jack feels like a dad.

29:23.431 --> 29:24.311
No, he's a puppy.

29:24.451 --> 29:27.171
I'm not gonna steal Jack-Jack's glasses, okay?

29:27.191 --> 29:28.652
That wouldn't be very nice.

29:29.092 --> 29:31.232
You can't steal stuff from a puppy, okay?

29:31.412 --> 29:32.772
Yeah, that would be bad.

29:33.553 --> 29:38.794
Well, you know, Jack-Jack is a very big cutie with a passion for glasses.

29:40.214 --> 29:46.642
He's still just a puppy, but he's already doing an amazing job at making you and all your family smile!

29:46.742 --> 29:47.383
Cheers!

29:49.497 --> 29:57.362
I think I know, but he's looking forward to playing lots and lots more together with you for many years to come.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.963
BAU BAU!

29:59.063 --> 30:05.347
Well, next I have on today I went on a walk.

30:05.867 --> 30:07.848
I'm going to be going Ruffians.

30:07.988 --> 30:11.490
De-den!

30:12.211 --> 30:13.912
You went on a mountain climb?

30:13.932 --> 30:16.934
At late night.

30:16.994 --> 30:18.174
Please be careful!

30:18.735 --> 30:18.915
But...

30:20.174 --> 30:21.456
The view is nice, huh?

30:21.496 --> 30:21.836
Right?

30:21.916 --> 30:23.418
So many lights.

30:23.478 --> 30:24.259
Romantic.

30:24.360 --> 30:29.366
You say it's a little cloudy, but we still think that's a pretty beautiful view.

30:29.427 --> 30:29.627
Right?

30:29.647 --> 30:31.229
What do you think, Ruffians?

30:31.249 --> 30:33.552
You can see so much!

30:33.572 --> 30:34.874
It's so beautiful.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.929
Right, so pretty.

30:38.409 --> 30:40.431
Oh, it makes you miss your home.

30:40.791 --> 30:41.151
Right?

30:41.312 --> 30:48.017
I don't know, it just feels so familiar, but... I'm glad you had a great time.

30:48.237 --> 30:54.202
But please, please, make sure to be safe and let your loved ones know before you go out on a long hike.

30:54.283 --> 30:55.744
Especially at night, okay?

30:55.764 --> 30:56.084
Right!

30:56.104 --> 30:58.346
You know, safety is always important, okay?

30:58.466 --> 30:59.727
Number one.

30:59.767 --> 31:00.888
We want you to be safe.

31:01.068 --> 31:01.389
Yeah.

31:02.169 --> 31:05.430
BAU BAU!

31:05.611 --> 31:09.612
Next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

31:09.852 --> 31:15.095
Hello Fuwawa, hello Mococo!

31:15.195 --> 31:23.658
Following up from McConnell once again, are you girls the type to have multiple alarms and hit snooze for a while, or do you get up after only one of them?

31:23.678 --> 31:27.780
Do you have multiple alarm clocks to maintain your impeccable streaming schedule?

31:28.300 --> 31:30.142
Thank you!

31:30.162 --> 31:30.742
Thank you!

31:30.902 --> 31:33.124
I do have multiple alarm clocks.

31:33.244 --> 31:33.625
I know.

31:33.905 --> 31:35.366
We really like collecting them.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.290
Sort of like Naegi, but we just don't really use them.

31:40.475 --> 31:43.556
Moco-chan's alarm is really quiet.

31:43.596 --> 31:44.396
Mine is really loud.

31:44.416 --> 31:45.597
I checked all my settings.

31:45.617 --> 31:46.477
I don't know what it is.

31:46.517 --> 31:47.378
Can't figure it out why.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.883
It happens, but at least it works right now.

32:02.003 --> 32:09.547
You know, I kind of like to put my phone in between my mattress and the side of the bunk bed.

32:09.727 --> 32:13.970
And you know, that way it shakes the entire structure and it just, it sounds horrible.

32:14.030 --> 32:14.930
It really does.

32:15.671 --> 32:17.211
But it works well!

32:17.672 --> 32:20.093
You know, at first, after we debuted,

32:20.573 --> 32:26.298
It was hard to sleep for a long time, because you know we were really terrified of oversleeping a stream.

32:26.318 --> 32:29.621
But you know, I think we've gotten used to things now!

32:29.641 --> 32:31.903
And still no oversleeping!

32:31.923 --> 32:33.464
So it's good.

32:33.604 --> 32:36.247
We don't really hit the snooze that much either, I don't think.

32:38.408 --> 32:40.130
Moco-chan hit the snooze today, but...

32:42.374 --> 32:44.275
BAU BAU!

32:45.335 --> 32:49.497
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for always being a part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

32:49.937 --> 33:00.922
It's really so special to us, so thank you for all your questions, your doggy of the days, your walks, your Pero Sightings, and your FUWAMOCO scoops, too!

33:00.962 --> 33:04.084
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

33:04.784 --> 33:05.544
Wow.

33:05.744 --> 33:08.806
Moco-chan, we have another stream coming up, right?

33:09.426 --> 33:11.367
Next, we have...

33:17.591 --> 33:26.316
Well today, you know, FUWAMOCO are going to be doing a bunch of recording, homework, and maybe a little bit of rest too if we can.

33:26.797 --> 33:29.078
So wish us luck, okay Ruffians?

33:30.059 --> 33:32.260
You do your best too, okay?

33:32.300 --> 33:36.382
But tomorrow, we'll be seeing our doggy pack for

33:38.533 --> 33:42.577
A little bit of a chat and a little bit of a clean up time.

33:42.777 --> 33:52.587
You know, as we clean up our downloads, I have 13,000 files in my downloads folder and over 600 folders.

33:53.027 --> 33:54.449
So things are sort of hidden.

33:54.469 --> 33:56.431
I need to clean them up.

33:56.891 --> 33:58.052
I can't find the stuff.

33:59.794 --> 34:00.735
So we're gonna have a

34:01.275 --> 34:04.718
A nice time partying up while chatting to yourself.

34:04.778 --> 34:06.619
BAU BAU!

34:06.760 --> 34:09.262
Mama Lucy, you got Ruffians!

34:10.362 --> 34:15.707
And well for our schedule, this week we have a number of exciting things coming up.

34:15.767 --> 34:18.008
A lot of recordings for FUWAMOCO.

34:18.209 --> 34:23.133
But on the weekend, we're gonna be starting Metal Gear Solid 2 on PS2!

34:23.333 --> 34:24.394
Our first time!

34:24.654 --> 34:26.035
First time we have our

34:28.957 --> 34:30.959
PS2 memory cards!

34:31.139 --> 34:31.900
We do it!

34:32.440 --> 34:32.920
We do it!

34:33.020 --> 34:33.841
I'm all ready.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.723
Controllers too.

34:36.163 --> 34:36.283
Yup.

34:36.323 --> 34:37.844
We're all good to go.

34:38.105 --> 34:39.586
No problems this time.

34:40.206 --> 34:40.867
Yeah.

34:40.887 --> 34:45.791
So we hope you'll join us and, uh, well, hopefully we get the hang of the sneak in part, right?

34:46.251 --> 34:46.772
BAU BAU!

34:47.312 --> 34:49.274
BAU BAU!

34:51.435 --> 34:56.956
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:56.996 --> 34:57.416
Thank you!

34:57.496 --> 35:02.857
Our 71st episode, and you know, before we know it, we're gonna blink and we'll be at the 80th episode too!

35:02.937 --> 35:04.898
I feel like we're gonna blink and we're gonna be at 100!

35:05.098 --> 35:05.378
Right?

35:05.418 --> 35:07.858
Thank you, Ruffians!

35:07.958 --> 35:08.558
Thank you!

35:08.598 --> 35:16.920
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

35:16.940 --> 35:17.040
Yay!

35:19.958 --> 35:22.560

35:22.860 --> 35:24.501

35:33.387 --> 35:34.148

35:34.528 --> 35:35.949

35:41.713 --> 35:51.219
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

35:51.239 --> 35:55.241
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:55.281 --> 35:56.782
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

35:56.822 --> 35:57.222
BAU BAU!
