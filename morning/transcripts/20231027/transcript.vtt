05:09.300 --> 05:11.698
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:11.758 --> 05:16.060
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.080 --> 05:25.564
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:27.284 --> 05:27.765
BAU!

05:29.265 --> 05:32.147
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.468
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:35.588 --> 05:37.609
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:40.862 --> 05:45.525
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:46.225 --> 05:46.426
Yes.

05:46.866 --> 05:47.106
Yes.

05:48.847 --> 05:55.371
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 37th episode.

05:55.391 --> 05:55.371
37!

05:55.871 --> 05:56.111
Huh?

05:56.391 --> 05:58.052
That's almost the whole human life.

05:58.072 --> 06:00.754
37 years is almost a full spooky.

06:08.143 --> 06:08.543
BAU BAU!

06:09.004 --> 06:10.145
BAU BAU!

06:10.165 --> 06:11.666
I don't really get it.

06:11.686 --> 06:13.488
37 times 2.

06:13.708 --> 06:13.988
Or 3.

06:16.690 --> 06:17.271
Spooky.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.872
3 if we do our best.

06:19.593 --> 06:20.714
The humans do our best.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.016
Yeah.

06:24.217 --> 06:24.837
Ruffians.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.118
I see a few Ruffians.

06:27.568 --> 06:29.429
It might be the first FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:29.449 --> 06:31.911
Maybe it's the first time you woke up early.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.211
It's nice to meet you.

06:33.231 --> 06:45.219
To explain about FUWAMOCO Morning, it's a short format morning show that is held every Friday to this Wednesday and Monday.

06:45.299 --> 06:46.860
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

06:46.960 --> 06:47.580
Makes sense.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.941
And it's hosted by us!

06:49.461 --> 06:51.062
FUWAMOCO!

06:51.082 --> 06:57.565
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:58.005 --> 07:00.006
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

07:00.826 --> 07:01.367
Hashtag.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.327
FWMCMORNING.

07:03.407 --> 07:04.448
It's not funny!

07:04.748 --> 07:05.408
It's funny.

07:05.428 --> 07:06.309
It's not.

07:06.769 --> 07:08.550
I'm saying the hashtag.

07:09.350 --> 07:10.411
Hashtag this.

07:11.651 --> 07:12.892
Is it necessary though?

07:12.952 --> 07:13.352
It is.

07:14.853 --> 07:15.953
It's not a bit funny.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.034
It is not funny.

07:18.115 --> 07:19.076
Very serious.

07:20.037 --> 07:21.538
Wow, let's ignore that.

07:22.079 --> 07:25.982
And all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:26.002 --> 07:26.923
BAU BAU!

07:26.963 --> 07:30.246
Oh, Ruffians.

07:30.286 --> 07:31.247
Did you ignore it?

07:31.928 --> 07:33.689
It's been a bit of a busy week.

07:34.470 --> 07:35.631
Bit of a spooky week.

07:36.272 --> 07:39.134
And you know, Halloween's just right around the corner.

07:39.977 --> 07:43.420
But, I don't know, what's Pero off doing?

07:43.620 --> 07:44.521
Oh, who knows?

07:44.561 --> 07:45.221
Who cares?

07:45.321 --> 07:46.142
Have you seen him?

07:47.543 --> 07:53.407
I think one Ruffian saw him!

07:55.229 --> 07:55.789
De-den.

07:56.350 --> 08:01.834
It looks like this Ruffian came across some inspiration while they were busy carving pumpkins for Halloween.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.436
It looks nice.

08:04.556 --> 08:04.816
Right?

08:04.916 --> 08:06.417
I think it turned out great.

08:08.139 --> 08:08.299
What?

08:08.874 --> 08:10.615
Pero didn't get in the way though, right?

08:11.255 --> 08:14.716
Especially when you use all the sharp knives to cut the pumpkin.

08:15.876 --> 08:20.018
You know, sometimes Pero can get a little bit mysterious.

08:20.398 --> 08:22.979
A little bit mischievous and mysterious.

08:23.619 --> 08:25.440
She's got knives and everything.

08:28.124 --> 08:33.066
I'm glad it was okay though, but you know, yeah, you finished the pumpkin!

08:33.146 --> 08:33.727
Yeah!

08:33.847 --> 08:37.728
It looks amazing and I think all your fingers are still attached.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.389
Hopefully!

08:38.409 --> 08:41.010
I think the Ruffian would have let us know, right?

08:41.070 --> 08:41.290
Maybe.

08:42.795 --> 08:48.638
You know, you really got Pero's ears there and the wings and the horns too!

08:48.878 --> 08:53.101
Actually, I think Pero kind of looks a bit proud of your pumpkin, you know?

08:53.221 --> 08:54.122
A bit proud, yeah.

08:54.142 --> 08:54.822
A bit smug.

08:54.842 --> 09:00.485
It seems like it rubbed his ego just in the right spot by having his very own pumpkin.

09:00.505 --> 09:00.846
Right.

09:00.886 --> 09:05.789
Maybe he feels like it's sort of like a statue of him or like

09:06.509 --> 09:06.950
It's a pumpkin.

09:16.602 --> 09:17.883
It's just a pumpkin.

09:18.003 --> 09:19.824
It's not a statue.

09:20.324 --> 09:28.730
Well, you know, as long as Pero's in a good mood and he's not messing with you, I guess it's okay, right?

09:28.930 --> 09:31.231
All's well that ends well, right?

09:31.952 --> 09:35.474
We'd really like to see what the pumpkin looks like all lit up, too.

09:35.514 --> 09:36.575
Oh yeah!

09:36.715 --> 09:37.155
At night!

09:38.596 --> 09:40.097
Have a happy Halloween!

09:40.217 --> 09:41.138
Halloween!

09:41.218 --> 09:43.139
BAU BAU!

09:43.559 --> 09:44.079
Halloween!

09:44.119 --> 09:44.800
Halloween!

09:45.380 --> 09:46.981
Hello Halloween, BAU BAU!

09:47.001 --> 09:49.142
BAU BAU!

09:49.182 --> 09:50.983
BAU BAU!

09:51.583 --> 09:52.464
I'm Ruffians!

09:53.104 --> 09:54.525
On the topic of Halloween.

09:55.765 --> 09:58.147
If you didn't know it, we have.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.908
We're asking something of you.

10:01.188 --> 10:01.729
We are.

10:03.089 --> 10:03.790
Ruffians.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.803
You're gonna join us for Halloween, right?

10:07.143 --> 10:07.844
Right!

10:08.444 --> 10:14.107
And we're gonna share some spooky stories together with you, right?

10:14.668 --> 10:15.888
But not just any stories.

10:15.948 --> 10:16.168
No!

10:16.629 --> 10:18.430
Those stories will be written by you!

10:18.610 --> 10:19.510
Yeah!

10:19.550 --> 10:22.832
Well, I guess most of them, right?

10:22.852 --> 10:28.235
Because maybe we'll write some too, but the spookiest part

10:29.670 --> 10:31.976
You won't know if it was us or not, hai!

10:32.096 --> 10:33.680
Which one is us, hai!

10:38.313 --> 10:43.515
Well, you can submit your stories to us through our Google Form, which is in the description below.

10:43.775 --> 10:44.816
Just look down a bit, okay?

10:44.836 --> 10:46.696
Just look a little bit down.

10:46.896 --> 10:54.099
But we'd like to ask you to write completely original stories that are around 250 to 1,000 words in length.

10:54.299 --> 10:57.961
Don't worry if it's a bit over 1,000.

10:58.021 --> 10:58.641
A bit under.

10:59.001 --> 11:00.682
It's okay.

11:00.942 --> 11:03.583
Yeah, we're not gonna take a grade off or anything.

11:03.623 --> 11:03.683
No!

11:04.623 --> 11:05.544
We're not your teacher.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.588
But there's other things that we'd like you to be mindful of too.

11:09.928 --> 11:13.872
That they don't contain any characters or properties from other IPs.

11:13.912 --> 11:16.114
But hololive is okay, the original characters are good.

11:16.354 --> 11:18.015
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:18.216 --> 11:22.499
And that they don't have any offensive content either.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.441
Easy to team, okay?

11:25.781 --> 11:30.164
But it also, it really really needs to be completely original, okay?

11:30.684 --> 11:34.906
We want you Ruffians to have written it, not anyone else that defeats the point.

11:35.007 --> 11:36.327
Defeats the point.

11:36.707 --> 11:41.370
Yeah, but there could be like silly and spooky stories that actually happen to you too.

11:41.470 --> 11:43.611
Or maybe ones that are just in your head.

11:43.631 --> 11:48.054
But you know, anything that helps you get writing a little bit.

11:49.054 --> 11:51.956
We're looking forward to sharing stories all together on a

11:52.947 --> 11:55.410
Special first Halloween night together!

11:55.430 --> 11:58.033
BAU BAU!

12:00.115 --> 12:02.698
Well, Halloween stuff doesn't quite end there.

12:02.718 --> 12:10.367
We have... In case you missed it... The Manor!

12:11.248 --> 12:12.069
Ruffians!

12:12.848 --> 12:14.029
Spooky stories, huh?

12:14.089 --> 12:19.473
You had a chance to listen to our very first vocal dramas all together with Advent, right?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.314
Yeah, the manners!

12:21.674 --> 12:22.875
You haven't forgotten, right?

12:24.456 --> 12:24.756
Yeah.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.158
Yes, yes, good!

12:28.278 --> 12:34.583
It's a spooky voice drama that us and Advent participated in as part of the Advent Halloween Party!

12:34.663 --> 12:40.847
We weren't our usual FUWAMOCO self that you know us as, but we were two maid sisters!

12:41.522 --> 12:43.087
Maria and Aria.

12:43.368 --> 12:44.772
Not Cuban dog sisters!

12:44.913 --> 12:45.073
No!

12:46.892 --> 12:51.275
If you haven't had a chance to check it out yet, you can find it on the hololive store!

12:51.555 --> 12:55.498
We'd love it if you could have a listen to it while it's still spooky to you.

12:56.038 --> 13:04.444
Also, Advent has some extra spooky and cool t-shirts and apparel on sale right now as well.

13:05.025 --> 13:07.386
You can find that over on Amazon!

13:07.446 --> 13:11.969
Bit of a different place, but this time just search up hololive production to find them.

13:13.368 --> 13:13.528
BAU BAU!

13:39.935 --> 13:43.193
Halloween's gonna be over soon, but...

13:43.868 --> 13:46.829
There's also something else very big coming up.

13:46.889 --> 13:47.989
Very important!

13:48.029 --> 13:48.469
You know what?

13:49.189 --> 13:55.371
Right after Halloween is the yearly hololive Sports Festival!

13:55.411 --> 13:59.052
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

13:59.732 --> 14:02.552
We're participating on the Red B Team!

14:02.632 --> 14:03.233
Red Team!

14:03.253 --> 14:11.394
And we're together with Aki-senpai, Mel-senpai, Aoi, Ina-senpai, and Calli-senpai!

14:11.755 --> 14:12.815
We're very excited.

14:14.338 --> 14:16.159
Very, very excited Ruffians!

14:16.499 --> 14:19.942
I, Jimmy Kinaflames, you're excited for that, huh?

14:20.802 --> 14:23.244
Well, I'm excited because it's gonna be fun!

14:23.384 --> 14:31.009
And we're really happy to have this opportunity, but... It's also a bit nerve-wracking.

14:31.249 --> 14:32.990
Yeah, we're nervous.

14:33.190 --> 14:35.872
We're gonna do our best to make our senpai proud!

14:36.412 --> 14:39.294
But we also hope that Lady Luck is on our side too.

14:42.469 --> 14:45.070
Going to make sure to practice as much as we can!

14:46.011 --> 14:48.172
To get a bit more used to Minecraft.

14:48.892 --> 14:53.375
It'll also be our first sports day ever, so... Lots of firsts.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.876
A lot of firsts, yeah.

14:55.556 --> 15:00.479
Is there anything you think we should look out or know in particular, Ruffians?

15:01.303 --> 15:06.567
Look out for... You know, like, oh, this senpai, this is a bit tricky for them.

15:06.607 --> 15:07.947
I think it might be tricky for FUWAMOCO.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.428
Or like, Minecraft is this.

15:10.669 --> 15:12.130
Practice in front of the Ruffians.

15:12.310 --> 15:13.151
Okay!

15:13.791 --> 15:15.132
Are you sure you want that?

15:15.152 --> 15:18.114
Don't use controller, but I don't think Minecraft works.

15:18.174 --> 15:19.115
No, no controller.

15:19.155 --> 15:20.336
You have to use keyboard.

15:20.696 --> 15:23.478
Like, oh, that's not much we can do about that.

15:23.738 --> 15:24.639
Out of our control.

15:24.659 --> 15:25.619
Double W for dash.

15:28.456 --> 15:29.657
Ah, yes, yes, yes!

15:29.777 --> 15:31.258
I learned that the other day again!

15:31.419 --> 15:32.880
Yeah!

15:33.180 --> 15:34.661
I have to write down the controls.

15:34.942 --> 15:36.823
I pray for no server issues.

15:37.043 --> 15:39.125
I'll do that too.

15:41.627 --> 15:43.228
Lots to look out for.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.550
Well, we're going to do our best!

15:45.731 --> 15:49.314
So please cheer for the red team lots and lots, okay?

15:49.694 --> 15:52.897
And especially for us Minecraft newbies, okay?

15:53.397 --> 15:55.399
Cheer for us, for FUWAMOCO, okay?

15:56.977 --> 15:59.938
Let's bring victory to the red team!

15:59.978 --> 16:00.858
Red team!

16:00.938 --> 16:02.539
BAU BAU!

16:02.559 --> 16:03.179
Red team!

16:03.239 --> 16:03.819
BAU BAU!

16:03.839 --> 16:04.779
We should make a cheer.

16:05.099 --> 16:05.620
We should.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.320
Lots of things to prepare.

16:09.561 --> 16:12.801
BAU BAU!

16:14.922 --> 16:18.143
Ruffians!

16:19.023 --> 16:21.724
Maybe we have something to confess.

16:21.804 --> 16:22.604
A confession.

16:22.624 --> 16:24.905
To confess about FUWAMOCO Morning!

16:28.965 --> 16:31.507
I don't know if the Ruffians are gonna be happy to hear this.

16:31.527 --> 16:34.250
Do you have any ideas what it could be?

16:34.270 --> 16:34.310
No.

16:39.695 --> 16:40.055
No?

16:40.776 --> 16:41.256
Well...

16:44.056 --> 16:49.000
It's not about how, you know, this is supposed to be a short format show.

16:49.040 --> 16:49.380
Right.

16:49.500 --> 16:53.404
And yet it always seems to be somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes.

16:53.464 --> 16:53.944
Right.

16:54.084 --> 16:54.965
It's not that.

16:54.985 --> 16:56.066
Uh-uh, it's not that.

16:56.246 --> 17:01.630
You know, it's not that, you know, we see Ruffians saying that it's hard to watch it all before school or work.

17:01.670 --> 17:01.990
No.

17:02.191 --> 17:03.431
It's not so short.

17:03.512 --> 17:03.552
No.

17:03.952 --> 17:04.352
No.

17:04.472 --> 17:04.692
No.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.102
We're still working on it, I bet.

17:08.122 --> 17:09.942
We're still working on that.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.903
20 minutes, 20 minutes just to go on.

17:12.324 --> 17:24.949
But, actually, at first, FUWAMOCO Morning, it was planned to be every single day of the work week.

17:25.929 --> 17:27.190
Every weekday.

17:27.710 --> 17:28.551
Everyone.

17:28.651 --> 17:30.271
Can you imagine that?

17:31.412 --> 17:33.593
How would you feel about that, Ruffians?

17:34.534 --> 17:37.897
Every day of the work week.

17:37.937 --> 17:38.657
The weekdays.

17:40.759 --> 17:41.319
Right.

17:44.562 --> 17:45.222
But you know what?

17:45.943 --> 17:48.305
I don't know if we'd be able to survive that.

17:49.145 --> 17:49.726
Yeah.

17:49.806 --> 17:51.467
We definitely couldn't handle it alone.

17:52.308 --> 17:53.869
But maybe there's a team.

17:53.969 --> 17:57.151
A team like a FUWAMOCO Morning production team.

17:57.171 --> 17:57.412
Yeah.

17:58.312 --> 17:59.673
I don't know when we'd sleep.

18:01.573 --> 18:02.614
It would be too much.

18:02.874 --> 18:06.555
Ruffians, if it was daily, what do you think it would be like?

18:07.676 --> 18:09.277
Would we have new corners?

18:09.637 --> 18:13.279
Like a FUWAMOCO live sleep camera?

18:14.019 --> 18:15.860
I don't think YouTube would be happy with that.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.020
No, I don't think so.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.962
Do you think we'd be able to wake up every day for it?

18:20.962 --> 18:23.984
Maybe it's best that it's only three days a week?

18:24.944 --> 18:25.504
I think so.

18:27.765 --> 18:29.726
You want a live sleep camera?

18:32.725 --> 18:33.145
Guests.

18:33.606 --> 18:36.528
Guests and crew.

18:36.548 --> 18:42.912
30 Minute Natto Challenge!

18:43.092 --> 18:45.774
That's like natto prison for Moco-chan.

18:45.794 --> 18:48.456
Do they sound more healthy?

18:48.676 --> 18:50.337
I think so too.

18:50.778 --> 18:53.339
I'm happy for the FUWAMOCO of the past.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.001
Great choices were made.

18:57.697 --> 18:59.257
Oh, that would be rough, right?

18:59.317 --> 19:00.258
Ruffians.

19:00.778 --> 19:02.478
Do you think you could deal with that?

19:04.819 --> 19:08.020
It's great being every Friday, Wednesday, Monday, right?

19:10.020 --> 19:11.100
FUWAMOCO.

19:11.300 --> 19:11.960
Exactly.

19:13.241 --> 19:15.681
Fits all to the timeline.

19:15.961 --> 19:20.122
It's too much!

19:20.463 --> 19:22.023
Well then, it's good that it's like this.

19:22.043 --> 19:22.863
It's good!

19:23.023 --> 19:23.823
Good for us!

19:23.863 --> 19:24.764
Good for the Ruffians.

19:25.204 --> 19:26.384
I'm glad, I'm glad.

19:28.213 --> 19:34.475
I thought for sure the Ruffians would be like... We missed it!

19:34.515 --> 19:34.935
Right?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.855
It was good.

19:38.155 --> 19:41.156
BAU BAU!

19:41.176 --> 19:46.417
Now, this is very important, Ruffians.

19:46.517 --> 19:46.917
Important?

19:47.277 --> 19:49.058
It's very important!

19:49.538 --> 19:50.458
That's true.

19:50.978 --> 19:53.639
Maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding.

19:55.720 --> 20:01.785
I think, you know, there's something that's kind of stuck in the Ruffians' minds because it's a bit unpleasant.

20:02.905 --> 20:03.166
Right?

20:04.046 --> 20:07.789
And maybe it's become a bit of a misunderstanding too.

20:10.111 --> 20:14.654
So, I mentioned it yesterday on Twitter, okay?

20:15.655 --> 20:20.939
But you know, I saw some Ruffians trying to make Rat King tea.

20:22.571 --> 20:25.493
But you aren't doing it properly!

20:25.513 --> 20:27.514
And you know that's bad.

20:27.534 --> 20:30.816
You're gonna hurt yourself and we don't want that.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.337
Okay.

20:34.318 --> 20:40.001
It's very important that the only thing that touches the teabag is hot water.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.562
That's the first step, okay?

20:43.186 --> 20:45.407
No, the teabags don't have to be moldy.

20:45.447 --> 20:48.028
They won't get moldy if you do it properly, okay?

20:48.528 --> 20:52.009
They don't touch anything except hot water.

20:52.389 --> 20:55.770
So, no milk, no sugar, nothing.

20:56.211 --> 20:56.571
Okay?

20:57.231 --> 20:58.951
Nothing touches the teabag.

20:59.532 --> 21:00.292
Just water.

21:01.592 --> 21:02.093
Got it?

21:04.353 --> 21:05.654
Now, next.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.704
You have to squeeze it out after you're done with it.

21:09.724 --> 21:10.004
Squeeze.

21:10.044 --> 21:10.525
Yeah.

21:10.605 --> 21:13.829
So you get all the tea back in the cup.

21:14.369 --> 21:16.672
Okay, so then the teabag should be dry.

21:17.593 --> 21:18.154
Got it!

21:18.474 --> 21:20.817
You can't let it sit in a pool of tea.

21:21.618 --> 21:21.999
Uh-uh.

21:22.519 --> 21:23.481
It has to be dry.

21:26.038 --> 21:28.239
You can't just put it on the dish, okay?

21:28.359 --> 21:28.539
No.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.000
It has to be dry.

21:30.860 --> 21:31.680
Now, food!

21:32.681 --> 21:33.661
Each tea bag!

21:34.182 --> 21:37.723
They need to be spaced out on their own so they can properly dry.

21:40.284 --> 21:43.866
Just so you know, I'm not giving you a tutorial, okay?

21:43.906 --> 21:46.467
This is my rat king tea, okay?

21:46.507 --> 21:47.968
Moco-chan's recipe, okay?

21:47.988 --> 21:49.908
I just don't want you to hurt yourself!

21:52.089 --> 21:53.490
They have to properly dry like that.

21:53.530 --> 21:55.191
They can't be touching, okay?

21:56.526 --> 22:00.291
And finally, they can't keep sitting there for too long.

22:00.311 --> 22:01.472
I'd say.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.736
Maybe a week maximum.

22:04.756 --> 22:05.337
Maximum.

22:05.357 --> 22:06.238
They don't mold.

22:06.318 --> 22:07.840
I've never had issues with mold.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.622
Not in the Northwest Passage.

22:09.642 --> 22:11.264
They don't mold, okay?

22:12.505 --> 22:14.367
But with that, the weak rule.

22:14.387 --> 22:15.909
More than anything.

22:18.024 --> 22:22.547
It's that I don't like having the used teabags sitting out from where I can see them.

22:23.347 --> 22:23.927
That's the issue.

22:23.967 --> 22:24.988
They just don't look very nice.

22:25.028 --> 22:26.329
They don't look nice, no.

22:27.229 --> 22:30.131
But this way, I've never had issues with mold.

22:30.471 --> 22:31.832
My tummy's never hurt.

22:32.032 --> 22:32.392
Nothing.

22:33.013 --> 22:33.413
It's good.

22:33.573 --> 22:33.933
Okay.

22:34.814 --> 22:37.876
It's just resourceful to get another teacup out of the teabags.

22:38.756 --> 22:39.196
Got it.

22:39.216 --> 22:42.538
Write that down.

22:43.039 --> 22:43.999
Don't write that down.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.640
It's not a tutorial.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.061
Just don't hurt yourself.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.003
Good kids don't copy Moco-chan, right?

22:53.524 --> 22:55.065
You're not gonna hurt yourself, right?

22:55.645 --> 22:56.466
No sugar.

22:56.846 --> 22:57.466
No milk.

22:57.987 --> 22:58.387
Okay.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.807
You do that after.

23:01.228 --> 23:01.548
After.

23:01.568 --> 23:04.150
Understood.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.310
Understood.

23:05.330 --> 23:06.011
Good, good.

23:06.091 --> 23:07.412
It's not a tutorial!

23:07.472 --> 23:09.072
Not a tutorial!

23:11.314 --> 23:12.754
Just buy more tea bags.

23:16.096 --> 23:17.277
Easier said than done.

23:19.212 --> 23:20.693
Do you understand Ruffians?

23:22.455 --> 23:25.157
Do you still have a problem with Moco-chan's habits?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.983
My tummy hurts when it's scary, okay?

23:33.264 --> 23:35.686
Not because of the rat king tea, right?

23:36.487 --> 23:37.088
Yes!

23:40.250 --> 23:41.011
No, not really.

23:41.031 --> 23:42.813
It's good to be honest.

23:46.283 --> 23:48.604
If it makes her happy, dot dot dot.

23:49.104 --> 23:50.685
It's just resourceful, okay?

23:51.525 --> 23:52.746
I won't try it, but got it.

23:53.186 --> 23:54.206
That's the spirit!

23:54.386 --> 23:54.907
Alright.

23:54.947 --> 23:56.867
Just understand, okay?

23:57.107 --> 24:04.050
I don't know if the Ruffians quite understand it yet, Moco-chan, but... It's time for Mococo to stop.

24:06.231 --> 24:06.891
Stop?

24:08.272 --> 24:11.973
Stop, Moco-chan?

24:13.454 --> 24:14.294
Big sigh.

24:18.763 --> 24:20.104
Not Mococo.

24:21.045 --> 24:21.305
No.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.547
Better stop.

24:24.788 --> 24:25.668
Please stop.

24:25.849 --> 24:27.210
Dot, dot, dot.

24:29.892 --> 24:30.792
What, lapero thing?

24:30.893 --> 24:34.395
I don't care about lapero things!

24:37.778 --> 24:39.519
It seems like the Ruffians accept it.

24:39.539 --> 24:41.601
Moco-chan.

24:41.621 --> 24:44.463
Oh, you're a different size.

24:44.523 --> 24:44.723
Wait.

24:47.748 --> 24:51.171
You'll accept Moco-chan even if she drinks the Rat King tea!

24:53.833 --> 24:54.354
Thank you!

24:54.374 --> 24:56.956
Thank you!

24:57.356 --> 25:00.058
BAU BAU!

25:00.079 --> 25:00.359
BAU BAU!

25:00.399 --> 25:01.940
That's happy, right Moco-chan?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.141
What?

25:03.321 --> 25:04.562
We're Ruffians!

25:04.782 --> 25:06.144
We do!

25:06.384 --> 25:07.605
We do!

25:08.346 --> 25:12.069
Ruffians... Well... You know...

25:14.358 --> 25:14.819
Dad!

25:14.859 --> 25:15.179
Guess what?

25:33.166 --> 25:34.807
He picks the lightbulb!

25:34.847 --> 25:36.168
We have light!

25:36.329 --> 25:39.311
We live in a world with den now!

25:39.491 --> 25:41.733
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

25:42.353 --> 25:43.735
Yeah, it's so nice.

25:44.135 --> 25:47.337
You know, especially when the days just keep on getting darker and colder.

25:48.538 --> 25:49.479
We have light now.

25:51.361 --> 25:53.983
Actually, it's why it's so cold so quickly.

25:54.003 --> 25:57.786
We thought that we left the air conditioning on by accident, but...

26:00.574 --> 26:03.255
This is the start of a new reality.

26:06.397 --> 26:13.962
Maybe... Maybe it's time to start eating more yummy food so we can get fluffy and fuzzy for the winter!

26:14.383 --> 26:14.963
Soup.

26:15.003 --> 26:16.304
We already eat soup.

26:17.005 --> 26:22.748
I don't know if getting fluffier and fuzzier is a proper solution, Moco-chan, you know?

26:23.089 --> 26:25.890
Instead of like more insulation for our bodies, you know?

26:26.211 --> 26:29.093
It's gonna take some time to kind of get rid of in the spring.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.136
We can just put on sweaters, you know?

26:32.156 --> 26:34.341
Sweaters or fluffy pajamas and ride.

26:34.422 --> 26:35.685
But what if I wanna eat?

26:36.903 --> 26:37.323
Stew.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.665
Stew?

26:40.405 --> 26:42.466
How is soup and stew different that much?

26:42.806 --> 26:46.268
Stew's expensive, soup is cheap.

26:48.169 --> 26:48.810
I guess.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.190
Stew is stew.

26:50.711 --> 26:51.051
What?

26:51.451 --> 26:53.072
That's what I was called.

26:53.152 --> 26:54.293
Stew is stew!

26:54.593 --> 26:55.073
No!

26:55.774 --> 26:58.015
Stew is a stew, right?

26:58.655 --> 26:59.496
And a soup.

27:00.416 --> 27:00.676
Soup.

27:01.497 --> 27:03.018
It's like it's a stoop and soup.

27:06.974 --> 27:07.314
Hi.

27:08.655 --> 27:10.316
Ruffians, you get it right.

27:10.336 --> 27:11.536
I don't think I get your brain.

27:13.077 --> 27:15.898
Soup and stew and soup and stoop.

27:17.879 --> 27:18.179
Right?

27:18.239 --> 27:19.500
They're similar but different.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.501
I think it's time for you to go back to bed.

27:23.002 --> 27:24.342
Well, happy news!

27:24.662 --> 27:25.603
Happy news!

27:25.623 --> 27:27.324
We have a light!

27:27.504 --> 27:28.524
Yeah!

27:29.845 --> 27:31.966
BAU BAU!

27:34.521 --> 27:36.222
Enough with the silliness.

27:36.402 --> 27:40.345
Maybe we'll check out some of our regular costumes here.

27:40.405 --> 27:49.211
The Doggie of the Day is... Dan Lily!

27:49.691 --> 27:52.293
She's super cute, look at all that.

27:52.493 --> 27:55.675
What kind of Halloween costume do you think this is though?

27:57.285 --> 27:57.947
A lion?

27:58.287 --> 27:59.129
A monster?

27:59.149 --> 28:00.972
An SSR?

28:01.212 --> 28:01.834
Makusou?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.436
Version of... Really?

28:04.642 --> 28:05.323
Definitely that.

28:05.363 --> 28:08.325
It's cute though!

28:08.605 --> 28:10.566
It makes me want to fluff her up.

28:10.626 --> 28:12.688
She has crazy hair!

28:12.908 --> 28:13.669
Right?

28:14.609 --> 28:15.130
Cute!

28:15.410 --> 28:18.412
I was thinking, how does she BAU BAU?

28:18.712 --> 28:21.294
You know, I think it would have to match the costume, right?

28:21.314 --> 28:23.736
Like an SSR BAU BAU.

28:24.657 --> 28:26.178
I think it would be still sort of rough.

28:26.558 --> 28:27.419
BAU BAU it!

28:28.437 --> 28:30.198
BAU BAU!

28:30.218 --> 28:31.398
Why does it have the power?

28:31.818 --> 28:32.998
SSR, Moco-chan.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.879
Oh, SSR power?

28:34.939 --> 28:35.439
Yeah.

28:36.079 --> 28:36.579
What's that?

28:36.959 --> 28:37.880
BAU BAU!

28:38.280 --> 28:38.640
Like that.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.080
I think that's fair.

28:40.320 --> 28:40.480
Right?

28:40.520 --> 28:44.321
Like, when Pokemon, when they evolve, they're, they're, they're cool?

28:44.582 --> 28:45.762
They kind of get all weird, right?

28:45.782 --> 28:46.842
Before it's like, wee-dee-weep!

28:46.942 --> 28:48.123
And then it's like, BAU BAU!

28:48.543 --> 28:48.903
Right?

28:49.263 --> 28:49.963
I guess, right?

28:50.283 --> 28:51.263
Uh-huh, makes sense.

28:51.363 --> 28:51.964
Uh-huh.

28:52.584 --> 28:56.545
Well, I think Lily really enjoys Halloween with you.

28:57.955 --> 29:03.976
There's lots of fun things going on, and new people to meet, and even more fun costumes.

29:04.337 --> 29:12.478
For one day a year, she gets to become a little bit of a different, a different kind of Lucia, a different side of herself.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.279
Lucia, she loves you very much.

29:15.599 --> 29:16.760
BAU BAU!

29:20.005 --> 29:23.349
Even though it's getting cold in, we're still going out, right?

29:23.589 --> 29:24.890
Let's see where you went!

29:24.970 --> 29:25.671
I'm excited.

29:25.691 --> 29:27.834
The walks have been very pretty.

29:27.974 --> 29:28.494
It's a pinky.

29:36.778 --> 29:37.919
The colors!

29:38.640 --> 29:39.661
The colors!

29:39.721 --> 29:40.582
It's a painting.

29:40.622 --> 29:45.928
You know, I feel like I have every color I need to paint a beautiful picture, right?

29:47.269 --> 29:48.631
It's a painting.

29:48.711 --> 29:52.535
I feel like I need to add nature sounds in the corner, right?

29:56.448 --> 29:57.729
Howl!

29:57.869 --> 29:58.029
Howl!

29:58.049 --> 29:58.169
Howl!

29:58.209 --> 29:58.389
Howl!

30:14.484 --> 30:15.445
A new alarm!

30:15.465 --> 30:18.908
A dentist!

30:19.928 --> 30:20.088
No!

30:20.108 --> 30:21.950
These are furry sounds, okay?

30:22.670 --> 30:24.212
What is furry?

30:24.452 --> 30:25.352
A robot!

30:25.573 --> 30:26.273
No!

30:26.293 --> 30:27.514
I don't know.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.616
Maybe we didn't quite get it, Moco-chan.

30:29.656 --> 30:30.296
Maybe not.

30:30.576 --> 30:33.799
Oh, but I can definitely tell why this would be your favorite song.

30:33.819 --> 30:34.599
Yeah!

30:35.560 --> 30:40.043
Maybe next time you go, you can let out a big BAU BAU for us.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.104
Maybe it will echo.

30:41.164 --> 30:41.244
Oh.

30:42.597 --> 30:43.217
BAU BAU!

30:43.277 --> 30:44.858
Like that.

30:44.938 --> 30:45.478
BAU!

30:46.679 --> 30:48.060
BAU BAU!

30:48.080 --> 30:50.080
So many colors.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.041
I'm not envious.

30:52.301 --> 30:53.762
Uh-uh.

30:53.822 --> 30:54.623
Right?

30:54.663 --> 30:54.863
Nope.

30:54.903 --> 30:57.984
We got a question from a Ruffian too.

30:58.004 --> 30:59.665
Our Question of the Day is...

31:09.324 --> 31:11.304
Hi FUWAMOCO!

31:11.665 --> 31:17.166
Is there any specific food that instantly teleports you back to your childhood when you eat it?

31:17.466 --> 31:21.687
For me, it's the pasta salad that my mom always used to make for dinner.

31:22.067 --> 31:22.507
Love you!

31:22.587 --> 31:23.467
Screams!

31:24.727 --> 31:29.008
BAU BAU!

31:29.909 --> 31:31.529
I don't know, it's not really a food.

31:32.409 --> 31:36.292
But, I wanted to eat it, but I don't think they make it anymore.

31:36.592 --> 31:39.555
For some reason, I really- Hi.

31:40.015 --> 31:43.058
I really remember, uh, these sort of cloth drops.

31:43.798 --> 31:46.881
They were black liquid, and they came in a roll.

31:46.901 --> 31:49.023
And they were called, I think, beach knots.

31:49.203 --> 31:49.443
Right?

31:49.503 --> 31:51.385
And the paper was like a wax paper?

31:51.405 --> 31:52.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:52.686 --> 31:54.067
It was fun to unwrap them.

31:54.127 --> 31:54.707
Beach knots.

31:54.767 --> 31:56.629
But it came in a roll, they were all connected.

31:56.689 --> 31:58.330
They were cloth drops.

32:00.912 --> 32:01.773
Does that make sense?

32:01.953 --> 32:05.574
I don't think so, but... I don't know if that's really a food, but I would like to have that.

32:05.594 --> 32:16.559
For me... It's not a food either, but I feel like... Moco-chan, I don't... I'm pretty sure you probably had the same one, too.

32:16.919 --> 32:20.341
Because if we get ice cream, you always pick the same thing as me, too, right?

32:20.381 --> 32:21.621
That's just how it goes, right?

32:21.981 --> 32:23.062
But there was one time...

32:24.378 --> 32:25.178
It was flat.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.319
But it was round.

32:41.654 --> 32:46.058
And it tasted like the most orange you could ever imagine.

32:46.078 --> 32:48.681
I can remember it so much.

32:48.721 --> 32:51.864
Just thinking of it makes my mouth kind of water a bit.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.826
But I only ever had it that once.

32:54.326 --> 32:55.667
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:55.687 --> 32:56.848
An orange popsicle.

32:57.169 --> 32:58.090
It was shiny!

32:58.490 --> 33:01.893
How does it remind you of your childhood if you had it once?

33:02.254 --> 33:04.336
Because it reminded me of eating it that once.

33:05.407 --> 33:07.107
Why the taste of the color orange?

33:07.187 --> 33:07.867
Exactly!

33:07.887 --> 33:10.428
It tasted so orange!

33:11.428 --> 33:12.428
So orange!

33:12.688 --> 33:14.389
I don't know, you could just eat an orange.

33:15.309 --> 33:16.249
No, it was better than that.

33:18.009 --> 33:20.810
It was like pure, pure orange.

33:21.450 --> 33:22.110
It was good.

33:23.990 --> 33:25.351
Fuwawa's core memory?

33:25.771 --> 33:26.291
It is!

33:26.311 --> 33:28.691
I only had it once and I remember it.

33:29.071 --> 33:33.092
Other than that, no like, cough drops and popsicles aren't food.

33:35.427 --> 33:40.729
I guess I remember the many, many carrot sticks we had to eat.

33:41.189 --> 33:41.629
Yeah.

33:41.989 --> 33:46.650
And sometimes, you know, eating carrot sticks multiple times a day.

33:46.670 --> 33:48.751
It's a lot of carrots.

33:49.231 --> 33:52.492
So they kind of get boiled and you think, what can I do to make this interesting?

33:53.212 --> 33:58.173
So then you take some yellow mustard and you eat it with the carrot and it actually tastes kind of good.

33:58.193 --> 34:00.634
Moco-chan, why are you shaking your head?

34:00.654 --> 34:01.654
You did it too!

34:01.734 --> 34:03.455
Yes, but I don't like the memory.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.617
Ruffians, did you ever do that?

34:07.658 --> 34:07.938
Same!

34:07.978 --> 34:09.479
Same!

34:09.659 --> 34:09.980
Yes.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.301
We have to eat it.

34:11.601 --> 34:13.142
Otherwise there's no escape.

34:13.483 --> 34:14.504
There's no escape.

34:14.824 --> 34:15.765
You have to eat it.

34:15.785 --> 34:18.227
Why not ranch?

34:18.267 --> 34:18.848
No ranch.

34:19.288 --> 34:20.950
No stuff like that.

34:21.010 --> 34:21.750
No ranch.

34:22.291 --> 34:23.031
Yellow mustard.

34:26.272 --> 34:29.533
I don't like this.

34:29.713 --> 34:30.874
I'll go without that.

34:30.914 --> 34:31.334
Thank you.

34:31.734 --> 34:35.716
I hope your pasta salad was yummy.

34:36.096 --> 34:36.977
Yummier than that.

34:37.057 --> 34:38.257
And carrots with mustard.

34:39.097 --> 34:41.919
I also remember being forced to eat some rice.

34:42.799 --> 34:43.899
Rice that I didn't like.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.440
I remember falling asleep at the table at night.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.681
I do too.

34:48.881 --> 34:50.481
We're very picky eaters.

34:51.262 --> 34:54.283
There's a lot of times when we're imprisoned at the table.

34:54.303 --> 34:56.523
We're used to being imprisoned.

34:56.563 --> 34:57.224
BAU BAU!

35:03.303 --> 35:06.145
We have no time for sleeping!

35:06.265 --> 35:08.446
It's FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:08.906 --> 35:11.888
And we have more streams coming in!

35:11.948 --> 35:16.490
Our next stream tonight is a bit spooky, so don't be surprised, okay?

35:16.511 --> 35:18.091
Get ready, okay, Ruffians?

35:18.292 --> 35:20.032
You can blur your eyes, okay?

35:20.052 --> 35:21.453
Blur them, okay.

35:21.473 --> 35:22.434
Just look into my eyes.

35:22.914 --> 35:24.615
Okay, it's not scary.

35:25.015 --> 35:28.117
Tonight, we're going to be playing DRAWL.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.481
I'm trying to make it funny because it's scary.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.582
We're worried, Ruffians.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.743
Please, please, please come help us.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.244
I don't know if Advent can do this.

35:47.864 --> 35:53.866
I talked about it yesterday during our member stream, but I have not bought that game.

35:54.266 --> 35:56.007
I have not downloaded the game.

35:56.767 --> 35:58.888
I need to do that, but it is frightening.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.160
So I need strength.

36:01.901 --> 36:05.882
Yeah, especially after Paranormal Cleanup last time.

36:06.042 --> 36:07.423
It's not that scary!

36:07.443 --> 36:09.804
Our confidence is very strong.

36:09.824 --> 36:12.445
I don't know, Ruffians.

36:12.965 --> 36:17.346
You've been watching our streams this month, right?

36:17.446 --> 36:20.007
I think our confidence is sort of a bit gone, huh?

36:20.628 --> 36:21.548
A bit depleted.

36:21.568 --> 36:23.369
Yeah.

36:23.669 --> 36:24.869
You're shaking already?

36:26.490 --> 36:26.690
Why?

36:28.271 --> 36:29.113
It's too scary.

36:29.133 --> 36:30.114
Wait, Ruffians.

36:30.515 --> 36:32.598
Controller isn't supported, right?

36:34.501 --> 36:35.663
It's not supported.

36:35.723 --> 36:37.906
It's a keyboard and mouse kind of thing, right?

36:39.468 --> 36:40.130
Please say so.

36:40.811 --> 36:41.532
Please say so.

36:42.713 --> 36:43.274
Please say so.

36:49.315 --> 36:49.956
We'll see.

36:50.697 --> 36:56.703
I-I hope it's a keyboard and mouse kind of thing because... then... I just need to help.

36:57.344 --> 36:59.687
I just need to help.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.088
You don't recommend controller.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.190
Okay!

37:02.470 --> 37:03.511
It has controller support.

37:03.551 --> 37:05.313
I've never touching anything.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.615
I've never touching anything.

37:08.497 --> 37:08.717
Well.

38:10.276 --> 38:12.818
BAU BAU!

38:12.838 --> 38:17.102
Really busy, but very exciting too!

38:19.169 --> 38:20.870
Do we have some tricks?

38:21.150 --> 38:22.931
We do have some tricks and treats!

38:22.991 --> 38:24.933
Some treats!

38:26.173 --> 38:29.575
Please look forward to the Ruffians!

38:29.655 --> 38:32.037
Thank you so much for joining us today for
