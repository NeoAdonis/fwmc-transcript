05:47.114 --> 05:52.441
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:52.801 --> 05:56.065
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:58.112 --> 06:02.217
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

06:02.237 --> 06:05.580
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

06:05.681 --> 06:08.183
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

06:08.303 --> 06:10.145
BAU BAU!

06:10.526 --> 06:15.271
I'm today with your host of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:15.691 --> 06:16.512
Ruffians!

06:16.693 --> 06:17.533
Good morning!

06:18.134 --> 06:24.597
Thank you for waking up and joining us for our 130th episode today!

06:24.737 --> 06:25.097
Our 130th!

06:25.157 --> 06:25.918
Yeah!

06:26.178 --> 06:26.778
Not our 1330th.

06:26.818 --> 06:29.540
That'd be cool, but no.

06:38.161 --> 06:41.463
I won 130 in the first round!

06:41.543 --> 06:43.144
BAU BAU!

06:43.224 --> 06:44.125
Did you sleep okay?

06:44.165 --> 06:46.427
I'm glad you couldn't sleep.

06:46.927 --> 06:48.268
Baby, you got a good sleep.

06:51.324 --> 06:54.605
If not last night, hopefully soon!

06:54.685 --> 06:56.646
Tonight for sure, okay?

06:56.746 --> 06:58.026
Good sleep is okay!

06:58.046 --> 06:58.746
11pm for you!

06:58.766 --> 07:01.467
Good sleep soon then!

07:01.927 --> 07:04.648
BAU BAU!

07:05.168 --> 07:10.369
Well for some Ruffians, the day might be ending soon, but also starting!

07:11.070 --> 07:12.410
So let's make a good start!

07:13.006 --> 07:14.447
Okay, got it!

07:14.987 --> 07:15.747
Bye-bye!

07:15.807 --> 07:26.110
For those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:26.290 --> 07:26.771
A.K.A.

FUWAMOCO!

07:28.191 --> 07:30.572

07:31.252 --> 07:36.954
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:37.334 --> 07:39.735
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

07:40.535 --> 07:43.957
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:43.977 --> 07:47.840

07:47.860 --> 07:50.162
BAU BAU!

07:50.182 --> 07:57.827
Hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag.

07:57.847 --> 07:57.987
BAU BAU!

07:58.187 --> 08:01.730
Sometimes I miss it when the Ruffians say BAU BAU, huh?

08:07.163 --> 08:09.325
BAU BAU!

08:09.966 --> 08:12.628
Let's have a really good day today, Ruffians.

08:12.648 --> 08:16.931
Whether you got a really good rest or maybe not quite enough.

08:17.232 --> 08:19.293
Ruffians!

08:20.494 --> 08:21.756
Disappointment awaits.

08:23.197 --> 08:26.199
Can we keep it waiting longer, Moco-chan?

08:26.520 --> 08:29.142
You know it's the start of a brand new month and everything.

08:29.222 --> 08:29.923
It's knocking!

08:31.130 --> 08:31.790
Are you looking?

08:32.691 --> 08:33.231
Let me in.

08:33.812 --> 08:34.432
Let me in.

08:34.532 --> 08:35.353
I don't want to.

08:35.373 --> 08:37.334
Because you know, I don't want to.

08:37.974 --> 08:39.395
It's a Pero Sighting.

08:40.536 --> 08:42.997
BAU BAU!

08:43.578 --> 08:48.901
Wait, is this gonna be like last time where I was like, oh it's a Pero Sighting, but then it wasn't?

08:49.401 --> 08:51.282
Well, let's check it out!

08:51.583 --> 08:53.083
Let's check it out, let's check it out!

08:53.163 --> 08:53.644
Okay!

08:53.664 --> 08:56.045
De-den!

08:56.065 --> 09:00.228
It's disappointment this time, huh?

09:01.452 --> 09:05.574
Wait, so you were hanging out with Pero?

09:07.656 --> 09:11.098
You like that, Ruffians?

09:11.938 --> 09:14.960
You just do that because you think it's fun?

09:15.260 --> 09:16.561
Voluntarily?

09:20.243 --> 09:25.886
Well, I guess watching and cheering for AZKi-senpai is nice though, huh?

09:26.026 --> 09:26.586
Yeah, but...

09:28.823 --> 09:36.794
Somehow, I'm not really too surprised that Pero would simply be interested in AZKi-senpai, you know.

09:37.215 --> 09:40.940
Especially after her amazing performance in Holo GTA.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.500
Yeah.

09:44.017 --> 09:47.959
You know, AZKi-senpai was just role-playing!

09:48.140 --> 09:48.280
Yes!

09:48.420 --> 09:49.200
Role-playing!

09:49.280 --> 09:51.522
Holo-GTA's role-playing service!

09:51.542 --> 09:54.844
No, since the Pero wouldn't understand that.

09:55.064 --> 10:03.329
Yeah, but, well, if that means that one more set of ears gets to enjoy AZKi-senpai's amazing voice!

10:03.349 --> 10:04.510
Yeah!

10:04.710 --> 10:05.911
That's a good thing, right?

10:05.971 --> 10:06.131
Yeah!

10:06.651 --> 10:19.904
And you know, Ruffians, if you haven't checked out her most recent major debut solo live, please go take a look at the sneak peek over at her channel, okay?

10:20.405 --> 10:22.327
You wouldn't want to hang out with Pero.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.048
That's good.

10:23.188 --> 10:23.828
That's good.

10:23.848 --> 10:25.310
Just, you know, hopefully.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.151
Hunting bag.

10:26.511 --> 10:27.131
Meow.

10:27.292 --> 10:27.712
Punch.

10:28.312 --> 10:29.533
Avoid the tongue.

10:30.074 --> 10:30.954
Those kind of things.

10:30.974 --> 10:31.094
Yeah.

10:31.134 --> 10:31.294

This time, we're off to Singapore at the end of November for Anime Festival Asia Alpha!

11:04.334 --> 11:06.975
BAU BAU!

11:06.995 --> 11:17.519
We're super excited to be there as guests alongside Kaede-senpai, Kronii-senpai as well as you know our other amazing senpai who are part of the hololive World Team.

11:18.019 --> 11:21.460
And you know we know that Alpha is an amazing event with

11:21.800 --> 11:28.025
So many famous anime song scenes that we admire performing there every single year!

11:28.045 --> 11:33.810
We're super excited to be able to be performing there alongside so many amazing people!

11:33.890 --> 11:34.631
Singapore!

11:34.691 --> 11:37.073
I'm so jealous of Singaporeans!

11:43.458 --> 11:50.461
But the world tour continues you know, so maybe we'll see you for this time maybe somewhere else in the future!

11:50.842 --> 11:51.502
Who knows?

11:52.923 --> 12:00.467
But we're just really really excited we'll be able to see some Ruffians maybe from all over Asia coming to see us!

12:00.767 --> 12:05.251
Gathered at the event, so we're really looking forward to it.

12:05.572 --> 12:14.380
Please, Ruffians, if you're gonna make it to AFA, make sure you bring your family to be ready to BAU BAU lots with us, okay?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.642
Are you gonna go?

12:18.283 --> 12:19.684
BAU BAU!

12:19.824 --> 12:23.446

12:24.467 --> 12:27.188
We'll be having a panel session!

12:29.370 --> 12:31.691
I'll see you there, BAU BAU!

12:31.731 --> 12:35.253
Just what kind of silly things are we gonna get up to there?

12:35.293 --> 12:36.053
No silliness.

12:36.474 --> 12:36.674
No!

12:36.694 --> 12:37.995

Bye-bye!

13:13.377 --> 13:14.877
What's HOLOCTOBER?

13:15.257 --> 13:18.659
Well, it's a drawing initiative started by Iofi-senpai!

13:18.699 --> 13:20.299
Yeah, Iofi-senpai!

13:20.319 --> 13:26.162
Yeah, there's a different theme to each day, so it's really nice because you'll never run out of ideas!

13:26.182 --> 13:29.083
Yeah, it's a drawing challenge, you know, to draw your oshi!

13:29.263 --> 13:33.385
Yeah, well, you know, you see, there's a first day, it's started with

13:34.505 --> 13:34.946
Medic.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.888
Why does that sound so familiar, huh Moco-chan?

13:38.908 --> 13:44.811
Definitely not FUWAMOCO.

13:45.231 --> 13:53.956
So you know, thanks to a lot of creative volunteers, we have received many amazing illustrations of Nurse FUWAMOCO!

13:54.996 --> 13:56.257
FUWAMOCO!

13:56.297 --> 13:57.117
Thank you!

13:57.137 --> 13:58.558
Thank you so much, Abyss!

13:58.598 --> 14:00.479
Yeah, you didn't know!

14:00.579 --> 14:04.461
Well, you know now you can join the Hot Tober!

14:04.481 --> 14:09.824
Challenge it so you know maybe how many illustrations you can draw every day!

14:09.844 --> 14:10.124
Right?

14:11.525 --> 14:13.726
But it doesn't have to be perfect, you know.

14:13.927 --> 14:15.107
Yeah, just blend.

14:15.387 --> 14:22.112
We're so excited to see what everyone's gonna get up to, create during this month, and just also see how much you grow too.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.012
Yeah, exactly!

14:23.152 --> 14:25.174
Having a bunch of fun as well.

14:26.014 --> 14:28.095
Yeah, you'll try for one.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.857
What you can do is just post it onto your social media.

14:31.097 --> 14:38.242
Yeah, you know, maybe if you draw FUWAMOCO, you can use the hashtag #FWMCPIXPIX.

14:38.822 --> 14:44.565
Yes, and you know, it doesn't just have to be drawing, it can be any sort of, you know, creative skill that you have, okay?

14:44.585 --> 14:49.348
So if it's music, and the theme is medics, then that's good, right?

14:49.708 --> 14:51.669
You didn't do day one, that's okay!

14:51.769 --> 14:53.130
That's okay, start day two!

14:53.170 --> 14:58.413
Yeah, you know, or maybe you're like, I don't know about police, I wanted to join nurse FUWAMOCO.

14:58.453 --> 14:59.313
Then that's okay too!

14:59.333 --> 15:01.755
Or you know, you've been doing it, and then day 12,

15:03.510 --> 15:05.471
FUWAMOCO Morning!

15:05.811 --> 15:08.893
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

15:21.940 --> 15:25.743
Wow, I think collective play is a very good thing to challenge yourself at, right?

15:26.564 --> 15:29.286
So please, Ruffians, have a lot of fun!

15:29.386 --> 15:29.886
Yeah!

15:30.047 --> 15:43.157
Actually, you know, it not only makes us happy, my senpai happy, but I'm sure Iohi-senpai really happy too, so... And more than anything, just being able to see you grow and have fun, that means the most to us, Ruffians.

15:43.657 --> 15:44.098
Got it!

15:44.258 --> 15:45.719
Please do your best, Ruffians!

15:45.739 --> 15:45.799
Yes!

15:45.839 --> 15:46.860
BAU BAU!

15:46.920 --> 15:47.841
BAU BAU!

15:50.960 --> 15:52.421
Gosh, Mococo!

15:52.742 --> 15:57.926
If that's what you want to draw... Moco-chan!

15:58.086 --> 15:59.928
You looking forward to it?

16:00.108 --> 16:00.668
Yeah!

16:00.969 --> 16:04.772
I'm looking forward to it!

16:05.292 --> 16:06.553
BAU BAU!

16:07.134 --> 16:07.434
Yes!

16:07.554 --> 16:08.855
Today, Ruffians!

16:09.315 --> 16:12.498
We finally revealed something special to you.

16:12.518 --> 16:13.519
Something special.

16:14.119 --> 16:18.423
Yeah, and that special thing was... IHO CD bodies!

16:18.443 --> 16:19.083
Yeah!

16:19.123 --> 16:19.684
BAU BAU!

16:21.033 --> 16:22.894
What did you think?

16:22.934 --> 16:28.137
Were you able to watch a movement?

16:28.397 --> 16:31.038
FUWAMOCO we had a bunch of fun together.

16:31.058 --> 16:35.101
Trying out a bunch of new things.

16:36.521 --> 16:42.805
But there was also some unfortunate reports of Ruffians having heart issues.

16:43.365 --> 16:44.926
Not surviving the stream.

16:44.966 --> 16:48.127
Those kind of things.

16:49.088 --> 16:49.368
You know.

16:51.146 --> 16:53.127
Maybe it'll be too much Ruffians.

16:53.628 --> 16:56.270
Maybe... Too cute.

16:57.070 --> 16:59.772
Too cute.

17:00.212 --> 17:01.133
You didn't survive.

17:01.213 --> 17:03.034
Your heart gave out!

17:03.094 --> 17:04.535
You're in the ICO!

17:04.595 --> 17:05.856
It was brutal!

17:08.639 --> 17:09.940
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.621
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:11.661 --> 17:12.661
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

17:31.052 --> 17:36.716
Maybe some extra silly... ONIGIRI HEAD FUWAMOCO!

17:37.056 --> 17:37.677
You know what?

17:38.037 --> 17:40.619
This is what happens when you get really hungry, Ruffians.

17:40.679 --> 17:43.281
Make sure you eat breakfast, okay?

17:43.361 --> 17:46.823
Okay, breakfast is important!

17:47.044 --> 17:49.065
And there is some singing too!

17:49.105 --> 17:50.886
Without the onigiri heads?

17:51.066 --> 17:53.768
No, no onigiri singing.

17:54.209 --> 17:59.092
But if you haven't taken a look yet, you'll definitely want to open!

18:01.340 --> 18:07.744
Make sure that you're prepared for lots of fluffy, fuzzy, silly, and cute.

18:08.024 --> 18:09.305
BAU BAU!

18:09.425 --> 18:11.727
Hey, take it easy, okay?

18:11.747 --> 18:12.587
Nani kore?

18:12.607 --> 18:13.228
Wakaranai no?

18:13.568 --> 18:14.208
FUWAMOCO dayo.

18:14.228 --> 18:14.949
FUWAMOCO.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.710
Fuwa konna sugata dayo.

18:16.730 --> 18:17.170
BAU BAU!

18:17.410 --> 18:17.570
Wow.

18:29.699 --> 18:31.041
It was really fun!

18:31.121 --> 18:32.082
Really exciting!

18:32.102 --> 18:33.604
Bye!

18:33.664 --> 18:36.629
Like we always say, there's so many exciting things coming up!

18:37.049 --> 18:37.850
And it's the truth!

18:38.431 --> 18:40.334
Calli-senpai!

18:40.574 --> 18:44.200
Calli-senpai actually had some surprises!

18:45.401 --> 18:50.143
Oh, some sudden surprises that she shared yesterday!

18:50.524 --> 18:54.626
Maybe some Ruffians were asleep and didn't catch it, but wow!

18:55.046 --> 19:02.471
Cali-senpai, she first unveiled an update, and now she's better prepared for the summer time!

19:03.311 --> 19:03.712
Look!

19:04.032 --> 19:08.735
She can take off her cape!

19:08.775 --> 19:09.135
Bye bye!

19:09.455 --> 19:10.417
Watame-senpai's favorite!

19:25.120 --> 19:31.385
Ah, but you know, while some deafbeats enjoyed that, she actually had even more to share!

19:31.445 --> 19:33.366
Not just that!

19:33.446 --> 19:35.207
Not just Wacky Plays!

19:35.327 --> 19:35.608
Yeah!

19:35.688 --> 19:51.019
Well, Cali-senpai should know that later this month, she'll be releasing a brand new original song featuring all of hololive English, and including affiliates like Ami-senpai too!

19:51.119 --> 19:51.959
Yeah!

19:51.999 --> 19:52.420
Wow!

19:53.340 --> 19:55.403
We're so excited!

19:55.624 --> 20:00.691
This song, it's something that Calli-senpai's been working on for a long time.

20:01.232 --> 20:02.374
Such a long time!

20:03.315 --> 20:05.418
Even before Justice's debut.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.480
That's a long time.

20:08.783 --> 20:09.583
It's a long time.

20:09.643 --> 20:14.064
Yeah, and you know she's worked really hard at writing the lyrics for it too.

20:14.485 --> 20:17.045
So we really hope that you'll look forward to this one!

20:17.065 --> 20:17.705
Yeah!

20:18.206 --> 20:19.886
Yeah, the whole team!

20:19.966 --> 20:20.686
Yeah!

20:20.746 --> 20:20.966
Yeah!

20:21.166 --> 20:24.247
Yeah, justice is a part too!

20:24.307 --> 20:26.068
Yeah, justice everybody!

20:26.168 --> 20:26.828
Yeah!

20:27.108 --> 20:27.708
Yeah.

20:28.168 --> 20:30.609
But we're just, we're so excited for it.

20:30.649 --> 20:33.910
The lyrics are really really beautiful and touching.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.371
And it was just an amazing experience for us to record.

20:39.288 --> 20:46.675
We're really, really excited to be here together with all of you for the first time!

20:46.695 --> 20:47.555
You know, right?

20:47.655 --> 20:48.236
Right!

20:48.636 --> 20:50.818
Look at all of us here!

20:51.359 --> 20:53.561
Wow, it's gonna be something else.

20:54.301 --> 20:55.442
But!

20:55.763 --> 20:59.406
Well, it was not just that, Ruffians!

20:59.646 --> 21:02.328
Nine-senpai didn't stop there, you know!

21:03.877 --> 21:10.801
Recently, as in, in September, you know, there was ENreco and then hololive GTA.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.322
Yeah.

21:12.682 --> 21:16.744
And you know, we've been having so much fun with those really big collabs.

21:17.324 --> 21:23.087
That, well, hololive English, we're gonna have another big collab!

21:23.367 --> 21:25.749
We're gonna be playing 7 Days to Die!

21:25.809 --> 21:26.169
Yeah!

21:26.249 --> 21:28.170
BAU BAU!

21:30.911 --> 21:35.352
It'll be spanning 7 days.

21:35.372 --> 21:36.553
7 days to die.

21:36.813 --> 21:39.073
From October 10th to 17th.

21:39.474 --> 21:49.017
And participating in the event right now is Fauna-senpai, us FUWAMOCO, Laura, Ina-senpai,

21:50.157 --> 22:00.220
Pony-senpai, Gigi, Shiori, Kiara-senpai, Bae-senpai, Cecilia, Calli-senpai, and Biboo!

22:00.240 --> 22:05.002
So we hope that you look forward to it!

22:05.042 --> 22:07.162
Will it be a live stream of Running 24x7?

22:07.503 --> 22:10.504
I think the plan is to do two different times.

22:10.564 --> 22:11.364
I don't know though.

22:12.044 --> 22:16.566
Things are still to be determined so please look forward to it!

22:16.586 --> 22:19.748
It's gonna be lots of fun!

22:19.988 --> 22:20.848
FUWAMOCO!

22:21.148 --> 22:23.409
We've never played 7 Days to Die before.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.890
I don't know what it's about at all.

22:26.011 --> 22:26.891
What type of game is it?

22:26.911 --> 22:27.871
I don't know.

22:27.892 --> 22:31.713
I think we have 7 days to die but generally you don't want to die.

22:31.733 --> 22:33.594
So if we want to survive.

22:34.074 --> 22:34.975
I think so.

22:34.995 --> 22:37.076
I think there might be zombies.

22:40.002 --> 22:41.463
I thought it was like a mountain.

22:42.604 --> 22:43.025
Mountain.

22:43.765 --> 22:44.906
Survival, maybe.

22:46.287 --> 22:47.348
It's spooky once more.

22:47.628 --> 22:49.630
Moco-chan, there has to be zombies.

22:51.731 --> 22:52.092
Yeah.

22:52.332 --> 22:55.274
Yeah, the objective of the game is to die.

22:55.354 --> 22:57.096
I think it's to survive.

22:57.116 --> 23:00.919
If you die, then you can't play the game.

23:03.503 --> 23:04.663
Survive!

23:04.743 --> 23:08.024
We're gonna survive!

23:08.604 --> 23:12.325
It's extreme violence Minecraft.

23:13.066 --> 23:15.366
Well, we'll see!

23:15.886 --> 23:18.127
One thing's for sure is maybe we might die.

23:18.587 --> 23:19.727
Maybe we might survive.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.548
That's for sure, we might maybe die.

23:22.727 --> 23:30.659
I think that's for sure is that we're gonna have a lot of fun.

23:31.260 --> 23:32.622
BAU BAU!

23:32.822 --> 23:35.025
We're solving this, we're solving this.

23:37.769 --> 23:38.710
BAU BAU!

23:39.570 --> 23:42.353
Are you looking forward to it, Ruffians?

23:42.373 --> 23:43.213
I am too.

23:43.433 --> 23:44.214
I am too.

23:44.254 --> 23:44.935
BAU BAU!

23:45.095 --> 23:46.236
Wow, Ruffians.

23:46.256 --> 23:47.777
We have some more news for you.

24:03.218 --> 24:09.141
As well you might have seen on Twitter, it's been a little bit of a rough time for us.

24:10.281 --> 24:27.109
Just the other night, our favorite place in the world, Akihabara Mister Donut announced that after seven, uh, seventeen, after fifty-two, fifty-two years of business, that they'll be closing the doors at the end of this month.

24:28.089 --> 24:28.329
Yeah.

24:28.689 --> 24:29.630
It's really sudden.

24:30.350 --> 24:30.530
Yeah.

24:30.550 --> 24:32.491
You know, and to be honest,

24:41.466 --> 24:45.550
Maybe Ruffians might think of FUWAMOCO as just being silly, you know.

24:46.091 --> 24:50.795
After all, it's just a location of a chain store that sells donuts.

24:51.296 --> 24:54.218
But, it's not just that, you know.

24:54.839 --> 24:56.801
So, not just that to us too, you know.

24:56.881 --> 24:58.142
Akiba Mister Donut.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.505
It stands for so much, you know.

25:01.665 --> 25:03.667
And just so many, you know.

25:05.253 --> 25:13.180
I think one thing that's really big is that over the past few years, the scenery of Akiba has constantly been changing.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.061
Constantly!

25:14.081 --> 25:21.167
You know, especially with old businesses leaving, new ones coming in, you know, big buildings disappearing.

25:21.187 --> 25:25.011
It's just the overall atmosphere has really been changing.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.814
You know, things do over time, but very rapidly.

25:29.739 --> 25:37.366
But the one thing that never changed, never ever changed, was this Akiba Mister Donut.

25:37.787 --> 25:41.450
It survived through so many important times.

25:41.991 --> 25:42.511
Events.

25:43.172 --> 25:43.733
A fire.

25:43.853 --> 25:45.314
A fire too.

25:45.414 --> 25:47.696
And it's been in so many different media projects.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.338
The anime 16-bit sensation!

25:50.438 --> 25:53.258
Yeah, it was a very very... I see!

25:53.919 --> 25:57.780
It was... It was a 16-bit sensation, too, you know?

25:57.860 --> 26:04.322
It was special, too, because she'd be able to go into the future and then back.

26:04.782 --> 26:07.343
Because this Akiba Mister Donut was there!

26:07.463 --> 26:07.903
Yeah.

26:07.983 --> 26:14.525
So, no matter how much Akiba changes... No matter how much time goes by, it was always there, so... But...

26:15.338 --> 26:17.699
Maybe that's not the case anymore, you know.

26:17.719 --> 26:20.400
But the FUWAMOCO, you know.

26:20.820 --> 26:27.183
More importantly, it was just a very special place to us during many times in our lives.

26:28.199 --> 26:33.165
And you know, we said it to you very early after we debuted.

26:33.386 --> 26:39.694
And I think many Ruffians were worried because you know, that FUWAMOCO, we won't really be able to go there again.

26:39.714 --> 26:42.317
You know, our ears, our tails, they stand out.

26:42.337 --> 26:44.459
And you know, that still stands true.

26:45.881 --> 26:49.323
More importantly, more than us being able to go there ourselves.

26:49.343 --> 26:49.423
Yeah.

26:50.043 --> 26:55.346
We just wanted to be able to share such a special place to us that's brought us so much happiness.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.367
And you know, have more Ruffians, have more people experience that.

26:59.407 --> 26:59.668
Yeah.

27:00.228 --> 27:10.513
So for us, you know, now that it'll be closing up, it's really sad because we wanted more Ruffians to be able to go and enjoy it, you know?

27:10.533 --> 27:13.154
We still wanted to be able to do much, much more.

27:13.194 --> 27:13.534
But...

27:15.630 --> 27:20.512
You know, we're really happy for the Ruffians that have been able to go and enjoy it.

27:21.132 --> 27:28.676
But we hope that you'll be able to celebrate it during the remaining month and it'll be around for business.

27:29.562 --> 27:30.742
Moco-chan.

27:52.342 --> 27:57.163
Wow, but we hope, Ruffians, that you'll be able to go if you're in Japan.

27:57.263 --> 28:03.245
And maybe, maybe, if someone, you have a trip planned coming up before the end of the month.

28:03.665 --> 28:14.267
But even if this Akiba Mister Donut, maybe it's no more, we hope that you'll visit other locations too and keep wandering and enjoy them there too.

28:14.367 --> 28:16.048
It's not like they're going away, is it?

28:16.948 --> 28:24.674
It's just that we're in a very special location, so... It's FUWAMOCO seem a little bit sad.

28:25.194 --> 28:26.235
It's because of that.

28:26.836 --> 28:31.319
BAU BAU!

28:31.819 --> 28:34.902
We're gonna miss it.

28:34.962 --> 28:36.263
We're gonna miss it, yeah.

28:36.763 --> 28:39.565
Not just FUWAMOCO, but a lot of Ruffians.

28:39.986 --> 28:43.388
A lot of people too, you know, so... I think BAU will miss it.

28:43.809 --> 28:44.229
Yeah.

28:46.182 --> 28:50.285
BAU BAU!

28:50.745 --> 28:56.608
You know... It's been a little bit of a rough time for all of us, you know?

28:57.209 --> 29:03.732
A little bit of a double shock for FUWAMOCO, but... Moco-chan, it'll be okay, right?

29:04.913 --> 29:05.473
Right!

29:07.655 --> 29:10.656
Moco-chan, you know just what to say in times like this, right?

29:11.056 --> 29:12.938
I don't know if I know what to say!

29:15.140 --> 29:29.488
Ruffians!

29:31.009 --> 29:33.130
You know what time it is, right?

29:34.711 --> 29:41.615
It's time that you're gonna listen up because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

29:42.775 --> 29:42.935
Ahem.

29:43.755 --> 29:45.856
I'm gonna do my best, okay?

29:45.876 --> 29:47.957
So you're gonna hear it!

29:48.578 --> 29:50.418
Straight from me, Mococo!

29:51.099 --> 29:53.040
What is... hot?

29:55.381 --> 29:57.862
It's been a bit rough recently, huh, Ruffians?

29:59.743 --> 30:01.684
You know, a lot's been going on.

30:01.704 --> 30:10.928
And honestly, I'm sure it's been exhausting for you, not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, too.

30:12.179 --> 30:12.900
Trust me!

30:12.920 --> 30:14.641
We get it!

30:15.682 --> 30:19.985
Just like you- We have hard times like that all the time too.

30:20.765 --> 30:25.949
Times when we feel like it's so rough, but it's hard to get the courage to continue on.

30:25.969 --> 30:31.033
And in those times, you just have to accept that, okay?

30:31.934 --> 30:32.955
That's how you feel!

30:32.975 --> 30:35.917
You can't change how you feel, even if you think

30:37.127 --> 30:39.589
Maybe I'm just being silly.

30:39.689 --> 30:44.192
After all, it's just this or that or whatever.

30:45.193 --> 30:48.955
But give yourself a bit of time to process things, okay?

30:49.736 --> 30:56.360
I'm sure it'll still be rough, but maybe you'll feel just a bit lighter and like you can continue on, okay?

30:56.380 --> 31:02.364
Figure out what you can do with those feelings and how you can put them to good use for you!

31:02.384 --> 31:04.226
I know you can do it!

31:05.282 --> 31:08.343
No matter what, you'll get through this rough patch, okay?

31:09.424 --> 31:13.266
And of course, we're here for you!

31:13.466 --> 31:14.106
2NE1, okay?

31:15.006 --> 31:15.947
Don't forget that!

31:16.967 --> 31:17.928
Ganbatte ne!

31:18.628 --> 31:19.408
BAU BAU!

31:22.618 --> 31:24.800
BAU BAU!

31:24.820 --> 31:28.945
A lot of feelings, huh?

31:29.025 --> 31:30.507
Right, Moco-chan?

31:31.748 --> 31:34.331
Let's do our best, okay, Ruffians?

31:34.531 --> 31:35.031
Okay!

31:35.172 --> 31:41.959
I knew October is gonna be a fun one too, so... Overcome everything, exactly.

31:41.979 --> 31:43.581
We can do it, okay?

31:44.181 --> 31:44.842
BAU BAU!

31:45.504 --> 31:47.485
FUWAMOCO!

31:47.945 --> 31:50.287
Let's take a look at the Doggie of the Day today!

31:50.327 --> 31:52.788
Doggie of the Day!

31:52.868 --> 31:57.150
This Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

31:57.191 --> 31:59.212
Gigi!

31:59.272 --> 32:01.473
Gigi, I'm too silly!

32:01.953 --> 32:04.655
Yeah, she's not Pidgey!

32:04.715 --> 32:05.735
She's Gigi!

32:09.686 --> 32:10.667
I'm not Gigi.

32:10.687 --> 32:12.669
I'm Mococo!

32:13.150 --> 32:14.331
BAU BAU!

32:14.351 --> 32:16.053
I don't know Gigi.

32:17.334 --> 32:17.915
Gigi.

32:18.455 --> 32:20.677
Gigi Morning?

32:21.258 --> 32:21.679
No.

32:22.559 --> 32:25.022
Gigi!

32:25.322 --> 32:30.488
You know she's very cute and silly which is kind of similar to Gigi, right?

32:32.927 --> 32:33.227
Yeah.

32:33.928 --> 32:38.891
I guess she has a bit of a, sort of a, a gremlin aura to her too, huh?

32:39.912 --> 32:43.234
Are we sure this isn't actually Gigi Muin?

32:43.254 --> 32:49.438
I don't know.

32:49.918 --> 32:50.959
BAU BAU!

32:52.040 --> 32:54.261
BAU BAU!

32:54.502 --> 32:56.423
It kinda looks like her actually, huh?

32:56.903 --> 32:59.345
It's not Fiji, it's Gigi.

32:59.365 --> 33:00.005
Yeah.

33:01.546 --> 33:02.267
Gigi Muin.

33:03.536 --> 33:05.599
Moco-chan.

33:06.340 --> 33:06.840
FUWAMOCO!

33:21.301 --> 33:24.043
BAU BAU sound like she's asking for help.

33:25.844 --> 33:28.145
I feel like there's a little bit of distress in them.

33:28.165 --> 33:29.386
Distress?

33:30.107 --> 33:35.450
Is she in trouble?

33:35.770 --> 33:38.592
Is she stuck in a sofa?

33:40.933 --> 33:43.275
Stop that, Moco-chan.

33:44.215 --> 33:45.256
I'm feeling numb.

33:49.756 --> 33:53.365
Ah, you know, Gigi's been by your side for a long time.

33:53.505 --> 33:54.668
Eight to nine years!

33:57.407 --> 34:00.569
And you know, I can see those big eyes there!

34:00.629 --> 34:03.270
That she loves you very, very much.

34:03.930 --> 34:09.573
Actually, you know, she might get extra silly at times, but who doesn't?

34:09.613 --> 34:13.374
Right, that's just another way that she shows how she feels, you know?

34:13.495 --> 34:14.475
Exactly!

34:14.495 --> 34:15.716
BAU BAU!

34:15.776 --> 34:18.997
Keep it close, okay?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.078
Don't let her get lost in the sofa.

34:21.578 --> 34:23.019
Yeah, sofas are dangerous.

34:24.057 --> 34:25.618
Open!

34:26.298 --> 34:30.320
And next we have our... Today I went on a walk.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.321
De-den!

34:36.302 --> 34:37.863
That's amazing.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.124
Beach cleanup!

34:39.164 --> 34:43.285
Thank you for helping out the environment by cleaning up the beach.

34:43.345 --> 34:45.907
I saw some birds in that bath.

34:46.247 --> 34:47.487
You're not a bird though, right?

34:48.488 --> 34:48.728
No.

34:49.028 --> 34:49.128
No.

34:50.124 --> 34:54.687
Birds can't take away that much trash from the beach.

34:54.727 --> 34:58.991
And that sure is a lot of garbage you have there.

34:59.051 --> 35:03.254
We're proud of you!

35:03.274 --> 35:07.897
I hope that the sunburn that you picked up along the way, that it was listened to.

35:12.102 --> 35:14.304
Make sure you put some aloe on it, okay?

35:14.684 --> 35:15.244
Okay.

35:15.304 --> 35:15.805
Got it.

35:15.825 --> 35:17.446
It's silly.

35:17.466 --> 35:19.247
It's green and sorta goopy.

35:19.687 --> 35:21.148
But it works, okay?

35:21.248 --> 35:21.809
Yeah.

35:21.929 --> 35:22.669
Okay.

35:22.749 --> 35:23.029
Yeah!

35:23.049 --> 35:24.010
We're so proud of you!

35:24.110 --> 35:26.252
Thank you for helping us!

35:26.312 --> 35:28.833
Next time, wear sunscreen.

35:29.134 --> 35:29.554
Got it?

35:29.574 --> 35:31.015
That's an order.

35:31.035 --> 35:32.816
I'm sure that sunscreen was applied.

35:32.896 --> 35:33.196
No.

35:33.476 --> 35:34.957
More sunscreen.

35:35.318 --> 35:36.899
You have to reapply.

35:38.375 --> 35:39.438
Okay, Moco-chan.

35:39.458 --> 35:40.581
BAU BAU!

35:40.661 --> 35:43.268
Chiyuri, what a day!

35:47.708 --> 35:49.109
BAU BAU!

35:49.650 --> 35:53.773
And for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

35:53.933 --> 35:56.175
Hi FUWAMOCO!

35:56.635 --> 35:57.516
Hello!

35:57.656 --> 36:00.258
I know you love Advent members.

36:00.278 --> 36:00.418
Yes.

36:00.919 --> 36:04.281
Could you tell us what you love about each member?

36:04.301 --> 36:04.902
Everything.

36:05.883 --> 36:09.586
This is both an easy and really hard question.

36:09.606 --> 36:11.727
Everything.

36:11.888 --> 36:14.550
First, I love how everyone is so unique.

36:15.993 --> 36:19.718
We're all similar, but very, very different.

36:19.959 --> 36:21.380
You know it.

36:21.661 --> 36:22.923
Shiori!

36:23.243 --> 36:25.526
Shiori, she's really silly.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.881
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

36:50.719 --> 36:54.605
I'm always surprised at what kind of things she's up to and what she's doing.

36:54.625 --> 36:58.471
She's always so passionate and working on her mysterious projects.

36:59.172 --> 37:00.214
You did that Shiori!

37:00.274 --> 37:01.756
Why didn't you tell us?

37:06.318 --> 37:06.978
And Biboo!

37:07.058 --> 37:11.381
Biboo is an amazing gamer!

37:12.221 --> 37:15.583
And she's very silly.

37:16.003 --> 37:21.406
And you know, I think you and FUWAMOCO are kind of very silly in a different way too.

37:21.686 --> 37:29.349
But she gets exactly what we're thinking of and planning and we just love bouncing off of her to create extra funny moments.

37:30.670 --> 37:31.431
Silly Rock.

37:31.531 --> 37:31.891
Yes.

37:32.392 --> 37:34.754
She's an amazing friend!

37:34.834 --> 37:35.935
Amazing friend!

37:35.955 --> 37:37.776
She works so hard too, you know.

37:37.816 --> 37:39.698
She surprises us so much too.

37:40.018 --> 37:40.939
You know.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.841
She's always challenging herself!

37:44.242 --> 37:49.807
You know, she kinda comes off as really silly, but she's very very ambitious.

37:50.007 --> 37:50.527
Passionate.

37:50.587 --> 37:51.648
Passionate too.

37:51.808 --> 37:54.871
And she's not someone to fade away from a challenge.

37:55.611 --> 37:55.952
No.

37:56.412 --> 37:57.113
Not at all.

37:59.472 --> 38:00.875
Nerissa!

38:00.895 --> 38:01.997
So kind!

38:02.037 --> 38:02.979
She's too kind.

38:03.059 --> 38:03.940
She's too kind.

38:08.694 --> 38:13.235
Obviously I have to say she's an amazing singer because that's... Of course!

38:13.255 --> 38:18.717
But there's so much more to her than just, you know, amazing singing.

38:18.737 --> 38:23.398
Her skills, her personality is what truly shines from her.

38:23.778 --> 38:29.639
She works so hard and puts a lot of thought into her music, all the lyrics, she wrote everything.

38:29.659 --> 38:32.940
I really admire her skill and dedication.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.261
And you know she's always there to be able to help out FUWAMOCO.

38:36.621 --> 38:38.763
FUWAMOCO, we have a silly question.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.465
She's always sending us silly things, too.

38:41.825 --> 38:44.247
Yeah, she's like another sister to us.

38:44.367 --> 38:49.411
I mean, all of Advent is, but maybe Nerissa the most.

38:51.613 --> 38:54.575
You know, FUWAMOCO's FUWAMOCO.

38:54.655 --> 38:55.676
Shiori's Shiori.

38:55.716 --> 38:58.098
Biboo and Nerissa's Nerissa.

38:58.498 --> 39:01.981
But sometimes I'm like, I wish I could be a little bit like Nerissa.

39:02.521 --> 39:04.042
A little bit like Biboo.

39:04.062 --> 39:06.324
A little bit like Shiori.

39:06.785 --> 39:10.388
But I can't.

39:11.028 --> 39:13.990
That's just how much we really love all of them.

39:14.731 --> 39:15.512
So many ways.

39:15.612 --> 39:16.032
I don't know.

39:16.052 --> 39:17.213
I don't know if we answered it well.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.055
It's kind of hard when you put on the spot.

39:19.115 --> 39:19.755
Is it okay?

39:19.835 --> 39:21.757
Ruffians.

39:22.938 --> 39:26.060
Advent is really amazing.

39:26.160 --> 39:31.705
So why would you... I would pay attention like Advent.

39:33.901 --> 39:42.929
We just feel so so incredibly lucky to be together with them as a gem.

39:42.949 --> 39:46.552
More than anything else to really close friends.

39:46.612 --> 39:47.433
We love Advent.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.394
We really do.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.588
BAU BAU!

39:57.608 --> 39:58.608
BAU BAU!

39:58.708 --> 39:59.888
Is that choppy enough?

40:00.928 --> 40:05.109
I don't know, I still don't feel like I was able to express how I feel very well.

40:05.129 --> 40:07.690
I love everyone.

40:08.610 --> 40:08.770
Yeah.

40:08.790 --> 40:10.351
Why did Shiori collab?

40:10.971 --> 40:11.911
SUDE!

40:13.291 --> 40:17.032
SUDE, I feel like... There's so many things we want to do.

40:17.052 --> 40:18.152
This is hard to happen.

40:18.172 --> 40:20.273
We haven't really... Oh, that's not true.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.733
We had a zachino with Nerissa.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.474
I don't often collab with Nerissa.

40:23.954 --> 40:24.274
Yeah.

40:26.655 --> 40:27.897
It's just Shiori and I, huh?

40:28.478 --> 40:33.106
Yeah, it's just- FUWAMOCO Get the- Game we wanna play, huh?

40:33.126 --> 40:33.787
This is a game.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.570
I bought it already.

40:38.562 --> 40:40.543
BAU BAU!

40:40.603 --> 40:42.804
Thank you for the questions!

40:43.184 --> 40:46.225
Ruffians, we're always waiting for your questions!

40:46.666 --> 40:50.067
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

40:50.387 --> 40:54.529
If you see a cute doggy, send it to us because we love cute doggies!

40:54.809 --> 40:57.330
We also love seeing what walks you've gone on.

40:58.791 --> 41:02.632
We don't love it, but if you happen to see Pero, please send us your Pero's letters too.

41:02.652 --> 41:05.834
It's important to know the reports of where he's been.

41:06.314 --> 41:07.335
BAU BAU!

41:07.455 --> 41:14.439
You are our next gym.

41:14.779 --> 41:19.962
It's a little ways away, but that's because it's a big busy day for FUWAMOCO.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.964
Very busy, we couldn't do our best, Ruffians.

41:23.424 --> 41:25.346
Please give us lots of head pats.

41:25.786 --> 41:25.966
But!

41:26.006 --> 41:32.451
Well, our next stream will be tomorrow evening and we're playing The Forest together with all of Abyss!

41:32.571 --> 41:36.754
I think I am confused between what The Forest is and what Seven Days of Dawn is.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.276
Well, we'll find out very shortly.

41:39.316 --> 41:40.017
FUWAMOCO-chan!

41:40.037 --> 41:41.058
I mean similar!

41:45.553 --> 41:46.093
Survive.

41:46.894 --> 41:47.414
Survive.

41:47.534 --> 41:47.894
Okay.

41:48.414 --> 41:48.914
Yeah.

41:48.995 --> 41:51.356
Oh, it's a funky fours?

41:51.936 --> 41:52.396
Got it.

41:52.756 --> 41:54.477
Funky fours survival.

41:54.497 --> 41:55.817
We like funky fours.

41:56.038 --> 41:57.398
We like the fortune fours.

41:57.738 --> 41:58.018
Yeah.

41:58.118 --> 41:58.559
Joy fours.

41:58.579 --> 41:58.999
Joy fours.

41:59.119 --> 42:00.019
Yeah!

42:00.039 --> 42:00.580
Yeah.

42:00.620 --> 42:04.161
Oh, but we're gonna have a fortune four all together with Advent.

42:04.581 --> 42:07.623
I wonder what fours, like, would be like all together with them.

42:08.483 --> 42:08.563
Bye!

42:08.623 --> 42:08.683
Fun.

42:08.723 --> 42:10.624
I bet you Nerissa will sing us a bunch of songs too.

42:10.644 --> 42:10.764
Yeah.

42:10.784 --> 42:11.465
Count fire songs together.

42:11.485 --> 42:12.245
Count fire songs.

42:12.265 --> 42:12.485
