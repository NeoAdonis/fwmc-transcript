Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:15.995 --> 05:19.482
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:19.502 --> 05:23.831
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:23.871 --> 05:24.593
BAU BAU!

05:25.623 --> 05:27.304
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:27.364 --> 05:28.944
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.964 --> 05:29.845
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.865 --> 05:46.071
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

05:46.992 --> 05:48.354
Thank you, Ruffians!

05:48.774 --> 05:50.297
We made it to the end of the week!

05:51.058 --> 05:53.481
And today, it's the 79th episode!

05:53.622 --> 05:55.965
Thank you for joining us!

05:56.005 --> 05:56.966
Thank you!

05:57.047 --> 05:59.130
BAU BAU!

05:59.170 --> 05:59.590
We did it!

06:03.155 --> 06:05.275
It's just about the weekend.

06:05.856 --> 06:06.616
Wow.

06:07.116 --> 06:07.996
Ruffians!

06:08.416 --> 06:16.058
I saw that today is Joshua's first time joining us live for FUWAMOCO Morning, so we couldn't explain.

06:16.078 --> 06:23.619
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:23.799 --> 06:25.360
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:25.920 --> 06:29.000
That is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:29.540 --> 06:31.981
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face

06:32.401 --> 06:35.525
I hope you start your day off on the right paw!

06:35.706 --> 06:39.911
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:42.291 --> 06:44.193
Have you ever seen morning?

06:44.213 --> 06:47.176
Moco-chan, do your job okay?

06:47.276 --> 06:51.761
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:52.302 --> 06:54.063
BAU BAU!

06:54.444 --> 06:59.629
You think in the 79th time you'd be good at something, huh?

07:03.633 --> 07:05.834
It doesn't quite always go that way, huh?

07:05.914 --> 07:09.015
Yeah, hi to the new FUWAMOCO Morning viewers!

07:09.155 --> 07:16.038
And hi to our regular FUWAMOCO Morning viewers, too!

07:16.058 --> 07:16.098
Hi!

07:16.118 --> 07:17.358
BAU BAU!

07:18.879 --> 07:22.280
I have a feeling it's gonna be a very good day today, huh?

07:22.320 --> 07:22.520
Yeah.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.541
Yeah.

07:25.321 --> 07:31.483
But... Ruffians... Does this make your day any better?

07:31.704 --> 07:32.704
Because I...

07:34.505 --> 07:37.126
There was another hero sighting.

07:39.206 --> 07:40.666
Does this make your day better?

07:40.687 --> 07:40.747
Why?

07:41.867 --> 07:42.587
Or worse?

07:44.567 --> 07:46.308
Where was he spotted, Moco-chan?

07:47.848 --> 07:48.148
Wow.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.829
If the Ruffians say it's better, okay.

07:52.169 --> 07:53.370
Prepare yourself.

07:54.730 --> 07:55.050
De-den.

08:00.185 --> 08:03.606
Did Pero make his visual novel debut?

08:03.686 --> 08:07.207
For us?

08:09.347 --> 08:22.950
It's not like I'm envious, but... Well... It looks like, you know, this VN dates back quite a while.

08:22.990 --> 08:25.371
Looking at the UI and everything.

08:26.385 --> 08:26.705
Violence.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.313
That sounds good.

08:48.533 --> 08:48.953
Yeah?

08:49.113 --> 08:52.894
But, but, but, but... Actually, Ruffians!

08:53.314 --> 08:58.515
The thing that I like the best is that... Do you see on the side there, right beside me?

08:58.855 --> 09:06.096
See, you have all your tools and options to use on Pero... I guess the... You don't mean... I guess that'd be Pero.

09:06.997 --> 09:10.057
See, at the top we have our magic claws.

09:10.377 --> 09:14.618
I guess you know if you're gonna use that and... Maybe...

09:15.711 --> 09:17.693
What would happen if you use the gnome on Pero?

09:41.348 --> 09:45.855
You never know, and that's what makes it so much fun!

09:45.935 --> 09:49.480
You know, modern visual novels, they just don't really have this feature anymore.

09:51.667 --> 09:52.288
It's too bad.

09:52.468 --> 09:53.609
I like it.

09:53.669 --> 09:54.830
You know, it's exciting.

09:54.910 --> 09:59.754
You never know what's gonna happen in the hidden dialogues.

10:00.194 --> 10:04.398
But now I want to go and play more visual novels.

10:05.118 --> 10:06.820
Well, Ruffians!

10:06.940 --> 10:10.002
Have fun on the Peron road!

10:10.843 --> 10:11.844
Good luck!

10:12.224 --> 10:13.946
BAU BAU!

10:16.916 --> 10:20.118
Yeah, they don't make them quite like that, huh?

10:20.498 --> 10:21.919
Maybe that's a good thing, huh?

10:22.299 --> 10:22.979
No pedals.

10:23.139 --> 10:26.241
Oh, that just means we have to go back to Super Horse 5.

10:26.461 --> 10:26.941
Right.

10:27.602 --> 10:33.445
Wow, Ruffians!

10:33.865 --> 10:36.326
You know how FUWAMOCO we like to sing.

10:36.346 --> 10:36.927
We do.

10:38.550 --> 10:48.673
Well, actually, our most recent song cover of Speed's White Love has hit over 400k listens on YouTube!

10:48.893 --> 10:51.094
BAU BAU!

10:51.174 --> 10:52.514
Thank you!

10:52.814 --> 10:56.476
Thank you so much for listening to it and loving it a bunch!

10:56.556 --> 10:56.996
Right.

10:57.376 --> 11:04.698
You know, we were really nervous to release it, you know, since it might not be the most well-known song outside of Japan.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.319
But we're so happy that you like our cover!

11:07.859 --> 11:11.721
And that we were able to share a song that's really special to us together with you.

11:11.741 --> 11:19.404
You know, FUWAMOCO, we like to cover a bunch of different types of songs from many different decades.

11:19.724 --> 11:27.067
And, well, we'll continue to do that even though there might be some less known songs included in there too.

11:29.536 --> 11:33.839
We hope that you'll continue to look forward to more music from us, okay?

11:33.999 --> 11:38.302
You're happy to be introduced to it!

11:38.382 --> 11:40.443
Thank you, Ruffians!

11:40.543 --> 11:42.505
BAU BAU!

11:44.326 --> 11:45.007
So happy.

11:45.087 --> 11:46.868
I wonder when our next song cover will be.

11:47.472 --> 11:48.473
BAU BAU!

12:04.065 --> 12:19.310
FUWAMOCO, the day has already started off on the right paw because just a few hours earlier, we had our first collab with Asuka-chan by playing Geoguessr all together on her channel!

12:19.330 --> 12:20.311
BAU BAU!

12:22.051 --> 12:23.692
I know, AZKi-senpai!

12:24.372 --> 12:26.593
She's a super pro at GeoGuessr.

12:26.713 --> 12:30.474
And you know, she even made some custom maps for us to try and guess where we were!

12:30.614 --> 12:35.715
It was our first time, but we had so much fun all together!

12:36.696 --> 12:44.038
You know, we visited Shinjuku Gyoen, a famous park in Shinjuku, and stopped by Coin Laundry Fuwawa Hut!

12:44.118 --> 12:45.818
My coin laundry!

12:45.858 --> 12:47.199
Not a perfect shirt!

12:47.379 --> 12:50.000
And of course, it was perfect.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.020
We ended up

12:52.464 --> 12:57.649
Our Holy Land Mystery Donut in Akihabara!

12:57.909 --> 12:58.190
BAU BAU!

12:58.210 --> 13:12.504
Yeah, it was really really fun, but one thing, one thing that we learned though, even though you know FUWAMOCO, we're not the best with maps, and not the best with directions, but

13:13.184 --> 13:18.689
As long as we can find a Mister Donut location, we can find our way around!

13:19.489 --> 13:20.730
Somehow, huh?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.092
I don't think we've been to that many Mister Donut locations.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.774
I don't know, I think we have.

13:25.034 --> 13:28.797
But then, when I think about it... Yeah.

13:29.237 --> 13:32.160
Yeah.

13:32.260 --> 13:34.822
It really was so much fun!

13:34.962 --> 13:38.344
We hope to play more with AZKi-senpai in the future too!

13:38.385 --> 13:39.986
Yeah, that would be nice.

13:40.226 --> 13:41.707
Would you like that, Ruffians?

13:43.129 --> 13:43.830
More geoguessr?

13:44.030 --> 13:45.771
It was really fun!

13:45.811 --> 13:47.632
I thought it was gonna be very scary.

13:47.772 --> 13:48.633
Right!

13:48.673 --> 13:52.335
Ruffians, we got a perfect score!

13:52.435 --> 13:54.317
Thanks to AZKi-senpai!

13:54.537 --> 13:56.018
We were just having too much fun.

13:56.038 --> 13:57.039
Who cares about the score, huh?

13:57.139 --> 13:57.599
It was fun!

13:57.619 --> 14:01.382
Thank you AZKi-senpai!

14:01.422 --> 14:04.063
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

14:11.169 --> 14:14.292
The perfect way to start the day right.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.433
BAU BAU!

14:16.974 --> 14:18.555
Wow, Ruffians!

14:18.615 --> 14:20.497
We actually got a scoop!

14:20.517 --> 14:21.898
From you!

14:21.958 --> 14:23.199
Thank you!

14:23.339 --> 14:28.583
Thank you so much to Mr. BAU BAU for the impeccable journal!

14:28.883 --> 14:30.285
BAU BAU!

14:30.305 --> 14:32.446
Well, let's see what we have for the scoop.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.548
We have... De-den!

14:35.829 --> 14:37.711
It looks like Kaori-senpai has just...

14:38.271 --> 14:39.632
A big milestone!

14:39.652 --> 14:43.155
1,000 videos on her channel!

14:43.195 --> 14:45.717
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

14:45.757 --> 14:47.579
Congratulations!

14:47.839 --> 14:50.121
That's a huge accomplishment.

14:50.141 --> 14:51.142
1,000 videos!

14:55.241 --> 14:57.624
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

14:57.664 --> 14:58.064
BAU BAU!

14:58.245 --> 15:02.810
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

15:14.263 --> 15:16.445
So many hours, so much love, right?

15:16.605 --> 15:18.626
Right, and all the memories, too.

15:19.146 --> 15:22.729
Yeah, a thousand memories.

15:22.749 --> 15:24.310
20 of those, just 20?

15:25.010 --> 15:25.290
Just 20?

15:26.531 --> 15:26.951
I wonder.

15:27.452 --> 15:30.113
Many, many hours, though, definitely.

15:30.734 --> 15:35.597
Yeah, but FUWAMOCO, you know, we're just newbies, too, but...

15:36.738 --> 15:44.427
Seeing this kind of big accomplishment makes us really want to work hard too so that one day maybe we can hit that milestone too.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.249
Let's try not to rush.

15:46.609 --> 15:50.093
BAU BAU!

15:50.134 --> 15:54.418
Congratulations!

15:54.499 --> 15:55.860
BAU BAU!

15:57.099 --> 15:57.659
BAU BAU!

15:57.699 --> 15:57.859
Well...

16:16.270 --> 16:17.071
Ruffians!

16:17.932 --> 16:20.414
Did you see on Twitter the other day?

16:20.434 --> 16:27.080
We sort of shared a post about a Mococo Christ kid figure!

16:27.180 --> 16:29.462
That was still a work in progress, right?

16:29.862 --> 16:32.184
It was amazing, right?

16:32.825 --> 16:38.730
Yeah, well, Ruffians actually the creators shared support of data photos!

16:39.230 --> 16:43.514
It's not just Moco-chan, but also me as well!

16:44.875 --> 16:49.558
I guess Pero's dead too, huh?

16:49.858 --> 16:52.460
What an amazing prototype pie!

16:52.520 --> 16:53.861
Look at it!

16:54.602 --> 16:57.744
Well, Ruffians, maybe you're like, I need more!

16:58.084 --> 16:58.745
These photos!

17:05.212 --> 17:15.478
Ruffians, if you're interested in the area, you can actually see them on display in person at this weekend's Wonder Festival event happening in Japan.

17:15.698 --> 17:22.061
In case, you know, there are some Ruffians wondering just what Garage Kitchen, what Wonder Festival is.

17:23.041 --> 17:28.222
A garage kit or a resin kit is often a fan-made model that you assemble yourself.

17:28.763 --> 17:30.043
It's often made of resin.

17:30.243 --> 17:31.303
Makes sense, huh?

17:31.503 --> 17:32.043
You know?

17:32.263 --> 17:36.745
So that means that usually it just comes unpainted, unassembled parts.

17:37.225 --> 17:39.425
And you put that all together yourself.

17:39.545 --> 17:39.965
Okay.

17:40.465 --> 17:41.146
It's tricky.

17:41.166 --> 17:47.847
You need to put all the pins and glues and paints and equipment.

17:48.327 --> 17:49.768
Safety precautions.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.559
Not something that FUWAMOCO can do.

17:53.860 --> 17:54.000
No.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.761
Although that'd be fun.

17:56.602 --> 18:05.648
But, you know, at Wonder Festival, at this event, you can find many types of these kind of figure kits, but also, much much more.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.288
Much more!

18:07.429 --> 18:10.591
You know, you can find whatever the imagination dreams of.

18:10.951 --> 18:15.634
Whether it's monsters, or animals, or anime figures.

18:16.155 --> 18:17.155
Lots of things!

18:17.215 --> 18:19.657
Much, much, much more!

18:19.697 --> 18:22.579
You know, it's almost like an art museum where you can take a picture.

18:22.719 --> 18:23.759
Lots of stuff to look at!

18:40.586 --> 18:45.150
Well, FUWAMOCO, you know we talked about it before, but we really love figures.

18:45.491 --> 18:45.791
We do!

18:45.911 --> 18:49.434
And we've seen the amazing creativity from everyone, too.

18:49.855 --> 19:00.264
So even if you can't go to the venue, if you're interested, you can check out the hashtag, hashtag WF2024W on Twitter to see more from Wonder Festival.

19:00.304 --> 19:01.185
There's so much, okay?

19:01.265 --> 19:01.385
Yeah.

19:03.967 --> 19:08.168
Thank you so much for the amazing FUWAMOCO prototype kit!

19:08.569 --> 19:09.749
BAU BAU!

19:09.769 --> 19:11.029
Really, really impressive.

19:11.149 --> 19:11.710
Yeah.

19:11.770 --> 19:14.851
We really wanna get our paws on it one day.

19:15.511 --> 19:15.971
Just look.

19:16.331 --> 19:17.671
Just look for now, okay?

19:17.691 --> 19:18.992
Just for now, okay.

19:19.012 --> 19:22.953
BAU BAU!

19:22.973 --> 19:23.333
Thank you!

19:24.654 --> 19:25.414
So cool!

19:25.434 --> 19:26.274
Right?

19:26.474 --> 19:27.114
Amazing.

19:27.214 --> 19:28.455
BAU BAU!

19:28.575 --> 19:30.195
BAU BAU!

19:37.250 --> 19:38.290
It's been a while, huh?

19:38.370 --> 19:46.453
It's been a little while, but... There's been a misunderstanding.

19:46.473 --> 19:46.553
Yeah.

19:47.573 --> 19:49.353
FUWAMOCO!

19:49.934 --> 19:52.294
It's not... I didn't do this, Moco-chan.

19:52.554 --> 19:53.895
I didn't do anything either.

19:53.915 --> 19:55.675
It's just a misunderstanding, okay?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.756
It's a misunderstanding.

19:56.776 --> 19:57.956
Yeah.

19:58.296 --> 19:59.156
Ruffians!

19:59.637 --> 20:03.878
We noticed that there are some of you who think that

20:05.285 --> 20:13.956
FUWAMOCO, we might be planning out and scripting our streams, but especially our game streams in particular!

20:14.457 --> 20:20.084
First, you know, with the plan sinking, and now scripting of our game streams.

20:22.233 --> 20:27.237
Well, um, unfortunately, we do not script our game streams.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.159
That would be an interesting idea though, huh?

20:30.259 --> 20:30.919
Right.

20:31.700 --> 20:32.280
Yeah.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.741
It's all planned!

20:34.161 --> 20:34.962
Right!

20:34.982 --> 20:40.226
We'd have to be genius puppies, but no, we don't plan what happens.

20:41.126 --> 20:43.468
We don't plan how many times we die.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.309
We die many, many times.

20:45.649 --> 20:46.510
You know that.

20:46.930 --> 20:50.533
And we don't know what kind of silly things we're gonna get ourselves into.

20:51.594 --> 21:02.799
You know, well, in fact, you know, we generally know next to nothing about the majority of the games we're playing since, you know, most of them are playing for the first time.

21:03.159 --> 21:04.360
We don't know spoilers.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.420
Spoilers are fun.

21:07.771 --> 21:09.773
Even, you know, we played Bread and Bread.

21:09.793 --> 21:12.075
I don't really know what it's gonna be.

21:12.195 --> 21:12.655
I know.

21:12.675 --> 21:13.836
This is gonna be fun.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.598
It's gonna be fun, I just know that.

21:15.778 --> 21:16.058
Yeah.

21:16.178 --> 21:16.959
Is that a spoiler?

21:17.019 --> 21:17.800
I don't think so.

21:18.740 --> 21:18.941
Yeah.

21:18.961 --> 21:20.362
But you know what?

21:20.382 --> 21:25.906
Usually we'll see if we have some sort of knowledge of the game, you know, like Touhou or if we've played it before.

21:25.967 --> 21:26.227
Right.

21:26.907 --> 21:35.555
Yeah, so, uh... Ruffians, if you can imagine, I think it'd be really hard to plan things out, you know?

21:35.895 --> 21:36.135
Right?

21:36.235 --> 21:44.042
Even if you have played the game before, you know, trying to get certain events to happen, I think it'd be really, really tricky, right?

21:44.603 --> 21:46.244
Just maybe hard!

21:46.304 --> 21:49.607
If anything, I'd like to see a VTuber who can try to do that hard.

21:49.647 --> 21:50.148
Right!

21:50.408 --> 21:51.509
It'd be really rough, but...

21:52.009 --> 21:54.570
Crazy dedication, huh?

21:54.630 --> 21:55.590
Can you imagine?

21:56.230 --> 22:01.712
Trying to plan out an 8 hour stream of Power World with Metal Gear Solid, huh?

22:02.252 --> 22:04.093
Impressiveness only, right?

22:05.893 --> 22:07.054
Genius planners.

22:07.934 --> 22:10.695
I don't know what's gonna happen.

22:11.195 --> 22:12.156
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

22:30.779 --> 22:35.542
But yes, unfortunately FUWAMOCO, we're just seriously silly.

22:37.023 --> 22:43.987
Sometimes it might be hard to believe, but these are just the hazards we get ourselves into naturally.

22:44.128 --> 22:44.988
We're just silly.

22:45.528 --> 22:45.969
Got it.

22:47.310 --> 22:47.970
Understood.

22:49.631 --> 22:50.792
Seriously silly.

22:51.596 --> 22:51.876
Sorry!

22:51.897 --> 22:52.918
We're just shooting!

22:52.958 --> 22:55.383
Just shooting!

22:55.463 --> 22:56.505
BAU BAU!

23:06.851 --> 23:07.351
Moco-chan!

23:07.452 --> 23:12.197
It's time for the Doggie of the Day!

23:12.217 --> 23:14.299
It's time for the Doggie of the Day!

23:14.359 --> 23:17.122
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day of today is.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.243
We have De-den!

23:18.343 --> 23:19.685
It's Moco!

23:26.371 --> 23:29.874
I feel like Rogue is such a fitting name, right?

23:29.974 --> 23:33.036
I love the eyebrows!

23:33.076 --> 23:35.358
Big ears, big tongue!

23:35.378 --> 23:37.779
Yeah, and we have the little polka dot!

23:37.820 --> 23:40.321
Polka dot on the side there.

23:41.842 --> 23:44.444
She looks like such a big, cuddly puppy!

23:44.544 --> 23:45.165
Right!

23:45.185 --> 23:48.087
Yeah, strong doggo, strong Rogue!

23:48.507 --> 23:49.368
Tag twice!

23:49.388 --> 23:55.272
Yeah, apparently, you know, she's not really allowed on the couch it seems, but...

23:56.260 --> 24:02.443
Well, it sure looks like she's pretending that she's not that familiar with the rules, huh?

24:02.603 --> 24:06.325
There's a rule I'm not supposed to go on the couch.

24:06.885 --> 24:08.286
No sofa for me.

24:08.586 --> 24:09.607
Well, nobody's here.

24:09.687 --> 24:10.067
I'm sure.

24:10.147 --> 24:12.848
Well, I'll just kind of snuggle up to you.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.769
There's a spot.

24:13.969 --> 24:14.569
All right.

24:14.649 --> 24:17.110
It looks like it says BAU BAU.

24:17.211 --> 24:17.671
All right.

24:17.771 --> 24:18.491
Hi!

24:19.372 --> 24:21.313
Well, how does BAU BAU look?

24:21.413 --> 24:22.213
BAU BAU!

24:26.863 --> 24:27.785
BAU BAU!

24:27.805 --> 24:28.045
BAU BAU!

24:28.105 --> 24:28.406
I think so.

24:43.479 --> 24:46.741
You know, Moco was once a little puppy.

24:47.281 --> 24:51.483
And now, now she's a big puppy!

24:51.863 --> 24:56.665
She's grown up lots and I'm sure her love for you has too.

24:57.305 --> 24:59.987
Please give her lots of head pats.

25:00.047 --> 25:05.169
Let her follow you around wherever life takes you, okay?

25:05.329 --> 25:08.570
I can tell she wants to be by your side no matter what.

25:08.671 --> 25:10.511
The puppy heart doesn't go away, okay?

25:12.253 --> 25:19.658
That even means if that takes her to getting in trouble for being on the sofa too.

25:21.799 --> 25:24.781
She'll get in trouble if it means she gets to be close to you.

25:26.001 --> 25:27.642
BAU BAU!

25:27.782 --> 25:28.043
Cute!

25:32.766 --> 25:37.613
And for today I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

25:40.897 --> 25:42.720
Some pretty flowers!

25:42.960 --> 25:44.783
Interesting clouds too!

25:45.183 --> 25:48.908
It's a bit hard to see, but... Yeah, it looks maybe like it's a bit stormy, but...

25:49.369 --> 25:49.829
Really cool.

25:49.869 --> 25:54.032
It kind of matches with the fluffiness of the flowers, the fluffiness of the clouds.

25:54.052 --> 26:00.197
You have some purple flowers, and some greenish flowers, and some grayish flowers.

26:00.217 --> 26:06.761
You know, it looks like you also have the perfect friend joining you on that walk too!

26:07.742 --> 26:11.144
Thank you for accompanying this Ruffian booboo!

26:11.184 --> 26:11.665
BAU BAU!

26:15.748 --> 26:20.913
And for today's Question of the Day, we have... De-den!

26:21.474 --> 26:22.795
Cute!

26:23.156 --> 26:24.497
FUWAMOCO!

26:24.978 --> 26:26.499
Question!

26:26.920 --> 26:33.486
If you could travel in time to 3000 BC, what item would you bring with you and how would you use it?

26:33.827 --> 26:34.027
Me?

26:34.447 --> 26:36.309
I'd bring my phone to take selfies.

26:38.528 --> 26:43.010
Oh, that's a tricky question, but... I like the cellphone idea.

26:43.050 --> 26:44.350
It's a pretty good idea, I think.

26:44.430 --> 26:44.591
Right?

26:44.751 --> 26:47.732
You know, taking lots of photos and selfies, that would be fun.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.073
Just like this here!

26:50.173 --> 26:51.633
So cute.

26:51.953 --> 26:53.874
I don't think the photo spot's so high.

26:54.494 --> 26:55.615
You have to make your own.

26:55.775 --> 26:56.455
Yeah.

26:56.495 --> 27:01.777
Moco-chan, what would you bring?

27:02.417 --> 27:05.818
Maybe a big jug of water.

27:05.838 --> 27:07.379
Is this one?

27:09.003 --> 27:11.566
I can carry one in each arm.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.168
I feel like I would get thirsty.

27:14.188 --> 27:17.372
What if you're getting chased by like a wild animal or something?

27:17.452 --> 27:18.713
I'll just throw it at them.

27:19.354 --> 27:21.256
Two ways of cheating!

27:25.103 --> 27:26.284
I guess it did say one.

27:26.304 --> 27:27.725
Which item?

27:28.106 --> 27:29.927
Not how many of the item.

27:30.007 --> 27:31.869
I'm gonna bring two, okay?

27:32.790 --> 27:35.272
I don't know if that's allowed.

27:35.352 --> 27:37.053
Okay, two jugs of water.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.275
Yes, two jugs of water!

27:39.596 --> 27:41.277
And then you won't be thirsty?

27:41.317 --> 27:41.497
Yeah.

27:41.918 --> 27:42.698
For a little while?

27:42.919 --> 27:43.079
Yeah.

27:43.922 --> 27:44.202
Cool.

27:44.622 --> 27:49.746
I think I want to bring a book that teaches me the local language, maybe.

27:50.026 --> 27:54.468
That way I can communicate and maybe it could also include some skills, like good life skills.

27:54.969 --> 28:00.752
You know, like maybe how to use my fluff to make clothing.

28:00.772 --> 28:02.493
Those kinds of things, you know?

28:02.553 --> 28:04.114
Jugs of water!

28:04.174 --> 28:06.856
I don't know.

28:06.996 --> 28:09.698
I like to survive and be comfy.

28:10.118 --> 28:11.219
You know, and just enjoy my time.

28:11.259 --> 28:12.920
I like to survive on water.

28:15.386 --> 28:16.546
I don't know.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.507
I think I could survive, too, without some jugs of water.

28:21.167 --> 28:25.548
Well, if you need water, you know where to find me, huh?

28:25.688 --> 28:26.949
BAU BAU!

28:27.329 --> 28:28.629
Water like you, Ruffians.

28:28.669 --> 28:29.669
What would you bring?

28:30.029 --> 28:31.350
A barrel of salt?

28:32.330 --> 28:32.790
Water!

28:32.810 --> 28:37.871
Are you just saying that Fuwawa is very salty?

28:40.292 --> 28:41.052
I have fluff.

28:41.312 --> 28:41.932
I'm gonna make

28:43.743 --> 28:44.663
BAU BAU!

28:45.124 --> 28:48.524
Thank you, Ruffians!

28:49.045 --> 28:52.646
Thank you always for all your submissions.

28:52.946 --> 29:03.088
Remember, you're a very important part of FUWAMOCO Morning, so thank you always for waking up so that hopefully we can start your day on the right paw.

29:03.508 --> 29:04.849
And thank you also for

29:05.529 --> 29:09.813
If you have any submissions, please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

29:09.853 --> 29:10.333
BAU BAU!

29:10.373 --> 29:11.474
BAU BAU!

29:11.694 --> 29:14.317
For our next stream coming up, we have De-den!

29:30.691 --> 29:39.757
It feels like it's been forever, but today we'll be meeting up with Advent to play Palworld tonight!

29:39.837 --> 29:41.178
BAU BAU!

29:41.218 --> 29:42.419
Has it been more than a week?

29:42.799 --> 29:44.901
I feel like it's really been forever.

29:45.942 --> 29:49.064
What did we do last Friday?

29:50.140 --> 29:51.241
It might be grumpy.

29:51.261 --> 29:53.622
A little bit more than grumpy.

30:10.711 --> 30:12.792
They might be reduced to bones, but we'll find out!

30:13.433 --> 30:15.294
And remember, Ruffians!

30:15.655 --> 30:19.297
The collab today is going to be a little bit earlier than usual.

30:19.657 --> 30:27.263
It's going to be at 4pm PT and 9am JST, so make sure you don't show up two hours later than that.

30:27.543 --> 30:28.964
Yeah, I didn't make a mistake.

30:29.084 --> 30:29.364
Nope!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.627
BAU BAU!

30:33.467 --> 30:35.349
Let's take a look at our schedule!

30:36.269 --> 30:39.872
Well, this weekend we have another Rock n' Rawr Party!

30:39.892 --> 30:41.333
Time to rock!

30:41.433 --> 30:45.576
Yeah, and you know, it's Valentine's Day being next weekend.

30:47.437 --> 30:52.701
Well, I think you might be able to guess what songs we'll be singing, right?

30:53.141 --> 30:54.282
Love songs!

30:54.382 --> 30:56.483
BAU BAU!

30:56.523 --> 31:01.667
We'll make you feel all fluffy and fuzzy, so please join us, okay?

31:02.127 --> 31:02.928
BAU BAU!

31:04.476 --> 31:12.141
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

31:12.501 --> 31:19.045
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
