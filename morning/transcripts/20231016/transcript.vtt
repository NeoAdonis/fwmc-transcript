00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:08.460
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.402
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:16.065
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:18.266
BAU BAU!

00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:21.709
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.551
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:27.473
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:27.513 --> 00:05:28.013
BAU BAU!

00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:36.480
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.043
Thank you for joining us today for the 32nd episode!

00:05:41.063 --> 00:05:41.143
32nd.

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:42.524
Is that short?

00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:43.685
32nd, that's right.

00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:45.386
32nd, is that short today, huh?

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:46.507
Not the 32nd episode!

00:05:46.607 --> 00:05:48.589
It's very, very short format.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:49.069
Goodbye!

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:55.198
Goodbye!

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:17.501
A short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:19.223
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:22.785
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:29.209
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:36.374
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:40.777
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:40.797 --> 00:06:41.297
BAU BAU!

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.021
It's not 30 seconds today.

00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:47.101
No, not today.

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.922
Maybe another day.

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:55.287
Has there been any Ruffians?

00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:55.807
Ruffians!

00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:57.588
Have you seen Perroccino?

00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:59.109
I think there's been some sightings.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.630
Some?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.170
Some?

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.911
Let's see where we found them again!

00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:02.051
De-den!

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:12.965
It seems like maybe Pero's gone to a very far away place.

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:16.730
A vacation maybe?

00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:24.580
At least, I guess this Ruffian must have went on a fun vacation and spotted Pero at some ancient ruins.

00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:26.348
I don't know.

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:27.489
What's he doing?

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.290
Exploring!

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.270
Exploring!

00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:30.211
I don't know.

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:35.074
Do you think that maybe he saw us playing Amnesia and Foreborn together with Advent?

00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:37.536
Maybe he felt inspired for adventure?

00:07:37.556 --> 00:07:39.077
I don't know!

00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:41.973
I don't think it's a really good idea, huh?

00:07:42.793 --> 00:07:49.696
You know, bad things can happen when you go adventuring in ancient and undisturbed tombs, you know?

00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:53.017
But, I don't know, he does look very into it.

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:55.638
Yeah, it's good to have fun, right?

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:59.679
Look at the getup he has!

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:02.080
Maybe he just really likes ancient history.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.000
Maybe.

00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:09.842
It seems like Pero has a whip there, too.

00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:11.022
I don't think he needs that.

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:12.723
That's just a bad idea, too.

00:08:13.123 --> 00:08:16.144
His tongue is bad enough in the first place, too.

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:19.424
You know, but he could just use that to save himself, you know.

00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:20.445
Tongue, yeah.

00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:22.545
Or maybe fly away, too.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:26.386
But I guess Pero is pretty heavy for his tiny little wings, right?

00:08:26.966 --> 00:08:28.147
Yeah.

00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:35.270
Pero's kind of more... He's the kind of Pero... The kind of Pero that would rather take the easier way to travel, I think.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.992
Especially in the hot place like this, right?

00:08:40.752 --> 00:08:45.134
Hopefully those wounds are everything he hopes and dreams for.

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.575
And hopefully he doesn't bring a curse back to us.

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:48.976
Pero Jones.

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.257
He doesn't have a last name.

00:08:50.317 --> 00:08:51.077
He's just Pero.

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:51.317
Pero.

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.237
Pero is Pero.

00:08:52.317 --> 00:08:53.458
Perroccino.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.699
Perroccino.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:55.579
Full name.

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:57.935
BAU BAU!

00:08:57.955 --> 00:08:58.596
Thank you!

00:08:58.696 --> 00:09:02.497
We hope, Ruffian, that you didn't spot anything else disturbing at the moon.

00:09:02.517 --> 00:09:04.577
The only disturbing thing is Peron.

00:09:05.137 --> 00:09:06.438
Peron is get up there.

00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:10.159
BAU BAU!

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:12.839
Ruffians!

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.680
Do you know what happened recently?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.901
Ruffians!

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:18.701
Ruffians!

00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:20.662
Guess what?

00:09:20.962 --> 00:09:21.542
Guess what?

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:26.236
Yesterday, we reached a really big milestone!

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:26.356
Yeah!

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.056
We reached 600,000 Ruffians!

00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:27.276
Ruffians!

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:28.197
YouTube subscribers!

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:28.757
Thank you so much!

00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:29.618
Thank you so much!

00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:40.265
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:46.186
We're so thankful for all your support during these last two months since we debuted.

00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:48.567
There's been so many fun things we've done together.

00:09:49.107 --> 00:09:56.029
And somehow it feels a lot longer than two months, but also sort of strangely short at the same time.

00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:57.949
It feels like an in-between.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.130
Do you know what we mean by that?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.231
Ruffians, do you feel the same?

00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:04.031
It's long.

00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:07.752
A lot's happened, but it's also gone by really fast.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:10.806
Do you feel that way?

00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:11.887
It's weird, right?

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:12.427
It's weird.

00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:14.909
Yeah.

00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.850
Long but short.

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:18.072
Time is funny, huh?

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:23.716
Ruffians, we're really so happy to have you here with us.

00:10:23.736 --> 00:10:28.340
We hope that you'll continue to let us protect your smiles for many, many years to come.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.000
Is that okay?

00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:32.023
Do we have your permission?

00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:40.231
Hopefully we can make our family of Ruffians even bigger!

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:48.282
Even bigger.

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.465
Maybe we can get to 1 million subscribers.

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:54.207
Another big dream.

00:10:54.547 --> 00:10:56.248
But first, let's aim for 700,000.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:56.689
BAU BAU!

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:57.069
Big, big dream.

00:10:57.109 --> 00:10:58.270
Thank you!

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.311
BAU BAU! 600,000.

00:11:10.563 --> 00:11:16.252
It doesn't feel real, but there's more happy things!

00:11:17.494 --> 00:11:24.406
We had some pretty cool announcements yesterday, but in case you missed it, we have...

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:30.299
Halloween Party together with Advent!

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:33.282
We announced it during our collab with Advent yesterday, right?

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:39.870
Yeah, we're gonna be having a big party, a big celebration leading up to Halloween Eve.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.516
Yeah, we have a bunch of fun and spooky themes and activities coming.

00:11:46.257 --> 00:11:50.499
I feel really curious about Shiori's pumpkin carving.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.260
Tonight is 7pm, right?

00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:54.442
7pm PT.

00:11:54.702 --> 00:11:57.003
I wonder what kind of pumpkin she's chosen, right?

00:11:57.403 --> 00:11:58.784
And what she'll be carving in it.

00:11:58.824 --> 00:12:00.685
There's a lot of different types of pumpkins.

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:06.068
Yeah, because depending on the type of pumpkin you get, it can really change what you can do in the design zone.

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:11.612
I'm sort of curious if it's a tall pumpkin or a short pumpkin, a big one or a small one.

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:12.772
The white pumpkins too.

00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:20.630
We'll also be having another announcement next Sunday!

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.613
And finally, on Halloween Eve,

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.845
We're gonna be having a Halloween costume party!

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:33.386
On the 31st.

00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:34.547
Is that Halloween Eve?

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:35.267
It is!

00:12:35.627 --> 00:12:38.470
It's not the Eve before Halloween?

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.190
No.

00:12:41.232 --> 00:12:42.213
I'm confused.

00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:55.284
But for our Halloween party, we'd really like it if you could share your spooky and funny Halloween hololive costumes with us using the hashtag #AdventCostumeParty.

00:12:55.704 --> 00:12:56.505
And you know what?

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:57.605
BAU BAU!

00:12:57.645 --> 00:12:58.026
BAU BAU!

00:12:58.046 --> 00:12:58.526
BAU BAU!

00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:08.162
I'm interested.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:15.828
But you know, if it's okay... If it's okay, Ruffians, we'd also like to dress up too.

00:13:16.248 --> 00:13:25.856
So if you have some cute ideas, maybe you could draw us a costume that we might wear during the stream and submit it with our hashtag.

00:13:26.436 --> 00:13:27.097
Hashtag.

00:13:27.117 --> 00:13:29.839
DressUpFWMC.

00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:30.139
Will you?

00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:38.917
I'm sure there's a lot of good costume designing Ruffians out there.

00:13:39.457 --> 00:13:43.801
Yeah, but you can find pictures of us that you can draw on top of on Twitter too.

00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:49.407
Just make sure that the costume is trans- The costume is transparent?

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.390
No.

00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:52.651
That thought.

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.234
Image is transparent.

00:13:55.754 --> 00:13:56.975
And the costume is there.

00:13:57.596 --> 00:13:58.156
Yeah!

00:13:58.596 --> 00:13:58.957
Yeah!

00:13:59.437 --> 00:14:00.078
Yeah!

00:14:00.098 --> 00:14:03.741
I stopped myself.

00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:04.061
Yeah.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.882
Are you proud of it?

00:14:05.902 --> 00:14:06.163
Safe.

00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:06.763
Safe!

00:14:07.164 --> 00:14:07.984
Wasn't safe!

00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:08.785
Yes!

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.567
BAU BAU!

00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:16.711
Well, Ruffians, there's a little bit of news.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.020
News.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.582
Maybe it's not quite the news you want, but... It's news.

00:14:22.002 --> 00:14:22.582
There's news.

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:26.844
There's been some advancements in BAU BAU, Biou.

00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:30.205
But it's not the good kind of advancements.

00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:32.246
No...

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:41.205
You know, some Ruffians have been reporting that they've been experiencing serious nightmares recently.

00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:47.890
The ones of a world without color and with a flower that's not quite right.

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:53.094
What do you mean Ruffians not quite right?

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:56.216
Fuwawa is always Fuwawa!

00:14:56.237 --> 00:14:56.477
Right!

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.759
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:06.403
You know, but Ruffians keep on muttering strange things like business as usual.

00:15:06.423 --> 00:15:17.389
You know, I don't really know what it means, but it makes me feel sort of uneasy and a bit annoyed at the same time.

00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:19.050
It's usual.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.911
Usual?

00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:20.451
Usual.

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:22.629
Ruffians!

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:23.689
It's BAU BAU.

00:15:23.909 --> 00:15:24.510
BAU BAU!

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.430
BAU BAU!

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.290
BAU BAU!

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.070
BAU BAU!

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.091
BAU BAU!

00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:31.631
BAU BAU!

00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:32.651
BAU BAU!

00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:34.151
BAU BAU!

00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:35.472
I'm concerned.

00:15:36.572 --> 00:15:37.012
BAU BAU.

00:15:39.613 --> 00:15:40.733
BAU BAU!

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:42.173
BAU BAU.

00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:46.474
I hope the Ruffians are okay.

00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:51.015
Ruffians, maybe you just need to get some good rest.

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:53.116
Maybe the bad dreams will start to go away.

00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:54.958
Exercise too!

00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:58.020
You know, maybe we should let the Ruffians get some rest.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.723
Sorry for all your wanting to play.

00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:05.406
Will that make the BAU BAU view get better?

00:16:05.426 --> 00:16:05.526
Maybe!

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.750
Ruffians!

00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:43.848
Uh, there's... there's a misunderstanding again.

00:16:43.868 --> 00:16:45.255
Again.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.967
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:25.531
Unfortunately, Moco-chan wasn't really able to get over 3,000 and had to read a kind of embarrassing phrase.

00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:27.592
They did.

00:17:28.252 --> 00:17:28.953
Yeah, I know.

00:17:29.813 --> 00:17:33.435
Ruffians, you're calling Moco-chan a baby?

00:17:33.455 --> 00:17:37.618
Moco-chan, maybe you bubble bubble too hard.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:40.380
No.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.581
I'm not a baby.

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:49.788
I may get emotional and maybe I cry sometimes.

00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:56.609
I might miss you and be needy sometimes.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.430
But you know it!

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.950
You have eyes!

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.730
You have a brain, Ruffians!

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.791
At least you should.

00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:05.371
You know it!

00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:07.752
I'm a demon guard dog.

00:18:08.592 --> 00:18:09.692
I'm not a baby.

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:11.452
I'm not Fuwawa.

00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:13.233
I'm Mococo.

00:18:13.973 --> 00:18:14.313
Okay.

00:18:15.379 --> 00:18:17.740
Don't you misunderstand anything, okay?

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.961
I'm a full-grown puppy!

00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:21.921
Yeah!

00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:23.062
Got it.

00:18:24.662 --> 00:18:25.702
Yeah, right?

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:26.983
You have a brain!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.883
Put those bottles away, Ruffians!

00:18:29.864 --> 00:18:31.244
We don't need the bottles here!

00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:31.324
Huh?

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:33.645
Huh?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.260
No baby, just a little sister.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:36.900
That's two.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:37.781
That is two.

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.461
I am a full grown puppy, okay?

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:44.802
I'm a full grown little sister.

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:45.402
Understood?

00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:48.903
It looks like the Ruffians have mainly understood.

00:18:50.503 --> 00:18:51.063
You better.

00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:52.504
You better!

00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:55.524
Cause I'm warning you, this is a threat.

00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:56.565
Got it!

00:18:57.605 --> 00:18:58.405
I got it.

00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.766
I'm glad at least you have it, Fuwawa.

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:02.866
Yeah.

00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:06.907
BAU BAU!

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.193
Only happy stuff now, right?

00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:15.197
Ruffians!

00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:21.705
We just wanted to let you know, but you might be in trouble.

00:19:22.967 --> 00:19:23.548
Just maybe.

00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:25.189
A little bit of trouble.

00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:26.129
Just maybe.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:34.796
You know, when Moco-chan mentioned that she likes to peek at the Ruffians' Twitter accounts, a couple of FUWAMOCO mornings ago, right?

00:19:35.456 --> 00:19:37.418
And I got a lot of response from you!

00:19:37.438 --> 00:19:39.720
Yeah.

00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:47.826
A couple of Ruffians here, they're kind of concerned about what we might be seeing on their accounts.

00:19:56.651 --> 00:20:04.312
Well... We might have some bad news for you!

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:09.133
You're in even more danger!

00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:11.634
Danger!

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:13.694
It's not our fault.

00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:18.195
You know, now Twitter is showing us your tweets.

00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:20.332
From Ruffians.

00:20:20.973 --> 00:20:23.275
Right on our timeline regularly.

00:20:23.776 --> 00:20:24.877
In the 4U feed.

00:20:24.937 --> 00:20:26.399
You're in danger!

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:29.082
Twitter is exposing you!

00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.525
Without us doing anything!

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:33.487
So you have to watch out!

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.069
You never know what we might see.

00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:36.149
Why?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.049
Why?

00:20:37.129 --> 00:20:38.450
Twitter's showing us things.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.870
Yeah.

00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:43.832
But... Moco-chan, what was that?

00:20:44.152 --> 00:20:44.533
Nothing.

00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:46.653
It was nothing.

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:53.356
Well, Ruffians, you know, it does actually make us really happy to see you getting along so well together.

00:20:53.717 --> 00:20:55.017
Good friend, Ruffians.

00:20:55.137 --> 00:21:02.320
It's really nice, you know, when we take a peek at Twitter and we're kind of a little bit tired and we see you all so happy together.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.021
Yeah!

00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:07.422
You know, you should be proud of what you feel passionate about, right?

00:21:07.562 --> 00:21:09.903
You know, that's the FUWAMOCO way.

00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:10.463
You're good.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:30.976
You're good!

00:21:31.116 --> 00:21:35.399
I'm very worried about what you might be seeing.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:36.880
Why?

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:36.960
Why?

00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:41.062
Sometimes it's not our fault.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.484
Sometimes it's your fault.

00:21:44.164 --> 00:21:48.187
Keep this in mind, Ruffians!

00:21:48.227 --> 00:21:49.468
And sometimes it's Twitter's fault.

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:50.448
It's Twitter's fault.

00:21:51.008 --> 00:21:53.810
BAU BAU!

00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:56.332
It's a new week, Moco-chan.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.393
And a new week means a new challenge.

00:22:01.014 --> 00:22:01.855
Challenge ourselves.

00:22:03.036 --> 00:22:12.124
So today, you know, Moco-chan is going to challenge eating natto again for the sixth time.

00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:13.966
You know it's a spooky week.

00:22:15.207 --> 00:22:17.770
Maybe this is a little bit spooky to Moco-chan, you know.

00:22:18.591 --> 00:22:18.971
Right?

00:22:19.311 --> 00:22:20.773
It's spooky to my tummy.

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:28.801
To introduce what natto is, natto is fermented soybeans and it's a very common breakfast food in Japan.

00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:32.965
It's really healthy for you, but it's a little bit challenging.

00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:33.406
Wait, stop!

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:34.026
Wait, stop!

00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:35.288
Wait, stop!

00:22:35.488 --> 00:22:37.290
I have to prepare for- No, can you not!

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.751
Don't interrupt me!

00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:40.853
I'm trying to help you here.

00:22:41.714 --> 00:22:42.735
Am I helping me?

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:45.477
Moco-chan wants to eat it because it's really good for you.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:45.957
I do!

00:22:46.058 --> 00:22:47.499
And then she eats it every day!

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:47.759
I do it!

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:49.280
She can be like her older sister.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:49.880
I do it!

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.482
And protect the Ruffian smile for many many many years.

00:22:52.502 --> 00:22:53.263
I do want to eat it.

00:22:53.723 --> 00:23:03.911
But you know, it's just like... I just... It's like, you know... It's when you have to do something big.

00:23:04.291 --> 00:23:06.072
And you want to do it, you should do it.

00:23:06.133 --> 00:23:07.854
You know you want to do it, but you don't.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.603
It's nice and fluffy now.

00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:14.506
Nice and fluffy.

00:23:14.987 --> 00:23:16.128
I feel dizzy already.

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:22.295
Moco-chan, today... Today you're gonna eat it, right?

00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:22.595
No.

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:23.836
Yeah, I will eat it.

00:23:23.876 --> 00:23:29.002
Moco-chan, you've only... For recap, you've only got it in your mouth a little bit.

00:23:29.102 --> 00:23:29.863
I ate one.

00:23:29.903 --> 00:23:30.644
I will eat one.

00:23:31.064 --> 00:23:31.364
Really?

00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:33.305
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:34.365
Was that last time?

00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:35.305
I don't think so.

00:23:35.485 --> 00:23:36.526
But I have ate one.

00:23:36.546 --> 00:23:37.986
We took a step back last time.

00:23:38.406 --> 00:23:39.707
I did eat one.

00:23:39.747 --> 00:23:40.307
Ruffians.

00:23:40.607 --> 00:23:41.147
Ruffians!

00:23:42.268 --> 00:23:43.088
I did eat one.

00:23:43.468 --> 00:23:47.069
Just to remind you Moco-chan, Moco-chan- She did eat one once!

00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:47.989
She did eat one once!

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:48.630
I don't know.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.011
But Moco-chan told Anya-senpai that you would eat a bean for her today.

00:23:54.511 --> 00:23:58.633
So you need to ignore the fact that Anya-senpai is bad with natto too.

00:23:59.153 --> 00:23:59.493
Okay?

00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:01.997
Be stronger.

00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:03.800
Stronger.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.801
I am strong.

00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:07.364
I've gotten stronger, right Ruffian?

00:24:07.764 --> 00:24:09.847
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:11.970
It smells already getting to me.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.652
It smells good today.

00:24:14.272 --> 00:24:15.334
BAU Moco-chan!

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:16.135
First.

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:17.777
First Moco-chan.

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:22.066
We need to say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi.

00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:23.286
Thank you!

00:24:23.366 --> 00:24:25.867
They worked very hard to make this.

00:24:26.427 --> 00:24:27.848
I'm sorry, I'm not good at it.

00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:29.388
Here you go, Moco-chan.

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:34.230
Ow, it just bumped my elbow!

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:34.950
You know what?

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.432
The natto will make you feel better.

00:24:41.753 --> 00:24:43.013
Thank you, farmer-san.

00:24:43.093 --> 00:24:43.914
Thank you, yes.

00:24:44.014 --> 00:24:44.454
It hurt.

00:24:46.008 --> 00:24:48.270
I don't want to hurt you and make you feel better.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.192
I'm gonna be eating an ass of it.

00:24:51.232 --> 00:24:53.073
I'm not putting mayo on it.

00:24:53.413 --> 00:24:54.474
I really can't do this today.

00:24:54.514 --> 00:24:54.955
I really can't.

00:24:54.975 --> 00:24:57.336
Even just looking at the stickiness is making me want.

00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:58.937
It's nice and fluffy!

00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:00.118
I feel dizzy.

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:03.161
I made it nice and fluffy, Ruffians.

00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:16.030
I feel dizzy.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:16.970
You can do it!

00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:19.011
For Anya-senpai!

00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:25.235
You can do it, Moco-chan!

00:25:25.615 --> 00:25:28.937
It's your sixth time today, that means six weeks of this challenge.

00:25:28.997 --> 00:25:30.317
I do want to show improvement.

00:25:31.018 --> 00:25:32.459
I do really want to show improvement.

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:33.619
I took a step back last time.

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:34.400
Don't say that.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.781
You need to take a couple steps forward.

00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:39.122
I don't have tea though.

00:25:39.182 --> 00:25:39.983
No tea today.

00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:43.999
Okay, I'm picking up a bean, okay?

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:45.460
I'm picking up a bean!

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.600
Okay, she has one bean.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.661
Can you take two at least?

00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:48.721
No, no, no.

00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:50.422
Have confidence.

00:25:50.642 --> 00:25:51.323
Have confidence.

00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:52.203
I am trying!

00:25:52.863 --> 00:25:54.324
Do it for the Ruffians!

00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:55.305
Fight on!

00:25:55.325 --> 00:25:57.065
That's what I do every week, okay?

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:02.848
Moco-chan wants to inspire the Ruffians to challenge something hard too.

00:26:02.868 --> 00:26:03.789
That's why you're doing this.

00:26:03.809 --> 00:26:04.909
I picked up a bean, okay?

00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:05.790
Okay, she has a bean.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.611
In between the chopsticks.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.720
It's losing the fluffiness.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.581
You gotta hurry up.

00:26:13.621 --> 00:26:14.521
Start with one.

00:26:15.882 --> 00:26:16.842
We'll start with one.

00:26:17.622 --> 00:26:17.822
Yeah.

00:26:17.922 --> 00:26:18.523
Ikioide.

00:26:18.903 --> 00:26:19.823
Ikioide ikou.

00:26:21.383 --> 00:26:21.864
Just go.

00:26:22.124 --> 00:26:22.664
Just go.

00:26:24.024 --> 00:26:24.624
With force!

00:26:25.745 --> 00:26:26.105
Okay.

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:26.685
Passion.

00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:29.086
Force and passion will help you eat it.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.641
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:34.941
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

00:26:35.043 --> 00:26:40.387
Eat it, eat it, eat it!

00:26:40.407 --> 00:26:44.830
Try it, try it, try it!

00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:46.712
It has to touch your tongue!

00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:47.693
It is!

00:26:49.014 --> 00:26:51.356
Okay, okay, I'm taking the natto from you instead.

00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:52.296
No, no, no, no!

00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:53.357
Eat it!

00:26:53.537 --> 00:26:53.657
Ouch!

00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:53.878
Ouch!

00:26:58.221 --> 00:26:59.001
She's frozen.

00:27:00.562 --> 00:27:01.702
Moco-chan, eat it.

00:27:01.842 --> 00:27:02.222
Eat it!

00:27:03.303 --> 00:27:06.244
It's just sitting there.

00:27:07.345 --> 00:27:07.865
I tried.

00:27:08.865 --> 00:27:09.686
I didn't do it.

00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:13.748
Moco-chan.

00:27:14.288 --> 00:27:15.248
It just sat there.

00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:16.409
That's not how you eat.

00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:17.889
That's not how you eat.

00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:21.671
You don't put the food on your tongue.

00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:23.052
Just sit there.

00:27:24.772 --> 00:27:25.613
Mococo.

00:27:26.496 --> 00:27:27.596
Moco-chan.

00:27:28.137 --> 00:27:30.237
Another week of no progress.

00:27:31.838 --> 00:27:32.758
You can do it!

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:34.879
Okay, let's try another video.

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:35.479
Do it!

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:36.499
I'll get one.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.600
Oh, this is a small one.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.600
It's a small one, Moco-chan.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.200
No.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.941
Yeah!

00:27:41.561 --> 00:27:42.501
Yeah!

00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:43.441
You can do it.

00:27:43.701 --> 00:27:43.922
No.

00:27:44.582 --> 00:27:47.203
I'm, I think, I think, okay, Ruffians.

00:27:47.303 --> 00:27:49.323
I think I'm getting better with the taste, though.

00:27:49.683 --> 00:27:50.964
The aftertaste, at least.

00:27:52.168 --> 00:27:53.829
I think I'm slowly getting better, okay?

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:55.269
I found an extra small bean.

00:27:55.349 --> 00:27:55.709
No!

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.870
It's extra small!

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.571
I didn't fail it, okay?

00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:01.672
I didn't fail it because I think I'm getting better with the taste, okay?

00:28:02.532 --> 00:28:02.832
Moco-chan.

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:04.353
I think I'm getting better with the taste.

00:28:05.093 --> 00:28:05.873
Moco-chan.

00:28:05.913 --> 00:28:09.015
I think I just, um, maybe, uh, need more rest first.

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.838
Rest up before the natto marathon!

00:28:14.138 --> 00:28:16.300
This is not failure so far, okay?

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.801
I'm getting slowly better.

00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:18.701
Okay?

00:28:18.861 --> 00:28:23.705
It's just like... Moco-chan, if you don't hurry up, we're gonna have to discontinue this corner.

00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:26.947
It's just like... It's just like the pup talk, you know?

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:29.369
One step a week, okay?

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:30.970
I've taken six steps.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.692
I'm not there yet, but I'm taking steps.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:35.253
Okay?

00:28:36.154 --> 00:28:38.696
Moco-chan, should I show the Ruffians that I can eat it?

00:28:40.609 --> 00:28:41.591
It doesn't matter, no one cares.

00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:42.572
I'm gonna eat them!

00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:43.133
No one cares!

00:28:43.153 --> 00:28:44.436
Itadakimasu!

00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:47.120
No one cares.

00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:50.606
You're just eating food, no one cares.

00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:52.289
It's yummy.

00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:54.176
Stop.

00:28:54.537 --> 00:28:56.959
We have to continue FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:58.020
I can't eat it all.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.501
No!

00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:01.664
It's yummy, Ruffians!

00:29:02.505 --> 00:29:04.447
Thank you, Tochigi Farmers.

00:29:04.867 --> 00:29:07.910
And I'll continue eating Moco-chan's leftovers later.

00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:11.394
But Ruffians, please don't forget Moco-chan challenge.

00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:13.236
Something she's not great at.

00:29:13.256 --> 00:29:13.296
So...

00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:16.650
Be proud of me, okay?

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.251
Be proud of me, okay?

00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:20.433
I haven't had water, I haven't had tea.

00:29:20.693 --> 00:29:21.533
It's so yummy.

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:22.134
Good job, Fuwawa.

00:29:22.154 --> 00:29:22.794
Thank you.

00:29:23.054 --> 00:29:24.355
It's improvement, okay?

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.156
It's doing still.

00:29:26.176 --> 00:29:26.597
BAU BAU.

00:29:26.697 --> 00:29:29.638
It was an attempt.

00:29:29.658 --> 00:29:32.360
We have a Doggie of the Day!

00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:35.562
Important!

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:37.784
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:29:37.804 --> 00:29:41.126
This is Chika.

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:42.467
Chika!

00:29:45.092 --> 00:29:47.733
Look at that expression and that pose.

00:29:47.773 --> 00:29:48.573
That's shock.

00:29:49.414 --> 00:29:53.095
It kind of reminds me of like an amateur graphic model in a way.

00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:53.896
Why?

00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.737
The shot, the angle.

00:29:57.117 --> 00:29:59.798
The looking over the shoulder kind of.

00:30:01.139 --> 00:30:02.179
Right?

00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:03.960
Chika likes to eat tissues.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.842
Like Moco-chan.

00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:07.542
What?

00:30:08.162 --> 00:30:09.183
Whenever you sneeze.

00:30:10.503 --> 00:30:12.144
I don't eat tissues when I sneeze.

00:30:14.761 --> 00:30:15.842
We'll make noises!

00:30:15.862 --> 00:30:18.603
Moco-chan, you like to make noises too, right?

00:30:19.303 --> 00:30:20.783
I never make any noises.

00:30:22.044 --> 00:30:24.284
Not like the screams that you're making when we play with onions?

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:39.816
The last part there... I feel bad for Chica... I know... I know, Ralphine!

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:39.830
No

00:30:40.976 --> 00:30:43.719
You don't say those kind of things when they're obviously not true.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.280
Okay.

00:30:44.581 --> 00:30:46.082
Poor Chika.

00:30:46.603 --> 00:30:47.845
She's a lady.

00:30:47.905 --> 00:30:50.007
She's very, very polite, I'm sure.

00:30:50.027 --> 00:30:51.689
She does not do those things.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.091
Ruffians.

00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:53.812
Okay.

00:30:54.753 --> 00:30:55.374
Slander.

00:30:55.494 --> 00:30:56.776
Yeah, slander.

00:30:58.956 --> 00:31:01.318
Moco-chan, how do we think this is BAU BAU?

00:31:03.219 --> 00:31:04.601
I think she's sort of dainty.

00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:06.042
Dainty?

00:31:06.442 --> 00:31:08.364
She looks a bit shocked here, but dainty.

00:31:08.744 --> 00:31:09.445
BAU BAU!

00:31:09.585 --> 00:31:09.905
Really?

00:31:09.965 --> 00:31:13.067
I think it's more like a nice regular head jump.

00:31:13.127 --> 00:31:13.748
BAU BAU!

00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:14.649
No.

00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:15.690
Regular?

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.330
Regular.

00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.871
Maybe a bit regular.

00:31:19.432 --> 00:31:20.013
Standard.

00:31:20.293 --> 00:31:21.874
Standard.

00:31:22.194 --> 00:31:28.657
Well, you know, I think Chika really enjoys being the best mom that she can be for the camera.

00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:31.719
But, you know, obviously she's still kind of getting the hang of it.

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:33.599
You know, a few steps every day.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.301
But we love that expression though.

00:31:37.281 --> 00:31:38.102
It says a lot.

00:31:38.582 --> 00:31:39.422
It says so much.

00:31:39.442 --> 00:31:40.363
What do you think she's thinking?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.423
And for our next corner we have... Today I went on a walk

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.033
Let's see... De-den!

00:32:09.896 --> 00:32:10.597
Is this a walk?

00:32:11.359 --> 00:32:12.501
It's a walk, you know.

00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:15.652
A bit of a silly sight.

00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:20.834
Seems like a paint can fell off a truck and left a kind of an explosion.

00:32:20.854 --> 00:32:21.635
That's sort of scary.

00:32:21.655 --> 00:32:21.875
Right?

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.756
It's like, I don't know, yeah.

00:32:24.036 --> 00:32:26.837
Kind of scary, but intense and kind of cool too!

00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:27.457
Right?

00:32:27.497 --> 00:32:29.398
You don't really see this.

00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:30.339
New art.

00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:32.440
I hope everyone was safe though.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:32.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:37.102
You know, I don't really know how they can clean that up, but it's sort of special, you know?

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.123
Right?

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.464
I think if it was us walking by and

00:32:41.144 --> 00:32:41.464
BAU BAU!

00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:41.744
Thank you!

00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:15.170
I got a very good question from a Ruffian.

00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:21.078
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

00:33:21.258 --> 00:33:24.399
You guys mentioned that you also auditioned for hololive JP.

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:29.300
If you guys got into JP instead of EN, how different do you think your content would have been?

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.661
BAU BAU!

00:33:32.021 --> 00:33:33.342
It's a good question.

00:33:33.382 --> 00:33:34.282
Very interesting.

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:43.485
It's true, you know, we did audition for JP when auditions weren't open for EN, but we just wanted to be part of hololive, you know?

00:33:44.245 --> 00:33:45.966
But as for our content,

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:48.300
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.242
What do you think?

00:33:51.922 --> 00:33:53.163
Do you think it'll be that different?

00:33:53.183 --> 00:33:53.583
I'm curious.

00:33:55.244 --> 00:33:56.025
Alternate reality?

00:33:56.045 --> 00:33:59.247
A different world, my my!

00:33:59.587 --> 00:34:00.648
Much less English.

00:34:01.587 --> 00:34:07.011
Well, to tell the truth, I think it'd probably be the same.

00:34:07.031 --> 00:34:07.992
It'd probably be the same.

00:34:08.272 --> 00:34:11.654
Obviously, it'd be more often in Japanese than in English.

00:34:11.714 --> 00:34:12.014
Yeah.

00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:17.038
And we'd probably be a little more awkward and probably a little stiff, too.

00:34:17.418 --> 00:34:17.758
Yeah.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:22.181
When we speak Japanese, sometimes we can speak it a bit formally, a bit too formally.

00:34:22.722 --> 00:34:23.963
But we're trying to loosen up, too.

00:34:24.023 --> 00:34:24.483
Yeah.

00:34:24.603 --> 00:34:27.125
You know, of course, we make mistakes all the time as well.

00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:27.385
Yeah.

00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:28.206
You know, right?

00:34:29.427 --> 00:34:41.395
We've never tried playing a game and doing commentary in Japanese at the same time, so we don't really know if we'd be that good at it, but we'd like, you know, it'll be interesting.

00:34:42.435 --> 00:34:43.816
At the very least!

00:34:44.557 --> 00:34:51.221
We're really happy to be a part of hololive in the past, and we hope that we can make hololive even stronger!

00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:54.543
But we'd also like to be able to use our Japanese skills more.

00:34:55.544 --> 00:35:01.267
We really don't have much of an opportunity to do that, so we'd really like to if we could.

00:35:01.588 --> 00:35:05.130
After all, you know, it's a skill we have just like any other skill.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.831
We'd like to be able to make use of it, you know?

00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:09.752
Otherwise, it's just a waste!

00:35:11.733 --> 00:35:16.776
But we hope that we can bridge Holo JP and Holo EN together in the future, too!

00:35:17.036 --> 00:35:17.997
A little step still.

00:35:19.758 --> 00:35:27.843
BAU BAU!

00:35:28.984 --> 00:35:32.887
Thank you again, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

00:35:33.147 --> 00:35:36.429
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make all together.

00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:38.551
We're waiting, okay?

00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:40.392
We're waiting for your doggies.

00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:43.514
We're waiting for your vlogs, your questions.

00:35:44.014 --> 00:35:45.015
I'm Pero Sighting.

00:35:45.335 --> 00:35:47.517
Please don't forget to use the hashtag.

00:35:47.717 --> 00:35:51.160
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.041
BAU BAU!

00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:56.063
Well, let's take a look at our next dream.

00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:58.405
Our next dream we have...

00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:00.467
Donkey Kong Country.

00:36:00.507 --> 00:36:05.312
But first, tonight we're going to be taking it maybe a little bit easier.

00:36:05.332 --> 00:36:07.654
First, this is tomorrow Donkey Kong.

00:36:07.934 --> 00:36:10.476
But we're going to be recording a bunch of stuff too.

00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:15.761
But Ruffians, we would like to ask you to make sure to get lots of rest, okay?

00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:16.982
Well, we'll maybe try to.

00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:22.648
But like Moco-chan mentioned, we're going to be back tomorrow with Donkey Kong Country.

00:36:23.268 --> 00:36:28.632
Yeah, it never seems to have failed to make us turn into big monkeys and go a bit bananas.

00:36:29.313 --> 00:36:31.735
So, yeah, it can get pretty crazy.

00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:34.156
A bit crazy, a bit bananas.

00:36:34.517 --> 00:36:38.440
We hope we can get to even more levels next time!

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.300
We'll do our best.

00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:41.222
BAU BAU!

00:36:41.822 --> 00:36:42.803
And our schedule!

00:36:44.184 --> 00:36:52.730
We have a bunch of spooky streams coming up this week, but we're really looking forward to our FUWAMOCO Rock N' Roar Party!

00:36:53.090 --> 00:37:01.696
It's gonna be on Saturday, and this time, it's a Halloween special filled with songs that you might not really think of as Halloween songs.

00:37:01.756 --> 00:37:03.197
Oh, but they're still spooky songs.

00:37:03.377 --> 00:37:04.878
Definitely very spooky.

00:37:05.738 --> 00:37:10.982
But we hope that you'll be able to join us for a Halloween night of howling and howling!

00:37:11.022 --> 00:37:12.123
A bit earlier than Halloween.

00:37:12.203 --> 00:37:13.163
A bit earlier.

00:37:13.223 --> 00:37:13.724
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:17.131
I'm looking forward to it!

00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:21.019
FUWAMOCO Week 1!

00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:23.920
We hope you'll be there!

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.601
Please, please!

Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 32nd episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:37:34.764 --> 00:37:36.305

00:37:50.834 --> 00:37:53.536
Ruffians, you're too quick!

00:37:53.796 --> 00:37:54.436
You're too fast!
