05:29.310 --> 05:32.860
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.830
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:36.140 --> 05:40.875

Ruffians!

05:47.360 --> 05:50.864
Thank you for joining us today for our 64th episode!

05:50.964 --> 05:51.545
Like an N64?

05:51.625 --> 05:54.248
Today's the FWMC64?

06:00.259 --> 06:01.800
Is that what you're thinking about or hi?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.761
That's what I'm thinking about!

06:04.422 --> 06:06.083
BAU BAU!

06:06.383 --> 06:06.543
FWMC64.

06:06.623 --> 06:14.548
Well, unfortunately we don't have any game news because this is FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:15.108 --> 06:19.331
And in case you're joining us for the very first time today,

06:20.191 --> 06:26.293
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.114

06:28.534 --> 06:31.735

Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:38.237 --> 06:42.679

06:42.699 --> 06:46.860
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:47.281 --> 06:48.021
BAU BAU!

06:51.543 --> 06:52.483
On the right paw.

06:52.523 --> 06:53.904
On the right paw.

06:54.304 --> 07:00.648
And what gets us on the right paw other than a pero sighting?

07:02.690 --> 07:03.230
Okay.

07:04.551 --> 07:05.811
Okay, ruffians.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.893
Well, what do you have for today?

07:09.714 --> 07:10.334
Let's see.

07:11.435 --> 07:12.135
De-den!

07:12.295 --> 07:12.335
Uh...

07:18.117 --> 07:34.366
Well, like, you know, it's, I guess it's the beginning of a new year and with the new year, you know, it's good to take a look at the scenery and nothing beats looking out and gazing at the majestic Mount Fuji.

07:34.846 --> 07:41.410
Except for, you know, when a very big peril blocks your view.

07:42.850 --> 07:43.711
What happened to him?

07:45.168 --> 07:45.528
Hi.

07:46.169 --> 07:51.115
Yeah, uh, maybe he had a very happy Christmas or New Year's.

07:51.396 --> 07:54.640
Oh, so like, maybe he ate a bunch of family's osechi?

07:54.840 --> 07:58.024
Oh, I thought you were gonna say maybe he ate a whole bunch of family's.

07:58.905 --> 08:01.688
Or, what if he ate a whole bunch of family's?

08:04.517 --> 08:07.238
Maybe he just had too much mochi, so that, you know, he became the mochi himself.

08:07.258 --> 08:08.678
Actually, I wouldn't mind becoming mochi, too.

08:08.718 --> 08:10.059
You know.

08:10.159 --> 08:11.059
But we already, you know.

08:11.799 --> 08:11.979

08:28.123 --> 08:28.804
What we?

08:28.844 --> 08:29.044
What we?

08:29.064 --> 08:29.284
What we?

08:29.304 --> 08:29.564

08:29.584 --> 08:29.824

08:32.525 --> 08:32.865
What we?

08:32.905 --> 08:33.065
What we?

08:33.085 --> 08:33.325
What we?

08:34.708 --> 08:36.450
I'm Fuwawa, your mochichi.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.433
Mocomochi.

08:40.913 --> 08:46.478
I wonder what would happen if we gave Pero a little bit of a push.

08:46.498 --> 08:53.023
I wonder what kind of scream he'd make, you know.

08:53.043 --> 08:55.465
Right, ruffians?

08:56.186 --> 08:59.128
Could be kind of a delicious scream.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.276
Mochi delicious!

09:18.444 --> 09:20.065
BAU BAU!

09:20.385 --> 09:27.770
Something that's even a better sign than last year!

09:27.790 --> 09:29.731
Ruffians!

09:29.831 --> 09:31.632
Ruffians!

09:32.453 --> 09:40.157
We told you last FUWAMOCO Morning to not forget about our new year outfit reveals, right?

09:41.538 --> 09:44.500
And, well, that's because...

09:45.928 --> 09:47.411
They're happening today!

09:47.452 --> 09:49.356
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

09:49.476 --> 09:51.200
You didn't forget, right?

09:51.560 --> 09:55.730
Today is Alvin's first new outfit!

09:57.704 --> 09:58.885
We're very excited.

09:58.985 --> 10:00.446
In case you didn't know, we know.

10:00.466 --> 10:00.946
But today!

10:01.006 --> 10:04.889
We finally get to share them with you today!

10:04.969 --> 10:05.890
Today!

10:06.070 --> 10:06.550
Yeah!

10:07.210 --> 10:13.615
We'll be doing a really starting at 5pm PT over on Shiori's channel.

10:13.735 --> 10:16.436
Shiori's the first to share with you.

10:16.797 --> 10:24.582
And then we're gonna be ending off everything with a collab that you won't want to miss right here on our channel.

10:25.663 --> 10:27.525
I'm not certain but I have a feeling.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.961
There might be some surprises to us!

10:37.101 --> 10:37.581
Right!

10:37.801 --> 10:38.562
So you know!

10:39.162 --> 10:41.804
You wanna be there!

10:41.864 --> 10:42.104
Yeah!

10:42.224 --> 10:57.634
And you know, ruffians, it means a lot to us too, because as silly as it sounds, we really never thought we'd get special outfits like these, so we want you to be there to celebrate it with us and all of Advent!

10:58.255 --> 10:59.356
Okay!

10:59.456 --> 11:03.218
We know it's a bit exciting, but we hope you won't miss it, okay?

11:04.979 --> 11:09.600
Make sure to take deep breaths beforehand, okay?

11:09.620 --> 11:11.681
Deep breaths, okay?

11:11.701 --> 11:19.463
Are you gonna sneeze?

11:19.503 --> 11:22.943
Like that, okay?

11:23.003 --> 11:23.504
Like that.

11:23.564 --> 11:26.344
That was a deep breath.

11:26.404 --> 11:26.864
BAU BAU!

11:32.180 --> 11:34.121
That's a very deep breath, right?

11:36.182 --> 11:37.422
Well, ruffians!

11:37.782 --> 11:47.405
You know, not just Advent's New Year outfit relay, but there's also some even more exciting things coming up for FUWAMOCO English!

11:48.246 --> 11:56.928
Wow, you might have heard, but Rei-senpai just announced a big project that's featuring all of us!

11:57.229 --> 11:58.429
She's been working on it

12:00.026 --> 12:01.428
It's a song cover of Minecraft!

12:01.468 --> 12:10.599
Back in the summer, you know, Bibi-senpai happened to win 1 million yen the whole summer bingo.

12:19.392 --> 12:19.933
FUWAMOCO Morning!

12:38.928 --> 12:41.909
That just makes things more exciting!

12:42.410 --> 12:45.151
Yeah, and look at the main visual there for this!

12:45.891 --> 12:47.872
It's so beautiful and colorful!

12:48.233 --> 12:50.874
And the alternate outfit designs too!

12:51.874 --> 12:52.975
Ruffians.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.996
What do you think of FUWAMOCO?

12:56.436 --> 12:57.277
Ah, cute.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.398
We're a little bit far apart from each other, right?

13:00.458 --> 13:01.019
That's fine.

13:01.399 --> 13:02.099
That's fine.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.700
We live on both sides, you know?

13:03.720 --> 13:04.400
Yeah, you know.

13:04.420 --> 13:09.303
Sandwiching in two pieces of bread, you have your Fuwawa slice and your Mococo slice.

13:09.363 --> 13:09.743
Right?

13:09.843 --> 13:10.624
Just like bread.

13:10.904 --> 13:11.524
And you know what?

13:11.644 --> 13:14.706
Actually, I don't mind because look at Nerissa.

13:15.246 --> 13:15.706
Why?

13:15.746 --> 13:23.070
She's especially cute there with the outfit and the skirt and all the pantyhose.

13:24.501 --> 13:27.362
Just a little longer maybe?

13:44.127 --> 13:45.568
BAU BAU!

13:45.588 --> 13:50.173
And again, once more, thank you very much!

13:51.194 --> 13:52.415
I'm so excited.

13:52.855 --> 13:58.021
Ruffians, we haven't had some sneak peeks, sneak listens.

13:59.582 --> 14:00.023
Exciting.

14:00.063 --> 14:01.004
BAU BAU!

14:05.114 --> 14:09.599
Fubuki-senpai has something pretty cool going on right now.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.681
She just released

14:23.183 --> 14:23.944
BAU BAU!

14:39.887 --> 14:51.296
You know, to celebrate the ASMR set coming out, the two of them did a super fun 3D stream where they tried out a whole bunch of silly voice lines with an ASMR mic.

14:51.536 --> 14:52.657
It was pretty crazy, huh?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.158
Fubuki-mama!

14:54.919 --> 14:56.480
Fubuki-mama!

14:56.540 --> 14:59.562
There's so many ears all over the place too.

14:59.582 --> 15:00.623
Lots of ears.

15:01.403 --> 15:05.647
Yeah, well, before they performed an intense final song together,

15:06.207 --> 15:13.332
Pacho read some of the rave reviews from Fubuki-senpai from her ASMR set that she received.

15:14.313 --> 15:21.337
And you know, there was one reviewer named Fluff and Fuzz-san.

15:24.379 --> 15:26.281
I wonder who that could have been, hoi.

15:26.581 --> 15:30.003
It's confusing, hoi.

15:31.693 --> 15:39.279
Well, it was a really fun stream and we want to say a big congratulations to both Bubuki-senpai and Patrasche too!

15:39.560 --> 15:40.080
Omedetou!

15:40.140 --> 15:43.523
BAU BAU!

15:43.743 --> 15:54.852
And FUWAMOCO, we don't really know that much about ASMR yet, but we hope that maybe this year we can try to learn as much as we can about ASMR too!

15:54.892 --> 15:55.593
BAU BAU!

16:05.906 --> 16:10.148
BAU BAU!

16:10.548 --> 16:15.971
Well, also ruffians, you know it's been almost six months now.

16:17.532 --> 16:27.238
Probably by this time, you kind of realize, you kind of recognize what FUWAMOCO's sleeping habits are.

16:29.259 --> 16:30.820
And I'll be like, the best.

16:31.200 --> 16:31.860
Well,

16:34.062 --> 16:34.743
I know it!

16:35.685 --> 16:38.268
Sometimes, you know, just can't help it.

16:38.929 --> 16:41.473
You know, night or day, we're working on things!

16:41.533 --> 16:43.116
We're going!

16:43.176 --> 16:44.858
But, sometimes...

16:46.038 --> 16:51.542
You know, being up at times when our senpai are streaming is a pretty great time.

16:51.642 --> 17:02.509
You know, because yesterday we were able to fall into Subaru-senpai's special call-in stream.

17:02.549 --> 17:08.352
You know, finally we had our first proper one-on-one conversation with her.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.034
It was a lot of fun!

17:11.474 --> 17:13.876
You know, I got to call her Subaru-senpai.

17:14.376 --> 17:15.297
And with BAU BAU,

17:15.917 --> 17:17.999
Shuba-shuba together too!

17:18.019 --> 17:18.740

Shuba-shuba!

17:30.551 --> 17:31.351
Shuba-shuba!

17:31.531 --> 17:32.032
Shuba-shuba!

17:32.072 --> 17:32.552

17:33.353 --> 17:33.914
Shuba-shuba!

17:33.934 --> 17:34.214
Shuba-shuba!

17:34.254 --> 17:34.554
Shuba-shuba!

17:34.574 --> 17:34.895
Shuba-shuba!

17:34.915 --> 17:35.455
Shuba-shuba!

17:35.495 --> 17:35.835
Shuba-shuba!

17:35.855 --> 17:36.376
Shuba-shuba!

17:36.416 --> 17:37.076
Shuba-shuba!

17:37.657 --> 17:41.518
She's so cool and funny and charismatic, too.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.798
I know.

17:42.878 --> 17:45.479
Saikou deshita!

17:46.259 --> 17:47.960
Aikatta ne!

17:48.020 --> 17:53.401
We really hope that we can grow to become a strong, independent group.

17:53.541 --> 17:59.443
Let's hear some days, maybe, collab together sometime soon, too.

18:00.143 --> 18:01.503
Overclocked ruffians!

18:01.523 --> 18:02.544
BAU BAU!

18:05.111 --> 18:09.915
Ruffians, have you been a little bit busier than normal?

18:24.147 --> 18:32.434
Well, one of the fun things going on was Koyori-senpai's 24 hour stream KONKOYO24!

18:32.794 --> 18:39.560
And, well, we kind of introduced it here, but Advent was invited to play some games with Koyori-senpai too!

18:39.600 --> 18:44.664
Yeah, you know, we were really confident after watching Bijou and Nerissa take it down.

18:44.704 --> 18:45.225
Nerissa.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.487
Nerissa!

18:48.568 --> 18:49.328
Go down!

18:52.091 --> 18:52.992
Nerissa!

18:53.352 --> 18:56.996
Now I'm distracted, huh?

18:57.016 --> 18:58.597
Nerissa!

18:58.637 --> 19:01.180
Wait to become FUWAMOCO.

19:02.861 --> 19:06.625
I think it was because I said Bijou and then I was confused.

19:09.386 --> 19:12.348
I'm just a Bijou.

19:12.468 --> 19:13.849
I had to balance it out, you know.

19:14.289 --> 19:15.850
Bijou and Nerissa.

19:15.870 --> 19:23.675
But, you know, after watching them, you know, we were a bit confident.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.257
We thought we'd do well, too.

19:25.977 --> 19:26.417
I know.

19:27.138 --> 19:29.099
We even started out with air hockey.

19:29.139 --> 19:33.222
Yeah, we're pretty confident with air hockey, or at least I was.

19:35.503 --> 19:36.224
What happened, Hai?

19:40.168 --> 19:48.082
And you know, Fuwawa was screaming like she was being... What am I doing?

19:48.202 --> 19:50.105
Maybe it worked well because I...

19:51.345 --> 19:58.687
It was 5am in Japan, so everyone was able to wake up well, huh?

19:58.787 --> 20:08.590
It was a bunch of fun, but unsurprisingly, in the end, we completely lost to Coyote-senpai.

20:08.650 --> 20:11.230
The only thing we did win out was boxing.

20:12.071 --> 20:17.272
But, you know, that was the last game we played, and I feel like she was kinda going

20:18.013 --> 20:18.414
We won!

20:18.774 --> 20:21.699
We won fair and square.

20:21.719 --> 20:22.981
And you know what?

20:23.382 --> 20:24.383
We had lots of fun.

20:27.219 --> 20:29.500
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo Abyssgard!

20:29.520 --> 20:33.463
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo Abyssgard!

20:52.754 --> 20:57.137
One of our goals this year is to collab more, so... It's kind of happening.

20:57.617 --> 20:58.117
Happening.

20:58.297 --> 20:58.817
Happening.

20:59.198 --> 21:00.038
Baby steps.

21:00.138 --> 21:00.959
Baby steps.

21:00.999 --> 21:01.599
Baby steps.

21:01.619 --> 21:03.580
One little step at a time.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.181
Let's do it today.

21:05.721 --> 21:06.061
Today.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.082
Together.

21:07.102 --> 21:08.543
Today!

21:09.343 --> 21:11.304
BAU BAU!

21:11.344 --> 21:15.807
BAU BAU!

21:15.887 --> 21:16.987
So many happy things.

21:17.007 --> 21:19.769
Exciting things going on, Ruffians!

21:20.723 --> 21:22.463
It's not hard to have a smile.

21:24.604 --> 21:35.027
But, well, uh... Actually, ruffians... There's been another misunderstanding.

21:35.567 --> 21:46.650
Or, or, uh... Actually, uh, sorry, no... We haven't had any misunderstanding, alright?

21:47.719 --> 21:55.228
In fact, it seems like for the last few FUWAMOCO Mornings, misunderstandings have been missing.

21:56.049 --> 21:56.289
Huh?

21:57.411 --> 21:57.611
Huh?

21:58.372 --> 21:59.793
What do you mean missing?

22:00.634 --> 22:01.836
Misunderstandings.

22:02.637 --> 22:03.378
Missing!

22:03.598 --> 22:04.219
Missing.

22:04.239 --> 22:04.399
I know.

22:05.635 --> 22:23.293
Ruffians, they love our misunderstandings, so... Well, you know, maybe it's just that now we've been a part of hololive for a while, you know, people are generally coming to the understanding that, well, that's just FUWAMOCO, you know, nothing weird here, right?

22:23.914 --> 22:24.254
Right?

22:24.434 --> 22:28.438
So you know, what if I say school days is good, right?

22:29.259 --> 22:31.460
That's, that's Fuwawa, right!

22:31.960 --> 22:35.901
You know, what if, what if we call Fubuki, FUBUKI-MAMA!

22:36.341 --> 22:36.761
Right.

22:37.301 --> 22:39.062
Fubuki-senpai would be like, okay.

22:39.682 --> 22:40.082
Right.

22:40.722 --> 22:45.543
You know, so what if we do something kinda silly on Twitter, right?

22:45.884 --> 22:47.504
Right, that happens all the time!

22:47.544 --> 22:48.404
That was not me.

22:48.444 --> 22:50.945
Yeah, that's just FUWAMOCO being FUWAMOCO, right?

22:51.065 --> 22:52.145
Right, ruffians?

22:53.306 --> 22:53.586
Huh?

22:54.366 --> 22:54.566
Huh?

22:55.914 --> 22:58.895
I don't know if I'm happy about this situation, ruffians.

23:03.596 --> 23:04.596
Don't think just how!

23:04.716 --> 23:05.936
Don't think just how!

23:07.236 --> 23:09.157
Nothing's really happening, okay?

23:11.097 --> 23:20.079
I'm sure, you know, there will probably be more misunderstandings in the future, so... Either wait for them, or not, ruffians.

23:22.153 --> 23:27.617
Make what you were all about, okay?

23:27.637 --> 23:28.077
BAU BAU!

23:28.137 --> 23:31.019
BAU BAU.

23:32.159 --> 23:34.701
Well, you know, New Year 2024.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.142
FUWAMOCO.

23:36.642 --> 23:40.224
It's almost gonna be our half anniversary too.

23:40.284 --> 23:41.585
Girl, you know it!

23:42.006 --> 23:45.088
So maybe we're growing just a bit more fans!

23:46.038 --> 23:46.438
Maybe.

23:46.718 --> 23:47.098
Maybe!

23:47.258 --> 23:47.799
Maybe not.

23:50.599 --> 23:55.121
Let's check out who is the Doggie of the Day today!

23:55.221 --> 23:57.682
We have for the Doggie of the Day!

23:57.762 --> 24:00.563
Our Doggie of the Day today is... Dad!

24:02.183 --> 24:03.304
Mewmaw!

24:03.584 --> 24:04.544
BAU BAU!

24:05.644 --> 24:07.025
That's a lot of fight, Kai.

24:07.085 --> 24:07.405
Right?

24:07.505 --> 24:09.046
So much fight.

24:09.746 --> 24:11.047
Some beautiful locks.

24:11.067 --> 24:13.048
Yeah.

24:13.348 --> 24:14.868
He's a borky boy.

24:14.908 --> 24:16.229
Borky.

24:16.309 --> 24:17.089
Borky boy.

24:17.209 --> 24:18.350
Nine years old.

24:18.730 --> 24:20.931
Masa up so pupu.

24:20.951 --> 24:21.631
Right.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.992
Even though Naima looks rather tiny.

24:24.152 --> 24:24.532
Right.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.073
I don't think I want to mess with him, right?

24:27.394 --> 24:31.155
There's a bit of attitude behind all the hair there, Kai.

24:31.455 --> 24:31.655
Yeah.

24:33.823 --> 24:36.565
How do we think BAU BAU?

24:37.005 --> 24:38.346
Well, if it's borky, then... BAU!

24:38.366 --> 24:38.426

24:38.446 --> 24:38.666

24:56.645 --> 24:57.565
FUWAMOCO Morning!

25:19.852 --> 25:26.911
Yeah, and even though he might look a little intimidating at first, deep down, he's a sweetie.

25:27.552 --> 25:28.094
Like me.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.833
BAU BAU!

25:35.133 --> 25:35.914
Let's take a look.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.814
Ruffians, you've been out on a boat.

25:37.894 --> 25:39.615
Where are you going for walks, huh?

25:40.115 --> 25:44.597
Well, we have de-den!

25:45.917 --> 25:49.119
This is too cool!

25:50.379 --> 25:50.999
BAU BAU!

26:20.967 --> 26:24.009
And next, we have our question of the day.

26:24.029 --> 26:26.771
For our question of the day, we have De-den!

26:26.911 --> 26:28.252
BAU BAU!

26:28.352 --> 26:29.933
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

26:30.013 --> 26:30.714
Hello!

26:30.774 --> 26:33.095
Congrats on another cover.

26:33.556 --> 26:34.476
White love collision.

26:35.877 --> 26:37.358
I love all the songs you released.

26:37.418 --> 26:38.119
Thank you!

26:38.179 --> 26:42.182
Has FUWAMOCO thought about an official song collab with their senpai?

26:42.482 --> 26:44.443
City pop with Marine or Gura?

26:44.783 --> 26:46.504
Rock with Suisei or Towa?

26:46.885 --> 26:48.586
No matter what, I'll loop them!

26:48.766 --> 26:49.647
You bet it!

26:51.187 --> 26:52.188
Is that a threat?

26:52.208 --> 26:53.489
It's not a threat.

26:53.609 --> 26:56.451
That just, you know, that sounds too cool, right?

26:56.831 --> 27:01.293
Well, we'd absolutely love to sing anything with our senpai!

27:01.353 --> 27:02.114
Of course!

27:02.134 --> 27:07.597
And I know that's a big reason why we're so excited about Minecraft too, because what can't we do?

27:07.637 --> 27:11.798
I get to be singing with my senpai for the first time!

27:11.978 --> 27:18.641
And as you might know, Ruffians, one of our goals is to sing some J-pop lullies with Marine-senchou-senpai!

27:18.961 --> 27:22.942
So I definitely want to do that if she wanted to, you know?

27:23.222 --> 27:24.322
Agura-senpai too!

27:24.362 --> 27:25.163
Of course!

27:25.343 --> 27:31.565
You know, and I don't know if we're skilled enough yet to sing with Suisei-senpai or Towa-senpai yet.

27:32.205 --> 27:35.867
But, if we're invited, we absolutely do our best!

27:37.567 --> 27:39.888
We still have a bit of improving to do.

27:40.028 --> 27:41.069
A lot of improving.

27:41.089 --> 27:45.971
You know, before we make some of our song collab dreams come true.

27:46.151 --> 27:47.672
But, we'll work on it, okay?

27:47.712 --> 27:49.932
Yeah, you know, we're still just newbies.

27:50.033 --> 27:53.514
So, we want to grow ourselves first, you know?

27:54.294 --> 28:00.337
But, if someone offers... We'll do our best!

28:01.135 --> 28:02.716
BAU BAU!

28:03.256 --> 28:06.778
Thank you so much everyone for all your submissions!

28:07.198 --> 28:14.061
We're always keeping an eye out, so please, please use the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

28:14.101 --> 28:15.882
No hashtag, hashtag.

28:16.542 --> 28:20.624
And submit your pero sightings, your walks, your doggy of the days.

28:21.044 --> 28:25.206
And also, I know you're pretty good journalist, ruffians.

28:26.126 --> 28:28.827
FWMC scoop, don't forget, okay?

28:28.847 --> 28:29.868
It's waiting for you.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.200
BAU BAU!

28:32.280 --> 28:34.221
Thank you, all my Ruffians!

28:34.901 --> 28:40.604
Well, for our next stream, we have, in case you didn't know... You didn't forget, right, Ruffians?

28:41.024 --> 28:41.584
We have!

28:41.624 --> 28:42.524
Wait, wait, Moco-chan.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.545
Ruffians, can you announce what the next stream is for us?

28:45.806 --> 28:46.906
Oh, please, go ahead.

28:47.166 --> 28:47.366
Oh!

28:48.106 --> 28:49.387
I wanna hear what you think it is.

28:53.270 --> 28:59.317
We have our New Year Advent Review!

28:59.357 --> 29:01.099
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

29:01.199 --> 29:03.201
I'm proud of you, Ruffians.

29:03.421 --> 29:04.623
It's really okay.

29:05.203 --> 29:09.007
So the first one starts at 5pm PT over on Shiori's channel.

29:09.968 --> 29:11.370
Make sure you do, okay?

29:11.730 --> 29:12.792
5pm PT.

29:14.173 --> 29:17.536
That's 10AM JST.

29:18.036 --> 29:18.657
Okay!

29:19.457 --> 29:21.299
BAU BAU!

29:21.319 --> 29:24.101
Time for our schedule!

29:24.481 --> 29:25.422
Let's take a little look.

29:25.502 --> 29:25.902
Wow!

29:26.002 --> 29:28.344
It's kind of different because things changed.

29:28.724 --> 29:31.867
Today is not Mario Kart 8 Deluxe practice.

29:31.907 --> 29:33.788
That's gonna be tomorrow.

29:34.028 --> 29:41.494
Tomorrow at 6PM PT, our usual stream time, we will be practicing some Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

29:42.095 --> 29:43.456
And then, after that,

29:44.096 --> 29:47.219
Well, we have the holo cup qualifiers.

29:48.440 --> 29:57.967
And then, the next day, we will be having our cozy, cute HF with the doggy pack at our usual time, so we hope that you'll be there, okay?

29:58.508 --> 30:00.790
The waiting rooms are all there, okay?

30:00.830 --> 30:08.656
But we'll make sure to update YouTube and also Twitter with the changes, too, so... Thank you, Ruffians, for understanding!

30:08.756 --> 30:09.056
BAU BAU!

30:11.893 --> 30:17.438
Oh wow, before we know it, we're at the end of the first week of 2024.

30:17.838 --> 30:18.499
Crazy.

30:19.599 --> 30:24.003
Thank you so much, ruffians, for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

30:24.043 --> 30:24.623
