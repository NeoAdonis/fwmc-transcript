## Introduction (05:00)

## Pero Sighting (06:51)

[DLan](https://twitter.com/DylanMend/status/1698633380928102867) found some Pero tokens in what seems a 'shady' arcade.

## holoEN "Promise" (09:07)

During the last [IRyS + Council 3D Collab](https://youtu.be/sEnjWtbnUj4), it was announced that IRyS would join Fauna, Kronii, Mumei and Baelz to form the new hololive English unit "Promise"!

## 200K Views for "Lifetime Showtime" (10:38)

Daily reminder to stream FUWAMOCO's original song ["Lifetime Showtime"](https://youtu.be/-wzgy7uTuSk), which official video has recently reached 200K views on YouTube.

## Mumei Music (12:29)

FUWAMOCO's fellow member [Nanashi Mumei](https://www.youtube.com/@NanashiMumei) is having a [karaoke stream](https://youtu.be/bDjzpMmw-JY) and releasing ["mumei"](https://youtu.be/oA0CpI0vCK4), her new original song, afterwards.

## Misunderstanding (14:26)

Fuwawa swears that, during [last Rock 'n Rawr party](https://youtu.be/9e8Wnx-FRQk?t=3238), she didn't ask Ruffians if they would want some of her 'puppies', but rather 'copies' of her "Bararaika" albums. Oddly enough, Mococo thought that Fuwawa actually said the former because it was [*somehow*](https://youtu.be/QEOdcdct0wM?t=1m03s) related to that song…

## Apology (18:06)

Mococo apologizes profusely with her fellow holoID zombie idol [Kureiji Ollie](https://youtube.com/@KureijiOllie) after leaving her last message on read. Apparently, she had the message composed but forgot to hit 'send' and noticed only after a week.

## Natto Challenge (22:26)

Mondays are for ~~suffering~~ conquering new challenges, and Mococo takes again on eating natto. After a brief moment of bargaining, stalling and a [Fuwawa sneeze](https://youtu.be/4ljeCZkA2mc?t=1656), [Mococo painstakingly chows two beans](https://youtu.be/4ljeCZkA2mc?t=1867).

## Doggie of the Day (32:53)

From [NarwhalsCantSimp](https://twitter.com/NarwhalsCant/status/1710779669325193405), today we have the lovely half-siblings Sampson and Sassafras. It reminded FUWAMOCO of a different pair of twin sister puppies…

## Today I Went On a walk (35:20)

Despite the weather getting colder, [OraNav](https://twitter.com/Nepgyaaaaaaa/status/1710216435807498516) took a walk along a nature trail and found an old water mill and a waterfall.

## Question of the day (36:50)

[Claire](https://twitter.com/ExistingClaire/status/1710657549304053829) wonders if FUWAMOCO have ever been anxious about a test. It seems that they've been there, and specifically recall having trouble with a certain class they had during guard dog training and almost gave up, but in the end, they persevered and passed it!

## Next Stream & Schedule (40:00)

## Thanks & Extra Special Ruffians (42:05)
