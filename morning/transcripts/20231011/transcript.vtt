00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.842
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:11.824
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:16.086
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:18.508
BAU BAU!

00:05:19.148 --> 00:05:21.869
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.031
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:27.973
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:28.013 --> 00:05:28.473
BAU BAU!

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:35.033
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:35.193 --> 00:05:38.837
Thank you for waking up right early for us.

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:39.958
Are you awake?

00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.259
I'm awake.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.121
For our 31st episode!

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:47.605
BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.547
Ruffians, you're awake, right?

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:50.828
Okiteru?

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:52.510
Is your brain moving?

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:58.045
If you shake your head around enough, your brain will... It will start moving, okay?

00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.966
Just shake your head a bit!

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:13.152
Well, for the Ruffians that are maybe joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:13.833
A.K.A.

00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:14.813
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:18.215
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:20.056
I think it was good, huh?

00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:27.759
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.362
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:33.522 --> 00:06:39.265
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.026
BAU BAU!

00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:47.289
Well, to start our morning off, we have... Oh, you're pretty confident about this one, Moco-chan.

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.229
Another... Pero Sighting.

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.343
Where is Pero now this time?

00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:57.845
She's pretty free spirited, I think, nowadays.

00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.566
Where is he?

00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:02.808
De-den!

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.813
It looks like a Ruffian was out in the yard the other day doing some work and mowing the lawn, but...

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:19.806
They might have spotted Pero, but because what they found kind of looks like his broken bones.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:30.288
Happy Halloween!

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:30.848
Spooky.

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:31.849
Spooky.

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:36.032
That's a funny joke to get us into the Halloween spirit, right?

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:36.612
Right?

00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:37.173
Spooky.

00:07:37.193 --> 00:07:37.593
Spooky.

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:40.175
Pero's weird, isn't he?

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:41.976
Unfortunately, yeah.

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:43.917
We're sure he's around somewhere.

00:07:44.057 --> 00:07:48.120
We just have to keep our eyes open for him.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.440
Yeah.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:56.225
No matter how much we punch and kick and stomp and throw him around, you know, he never seems to really take that much damage.

00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:56.626
No.

00:07:57.847 --> 00:08:07.383
You know, in the first place, are you really sure that this is Pero and not a bunny?

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:11.390
That would be sad, but...

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:19.594
You know, it's kind of blurry, but... But bunnies don't usually have purple on them, so it's okay.

00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:23.236
I'm sure it's just like a spooky Halloween joke, you know?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:27.598
Thanks for the season's greetings, Ruffians!

00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:33.161
Please let us know if you think maybe you'll see Pero around again sometime soon.

00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:36.002
It's okay if maybe it was just a bunny in the end.

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:37.263
It's okay, Chiyo.

00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:38.904
BAU BAU!

00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:40.345
BAU BAU!

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:45.047
Must have been a bit of a bump, right?

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:46.327
A little bit of a bump.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:48.408
He's a bit big, so maybe a big bump.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:50.528
Unless it was a bunny.

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:52.269
BAU BAU!

00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:55.569
FUWAMOCO-chan, what kind of good news do we have today?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.131
We have... a confession.

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:03.211
Yeah.

00:09:04.572 --> 00:09:04.812
Yeah.

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.192
Well, Ruffians!

00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:08.053
Did you get much rest?

00:09:09.912 --> 00:09:10.332
Did you?

00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:12.053
Hopefully you did!

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:14.854
And hopefully it was a very good one!

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:26.539
Because, uh, yesterday... Yesterday, something unexpected happened that we have to confess about.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.781
Yesterday, we were playing Adventures of Cookie and Cream, right?

00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:32.262
Right!

00:09:33.763 --> 00:09:37.725
And it was our final stream, right?

00:09:38.006 --> 00:09:40.647
We just planned to finish off the last little bit of it.

00:09:40.707 --> 00:09:41.928
Yeah, just the last little bit.

00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:44.089
Yeah, because last time we got really far.

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.451
We tried to complete it, but didn't quite finish it.

00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:50.453
So it shouldn't have been that bad, right?

00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:55.516
You know, we expected to play maybe two hours or so.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:55.996
Yeah.

00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:58.858
But how long did we play?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.501
Not two hours.

00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:02.482
No.

00:10:03.023 --> 00:10:03.884
Not three hours.

00:10:04.224 --> 00:10:04.785
No.

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:05.485
Not four.

00:10:05.506 --> 00:10:05.746
Uh-uh.

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:07.328
Not five.

00:10:07.488 --> 00:10:08.349
Not even five?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.353
Yesterday, we streamed for six and a half hours.

00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:13.495
Yeah.

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:15.116
And it wasn't that simple.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:21.356
You know, you know, Ruffians, we had a duel with the crazy small hippos.

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:24.999
We had the moon boss that had no attack pattern.

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:29.262
But then, after we actually finished the game.

00:10:29.322 --> 00:10:31.384
We had already beat the game, you know it.

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:36.447
We realized that we had unlocked something very fearsome.

00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:39.190
An extra bonus world.

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:43.878
You know, we all thought, why not?

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:45.801
We have to clear the morning's world.

00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:46.482
Right?

00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:47.403
It won't be bad.

00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:49.185
That was a mistake.

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:49.605
Yep.

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.690
Because it had the puzzle level.

00:10:54.672 --> 00:10:56.514
That awful, awful puzzle level.

00:10:58.376 --> 00:10:59.397
And it took us forever.

00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:08.169
You know, we really thought about stopping there and calling it quits because, you know, we already beat the game.

00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:10.411
It was just the extra bonus level.

00:11:11.152 --> 00:11:12.453
We hadn't had any dinner.

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:13.033
No.

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:14.915
Or lunch.

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.019
My tummy.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.984
Yeah, Moco-chan's tummy was making a lot of sounds, Ruffians.

00:11:25.004 --> 00:11:26.125
I know.

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:30.367
We needed to get to sleep too, you know it.

00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:33.768
But instead, we continued!

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:36.510
And you saw, right Ruffians?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.652
You know, we tried getting hints and working all together on it on Twitter.

00:11:43.313 --> 00:11:47.414
But even then, it was tough.

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.115
So you know it.

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:51.196
Then we called in all of Advent.

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:53.457
And we worked on it all together!

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:55.658
And, guess what?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.990
Guess what?

00:12:00.112 --> 00:12:04.835
At the last second, we completed it!

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:05.235
We did it!

00:12:05.275 --> 00:12:12.499
And thanks to you, we were able to clear all the stages of the bonus world and completely 100% clear the game!

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.481
Yeah!

00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.863
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:12:18.183 --> 00:12:19.504
You're proud of us, right?

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:21.105
Right.

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:32.866
Because of all of this, we knew that there was also a sacrifice involved too.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:42.050
We knew the trade-off to persisting and trying to clear the game also meant that FUWAMOCO would definitely not get sleep.

00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:49.334
You know, homework still needs to be done, so sleep eluded us for a little bit longer.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:59.644
I didn't want to give up, you know, but we also weren't expecting to be fighting for so long against the bonus world.

00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:04.166
You weren't expecting that either, right?

00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:06.407
We're in it together, you know.

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:12.270
I think for FUWAMOCO, for us, we aren't really like some of our senpai.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.711
Regular sleep is very important for us to function properly.

00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.713
And for the last few weeks,

00:13:20.143 --> 00:13:22.605
We've been kind of lucky to get four hours or so.

00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:27.087
So, I'm starting to feel it maybe a bit.

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:27.908
Just a bit.

00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:29.909
Sometimes.

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:35.412
So, for today, Ruffians, please give us lots of strength, okay?

00:13:35.993 --> 00:13:36.493
Okay.

00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:38.094
Ruffians!

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.315
Power, please!

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:41.936
Power!

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.998
BAU BAU!

00:13:45.018 --> 00:13:46.139
You give us power, right?

00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.497
But it was worth it.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.318
It was really fun.

00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:52.358
Just unexpected fun.

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:58.639
Well, surely you know, it's a new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:00.620
There'll be some good news, alright?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.040
Especially last time, there's so much good news!

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.421
Well this time, we have this!

00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.582
Bad news.

00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:14.423
Bad news.

00:14:14.483 --> 00:14:15.163
Bad news.

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:31.641
Our bad news is that the other day we were recording and no matter what, Fuwawa just couldn't stop biting her tongue.

00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:36.423
We had three different recordings of her saying, maybe we should have

00:14:37.554 --> 00:14:39.675
With an audible bite down on her tongue.

00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:41.235
It really hurt, Ruffians!

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:49.398
Every single time she tried to retake it, it was like... I just couldn't stop crying.

00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:53.459
It's the first time that something like that happened to me, Ruffians!

00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:56.120
It was so frustrating!

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.120
It was frustrating for me too!

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.041
Take it again!

00:15:01.061 --> 00:15:03.922
Do you ever have times like that, Ruffians?

00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:15.634
I hope that I can get less tongue-tied like our senpai, you know, with years of experience and hopefully just have the words roll out of me with eloquence one day.

00:15:15.654 --> 00:15:17.896
Ah, eloquence and grace and style.

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:26.346
Hopefully then the Ruffians will think, when they think eloquence and grace and style, they think of FUWAMOCO.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:30.161
Or maybe not for now.

00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:31.282
Did it taste good?

00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:33.544
Does your own tongue taste good?

00:15:34.304 --> 00:15:35.866
No, it's not like yutan.

00:15:36.306 --> 00:15:36.606
No.

00:15:38.528 --> 00:15:40.029
How does your tongue feel now though?

00:15:40.229 --> 00:15:40.909
It hurts.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.711
Is it still damaged?

00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:51.337
If I drink water, the tip of my tongue is like... Let's make sure our tongue doesn't go...

00:15:53.484 --> 00:15:53.964
Okay.

00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:56.125
Let's do better, okay?

00:15:56.145 --> 00:15:59.705
BAU BAU.

00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:02.906
Tongue is troublesome sometimes.

00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:08.607
You know what they say.

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:11.768
That bad news comes in threes.

00:16:14.968 --> 00:16:16.989
Ruffians.

00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:21.150
At the very least, today comes in twos.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.250
You see, today...

00:16:23.402 --> 00:16:26.785
Another lightbulb has burnt out in the FUWAMOCO den.

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:36.235
And this time, it's a rather crucial light that lets us see what we eat and brightens our workspace.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:40.879
So now we live in darkness with only three lights brightening up our space.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.564
Maybe it's finally time for us to try and change them back.

00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:56.675
Ruffians, can you help us change them without falling off the ladder or getting electrocuted or dropping the lightbulb and having it go everywhere?

00:16:57.595 --> 00:17:03.618
You know, it's now the time of the year where it's much more dark out too, so it's a bit of a downer, you know?

00:17:04.338 --> 00:17:07.039
I hope that somehow they get fixed soon.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.060
Yeah, somehow.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.742
I don't like ghosts, but if they fix the lightbulb then maybe.

00:17:12.762 --> 00:17:14.763
That would be permissible.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.070
Maybe hope is what changes lightbulbs.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:18.811
Right.

00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:20.512
We just have to hope.

00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:21.333
Hope.

00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:22.053
Not do it.

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:22.914
Just hope.

00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:25.136
Just hope.

00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:26.657
Don't do, just hope.

00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:29.260
Is that how the lightbulb gets changed?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.280
Hope.

00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:32.703
Hope brightens up our day.

00:17:33.223 --> 00:17:36.005
Hope will change the lightbulbs and brighten up our room.

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:36.326
Okay.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.186
Okay.

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:37.467
Yeah.

00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:38.928
Makes sense, I guess.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:41.270
Solved!

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.890
Solved!

00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:45.822
Somehow.

00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:10.569
And this time, it's truly, actually, really not our fault.

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:12.090
It really isn't.

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:14.372
You believe us, right, Ruffians?

00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:17.275
Right.

00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:23.601
You know, sometimes after a stream,

00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:29.373
What did Fuwawa say last stream that was so weird?

00:18:29.493 --> 00:18:30.454
I don't remember anything.

00:18:30.474 --> 00:18:32.235
And I'll watch and think, well...

00:18:49.639 --> 00:18:56.201
I guess if you take it out of context, maybe that could sound a little strange to some Ruffians.

00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:02.603
But recently, I've been seeing a bunch of videos!

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:10.385
Especially from our last Sakura Wars 5 stream, where Taiga answers the phone with no clothes on.

00:19:10.405 --> 00:19:14.606
You know, for some reason,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:26.975
Multiple videos imply that Fuwawa wants to be in a state of undress rather than wear clothes.

00:19:27.515 --> 00:19:29.856
When she didn't say anything like that at all!

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:31.097
I didn't say anything.

00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:33.498
I didn't say anything like that, Ruffians.

00:19:33.518 --> 00:19:33.638
No!

00:19:33.758 --> 00:19:35.579
Are your ears okay?

00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:45.336
You know, it was in the moment we were just both very taken aback by Taiga answering the phone with no clothes on.

00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:47.598
That's unthinkable.

00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:48.298
And you know what?

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:57.986
Fuwawa is more confused by him saying that he needs to change his clothes, which then further implies that he wasn't wearing any, you know, to begin with.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.442
You know, we were just confused by the situation.

00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:04.344
It's not a normal situation.

00:20:04.364 --> 00:20:10.829
And you know, Fuwawa never said anything about enjoying being cool or not.

00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:19.296
I think Ruffians, I think Moco-chan would've realized a long time ago if I didn't wear clothes regularly, you know?

00:20:19.316 --> 00:20:20.417
Of course!

00:20:20.898 --> 00:20:22.699
I like my fluffy pajamas!

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:23.520
They're cute!

00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.663
You know, Fuwawa says many silly things.

00:20:28.283 --> 00:20:31.065
And sometimes I say silly things.

00:20:31.926 --> 00:20:38.470
And sometimes, maybe sometimes, they can be misunderstood.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:39.331
But...

00:20:40.137 --> 00:20:42.839
This is a time where we're not at fault, truly.

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:47.041
So please don't go making up misunderstandings, okay?

00:20:47.101 --> 00:20:47.601
Yeah.

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:48.642
I think that's enough.

00:20:49.002 --> 00:20:55.245
We say enough silly things and we never mean for it to come out like how you might sometimes want to talk with them.

00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:57.046
Okay, Ruffians.

00:20:58.207 --> 00:21:00.528
Maybe Ruffians are just a bit silly, huh?

00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:02.069
Silly Ruffians.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.611
You understand though, right?

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.412
Understood.

00:21:07.972 --> 00:21:08.633
Understood.

00:21:11.326 --> 00:21:12.167
I got it right.

00:21:14.268 --> 00:21:15.909
Dogenzan!

00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:18.150
It's not Iphone!

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.391
I understood!

00:21:19.731 --> 00:21:26.214
Maybe you need like a mimikaki ASMR or something and then maybe you'll hear it a little bit better after that.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:27.395
Right.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:28.535
That's not up to us.

00:21:28.735 --> 00:21:29.416
Understood!

00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:31.177
Understood!

00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:32.658
Good.

00:21:32.698 --> 00:21:34.819
Good, good, good.

00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:35.999
I'm happy.

00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:41.381
BAU BAU!

00:21:43.477 --> 00:21:50.518
There are things that can get us quite worked up too.

00:22:12.543 --> 00:22:13.964
Grumpy FUWAMOCO.

00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:26.557
You know, for example, one thing that makes us exceedingly grumpy, you know, is this.

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:30.360
People who budge in line.

00:22:31.894 --> 00:22:35.775
You know, we have a pretty strong sense of justice as demon guard dogs.

00:22:36.215 --> 00:22:39.056
You know, sometimes a bit to a fault.

00:22:39.936 --> 00:22:44.217
But we don't like being too aggressive unless it's really necessary.

00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:51.599
So especially if in line we see somebody budge in front of another person, not necessarily us.

00:22:52.557 --> 00:22:53.838
We get pretty grumpy.

00:22:53.978 --> 00:22:57.520
I think it's the worst if it's not us, if it's a different person.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:57.761
Right!

00:22:57.781 --> 00:23:01.483
I get angry on their behalf!

00:23:01.643 --> 00:23:06.406
But we do try to give the person that, like, what's the benefit of it, you know?

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:08.848
And I think maybe like, oh, they're just confused.

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:09.969
Maybe they just...

00:23:10.749 --> 00:23:13.912
It's just entirely clueless about the world around them.

00:23:13.952 --> 00:23:15.694
It's okay, sometimes it's like that.

00:23:15.914 --> 00:23:21.120
But even then it can still make us feel pretty hot sometimes.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.921
So RuffianS!

00:23:23.122 --> 00:23:29.668
Please try to be aware about the world around you so that you don't accidentally budge a line, okay?

00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:32.611
You wouldn't want to make us grumpy, right?

00:23:32.631 --> 00:23:35.874
But I feel like if someone says, Oh, excuse me.

00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:36.875
I'm in a rush.

00:23:36.935 --> 00:23:38.557
Is it okay if I go in front of you?

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:39.278
Please go ahead.

00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:40.238
That's totally fine.

00:23:40.278 --> 00:23:40.859
You asked.

00:23:41.199 --> 00:23:42.481
You gave a reason.

00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:43.321
That's fine.

00:23:44.102 --> 00:23:45.243
I'd be happy to.

00:23:45.283 --> 00:23:45.584
Yes.

00:23:46.004 --> 00:23:46.224
But...

00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:48.625
You have to communicate.

00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:51.226
Use manner.

00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:59.088
Otherwise, we're gonna be grumpy and you know, we wouldn't want to have to BAU BAU you back into your proper sport and life, right?

00:23:59.128 --> 00:24:00.448
You wouldn't want that, huh?

00:24:00.628 --> 00:24:01.029
Right?

00:24:01.709 --> 00:24:02.489
Okay, right.

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:06.370
It's really important to pay attention and be kind to others, okay?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.470
Yeah.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.010
Be understanding.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.431
But, it makes us grumpy.

00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:11.331
Grumpy.

00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:14.532
Grumpy FUWAMOCO and people budget line!

00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:20.677
Not many things make us grumpy.

00:24:20.837 --> 00:24:22.278
But that's one of them.

00:24:22.818 --> 00:24:25.119
Maybe you'll find out the other ones.

00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:30.223
Well, it's Wednesday.

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:31.424
It is.

00:24:32.164 --> 00:24:36.227
And I think the Ruffians have been trying hard.

00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:39.449
So I wanted to say something!

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.869
Hi.

00:24:47.177 --> 00:24:48.057
Good morning!

00:24:48.077 --> 00:24:52.839
Good morning!

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.940
You know who I am.

00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.582
It's me, Mococo!

00:25:00.402 --> 00:25:01.923
And you know what I'm about to say.

00:25:01.943 --> 00:25:02.023
Yeah!

00:25:06.645 --> 00:25:09.766
It's time for another Mococo Pup Talk!

00:25:10.807 --> 00:25:13.187
And this time, you're gonna hear from me, Mococo!

00:25:14.963 --> 00:25:17.708
You know, I know the days are getting shorter.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.478
The sun comes up later, it leaves our side earlier.

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:26.866
You know, it can be hard to keep your eyes open sometimes.

00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:28.463
BAU!

00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:31.347
I'll be your ice-cold shower!

00:25:31.987 --> 00:25:32.288
BAU!

00:25:32.868 --> 00:25:34.590
Your nice warm shower!

00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.332
Whichever you need, okay?

00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:41.158
And you know, despite all the changes around us, you're still continuing on!

00:25:41.638 --> 00:25:43.480
Continuing BAU BAU-ing!

00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:46.644
Because it's business as usual.

00:25:47.144 --> 00:25:47.345
Right?

00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:50.012
You can do it!

00:25:50.452 --> 00:25:51.393
I know you can!

00:25:52.133 --> 00:25:59.317
Even if things get tough, and it takes more time, and you feel like you aren't as efficient as usual, don't worry!

00:25:59.818 --> 00:26:04.060
You're doing your best, and that's leagues better than not doing anything.

00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:11.865
You know, one step a day is seven steps a week, and within no time, you'll be somewhere new.

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:15.587
So don't worry, and just continue on!

00:26:16.588 --> 00:26:18.249
I believe you'll be all okay!

00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:19.950
Let's do it together, okay?

00:26:20.591 --> 00:26:22.052
Stay strong!

00:26:23.352 --> 00:26:29.036
But first, let's take a deep breath and BAU BAU together, okay?

00:26:29.897 --> 00:26:30.257
You good?

00:26:31.478 --> 00:26:35.480
Okay, here we go.

00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:40.764
3... 2... 1... BAU BAU!

00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:41.904
See ya!

00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:43.986
We believe in you!

00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:45.367
Ganbatte ne!

00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:49.272
BAU BAU!

00:26:59.352 --> 00:27:04.214
Well, maybe we should check out our regular coordinates for the day, Moco-chan!

00:27:04.614 --> 00:27:06.995
This is the Doggie of the Day!

00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:09.215
Who is our doggy today?

00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:13.177
It's Reggie!

00:27:14.537 --> 00:27:21.859
Reggie is a sleepy little chub who puts a priority on getting a good night and a day's rest.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.180
I respect that.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.300
I appreciate that.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.361
Look, Reggie's giving me a look like,

00:27:26.681 --> 00:27:27.462
I'm sleeping here.

00:27:27.482 --> 00:27:30.003
Why are you taking a photo of me?

00:27:30.864 --> 00:27:33.766
It's good to get lots of sleep.

00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:42.432
I think it would be hard getting out of bed when your dog bed looks as comfy as that one too.

00:27:45.354 --> 00:27:48.377
Reggie look very cute and very comfy.

00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:52.060
How do you think Reggie BAU BAU is?

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.741
Is he sleepy head?

00:27:54.041 --> 00:27:57.364
He only lets out a little bark to let you know he's around?

00:27:57.404 --> 00:27:58.405
Like don't step on me.

00:28:04.336 --> 00:28:18.367
You know, Regi, he might be off in dreamland often, but I think that's just because he's trying to set a good example for you.

00:28:18.528 --> 00:28:19.608
Exactly.

00:28:19.628 --> 00:28:20.950
Good example, Regi.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.974
He thinks maybe that you work a bit too hard and that you need to stop

00:28:26.414 --> 00:28:29.616
Need to curl up for a good rest together, you know?

00:28:29.636 --> 00:28:31.357
Together with him!

00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:31.697
Right?

00:28:32.017 --> 00:28:34.599
So, Ruffian, what are you waiting for?

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:41.043
Go curl up with Regi and have sweet tea!

00:28:41.263 --> 00:28:42.144
Extra rest for.

00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:42.884
Right?

00:28:42.964 --> 00:28:45.946
BAU BAU!

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:49.148
Today, I went for a walk.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.452
Where did this Ruffian go for a walk?

00:28:52.732 --> 00:28:54.934
De-den!

00:28:57.075 --> 00:28:58.757
Look at the dragonfly!

00:28:58.817 --> 00:29:01.199
It's so beautiful!

00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:03.380
It's kinda chunky like Regi too, huh?

00:29:04.421 --> 00:29:05.322
I guess kind of.

00:29:05.442 --> 00:29:09.665
Usually dragonflies are a bit more, like, I don't know, graceful.

00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:10.586
Graceful!

00:29:15.832 --> 00:29:18.896
I think that's pretty graceful.

00:29:18.936 --> 00:29:20.439
He's like a sun dragonfly.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.242
I guess, I guess.

00:29:22.462 --> 00:29:25.447
But you know dragonflies, they're pretty cool but...

00:29:27.268 --> 00:29:34.717
I'm kind of scared of them, Mococchan and I. You know, they're big and they fly around and around eye-high.

00:29:34.857 --> 00:29:38.322
And then, you know, they never seem to know where they're going either.

00:29:38.342 --> 00:29:40.765
They're just... Right.

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:43.047
I don't want them to bash into us.

00:29:43.608 --> 00:29:44.309
You know it.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.151
They can bite hard too.

00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:49.509
I still remember.

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:51.810
I keep my distance.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.772
But it looks like you were safe because he's blinded and not moving around.

00:29:57.072 --> 00:30:00.374
He's alive though, right?

00:30:00.414 --> 00:30:04.135
We're glad that you spotted a really cool giant right there!

00:30:04.175 --> 00:30:06.156
Just keep your distance.

00:30:06.536 --> 00:30:11.279
But you really never know what kind of cool things you'll stumble across when you go out for a walk, right?

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:11.659
Right!

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.771
You know, the other day, I was sitting like this Ruffian, and I saw a worm.

00:30:18.232 --> 00:30:19.272
I was pretty excited.

00:30:20.112 --> 00:30:20.632
A worm?

00:30:20.732 --> 00:30:21.012
Yeah.

00:30:21.533 --> 00:30:23.373
I thought that it's a pretty big worm.

00:30:23.873 --> 00:30:24.554
I was impressed.

00:30:26.854 --> 00:30:28.095
Worms can be impressive.

00:30:28.115 --> 00:30:28.835
They can be.

00:30:28.915 --> 00:30:32.456
Worms are doing their thing.

00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:34.757
BAU BAU!

00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:38.738
And for our Question of the Day!

00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:42.985
We have... De-den!

00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:46.066
I, FUWAMOCO, have reached 100,000 videos on the channel!

00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:46.546
Thank you!

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:48.047
Thank you!

00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:53.570
I wonder which stream was the most challenging to prepare for so far, other than debut, of course.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.391
And which was the most rewarding?

00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:56.051
BAU BAU!

00:30:56.191 --> 00:30:57.832
BAU BAU!

00:30:57.852 --> 00:30:59.693
Ah, this is a good question.

00:31:00.834 --> 00:31:08.518
Obviously, there's a lot of preparation going on in the back for a lot of things that you might not notice, Ruffians, but- You're not supposed to.

00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:10.179
You're not supposed to, that's okay.

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:14.841
But, by far, FUWAMOCO Morning is the most demanding!

00:31:15.022 --> 00:31:16.082
Yeah.

00:31:17.823 --> 00:31:18.383
Surprised?

00:31:19.884 --> 00:31:28.208
You may think it's just 30 minutes, but it actually takes much, much more time than that to prepare!

00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:29.069
Yeah.

00:31:30.393 --> 00:31:36.718
You know, we wake up three hours before every FUWAMOCO Morning to continue preparing everything.

00:31:36.738 --> 00:31:40.560
And then we separate the tasks amongst ourselves too, you know.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:48.226
It takes a lot of work and preparation to be able to meet you early like this almost every other day of the week.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:52.188
But I think it's worth it to make your day a little brighter.

00:31:52.969 --> 00:31:56.812
You know, especially before you have all those rough parts each day.

00:31:57.052 --> 00:31:59.814
Yeah, so it means a lot when

00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:02.536
We hear that FUWAMOCO means a lot to you too.

00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:03.496
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:04.117 --> 00:32:06.138
Ah, yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:06.178 --> 00:32:08.960
But also FUWAMOCO means a lot to you too.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:09.820
Yeah.

00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:19.286
But otherwise, we maybe like to have some more prep-heavy streams that involve more homework that we'd like to do in the future.

00:32:20.027 --> 00:32:25.831
But, again, it takes a lot of work so it's hard to balance with everything else we have going on too.

00:32:26.894 --> 00:32:27.174
What?

00:32:29.456 --> 00:32:29.856
Balance.

00:32:30.757 --> 00:32:31.937
It's tricky, you know?

00:32:32.038 --> 00:32:35.700
But we'll continue working hard!

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.942
BAU BAU!

00:32:38.002 --> 00:32:41.604
Thank you for all your submissions today too!

00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:44.506
We're always looking forward to all your updates.

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:47.768
For more questions, questions, questions, questions.

00:32:47.828 --> 00:32:48.609
For more vlogs.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.330
Thank you.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:57.632
FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make all together, Ruffians, so don't forget that, okay?

00:32:57.652 --> 00:32:59.832
BAU BAU!

00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:03.053
Why don't we take a peek at our next stream?

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:12.275
Our next stream is, if you know today, the day of the week, it is time for Resident Evil 4 Wednesday!

00:33:13.535 --> 00:33:16.196
We're back to Resident Evil 4.

00:33:17.916 --> 00:33:19.759
Yeah, we're playing the remake.

00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:24.507
We just made it back to the village and are going to head inside the church.

00:33:25.008 --> 00:33:30.336
You know, the church where all the grandmas and grandpas headed in, so they're so, so hurried.

00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.899
I don't know why.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.891
Then we're gonna hurt us really badly and then it's like, no!

00:33:36.732 --> 00:33:37.392
It's great.

00:33:37.912 --> 00:33:38.653
Don't question.

00:33:38.673 --> 00:33:41.514
But hopefully things don't get too much scarier.

00:33:41.974 --> 00:33:44.256
And also hopefully Moco-chan gets better at shooting.

00:33:46.076 --> 00:33:53.180
But also, make sure that you're logged in and are all enough Ruffians to watch, okay?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:34:00.263
It can be a little scary at times, so... But if you can't watch, what else do we have?

00:34:00.323 --> 00:34:01.084
Well...

00:34:02.024 --> 00:34:02.424
That's all.

00:34:02.604 --> 00:34:03.005
That's all.

00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:29.895

00:34:32.957 --> 00:34:34.277
Wow, Ruffians.

00:34:34.297 --> 00:34:40.200
That brings our 31st FUWAMOCO Morning to an end.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.302
Thank you so much for joining us today this morning!

00:34:44.342 --> 00:34:51.465
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
