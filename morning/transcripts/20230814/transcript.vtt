Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.112

00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:18.078

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.163

As always, here we are for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:47.308
As always.

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:48.969
It's our 6th episode, but as always.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.349
As always, yes.

00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:56.772

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:57.672

Hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:16.350
If you say it like that everyone's gonna smell it funny.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.951
F-W-M-C.

00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:19.252
You should know now, right?

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:20.132
Yeah, you know.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.834
Right, Ruffians?

00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:25.976
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:28.778
BAU BAU!

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.560
Yeah, Ruffians, you know, right?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.222
You know, right, yeah.

00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:35.603
And this is just in!

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:42.047
There's been another Pero Sighting!

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.020
Ruffians, we saw Pero!

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.501
Where is he now?

00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:49.483
Where is he now?

00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:55.148
Ruffians reported seeing him at... Where is this?

00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:56.369
Medieval Europe?

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:57.329
A movie!

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:00.726
He's in the arms of a wizard.

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:04.389
The arms of a wizard?

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.831
He looks powerful.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.353
Pero or a wizard?

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:13.199
I guess a wizard, but Moco-chan, do you think you could beat him up and get Pero back for us?

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.899
A wizard or Pero?

00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:16.022
Both!

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:17.763
Maybe teach Pero some manners?

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.605
I think I could beat up Pero.

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:21.247
I think I could.

00:07:21.287 --> 00:07:22.668
The wizard, I don't know.

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:24.050
He's wearing purple.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.974
I really like the purple gown.

00:07:27.994 --> 00:07:29.275
It's very suiting for him.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.619
The way he's touching, he's just caressing.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.481
Caressing Pero, yeah.

00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:35.201
They're new friends.

00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:41.513
But yeah, it does look like the wizard really, really taken a liking to him.

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:43.374
He's looking very wistfully at him.

00:07:43.414 --> 00:07:45.415
You can see the love in his eyes.

00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:47.896
Moco-chan, do you think we could ever get Pero back?

00:07:49.877 --> 00:07:50.777
Do we want him back?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.198
That's true.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:54.739
He is pretty nasty, right, Ruffian?

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:58.781
Maybe we'll be okay without him.

00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:02.622
But, you know, demon dogs also need to stick together.

00:08:02.703 --> 00:08:03.303
So...

00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:05.376
Pero is nasty.

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:07.478
Sometimes he can be not so nice.

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:12.142
Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more Pero Sightings, okay?

00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:15.906
Remember to use the hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:16.946
Let us know.

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:18.368
We have to find him, I guess.

00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:20.390
He'll be lost without us.

00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:26.900
Well we have some good news too!

00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:37.194
I guess if you tuned into a FUWAMOCO welcome or party you might already know, but Holo Abyss's original song, Rebellion, has hit 1 million views!

00:08:37.414 --> 00:08:39.117
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:43.400
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.104
Thank you, Adventrix, for listening to it so, so much.

00:08:48.124 --> 00:08:49.245
You've been listening, right?

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:54.209
You've been jumping up and putting your paws up and going, jump, jump, jump!

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:56.411
Maybe BAU BAUing a bit there, too.

00:08:56.451 --> 00:08:56.771
Thank you!

00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:59.273
Actually, my favorite part in Rebellion

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:09.420
It kind of makes me emotional too, but it's actually a part that Moco-chan and I, we both sing.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.003
Well, we kind of split it in the middle, but it's the, I know that I can still be the future of my story.

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:19.165
You have to sort of sing it.

00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:21.126
The future of my story.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:23.807
It's a good part.

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:26.209
It means a lot to us, you know?

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:31.611
We hope that we can dance around with you and all of us together on a big stage, you know?

00:09:32.092 --> 00:09:34.413
Would you like to see that, Ruffians?

00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:36.663
Oh!

00:09:36.984 --> 00:09:39.205
Shiori's plate's your favorite too!

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:40.827
It's my favorite too.

00:09:40.927 --> 00:09:41.727
And Biboo's.

00:09:41.908 --> 00:09:47.072
Thank you!

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:52.516
Oh, you know, actually, Mama Puppy says that she's been listening to it a lot.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.438
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:09:55.038 --> 00:10:02.703
Yeah, plus we don't really think she's the kind to listen to such a pop-pop party song, so it's a bit funny to imagine, really.

00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:04.705
She really likes it, though.

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:08.467
Yeah, maybe it's a song that's popular with moms, too.

00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:10.088
Ruffians, what do you think?

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.450
Would your mom like it?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.631
Maybe you should let your mom know.

00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:16.452
Yeah.

00:10:16.973 --> 00:10:19.374
Yeah, my mom likes a song called Rebellion.

00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:20.275
Rebellion.

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:21.596
Rebellion.

00:10:21.656 --> 00:10:21.856
Yeah.

00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:24.258
Thank you!

00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:26.079
It's a good idea.

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:27.219
Thank you!

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.161
Also, in more good news.

00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:32.302
More good news.

00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:33.263
Wow.

00:10:33.563 --> 00:10:35.324
The demon of sound.

00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:35.825
Not sound.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:36.425
Not sound.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:36.765
Yeah.

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:41.588
Yeah, the lovely Nerissa Ravencroft.

00:10:42.148 --> 00:10:47.512
She's just released her brand new cover of Kami Poina of Godish!

00:10:47.612 --> 00:10:47.932
Godish!

00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:49.253
And you know what?

00:10:50.614 --> 00:10:53.036
It is truly goddess.

00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:54.357
Not soup, sound.

00:10:54.457 --> 00:10:55.778
Sound, sound, sound, yeah.

00:10:55.858 --> 00:10:57.019
Kamipoina, no.

00:10:57.119 --> 00:10:59.061
No, there's no soup in there, but there's sound.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:08.768
I think, for FUWAMOCO, when we think of Kamipoina, we immediately, we just can't help but think of Bae-senpai's amazing performance.

00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:09.849
Yeah, it was too good.

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:10.509
Yeah, right?

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:11.170
At 4th Fest.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:17.414
But, you know, Nerissa's Kamipoina, it stands out in a way that's totally unique to her.

00:11:17.494 --> 00:11:19.136
It's Nerissa's goddess now.

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:20.977
Yeah.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:26.663
And this time, you know, she's singing in Japanese, which with Love Me Love Me, it was in English, right?

00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:28.405
So it's a bit of a different side, right?

00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:30.327
You can kind of compare.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.131
This is what Nerusa sounds like in Japanese.

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.914
It's a nice, like, different shift between the two songs.

00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:37.175
Yeah.

00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:43.799
Please, please go take a listen, go take a check out on it.

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:46.520
And let us know what you think in the comments too, okay?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.602
Congratulations on the release!

00:11:50.702 --> 00:11:51.763
Abyss strong!

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.003
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:53.143 --> 00:11:55.564
Abyss strong!

00:11:55.904 --> 00:11:57.305
So much good news today.

00:11:57.405 --> 00:11:59.586
What's the good news?

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:00.526
What's the good news?

00:12:00.546 --> 00:12:01.187
What's the good news?

00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:07.490
Well, and like always, we have our Misunderstanding Corner.

00:12:08.752 --> 00:12:11.680
But, but actually... Actually!

00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:18.567
What are you doing?

00:12:18.587 --> 00:12:20.689
Today is something new!

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.610
We had no misunderstandings!

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.731
No misunderstandings.

00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.631
It's our first time!

00:12:24.651 --> 00:12:26.392
Yeah, are you proud of us, Ruffians?

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:27.713
Are you?

00:12:27.733 --> 00:12:28.493
Are you?

00:12:28.573 --> 00:12:29.014
No.

00:12:29.034 --> 00:12:29.074
No.

00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:30.114
No.

00:12:30.134 --> 00:12:30.174
No.

00:12:30.475 --> 00:12:30.935
No.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.298
Look, you know we went on it without any misunderstandings.

00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:37.379
This is great.

00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:38.399
It's good news.

00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:40.701
Momentous day.

00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:42.282
What do you mean, no?

00:12:42.502 --> 00:12:42.822
No.

00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:44.163
What do you mean, no?

00:12:44.403 --> 00:12:45.083
What do you mean?

00:12:45.103 --> 00:12:47.145
Do you think we had some?

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:53.025
Do you think that we had some?

00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:55.026
We'll find one!

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:57.326
You don't have to make them.

00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:01.327
No misunderstandings today.

00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:06.108
Very happy momentous moment.

00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:11.729
You know, destroying all the buildings in EDF2, you know that wasn't a misunderstanding either.

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:14.150
That's why it's not on here.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.211
That was just us having fun, you know, playing around.

00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.112
Yeah, we did a good job of getting you apartments.

00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:23.092
Yeah, we got you a new apartment.

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:25.273
We didn't blow it up, we got you a new one, okay?

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:26.033
Right?

00:13:26.313 --> 00:13:27.453
Yeah, just cleaning the waste.

00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:30.394
Yeah, it's not a misunderstanding, okay?

00:13:30.454 --> 00:13:32.815
Yeah, Ruffians, you should be proud of us.

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:33.935
Yeah, proud of us.

00:13:33.975 --> 00:13:36.696
Let's all hope for no more misunderstandings.

00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:38.656
No, nothing about Sakura Wars.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:39.156
No.

00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:39.876
No.

00:13:40.096 --> 00:13:40.336
Yeah.

00:13:41.097 --> 00:13:44.858
Let's all hope for more days without misunderstandings, okay?

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:46.138
What?

00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:49.718
I'm happy about that one, Moco-chan.

00:13:49.738 --> 00:13:51.760
It's a good surprise, right?

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.621
It's a really good surprise.

00:13:55.383 --> 00:13:56.884
Also another surprise!

00:13:57.224 --> 00:14:01.448
You know, we've been receiving more and more questions about Pero from the Ruffians.

00:14:01.468 --> 00:14:06.072
You know, as we try to find out where he is, locate his whereabouts.

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:09.395
Information is important when trying to find him, right?

00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:13.498
You know, Pero, he's been our pet for so long, we don't really think that

00:14:13.938 --> 00:14:17.682
But now that he's not here, do you feel sort of lonely?

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:36.965
He's grumpy though, so like usually just the conversation kind of stops when we can stop it.

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:43.431
And yeah, you know, all of us, we did really appreciate his help, you know, helping us borrow things while we were on the cell.

00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:44.652
It is important, I guess.

00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:45.793
Yeah, you know.

00:14:46.073 --> 00:14:46.974
No disrespect.

00:14:47.034 --> 00:14:47.694
No disrespect.

00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:48.395
No, no, no.

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:54.640
But I thought, you know, at the very least, we thought maybe we could try and learn a little bit more about him since, you know,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.946
He is an important part of our gang after all, right?

00:14:59.547 --> 00:14:59.727
Look!

00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:00.629
Ruffians!

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:02.412
We found something.

00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:06.658
We found some of Pero's medical records.

00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:07.139
Here we are.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.261
It's his x-ray.

00:15:10.321 --> 00:15:11.461
It's his x-ray.

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:14.623
It's a bit personal, but you know, it's important.

00:15:14.743 --> 00:15:15.624
It's important, you know?

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:15.904
Yeah.

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:16.624
What do you think?

00:15:16.905 --> 00:15:22.968
Oh, you know, uh, I guess we kind of, uh, we didn't get his permission, but I think it's okay.

00:15:23.068 --> 00:15:23.469
It's okay.

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:24.789
It's his x-ray.

00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:27.171
Out of the room, out of the deal, like they said, right?

00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:28.391
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:28.432 --> 00:15:31.714
He's very fluffy looking, but maybe not so much on the inside.

00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:31.774
No.

00:15:33.134 --> 00:15:34.515
I think that's appropriate for him.

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.696
Look, he does have bones, though.

00:15:37.117 --> 00:15:46.061
And, you know, if we need to take desperate measures, and he doesn't quite make it, you know, there's a bone for each of us to know, Moco-chan.

00:15:46.402 --> 00:15:47.182
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:48.403
We don't need to share this time.

00:15:48.423 --> 00:15:49.683
Yeah, we can have one each.

00:15:49.964 --> 00:15:50.184
Good.

00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:51.965
Oh, that's very kind of you.

00:15:52.005 --> 00:15:53.185
Yeah, very considerate.

00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:53.666
Yeah.

00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:55.967
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:06.837
Flubbery.

00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:07.618
Flubbery?

00:16:07.678 --> 00:16:08.859
He sort of just goes around.

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:10.280
He's a bit fluffy, a bit fuzzy.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.062
Yeah, but you know, I think there's bones inside.

00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:17.325
I think maybe we shouldn't look much further, you know?

00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:20.127
The mysteries stay mysteries.

00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:20.947
Pero's Pero.

00:16:20.987 --> 00:16:22.108
He has two bones.

00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:23.950
Yeah, just two bones there.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.832
Yeah, any further and it'd be a bit of an invasion of privacy.

00:16:27.672 --> 00:16:29.113
No matter how you want to look at it.

00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:30.913
Pero!

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.574
Thank you for your medical info.

00:16:33.614 --> 00:16:35.655
Thank you for sharing it with all of us today.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.976
Even though you didn't tell us because you're not here.

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:40.657
Thanks, Pero!

00:16:40.677 --> 00:16:41.497
Thank you!

00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:43.518
That was very kind, right?

00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.778
Right, Ruffians?

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:47.939
Pero's spineless?

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:48.920
Yeah.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.540
Yeah.

00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:59.360
Ruffians, over the weekend we were on Kiara-senpai's holotalk with our holoalbum.

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.180
What did you think?

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.361
We played lots of fun games, right?

00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:17.502
Games, we did pictures.

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:21.445
You know, we talked a lot about a lot of different things.

00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.706
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:28.209
But yeah, you know, we were able to kind of learn a bit more about what makes Advent Advent.

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:32.870
And I had a lot of fun.

00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:42.314
But actually, you know, Hiyara-senpai also mentioned how she was really surprised how serious we were and we were doing the warm-ups backstage in preparation and everything.

00:17:42.654 --> 00:17:45.135
But you know, we also mentioned in the Crunchyroll, right?

00:17:45.175 --> 00:17:50.937
Yeah, you know, we mentioned that we warm up every day.

00:17:51.117 --> 00:17:52.717
Yeah, we always warm up our voices.

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:58.681
As Ruffians, as you know, we can get very emotional.

00:17:58.722 --> 00:17:59.802
We're emotional puppies.

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.084
So when we're excited, we BAU BAU.

00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:05.948
When we're scared, I guess we scream.

00:18:05.968 --> 00:18:11.353
So you know, we're always making sure to take care of our puppies.

00:18:11.393 --> 00:18:16.217
You know, because all that excitement and screaming could take a bit of a toll, you know?

00:18:17.658 --> 00:18:21.159
And it's actually scientifically proven that your barker... Science.

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:22.839
We're talking a lot about science today.

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:28.201
But it's scientifically proven that your barker isn't awake until after 3 hours after you wake up.

00:18:28.421 --> 00:18:31.761
So we always make sure to wake up 3 hours before a stream.

00:18:32.181 --> 00:18:35.522
And then we always properly warm up for at least 10 minutes before.

00:18:36.442 --> 00:18:41.184
But, as Moco-chan demonstrated, it can be a bit noisy.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.124
It's a bit noisy.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.981
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:45.761
Right.

00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:49.063
And sometimes, you know, we also do mouth warm-ups.

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:50.584
You know, like, can we do it together?

00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:50.884
Okay.

00:18:51.544 --> 00:18:57.567
Pretty little puppy, pretty little puppy, pretty little puppy, pretty little puppy dog.

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:58.568
Like that.

00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:01.229
You know, it's important, you know.

00:19:01.269 --> 00:19:05.051
You gotta get the mouth warmed up, the barker warmed up, those kind of things.

00:19:05.471 --> 00:19:06.232
Very serious.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:10.754
Yeah, you know, cause like, if we don't take care of it, then our barker will start to

00:19:11.014 --> 00:19:15.155
Get tired and then it'll be hard to spend as much time as we want to with you.

00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:17.996
We want to be able to spend as much time as we can together.

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:20.917
We're always making sure to take proper care of you.

00:19:21.137 --> 00:19:21.857
Very important.

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:25.138
You know, we also drink a special tea and have cough drops.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:28.119
It all helps our howls come out more smoothly.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:30.920
It's always on our minds.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.641
Ruffians, you make sure to take care of yourself too.

00:19:36.282 --> 00:19:36.902
We actually...

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:45.228
We actually visited a very special doctor right before our debut.

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:51.050
It was a bit scary too.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.772
We didn't really want to, but we knew it was important.

00:19:55.352 --> 00:19:57.353
We went to see the doctor.

00:19:57.453 --> 00:20:00.114
She did a scope to look at our vocal cords.

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.876
You know, BAU BAU'd a bunch.

00:20:04.156 --> 00:20:07.980
We had to sing to all of Happy Birthday while she did the test too.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.221
It was a bit scary.

00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:13.365
Yeah, you know it's different singing with a camera down your throat.

00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:21.191
Yeah, it's not... But it was really really worth it because she told us that our parkour looks really healthy.

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:21.892
Healthy.

00:20:22.092 --> 00:20:24.334
Really happy and ready to howl.

00:20:24.354 --> 00:20:24.434
Yeah.

00:20:26.656 --> 00:20:29.700
Moco-chan, I was actually really proud of you too.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.604
Moco-chan, Ruffians, did you know she's a very scary puppy at times?

00:20:33.905 --> 00:20:34.325
I'm not!

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:37.279
I'm a big strong guard dog, okay?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.901
Usually I try to get Moco-chan to go first, because if I go first, then she's going to get all scared.

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:45.622
And I accidentally went first.

00:20:46.722 --> 00:20:49.122
But you know, Moco-chan did it without any complaints.

00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:50.843
No tears, you know.

00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:53.324
I had to be strong for the Ruffians.

00:20:53.724 --> 00:21:02.406
But yeah, you know, we want to be able to spend as much time as we can with you, so being healthy is a very important part of that, alright?

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:09.549
You know, so make sure to have lots of water, lots of tea, do a warm up.

00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:13.730
We'll make sure we continue to take care of the best of our Barkers, you know?

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.911
There's other things, you know.

00:21:15.171 --> 00:21:18.652
Maybe not have so many Puppertinos, you know, because there's caffeine.

00:21:18.692 --> 00:21:19.733
Caffeine is not good.

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:21.914
But most importantly, sleep.

00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:22.834
Sleep.

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.314
We'll work hard at that part.

00:21:24.354 --> 00:21:26.195
We need to work a bit harder at that part.

00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:29.437
But yeah, Ruffians, please take care of yourselves too, okay?

00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:30.357
Because, you know,

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:33.959
We're gonna take care of ourselves so that we can spend a lot of time with you.

00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:38.082
So you need to make sure that you take care of yourself so you can spend a lot of time with us too.

00:21:38.222 --> 00:21:39.743
Even if the doctor is a bit scary.

00:21:40.043 --> 00:21:41.885
Even if the doctor is scary, yeah.

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:42.545
Okay!

00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:43.206
Okay!

00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:44.907
Ruffians, you understand?

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:46.998
Okay.

00:21:47.558 --> 00:21:47.998
BAU BAU!

00:21:48.499 --> 00:21:49.499
Mococo did good!

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:50.499
BAU BAU!

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:51.639
I don't see that.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.641
I want to see Mococo do good!

00:21:55.701 --> 00:21:56.221
BAU BAU!

00:21:56.301 --> 00:21:57.921
Okay, Ruffians, I understand.

00:21:59.142 --> 00:22:01.742
Neru-san, you too!

00:22:01.903 --> 00:22:03.123
That goes for you, Neru-san.

00:22:06.544 --> 00:22:07.704
Wow, Moco-chan!

00:22:07.844 --> 00:22:09.785
Let's take a look at our Doggie of the Day.

00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:16.461
Today's Doggie of the Day is... It's Beck!

00:22:16.681 --> 00:22:19.883
Beck is super cute!

00:22:26.383 --> 00:22:30.426
Here it's written that Beck's charm point is her cute floppy face.

00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:31.827
I have to agree.

00:22:31.847 --> 00:22:36.511
Moco-chan, I'm fluffy, you're fuzzy, and Beck is floppy.

00:22:37.512 --> 00:22:38.192
Makes sense.

00:22:39.093 --> 00:22:41.515
So cute!

00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:44.197
I want to ruffle and fluff the wrinkles.

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:45.918
I want to stretch.

00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:53.841
Actually though, I was wondering, do you get maybe confused between what's the sofa and what's the back?

00:22:54.662 --> 00:22:55.962
They look very similar, right?

00:22:55.982 --> 00:22:56.523
A bit similar.

00:22:56.563 --> 00:22:58.463
You know they have both the wrinkles?

00:23:00.304 --> 00:23:02.745
Please don't get mixed up.

00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:03.906
For Becca's sake, okay?

00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:06.027
It could be easy, but...

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:07.968
How does Beck sound?

00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:08.849
How does he BAU BAU?

00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:10.810
I think Beck is maybe more like BAU BAU BAU.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.651
She seems very reserved.

00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.471
Very polite.

00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:37.847
I would say Beck's reading is, you know, Beck's the best friend who loves to snuggle, watch shows together, maybe have a little popcorn that you drop here and there.

00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:39.908
Fan of popcorn.

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:41.269
A soft sofa pal.

00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:41.789
Very very cute.

00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:42.170
Thank you!

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:42.610
Bye bye!

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.331
Bye bye Beck!

00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:54.537
And for our next quitter, today I went for a walk.

00:23:55.017 --> 00:24:00.761
You're gonna keep on messing up the title!

00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:03.903
Today I went on a walk.

00:24:04.163 --> 00:24:04.843
De-den!

00:24:06.925 --> 00:24:09.166
You went to Comic Market!

00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:13.129
Where you can see all the people of Tokyo Big Sight.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.719
I feel like this is more like going into battle than just simply going for a walk though, right?

00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:19.480
No, it's a bit different.

00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:21.103
A walk usually isn't so...

00:24:23.072 --> 00:24:23.612
What's the word?

00:24:23.752 --> 00:24:23.972
Huh?

00:24:25.093 --> 00:24:25.913
Intense.

00:24:26.153 --> 00:24:26.653
Intense?

00:24:26.713 --> 00:24:27.073
Intense?

00:24:27.173 --> 00:24:28.933
I was going to say fun, but walks are fun too.

00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:31.294
Walks are fun too.

00:24:31.354 --> 00:24:34.255
But we hope that you got some rare prizes and treasures.

00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:34.595
Yeah.

00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:40.316
You know, and hopefully you're able to stay cool despite the really intense Japanese summer.

00:24:40.636 --> 00:24:41.676
Yeah.

00:24:41.937 --> 00:24:44.537
But to be honest, I'm a little bit envious.

00:24:45.577 --> 00:24:46.698
We want to go too!

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:53.832
And you know we saw on Twitter, we saw that there's some FUWAMOCO fanworks on sale too!

00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:54.853
Why?

00:24:54.873 --> 00:24:54.933
Why?

00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:55.854
Too fast!

00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:56.454
Ruffians!

00:24:56.514 --> 00:24:57.015
How?

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.175
You're amazing.

00:24:58.195 --> 00:24:59.496
Too fast.

00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:03.979
You know, and there's even a Mococo cosplayer.

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:04.459
Right!

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.421
Oh Moco-chan!

00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:09.223
It's happening!

00:25:09.243 --> 00:25:11.044
Too amazing!

00:25:11.084 --> 00:25:12.825
We're so so impressed.

00:25:12.905 --> 00:25:14.046
Thank you Ruffians!

00:25:14.585 --> 00:25:20.092
We hope you had a lot of fun and that you also got a lot of goodies to go home with too.

00:25:20.232 --> 00:25:20.993
Thank you!

00:25:21.274 --> 00:25:23.737
We're glad you had a good walk at Comiket.

00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:24.418
A good battle.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.861
And for our next segment, we have... Question of the Day!

00:25:32.242 --> 00:25:33.222
What's the question today?

00:25:33.422 --> 00:25:33.922
De-den!

00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:36.023
Hashtag helpFWMC.

00:25:36.043 --> 00:25:38.264
That's what you want to use if you have a question.

00:25:38.284 --> 00:25:41.285
Do you girls go to the same class or separate class in school?

00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:44.105
Tell us what the experience is like.

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:48.867
Have Fuwa-chan and Moco-chan got wrongly recognized by their friends?

00:25:48.887 --> 00:25:49.587
Good question.

00:25:49.627 --> 00:25:52.108
It's a good question.

00:25:52.128 --> 00:25:54.709
Wow, you know we're in the South for a long time, so...

00:25:55.618 --> 00:26:04.001
Oh, we had to kind of go back a bit, but... I guess when we were in guard dog training, sometimes we were in the same class, but sometimes we were separate, you know?

00:26:04.342 --> 00:26:05.282
Sometimes it's just like that.

00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:05.642
Yeah.

00:26:06.102 --> 00:26:17.567
I think both were good and fun, good experiences, but being in the same class is more convenient because then, you know, we can keep track of any tasks or tests coming up and just study together, you know?

00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:19.348
Yeah, you know?

00:26:19.428 --> 00:26:22.369
Moco-chan, you're really good at taking notes.

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:23.009
My notes are cute.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.532
I can look at your notes.

00:26:25.552 --> 00:26:26.493
You don't need to take them.

00:26:26.533 --> 00:26:30.997
But then sometimes we end up fighting over them too, and that's not good.

00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:39.506
But you know, even when we're in separate classes, sometimes, even if the teacher didn't know that we were twins, they will remember us.

00:26:39.787 --> 00:26:40.688
They don't need to remember us.

00:26:40.708 --> 00:26:42.309
You know, sometimes you just sort of want to be...

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.410
Quiet.

00:26:44.952 --> 00:26:48.155
Just ignore me, don't notice me teacher, please.

00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:48.756
Thank you.

00:26:49.036 --> 00:26:51.979
Just sneak in, learn, and go.

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:55.702
Maybe we're just a bit too smiley.

00:26:56.663 --> 00:27:04.851
But as for getting wrongly recognized by friends, sometimes when people meet us for the first time,

00:27:05.553 --> 00:27:07.275
Maybe at first you couldn't tell.

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:21.733
I'm Fuwawa, what makes me Fuwawa, and what makes Moco-chan Moco-chan.

00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:23.554
But you know now, right?

00:27:23.594 --> 00:27:24.355
You know now, right?

00:27:24.535 --> 00:27:25.716
Of course, of course, right?

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:26.056
Yup!

00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:27.357
Right, dot dot dot.

00:27:28.258 --> 00:27:29.219
Yes, yes.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.761
You can tell, dot dot dot.

00:27:31.781 --> 00:27:33.702
There's some differences.

00:27:33.762 --> 00:27:34.143
Right?

00:27:34.263 --> 00:27:39.007
Like I have long hair, Moco-chan has short hair, you know?

00:27:39.387 --> 00:27:40.748
You know the difference though, right?

00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:41.509
Yup.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.962
Thank you for the questions!

00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:46.462
Very good questions.

00:27:46.702 --> 00:27:46.962
BAU BAU!

00:27:47.002 --> 00:27:47.743
Thank you!

00:27:47.783 --> 00:27:49.303
BAU BAU!

00:27:49.343 --> 00:27:52.364
Let's take a look at our next stream.

00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:56.606
Our next stream is... De-den!

00:27:56.926 --> 00:28:00.687
We have a super chat meeting, but you know...

00:28:01.548 --> 00:28:03.810
It's not just Super Chat reading, you know?

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:14.439
This is actually, we're gonna be reading all the Super Chats that you sent us, especially for our monetization celebration.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:17.802
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:28:17.842 --> 00:28:21.645
Yeah, you know we really wanted to be able to properly thank everyone.

00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:22.546
Yeah, you know?

00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:29.217
We really wanted to, but we're sorry that we made you wait a little bit.

00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:30.760
Yeah, it's been a bit.

00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:33.927
But finally, today we'll be able to say a proper thank you to you.

00:28:35.205 --> 00:28:35.786
Again with that.

00:28:36.827 --> 00:28:38.729
Today!

00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:44.134
But we'll also be including a Super Chat Readings for FUWAMOCO Morning Episode 3.

00:28:44.215 --> 00:28:44.935
Episode 3.

00:28:45.075 --> 00:28:47.898
For Spooky Jump Scare Mansion No.n 2!

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:52.844
And then also for our Overwatch 2 collab with Bijou.

00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:54.786
Yeah, and today's FUWAMOCO Morning 2.

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:55.466
As well.

00:28:56.207 --> 00:29:00.950
We hope that you'll join us as we chat and we also say our thanks.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.672
Our thanks for all your support too.

00:29:04.112 --> 00:29:10.536
But going forward, FUWAMOCO Morning will be also included in the Super Chat Reading at the end of the day.

00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:11.877
You know, the end of the stream.

00:29:13.277 --> 00:29:17.620
So please join us for the evening stream too, okay?

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.521
We're gonna have a lot of chatting.

00:29:20.262 --> 00:29:22.683
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:29:22.703 --> 00:29:24.464
It's been a lot of fun today, okay?

00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:29.066
Next, let's take a peek at our schedule.

00:29:29.086 --> 00:29:34.027
This week, it's even more busy than the last.

00:29:34.688 --> 00:29:36.208
Is that even possible?

00:29:36.228 --> 00:29:37.909
I don't know.

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:42.270
But we have a lot of fun things planned.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.971
This week too, just in time for the Oboe Holiday in Japan,

00:29:46.807 --> 00:29:49.750
We're going to be staying up really late in the Northwest passes.

00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:54.035
And we're going to be doing a Japanese chatting stream while taking some questions too!

00:29:54.876 --> 00:30:01.884
I know we did a Q&A earlier, but this time we're going to be doing it in Japanese.

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:05.206
On the 16th, we'll be doing a Japanese chat stream!

00:30:05.286 --> 00:30:08.866
It's our first time, so we'd be happy if you could join us.

00:30:08.986 --> 00:30:09.827
I'm a little nervous.

00:30:09.847 --> 00:30:13.187
The time will be a little different from FUWAMOCO.

00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:14.108
We'll be starting at 5pm.

00:30:14.128 --> 00:30:14.788
A little later than that.

00:30:14.828 --> 00:30:18.069
We'll also be accepting questions, so please ask us a lot of questions.

00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:33.879
If you use H-E-L-P or F-W-M-C, it will help a lot.

00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:38.383
Also, if you listen to us as soon as possible, we might be able to answer your questions.

00:30:38.644 --> 00:30:40.926
Please listen to us as soon as possible!

00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:46.070
We want to get to know more and more Japanese Ruffians.

00:30:55.459 --> 00:30:58.983
We'll also do our best to translate the questions that we get asked into English.

00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:03.788
So maybe, you know, Ruffians that are still learning Japanese, we hope you can join.

00:31:04.248 --> 00:31:07.351
And maybe it'll be less scary too.

00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:09.674
Yeah, maybe it can help your learning.

00:31:10.254 --> 00:31:11.716
Please join us!

00:31:12.056 --> 00:31:13.037
But if it's really, really...

00:31:14.278 --> 00:31:14.718
Thank you!

00:31:14.778 --> 00:31:18.359
And then on Saturday, we'll be playing Zelda Ocarina of Time!

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:19.779
We're really really excited.

00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:36.966
Good memories again.

00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:38.846
It stands out to us a lot.

00:31:39.107 --> 00:31:43.449
And I think, you know, we did beat it once with Mama Puppy at one point.

00:31:44.209 --> 00:31:49.731
Yeah, I think maybe this is a link to the past, but those are probably the only games we beat.

00:31:49.771 --> 00:31:53.213
But you know, we're gonna be playing it not on Switch.

00:31:53.253 --> 00:31:55.174
We're gonna be playing it on N64.

00:31:55.574 --> 00:31:57.115
I wonder if we still have the save data.

00:31:59.011 --> 00:32:01.153
When we beat it.

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:01.994
Probably not.

00:32:02.134 --> 00:32:03.675
It's probably been cleared since then.

00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:08.159
That would be sad, but... We have to make new save data, you know it.

00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:08.760
I know.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:19.209
We've had so many special memories with MAMOPUFFY, but now we're gonna be able to have special memories together with the Ruffians playing it, so we're really looking forward to it.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.352
Let's make lots of precious memories together, okay?

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:27.360
Well, the time has come, Moco-chan.

00:32:28.201 --> 00:32:28.741
So fast.

00:32:29.061 --> 00:32:32.304
Another end to a FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:32.504 --> 00:32:43.151
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to say a special shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.

00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:43.611
Hattori!

00:32:44.272 --> 00:32:44.652

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.051

00:33:03.673 --> 00:33:04.013
Take?

00:33:04.293 --> 00:33:04.513
Take?

00:33:05.513 --> 00:33:07.514
BAU BAU!

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:12.495
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:33:12.655 --> 00:33:13.635
Howl of a day!

00:33:13.655 --> 00:33:16.116
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:17.138 --> 00:33:17.759
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!
