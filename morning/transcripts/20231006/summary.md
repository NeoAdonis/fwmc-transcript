Tune in for a [special 3D Collab](https://twitter.com/hololive_En/status/1701430450273837276) featuring [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/@IRyS) joined by Hololive EN -Council-. 2023-10-07T19:00Z

## Celebration: 100 live streams (10:50)

Numbers don't lie: FUWAMOCO is celebrating 100 live streams on YouTube!

## Misunderstanding (13:05)

During their last [Resident Evil 4 stream](https://youtu.be/nrMfq4OknXU), FUWAMOCO seemed determined to commit violence against some scary grandmas and grandpas. Of course, they advise against doing so in real life! Respect your elders.

## Secret (15:30)

Mococo shares that even when the heat is up, her toes feel constantly cold and when possible she uses a foot warmer.

## Guerilla Stream (19:42)

It seems that one Suika Game stream wasn't enough for the twins, so they'll be hosting another unscheduled one! 2023-10-07T00:00Z

## Doggie of the Day (21:57)

[Loudas](https://twitter.com/loudas1999/status/1709884778588037384) shows Ruffians a pic of their fluffy companion. With no name given, FUWAMOCO decide to name it Floren√ßa, then Foofa.

## Today I Went On A Walk (24:47)

[@splinteredpizza](https://twitter.com/splinteredpizza/status/1709665980157133278) takes a walk up late in the evening. FUWAMOCO seem concerned about this Ruffian's safety.

## Question Of The Day (26:29)

[Wushsuh](https://twitter.com/WuhsuhBen/status/1709635468134871321) is curious about FUWAMOCO's figure collection. The sisters confess that they haven't collected new ones in a while. They recall that they were less expensive back in the day and now they take longer to arrive after they are just first announced.
