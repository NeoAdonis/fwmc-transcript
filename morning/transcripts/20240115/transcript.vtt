00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:16.825
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.572
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:24.356
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:24.937
BAU BAU!

00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:29.921
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.702 --> 00:05:33.044
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:36.087
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:36.848
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:43.132
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.133
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:51.817
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 68th episode!

00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:55.771
That's a lot of episodes!

00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:59.997
I feel like just a few weeks ago we were, oh, it's episode 36.

00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:00.618
Right?

00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:02.280
It just kind of hit me today.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.941
Wow.

00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:03.983
68 episodes.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:05.605
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:07.067
Thank you!

00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:07.528
BAU BAU!

00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:15.434
Well, for Ruffians that may be, today's your first FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:22.138
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:24.079
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.720
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:33.987
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:34.248 --> 00:06:39.313
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:43.477
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:45.139
BAU BAU!

00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.142
You missed us!

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:51.144
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.506
Hasn't been that long though.

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:54.587
Has it?

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:56.528
I definitely did.

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:01.793
Moco-chan.

00:07:02.594 --> 00:07:03.434
Ruffians.

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:05.596
Did you notice anything strange?

00:07:08.058 --> 00:07:11.321
There's been some bad news.

00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:13.483
There's been!

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:16.604
Another Pero Sighting.

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:21.750
Well, let's hear where he was spotted today.

00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:24.273
De-den!

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:28.918
The Pero's become hot chocolate!

00:07:31.977 --> 00:07:35.058
I don't know, that's actually pretty fitting, no?

00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:37.139
He looks great here!

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.959
Pretty nice.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.880
Actually, pretty delicious even.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.241
That's pretty amazing!

00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:43.781
Appetizing!

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.182
Yeah, that's amazing for a nasty guy like him.

00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:48.562
You know, I like how his sweater looks a bit sleepy.

00:07:50.183 --> 00:07:52.944
It must be because, you know, he's all warm and toasty.

00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:53.864
Nice!

00:07:53.884 --> 00:07:55.565
It's like a big bath.

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:57.605
I'm a bit envious.

00:07:59.006 --> 00:07:59.446
But you know,

00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:01.235
FUWAMOCO

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:14.003
Why haven't I been made into a Mococo yet, Ruffians?

00:08:14.903 --> 00:08:17.164
I wanna be warm and toasty too, okay?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.304
Warm milk, nice mug.

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:21.045
Sounds pretty good.

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:24.685
I just wanna be a warm cup of Mococo.

00:08:25.646 --> 00:08:26.546
I wanna be warm!

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:27.606
Yeah!

00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:33.027
Well, you know, it's definitely the season for some comfy, warm drinks.

00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:34.968
It's cold, right, Ruffians?

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:37.389
Careful what you ask for, Mococo.

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:39.872
What?

00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:42.034
Moco-chan just wants to be a warm drink.

00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:44.116
I didn't want to warm you up!

00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:44.456
Okay.

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:47.539
Well, we hope you enjoyed your, uh...

00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:52.306
Pero, even though he deflated a little bit.

00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:53.026
That's okay.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.207
That's okay, yeah.

00:08:54.507 --> 00:08:56.667
He still looks like he was delicious!

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:58.348
And that's what's important, right.

00:08:58.968 --> 00:09:00.048
But, Ruffians!

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:02.889
What do you think of a FUWAMOCO cafe, huh?

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.429
Cafe, huh?

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.050
FUWAMOCO cafe.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.831
Yeah, you have your, uh, your FUWAMORNING!

00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:12.032
Topped with a moco chest.

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.813
And a FUWAMOCO loco moco.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:15.013
Right.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:18.037
BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:19.818
BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:40.830
Lots of ideas!

00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.712
Fuwa latte!

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:44.233
Fuwa water!

00:09:44.273 --> 00:09:45.694
Fuwa waffles!

00:09:45.754 --> 00:09:47.035
Fuwa watame!

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:48.596
Right!

00:09:48.876 --> 00:09:49.997
That's a thought.

00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:50.878
You think that?

00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:52.539
Yeah.

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:54.520
The cafe attendants would be cute.

00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:58.483
Well, they have to wear ears and tail too, right?

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:00.925
They have to say BAU BAU, right?

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:02.526
Otherwise they're fired!

00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:04.588
I like talking over ice, but... Oh!

00:10:04.988 --> 00:10:05.389
Oh, us?

00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:06.550
Oh, we work at the cafe?

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.950
Yeah.

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:09.749
BAU BAU!

00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:12.491
BAU BAU!

00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:14.071
We're not gonna fire ourselves.

00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:14.612
No!

00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:15.692
BAU BAU!

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:17.573
BAU BAU!

00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:19.454
Ruffians!

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:22.896
There's been another milestone!

00:10:23.636 --> 00:10:24.837
No misunderstanding!

00:10:25.097 --> 00:10:26.738
Another milestone!

00:10:26.838 --> 00:10:29.359
It started with an M, but it's different.

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:30.259
This one's happy.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.240
Yeah.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.740
Wow.

00:10:34.612 --> 00:10:40.576
Our cover of Kanaya's Identity has hit 500,000 views!

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:42.738
BAU BAU BAU!

00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:44.879
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:47.401
BAU BAU!

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.482
Wow!

00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:50.243
Wow!

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.924
Wow!

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:54.305
Wow!

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:55.206
Wow!

00:10:55.226 --> 00:10:57.227
Mocobaby appears.

00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:58.408
That was what you just said.

00:10:58.488 --> 00:10:58.668
Wow!

00:10:58.688 --> 00:10:58.808
Wow!

00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:01.070
That's what the Ruffians said.

00:11:03.508 --> 00:11:15.318
Ruffians, you know, it makes us really happy to think that our singing has been able to reach so many.

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:22.504
You know, hopefully, maybe in the process, it's made a few new Ruffians too.

00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:27.729
You know, we know it's just a cover song, but we feel really happy and hope that, you know,

00:11:28.249 --> 00:11:31.932
In the future, maybe our original music can do the same too!

00:11:33.213 --> 00:11:35.735
We'll continue to sing loud tonight!

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:37.776
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:41.218
BAU BAU!

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.240
Very exciting.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.584
But also, on the topic of music, Ruffians!

00:11:49.404 --> 00:11:55.749
You haven't forgotten about the new hololive English cover song, right?

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:13.595
Well, Bae-senpai has worked very hard to organize a huge project with every member of hololive English to cover the song Mindcraft. Not Minecraft, Mindcraft. Yeah, not the game, Mindcraft.

00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:16.664
But you know what?

00:12:16.924 --> 00:12:27.813
It was originally set to release at the beginning of the month, but now it will be releasing on January 20th at 7pm PT or 12 noon JST on the 21st.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.255
Excited!

00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:33.498
I'm really excited for you, Shiori.

00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:36.061
It's very colorful, very emotional.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.284
You know, and we're just so thankful to Bae-senpai for including us in Advent too!

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:50.689
You know, we kind of talk about how FUWAMOCO, we still just kind of feel like... Somehow we're here!

00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:51.409
Somehow!

00:12:51.429 --> 00:12:53.291
We're still here!

00:12:53.391 --> 00:12:57.854
Yeah, but Minecraft, you know, it kind of makes us feel like, oh!

00:12:58.374 --> 00:12:59.855
We're in hololive now!

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:02.757
So, it really means a lot to us.

00:13:03.357 --> 00:13:05.558
Thank you very much!

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:08.040
Please look forward to it, okay, Ruffians?

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.802
Yeah, five days, six... Five days, six days.

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:12.242
Like, what day is it?

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:13.964
You'll blink and it'll be here, Ruffians.

00:13:14.004 --> 00:13:16.005
Yeah, sleep a bit, it'll be here.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:16.545
Alright.

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:16.825
Okay.

00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:19.367
I know maybe joining FUWAMOCO for some fun times.

00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:19.847
Yeah!

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:20.908
It'll be here.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:21.728
Okay.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.130
BAU BAU!

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.091
I'm so excited for you.

00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:28.752
I hope we can do more songs altogether.

00:13:28.832 --> 00:13:30.353
Right, I hope so.

00:13:31.807 --> 00:13:35.669
There's a lot of work that goes into coordinating something like that.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.231
Please look forward to it.

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.172
Ruffians, we sure are.

00:13:40.992 --> 00:13:43.273
I have a bit of a quiz for you, okay?

00:13:43.293 --> 00:13:44.214
Ruffians.

00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:50.737
Do you know who these are?

00:13:51.217 --> 00:13:54.999
Do you know?

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.361
You know who these are, right?

00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:00.741
Yeah!

00:14:01.122 --> 00:14:03.022
That's you, Ruffian!

00:14:03.062 --> 00:14:05.103
It's you, it's you!

00:14:05.143 --> 00:14:06.224
Ruffian!

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:08.045
Aren't you cute?

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:11.066
Very fluffy, very fuzzy, right?

00:14:11.386 --> 00:14:13.467
A perfect size for hugging, huh?

00:14:13.547 --> 00:14:14.868
For hugging.

00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:19.430
Yeah, but you know there's a blue one and a pink one.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.251
But they're both equally Ruffians.

00:14:22.471 --> 00:14:25.633
You know there's a blue Ruffian and a pink Ruffian.

00:14:26.193 --> 00:14:27.114
They have no names.

00:14:28.394 --> 00:14:29.835
It's just describing the colors.

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:31.777
In case you couldn't tell, okay?

00:14:32.477 --> 00:14:33.218
Pretty cool.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.699
I think so too.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.380
That's you!

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.261
That's you, yes!

00:14:37.281 --> 00:14:38.922
Ruffian fuzzy, well that's the thing.

00:14:39.422 --> 00:14:41.864
Equally Ruffians, you know?

00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:44.506
There are no Ruffians, no fuzzians.

00:14:45.086 --> 00:14:46.147
Just Ruffians, okay?

00:14:46.207 --> 00:14:47.007
That's the thing.

00:14:47.107 --> 00:14:48.108
Just Ruffians.

00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:52.310
A Ruffian is a Ruffian is a Ruffian, okay?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.992
It isn't Mococo's Ruffian or Fuwawa's Ruffian.

00:14:57.132 --> 00:15:00.814
All Ruffians are both of our Ruffians, right?

00:15:00.854 --> 00:15:01.374
We're sharing.

00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:04.976
All Ruffians are both of our Ruffians, okay?

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:11.659
Cuz you know, just as we care about all of you, we want you to like and care about both of us too, okay?

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:12.660
You know...

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.901
I can love Moco-chan lots.

00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:18.181
Really?

00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:18.921
Yeah.

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:19.341
Really?

00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:27.623
It's kind of embarrassing saying these things early in the morning.

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:29.344
It's hard to say it right on.

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:34.325
I love Fuwawa lots too, of course, but... You can tell from my actions, okay?

00:15:34.345 --> 00:15:36.686
I don't need to say it because my actions say it.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:37.506
Okay, got it.

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:46.324
Ruffians, we really want you to like both of us too, you know?

00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:52.486
Taking sides and maybe putting one of us down, it makes both of us sad.

00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:56.187
And that's because we both love each other very much.

00:15:56.407 --> 00:15:58.528
And we hope that if you love one of us,

00:15:59.368 --> 00:15:59.668
BAU BAU!

00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:02.649
Pero is not a part of this, okay?

00:16:03.049 --> 00:16:04.370
We said both of us.

00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:27.577
No, pero.

00:16:28.077 --> 00:16:30.079
Okay.

00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:32.981
BAU BAU!

00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:35.603
There's a lot of confessions going on.

00:16:36.483 --> 00:16:37.184
Why?

00:16:37.944 --> 00:16:39.005
BAU BAU.

00:16:39.305 --> 00:16:42.308
This is not the confession corner, okay, Ruffians?

00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:42.388
No!

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.369
No confession today!

00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:46.031
Okay, okay.

00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:46.551
What?

00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:50.403
Well, Ruffians!

00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:52.985
We got a scoop from one of you!

00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:54.707
We got a scoop!

00:16:55.267 --> 00:16:56.228
Thank you!

00:16:56.608 --> 00:17:01.552
Thank you so much, Piotr, for the excellent journalism!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.534
Well, it seems like...

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:15.915
Biboo and Calli-senpai, they had a collab the other day where they got talking about some of the Japanese words and phrases that we've taught Biboo.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:20.296
And well, Calli-senpai!

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:24.537
Calli-senpai finally got to learn about my favorite Japanese word.

00:17:24.617 --> 00:17:26.538
Ruffians, you remember what it is, right?

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:35.900
Why are you making that face and not giving me the answer like I asked, huh?

00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:37.941
Otomari-kai.

00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:38.281
Otomari-kai.

00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:40.902
Otomari-kai.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.593
A bit different, a bit different.

00:18:07.813 --> 00:18:13.739
But, you know, Biboo then said the most recent phrase that we taught her in Japanese.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:20.587
But, Kaori-senpai immediately thought the worst.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.790
I mean, Biboo thinks that we tricked her again!

00:18:24.491 --> 00:18:26.333
Kaori-senpai!

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:27.053
Again?

00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:29.995
No!

00:18:30.435 --> 00:18:31.076
No!

00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:33.396
Are you doubting us?

00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:36.117
Don't misunderstand!

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:39.478
This nameru is not nameru like lick-nameru.

00:18:39.498 --> 00:18:43.039
It's nameru like underestimate.

00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:44.439
Two different meanings.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:47.040
We discussed this on FUWAMOCO Morning already.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.301
Two different meanings.

00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:50.961
Yeah, okay.

00:18:51.161 --> 00:18:55.463
What are you thinking things like that, huh?

00:18:56.183 --> 00:18:56.683
Huh?

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:04.031
I think, if anything Ruffians, Calli-senpai is the one to be questing here, okay?

00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:06.032
Yeah.

00:19:06.072 --> 00:19:06.292
Yeah.

00:19:06.672 --> 00:19:08.532
No fucking us on the nose, okay?

00:19:08.612 --> 00:19:09.032
No!

00:19:09.192 --> 00:19:10.493
We're innocent puppies!

00:19:10.513 --> 00:19:10.793
Yeah.

00:19:11.473 --> 00:19:12.053
No pain.

00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:12.573
No.

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:12.993
Okay?

00:19:14.094 --> 00:19:15.414
Accusing senpai?

00:19:17.474 --> 00:19:18.395
I'm gonna accuse.

00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:21.515
Yeah.

00:19:21.555 --> 00:19:24.296
BAU BAU!

00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:24.616
BAU BAU!

00:19:27.142 --> 00:19:29.864
I don't know, isn't that the role of a kouhai sometimes?

00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:30.745
Right?

00:19:30.785 --> 00:19:32.046
To accuse the senpai?

00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:35.429
Exactly, that's a normal role.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.591
Ruffians!

00:19:38.092 --> 00:19:46.619
We also wanted to share some extra special trivia with you today about FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.102
Extra special trivia!

00:19:50.262 --> 00:19:50.863
Because...

00:19:53.176 --> 00:19:59.443
You know, we have the Extra Special Ruffian that we call out at the end of every FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

00:19:59.463 --> 00:20:00.864
You know?

00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:07.072
Well, actually, it was Mama Puppy that gave us that idea.

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:18.323
You know, back when Mama Puppy was a wee little puppy herself, there was a TV show that she liked that used to do something similar.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:22.926
You know, she used to watch it almost every morning.

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:29.471
But she always thought it was so exciting and lovely, and she couldn't wait to get her name called out.

00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:33.414
But you know, of course, there's no comment section.

00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:37.818
So every day, she'd wait in hopes that Mama Puppy would be called.

00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:38.949
Yeah!

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:39.610
Yeah.

00:20:53.624 --> 00:20:55.245
That's the origins of it.

00:20:55.785 --> 00:20:58.886
You know, because we're live here with you.

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:00.326
I can see your names.

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:03.287
No matter how unique your name is, we can read it.

00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:04.647
We can read it, okay.

00:21:05.088 --> 00:21:10.549
Even if your name is... Momomountainlove65 or something.

00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:11.529
We can still read it.

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:12.710
We can still see it.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.310
Yeah, we can see your names.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.391
The Slayer.

00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:16.171
Wiggles.

00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:17.571
You know it.

00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:18.852
Yeah, we can read it.

00:21:18.872 --> 00:21:21.813
We hope that it can bring you savage foils.

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:29.158
Just as much happiness and excitement as you know it did for Mama Puppy when she was a little puppy.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:39.968
But you know, even if her name isn't called for a long time, please remember, Ruffians, that you're still extra special to us no matter what.

00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:41.069
We see you.

00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:41.750
We do.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:42.871
We see you.

00:21:43.131 --> 00:21:44.052
We do.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.473
We see you here.

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:47.315
We see you on Twitter.

00:21:47.455 --> 00:21:47.976
We see you.

00:21:48.736 --> 00:21:49.017
BAU BAU!

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:49.977
Ruffians!

00:21:49.997 --> 00:21:52.019
It's that time of the week!

00:22:14.008 --> 00:22:15.128
You've forgotten about it.

00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:20.789
It's time for Moco-chan to challenge herself to something new.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.370
And today, that's eating natto!

00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:27.491
It's been three weeks.

00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:32.312
It's been on a bit of a hiatus, but it's back!

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:34.952
I don't want to spill.

00:22:35.152 --> 00:22:36.893
I have a nice new outfit.

00:22:37.093 --> 00:22:37.613
You're not gonna spill.

00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:41.128
But Ruffians, you know what?

00:22:41.649 --> 00:22:46.072
If you challenge yourself to something new at the beginning of the week, you can do anything!

00:22:46.192 --> 00:22:47.193
Nothing is scary!

00:22:47.313 --> 00:22:51.317
Or at the beginning of the year, but I hope you challenge yourself more than just once this year.

00:22:51.357 --> 00:22:52.978
Can you not mix it up this time?

00:22:52.998 --> 00:22:53.899
No, I'm gonna mix it up!

00:22:54.399 --> 00:22:55.781
But Ruffians, you can do!

00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.623
You can do anything if you apply yourself to it.

00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:07.572
That's why Moco-chan is going to show you that you can eat natto.

00:23:07.592 --> 00:23:11.434
The last couple times you did pretty well Moco-chan.

00:23:11.715 --> 00:23:15.657
Moco-chan ate a good amount of natto thanks to the sesame oil, right?

00:23:16.297 --> 00:23:18.819
So, I believe in you today too, Moco-chan.

00:23:18.859 --> 00:23:19.539
You can do it!

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:25.864
For any Ruffians that maybe don't know what natto is, natto is a Japanese breakfast food.

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:32.168
It's fermented soybeans, and it's pretty sticky and slimy, a little bit smelly.

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:34.650
But it's really, really good for you.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.032
And Moco-chan, you do want to eat this eventually.

00:23:37.052 --> 00:23:38.213
I do want to eat it.

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:42.596
That's why I'm challenging it, because I feel like there is value to eating it.

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:44.557
But I want to be able to eat it.

00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:45.378
And eat it.

00:23:46.118 --> 00:23:47.860
Happily ever after.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.120
Okay.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.981
So, baby steps.

00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:51.322
You can do it, Moco-chan.

00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:52.583
See, Moco-chan?

00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:53.524
Yeah.

00:23:53.544 --> 00:23:57.347
That's why I'm challenging you, because I want to do it!

00:23:57.427 --> 00:23:57.788
Yeah.

00:23:57.948 --> 00:24:10.638
And Moco-chan, you know, she's going to conquer her dislike for natto, so you know, hopefully, you can continue to protect the Ruffian smiles for many, many years to come, just like Fuwawa, right?

00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:12.199
Because I ate my natto.

00:24:14.933 --> 00:24:16.153
I'm mixing it up.

00:24:16.213 --> 00:24:17.914
Oh, it's very sticky today.

00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:24.676
Ruffians, we have the sesame oil on standby.

00:24:25.076 --> 00:24:26.757
But Moco-chan said that she'd try it.

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:27.637
I don't have it.

00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:28.577
Oh, I do have a tissue.

00:24:28.597 --> 00:24:29.497
Just like normal.

00:24:30.738 --> 00:24:34.619
And then we'll see if we need the sesame oil to make an appearance.

00:24:35.509 --> 00:24:37.650
FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.311
Do you think you're ready?

00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:40.712
Are you confident?

00:24:40.732 --> 00:24:41.712
It's been three weeks.

00:24:42.413 --> 00:24:43.874
I'm confident for you.

00:24:44.434 --> 00:24:47.976
Okay well, Moco-chan.

00:24:48.376 --> 00:24:53.199
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Tochigi who worked very hard to make this.

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:54.980
Thank you.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.942
I appreciate your farming.

00:24:57.962 --> 00:25:00.343
I appreciate the farming.

00:25:01.344 --> 00:25:03.125
Okay, Moco-chan!

00:25:03.285 --> 00:25:04.066
Oh gosh.

00:25:04.406 --> 00:25:05.607
It's very sticky today, huh?

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:07.588
It's really sticky.

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:09.149
Hai!

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:13.592
Itadakimasu!

00:25:13.993 --> 00:25:14.313
Mada.

00:25:14.353 --> 00:25:14.853
Mada?

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.575
Why is it so sticky?

00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:18.916
It's very sticky, huh?

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.181
Oh, what?

00:25:30.481 --> 00:25:31.502
It's too sticky.

00:25:32.282 --> 00:25:32.902
Too sticky.

00:25:33.382 --> 00:25:35.903
Yeah, it's making me... Making me what?

00:25:36.223 --> 00:25:36.824
Confused.

00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:41.645
Extra sticky today.

00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:46.847
And the beans have a bit of a... A darker color?

00:25:46.867 --> 00:25:47.207
Yeah.

00:25:48.168 --> 00:25:48.808
I don't know why.

00:25:48.828 --> 00:25:50.408
These are still good, right?

00:25:50.628 --> 00:25:51.069
They're good!

00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:51.589
They're good!

00:25:55.264 --> 00:25:55.824
Okay.

00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:59.006
Here, Moco-chan has one bean.

00:25:59.026 --> 00:26:01.767
Are you sure there's not a white spot on them?

00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:04.089
That's the natto bean, extra good for you.

00:26:04.109 --> 00:26:07.831
Okay!

00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:13.875
No, just pinch your nose.

00:26:13.975 --> 00:26:14.175
Okay.

00:26:14.275 --> 00:26:14.955
Okay.

00:26:22.543 --> 00:26:23.104
Okay.

00:26:23.824 --> 00:26:24.605
Okay!

00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:25.726
I'm concerned.

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:28.108
It's good, it's extra good for you.

00:26:28.908 --> 00:26:30.950
Okay, here goes Moco-chan!

00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:35.954
It was almost on the tongue and then it wasn't.

00:26:38.436 --> 00:26:40.979
I feel like I may be doing better though.

00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:42.920
Oh, are you?

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.202
It went in my mouth and then it went out.

00:26:46.904 --> 00:26:48.285
That's apparently better.

00:26:48.525 --> 00:26:49.606
What is... Oh!

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:53.350
Almost there.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.990
Oh, oh!

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:55.911
It's left the chopsticks!

00:26:56.631 --> 00:26:57.651
It's left the chopsticks!

00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:01.952
Pokemoco-chan, you're making too big of a deal out of this.

00:27:02.032 --> 00:27:08.774
Oh, they just... Just let it out.

00:27:10.054 --> 00:27:21.437
Just eat it and scream it out.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:24.382
Huh?

00:27:25.023 --> 00:27:25.243
Huh?

00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:26.204
You swallowed it?

00:27:26.424 --> 00:27:27.004
Did you chew it?

00:27:27.165 --> 00:27:27.385
No?

00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:27.905
No?

00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:28.366
No?

00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:28.666
Ah.

00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:29.607
Thank you.

00:27:30.427 --> 00:27:30.808
One bean?

00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:31.608
One bean?

00:27:34.271 --> 00:27:35.391
Ways different today.

00:27:35.992 --> 00:27:36.632
In a good way.

00:27:38.554 --> 00:27:39.014
I don't know.

00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:41.757
She did it!

00:27:42.678 --> 00:27:43.939
One bean straight.

00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:45.039
Straight natto.

00:27:46.272 --> 00:27:46.772
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:27:46.812 --> 00:27:47.893
No, no, no, no, no.

00:27:47.913 --> 00:27:48.653
You have to do another one.

00:27:48.673 --> 00:27:48.993
No, I'm good.

00:27:49.053 --> 00:27:49.594
I'm good.

00:27:49.674 --> 00:27:51.174
No, you can't just put a paw there.

00:27:51.194 --> 00:27:52.015
No, I'm good for now.

00:27:52.075 --> 00:27:52.515
Thank you.

00:27:53.095 --> 00:27:54.076
One more!

00:27:54.236 --> 00:27:55.036
One more!

00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:55.877
No, no.

00:27:56.277 --> 00:27:57.097
Look!

00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:57.597
No.

00:27:57.738 --> 00:27:58.198
Look!

00:27:58.498 --> 00:27:59.698
One more, Moco-chan.

00:27:59.718 --> 00:27:59.758
No.

00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:01.399
Why?

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:02.520
It tastes different today.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.061
Yeah, that's a good thing.

00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:08.483
We believe in you.

00:28:08.623 --> 00:28:09.703
I know what it's supposed to be.

00:28:09.723 --> 00:28:10.824
One more bean, Moco-chan.

00:28:11.164 --> 00:28:11.424
No.

00:28:11.684 --> 00:28:13.585
One more bean for Poruru-oneechan.

00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:14.545
Not this time.

00:28:14.606 --> 00:28:15.066
Next week.

00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:20.578
Next week!

00:28:21.278 --> 00:28:23.039
I'll have the encore bean then.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.061
Oh, this is so sticky!

00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:26.922
Why?

00:28:27.162 --> 00:28:29.583
I'm trying to pick one bean, but look, I have three!

00:28:29.603 --> 00:28:31.524
Three encores!

00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:33.085
Triple encore!

00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:39.429
They're really good today.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.610
They taste different.

00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:45.712
Like, uh... BAU BAU!

00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:46.253
Darker.

00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:50.762
BAU BAU!

00:28:50.782 --> 00:28:55.325
Ruffians!

00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:58.268
You should try some natto too, okay?

00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:05.053
Don't forget to challenge yourself to something new this week too, okay?

00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:07.555
Even if you took a three week hiatus, it's okay.

00:29:07.575 --> 00:29:09.777
Even if you did, you don't know why.

00:29:10.362 --> 00:29:11.142
Just try again.

00:29:11.663 --> 00:29:16.584
And I'm looking forward to eating Moco-chan's leftovers today too!

00:29:16.604 --> 00:29:18.965
BAU BAU!

00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:22.287
These are good.

00:29:22.687 --> 00:29:23.967
Why is it so good today, huh?

00:29:24.007 --> 00:29:24.287
No.

00:29:25.808 --> 00:29:28.329
And today's Doggie of the Day!

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:31.630
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.731
Shi!

00:29:33.251 --> 00:29:36.172
Shi as in sushi!

00:29:36.812 --> 00:29:38.053
It's so cute!

00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:46.621
This is a dog you found at the bar.

00:29:48.421 --> 00:29:53.363
So you go to the bar to meet cute dogs, huh?

00:29:54.923 --> 00:30:01.986
But, you know, this Ruffian says that she is the second ruffiest dog they've seen in their life.

00:30:03.086 --> 00:30:04.126
Right?

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:05.207
That's pretty kind.

00:30:05.247 --> 00:30:08.388
You didn't forget about us, huh?

00:30:12.028 --> 00:30:13.950
So, you pet her.

00:30:15.571 --> 00:30:18.094
How does she BAU BAU?

00:30:18.514 --> 00:30:19.996
How does she BAU BAU?

00:30:21.497 --> 00:30:21.757
She.

00:30:22.138 --> 00:30:24.500
You know like a... BAU BAU!

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.381
BAU BAU!

00:30:25.821 --> 00:30:26.682
BAU BAU!

00:30:26.982 --> 00:30:28.184
BAU BAU!

00:30:34.648 --> 00:30:37.290
That's probably... Seductive BAU BAU!

00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:43.594
The second fluffiest dog at the bar.

00:30:43.874 --> 00:30:45.095
BAU BAU!

00:30:47.276 --> 00:30:48.017
Cute dog.

00:30:48.177 --> 00:30:52.980
Yeah, she is the kind of fluffy dog you find at the bar.

00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:59.063
I guess she just lets anyone pet her, huh?

00:30:59.264 --> 00:30:59.944
She's cute!

00:30:59.984 --> 00:31:01.205
She's a cute dog!

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:02.446
Very fluffy!

00:31:03.869 --> 00:31:07.633
BAU BAU!

00:31:07.693 --> 00:31:09.535
For today I went on a walk!

00:31:12.138 --> 00:31:14.720
We have...

00:31:19.517 --> 00:31:21.078
De-den!

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:24.841
Oh, cute!

00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:29.085
Those are some pretty dainty paw prints you found in your room there.

00:31:29.105 --> 00:31:30.125
I like that.

00:31:30.506 --> 00:31:32.287
Were they imprinted on the sidewalk?

00:31:32.347 --> 00:31:34.249
Let's live forever and ever and ever.

00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:35.690
Wait, are those in the sand?

00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:39.439
Doesn't matter, I love it.

00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:46.625
About FUWAMOCO's puppets, they're a little bit different compared to this.

00:31:47.285 --> 00:31:52.829
But, well, maybe you'll find out one day.

00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:54.110
It's a secret for now.

00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:58.013
BAU BAU!

00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:01.236
And for our Question of the Day, we have

00:32:01.806 --> 00:32:03.127
De-den!

00:32:03.607 --> 00:32:05.309
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

00:32:05.429 --> 00:32:09.632
How long does it usually take to prepare an episode of FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:32:10.672 --> 00:32:12.874
This is a really good question!

00:32:13.614 --> 00:32:15.416
We've mentioned it a little bit before.

00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:16.857
I think a while ago?

00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:18.318
Yeah, probably a while ago.

00:32:18.618 --> 00:32:22.521
But it actually takes us quite a while to prepare everything.

00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:35.838
You know, there's a lot of work that you don't see, and, well, we don't really want you to see it either, you know, but, generally every day before FUWAMOCO Morning, we're up about three hours beforehand, you know, preparing, getting ready.

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:43.944
You know, it's also because it's proven that it takes your voice around three hours to fully wake up, too, but it takes us a while to prepare.

00:32:44.624 --> 00:32:54.028
Yeah, if we kind of decide to rush, at the very least, it takes us around two hours to get everything done in time.

00:32:55.049 --> 00:33:03.272
But, you know, we're constantly always trying to find new ways to make FUWAMOCO Morning more sustainable and a little bit easier on us.

00:33:03.692 --> 00:33:06.113
But this is how it is for now.

00:33:06.253 --> 00:33:07.674
I think it's gotten a bit better, too.

00:33:07.734 --> 00:33:09.555
Yeah, I think it's gotten a bit better.

00:33:10.596 --> 00:33:17.762
No matter how much of a commitment it is to us, it's really worth it to be able to see you off in the morning like this.

00:33:17.922 --> 00:33:23.186
Hopefully, you know, we're able to help you start off your day on the right paw.

00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:23.627
Exactly.

00:33:23.647 --> 00:33:24.568
So, Ruffians,

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.910
Thank you.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.731
Thank you for being here.

00:33:28.771 --> 00:33:30.692
Yeah, for starting your day with us!

00:33:31.993 --> 00:33:33.935
BAU BAU!

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.157
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:33:36.177 --> 00:33:37.157
Thank you!

00:33:37.197 --> 00:33:39.379
Thank you every single day.

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:46.525
And also, thank you for your submissions, your scoops, your FUWAMOCO scoops, your wonderful questions,

00:33:47.285 --> 00:33:48.566
Pero Sighting.

00:33:48.606 --> 00:33:50.628
Doggie of the Day.

00:33:50.708 --> 00:33:52.510
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:59.056
Let's continue to make FUWAMOCO Morning the warm place it is that we can share everything with.

00:33:59.076 --> 00:34:02.059
BAU BAU!

00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:04.681
Well, for our next theme,

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:07.609
We have de-den!

00:34:08.049 --> 00:34:11.192
Tonight we're playing Escalator.

00:34:11.473 --> 00:34:14.576
Yeah, it seems like it's kind of similar to the Exit.

00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:19.701
It seems like we need to escape the escalator.

00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:22.424
That's how I feel normally.

00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:24.526
Ruffians, please join us because...

00:34:26.548 --> 00:34:30.033
You know, Escalade is a little bit spooky to us, too.

00:34:30.553 --> 00:34:36.080
Lots of teeth, tails, stuff to get caught.

00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:41.567
Yeah, not very gentle, so... Please join us, okay?

00:34:42.408 --> 00:34:43.929
BAU BAU!

00:35:02.957 --> 00:35:07.358
And for FUWAMOCO, it'll be our first time watching Kanon 2006.

00:35:07.558 --> 00:35:10.799
We did watch the Kanon 2002 a long time ago.

00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:12.859
That was a long time ago though.

00:35:12.899 --> 00:35:15.560
So, you know, it's gonna be kind of fresh for us.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.520
Especially because we haven't seen Kanon 2006.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.181
And we can't remember anymore.

00:35:19.301 --> 00:35:23.462
So, you know, we hope that we can experience it all together!

00:35:24.062 --> 00:35:24.582
BAU BAU!

00:35:27.816 --> 00:35:29.897
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:35:30.357 --> 00:35:35.298
Thank you for joining us today for another episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:42.160
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
