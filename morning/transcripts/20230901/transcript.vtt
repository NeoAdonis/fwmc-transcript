04:50.620 --> 04:53.338
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

04:53.559 --> 04:57.067
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

04:57.087 --> 05:00.295
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:01.236 --> 05:06.718
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:06.998 --> 05:09.499
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:09.539 --> 05:14.801
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:15.221 --> 05:19.143
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:19.543 --> 05:22.984
Thank you for joining us for our 14th episode!

05:25.265 --> 05:27.566
BAU BAU!

05:27.606 --> 05:28.526
Ruffians!

05:28.726 --> 05:29.386
It's Friday!

05:29.506 --> 05:31.207
It's Friday!

05:32.528 --> 05:36.169
I feel like Ruffians really like Fridays, right?

05:36.229 --> 05:36.749
Friday!

05:37.069 --> 05:37.649
Yeah.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.050
Isn't there a saying?

05:39.350 --> 05:39.530
Huh?

05:40.470 --> 05:40.890
Friday.

05:45.063 --> 05:46.924
Fluffy and Fuzzy Friday.

05:46.964 --> 05:47.565
Is that it?

05:47.645 --> 05:49.526
It's a bit difficult to say.

05:49.546 --> 05:50.567
Is that it?

05:50.587 --> 05:51.668
Maybe that's how it goes.

05:51.908 --> 05:54.670
I don't know, the Ruffians seem... Happy Fluffy Fuzzy Friday.

05:56.271 --> 05:59.093
The Ruffians seem to be extra... Nice.

05:59.694 --> 05:59.934
Extra.

05:59.974 --> 06:00.554
Energetic.

06:00.854 --> 06:01.595
Smiley.

06:02.215 --> 06:03.496
Extra kind today.

06:03.516 --> 06:06.058
Silly, maybe a bit silly.

06:06.078 --> 06:09.401
Thank you for all the gift submissions!

06:09.461 --> 06:10.341
Thank you!

06:10.361 --> 06:10.962
Let's BAU BAU!

06:11.102 --> 06:12.122
Member Gift Friday.

06:12.143 --> 06:13.624
Member Gift Friday?

06:15.503 --> 06:20.448
To explain, we got off track.

06:20.568 --> 06:28.335
For Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:28.975 --> 06:33.079
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:33.720 --> 06:38.624
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face, not Moco-chan's face.

06:39.685 --> 06:40.385
Your face!

06:41.106 --> 06:44.007
And start your day off on the right paw.

06:44.527 --> 06:50.670
Ruffians, please make sure to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.752
Let's all BAU BAU to FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:55.072 --> 06:57.113
BAU BAU!

06:57.153 --> 07:03.295
Well, Ruffians, I guess maybe it's not too surprising.

07:04.076 --> 07:05.596
Do you know what's gonna come next?

07:08.308 --> 07:11.949
Well, there's been another Pero Sighting!

07:12.469 --> 07:17.871
Wait, I see this one.

07:18.131 --> 07:20.592
Here is... What do we have?

07:21.293 --> 07:22.013
Oh, he's in the back!

07:22.073 --> 07:27.495
It seems like Pero has spotted crashing a wedding and attempting to steal their...

07:28.740 --> 07:30.942
Pon-de-ring wall?

07:31.422 --> 07:33.224
Is this a normal thing at weddings?

07:36.046 --> 07:44.214
Maybe it might be nice to get married if it means I can have a wall of pon-de-rings, you know?

07:44.234 --> 07:48.497
Who cares about who you're marrying if I can eat a hundred?

07:48.557 --> 07:48.978
No.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.240
Two hundred and fifty pon-de-ring.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.921
A hundred, I don't know.

07:53.101 --> 07:54.723
But two hundred and fifty, yeah.

07:56.888 --> 07:58.512
250 pon-de-rings for free.

07:58.632 --> 08:00.998
Yeah, apparently that's what this Ruffian said.

08:01.018 --> 08:02.261
There's over 250 pon-de-rings in attendance!

08:04.989 --> 08:06.830
Wanderings in attendance.

08:06.870 --> 08:11.432
Yeah, I can't really blame Pero for trying to crash the wedding and take the donuts, you know?

08:11.912 --> 08:15.314
You know, hopefully he was bringing some for us though, right?

08:15.614 --> 08:17.335
Not just gonna eat them all himself, right?

08:17.355 --> 08:17.595
No!

08:18.615 --> 08:22.277
I think he could probably store a lot inside of him, but he needs to share.

08:22.557 --> 08:23.518
We're good at that.

08:23.578 --> 08:24.338
He should share too.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.759
He should share too, right?

08:25.779 --> 08:27.440
Well, you know...

08:28.420 --> 08:35.743
Ruffian, I think you did a very good job as the King of Donuts because you were able to keep Pero away!

08:35.823 --> 08:36.584
BAU BAU BAU!

08:36.644 --> 08:40.905
Congratulations!

08:41.246 --> 08:44.287
But do you have any idea where he went afterwards?

08:44.307 --> 08:46.728
That would be helpful, right Moco-chan?

08:47.994 --> 08:51.135
He probably can't go far with phone rings inside, right?

08:52.215 --> 08:53.295
Well, maybe he didn't get it.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.495
Maybe he's just, I'm gonna go somewhere else.

08:56.036 --> 08:56.376
Escape.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.896
Escape, yeah.

08:58.196 --> 09:01.857
Anyways, Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more sightings.

09:02.577 --> 09:06.717
Remember to use the hashtag, FWMCMORNING, okay?

09:06.777 --> 09:07.478
Okay!

09:08.498 --> 09:10.318
BAU BAU!

09:11.118 --> 09:11.578
BAU BAU!

09:11.598 --> 09:14.839
We had some big news just the other day.

09:16.397 --> 09:21.982
Ruffians, you know, we had... De-den!

09:22.102 --> 09:24.964
Lifetime Showtime!

09:24.984 --> 09:38.255
As part of our celebration of spending one month from our debut, we were able to premiere the video for our original introduction song, Lifetime Showtime!

09:38.295 --> 09:39.175
You heard right!

09:39.656 --> 09:41.838
You've been listening to it lots, right, Ruffians?

09:43.038 --> 09:43.459
Yeah!

09:43.519 --> 09:44.761
Lifetime Showtime!

09:44.981 --> 09:46.082
You're still stuck in your head?

09:46.223 --> 09:46.944
Perfect!

09:47.084 --> 09:47.525
Perfect!

09:47.585 --> 09:49.487
That's exactly how it should be.

09:49.607 --> 09:50.168
Exactly.

09:50.188 --> 09:55.055
You know, we're really so thrilled to finally be able to share it with you all like this.

09:57.318 --> 10:00.780
We hope that we'll be able to do more with it in the future too.

10:00.980 --> 10:05.983
And you know, have more opportunities in the future too.

10:06.183 --> 10:07.204
Lifetime Showtime.

10:07.724 --> 10:16.850
Maybe Ruffians, maybe someone don't know, but Lifetime Showtime was written by Suo Patra-san. She's a VTuber and a creator that we really really like and admire.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.373
We were really so happy to be able to work with her!

10:21.194 --> 10:24.417
It was a really fun process, right, Moco-chan?

10:24.437 --> 10:25.478
It was so good!

10:25.498 --> 10:33.546
We hope that, Ruffians, that maybe you'll treasure this song just as much as we do, and that it never leaves your head.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.468
Make sure to listen more, okay?

10:35.948 --> 10:37.410
So that it can get thoroughly...

10:38.470 --> 10:39.791
Input it in your head.

10:40.852 --> 10:42.493
Maybe in like the bloodstream too.

10:42.673 --> 10:43.374
That deep.

10:44.014 --> 10:44.775
Very deep.

10:45.255 --> 10:48.237
Yeah, so you feel it in your bloody.

10:48.537 --> 10:49.598
In the bawdy.

10:50.939 --> 10:52.220
In the bowens.

10:52.660 --> 10:53.361
The bowens?

10:53.461 --> 10:53.881
Yeah.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.003
Like deep in the bowens.

10:58.384 --> 11:05.486
You know, it was actually a really big dream of ours to be able to debut with an original intro song.

11:05.526 --> 11:07.267
So we're happy that it came true.

11:07.407 --> 11:13.469
You know, you only ever debut once, so... We're lucky, right, Moco-chan?

11:15.210 --> 11:19.311
Please, Ruffians, yell FUWAMOCO out while listening to it, okay?

11:19.351 --> 11:20.351
Can we practice a bit?

11:20.491 --> 11:22.532
Oh, that way Ruffians won't be so embarrassed.

11:23.646 --> 11:24.086
Fuwa.

11:24.246 --> 11:24.647
Moco.

11:24.687 --> 11:25.127
Fuwa.

11:25.187 --> 11:25.868
Why is it like this?

11:25.888 --> 11:26.308
Fuwa.

11:26.448 --> 11:27.369
Mocoi.

11:28.810 --> 11:29.270
Fuwa.

11:29.490 --> 11:29.991
Mocoi.

11:30.031 --> 11:30.431
Fuwa.

11:30.451 --> 11:30.992
Mocoi.

11:31.092 --> 11:31.652
Fuwa.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.193
Mocoi.

11:32.433 --> 11:36.456
Ruffians, you did it together with us, right?

11:36.476 --> 11:38.978
That feels a bit more right.

11:39.038 --> 11:42.580
Why did we start backwards?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.423
Ruffians, don't forget, okay?

11:45.903 --> 11:47.844
You can start backwards from your oshi, too.

11:48.205 --> 11:49.586
Ai.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.875
Maybe it changes things up a little bit.

11:55.595 --> 11:57.856
BAU BAU!

11:57.876 --> 11:58.256
Thank you!

11:58.276 --> 11:59.537
FUWAMOCO!

11:59.557 --> 12:01.497
FUWAMOCO!

12:01.577 --> 12:03.858
And... You have a surprise.

12:04.938 --> 12:06.239
Ruffians!

12:06.319 --> 12:06.519
No!

12:06.539 --> 12:09.900
It's your favorite part of the day!

12:11.160 --> 12:13.781
Misunderstanding.

12:15.842 --> 12:17.423
And... BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

12:20.695 --> 12:22.196
We did it!

12:22.236 --> 12:24.477
The second time in history!

12:24.717 --> 12:27.979
Today there are no misunderstandings.

12:28.019 --> 12:29.139
Gone windy.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.721
No misunderstandings.

12:32.241 --> 12:34.082
We're so happy.

12:34.682 --> 12:37.763
Ruffians, let's let out a big BAU BAU together!

12:38.244 --> 12:41.065
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

12:43.706 --> 12:44.247
Where are you?

12:44.307 --> 12:45.568
No misunderstandings!

12:46.028 --> 12:47.610
No misunderstandings!

12:47.750 --> 12:48.350
It's correct.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.291
Correct, right?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.212
Until Monday.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.800
Don't say things like that, okay?

12:59.940 --> 13:02.502
Ruffians are especially silly today.

13:02.662 --> 13:07.186
Why are you acting like it's the end of the world?

13:12.810 --> 13:17.394
Well, at least I'm hoping that there's not going to be any new misunderstandings.

13:17.414 --> 13:20.697
Maybe we can make it days without misunderstandings too.

13:20.757 --> 13:24.040
Yeah, you know we have our collab with Abyss and- I guess there will be more days.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.382
I don't know if it's over the weekend.

13:26.502 --> 13:31.727
We're playing with the park and everything, and Nerissa, and Shiori, and Biboo.

13:31.747 --> 13:32.908
I don't know about them.

13:33.488 --> 13:38.793
If we haven't had any misunderstandings since the last FUWAMOCO Morning, wouldn't it be more than just one day?

13:40.063 --> 13:42.325
I don't want to think that hard about it, Moco-chan.

13:42.365 --> 13:44.607
You know, this is good just as it is.

13:45.667 --> 13:46.848
No misunderstanding.

13:46.908 --> 13:47.349
No math.

13:47.729 --> 13:48.610
This is how it is.

13:48.850 --> 13:49.170
Yeah.

13:50.711 --> 13:51.392
Yeah.

13:53.113 --> 13:56.996
But, we actually have something that we want to share.

13:57.316 --> 14:00.259
Something that we want to confess with the Ruffians today.

14:00.859 --> 14:01.640
To the Ruffians.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.680
Not with the Ruffians.

14:03.861 --> 14:06.143
Unless, Ruffians, you're the same too.

14:06.243 --> 14:07.804
Maybe you have the same confession.

14:07.824 --> 14:09.626
Hopefully not.

14:10.239 --> 14:13.921
Well, Ruffians I think are better than not.

14:14.581 --> 14:18.702
We have something to divulge.

14:20.483 --> 14:22.884
To get off our chest.

14:22.984 --> 14:24.205
Collective chest.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.926
Do you know what it is, Ruffians?

14:28.206 --> 14:29.507
Probably not.

14:30.908 --> 14:36.150
If you knew what it is, then Ruffians, you probably are the same as us right now.

14:38.571 --> 14:39.091
It's this.

14:43.022 --> 14:44.543
That's not us, but it is us.

14:44.563 --> 14:49.947
We haven't slept yet since we all had so much fun playing River City Girls.

14:50.788 --> 15:01.436
But it's okay though because we're feeling good and most importantly we got a lot of homework done!

15:01.956 --> 15:05.599
You know we can have lots more fun together because we got it done.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.200
It's not like we're putting it off or anything.

15:09.220 --> 15:09.781
No, no.

15:10.061 --> 15:10.741
It wasn't that.

15:10.821 --> 15:15.462
It was just, you know, you want to do it, but then you just can't.

15:15.762 --> 15:20.063
Yeah, like there's a lot of things going on and it just never really happens.

15:20.203 --> 15:20.723
Yeah.

15:20.783 --> 15:24.784
You mean to, but it's just like... It got away from me.

15:25.444 --> 15:25.944
Yeah.

15:25.964 --> 15:27.664
So, we finally got it!

15:28.105 --> 15:29.945
Almost, almost all done.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.840
We've been able to focus pretty well too, right Moco-chan?

15:33.981 --> 15:35.222
It's good.

15:35.463 --> 15:39.468
Because you know sometimes when you don't sleep, you think, I'm gonna get it all done!

15:39.548 --> 15:40.149
It'll be good!

15:40.169 --> 15:41.711
I have so much time!

15:41.851 --> 15:47.019
As you go along, it's just like... The train is stopping.

15:48.300 --> 15:48.480
No!

15:48.801 --> 15:49.361
We're still good!

15:49.401 --> 15:50.222
We're still good!

15:50.662 --> 15:58.489
And maybe Ruffians, maybe you can tell a little bit, but actually we get a little silly when we don't sleep for a little while.

15:58.950 --> 16:02.373
So hopefully we're not too crazy today.

16:06.351 --> 16:07.792
It'll be good.

16:07.912 --> 16:11.514
It'll make the Piko Park collab even better.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.136
Ruffians, it's important.

16:14.156 --> 16:15.176
Listen, listen, listen.

16:15.377 --> 16:16.117
Losing clothes.

16:16.177 --> 16:21.761
We know it's not good to do these kinds of things, so we're not gonna make it a habit.

16:21.861 --> 16:22.661
No habits!

16:23.322 --> 16:27.624
So, Ruffians, definitely do not copy us.

16:28.545 --> 16:31.327
Good kids don't follow our bad influences.

16:32.731 --> 16:33.532
Be good, okay?

16:33.592 --> 16:34.872
Be a good Ruffian, okay?

16:36.813 --> 16:37.573
Understood!

16:39.654 --> 16:40.034
Whoops!

16:40.494 --> 16:41.274
No whoops!

16:41.434 --> 16:42.535
What a role model.

16:42.915 --> 16:54.239
Oh, but if you say it like that, then... Well, you know, I didn't sleep.

16:55.059 --> 16:56.480
It was all for your sake.

16:57.958 --> 16:58.398
Oh no.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.560
Oh no.

17:00.841 --> 17:05.265
This ties in with something else, but... Ruffians, you've done it.

17:06.105 --> 17:06.886
You've done it.

17:08.007 --> 17:08.948
BAU BAU.

17:09.148 --> 17:09.609
Moco-chan!

17:09.729 --> 17:10.309
Moco-chan!

17:10.569 --> 17:12.351
We have to keep things moving, okay?

17:12.371 --> 17:15.334
FUWAMOCO Morning only lasts so many minutes!

17:16.783 --> 17:17.884
We're professionals, right?

17:17.904 --> 17:19.465
Do the Ruffians even care?

17:21.226 --> 17:21.967
We're professionals!

17:22.007 --> 17:23.728
We're on air, Moco-chan!

17:24.548 --> 17:24.929
Oh no.

17:24.949 --> 17:27.951
Are we gonna have to apologize for this later?

17:29.692 --> 17:30.633
Shikkari shite!

17:30.653 --> 17:30.993
Moco-chan!

17:31.153 --> 17:32.174
Shikkari shite yo!

17:35.476 --> 17:35.856
Okay.

17:36.237 --> 17:38.478
A professional smile is all we needed.

17:38.578 --> 17:38.899
Yeah.

17:39.299 --> 17:41.040
Oh.

17:46.923 --> 17:47.643
The next topic.

17:47.823 --> 17:50.424
I guess it's sort of similar to sleeping.

17:51.224 --> 17:52.184
Or not sleeping.

17:52.664 --> 17:53.064
Which one?

17:53.204 --> 17:54.005
But sort of sleeping.

17:55.085 --> 18:02.086
So, you might have seen on Twitter the other day... About Fuwawa.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.227
You know.

18:05.947 --> 18:08.688
So, when we were going to sleep...

18:10.011 --> 18:14.453
We have both been in our beds for around maybe 10 minutes or so?

18:14.513 --> 18:15.774
Maybe 15 minutes.

18:15.914 --> 18:17.615
I was really sleepy.

18:17.895 --> 18:26.700
When I heard Fuwawa take a deep breath, like really really deep, like... That bad?

18:26.740 --> 18:27.340
Yeah, like...

18:28.786 --> 18:29.647
Did you hear my voice?

18:29.747 --> 18:31.788
Like, curvy!

18:32.188 --> 18:33.569
Curvy!

18:33.609 --> 18:35.270
Really, really loud!

18:35.390 --> 18:36.471
It made me jump.

18:37.172 --> 18:42.075
And then... Then you said, I'm just waiting for you to wake up, okay, Moco-chan?

18:42.095 --> 18:42.515
Scary.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.817
Yeah, in sort of like a huffy way.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.618
A huffy way like... Yeah.

18:46.638 --> 18:55.024
So I was really confused because obviously I hadn't even slept yet and it wasn't time to wake up either.

18:55.544 --> 18:58.506
So I tried to let Fuwawa know that

18:59.506 --> 19:01.107
It's not time to wake up yet!

19:01.467 --> 19:02.887
But she didn't like my answer.

19:02.907 --> 19:06.949
It was just all like, well, let me know when you're gonna get up then.

19:06.969 --> 19:08.029
Or something like that.

19:08.049 --> 19:08.549
That mean.

19:08.569 --> 19:09.670
That doesn't sound like me.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.490
No.

19:11.290 --> 19:12.570
When you're sleepy you're mean.

19:14.191 --> 19:15.591
But do you remember any of this?

19:15.852 --> 19:16.752
I don't.

19:17.932 --> 19:29.820
I don't... I remember waking up at one point and checking my clock and being like... It feels like I slept for 12 hours, but it's only been one hour.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.821
That's so weird.

19:32.262 --> 19:32.842
Or maybe not.

19:33.142 --> 19:34.363
It wasn't even one hour.

19:34.383 --> 19:41.047
It was just that my clock when I went to sleep had the big numbers saying... One big numbers?

19:41.147 --> 19:42.128
One set of big numbers?

19:42.148 --> 19:43.569
What does that mean?

19:45.890 --> 19:47.471
I thought it said a big number!

19:47.551 --> 19:50.232
I looked at it again and it changed to another number.

19:50.392 --> 19:50.532
Oh!

19:51.552 --> 19:52.792
So I thought it was one hour.

19:53.032 --> 19:54.093
But it wasn't one hour.

19:54.173 --> 20:00.375
It was probably just like you said, 15 minutes or something.

20:00.415 --> 20:06.596
For what it's worth, I did check the tweet with you to make sure it was okay before I sent it.

20:06.656 --> 20:07.797
But do you remember it?

20:07.897 --> 20:09.197
I remember that.

20:09.217 --> 20:10.097
Kind of.

20:10.258 --> 20:12.098
I remember being a bit grumpy.

20:12.638 --> 20:15.019
And being like, as long as it doesn't make me look bad.

20:19.101 --> 20:20.041
Really?

20:20.081 --> 20:21.582
Thank you, Ruffians!

20:22.422 --> 20:24.883
Do you feel different towards me now?

20:29.905 --> 20:33.207
There's no answer!

20:33.887 --> 20:35.167
Mococo is good!

20:35.187 --> 20:38.909
Mococo is good!

20:39.289 --> 20:41.170
The Ruffians still love you, it's okay.

20:41.590 --> 20:42.310
It's okay!

20:42.690 --> 20:43.351
It's okay!

20:44.780 --> 20:46.042
I'm glad.

20:46.342 --> 20:46.762
I'm glad.

20:47.263 --> 20:50.987
Definitely out of the two of us, Fuwawa sleep talks a lot more.

20:51.627 --> 20:59.075
But it's sort of fun because if you respond to her, you can try to pick her brain while she's sleep talking.

20:59.575 --> 21:02.999
So if you ask things about what she's saying, it's sort of fun.

21:04.840 --> 21:10.887
Usually she'll just get mad because you don't really understand what she's talking about and just keep on asking questions.

21:11.387 --> 21:13.529
Like, what are you doing with the blueberries?

21:14.130 --> 21:17.233
And then she'll be like, Moco-chan, of course I'm doing this with them!

21:19.109 --> 21:21.811
Like, it's my fault for not understanding.

21:21.831 --> 21:25.373
You need to understand all the time, Moco-chan!

21:26.054 --> 21:27.895
Why don't you understand the reality?

21:27.915 --> 21:29.356
That's how the sleep talking goes.

21:30.777 --> 21:33.459
I don't know why, it seems like you talk about blueberries a lot.

21:33.659 --> 21:38.822
I don't know, I just have blue on the brain, huh?

21:39.563 --> 21:39.783
Yeah.

21:41.144 --> 21:42.425
Watch out Ruffians!

21:42.785 --> 21:43.525
Moco-chan!

21:43.805 --> 21:48.127
Moco-chan might get you while you're deep asleep and make you sleep talk to her!

21:48.927 --> 21:49.968
I'll make you sleep talk!

21:50.768 --> 21:52.429
And then I'll tweet about it!

21:52.449 --> 21:54.329
Scary!

21:54.730 --> 21:56.350
Spooky!

21:56.410 --> 21:58.211
You wouldn't want that, right?

22:01.252 --> 22:05.255
Well, Ruffians, it's good that Moco-chan's in a good mood right now.

22:05.796 --> 22:12.841
Because I have something to share with you today.

22:17.004 --> 22:17.444
I don't know.

22:18.084 --> 22:20.386
Someone, just someone, I happen to know.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.768
Ruffians, you happen to know too.

22:22.788 --> 22:25.570
There's been quite a handful recently.

22:30.435 --> 22:30.755
Yes!

22:31.375 --> 22:32.096
That's it!

22:32.776 --> 22:35.017
Moco-chan, it's you!

22:35.117 --> 22:36.457
Moco-chan!

22:38.378 --> 22:41.280
She, she has been something.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.281
Yes, that she is you, Moco-chan.

22:44.961 --> 22:51.185
You've been very needy, and I just can't really deal with it.

22:51.205 --> 22:57.869
You know, Ruffians, I talked about it a bit during River City Girls, but it's gotten even worse since then.

22:58.249 --> 23:00.171
I think you're just exaggerating things.

23:00.651 --> 23:00.891
No.

23:00.911 --> 23:05.714
Moco-chan, she's been really clingy and a bit sulky recently.

23:05.734 --> 23:08.696
You seem sort of happy about it.

23:09.648 --> 23:11.950
No, I'm just informing the Ruffians.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.032
You know, cause I need help.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.233
I need help.

23:15.513 --> 23:21.538
But Moco-chan, she keeps on whining and being like, I wanna spend more time with the Ruffians!

23:21.638 --> 23:23.720
I want to see them now!

23:24.220 --> 23:25.781
Why can't it be now?

23:27.763 --> 23:30.505
That doesn't sound like me at all.

23:30.665 --> 23:32.366
Ruffians are busy, you know?

23:32.406 --> 23:34.208
That's why we have a strict schedule.

23:34.268 --> 23:43.034
So that we can be able to have lots of fun together at the specific times, playing the specific games, doing the specific things, you know?

23:43.715 --> 23:44.676
But she doesn't stop.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.177
She's needy!

23:46.517 --> 23:47.338
She's clingy!

23:47.478 --> 23:48.459
You're just exaggerating, okay?

23:48.479 --> 23:49.220
I can't take it!

23:49.300 --> 23:51.883
I can't take it any longer, Moco-chan!

23:52.323 --> 24:00.632
So, Ruffians, I see there's already a lot of headpats, but please, if you could give her some headpats, maybe tell her it'll be okay.

24:01.013 --> 24:06.799
You know, let her know how much you're looking forward to our streams and how much you're looking forward to be able to chat.

24:07.259 --> 24:10.501
I think that might help Moco-chan calm down a little bit.

24:10.761 --> 24:11.501
And Twitter, too.

24:11.601 --> 24:12.281
Twitter, too?

24:12.362 --> 24:13.142
Twitter, too?

24:13.662 --> 24:14.062
Yeah.

24:14.683 --> 24:15.943
It would help me a lot, too.

24:19.485 --> 24:21.726
Let's all be kind to Moco-chan, okay?

24:22.066 --> 24:22.446
Always.

24:23.127 --> 24:23.627
Forever.

24:24.347 --> 24:24.827
Every day.

24:25.948 --> 24:26.508
Every minute.

24:27.309 --> 24:28.269
Maybe me, too.

24:28.689 --> 24:30.770
Since I have to deal with this.

24:32.431 --> 24:32.591
Yeah.

24:37.463 --> 24:38.184
It's tough.

24:39.105 --> 24:39.925
Right, Ruffians?

24:39.985 --> 24:41.487
Are there any older Ruffians?

24:41.507 --> 24:43.448
Like older sibling Ruffians out there?

24:43.629 --> 24:46.091
Older Ruffian, you're an older Ruffian.

24:46.211 --> 24:47.592
I'm not an older Ruffian.

24:47.732 --> 24:48.473
You're older.

24:48.513 --> 24:51.175
I'm not an older Ruffian, I'm Fuwawa!

24:52.096 --> 24:52.677
And older.

24:53.397 --> 24:54.538
You just admitted it.

24:56.446 --> 25:00.670
I'm a bit older than you, but... Not ancient, no.

25:02.591 --> 25:03.712
Well, Ruffians!

25:04.292 --> 25:11.058
We wanted to explain something that maybe is a bit of a mystery to you, but I think it's kind of an interesting story, right?

25:11.538 --> 25:11.918
Maybe.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.521
I wanna ask you a simple color- uh, question.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.784
A simple question.

25:19.844 --> 25:22.085
Don't laugh, Moco-chan!

25:22.745 --> 25:23.926
A simple question!

25:24.387 --> 25:25.267
About colors.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.729
A simple color about questions.

25:27.869 --> 25:30.310
Understand!

25:30.370 --> 25:30.951
Colors!

25:32.232 --> 25:34.313
Ruffians, what are your favorite colors?

25:37.295 --> 25:37.515
Huh?

25:38.516 --> 25:38.696
Huh?

25:40.185 --> 25:40.585
Blue!

25:41.106 --> 25:41.986
Thank you!

25:43.707 --> 25:44.828
Red!

25:45.268 --> 25:46.549
I'm sorry about that, Moco-chan.

25:46.569 --> 25:50.912
Orange!

25:51.032 --> 25:52.693
That's Kiara-senpai.

25:54.394 --> 25:55.955
Your favorite colors!

25:56.335 --> 25:57.156
Purple!

25:57.176 --> 25:57.816
Orange!

25:58.296 --> 25:59.757
I'm getting concerned here.

26:00.398 --> 26:04.700
It's a simple question about colors, and I'm not seeing the answers!

26:04.980 --> 26:05.321
Why?! !

26:07.813 --> 26:10.534
Okay, well, I guess I'll just have to give the Ruffians the answer then.

26:10.954 --> 26:12.414
The answer was pink and blue.

26:13.034 --> 26:13.754
Blue and pink.

26:14.694 --> 26:16.775
Yeah.

26:17.415 --> 26:17.935
Wow!

26:19.075 --> 26:19.475
Why?

26:19.495 --> 26:22.636
Why are FUWAMOCO blue and pink?

26:22.716 --> 26:23.596
Why am I blue?

26:24.176 --> 26:25.477
Why is Moco-chan pink?

26:25.777 --> 26:28.417
The Ruffians even deserve the answer.

26:28.477 --> 26:29.697
No one said pink!

26:30.017 --> 26:31.158
I know, I know.

26:32.118 --> 26:33.038
Are you curious?

26:34.218 --> 26:36.539
Well... I guess.

26:36.939 --> 26:37.479
Well...

26:39.204 --> 26:40.905
It's actually really simple.

26:41.286 --> 26:41.946
It's simple.

26:42.567 --> 26:51.853
So you know, Mama Puppy could tell that she was gonna be having twins, and so she thought that she'd need an easy way to tell us apart.

26:52.774 --> 26:54.656
You know, sometimes it can be sort of tough, right?

26:54.716 --> 26:55.076
Right.

26:55.376 --> 26:56.397
Do you know what she did?

26:56.417 --> 26:56.477
Huh?

26:58.766 --> 27:05.027
Wow, she looked at a lot of blue and pink pictures, and also ate a lot of blue and pink seeds.

27:05.187 --> 27:10.529
I was thinking, you know, the first born will be blue, and the second will be pink.

27:11.609 --> 27:14.550
You know, that way... Does it count as image training?

27:15.070 --> 27:16.610
Image training, that's exactly it.

27:16.650 --> 27:22.591
But you know, that way, we're color-coded, and it'll be easy to know who's who, right?

27:22.671 --> 27:22.991
Right.

27:23.492 --> 27:23.732
Yeah.

27:24.692 --> 27:25.272
Of course.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.072
I see.

27:26.233 --> 27:26.413
I see.

27:26.433 --> 27:26.553
I see.

27:26.593 --> 27:26.733
I see.

27:47.552 --> 27:48.793
Why shaved ice though?

27:48.873 --> 27:49.533
Because it's yummy.

27:49.673 --> 27:52.655
Yeah, you know, that's just what Mama Puppy wanted to eat.

27:52.695 --> 27:53.235
Yeah, yeah.

27:53.415 --> 27:55.236
Of course you eat other nutrition foods though.

27:55.296 --> 27:55.856
Nutrition.

27:55.876 --> 27:56.537
Just shaved ice.

27:56.617 --> 27:57.257
Vitamins.

27:57.457 --> 28:02.199
Yeah, it was a lot of pink and blue shaved ice, but never mixed together!

28:02.219 --> 28:02.259
No.

28:02.399 --> 28:03.380
It was always separate.

28:03.620 --> 28:06.441
Blue shaved ice and pink shaved ice.

28:06.461 --> 28:06.942
No purple.

28:07.042 --> 28:08.843
Yeah, that would be confusing.

28:08.863 --> 28:09.803
That would be a problem.

28:10.323 --> 28:11.364
Yeah.

28:11.544 --> 28:14.486
So, you know when we were born and my eyes were pink?

28:15.666 --> 28:16.286
And blue.

28:17.067 --> 28:18.708
Yeah, Moco-chan's a blue.

28:18.868 --> 28:21.049
You know, she was really relieved, right?

28:21.089 --> 28:22.330
The wise puppies, they were right!

28:22.470 --> 28:23.550
That's why they're wise.

28:23.710 --> 28:25.912
Yeah, that's why they're wise.

28:26.192 --> 28:28.873
And you know, now it'd be easy to tell us apart!

28:28.973 --> 28:29.634
Yeah!

28:30.174 --> 28:30.354
Right?

28:30.674 --> 28:31.234
It came true.

28:31.535 --> 28:32.155
It came true.

28:32.195 --> 28:32.735
Good story.

28:32.935 --> 28:33.856
Meditash, meditash.

28:33.936 --> 28:41.300
Maybe this is a weird question, but don't you feel like if you were in Mama Puppy's place, that that would be your biggest concern too?

28:43.205 --> 28:47.586
A big concern.

28:47.966 --> 28:54.128
For us, you know, ever since we can remember, I've been blue, and Moco-chan, you've been pink!

28:54.348 --> 28:55.048
Yeah, not red.

28:55.448 --> 28:56.268
No, not red.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.068
No, not red, not red.

28:58.108 --> 28:58.909
Pink, pink.

28:59.909 --> 29:03.530
And if it's switched, you know, it just doesn't really feel right.

29:06.204 --> 29:10.026
Ten times worse than being pet backwards against your fluff.

29:10.806 --> 29:11.786
With a face.

29:13.267 --> 29:13.667
Not good.

29:14.427 --> 29:18.069
Ruffians or siblings, do you have a similar story?

29:18.169 --> 29:20.070
Any colloquial stories?

29:21.110 --> 29:21.911
I wonder.

29:22.131 --> 29:22.731
You know?

29:24.792 --> 29:25.592
Invincibles!

29:26.873 --> 29:27.413
I'm glad.

29:28.459 --> 29:30.139
Fuwawa is pink and Moco-chan is blue.

29:30.259 --> 29:30.879
No!

29:30.979 --> 29:31.359
No!

29:31.420 --> 29:32.780
That's wrong!

29:33.080 --> 29:33.420
No!

29:33.440 --> 29:35.300
You like pink better now.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.621
I see some Ruffians saying they like pink better now.

29:39.381 --> 29:46.482
Maybe Ruffians will think of Mama Puppy when they eat pink shaved ice and blue shaved ice?

29:46.782 --> 29:47.362
Not together.

29:47.642 --> 29:48.382
That's a little weird.

29:48.442 --> 29:51.343
Please don't think of Mama Puppy, okay?

29:52.103 --> 29:52.643
True, true.

29:52.903 --> 29:54.643
Think about Moco-chan or me.

29:54.903 --> 29:55.164
Yeah.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.644
Please, please, please.

29:56.924 --> 29:57.104
Yeah.

29:59.432 --> 30:00.212
Thank you!

30:01.733 --> 30:04.733
And we have some more happy news!

30:04.853 --> 30:05.714
Ruffians!

30:06.074 --> 30:11.275
The FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

30:11.375 --> 30:17.777
There are only two days left to submit your FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.958
I think a lot of Ruffians have made jingles.

30:20.998 --> 30:23.418
But there's still lots more coming in two weeks!

30:23.818 --> 30:24.458
Amazing.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.159
You don't need a reminder though, do you?

30:29.144 --> 30:31.945
Thank you Ruffians for your amazing submissions!

30:32.566 --> 30:36.848
At first, actually, we were really worried that you might not be that interested in it.

30:37.088 --> 30:43.492
So, we really want to say a big thank you for being brave and doing a lot of research into trying new things.

30:43.552 --> 30:49.335
You know, what it takes to make a jingle, make your first piece of music, you know.

30:49.435 --> 30:50.815
We love them so much!

30:51.336 --> 30:52.956
Thank you!

30:53.077 --> 30:53.617
You know what?

30:53.717 --> 30:56.979
It actually gives us a lot of courage to try new things too.

30:58.924 --> 31:01.345
Thank you!

31:02.426 --> 31:11.930
Next week, we're going to be showcasing some submissions and then announcing the selected jingle exactly one week today on September 8th, Friday.

31:13.170 --> 31:15.431
The Friday FUWAMOCO Morning.

31:15.652 --> 31:18.953
We hope that you'll be looking forward to it!

31:18.973 --> 31:24.557
It'll be another chapter of FUWAMOCO Morning history made all together.

31:25.177 --> 31:27.238
More history.

31:28.098 --> 31:30.960
I wonder what kind of historic moments we have in FUWAMOCO Morning.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.541
I can't think of any.

31:36.644 --> 31:37.565
Everyone's favorite.

31:38.085 --> 31:39.226
Everyone's favorite!

31:39.366 --> 31:41.367
It's the Doggie of the Day!

31:42.108 --> 31:43.829
And who do we have?

31:44.129 --> 31:47.951
Today's doggy is... Den!

31:48.412 --> 31:49.412
It's Moniac!

31:49.512 --> 31:51.834
Moniac!

31:51.894 --> 31:57.477
Moniac, she's a small troublemaker, but I'm sure she's an even bigger friend.

31:57.577 --> 31:58.278
Do we look the same?

32:01.440 --> 32:01.740
Morning!

32:19.894 --> 32:21.256
I don't think you should be shy.

32:22.097 --> 32:25.841
You're BAU-tiful no matter what kind of face you're making.

32:25.861 --> 32:26.302
No mood.

32:26.382 --> 32:27.963
Just show your BAU-ty.

32:28.204 --> 32:28.464
BAU-ty.

32:28.484 --> 32:31.447
I was kind of confused if you were saying BAU-ty.

32:36.926 --> 32:41.308
That was an attempt already.

32:41.748 --> 32:43.589
How does Morniac BAU BAU?

32:43.969 --> 32:47.430
I like to think maybe it's like a spiky... Like a BAU!

32:47.570 --> 32:47.951
BAU!

32:48.031 --> 32:49.451
Oh, I think it's a bit more like BAU!

32:49.871 --> 32:50.051
BAU!

32:50.372 --> 32:50.772
Oh, really?

32:50.792 --> 32:55.153
Like a muted... Not muted, just short.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.774
A short BAU BAU.

32:56.894 --> 32:59.935
Because Morniac's a small troublemaker?

33:00.476 --> 33:01.896
No, I just have that feeling.

33:01.916 --> 33:02.036
Okay.

33:05.526 --> 33:09.671
I think, you know, Morning likes to make mischief.

33:10.272 --> 33:10.753
Like us.

33:10.933 --> 33:11.894
Make funny faces.

33:13.176 --> 33:13.597
Us too.

33:15.739 --> 33:16.380
A little shy.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.082
I get it.

33:20.495 --> 33:21.295
Great friend!

33:22.576 --> 33:23.836
She's such a good girl.

33:24.157 --> 33:25.537
Great friend with great face.

33:25.857 --> 33:27.278
Thank you!

33:27.338 --> 33:28.739
BAU BAU!

33:28.799 --> 33:29.819
Thank you for the food!

33:29.839 --> 33:30.659
You get a treat now.

33:30.699 --> 33:31.960
Yeah, yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:32.380
BAU BAU!

33:37.919 --> 33:40.460
Today I went on a walk.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.241
Where did we go?

33:41.681 --> 33:43.702
This Ruffian went for a walk.

33:43.722 --> 33:47.824
Is that a painting?

33:48.284 --> 33:49.185
It looks like a painting.

33:49.205 --> 33:51.046
Such a pretty water river.

33:52.927 --> 33:55.269
It's a beautiful photo!

33:55.629 --> 34:00.212
We're so happy to hear that you're out enjoying the sights while on your way home.

34:00.252 --> 34:01.193
You're way home!

34:01.933 --> 34:02.273
Wow.

34:02.854 --> 34:08.558
You know, sometimes you can kind of get wrapped up in your thoughts after a busy day and just end up tuning everything else.

34:08.758 --> 34:09.538
But look around!

34:09.578 --> 34:11.539
There's so much beautiful stuff to look at!

34:11.920 --> 34:12.120
Right!

34:12.180 --> 34:18.564
And that's why I'm so glad that you took a detour out of your usual path just to take this photo for us!

34:18.804 --> 34:19.525
Just for us!

34:19.565 --> 34:20.265
Just for us!

34:20.385 --> 34:21.606
We're lucky, Moco-chan.

34:23.107 --> 34:26.369
Actually, you know, we like to do the same thing too, you know?

34:26.509 --> 34:32.573
Even just on like a little walk, we try to take at least one photo to kind of make it a bit special.

34:32.593 --> 34:33.634
Make a memory of it.

34:33.714 --> 34:34.535
Yeah, yeah.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.156
Oh, and there's boarding!

34:36.216 --> 34:40.058
Boarding goes on here too, like little boats.

34:40.658 --> 34:46.762
I don't know, maybe next time, instead of taking a walk, you could give kayaking a try!

34:46.782 --> 34:48.503
Can you kayak there?

34:48.524 --> 34:48.564
Oh!

34:51.365 --> 34:53.667
I don't know, but baby kayaking is kind of a big step.

34:53.848 --> 34:54.729
It's a bit scary.

34:55.669 --> 34:58.112
First swimming, then kayaking.

34:58.392 --> 35:02.477
BAU BAU!

35:04.559 --> 35:07.982
And next we have our Question of the Day!

35:08.823 --> 35:10.245
What kind of question do we have?

35:10.726 --> 35:11.347
De-den!

35:12.047 --> 35:12.168
Oh!

35:12.688 --> 35:22.362
You don't eat tomato, don't eat pizza, don't eat pasta, don't eat burgers, don't eat onion, don't eat burrito.

35:23.129 --> 35:25.350
So what exactly do you regularly eat?

35:26.031 --> 35:27.811
What's a normal FUWAMOCO breakfast?

35:28.272 --> 35:28.692
Dinner?

35:29.132 --> 35:31.373
I want to eat your regular meals as well.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.034
Those aren't our meals!

35:33.074 --> 35:34.515
You can't eat them!

35:34.555 --> 35:40.398
We'll share our food with each other, but I don't think there's that much.

35:41.118 --> 35:42.119
What we eat?

35:42.799 --> 35:43.879
I don't know, it's not very interesting.

35:43.899 --> 35:45.360
It's not very interesting.

35:45.440 --> 35:52.522
I know we talked a bit about, I don't know, what we thought was our silly eating habits, but maybe it's not.

35:52.582 --> 36:01.644
Maybe it's not, but in an ideal world, you know, we like to eat Japanese food, Chinese food, Indian or Thai cuisines.

36:01.984 --> 36:03.145
Sushi, sashimi.

36:04.025 --> 36:06.125
And of course, lots of wagashi.

36:06.245 --> 36:06.746
Sweet, sweet!

36:06.786 --> 36:08.486
JAPAN DOPE!

36:08.526 --> 36:09.186
Yeah, yeah.

36:09.226 --> 36:09.806
Milky yum.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.847
But, you know, reality, it's not the same.

36:13.947 --> 36:18.108
So we eat kind of stuff like, you know, chicken, natto.

36:18.148 --> 36:19.868
Natto for me in the morning.

36:20.528 --> 36:21.528
Cucumber.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.089
Aojiru.

36:23.309 --> 36:25.269
Aojiru is like a green veggie drink.

36:25.629 --> 36:27.129
We have that with soy milk.

36:27.169 --> 36:27.389
Soy milk.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.650
We have raw veggies.

36:29.710 --> 36:30.590
Miso soup.

36:31.330 --> 36:34.152
I really like to have nori as a snack, like the seaweed.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.172
Yeah, yeah.

36:35.252 --> 36:38.654
Sometimes almonds, eggs, stuff like that.

36:38.734 --> 36:42.556
And we talked about it before, but cream cheese on unhealthy bread.

36:42.576 --> 36:43.377
Healthy bread.

36:43.837 --> 36:44.137
Yeah.

36:44.157 --> 36:51.321
But generally, you know, simple foods are cost-efficient, have good vitamins, and no chance in it.

36:51.521 --> 36:55.683
We've been pretty busy recently, so we've been keeping things especially simple.

36:55.703 --> 36:56.143
Keep it simple.

36:56.243 --> 36:56.924
Lamb!

36:56.944 --> 36:57.544
That's fancy.

36:57.624 --> 36:58.625
That's so fancy!

36:59.585 --> 37:00.746
That would be yummy though.

37:00.806 --> 37:06.909
But you know, we kinda keep things really simple to the point that everything's more or less the same for months and months.

37:18.214 --> 37:20.495
You know, it wakes us up because we never seem to get tired.

37:20.695 --> 37:21.075
Yeah.

37:21.495 --> 37:21.896
It's good.

37:22.296 --> 37:31.780
You know, for example, one summer, we more or less just ate our own special recipe for Japanese hiyashi-chuka, like summer cold noodles.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.580
Not hayashi-chuka.

37:33.660 --> 37:34.521
It's okay!

37:34.541 --> 37:34.761
Yeah.

37:35.121 --> 37:36.902
Yeah, hiyashi-chuka.

37:37.382 --> 37:42.504
But, you know, it would be nice to have some special yummies again someday soon, but...

37:43.104 --> 37:43.885
It's okay, you know.

37:43.965 --> 37:51.032
I think in the end we're just very picky, maybe weird, maybe particular eaters in general.

37:51.413 --> 37:52.574
But we like a lot of food.

37:52.814 --> 38:00.222
We just don't like those foods with pasta and onions and tomatoes and stuff.

38:00.802 --> 38:02.164
Ruffians, are you the same?

38:02.184 --> 38:02.264
Same!

38:02.864 --> 38:03.285
Same!

38:03.365 --> 38:03.705
Same!

38:07.397 --> 38:09.598
You understood, understood.

38:09.798 --> 38:10.398
Tasty thing.

38:10.478 --> 38:11.258
Poor puppies.

38:11.738 --> 38:12.779
No, no, no.

38:12.859 --> 38:13.359
It's okay.

38:13.379 --> 38:14.499
Fussy puppy maybe.

38:14.839 --> 38:16.360
Maybe we're fluffy fussy.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.780
Poor Pero.

38:18.180 --> 38:19.561
Fluffy fussy.

38:20.321 --> 38:20.781
Fuzzy.

38:21.681 --> 38:22.302
Fussy fussy.

38:22.562 --> 38:23.102
No onions?

38:23.142 --> 38:24.222
Of course no onions.

38:24.362 --> 38:25.423
No, no, no.

38:25.643 --> 38:27.843
I don't want to even be around an onion.

38:28.103 --> 38:28.804
No, thank you.

38:28.944 --> 38:30.204
It's worse when they're there.

38:30.624 --> 38:31.064
What's it?

38:31.664 --> 38:32.324
Sautéed.

38:32.664 --> 38:34.145
Ah, the flavor comes out.

38:34.165 --> 38:34.465
The smell.

38:34.585 --> 38:35.545
The smell is awful.

38:35.645 --> 38:35.825
No.

38:35.905 --> 38:36.365
Uh-uh.

38:36.565 --> 38:37.125
No.

38:37.145 --> 38:37.505
Uh-uh.

38:37.706 --> 38:38.686
It tastes like worms.

38:38.746 --> 38:40.506
Sorry, I can't be around an onion.

38:40.726 --> 38:41.106
No.

38:41.226 --> 38:41.546
Uh-uh.

38:41.626 --> 38:42.126
No.

38:42.927 --> 38:43.407
Garlic?

38:43.707 --> 38:44.987
Garlic is questionable.

38:45.327 --> 38:45.507
Uh-uh.

38:45.827 --> 38:46.467
It's questionable.

38:46.507 --> 38:47.267
We're not friends.

38:47.968 --> 38:48.188
No.

38:49.648 --> 38:49.828
Yeah.

38:50.228 --> 38:50.788
Understood.

38:51.928 --> 38:54.009
I'd say it's like a 25% eat.

38:54.489 --> 38:54.869
What?

38:55.069 --> 38:55.489
Garlic.

38:55.609 --> 38:56.149
Oh, garlic?

38:56.229 --> 38:56.469
Yeah.

38:56.549 --> 38:56.909
Maybe.

38:56.969 --> 38:57.350
Yeah.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.130
Poor Aqua-senpai.

39:01.218 --> 39:03.559
I'm sorry.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.041
Purple onions are the worst actually.

39:06.061 --> 39:06.361
BAU BAU!

39:06.381 --> 39:06.721
BAU BAU!

39:06.801 --> 39:09.383
And for our next stream, we have...

39:19.296 --> 39:20.558
Pico-Pike!

39:22.540 --> 39:22.820
Yes!

39:23.441 --> 39:26.203
We are playing Pico-Pike together with Abyssgard!

39:26.784 --> 39:31.529
I'm really looking forward to it, but I think it's going to be really, really crazy.

39:31.569 --> 39:37.995
Especially because Moco-chan and I are going to be sharing the controller!

39:38.055 --> 39:38.536
I don't know how.

39:39.477 --> 39:39.897
I'm not sure.

39:39.957 --> 39:40.858
We will fight!

39:41.318 --> 39:41.618
Fight!

39:41.998 --> 39:42.338
Fight!

39:42.398 --> 39:43.078
Rock, paper, scissors?

39:43.538 --> 39:44.219
Rock, paper, scissors.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.259
Maybe.

39:45.799 --> 39:49.100
We'll do our best to make Abyss strong all together.

39:50.241 --> 39:50.701
BAU BAU!

39:50.741 --> 39:51.541
BAU BAU!

39:52.202 --> 39:53.462
And our schedule.

39:53.602 --> 39:57.183
And our schedule before it updates to next week's schedule.

39:57.684 --> 40:03.826
Where, well, I think this weekend's maybe a little bit more relaxed for us, but we'll still be having lots of fun.

40:04.086 --> 40:06.187
We're starting out our journey in It Takes Two.

40:07.347 --> 40:09.928
It's actually, it's going to be our first time playing it.

40:09.988 --> 40:10.888
I don't know anything.

40:11.068 --> 40:12.289
We're really looking forward to it.

40:12.309 --> 40:13.269
You know, it's a classic.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.849
A classic.

40:15.409 --> 40:17.090
Lots of Ruffians want to see it, so.

40:17.290 --> 40:17.870
Yeah, yeah.

40:18.090 --> 40:19.071
I'm excited for you.

40:19.231 --> 40:23.772
Sunday, we're going to be doing an extended Super Chat meeting.

40:23.832 --> 40:24.272
Yeah!

40:24.332 --> 40:25.052
Yeah!

40:25.413 --> 40:27.513
You're really excited, Moco-chan.

40:27.913 --> 40:28.493
I am!

40:28.654 --> 40:33.355
It's going to be starting early, and then we'll be going very, very, very late if needed.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.463
Yeah, we might get a little crazy with how long we might go.

40:37.483 --> 40:45.452
At the very least, I think we can say right now it'll be our longest stream yet.

40:45.832 --> 40:50.297
So, Ruffians, please make sure to get very cozy along with us, okay?

40:50.317 --> 40:50.698
BAU BAU!

40:55.151 --> 41:04.357
Well, Ruffians, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

41:04.638 --> 41:06.799
Happy Friday to you.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.381
Oh, Lime!

41:09.401 --> 41:10.061
Lima!

41:10.121 --> 41:11.142
Lima, sorry!

41:11.182 --> 41:11.782
Lima, BAU BAU!

41:11.823 --> 41:12.743
Momo, BAU BAU!

41:19.833 --> 41:21.514
FUWAMOCO BAU BAU!

41:36.941 --> 41:37.342
Coffee!

41:37.382 --> 41:37.902
Coffee!

41:38.002 --> 41:39.682
BAU BAU!

41:39.722 --> 41:41.223
Yuppa!

41:41.283 --> 41:42.723

41:42.743 --> 41:43.983
Hyuka!

41:44.123 --> 41:45.644
BAU BAU!

41:46.104 --> 41:52.586
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

41:53.026 --> 41:56.167
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

41:56.187 --> 41:57.487
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!

41:57.547 --> 41:58.927
BAU BAU!

42:01.929 --> 42:02.290
BAU BAU!
