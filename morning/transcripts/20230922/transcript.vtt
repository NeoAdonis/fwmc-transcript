00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:19.864
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:40.394
It's time for...

00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:41.655
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:44.736
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:46.737
BAU BAU!

00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:51.020
That was a bit of a surprising start.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.061
Good morning, Moco-chan!

00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:55.623
BAU BAU!

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:57.824
Can you hear BGM?

00:06:09.557 --> 00:06:12.719
Oh, it seems like maybe we don't have it for today.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.341
Well, let's go into introductions.

00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:18.863
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:21.225
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.246
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:25.628
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:06:26.068 --> 00:06:29.110
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:34.934
Thank you for joining us today for our 23rd episode!

00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:35.614
Thank you!

00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:36.415
BAU BAU!

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:37.976
BAU BAU!

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.002
Today started with a bit of a start.

00:06:45.022 --> 00:06:46.504
23 Episode 7.

00:06:46.804 --> 00:06:49.526
Every time it's a little bit different.

00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:53.951
For the first time Ruffians, let's explain a little bit about FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:55.672
FUWAMOCO Morning is...

00:06:56.693 --> 00:07:02.875
It's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO, and it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:03.855
A.K.A.

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:04.935
FUWAMOCO.

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:10.637
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw!

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:16.539
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.560
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.461
BAU BAU!

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:27.716
You never know what's going to happen with a new morning call.

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:33.882
I heard that there's some really exciting things happening this weekend, right Moco-chan?

00:07:34.443 --> 00:07:35.123
Right!

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:38.607
We have Mumei-senpai!

00:07:38.627 --> 00:07:44.152
Mumei-senpai is going to be having her 3D showcase tomorrow!

00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:46.648
Ruffians!

00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:47.970
You excited?

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.870
Of course.

00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.073
FUWAMOCO is too!

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:56.998
We're looking forward to seeing what Mumei-senpai is going to do.

00:07:57.078 --> 00:08:01.423
I'm excited to think, will Mumei-senpai have a drawing segment?

00:08:01.843 --> 00:08:04.666
Or maybe teach us more about civilization?

00:08:05.426 --> 00:08:06.608
Singing and dancing!

00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:07.969
Hopefully!

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.930
Hopefully!

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.670
I think so.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:17.137
Yeah, you know, I always look forward to the singing and dancing part, but I'm actually really excited for maybe what sort of place she brings us to.

00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:21.541
Just like Fauna-senpai's home course, and Kronii-senpai's worst days.

00:08:23.182 --> 00:08:24.263
I really like that.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:28.227
The forest is so pretty when it's glowing at night, right?

00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:30.449
I'm excited.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:35.013
I'm really looking forward to seeing Mumei-senpai move around, dance around,

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:37.355
Go freely and freely.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:38.215
Spread her wings.

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:39.476
No horror.

00:08:41.017 --> 00:08:43.399
No horror.

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:46.862
I really hope that there's no horror segment.

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:48.763
No horror segment.

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.006
Really cute.

00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:53.907
Only smiles.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.629
BAU BAU!

00:08:57.209 --> 00:08:57.930
Only smiles.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.210
Right.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.051
Right.

00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:04.535
There's actually some bad news, Ruffians.

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:07.295
Got bad news.

00:09:07.555 --> 00:09:08.195
Bad news.

00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:09.215
Already.

00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:14.437
You know, the morning is a bit different this morning, and now there's bad news.

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:14.897
Yeah.

00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:24.881
Well, last FUWAMOCO Morning, we told you about the good news that Papa Papa fixed that lightbulb that wouldn't work properly in the kitchen, right?

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:26.101
Right, the lightbulb?

00:09:26.861 --> 00:09:28.582
You remember, right, Ruffians?

00:09:32.378 --> 00:09:36.084
It was just a really super simple fix, just a little flick.

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:38.448
It was all good, right?

00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:39.349
Remember?

00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:43.776
Well, there's bad news about that.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.975
It suddenly stopped working!

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:50.577
It's misbehaving again.

00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:51.097
Yeah.

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:53.059
We didn't break it, it broke itself.

00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:53.759
We did it!

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:54.360
We did it!

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.840
Yeah.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:03.486
You know, Papapabi fixed it so easily, so we thought that we could just do that too, but... We even got out the staff stool.

00:10:03.566 --> 00:10:04.026
Yeah.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.508
No matter what, it wouldn't work.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:11.612
I tried and tried and tried, but... So... No luck.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.233
Once again, I'll be back to chopping veggies and cooking food in the dark for a little bit.

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:19.234
Just a bit.

00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:20.254
Yeah.

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:24.196
At least until we're able to get the courage to change the lightbulb.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:25.357
Yeah.

00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:27.738
BAU BAU.

00:10:27.938 --> 00:10:28.799
But we're strong!

00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:30.379
Strong, right?

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.560
I don't know what it is.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.481
It's really scary changing a lightbulb.

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:34.101
You have to go up high.

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:35.082
I don't want to drop it.

00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:36.242
Right?

00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:39.584
And then the screwdriver goes like... Right?

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.891
Well, Ruffians!

00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:50.712
We have an update!

00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:54.094
Important update.

00:10:54.114 --> 00:10:55.534
I guess it's sort of important.

00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:01.252
We have a Pero Update!

00:11:01.512 --> 00:11:09.440
Ruffians, you might know, but yesterday we went to go find Pero in the backrooms of Fubuki-senpai, right?

00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.383
Fubuki-senpai!

00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:19.230
And thanks to Fubuki-senpai, we were actually able to complete it and make it out of there.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.811
We made it out!

00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:26.174
We really didn't think that would be possible, right, Moco-chan?

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:26.935
No!

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:31.621
No, I really didn't think- Oh, spoilers, spoilers!

00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:32.301
Whoops.

00:11:33.623 --> 00:11:36.126
But did you believe in us, Ruffians?

00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:40.311
But Ruki-senpai believed in us.

00:11:41.552 --> 00:11:43.174
But did the Ruffians believe in us?

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:45.880
Quiz?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.600
No.

00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:47.101
No!

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:50.084
I don't blame you, it's okay.

00:11:50.104 --> 00:11:52.067
You didn't really think it would happen.

00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:53.388
I didn't know.

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:59.475
Yeah, but... The thing about that is... We didn't find Pero, though.

00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:01.297
Yeah, nothing.

00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:10.060
There was just, you know, there were a few things here and there that I thought might have been him for a moment, but it was just my imagination.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.943
You know the little raincoat that ran by?

00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:17.387
It sort of looked round and fluffy, so I thought maybe, maybe it could be him.

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:20.370
I did look around the corner for a bit.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:20.530
Right?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.933
And like there'd be the floaty things that kind of looked white and fuzzy and I thought, oh!

00:12:24.374 --> 00:12:25.355
But it wasn't.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.196
It wasn't him.

00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:31.738
You know, it's a bit frustrating since we went all the way for him.

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:32.639
Twice!

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:32.759
Twice!

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:33.679
Right, Moco-chan?

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:34.960
Ungrateful.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.640
Whatever.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.220
It's fun.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:36.901
It's fun.

00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:44.044
What's more important, I think, than finding Pero is that we're able to find a new friend in there.

00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:45.224
In the back room.

00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:50.288
Fubuki-senpai!

00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:51.429
Not the monster.

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:53.591
Not that friend, no.

00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:58.656
But you know, we're really really happy to be shown around, and so gently too.

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:01.418
Fubuki-senpai was so nice, always praising us.

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:09.305
You know, sometimes I thought that Fubuki-senpai might try to tease us at the beginning, but I realized that wouldn't be the case.

00:13:09.806 --> 00:13:10.706
At first I was like...

00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:16.339
Well, this is Fubuki-seppa's home, right?

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:17.020
Yeah.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.282
So, but... Yeah.

00:13:18.842 --> 00:13:20.064
It was okay.

00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:22.047
But it was a nice ASMR!

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:26.553
I don't know if that's really the best... Not a good idea.

00:13:26.593 --> 00:13:26.893
Yeah.

00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:32.723
We're really happy to play together with Fubuki-senpai.

00:13:33.283 --> 00:13:40.689
We talked about more horror games and that sounds good for training.

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:42.430
Not good for my heart.

00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:46.534
I think we would really like to be able to chat freely together.

00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:52.616
Unfortunately, we couldn't really talk that much.

00:13:52.816 --> 00:13:52.996
Right?

00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.877
We'd get in trouble otherwise.

00:13:55.057 --> 00:13:56.938
Can't have it find us.

00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:02.542
As for Pero, though... Moco-chan, what now?

00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:05.944
If he isn't in the backrooms, then where is he?

00:14:07.204 --> 00:14:17.210
Actually, it does look like a Ruffian spotted him, but... It's not great, Moco-chan.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.691
Where is he now?

00:14:21.306 --> 00:14:24.294
You spotted on Mars?

00:14:33.242 --> 00:14:38.026
I guess in his own words, you know, he's a great Perroccino, right?

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:43.630
So maybe this is normal for him to even travel into space too.

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:45.492
That's pretty impressive.

00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:48.595
But he's on his own now.

00:14:48.635 --> 00:14:51.477
We can't go into space.

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:59.183
Even if you know, even if Pero was in trouble, even if he was crying, maybe not crying.

00:15:00.356 --> 00:15:02.518
Demon Guard Dogs don't go into space.

00:15:02.538 --> 00:15:03.298
We belong on Earth.

00:15:03.318 --> 00:15:05.160
At least two paws on the ground at all times.

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.186
Probably for the best.

00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:26.509
But, you know, I'm not really sure what Pero could be looking for.

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.951
Why is he even going out into space right now?

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.372
What does he want to find?

00:15:30.552 --> 00:15:30.952
Right.

00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:32.193
What is there to find?

00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:33.954
Is there anything to find in space?

00:15:35.655 --> 00:15:38.117
I don't have a good feeling about this, Moco-chan.

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:39.798
He's on his own.

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:44.461
Thank you, Ruffians, for sharing an update with us.

00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:47.923
It's good to know that he's no longer in the backrooms, but...

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.266
Frustrating.

00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:51.667
We worked hard.

00:15:51.887 --> 00:15:52.928
What?

00:15:53.129 --> 00:15:54.770
Ruffians, you saw it, right?

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.452
You know that we worked hard, right?

00:15:57.513 --> 00:15:57.813
Right?

00:16:00.896 --> 00:16:07.503
You know, Ruffians, if you see him again soon, please let us know as soon as you can with the hashtag.

00:16:07.663 --> 00:16:09.605
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.567
BAU BAU!

00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:17.356
Well, it's good that we got up to FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:17.977
Yeah, I guess.

00:16:18.537 --> 00:16:20.219
It's good to have information.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:21.901
Information's always good, yeah.

00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:26.947
It's a bit disappointing, but oh well.

00:16:28.368 --> 00:16:30.070
We've had another...

00:16:31.164 --> 00:16:32.305
Misunderstanding.

00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:38.229
This is a misunderstanding that maybe we should share.

00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:39.049
Try to clear up.

00:16:39.109 --> 00:16:51.998
You know, we feel like maybe after our last Adventures of Cookie and Cream stream, that maybe some Ruffians may have misunderstood something.

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:55.000
You know, we can get really heated, right?

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:03.738
Like, especially during the canoe level, and the level after that, and then the merry-go-round!

00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:05.901
And the flying machine too!

00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:08.003
There was a lot!

00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:09.605
And you know what?

00:17:10.526 --> 00:17:15.272
It may have seemed like we were a bit rough on each other, but you know what?

00:17:17.257 --> 00:17:19.078
Please don't misunderstand, okay?

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:22.060
We're always, always nice to each other.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.481
Even if we're mean to each other.

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:28.345
Because, you know... It makes sense!

00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:30.506
If we're mean to each other, it means we're nice to each other.

00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:31.987
That's what the Ruffians know.

00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:34.969
It's because we're so close, okay?

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.211
So we don't even need to think about...

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.661
That is being mean to each other, you know?

00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:42.302
Get it, Ruffians?

00:17:42.342 --> 00:17:44.003
Yeah, we're just being silly, okay?

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.184
Right, right, yeah.

00:17:45.484 --> 00:17:58.110
So if you ever think, ah, FUWAMOCO is being really rough to each other today, just know that we're good with each other, and we're only like this because we're so comfortable and close, you know?

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.651
Don't worry, okay?

00:17:59.751 --> 00:18:02.632
Yeah, some little squabbling won't get between us, okay?

00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:06.735
And you, Ruffians!

00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:23.809
When you have things like that in your lives where you feel like a fight or something could hurt your relationship with other people who are important to you too, I would like you to think to yourself, is it worth it to potentially hurt my relationship with this person over this?

00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:25.370
Is that important?

00:18:25.491 --> 00:18:27.552
Is it worth being mad or upset over it?

00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:29.173
That's all.

00:18:57.406 --> 00:18:59.487
BAU BAU!

00:18:59.547 --> 00:19:00.747
No more misunderstanding, right?

00:19:00.787 --> 00:19:02.047
We're never angry.

00:19:02.067 --> 00:19:02.848
BAU BAU!

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:15.129
It gets better!

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:17.170
It gets better, right?

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:26.033
No... Moco-chan... Moco-chan... We have a... a confession.

00:19:26.234 --> 00:19:29.715
I really don't think we need to... to do this, you know?

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.956
We don't need to share this with the Ruffians.

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:33.456
This is too personal.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.537
It's unnecessary.

00:19:36.057 --> 00:19:39.579
Moco-chan... I really have to!

00:19:41.957 --> 00:19:43.038
You have to share.

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:44.719
You have to share!

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.301
I think it's probably best to confess.

00:19:50.282 --> 00:19:50.882
You know it.

00:19:53.344 --> 00:19:55.245
I really don't like Moco-chan.

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:57.687
I think it's best.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.289
After FUWAMOCO Mornings, you know it.

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:02.529
Sometimes.

00:20:05.591 --> 00:20:06.492
We go back to sleep.

00:20:09.557 --> 00:20:11.480
It wasn't part of the plan though, okay?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.903
It was never our intention.

00:20:13.423 --> 00:20:13.724
Right.

00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:16.148
You understand, right?

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.151
Right, Ruffians?

00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:22.264
The intention is to start the day together.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.464
And that we get going with a little push.

00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:26.825
Right, right.

00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:27.665
From the Ruffians.

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:28.485
From each other.

00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:32.546
We get the Ruffians a little push, but... We're sorry.

00:20:33.847 --> 00:20:37.048
I know we're supposed to start the day on the right paw!

00:20:37.148 --> 00:20:40.629
And we haven't really been keeping our paw out of the deal, you know.

00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:48.191
This whole time, Ruffians, you've been giving us a push, but you didn't really know that that push was actually towards bed.

00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:48.611
Oops.

00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:54.033
But we've been strong a lot of days, just some nights.

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.313
And a lot of nights.

00:20:56.353 --> 00:21:04.755
By the time we finish the stream things, you know, it's really late and there's other things that we kind of need to get done to come in.

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:09.536
Before you know it, there's only a few hours left before FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:21:09.896 --> 00:21:11.536
Yeah, it's frustrating.

00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:13.297
It's embarrassing.

00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:17.277
Ruffians, don't look at us differently, okay?

00:21:17.297 --> 00:21:18.158
You get it, right?

00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:19.278
It's okay, right?

00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:24.869
We'll do our best to stay awake after FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:27.010
We're really not too good with naps.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.890
No, I don't like naps.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.131
No, we're big sleep people.

00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:35.433
We just can't do the short sleeper sort of things like some of our senpai can.

00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:37.794
I wish we could, but we like our big sleep.

00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:40.095
Yeah, we're just not built the same, okay?

00:21:41.616 --> 00:21:44.197
Demon Guard Dogs need a good sleep too.

00:21:44.397 --> 00:21:46.218
Your image has been broken!

00:21:46.518 --> 00:21:48.039
Please, don't sleep yet.

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:51.230
Don't think differently, okay?

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:55.074
Ruffians, you don't go back to sleep either, right?

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:55.734
Right.

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:56.775
Don't.

00:21:57.195 --> 00:21:57.556
Right.

00:21:57.756 --> 00:22:00.098
And if it's late where you are, do it.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:08.786
It's important for you to sleep if it's late where you are, but if it's early where you are, gotta get going.

00:22:08.886 --> 00:22:11.388
That's the point of FUWAMOCO Morning, you know?

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.391
I don't feel better.

00:22:16.206 --> 00:22:19.510
Thanks Moco-chan, this was all your fault.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.113
You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:22:22.373 --> 00:22:24.275
Let's just go Moco-chan, forget, forget.

00:22:25.056 --> 00:22:26.458
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.380
A good doggy would take my mind off of that.

00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:30.802
Doggie of the Day is...

00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:34.012
Oh!

00:22:34.433 --> 00:22:35.934
Look at this doggy!

00:22:36.374 --> 00:22:38.315
So fluffy!

00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:42.038
And that amazing sleep he must be getting.

00:22:42.098 --> 00:22:43.038
I'm not envious.

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:49.743
I don't know, this face kinda looks like he's definitely around 6 hours into a good rest.

00:22:49.943 --> 00:22:53.986
Getting the Rama sleep, Rama cycle going on.

00:22:56.187 --> 00:22:58.607
It doesn't look like we have a name though.

00:22:58.767 --> 00:22:59.968
Moco-chan is with us!

00:23:00.368 --> 00:23:01.928
What should we name him?

00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:05.829
That's a good face.

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:09.849
A good smiley sleepy face.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:16.891
Well, I feel like it looks like the tongue could just fall out and stay out too.

00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:19.831
Ruffians, do you have any ideas?

00:23:21.792 --> 00:23:22.412
Borgor?

00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:22.632
What?

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.232
Borgon.

00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:28.193
Nemu!

00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:30.074
Cute!

00:23:30.114 --> 00:23:31.355
Nebosuke!

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:32.856
Cute!

00:23:32.876 --> 00:23:33.996
Okay, let's go with those.

00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:35.137
Which one?

00:23:35.617 --> 00:23:35.878
Both.

00:23:36.678 --> 00:23:37.699
There's three.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.582
There's Borgon, Nemu, and Nebosuke.

00:23:42.942 --> 00:23:43.842
Nebosuke.

00:23:43.942 --> 00:23:46.424
Okay, Nebosuke!

00:23:47.244 --> 00:23:52.508
Well, maybe Nebosuke, maybe it's not so much of a BAU BAU this time, but how does Nebosuke snore then?

00:23:54.312 --> 00:23:59.756
There's definitely a mouth open here, so I know that Nobosuke likes to sleep with the mouth open.

00:24:01.658 --> 00:24:02.698
Wait, how does he snore?

00:24:02.798 --> 00:24:04.039
Or how does he BAU BAU?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.960
How does he snore?

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.601
No BAU BAU.

00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:16.449
Oh, of course.

00:24:16.469 --> 00:24:17.650
Sounds a bit angry.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.271
It's like that.

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:24.717
I see Nebosuke-san exactly like that.

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:26.819
Does that sound right?

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:32.104
Nebosuke is very fluffy.

00:24:33.165 --> 00:24:37.930
And I kinda think the more fluff, the better a friend to help you fall asleep is.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.670
What about fuzz?

00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:40.092
Fuzz?

00:24:40.772 --> 00:24:41.013
Fuzz?

00:24:41.093 --> 00:24:42.274
Not as good.

00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:49.137
But you know, actually, we gotta be careful looking at the face.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:52.506
Or maybe we'll start to want to go back to sleep.

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:57.903
But you know, good doggy, good ruff.

00:24:57.983 --> 00:24:59.664
But no more naps for today.

00:24:59.684 --> 00:25:01.146
Our day is starting.

00:25:01.206 --> 00:25:02.007
No more napping.

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:02.707
Uh-uh.

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.468
No more napping.

00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:04.189
Day is starting.

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:04.889
Yeah.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.432
BAU BAU!

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:13.137
That didn't really help us take our mind off the question just now, did we?

00:25:13.818 --> 00:25:14.038
Ruff!

00:25:14.198 --> 00:25:14.398
Ruff!

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:15.900
Where are we going?

00:25:17.205 --> 00:25:18.286
Hoi!

00:25:18.306 --> 00:25:18.366
Wow!

00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:21.608
Rainbow!

00:25:21.628 --> 00:25:22.328
Pretty!

00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:28.772
That's great that you're able to put yourself outside on such a rainy and cold day.

00:25:28.953 --> 00:25:35.777
It looks like it was well worth it being able to see such a gorgeous rainbow in that one!

00:25:35.997 --> 00:25:42.261
Moco-chan, we always want to go on walks together, but it's rough when it's nasty, right?

00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:43.662
I don't want to get wet.

00:25:44.224 --> 00:25:49.127
Yeah, and then it's just like cloudy, and cold, and maybe windy.

00:25:49.267 --> 00:25:57.692
It should go outside by... But you know, we're really glad you're able to get yourself going outside despite that.

00:25:57.832 --> 00:26:00.714
I feel like it's so rare to see a good rainbow nowadays too.

00:26:01.174 --> 00:26:05.396
It's sort of magical, exciting, you know?

00:26:06.177 --> 00:26:09.979
But rainbow or not, a good walk always lives the spirit.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.702
BAU BAU!

00:26:13.902 --> 00:26:16.804
Thank you for sharing your walk with us.

00:26:16.844 --> 00:26:18.845
Let's go outside even if it's cold, okay?

00:26:18.865 --> 00:26:20.847
Yeah, even if we're sleepy too.

00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:21.167
BAU BAU!

00:26:26.371 --> 00:26:27.512
Our Question of the Day.

00:26:27.532 --> 00:26:28.552
What kind of question do we have?

00:26:28.572 --> 00:26:29.913
We have... De-den!

00:26:31.274 --> 00:26:37.777
If you didn't become Demon Guard Dogs, what other career would you two have studied for?

00:26:37.817 --> 00:26:40.058
I can't imagine Fuwawa being an accountant.

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:40.859
Oh, you can!

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.061
Ruffians, would you like me to be your accountant?

00:26:47.313 --> 00:26:47.934
Numbers.

00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:51.762
Fuwawa will take care of the numbers for you.

00:26:52.163 --> 00:26:52.924
You're good!

00:26:54.106 --> 00:26:54.647
You're good!

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.551
Yes, yes.

00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:01.632
Please no.

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.515
Well, if you said please, then... I guess.

00:27:05.636 --> 00:27:11.381
Well, for us, you know, we both feel that being Demon Guard Dogs is our calling, you know?

00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:13.363
And protecting your smile is our job.

00:27:13.383 --> 00:27:16.927
We both feel very dedicated to... Dedication.

00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:21.574
I feel really lucky to be able to do this and it's really fun too!

00:27:21.614 --> 00:27:23.476
You're smiling!

00:27:24.057 --> 00:27:30.082
But actually, originally me, me, Fuwawa, I wanted to get into business.

00:27:31.095 --> 00:27:34.356
Yeah, I wanted to be my own boss.

00:27:34.436 --> 00:27:36.096
Do something really cool, you know.

00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:37.136
Flower boss.

00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:39.877
Like wear those pantsuits, you know.

00:27:40.697 --> 00:27:42.518
I mean business.

00:27:43.058 --> 00:27:48.379
But, Ruffians, as you might kinda know, I'm terrible at math.

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:53.700
So, that's actually why I studied so, so, so, so hard.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.461
Yeah, it took up all of my time.

00:27:57.915 --> 00:28:02.617
There was a lot of late nights and even more tears too.

00:28:03.657 --> 00:28:07.479
And that was really so just so I could be able to study business.

00:28:07.579 --> 00:28:09.580
And I did get pretty far!

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.581
Actually, I got really, really, really far.

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:18.178
I was just one class away, but then I couldn't pass it.

00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:22.904
And no matter how much I studied, I just didn't understand the concepts.

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:27.030
So then everyone told me I should find another dream.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:27.971
Yeah.

00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:29.892
But, you know what?

00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:34.293
I don't regret it because now I'm here with you.

00:28:35.494 --> 00:28:43.095
And I'm able to do this, so... I'm happy, but I don't want other people to dissuade you from your dreams, okay?

00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:44.295
Just keep at it!

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:48.636
But please also remember what's best for you, Ruffians, too.

00:28:49.357 --> 00:28:50.477
As for me, Mococo...

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.631
I don't know what I'd be doing.

00:28:54.652 --> 00:29:00.115
If I didn't have your smile to protect, I feel like, knowing me, I'd probably just get locked up in a cell again.

00:29:01.376 --> 00:29:04.298
But, I study too, okay?

00:29:04.598 --> 00:29:06.199
I study really, really hard.

00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:07.280
Even math.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.142
I don't know what for, but I did, okay?

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:12.342
You did, you did.

00:29:12.462 --> 00:29:12.763
Yeah.

00:29:12.883 --> 00:29:13.363
Okay?

00:29:13.483 --> 00:29:14.163
Yeah.

00:29:14.364 --> 00:29:18.886
So don't just think that Fuwawa is the only one that studied, because I studied hard too!

00:29:18.906 --> 00:29:20.107
Yeah.

00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:20.907
Got it!

00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:24.109
BAU BAU!

00:29:24.189 --> 00:29:25.990
Thank you for the question!

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:34.695
Remember, Ruffians, we're always looking for more submissions for Pero Sightings, for Doggie of the Day, questions, and your walks.

00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:40.102
We're really happy if you could submit more and share your everyday with us, you know?

00:29:40.122 --> 00:29:41.203
All you want!

00:29:41.284 --> 00:29:41.384
Do it!

00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:42.085
Right!

00:29:42.445 --> 00:29:44.988
Send us lots of pictures of your doggy, you know?

00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:45.469
BAU BAU!

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.632
Thank you!

00:29:47.692 --> 00:29:49.434
BAU BAU!

00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:51.176
As for our next stream...

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.131
We have...de-den!

00:29:55.612 --> 00:30:00.354
We're going back on our journey in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time!

00:30:00.454 --> 00:30:03.356
It's time to switch on the N64, Moco-chan.

00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:04.236
Switch on.

00:30:04.256 --> 00:30:05.297
Switch on the N64.

00:30:05.417 --> 00:30:06.557
Not the switch.

00:30:06.697 --> 00:30:07.458
Not the switch.

00:30:07.638 --> 00:30:07.898
Yeah.

00:30:08.218 --> 00:30:09.639
Yeah, the switch has a button.

00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:13.100
The N64 has a switch and it makes a nice sound like the poka.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.241
Why does the switch have a button and the N64 have a switch?

00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:20.482
You'll have to take it up with the Nintendo, Miki.

00:30:20.642 --> 00:30:21.642
I will, I will!

00:30:23.103 --> 00:30:27.244
But it's been a little while since our last journey in Zelda.

00:30:27.324 --> 00:30:31.125
But we were able to help the Gorons, you know, reach the Yummy Rocks again.

00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:33.666
We got through Dodongo's Cavern.

00:30:33.826 --> 00:30:34.786
Alright, so...

00:30:35.322 --> 00:30:41.526
I guess that means that this time we're off again on a journey, and we're looking for our next place to go, right?

00:30:42.347 --> 00:30:46.210
I'm not too sure where we're headed, but I'm excited.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.951
BAU BAU!

00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:51.333
Let's take another peek at our schedule.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:31:03.101
Well, tomorrow, right before Mumei-senpai's 3D showcase, we'll be having another FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:31:03.921 --> 00:31:12.223
And, like we said during our collab with Fubuki-senpai, this time, the theme is Japanese oldies!

00:31:12.283 --> 00:31:18.184
Yeah, we're singing only songs from the Showa period, so that's songs that are all before the 1990s.

00:31:18.524 --> 00:31:18.684
Yeah.

00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:25.648
Maybe there's a lot of Ruffians that haven't really listened to all these before.

00:31:25.668 --> 00:31:28.230
There's a lot of really really cool ones.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.611
I don't know what it's gonna be.

00:31:31.012 --> 00:31:32.232
City Pop.

00:31:32.553 --> 00:31:34.234
I don't know if it counts as City Pop.

00:31:34.474 --> 00:31:37.176
We talked to Nerissa about this before.

00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:40.158
But we're gonna be seeing a bunch of our favorites.

00:31:40.338 --> 00:31:47.443
So if you really like it, you can join us for a bit of a nostalgic, but maybe not nostalgic, but nostalgic still.

00:31:48.283 --> 00:31:50.424
FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

00:31:51.064 --> 00:31:57.787
We'll also be finishing off this weekend with a classic and a rather short visual novel from the makers of Clannad.

00:31:58.387 --> 00:32:00.828
Planetarian!

00:32:01.188 --> 00:32:04.569
We'd love it if you could join us and get nice and comfy and cozy.

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:05.750
Comfy and cozy.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.111
Nice way to end the weekend, right?

00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:11.633
BAU BAU!

00:32:12.274 --> 00:32:15.578
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us for today!

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:20.603
We hope you had another good week of mornings with us, FUWAMOCO!

00:32:21.724 --> 00:32:27.831
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:56.491
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:32:56.972 --> 00:33:00.133
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:33:00.193 --> 00:33:02.194
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!</i>

00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:02.774
