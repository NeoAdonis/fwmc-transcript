05:06.841 --> 05:08.862
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:09.523 --> 05:12.945
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.045 --> 05:16.688
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:16.768 --> 05:18.529
BAU BAU!

05:18.589 --> 05:21.791
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.231 --> 05:24.753
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:25.033 --> 05:26.955
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:26.995 --> 05:27.895
BAU BAU!

05:30.137 --> 05:35.281
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:35.581 --> 05:39.845
Thank you for joining us today for our 93rd episode, Ruffians!

05:40.505 --> 05:41.286
BAU BAU!

05:41.306 --> 05:45.869
Are we sure those numbers are correct, Moco-chan?

05:46.490 --> 05:46.950
No.

05:47.571 --> 05:46.950
93?

05:47.911 --> 05:48.251
No.

05:48.551 --> 05:49.952
Oh, actually they're not correct.

05:50.173 --> 05:51.073
They aren't correct.

05:51.113 --> 05:53.415
There's been some specials in between, right?

05:53.435 --> 05:54.816
They have!

05:54.836 --> 05:57.799
So maybe we're at episode 100 today, we just don't know.

06:02.275 --> 06:03.256
BAU BAU!

06:03.356 --> 06:09.324
Thank you Ruffians for waking up bright and early to join us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:09.724 --> 06:14.951
Recently I feel like we've been joined by a bunch of new Ruffians!

06:16.352 --> 06:24.814
So, to explain for you, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:25.094 --> 06:25.694
A.K.A.

06:25.734 --> 06:26.815
FUWAMOCO!

06:27.075 --> 06:30.816
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:31.236 --> 06:36.657
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:37.217 --> 06:42.879
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:43.739 --> 06:45.701
Let's all BAU BAU!

06:46.101 --> 06:47.322
BAU BAU!

06:47.602 --> 06:51.385
To a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:51.906 --> 06:53.667
BAU BAU!

06:54.848 --> 06:55.508
Like that.

06:55.989 --> 06:57.330
Just like that.

06:57.850 --> 07:01.353
Moco-chan, your voice doesn't sound so rough right now.

07:01.633 --> 07:02.654
You sure?

07:03.555 --> 07:05.156
I think so.

07:05.236 --> 07:07.138
Maybe a bit.

07:07.378 --> 07:08.018
BAU BAU!

07:09.600 --> 07:13.682
It's like a... I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

07:13.802 --> 07:17.483
I don't get a little bit scared when you say your introduction now.

07:17.503 --> 07:17.963
So froggy.

07:18.003 --> 07:21.785
Yeah, no more Mococo, please.

07:22.305 --> 07:23.266
Sound better.

07:23.666 --> 07:26.107
You should see how it sounds when I wake up.

07:26.147 --> 07:27.447
Moco-chan, please.

07:27.487 --> 07:28.148
Fuwawa.

07:28.268 --> 07:31.469
Fuwawa, can you turn around?

07:33.616 --> 07:36.098
It's another FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:36.118 --> 07:40.001
And the week is coming to a close already!

07:40.481 --> 07:42.342
You know, it's the weekend soon.

08:03.717 --> 08:07.259
But there was another peron sighting.

08:07.279 --> 08:13.343
There's been a lot of this recently, Ruffians.

08:13.863 --> 08:16.805
How do you feel when you see Pero, huh?

08:17.766 --> 08:19.346
That's a good question.

08:19.406 --> 08:19.867
Right?

08:21.488 --> 08:22.448
Beloved.

08:23.089 --> 08:23.729
Beloved?

08:23.749 --> 08:25.270
That's how you feel?

08:25.310 --> 08:25.970
Believing?

08:26.010 --> 08:27.792
Your heart feels full?

08:28.292 --> 08:29.513
Happy?

08:29.593 --> 08:30.333
Ruffians!

08:30.633 --> 08:31.034
Magical!

08:33.066 --> 08:33.627
Concern.

08:34.087 --> 08:36.349
Yes, that is the right feeling.

08:36.790 --> 08:37.450
Concern.

08:37.991 --> 08:38.471
Fear.

08:39.132 --> 08:39.953
Anxiety.

08:39.973 --> 08:42.215
Not nice dog.

08:42.535 --> 08:42.896
Yeah.

08:43.276 --> 08:45.699
Well, let's see what pair was spotted this time.

08:46.299 --> 08:46.920
Let's see.

08:47.841 --> 08:50.804
De-den!

08:52.485 --> 08:54.187
When you were on a walk?

08:54.507 --> 08:55.008
What?

08:59.045 --> 09:02.487
Did you happen to run into Pero unexpectedly?

09:03.187 --> 09:07.230
Or while you were trying to improve your Japanese skills?

09:07.870 --> 09:08.971
Enshashingo.

09:09.031 --> 09:09.851
That's right!

09:09.891 --> 09:11.292
You were walking around!

09:11.832 --> 09:12.973
Wanted poster!

09:13.413 --> 09:13.813
I wish.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.218
But at least you got to remember a new Japanese word!

09:19.318 --> 09:19.798
Ya!

09:19.858 --> 09:20.138
No!

09:20.678 --> 09:22.239
Yarashii!

09:22.439 --> 09:23.540
Nasty!

09:24.480 --> 09:25.061
And look!

09:25.161 --> 09:29.523
You know, he put himself right in front of the garbage too!

09:29.683 --> 09:30.763
That's kind!

09:30.803 --> 09:34.665
You know, now it's easier to put him into the place that he belongs!

09:34.705 --> 09:39.228
That's right!

09:39.288 --> 09:43.770
But if you want to remember another Japanese word because of Peron,

09:45.307 --> 09:48.970
Ah, you could learn Marui!

09:48.990 --> 09:49.470
Round!

09:49.550 --> 09:51.492
Yeah, that was in Shashinko, right?

09:51.532 --> 09:52.833
Oh, it was?

09:53.053 --> 09:54.734
Pero's very round, huh?

09:54.774 --> 09:56.455
Maru maru maru no shike!

09:56.475 --> 09:58.236
Yeah, marui.

09:58.337 --> 09:59.998
Pony, pony.

10:01.223 --> 10:03.084
But into the trash he goes.

10:03.204 --> 10:05.285
Trash!

10:05.325 --> 10:09.028
We hope you're still able to learn lots and lots of stuff.

10:09.048 --> 10:10.348
Still take a lot of photos.

10:10.408 --> 10:11.689
Hopefully you didn't ruin it.

10:11.769 --> 10:12.770
BAU BAU!

10:12.810 --> 10:15.491
BAU BAU!

10:15.712 --> 10:16.712
Don't be mean to Pero.

10:17.753 --> 10:18.613
Ruffians!

10:18.633 --> 10:26.298
I don't know, it seems like you feel a little... You don't feel the right feelings when you see Pero, so we're gonna protect you, okay?

10:26.358 --> 10:27.559
We're gonna protect you.

10:27.779 --> 10:28.139
Yeah.

10:28.239 --> 10:28.859
Got it.

10:28.979 --> 10:29.180
Okay.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.580
Okay, Fuwawa.

10:34.021 --> 10:34.501
Howl!

10:35.022 --> 10:35.944
BAU BAU.

10:36.264 --> 10:38.287
I'm here to protect you!

10:39.069 --> 10:41.272
Ruffians!

10:41.412 --> 10:44.337
Let's forget about Peroncino.

10:44.818 --> 10:45.359
Because!

10:46.732 --> 10:50.255
Something big happened that I know you didn't forget about.

10:50.675 --> 10:54.078
It was Shiori's birthday yesterday!

10:54.398 --> 10:57.321
Happy birthday again, Shiori!

10:57.721 --> 11:02.205
Yes, she had a birthday bash together with all the novelaids over on her channel.

11:02.825 --> 11:06.768
And there was some 3D silliness going on too.

11:06.908 --> 11:07.328
But!

11:07.468 --> 11:07.928
But!

11:08.529 --> 11:10.290
Not just that.

11:10.410 --> 11:17.174
Shiori also released her second cover song of Kyofu All Back!

11:17.254 --> 11:18.075
Yay!

11:18.215 --> 11:18.415
Yay!

11:18.995 --> 11:20.136
Have you listened?

11:20.316 --> 11:21.317
Look at Shiori here.

11:21.377 --> 11:22.478
Oh, she doesn't have a knife.

11:22.538 --> 11:24.079
She has a single scissor.

11:24.459 --> 11:26.020
It's one part of the scissor.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.341
Scissors usually is just a scissor.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.463
Ain't nobody taking a part to clean it.

11:31.263 --> 11:32.745
Yeah, you have to be careful.

11:32.765 --> 11:40.034
Shiori here, I think she's being careful, but... It looks a bit dangerous.

11:40.775 --> 11:42.277
I think everything's going well.

11:42.837 --> 11:44.319
Yeah, just she has to be careful.

11:44.339 --> 11:45.921
It's kind of close to her head.

11:45.961 --> 11:47.543
Maybe you should be careful.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.304
Ah, it's okay.

11:49.505 --> 11:53.047
But as you can see, it's super cute.

11:53.847 --> 11:57.449
The video too, it was really something else.

11:57.649 --> 12:03.752
You know, you have a very cute Shiori, like always, you know, trying to run off to school.

12:04.072 --> 12:05.633
But in a 3D series game!

12:05.713 --> 12:07.614
It was a nice mix, right?

12:07.674 --> 12:08.954
So creative.

12:09.675 --> 12:14.837
At FUWAMOCO, we just really love Shiori singing too!

12:14.877 --> 12:17.058
So we're happy to be able to hear more of it.

12:17.799 --> 12:19.746
But we're gonna be a little bit greedy.

12:19.786 --> 12:21.030
We want to hear more!

12:22.929 --> 12:29.953
Shiori did a really great job, so please check it out.

12:29.973 --> 12:33.055
Also, Biboo has Kyofu on back too.

12:33.276 --> 12:34.436
They're both very different.

12:34.576 --> 12:37.058
One's very Biboo, one's very Shiori.

12:37.078 --> 12:41.261
I love them both.

12:42.082 --> 12:45.224
Also, you know it was Shiori's birthday, right?

12:46.164 --> 12:48.606
And she released some birthday merch!

12:50.227 --> 12:52.128
Yay!

12:52.228 --> 12:54.910
This is Shiori looking really cute.

12:57.451 --> 12:57.852
See?

12:58.552 --> 12:59.973
In the kitchen there.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.455
She'll have her whole tongs and scissors at the same time.

13:04.476 --> 13:05.917
She's cutting up noodles for us.

13:06.657 --> 13:06.977
Right.

13:08.138 --> 13:12.361
Gotta hold the noodles down, make sure they don't slip away while she snip-snaps them.

13:12.741 --> 13:13.962
Don't wiggle away.

13:14.162 --> 13:14.582
Right.

13:15.983 --> 13:17.504
I have times where I do that too.

13:18.803 --> 13:19.943
Yeah?

13:20.023 --> 13:21.464
I don't know about that.

13:21.924 --> 13:27.526
But, well, hopefully Ruffians, you like spending time in the kitchen too.

13:27.766 --> 13:31.208
Because Shiori's merch is so cool!

13:31.368 --> 13:35.649
She has a beautiful acrylic panel of this Shiori here.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.350
Look at how cute!

13:37.370 --> 13:38.530
Kitchen Shiori!

13:38.570 --> 13:40.391
Kitchen Shiori with the apron too!

13:40.471 --> 13:42.512
That's a big window.

13:43.112 --> 13:44.954
Big window behind her.

13:45.414 --> 13:48.517
Yeah, the window in the back.

13:48.577 --> 13:54.342
But she also has some cutlery.

13:54.682 --> 13:57.505
It has a fork and a spoon.

13:58.045 --> 14:04.090
And you won't be able to find these anywhere else because the handles are in the shape of a feather ink brush.

14:04.531 --> 14:07.834
And then they also have Shiori's name engraved on them.

14:08.454 --> 14:10.937
They're so, so, so cute!

14:11.177 --> 14:14.501
I know they look very suitable for eating big pieces of meat!

14:14.801 --> 14:16.923
Except maybe you'll need another knife.

14:17.203 --> 14:19.226
Because you'll probably not want to use the spoon.

14:19.306 --> 14:19.946
Yeah.

14:20.187 --> 14:23.070
I don't really eat meat with a fork and spoon, no.

14:24.251 --> 14:25.471
But you can use the fork!

14:27.733 --> 14:40.340
She also has a very uzi shiori themed shirt and a cute mug with a decoration design that changes when you add hot water to it too.

14:40.621 --> 14:41.541
Moco-chan!

14:41.861 --> 14:46.444
We only have two mugs and they're small and they don't have any designs on them.

14:47.205 --> 14:49.526
We don't need that many mugs, okay?

14:49.546 --> 14:50.667
If we get

14:51.636 --> 14:53.196
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

14:53.216 --> 14:53.496
BAU BAU!

15:13.241 --> 15:16.082
Ah, Shiori said you should not microwave it.

15:16.622 --> 15:17.782
That's kind of her.

15:18.623 --> 15:20.123
Good advice, huh?

15:20.763 --> 15:21.323
Yeah.

15:21.764 --> 15:24.344
But Shiori's wedges are really really cute.

15:24.444 --> 15:26.145
I'm very Shiori.

15:26.625 --> 15:31.567
So we hope that you'll check them out and maybe decide to grow your kitchen cabinet too.

15:32.567 --> 15:33.687
Kitchen cabinet?

15:33.747 --> 15:34.227
Yeah!

15:34.687 --> 15:36.848
Grow it by putting more bugs into it.

15:37.248 --> 15:38.249
Cutlery.

15:38.269 --> 15:39.209
I know.

15:40.362 --> 15:41.223
Okay!

15:41.663 --> 15:44.486
BAU BAU BAU!

15:44.506 --> 15:45.006
Tasty plastic.

15:45.106 --> 15:52.833
There's no plastic, there's only acrylic.

15:52.873 --> 15:53.814
BAU BAU!

15:53.874 --> 15:58.878
Unless Ruffians, you're not using plastic cutlery, are you?

16:07.944 --> 16:11.709
It's time to get some shiori forks and spoons in hand!

16:12.189 --> 16:15.173
BAU BAU!

16:15.273 --> 16:16.595
Well, Ruffians!

16:17.236 --> 16:21.861
Actually, on the topic of cover songs, FUWAMOCO!

16:22.182 --> 16:24.625
We've reached some new milestones of our own!

16:24.845 --> 16:26.868
I think Ruffians

16:27.348 --> 16:31.569
What a song, because we saw a bunch of your congratulations messages.

16:31.629 --> 16:32.509
Thank you!

16:32.689 --> 16:38.631
First, our cover of Speed's song White Love has reached 700,000 views!

16:38.691 --> 16:39.211
BAU BAU!

16:39.271 --> 16:42.112
Thank you!

16:42.432 --> 16:45.553
You know, while it's not at all the famous song in Japan,

16:46.173 --> 16:53.459
It's not so well-known overseas, so... It makes us really happy that you've been listening to our voice!

16:53.579 --> 16:55.601
Thank you, Ruffians!

16:56.561 --> 16:56.822
And!

16:57.402 --> 16:58.143
Also!

16:58.483 --> 17:01.986
Our cover of Kanaya's Identity!

17:02.326 --> 17:03.247
It hit 800,000 views!

17:03.267 --> 17:03.627
BAU BAU!

17:07.049 --> 17:08.910
Thank you, Ruffians!

17:09.411 --> 17:22.677
It really makes us so, so happy to know that you like our singing and our music so much and that you've still been listening to them many, many times over, even months after they've been released.

17:23.077 --> 17:26.959
We hope we can share some new music with you soon, okay?

17:27.439 --> 17:31.641
So make sure that you're super enthusiastic about it when that day comes, okay?

17:31.961 --> 17:32.261
Okay!

17:33.642 --> 17:34.402
BAU BAU!

17:35.543 --> 17:37.464
Yeah, make sure you go listen!

17:37.484 --> 17:45.448
Our most recent cover is Let Me Be With You, too, so maybe for a bit more of a spring vibe, yeah.

17:45.908 --> 17:47.428
You can go listen.

17:47.468 --> 17:48.349
Morning, too.

17:48.409 --> 17:50.290
Right after FUWAMOCO Morning.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.170
Perfect song, too.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.611
BAU BAU!

17:52.651 --> 17:53.831
Wow!

17:58.726 --> 18:00.987
Gosh, Moco-chan, what's the matter?

18:01.007 --> 18:03.648
Did you notice, Ruffians?

18:03.668 --> 18:09.311
That you're getting a little bit more ruff sounding, Moco-chan?

18:09.831 --> 18:10.431
No, no.

18:10.571 --> 18:12.732
Did you notice?

18:12.772 --> 18:15.654
Did you see a dinosaur?

18:17.301 --> 18:20.724
I kinda heard a dinosaur, but I don't think that's what Moco-chan's getting at.

18:20.764 --> 18:21.225
No.

18:24.288 --> 18:25.629
Wow.

18:26.169 --> 18:29.052
Oh, I see a lot of good things, but that's not it.

18:29.072 --> 18:29.112
No.

18:29.512 --> 18:33.476
FUWAMOCO made a few changes over the last few days, right?

18:35.606 --> 18:36.366
Yo!

18:36.766 --> 18:37.727
FUWAMOCO!

18:37.787 --> 18:41.808
We started doing streams with two computers!

18:41.828 --> 18:46.349
Two perspectives on separate PCs!

18:46.969 --> 18:47.429
Yo!

18:47.489 --> 18:48.329
What did you think?

18:48.449 --> 18:49.329
Dual streams!

18:49.409 --> 18:50.089
Yo!

18:51.290 --> 18:59.052
Well, we had our Orodoroke and Weevil Company collab on my desktop computer!

18:59.372 --> 19:04.473
And that was together in the same room at the same time, but earlier we tried it

19:04.893 --> 19:07.915
With me over in a separate room.

19:07.935 --> 19:10.677
Why did you think muffins of Moco-chan are scary?

19:10.917 --> 19:14.259
What did you think?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.861
I was so nervous.

19:16.881 --> 19:20.083
I wanted to call Moco-chan for help.

19:20.723 --> 19:22.324
I can't stop laughing!

19:22.344 --> 19:23.865
This can't be the right...

19:31.473 --> 19:32.716
It's been pretty fun!

19:32.776 --> 19:33.618
It's good!

19:34.139 --> 19:35.523
Fuwawa gaming is great!

19:44.656 --> 19:50.119
Yeah, well, it's been something that we've been trying to kind of test out here and there.

19:50.139 --> 20:00.263
You know, we're hoping that this way you can watch both of our streams and see what both of us are up to in the game.

20:00.543 --> 20:05.065
I think we got some interesting results already!

20:05.346 --> 20:05.906
Yeah!

20:06.306 --> 20:07.126
Right!

20:07.226 --> 20:08.287
You know, and- No!

20:08.327 --> 20:08.807
No!

20:08.827 --> 20:08.927
Right!

20:11.544 --> 20:12.224
No!

20:12.945 --> 20:13.445
What was that?

20:13.865 --> 20:14.706
No!

20:16.106 --> 20:17.727
Huh?

20:19.388 --> 20:20.669
Why did you poke me?

20:22.249 --> 20:23.590
What are you doing?

20:26.412 --> 20:35.196
Say it again.

20:35.957 --> 20:36.497
What?

20:36.597 --> 20:36.817
No.

20:36.917 --> 20:37.177
No!

20:37.217 --> 20:37.397
Don't!

20:37.657 --> 20:39.118
She poked me in the neck.

20:44.016 --> 20:45.937
Why do I keep touching Mococo?

20:45.997 --> 20:46.598
BAU BAU!

20:47.679 --> 20:50.160
What were we talking about?

20:50.240 --> 20:56.405
I was having too much fun with Mococo.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.634
Interesting result!

21:02.694 --> 21:04.034
That's right!

21:04.254 --> 21:10.156
Well, you know, we think that depending on the type of game that we'll probably change things up a little bit.

21:10.197 --> 21:11.397
Maybe sometimes I'm behind.

21:11.717 --> 21:12.577
Beside, not behind.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.578
Beside Moco-chan!

21:14.958 --> 21:18.720
Or away, but I hope that you enjoyed it.

21:18.780 --> 21:26.203
You know, it's a bit different, you know, being able to see us run around and do things and act on our own, right?

21:26.223 --> 21:26.863
It's cool!

21:27.983 --> 21:33.005
I get to hug Moco-chan in content morning!

21:33.865 --> 21:42.108
But we'll be streaming both our perspectives at the same time again on Saturday for our first start to our Minecraft journey as well.

21:42.148 --> 21:46.910
So maybe if you're a little curious about how does this all work, you can come and join us.

21:47.710 --> 21:49.451
It'll be fun!

21:49.511 --> 21:51.831
We need you to hold our paws too, okay?

21:51.891 --> 21:55.233
Because we have no clue what we're doing in Minecraft.

21:55.253 --> 21:55.373
Okay?

21:57.294 --> 21:59.938
BAU BAU!

22:02.181 --> 22:02.922
New world!

22:03.043 --> 22:03.804
New world!

22:03.924 --> 22:05.566
All from the very beginning.

22:08.809 --> 22:10.510
We really need to help Ruffians.

22:10.971 --> 22:12.712
But it'll be fun!

22:13.493 --> 22:14.974
BAU BAU!

22:15.074 --> 22:16.855
And also good luck to the Ruffians.

22:17.716 --> 22:20.358
Try not to go too cross-eyed, okay?

22:20.779 --> 22:25.662
We'll try to make things easier when we can, but sometimes it might be a little bit tricky.

22:25.763 --> 22:28.865
It's a learning process, too.

22:29.145 --> 22:32.988
But we'll make sure that it can be a good experience for you as well, too.

22:33.028 --> 22:33.649
BAU BAU!

22:36.986 --> 22:52.036
Well, for Ruffians who are following us over on Twitter, you might have seen, but I asked you for some suggestions on things to get Moco-chan healthy and maybe to make her dough feel a little bit better too.

22:53.277 --> 23:00.141
Of course, Ruffians, you gave me a bunch of great answers, so I want to say thank you!

23:00.622 --> 23:03.784
And I got a bunch of them, but one in particular

23:05.532 --> 23:11.878
So, uh, by the end, I want to go get groceries just for Moco-chan here.

23:12.558 --> 23:12.678
And...

23:13.624 --> 23:18.888
I was gonna get umeboshi pickle pops especially just for Moco-chan.

23:18.908 --> 23:19.948
Yeah.

23:20.349 --> 23:21.049
Umeboshi!

23:21.129 --> 23:23.111
Yeah!

23:23.291 --> 23:23.871
Ume!

23:23.891 --> 23:23.951
Ume!

23:25.012 --> 23:28.114
And you know, the store they have a bunch of different umeboshi.

23:28.134 --> 23:29.215
They all look delicious.

23:29.255 --> 23:32.437
Some are cheaper, some are more expensive.

23:32.457 --> 23:34.719
So I had a hard time deciding on which one to get.

23:34.739 --> 23:37.721
But I finally made up my mind.

23:37.741 --> 23:40.583
And then when I turned around,

23:41.747 --> 23:48.530
I just happened to find some really, really delicious looking umeboshi on another shelf behind me.

23:48.550 --> 23:52.471
It wasn't in the refrigerated area, but I should have been going.

23:52.811 --> 23:55.892
But, but, but, they look delicious, you know?

23:55.912 --> 23:59.914
It just looked like a lot of them in comparison to the five in the pack.

24:00.454 --> 24:07.497
So, I decided to get that one instead and I put away the other umeboshi I was gonna get and I was gonna get the delicious looking ones.

24:10.253 --> 24:13.815
And that's when it happened.

24:13.915 --> 24:17.598
I got back, and I showed what I got Otsumoko-chan.

24:17.918 --> 24:20.120
And then of course, I really like umeboshi.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.941
We both really like umeboshi.

24:22.281 --> 24:25.743
So I was really excited to try the delicious looking ones.

24:26.304 --> 24:30.867
And so I kind of went ahead and opened them up to try one myself first.

24:40.197 --> 24:45.702
Ruffians!

24:45.782 --> 24:53.508
What I bought were Ume plums.

24:53.829 --> 24:57.352
Plums that have been used previously to make plum wine.

24:58.433 --> 25:04.518
And, well, it was alcoholic and apparently delicious to some, but...

25:05.865 --> 25:06.065
No.

25:06.586 --> 25:06.786
No.

25:07.286 --> 25:07.486
No.

25:07.667 --> 25:07.967
No.

25:08.227 --> 25:10.068
I was so disappointed.

25:11.309 --> 25:13.211
It wasn't at all what I wanted.

25:13.231 --> 25:18.535
And they smelled super alcoholic and really spicy!

25:19.196 --> 25:19.976
And it was 5.30am!

25:20.197 --> 25:22.719
It was really early.

25:22.979 --> 25:23.539
Yeah.

25:24.380 --> 25:30.965
And Ruffians, I was a little bit surprised too because a lot of you were saying that we should eat them.

25:32.146 --> 25:32.566
Eat them.

25:34.068 --> 25:34.248
But...

25:35.805 --> 25:36.525
Ruffians!

25:37.466 --> 25:39.007
What are you suggesting?

25:39.127 --> 25:39.927
You know it.

25:40.348 --> 25:41.808
We're demon dogs.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.649
Yeah, we don't drink alcohol.

25:43.729 --> 25:44.370
You know it.

25:44.850 --> 25:48.952
Plus, it's really spicy and it smells bad and it's not good for you.

25:49.012 --> 25:52.574
Yeah, we'd much rather have something else, you know, like pond or rain.

25:52.594 --> 25:53.575
Yeah.

25:55.956 --> 26:02.242
Yeah, so some Ruffians do remember that demon dogs know no alcohol.

26:02.583 --> 26:06.086
So you suggested that maybe we give them to a senpai.

26:06.767 --> 26:12.472
So, actually, that's what we did.

26:13.733 --> 26:18.058
We're the kind of silly demon guide dog sisters that then

26:19.131 --> 26:29.016
After, you know, we finish playing Touhou with Marine-senchou-senpai, we open up our bag and we... Here's a tub of umeshu!

26:29.036 --> 26:33.559
Ume plums, Marine-senchou-senpai!

26:33.859 --> 26:37.441
This is why we have them, and... Yeah.

26:37.821 --> 26:38.962
If you want them.

26:39.982 --> 26:40.423
Yeah.

26:41.143 --> 26:44.925
Hopefully she didn't think we were too silly.

26:45.625 --> 26:46.406
Hopefully!

26:48.694 --> 26:51.257
She said that she was going to enjoy them on rice.

26:51.357 --> 26:52.038
Yes!

26:52.198 --> 26:56.043
But... How are you supposed to eat them?

26:56.123 --> 26:56.703
I don't know.

26:56.864 --> 26:58.345
How are you supposed to eat them?

26:58.405 --> 27:00.087
I think they're supposed to be a snack.

27:01.069 --> 27:02.550
Maybe she thought they were umeboshi too.

27:04.733 --> 27:09.796
I'm not sure, but hopefully she likes them either way.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.838
BAU BAU!

27:14.198 --> 27:15.659
I think you have them just raw.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.440
I think it's supposed to be like a snack.

27:18.241 --> 27:18.721
I don't know.

27:18.781 --> 27:20.942
I don't know if you're supposed to have them on rice.

27:21.062 --> 27:22.743
We weren't supposed to buy them.

27:22.843 --> 27:23.904
We weren't, no!

27:24.584 --> 27:27.706
Hopefully she likes them though.

27:28.506 --> 27:29.967
BAU BAU!

27:31.888 --> 27:34.589
Yeah, we're gonna be that cool high high.

27:35.489 --> 27:36.790
BAU BAU.

27:37.190 --> 27:37.650
BAU!

27:38.010 --> 27:39.111
Actually, Ruffians!

27:39.671 --> 27:43.032
We got a scoop from a Ruffian!

27:43.112 --> 27:44.532
BAU BAU!

27:44.572 --> 27:50.154
Thank you so much to Tom8O for the impeccable journalism!

27:50.734 --> 27:52.295
Wow, Ruffians.

27:53.015 --> 27:57.961
It sounds like there's a brand new Earth Defense Force game coming out.

27:57.981 --> 28:01.224
But not just that, that alone is very exciting.

28:01.585 --> 28:08.552
But our wonderful senpai, Kiara-senpai, Gura-senpai, Ayame-senpai, they're all gonna be a part of it!

28:08.913 --> 28:10.554
BAU BAU!

28:11.315 --> 28:12.276
So excited!

28:12.356 --> 28:19.020
Yeah, it looks like there's gonna be decoy balloons or something to distract or attract the aliens.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.202
Maybe they'll have voice lines or something too.

28:22.843 --> 28:28.947
I think so, you know, you could hear IRyS-senpai singing the song and stuff.

28:29.227 --> 28:30.227
EDF!

28:30.488 --> 28:30.768
EDF!

28:30.848 --> 28:32.989
It was so cool!

28:33.309 --> 28:35.191
We're so happy for them!

28:35.831 --> 28:37.911
We're a little envious too, huh?

28:37.931 --> 28:41.832
We want to be in the game too!

28:42.172 --> 28:48.314
Well, you know, we'll just have to make sure that all together with Advent we play the new EDF together.

28:49.194 --> 28:55.475
Maybe we can get our paws on our senpai and put them to test in battle!

28:55.515 --> 28:57.156
We'll make sure to be nice to them.

28:58.736 --> 29:00.358
BAU BAU!

29:00.378 --> 29:00.798
So cool!

29:00.878 --> 29:01.479
EDF!

29:01.839 --> 29:02.560
EDF!

29:02.640 --> 29:04.021
BAU BAU!

29:04.041 --> 29:04.361
BAU BAU!

29:19.704 --> 29:23.066
Let's take a look at who our Doggie of the Day is today!

29:23.086 --> 29:31.412
Our Doggie of the Day today is... Today's client!

29:32.153 --> 29:33.734
So round!

29:33.814 --> 29:34.114
Morning!

29:34.235 --> 29:34.795
Morning!

29:38.177 --> 29:39.718
You look like a puppy pillow.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.599
A puppy pillow, right?

29:41.919 --> 29:49.983
Yeah, uh, Ruffians, you might be able to kind of tell, but Five loves to burn his face into his donut down.

29:50.003 --> 29:52.184
Ah, it's so cute!

29:52.485 --> 29:52.625
Right?

29:52.905 --> 29:58.107
But, uh, as for FUWAMOCO, burning our faces into donuts.

29:58.948 --> 29:59.868
You know what, baby?

29:59.908 --> 30:05.151
Be careful, because you don't want to get too fluffy upon the ring.

30:06.031 --> 30:06.412
Yeah.

30:06.432 --> 30:07.192
Maybe not like that.

30:07.998 --> 30:08.418
Yeah.

30:09.858 --> 30:11.179
But that's okay!

30:11.199 --> 30:14.820
There's lots of climbs to climb!

30:14.980 --> 30:16.600
Puppy Paralyzed!

30:16.740 --> 30:20.121
I wonder what happens if you just put your hand on climb.

30:20.141 --> 30:23.102
Maybe it'll leave a bit of a hand print.

30:24.062 --> 30:27.023
So fun!

30:27.263 --> 30:30.223
But climb is apparently also very silly.

30:30.243 --> 30:31.964
Can you tell, Moco-chan?

30:32.344 --> 30:32.684
I can tell.

30:38.326 --> 30:40.489
How does Clive BAU BAU?

30:40.849 --> 30:46.596
I think he's a quick BAU BAU.

30:47.317 --> 30:50.020
Like really quick so that Clive can eat the donuts faster.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.327
Clive likes donuts.

30:58.787 --> 30:59.968
We like donuts.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.629
Clive is silly.

31:02.429 --> 31:03.450
We are silly.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.431
Clive is very fluffy.

31:06.191 --> 31:07.152
FUWAMOCO.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.974
We're fluffy, but not that fluffy.

31:11.254 --> 31:11.674
No.

31:11.935 --> 31:12.715
Fluffy vomit.

31:13.936 --> 31:15.277
Great job, Clive!

31:15.317 --> 31:16.417
Great job!

31:16.437 --> 31:18.919
Let's go for donuts sometime, okay?

31:19.479 --> 31:21.500
BAU BAU!

31:21.680 --> 31:21.940
BAU BAU!

31:24.530 --> 31:25.831
Don't get too fluffy.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.293
A clown can't get behind fluffy.

31:28.753 --> 31:33.497
BAU BAU!

31:34.157 --> 31:37.259
Ruffians, you're still getting up and going for walks, right?

31:37.840 --> 31:40.482
Let's take a look at where you've been walking around.

31:41.282 --> 31:43.884
De-den!

31:44.065 --> 31:45.666
Such a blue sky!

31:45.726 --> 31:49.028
What a beautiful day to go for a walk!

31:49.048 --> 31:54.052
The island is the railroad too.

31:54.353 --> 31:59.977
It's nice that you're able to enjoy this walk here since it sounds like you can't really do it during evening.

31:59.997 --> 32:01.418
It's peaceful.

32:02.919 --> 32:03.479
FUWAMOCO!

32:18.379 --> 32:22.363
Well, we hope that you'll be able to enjoy lots and lots of biking too.

32:22.804 --> 32:26.608
Maybe that's something that you can keep special for the summer time.

32:26.708 --> 32:29.191
You know, once it gets warmer.

32:29.791 --> 32:30.852
Have fun!

32:30.993 --> 32:32.294
Have fun biking!

32:32.354 --> 32:33.655
BAU BAU!

32:33.856 --> 32:35.437
Walk along the side of it.

32:35.858 --> 32:36.558
Side of it.

32:37.499 --> 32:41.820
Moco-chan, did we get a question today?

32:42.061 --> 32:46.302
My Question of the Day is... De-den!

32:47.202 --> 32:52.244
I think your interest in the Japanese language was largely influenced by anime and songs.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.905
What were some of the benefits you received from learning?

32:57.765 --> 33:06.611
You know, FUWAMOCO, well, we first really liked anime and games, and that's kinda how we got interested in Japan and learning Japanese.

33:07.031 --> 33:17.599
But, you know, just because you like those kind of things doesn't mean that you need to go out of your way and learn the language too, because there's translations into your own language, right?

33:18.059 --> 33:18.599
Right.

33:19.120 --> 33:25.704
But, there was a time, you know, when we really wanted to go to Japan one day, cause you know, it'd be fun, it'd be cool.

33:25.784 --> 33:26.264
Yeah.

33:26.545 --> 33:26.805
And then,

33:27.165 --> 33:31.810
Well, we kind of thought about, oh, I won't be able to communicate.

33:32.591 --> 33:35.755
And then you'd need a translator with you everywhere you go.

33:37.025 --> 33:39.605
That was kind of a bit frustrating to us.

33:40.266 --> 33:42.746
So that's when we started learning.

33:43.186 --> 33:48.807
But I think more than anything though, learning Japanese has really opened up our world.

33:49.167 --> 33:59.549
You know, we've learned and gained so many things, met so many people, and we're just so fortunate that we can speak and understand both English and Japanese.

34:00.569 --> 34:01.510
Right?

34:01.610 --> 34:03.030
And yes, unfortunately,

34:04.031 --> 34:11.339
Even though it doesn't really help out too much in our everyday nowadays now that we're outside in the Makai, but yeah.

34:11.679 --> 34:12.280
It's good!

34:12.360 --> 34:12.840
It's good!

34:13.040 --> 34:14.902
Yes!

34:14.922 --> 34:16.144
So Ruffian!

34:16.244 --> 34:16.724
Good luck!

34:17.085 --> 34:18.667
Shashingo was really fun!

34:18.707 --> 34:19.227
Yeah!

34:19.267 --> 34:20.068
It was good!

34:20.088 --> 34:24.172
And there were words like yarashii and marui and... Ninjyago.

34:24.913 --> 34:26.674
That wasn't in the game.

34:27.155 --> 34:28.816
BAU BAU!

34:28.916 --> 34:31.617
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions.

34:31.917 --> 34:38.421
We're looking for your questions, your Doggie of the Day, your walks, your pero sightings.

34:38.822 --> 34:41.023
Really, really, anything comes into mind.

34:41.463 --> 34:43.905
Please tweet using the hashtag.

34:44.225 --> 34:48.648
Hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

34:48.848 --> 34:50.709
Okay, you understand, right?

34:51.229 --> 34:52.029
Morning!

34:52.630 --> 34:54.430
We're always looking, okay?

34:54.870 --> 34:56.831
BAU BAU!

34:57.251 --> 35:01.693
Well, later this evening we have a stream coming up, right Moco-chan?

35:01.733 --> 35:02.853
We do!

35:03.393 --> 35:05.954
Next we have de-den.

35:05.974 --> 35:07.315
Aoi Oni.

35:07.455 --> 35:07.655
Yawn.

35:17.358 --> 35:19.900
I'm a demon dog and I'm blue.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.822
I'm not an Ao Oni.

35:24.303 --> 35:31.289
But it does bring in the question because we have to go find our sister and escape the Ao Oni.

35:31.309 --> 35:35.512
Are we sure that the sister isn't the Ao Oni?

35:36.513 --> 35:36.993
We don't know.

35:37.013 --> 35:45.100
But we're gonna do our best in a brand new remake of the classic retro horror game, indie game.

35:46.408 --> 35:48.490
We're looking forward to it, huh Moco-chan?

35:48.510 --> 35:51.472
We watched a little bit of the old album before, right Fu?

35:51.553 --> 35:52.493
Am I alright?

35:55.496 --> 35:55.936
No.

35:56.177 --> 35:57.758
I watched videos of the old one.

35:57.938 --> 36:01.141
A long time ago.

36:01.201 --> 36:01.501
Yeah.

36:01.982 --> 36:04.344
I just remember screaming on my own.

36:04.364 --> 36:06.145
Good luck Moco-chan.

36:07.876 --> 36:09.297
BAU BAU!

36:09.357 --> 36:14.181
Let's take another peek at our schedule here.

36:14.201 --> 36:19.906
Our schedule of Golden Week is coming to an end, but we still have a lot of fun things planned.

36:19.946 --> 36:27.312
FUWAMOCO, we played Shashinko, but we're gonna continue our Japanese study a little bit by playing some more Kanji Dego.

36:27.372 --> 36:28.092
Last time we made

36:30.314 --> 36:31.474
It was a good study.

36:31.514 --> 36:32.795
We learned some new words.

36:32.955 --> 36:33.975
What the update is?

36:34.055 --> 36:37.236
Not futa-megane, sou-gankyo, binoculars.

36:37.376 --> 36:39.116
But yeah, the update!

36:39.576 --> 36:40.737
I don't know how we're gonna do.

36:40.757 --> 36:43.797
Maybe we made it a little bit more yasashii.

36:43.937 --> 36:45.378
A bit easier.

36:45.978 --> 36:47.018
Intermediate.

36:47.298 --> 36:47.778
Right.

36:48.138 --> 36:50.299
But we'll check it out together!

36:50.619 --> 36:54.080
And then later we have our FUWAMOCO Minecraft journey.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.520
Finally it's gonna be starting!

36:57.000 --> 36:58.901
What kind of adventures are we gonna have?

36:59.361 --> 37:03.184
FUWAMOCO Maybe you have a better idea than us.

37:04.064 --> 37:07.827
And then we have our first collab ever with Wondame-senpai!

37:07.867 --> 37:11.650
We're gonna be playing some clubhouse games.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.792
Battle between Fluffy and Fuzzy and a Fluffy.

37:14.812 --> 37:16.533
We'll see who wins.

37:17.374 --> 37:23.978
And then on the weekend, to end off the weekend, with the doggy pack, we're gonna be playing Fall Guys!

37:25.479 --> 37:36.204
Like we promised the other day, we're gonna open up the live chat two hours beforehand so that you can get some practice and beat us up even more, okay?

37:39.418 --> 37:41.500
BAU BAU!

37:41.920 --> 37:44.402

38:04.586 --> 38:05.588

38:05.628 --> 38:11.038
You're gonna open up the live chat and then sleep, Moco-chan!

38:11.058 --> 38:11.298
No.

38:15.589 --> 38:17.631
