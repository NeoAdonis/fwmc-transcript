06:30.632 --> 06:32.854
BAU BAU!

06:33.895 --> 06:37.138
BAU BAU!

06:37.158 --> 06:42.882
I don't know, I have a feeling that today is a very beautiful way to end off the week.

06:42.982 --> 06:43.322
Right.

06:43.723 --> 06:45.964
And we're going to a wonderful weekend.

06:46.084 --> 06:46.705
Yay!

06:46.725 --> 06:50.248
Let's all have a wonderful day, Ruffians!

06:51.248 --> 06:52.469
FUWAMOCO-chan!

06:52.970 --> 06:55.251
There is something that wasn't so beautiful.

06:59.455 --> 07:00.275
Ruffians.

07:03.497 --> 07:08.041
Now what is... Yeah, another... Pero Sighting.

07:10.743 --> 07:12.444
Let's see where he is this time!

07:12.464 --> 07:13.805
I can't get away from him.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.347
Okay.

07:18.048 --> 07:18.909
Down.

07:20.490 --> 07:20.830
A cake!

07:21.536 --> 07:23.137
For us!

07:24.037 --> 07:25.578
Cute!

07:26.118 --> 07:28.359
But, oh, what a surprise.

07:28.939 --> 07:30.680
Pero emerged from the fog.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.761
I'll hang up this cake and eat the decorations.

07:33.781 --> 07:35.762
Well, that's not very nice of him.

07:36.222 --> 07:43.145
But, well, actually, I kind of feel like it looks like he perfectly fits there, no?

07:44.066 --> 07:50.909
Ah, well, I guess, unfortunately for him, you know, he fits there.

07:51.598 --> 07:52.979
Huh?

07:53.019 --> 07:53.779
Ruffians!

07:54.440 --> 07:57.241
Where do you want to start eating the cake from?

07:57.742 --> 07:58.782
Yeah.

07:59.623 --> 08:00.863
Right.

08:03.365 --> 08:04.646
From his face?

08:05.346 --> 08:06.987
From the peron!

08:08.308 --> 08:09.949
Eat the peron!

08:09.969 --> 08:11.670
From the right of his eye!

08:12.030 --> 08:13.230
The ears!

08:13.551 --> 08:14.371
The tummy!

08:14.511 --> 08:18.674
Yeah, I think the tummy sticks a knife right in there!

08:21.595 --> 08:28.217
Well, unfortunately, I guess for Pero, he kind of made the worst decision on where to pop out from, huh?

08:28.297 --> 08:30.798
You picked the wrong cake to start, Pero!

08:31.678 --> 08:32.739
Yeah.

08:33.619 --> 08:35.359
Especially an ice cream cake!

08:35.840 --> 08:38.400
One that was made especially for us two.

08:39.521 --> 08:41.421
Why would you go into an ice cream cake?

08:41.541 --> 08:42.662
That's cold, huh?

08:42.882 --> 08:43.742
I guess it's delicious, but...

08:45.161 --> 08:47.602
Thank you so much for the cake!

08:48.102 --> 08:50.984
It looks both delicious and lovely!

08:51.244 --> 08:54.327
Hope you enjoy cutting Pero into pieces and eating him!

08:54.467 --> 08:55.908
Eating him... BAU BAU!

08:55.948 --> 08:57.008
BAU BAU!

09:07.158 --> 09:08.959
Wow, Ruffians!

09:09.459 --> 09:15.161
You know, I just, I feel so happy because I feel like every FUWAMOCO Morning we could do it.

09:15.261 --> 09:18.362
Right, we have something super happy to share with you.

09:18.882 --> 09:25.465
Well, this time Ruffians, we hit another huge milestone!

09:25.625 --> 09:26.925
We now have over 700! 500!

09:31.247 --> 09:34.869
750,000 Ruffians here on YouTube!

09:35.249 --> 09:39.771
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

09:40.191 --> 09:43.992
So many Ruffians, it's hard for me to say it properly.

09:44.012 --> 09:45.553
I keep on saying 150,000, it's hard.

09:45.733 --> 09:51.736
It's too big of a number now, Ruffians!

09:52.276 --> 09:54.117
BAU BAU!

09:54.297 --> 09:59.379
Thank you so much for all your love and support during these past six months.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.174
I don't know.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.677
How are we already at this milestone?

10:05.137 --> 10:06.718
I'm so surprised.

10:07.779 --> 10:08.159
You know what?

10:08.219 --> 10:09.400
It's a huge one, right?

10:10.080 --> 10:14.083
You know when we debuted, we had that one goal, right?

10:14.103 --> 10:16.125
Do you remember?

10:16.145 --> 10:17.826
Do you remember, Ruffian?

10:20.840 --> 10:23.442
1 million subscribers within 1 year.

10:23.502 --> 10:25.383
Yeah, 1 year from debut.

10:25.863 --> 10:27.444
Maybe it surprised you a bit.

10:28.245 --> 10:31.387
But you know Ruffians, we're hungry puppies.

10:32.147 --> 10:36.470
And you know now we're 6 months, almost 7 months since debut.

10:38.225 --> 10:42.486
We're continuing to do our best, you know, reach that big goal.

10:42.786 --> 10:48.728
But like we've always said, you know, more than anything, it's the journey that's important, right?

10:49.348 --> 10:51.168
It really, really is.

10:52.669 --> 10:57.050
We think that so far, it's been a very beautiful journey.

10:58.270 --> 11:00.391
And that's what matters most, right?

11:01.257 --> 11:05.761
Yeah, we really hope, Ruffians, that you'll continue to have lots of fun with us.

11:06.182 --> 11:10.806
And that maybe even more Ruffians will decide to join us along the way, too.

11:11.126 --> 11:11.927
Yeah!

11:12.587 --> 11:15.330
Let's all BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:15.530 --> 11:17.832
Onto 1 million Ruffians!

11:17.852 --> 11:19.354
1 million BAU BAUs!

11:19.374 --> 11:20.895
1 million BAU BAUs!

11:20.915 --> 11:23.598
Oh no, is that what we're gonna have to do, Moco-chan?

11:23.738 --> 11:23.958
Oh no.

11:26.958 --> 11:30.239
I just did it to ourselves.

11:30.259 --> 11:33.740
1 million Ruffians.

11:34.141 --> 11:35.401
1 million BAU BAUs.

11:35.481 --> 11:36.641
Can we even do that?

11:36.661 --> 11:37.582
I don't know.

11:37.602 --> 11:41.323
We could try.

11:41.423 --> 11:42.804
Committed to it!

11:42.824 --> 11:45.144
1 million BAUs too!

11:50.424 --> 11:53.165
Gotta celebrate big things with a big BAU, right?

11:53.966 --> 11:54.546
Maybe.

11:54.566 --> 11:58.168
BAU BAU!

11:59.469 --> 12:00.969
That would be so stupid.

12:01.089 --> 12:01.690
Right!

12:01.710 --> 12:03.030
Right.

12:03.271 --> 12:05.192
Yeah, we better get BAU BAUing.

12:06.552 --> 12:07.593
How are you gonna count them?

12:07.853 --> 12:09.454
That's the funny part, Ruffians.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.575
You're gonna count them!

12:13.796 --> 12:14.416
Quiet it!

12:15.017 --> 12:15.257
Right.

12:19.290 --> 12:19.911
Oh no!

12:20.151 --> 12:20.951
Oh no!

12:21.192 --> 12:22.252
BAU BAU!

12:22.993 --> 12:24.134
It's a group effort, okay?

12:24.254 --> 12:24.834
Right!

12:25.335 --> 12:33.041
You know, just like this journey's been, it's a group effort, so... Thank you Ruffians for making it such a special journey!

12:33.602 --> 12:35.063
BAU BAU!

12:38.165 --> 12:38.866
Fuwamoco!

12:39.686 --> 12:42.308
Well, you know, as a part of our last

12:50.219 --> 12:51.680
Our last Valentine's Day!

12:52.800 --> 12:56.722
As a part of our Valentine's Day, our last present to you!

12:56.802 --> 12:59.803
Our last Valentine's Day!

12:59.823 --> 13:03.825
Our last present to you on Valentine's Day.

13:04.185 --> 13:13.969
We released a brand new song cover of Let Me Be With You from the anime show, BAU BAU!

13:15.990 --> 13:21.433
We're so so happy to share this one with you because it's a really precious song to us.

13:21.653 --> 13:26.056
We really had such a fun time recording it, you know, with all the harmonies.

13:26.336 --> 13:33.280
I'm so happy to be able to share it with so many Ruffians who might be discovering it for the first time too.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.983
It's so cute!

13:37.063 --> 13:38.444
Thank you!

13:38.464 --> 13:39.204
Nostalgia!

13:39.224 --> 13:42.946
So, if you haven't had a listen to it yet, please go check it out, okay?

13:44.247 --> 13:44.627
I don't know.

13:44.887 --> 13:48.909
I think it's the perfect song for the upcoming spring season!

13:49.069 --> 13:50.929
It's a bit of an earworm too, okay?

13:52.150 --> 13:58.112
You might find yourself going... Throughout your day, okay?

13:59.534 --> 14:00.315
Be warned!

14:00.875 --> 14:13.148
I know that when I was brushing my teeth, I was like... I'm glad you like it so much, Ruffians!

14:13.629 --> 14:14.890
Please listen to it more!

14:15.110 --> 14:17.273
Maybe it can be your soundtrack for spring.

14:18.414 --> 14:19.515
We'll be happy.

14:20.316 --> 14:21.898
BAU BAU!

14:24.642 --> 14:40.551
Also, FUWAMOCO, we received a very special Valentine's gift from none other than our beloved mama, Icomochi-mama!

14:41.751 --> 14:42.552
Look!

14:43.052 --> 14:46.074
We're so cute!

14:46.114 --> 14:50.796
Thank you, Icomochi-mama, for always being so warm and loving and doting on us too!

14:52.837 --> 14:54.959
It actually makes us really happy!

14:55.379 --> 14:59.801
You know, to see Icomochi-mama's tweets of her thoughts while watching our streams too!

14:59.841 --> 15:00.321
You know?

15:00.481 --> 15:05.344
And like, often we'll go to the toilet and say, you know, BAU BAU now, right before our stream.

15:05.724 --> 15:11.647
And we'll see, you know, that Icomochi-mama just woke up because of the ohayou tweet, you know?

15:12.547 --> 15:15.228
So, I always kind of think, ah, baby!

15:15.248 --> 15:16.449
You know?

15:16.469 --> 15:17.750
Did she?

15:17.950 --> 15:18.110
Did she?

15:18.470 --> 15:20.551
Wake up just to watch us stream!

15:22.272 --> 15:25.013
I can't help but kind of think that, you know?

15:25.033 --> 15:32.396
And Icomochi-mama was really excited about our Valentine's Day stream and the cover of Let Me Be With You too.

15:33.237 --> 15:35.378
So we're always so thankful!

15:36.644 --> 15:43.868
No, I. Actually, Icomochi-mama said that we don't need to tweet back and say thank you to her so much.

15:44.488 --> 15:45.148
But we want to!

15:45.208 --> 15:46.529
We want to!

15:46.749 --> 15:48.770
Because she's our dear mama, okay?

15:49.211 --> 15:50.971
And she means so much to us.

15:51.011 --> 15:52.252
So, so much.

15:52.392 --> 15:54.313
So, we'll continue!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.955
Watch and learn!

15:57.435 --> 15:59.096
We love you Icomochi-mama!

15:59.156 --> 16:00.276
BAU BAU!

16:00.316 --> 16:01.097
BAU BAU!

16:03.958 --> 16:05.959
We're so lucky Ruffians.

16:06.580 --> 16:07.981
Such lucky puppies.

16:08.141 --> 16:08.441
BAU BAU!

16:08.461 --> 16:13.444
Thank you Icomochi-mama.

16:13.484 --> 16:14.045
Thank you.

16:14.065 --> 16:15.185
Ruffians.

16:24.033 --> 16:31.478
I had a very strange and in-depth dream last night.

16:32.639 --> 16:34.260
It felt very immersive.

16:36.522 --> 16:39.844
I don't really know what went on, but do you want to hear?

16:46.823 --> 16:48.805
Well, here I go!

16:49.925 --> 16:53.548
You need to pay attention because it's strange, okay?

16:53.628 --> 16:57.832
I'm going to do my best to explain it.

16:58.612 --> 17:04.697
So, to begin, we're at some kind of party-like event with all the Ruffians.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.940
And there's a big sprint line that we had to run.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.081
Like a marathon?

17:09.101 --> 17:09.661
Like a race?

17:09.681 --> 17:11.122
Yeah, but a sprint.

17:11.182 --> 17:12.403
A long but small one.

17:13.124 --> 17:13.864
So I ran it.

17:14.865 --> 17:17.647
And I don't know if I had a good time score or not.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.670
It doesn't really seem like it was that important.

17:21.450 --> 17:23.091
I don't even know, I just ran it.

17:23.672 --> 17:25.493
But I finished it.

17:26.014 --> 17:31.558
And then, all the Ruffians, they took that, what was the sprint line?

17:32.198 --> 17:36.201
And they rolled it up into a big crepe.

17:36.502 --> 17:38.883
Like the size of a yoga mat-sized crepe.

17:39.123 --> 17:40.985
A very, very big crepe, okay.

17:42.986 --> 17:44.368
It was a surprise, okay?

17:44.648 --> 17:57.418
So both of us walked into another room and all the Ruffians had the crepe all decorated on a huge plate with some strawberries and cheesecake slices and, you know, other berries for decoration.

17:57.438 --> 17:59.420
And it looked really, really nice.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.040
Beautiful.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.301
Good job, Ruffians.

18:02.242 --> 18:05.023
So I was happy because obviously- A creep, Ruffians!

18:05.063 --> 18:05.844
Not grapes!

18:06.044 --> 18:06.724
A creep!

18:06.984 --> 18:09.085
A creep, okay?

18:09.505 --> 18:14.628
But you know, I was happy because it was obvious that you all did your best together to make it look nice.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.108
But...

18:18.991 --> 18:28.486
Truth be told, as soon as I looked at it, I turned to Fuwawa and said, Fuwawa, if we try to eat this, we're gonna get sick.

18:30.429 --> 18:31.551
Why should we do it?

18:32.947 --> 18:35.769
You can't eat a crepe as big as a yoga mat, Ruffians.

18:38.591 --> 18:46.116
And then, there was one Ruffian who tried to show me some sort of parody comic that had a bunch of different characters in it.

18:46.176 --> 18:49.138
It was very thick, like, and there's characters- Like how many pages?

18:49.218 --> 18:50.359
Like, a lot.

18:50.519 --> 18:52.440
A couple, like, hundred or so.

18:52.941 --> 18:53.581
That's a lot!

18:53.721 --> 18:54.662
It was big, it was thick.

18:54.682 --> 18:55.562
I think you had 20 pages.

18:55.622 --> 18:56.343
No, no, no.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.284
It was thick.

18:57.944 --> 19:05.169
But there's a bunch of different characters like there's Batman and Hello Kitty and FUWAMOCO in it!

19:05.609 --> 19:08.211
We're up there with Batman and Hello Kitty though!

19:08.331 --> 19:08.571
Yeah!

19:08.731 --> 19:09.551
Oh my gosh.

19:09.571 --> 19:22.379
So I looked at it thinking that it was just something they wanted to show me but I was disappointed because FUWAMOCO in it didn't really seem like FUWAMOCO's personality was.

19:23.320 --> 19:28.707
We were saying things that we wouldn't usually say, and you know, it just wasn't our personalities.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.172
It just seemed like a drawing of some character!

19:32.792 --> 19:34.154
Very derivative, yeah.

19:34.555 --> 19:37.298
So, maybe I was a bit harsh!

19:39.280 --> 19:44.322
I said that, that part of the comic was a bit of a shame and it took me out of the world.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.982
And I sort of went on a little tangent.

19:49.303 --> 19:53.104
And then, I noticed that they looked really disappointed.

19:54.864 --> 19:58.966
And then I realized, maybe they had made this comic...

20:00.950 --> 20:02.411
So, I was really worried!

20:02.831 --> 20:04.931
And trying to find him to apologize!

20:05.552 --> 20:09.073
And then I woke up!

20:10.393 --> 20:11.514
I thought it wasn't theirs.

20:11.614 --> 20:15.195
I thought it was, like, you know, maybe a company have released it.

20:15.235 --> 20:16.516
Because it was really big!

20:16.776 --> 20:18.436
It was all just a misunderstanding.

20:18.536 --> 20:21.077
It was a misunderstanding!

20:22.338 --> 20:22.498
What?

20:23.672 --> 20:25.195
It was a strange but happy dream.

20:25.435 --> 20:27.960
You never did find the Ruffian though.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.083
So Ruffians, that was you!

20:30.404 --> 20:32.287
Moco-chan, sorry!

20:33.029 --> 20:35.333
But I was happy because the Ruffian went.

20:39.099 --> 20:40.860
That comic was terrible.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.321
It wasn't terrible!

20:42.361 --> 20:47.444
It was well done, it's just, you know, sometimes things are like that.

20:47.764 --> 20:50.866
FUWAMOCO doesn't say BAU BAU, it says FUWAMOCO.

20:51.406 --> 20:51.727
Right?

20:52.547 --> 20:58.591
You know, if you get a doujinshi and then it's like, it's cute, but the personality isn't there.

20:59.851 --> 21:00.532
Is it really?

21:00.552 --> 21:03.393
You know... Right?

21:08.446 --> 21:09.607
That's to think about!

21:09.707 --> 21:12.869
BAU BAU!

21:13.070 --> 21:15.391
HSDJMoco-chan.

21:15.411 --> 21:16.212
Thank you.

21:17.293 --> 21:19.354
BAU BAU!

21:20.335 --> 21:24.017
Ruffians.

21:24.678 --> 21:30.482
We talked about it a little bit yesterday, but we have a confession to make.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.757
FUWAMOCO, you know we're very fluffy and fuzzy.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.078
We don't get that grumpy.

21:41.118 --> 21:41.458
No!

21:42.319 --> 21:43.920
That's not a part of FUWAMOCO.

21:44.480 --> 21:57.587
But, well, we talked about it, but sometimes we have a tendency to watch videos of fancy cafes and, you know, food places on YouTube!

21:57.827 --> 22:01.028
You know the little videos with the song... Or the...

22:04.150 --> 22:06.871
Actually, I can get pretty heated while watching them.

22:06.891 --> 22:07.251
I think this...

22:20.290 --> 22:23.933
Without a doubt, it's the most toxic thing about us.

22:24.293 --> 22:33.361
Because you know, Ruffians will be like lots of restaurants that try to make cute and fancy items for people to take photos of, right?

22:33.421 --> 22:36.903
You know, for the grounds and everything, that sort of thing.

22:37.444 --> 22:38.785
Yeah, but, well...

22:42.426 --> 22:53.548
You know, like, they'll have, like, a sad crepe and they'll feel it overflowing with this oily whipped cream and the whole way up and then, oh, I'll just kind of brulee it so it'll make you nice.

22:53.608 --> 22:56.189
It looks visually pleasing and then I'll just be selling it for $20!

22:56.229 --> 22:57.389
Yeah, yeah!

22:57.429 --> 23:00.730
How are you gonna eat that without being sick?

23:00.810 --> 23:04.450
It's just, it's just a ton of cheap oily whipped cream.

23:04.530 --> 23:07.271
How are, why do you want to just eat whipped cream?

23:07.371 --> 23:07.851
Yeah.

23:08.331 --> 23:10.592
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

23:32.302 --> 23:34.382
Of course, it makes us so happy!

23:34.763 --> 23:36.983
And they say it's a sandwich, but they give you a spoon?

23:37.083 --> 23:37.723
I'm sorry!

23:37.843 --> 23:40.844
When was the last time you ate a sandwich with a spoon?

23:41.184 --> 23:42.404
We get a bit toxic.

23:42.784 --> 23:53.066
You know, Ruffians will even see our videos and bring it to each other and be like, How dare they!

23:53.106 --> 23:56.667
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

23:56.687 --> 24:01.268
So, Ruffians, you know when ordering fancy foods and going around to cute cafes,

24:02.248 --> 24:05.729
Probably best to avoid those silly items, you know, like that.

24:06.169 --> 24:08.610
Otherwise, you might get a bit grumpy.

24:08.630 --> 24:15.351
Don't be like fancy cafes, but it's important to go to the nice ones, and not the silly ones.

24:15.711 --> 24:17.632
Pick the nice things, you know.

24:18.052 --> 24:20.572
Treat yourself to something worth it, okay?

24:20.612 --> 24:23.693
Not just a crate filled with whipping cream.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.514
It's just whipping cream!

24:25.574 --> 24:26.814
Yeah, or they'll put like the...

24:27.194 --> 24:28.815
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

24:44.444 --> 24:46.046
That's all.

24:47.046 --> 24:50.950
That's FUWAMOCO's toxic tweet.

24:51.770 --> 24:53.312
I like the nice ones.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.833
Not the not good ones.

24:55.173 --> 24:57.695
BAU BAU!

24:58.516 --> 24:59.937
Are you hungry for sweets?

25:00.538 --> 25:04.661
You have the whole rest of your day to find a good sweet to treat yourself with.

25:04.681 --> 25:06.403
Well, maybe this next part is not gonna help, huh?

25:10.316 --> 25:21.504
We've been hearing some big reports about this new mysterious and viral trend.

25:22.425 --> 25:25.827
It goes by the name of Marshmallow Mania.

25:26.684 --> 25:27.925
Yeah.

25:27.985 --> 25:39.610
Yeah, it's hard to tell what exactly it is, but it seems like a lot of the talk generated around it is actually, uh, the less-than-stellar reviews.

25:40.350 --> 25:40.650
Yeah.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.652
No, it seems like the reviews about it are sort of mixed.

25:44.332 --> 25:48.494
You know, half of them being fluffy and the other half being fuzzy.

25:48.514 --> 25:48.614
Oh no.

25:51.335 --> 25:53.957
Fluffy and fuzzy marshmallows.

25:55.659 --> 25:59.222
The other big question surrounding it is what is it?

26:00.103 --> 26:01.704
Is it a popular drink?

26:02.945 --> 26:03.386
I knew it.

26:06.013 --> 26:18.064
Well, you know, it could be like a milk latte with marshmallow fuzz and even more marshmallow sprinkled on top.

26:18.464 --> 26:20.205
Maybe it's a special dessert.

26:21.026 --> 26:25.310
Marshmallows covered in melted marshmallow topped with koi sugar and then bruleed.

26:27.705 --> 26:32.946
It definitely sounds like, you know, something you need to take photos of.

26:32.986 --> 26:35.487
Then upload to social media.

26:35.547 --> 26:37.947
Marshmallow mania for the ground.

26:38.168 --> 26:44.269
Just watch out though, cause you know, FUWAMOCO might find your video and then decide to hate on it.

26:44.889 --> 26:51.311
Ruffians, maybe let us know if you find out more about marshmallow mania.

26:52.831 --> 26:55.473
The Doggy Pack has heard more about it.

26:56.013 --> 26:58.854
So if you're curious, try asking them.

26:59.355 --> 26:59.715
Maybe?

26:59.975 --> 27:01.456
BAU BAU!

27:01.496 --> 27:03.237
BAU BAU!

27:03.457 --> 27:03.977
No FUWAMOCO!

27:04.017 --> 27:05.078
Weird trends high.

27:06.119 --> 27:07.279
Trends are weird high.

27:07.299 --> 27:08.340
Trends are weird.

27:09.096 --> 27:09.556
Yeah.

27:10.076 --> 27:14.437
Although I heard that probably don't ask Biboo what Marshmallow Mania is about.

27:14.517 --> 27:17.157
I don't think that's her area of trending.

27:17.538 --> 27:19.498
No, she's more on the other trends.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.358
The other trends.

27:20.518 --> 27:21.038
Yeah.

27:21.278 --> 27:22.158
BAU BAU!

27:22.178 --> 27:26.299
Ruffians!

27:26.679 --> 27:28.039
Let's take out- take out?

27:28.119 --> 27:30.260
Take out?

27:30.320 --> 27:33.740
Are we gonna bodyslam it?

27:34.161 --> 27:36.221
Let's take out the Doggie of the Day!

27:38.828 --> 27:46.916
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

27:48.078 --> 27:51.861
It's Daisy!

27:51.902 --> 27:53.984
Look at those beautiful chompers!

27:56.326 --> 27:57.968
I just love you!

27:58.268 --> 28:00.730
Doggy Dentist!

28:00.890 --> 28:07.156
You know, she's apparently gotten a bit older now and finally just realized how fun toys are.

28:07.656 --> 28:09.898
And that tug of war, it rocks!

28:10.398 --> 28:13.481
It really actually does, I agree with Daisy.

28:13.501 --> 28:14.142
Tug of war.

28:16.142 --> 28:21.724
After playing a bunch of pantlings, she also turns into a cuddle bug.

28:22.264 --> 28:23.425
Cute.

28:24.005 --> 28:28.126
Well, how does Daisy BAU BAU go?

28:32.418 --> 28:34.259
I like that!

28:35.079 --> 28:45.462
I think it's beautiful jumpers.

28:45.862 --> 28:50.024
Daisy is a sweetheart who loves life together with you!

28:50.444 --> 28:53.705
You know, she just figured out how fun it is to play together.

28:53.725 --> 28:59.627
So I think she'd really like to be able to catch up on all those tug-of-war matches when she missed them all.

29:00.727 --> 29:02.829
Now is the time!

29:02.949 --> 29:08.735
Please let her cuddle with you and give her lots of head pats afterwards too, okay?

29:09.415 --> 29:11.457
BAU BAU!

29:13.219 --> 29:17.202
And next, we have our Today I Went on a Walk.

29:17.402 --> 29:18.624
We have De-den!

29:23.327 --> 29:26.409
That looks like it was a chilly walk.

29:26.530 --> 29:27.710
A bit cold, huh?

29:28.611 --> 29:31.233
Hopefully the snow has all melted now.

29:31.653 --> 29:33.094
Goodbye snow.

29:33.755 --> 29:37.818
Yeah, well, we're glad that you're getting out and about between our streams.

29:37.858 --> 29:38.398
Yeah!

29:38.558 --> 29:41.420
We'll do our best to do the same too, huh?

29:41.620 --> 29:42.021
Right.

29:42.441 --> 29:45.823
It always feels so good to stretch the paws and get moving.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.906
Yeah, it's really important to do so, Ruffians.

29:49.466 --> 29:51.508
So, you know what that sounds like?

29:52.309 --> 29:55.772
It might be perfect to go on a walk after FUWAMOCO Morning!

29:58.034 --> 29:59.015
Give it a shot, okay?

29:59.956 --> 30:01.377
BAU BAU!

30:01.437 --> 30:06.842
Don't forget to use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING when you do, okay?

30:06.862 --> 30:08.704
BAU BAU!

30:09.224 --> 30:12.908
And next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

30:14.909 --> 30:16.791
FUWAMOCO!

30:16.811 --> 30:21.755
I love your Let Me Be With You cover so much!

30:21.775 --> 30:29.941
I was just wondering, if you're thinking of putting English lyric captions on the song covers, I think it would enhance the listening experience for the Ruffians.

30:30.222 --> 30:32.583
Thank you!

30:32.603 --> 30:33.784
Thank you for the question!

30:33.864 --> 30:36.106
We really love you!

30:36.166 --> 30:37.948
We love you so so much!

30:38.368 --> 30:40.590
But you know, well...

30:41.605 --> 30:43.046
It's a little tricky.

30:43.066 --> 30:45.709
We really, really, you know, lyrics are important to us.

30:45.769 --> 30:46.890
They're very important.

30:47.150 --> 30:51.995
It's not that easy because, you know, we need to ask the creators if it's okay.

30:52.015 --> 30:54.337
Because, you know, it's their baby, too.

30:54.797 --> 30:58.300
And then, you know, we need to get them to check the translation of the lyrics.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.102
They agree if it's accurate.

31:00.562 --> 31:01.443
And then, you know,

31:02.344 --> 31:04.685
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

31:26.241 --> 31:31.062
Many Ruffians from all over the world can understand, too.

31:31.162 --> 31:33.923
It's too bad about covers, huh?

31:34.163 --> 31:36.203
You'll just have to look up a translation yourself.

31:36.543 --> 31:37.643
If that's okay to ask.

31:37.963 --> 31:38.324
BAU BAU!

31:38.544 --> 31:43.845
It would be nice, huh?

31:44.045 --> 31:46.045
It can't be, huh?

31:46.085 --> 31:48.045
With originals it's different, you know?

31:48.066 --> 31:50.326
But covers, it's a little tricky.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.919
BAU BAU!

31:52.939 --> 31:56.760
Thank you so much for all your submissions.

31:57.140 --> 32:04.362
You're a very, very important part of FUWAMOCO Morning, so we hope you'll continue to send us little parts of your world.

32:04.682 --> 32:09.163
Your doggies, your walks, your questions, your Pero Sightings.

32:09.763 --> 32:10.764
All of them, okay?

32:10.784 --> 32:12.244
We're always waiting!

32:12.284 --> 32:13.184
We're waiting!

32:13.304 --> 32:14.024
Thank you!

32:14.145 --> 32:15.765
BAU BAU!

32:16.445 --> 32:20.166
And for our next team coming up today, we have

32:21.135 --> 32:23.516
Lethal Company!

32:23.596 --> 32:25.737
Together with all of Advent.

32:26.238 --> 32:29.439
Yeah, Moco-chan, you've been really itching to play.

32:29.459 --> 32:32.481
So, we're looking forward to it.

32:32.601 --> 32:36.903
Actually, I'm not playing.

32:39.471 --> 32:41.432
Fuwawa wanted to play recently.

32:41.452 --> 32:43.313
She thought she would be good.

32:44.394 --> 32:45.755
So she played on her own.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.016
Solo little company.

32:48.056 --> 32:49.517
She couldn't find the entrance.

32:49.917 --> 32:51.658
No!

32:51.718 --> 32:53.039
And then I got found.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.920
Before I found the entrance!

32:55.845 --> 33:03.588
So, well, I'm not the greatest asset to the company, but maybe Moco-chan, maybe you can be the greatest asset to the company.

33:04.329 --> 33:06.710
I wanna be good.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.010
Let's give up on me.

33:09.671 --> 33:12.752
BAU BAU!

33:13.672 --> 33:17.514
And for our schedule, well, this weekend,

33:17.774 --> 33:25.257
We have a bit of a homework day on Sunday, but that's okay because on Saturday, we're gonna be- Metal Gear Solid 2!

33:25.437 --> 33:29.038
We're finishing off Metal Gear Solid 2.

33:29.998 --> 33:32.019
Can we stop Solidus in the end?

33:32.439 --> 33:34.320
I really don't know at this point.
