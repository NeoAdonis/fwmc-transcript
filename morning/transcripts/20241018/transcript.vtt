05:03.123 --> 05:05.846
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:05.906 --> 05:08.188
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:14.855 --> 05:18.797
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:19.318 --> 05:21.979
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:22.079 --> 05:23.880
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:23.940 --> 05:26.782
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:27.502 --> 05:31.805
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:31.865 --> 05:34.566
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:34.646 --> 05:35.367
Ruffians!

05:35.447 --> 05:37.968
Thank you for joining us for our 134th episode today!

05:41.430 --> 05:43.933
BAU BAU!

05:44.433 --> 05:45.654
It's been a while!

05:45.854 --> 05:46.715
BAU BAU!

05:46.775 --> 05:47.656
Thank you Ruffians!

05:47.756 --> 05:49.197
BAU BAU!

05:49.217 --> 05:52.921
And I see so many new Ruffians recently too!

05:53.101 --> 05:54.903
BAU BAU!

05:57.445 --> 06:00.008
Thank you for joining us for the first time today!

06:00.148 --> 06:06.355
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:06.615 --> 06:07.736
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:08.237 --> 06:11.521
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:11.561 --> 06:13.122
BAU BAU!

06:13.943 --> 06:19.705
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:20.285 --> 06:21.765
Please tweet your thoughts.

06:21.805 --> 06:22.565
This is important.

06:22.725 --> 06:27.667
With the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:27.907 --> 06:31.488
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:31.508 --> 06:32.228
BAU BAU!

06:33.828 --> 06:36.230
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:36.250 --> 06:41.813
I'm happy that we're able to spend today this morning together with you.

06:42.393 --> 06:47.636
Especially after the past few mornings being a little rough for FUWAMOCO.

06:47.656 --> 06:49.237
Thank you!

06:49.357 --> 06:51.458
BAU BAU!

06:51.958 --> 06:56.601
We have lots of things to talk about, Ruffians!

06:57.201 --> 06:58.162
Are you ready?

06:58.182 --> 06:59.762
Do you have your breakfast ready?

07:00.163 --> 07:00.723
Coffee?

07:00.843 --> 07:01.523
Tea ready?

07:02.724 --> 07:05.548
Are you ready for disappointment?

07:06.589 --> 07:08.391
Why disappointment, Moco-chan?

07:10.534 --> 07:13.758
FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:14.619 --> 07:17.483
We're live right now, what's disappointing, huh?

07:17.503 --> 07:20.467
There's been another Pero Sighting.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.235
What are we gonna do about that, huh?

07:28.515 --> 07:31.077
Where was he seen this time, Moco-chan?

07:31.577 --> 07:34.779
Let's take a look!

07:34.959 --> 07:39.822
De-den!

07:41.323 --> 07:43.084
Your fridge is empty now.

07:45.346 --> 07:50.369
The only thing left inside, Ruffians, is no Pero.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.611
It's disappointment.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.652
That's basically Pero, huh?

07:55.692 --> 07:56.473
Yeah, basically.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.775
Basically, pao pao.

08:00.255 --> 08:02.055
It even makes you feel any better!

08:03.215 --> 08:05.016
The fridge kinda looks like ours now.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.356
Yeah.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.357
Yeah, matching fridges.

08:08.377 --> 08:09.097
Yeah!

08:09.917 --> 08:15.698
The only difference though is that our fridge has lots of tea and chikuwa in it and fish cakes.

08:15.738 --> 08:15.838
Yeah!

08:16.058 --> 08:18.239
My other one is sorta identical.

08:18.459 --> 08:20.359
Identical fridges.

08:20.379 --> 08:20.459
Yeah!

08:20.799 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, but you know, that means Ruffians!

08:24.238 --> 08:25.940
Grocery shopping!

08:25.980 --> 08:26.780
Yeah!

08:27.101 --> 08:29.823
And you know, we could just go together, right?

08:30.083 --> 08:30.884
Yeah!

08:31.064 --> 08:32.885
Grocery shopping with FUWAMOCO!

08:32.966 --> 08:33.966
Yeah!

08:34.327 --> 08:37.710
Lots of fun to experience!

08:37.790 --> 08:38.250
Wow!

08:38.270 --> 08:38.690
Yeah.

08:39.071 --> 08:41.373
But make sure you know before you put the groceries in.

08:41.573 --> 08:46.157
It's probably best that you clean Pero right out of there.

08:46.277 --> 08:46.777
Yeah.

08:47.198 --> 08:47.338
Yeah.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.460
Otherwise you'll have to go grocery shopping again.

08:53.888 --> 08:58.590
BAU BAU!

09:00.370 --> 09:03.731
It's good to know it seems like Pero hasn't seen that much this week.

09:04.031 --> 09:06.992
If you close the door then you don't see him again!

09:07.672 --> 09:09.153
Lights out for you, Pero.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.354
Because the lights go off when you close the fridge.

09:11.474 --> 09:14.595
BAU BAU!

09:14.615 --> 09:17.195
Wow, how weird!

09:17.555 --> 09:19.716
There's been a little bit of an update, huh?

09:19.816 --> 09:20.816
Update?

09:20.896 --> 09:21.737
A little update?

09:24.290 --> 09:25.091
Ruffians!

09:25.532 --> 09:27.194
We did it!

09:27.414 --> 09:28.215
FUWAMOCO!

09:28.456 --> 09:31.500
Our big dream came true!

09:31.680 --> 09:37.027
We reached 1 million!

09:37.047 --> 09:40.272
1 million subscribers on YouTube!

09:40.972 --> 09:44.693
Thank you so much for supporting us, Ruffians!

09:44.713 --> 09:47.454
Thank you so much!

09:47.714 --> 10:02.477
You know, whether you've been here from the very moment that we debuted, or maybe found us rather recently, or maybe even today, we're so happy to have you here by our sides and be able to protect your smile too!

10:02.617 --> 10:04.598
It really means the world to us.

10:04.618 --> 10:05.238
Everything.

10:06.298 --> 10:11.459
And you know, we'll continue working like demon dogs here to make even more dreams come true!

10:11.499 --> 10:13.860
To do even more cool and silly things!

10:14.240 --> 10:19.281
And try things that we never thought we'd do!

10:19.581 --> 10:20.901
And Ruffians!

10:21.022 --> 10:25.422
We spent the moment that our dreams came true together with you!

10:25.803 --> 10:27.403
Doing what we love most!

10:29.781 --> 10:31.964
I'm protecting your smile!

10:31.984 --> 10:33.506
That goes without saying.

10:33.907 --> 10:42.098
But the very moment that we crossed into one million, FUWAMOCO we were singing our original song, Born to be BAU!

10:44.502 --> 10:45.663
Oh, it was a miracle!

10:45.683 --> 10:47.905
You just happened to wake up like that, huh?

10:47.925 --> 10:49.266
Just right at the quiz!

10:49.747 --> 10:50.327
Right!

10:50.347 --> 10:51.008
BAU BAU!

10:51.128 --> 10:53.410
BAU BAU!

10:53.470 --> 10:55.432
Yo, thank you so much, Ruffians!

10:55.452 --> 10:56.853
It was perfect, yeah!

10:56.913 --> 10:57.573
Right!

10:59.615 --> 11:08.962
You know, we know we have lots of goals and dreams, and hitting one million, that was a big one that we've always aimed towards since debut.

11:09.323 --> 11:19.630
And you know, now that we've achieved this goal, our next big goal that we're aiming towards is to one day have our own FUWAMOCO solo live!

11:19.751 --> 11:22.593
FUWAMOCO solo live!

11:23.213 --> 11:31.755
Yeah, you know, but that kind of dream, having a solo live, it's something that almost every member of hololive dreams of.

11:32.255 --> 11:45.818
So, FUWAMOCO, we're going to be very stubborn and work hard towards it so that maybe, one day, if it happens, that we can perform a bunch of our original songs!

11:45.898 --> 11:46.198
Yeah!

11:46.758 --> 11:51.199
Only to get better at singing, get better at dancing, and also get

11:51.819 --> 11:53.661
More original songs, right?

11:53.941 --> 11:54.282
Thank you.

11:54.322 --> 11:58.966
So we're gonna work really hard, FUWAMOCO!

11:59.567 --> 12:03.210
Please continue to cheer for FUWAMOCO!

12:03.731 --> 12:04.251
Got it!

12:04.592 --> 12:07.815
It's not gonna be an easy path, but let's do this!

12:08.315 --> 12:10.558
Let's make this dream come true!

12:10.658 --> 12:11.479
BAU BAU!

12:13.040 --> 12:15.521
Have a day, you Ruffians!

12:16.062 --> 12:20.484
I think there's some Ruffians that are still at 1 million celebration rates.

12:22.805 --> 12:24.246
Soon.

12:24.466 --> 12:25.026
Ish.

12:25.086 --> 12:27.187
You surprised us Ruffians!

12:27.407 --> 12:27.687
Ish.

12:27.867 --> 12:28.988
So you're gonna have to wait.

12:30.429 --> 12:30.989
Soon.

12:31.569 --> 12:31.769
Ish.

12:31.909 --> 12:32.210
BAU BAU!

12:41.029 --> 12:42.669
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:43.430 --> 12:45.890
BAU BAU!

12:46.290 --> 12:47.551
I wouldn't worry for now.

12:48.191 --> 12:49.311
I wouldn't worry for now.

12:49.871 --> 12:50.271
Yeah.

12:50.852 --> 12:51.332
Okay.

12:51.452 --> 12:51.852
Yeah.

12:52.512 --> 12:54.012
It's on.

12:54.453 --> 12:56.553
BAU BAU!

12:57.433 --> 12:58.994
Ruffians, I'm sure you can...

13:00.287 --> 13:01.128
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:01.169 --> 13:01.890
FUWAMOCO Morning!

13:12.632 --> 13:17.034
And now we've both been all kinds of under the weather!

13:17.734 --> 13:21.556
But we've been doing our best!

13:21.896 --> 13:27.118
It seems like it's likely the same cold that is generally going around right now.

13:27.138 --> 13:32.540
I think there's a lot of senpai that are feeling a little bit the same as us.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.962
But you know, we saw Moco-chan.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.142
Moco-chan, you first lost your voice, right?

13:39.763 --> 13:49.668
And I think there's a lot of Ruffians wondering, you know, while Moco-chan doesn't have her voice right now, what is it Fuwawa just stream on her own?

13:50.048 --> 13:51.209
And that's a good question.

13:51.309 --> 13:52.329
It's a good question!

13:52.809 --> 13:59.573
But, well, if one of us gets sick, usually the other is not very far behind.

14:01.099 --> 14:02.501
You know, we can tell.

14:03.362 --> 14:06.666
And you know when Fuwawa did Fuwawa Week earlier in the year?

14:06.766 --> 14:09.149
She could tell then, that she was okay.

14:09.169 --> 14:10.011
I was okay.

14:10.071 --> 14:12.214
But this time, it's not the same.

14:12.374 --> 14:14.196
Not the same.

14:14.236 --> 14:14.597
Yeah.

14:16.798 --> 14:17.739
Sickness.

14:18.439 --> 14:21.580
Is this how it is, you know?

14:21.820 --> 14:22.440
But anyway!

14:22.460 --> 14:24.540
I went to the doctor!

14:24.780 --> 14:26.961
And I got an all okay!

14:27.361 --> 14:28.301
As in, you know.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.782
My barker is barking.

14:31.902 --> 14:34.663
And my vocal chords are totally normal.

14:35.003 --> 14:37.264
Weren't damaged, injured or anything.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.964
No surgery needed, you know.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.625
But it doesn't mean that

14:44.538 --> 14:51.900
So I'll take the medicine I got, and I'll do my best to get better through the game!

14:52.180 --> 14:56.341
FUWAMOCO, you know we'll do our best to take it as easy as possible.

14:56.401 --> 15:08.104
We'll heal up, but please understand, you know, if we sound a little bit scratchy, or if maybe the schedule, our stream schedule has to be adjusted a little bit because of things.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.041
Thank you for understanding.

15:11.061 --> 15:14.002
We're doing our best!

15:14.122 --> 15:17.543
But, you know, I think we're getting better slowly but surely here.

15:17.623 --> 15:18.643
Slowly but surely.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.144
BAU BAU!

15:20.704 --> 15:26.726
We're hanging out with friends.

15:26.866 --> 15:28.126
We're doing good.

15:28.207 --> 15:30.147
Every night.

15:30.267 --> 15:32.768
Fuwawa, we feel well today.

15:32.828 --> 15:34.009
Don't we work hard?

15:35.928 --> 15:38.209
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

16:06.776 --> 16:08.917
Moco-chan no onaka!

16:28.656 --> 16:29.336
Hi!

16:29.796 --> 16:31.677
Moco-chan's tummy!

16:31.697 --> 16:34.718
It's a little prominent, right?

16:34.758 --> 16:38.419
Like, prominent as in... I'm gonna poke it.

16:38.919 --> 16:41.280
Why won't it poke it?

16:41.400 --> 16:41.640
No.

16:43.340 --> 16:43.780
No.

16:44.601 --> 16:47.001
You... You wouldn't do such a thing.

16:47.541 --> 16:47.761
Bye.

16:50.773 --> 16:55.036
I think Icomochi-mama was even suggesting something like that.

17:07.105 --> 17:07.625
You win.

17:08.365 --> 17:09.927
Just remember, Ruffians.

17:10.747 --> 17:12.008
Don't touch the gas.

17:12.809 --> 17:14.009
Don't touch the tail.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.051
And don't touch the tongue.

17:17.288 --> 17:18.831
BAU BAU!

17:19.492 --> 17:23.999
But we really really can't wait until we meet you all as Ruffians!

17:24.580 --> 17:29.467
In our FUWAMOCO we even ordered our full set too!

17:29.648 --> 17:30.449
BAU BAU!

17:36.449 --> 17:41.230
Now we can have all of us and everyone watching over us this year.

17:41.910 --> 17:48.072
But it seems like there's been a lot of excitement at Shiori and Nerissa.

17:48.832 --> 17:51.773
They've kind of even sold out currently on Geek Check.

17:52.093 --> 17:53.714
You know, maybe for Ruffians.

17:55.054 --> 17:57.955
Over in Europe and Australia.

17:58.375 --> 18:03.137
So if you're planning to get an order of two Ruffians, please do so!

18:03.197 --> 18:06.998
Check them out on the hololive official shop too, okay?

18:07.379 --> 18:09.159
We will sell them too!

18:10.340 --> 18:13.040
BAU BAU!

18:13.121 --> 18:15.161
Please check them out, okay Ruffians?

18:15.241 --> 18:19.143
And if you're interested, maybe... Yeah, they're still the official shop, okay?

18:19.163 --> 18:20.543
They're still the official shop!

18:20.803 --> 18:21.564
Today we stock...

18:26.092 --> 18:27.873
Let's look forward to the announcement, okay?

18:28.465 --> 18:44.994
We know that there is some talk about this extra silly, extra chaotic stream.

18:45.094 --> 18:46.917
A very weird experience.

18:47.057 --> 18:49.321
Yeah, we had a bit of a weird experience.

18:49.626 --> 18:49.886
BAU BAU

18:51.523 --> 18:56.167
Wow, FUWAMOCO, we participated in Mio-senpai's stream!

18:56.407 --> 18:59.829
The Hoshou Marin's Brain Battle!

19:00.990 --> 19:02.391
It was a weird experience.

19:02.491 --> 19:02.832
But!

19:03.172 --> 19:09.297
We are the loveliest, and fluffiest, and fuzziest version of Marin-senpai!

19:09.617 --> 19:19.345
But you know, Ruffians, if you check it out, you can see just how chaotic and cursed the stream was.

19:20.585 --> 19:23.306
Yeah, it was even close before it even started.

19:25.307 --> 19:25.907
It was.

19:25.987 --> 19:30.309
But you had, you know, FUWAMOCO we had the lovely Marin.

19:30.389 --> 19:31.750
Yeah!

19:31.890 --> 19:35.671
And then we had also Mio-senpai's gyaru Marin.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.372
Subaru-senpai's passion Marin.

19:38.832 --> 19:41.233
Okayu-senpai's sensitive Marin.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.354
Fubuki-senpai's otaku Marin.

19:43.514 --> 19:46.175
And Raiden as intelligent Marin.

19:46.655 --> 19:47.976
Yeah, BAU BAU!

19:59.614 --> 20:10.417
We did our best to solve Marine-senpai's biggest concerns, you know, like what she should stream or other concerns related to dating.

20:12.157 --> 20:12.678
Love!

20:14.778 --> 20:18.179
We did our best, you know, suggesting very lovely things.

20:18.946 --> 20:24.635
But we got voted out right away by the Real Mighty.

20:24.836 --> 20:25.577
Why?

20:25.777 --> 20:28.001
BAU BAU!

20:28.041 --> 20:30.144
Just cause you said Hunter Hunter isn't lovely.

20:33.254 --> 20:33.774
Hi.

20:33.954 --> 20:35.675
I think it's lovely okay.

20:36.115 --> 20:38.235
I just thought that it wasn't lovely enough for you.

20:38.856 --> 20:39.676
Only Marnie.

20:42.176 --> 20:43.657
Bye bye.

20:43.777 --> 20:52.379
But you know maybe that was the best because well things started to get very wild when the breaks you know FUWAMOCO.

20:52.399 --> 20:53.259
Ra-den.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.920
When they're taken away and then everybody

20:57.397 --> 20:57.937
I lost it.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.978
It went so really high.

21:01.118 --> 21:04.039
You know, there's a mention of a mighty mist.

21:04.099 --> 21:06.780
We skipped the dangerous smell and went right to the mist.

21:07.260 --> 21:10.521
Yeah, it was a bit different.

21:10.681 --> 21:11.221
Yeah.

21:11.501 --> 21:13.502
It was a weird experience.

21:13.762 --> 21:15.162
A little bit scary.

21:15.182 --> 21:16.903
A bit like a Japanese battle.

21:18.384 --> 21:22.827
But you know, it seems like we blew away everyone with our impersonations.

21:23.688 --> 21:24.909
It's so fun!

21:25.329 --> 21:27.551
Especially in English, you know?

21:28.472 --> 21:31.494
I did my best to become English, Marnie.

21:32.055 --> 21:35.217
You know, hololive English is 3rd generation.

21:35.437 --> 21:36.158
What does that mean?

21:36.864 --> 21:37.905
Morning senpai.

21:38.265 --> 21:38.605
Advent.

21:39.526 --> 21:39.706
Oh.

21:40.346 --> 21:40.586
Advent.

21:40.606 --> 21:48.431
So if you didn't check it out, please go check out the stream over on Mio-senpai's channel!

21:48.451 --> 21:51.612
Yeah, English writing was so good!

21:51.632 --> 21:54.374
BAU BAU!

21:54.394 --> 21:55.074
I'm glad!

21:55.094 --> 21:56.215
You do the voice now!

21:56.235 --> 21:59.417
It's gonna sound really funny, Ruffians, so no.

21:59.497 --> 22:00.998
It sounds very nasally, huh?

22:01.038 --> 22:06.201
Yeah, I think that was so Ruffian saying that I was pinching my nose, but no.

22:13.101 --> 22:14.182
BAU BAU!

23:14.661 --> 23:16.162
BAU BAU!

23:16.222 --> 23:20.023
Thank you for meeting Ruffians!

23:20.043 --> 23:23.005
We're FUWAMOCO-chan!

23:23.505 --> 23:26.366
BAU BAU!

23:26.426 --> 23:30.068
Ruffians go check out Mari's Brain Battle on Mio-senpai's channel!

23:34.536 --> 23:35.558
Ruffians!

23:35.638 --> 23:38.901
Did you see our big announcement in the middle of the night?

23:38.961 --> 23:39.662
It's a big one!

23:54.946 --> 23:55.867
Wow.

23:55.987 --> 24:06.535
The other day, you know, we did an off co-op for the first time with the ASMR Goddess and also created our original introduction song, Lifetime Showtime style.

24:06.675 --> 24:09.377
The very one and only SUPATORA!

24:09.457 --> 24:10.838
Yeah, right!

24:10.858 --> 24:23.507
Yeah, but last night, it was announced that FUWAMOCO will be releasing an ASMR voice pack directed, produced by SUPATORA!

24:24.528 --> 24:26.469
BAU BAU!

24:26.529 --> 24:28.890
Completely overseen all by her!

24:29.351 --> 24:33.873
And recorded at her very own Patola Studio!

24:33.913 --> 24:35.834
BAU BAU!

24:36.335 --> 24:38.976
Patola Studio was amazing!

24:39.076 --> 24:40.277
BAU BAU!

24:45.520 --> 24:46.300
BAU BAU!

24:46.360 --> 24:48.742
Ruffians, you made it!

24:48.782 --> 24:49.122
Right!

24:49.682 --> 24:49.983
Right!

24:55.997 --> 24:56.678
I'm excited!

24:56.738 --> 24:57.578
Looking forward to it!

24:58.038 --> 25:00.479
Thank you for waiting!

25:01.360 --> 25:14.925
As you know, it gets better because the voice pack will be on sale in only a few hours from now at 8pm PT or 12 noon GST.

25:15.665 --> 25:18.747
You can find it on the official hololive shop for $4!

25:19.567 --> 25:21.668
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:21.708 --> 25:22.708
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:22.788 --> 25:23.448
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:23.468 --> 25:25.269
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

25:45.218 --> 25:52.826
So you can experience both FUWAMOCO in Oni and in English and Japanese too!

25:53.366 --> 25:59.092
Look at the illustrations here all for you!

26:01.843 --> 26:12.152
That means you'll have to look forward to what Moco-chan's way may be!

26:12.552 --> 26:15.035
But it's super cute, right?

26:15.115 --> 26:16.576
You might even want it as a

26:17.372 --> 26:18.252
BAU BAU!

26:48.775 --> 26:50.575
Thank you for waiting, Ruffians.

26:50.655 --> 26:54.376
I think Moco-chan's corker is hurting a little bit.

26:54.396 --> 26:55.837
BAU BAU.

26:56.317 --> 27:03.098
But at the studio, we'll be doing a bunch of fun things together with Patra and Neza.

27:03.118 --> 27:06.979
So if you're not able to watch live, please don't worry.

27:07.019 --> 27:10.520
You'll be able to catch it all in the archive later.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.461
But we're going to do our best to help you relax.

27:15.081 --> 27:20.264
Ruffians, please let us know when the voice pack of our first ASMR goes on sale.

27:20.585 --> 27:23.967
Please let us know what you think on Twitter.

27:24.407 --> 27:26.489
And also the collab stream as well.

27:26.509 --> 27:30.331
We're not gonna give you any hints.

27:30.971 --> 27:34.073
We're recording it right now.

27:34.093 --> 27:37.175
It has to be a mystery, okay?

27:37.636 --> 27:40.838
But Ruffians, you can probably guess

27:42.703 --> 27:48.887
Our hearts were beating really fast and it was really embarrassing.

27:48.907 --> 27:49.128
BAU BAU!

27:49.148 --> 27:50.929
Please take a little kiss!

27:50.949 --> 27:51.909
BAU BAU!

27:54.286 --> 27:55.947
I'm so excited!

27:56.267 --> 28:00.648
We've been working really hard on FUWAMOCO and PANDORA-ONEESAN too!

28:01.049 --> 28:03.570
BAU BAU!

28:04.210 --> 28:07.511
Moco-chan, it's been a little while.

28:07.531 --> 28:10.972
Can we take a look at our Doggie of the Day today?

28:11.232 --> 28:13.713
Our Doggie of the Day is... Mochi!

28:13.853 --> 28:15.394
BAU BAU!

28:20.357 --> 28:21.538
Look at that!

28:21.998 --> 28:23.039
Oh my gosh!

28:23.940 --> 28:25.161
A big yawn?

28:26.121 --> 28:26.502
What?

28:27.603 --> 28:32.546
BAU BAU, she's just too cute!

28:32.767 --> 28:38.671
That tummy, I just wanna stick my face in it.

28:38.791 --> 28:40.052
BAU BAU!

28:46.761 --> 28:48.063
BAU BAU!

28:48.183 --> 28:49.424
Morning!

28:49.444 --> 28:50.846
A very cute Doggie of the Day.

28:50.906 --> 28:51.847
A doggy of the week?

28:52.027 --> 28:52.868
Morning!

28:53.429 --> 28:56.993
So cute, you can kinda see something on the tummy there.

28:57.013 --> 28:57.473
Very cute.

28:57.513 --> 28:58.795
Someone's homework.

28:58.815 --> 29:00.277
I love how there's mochi.

29:00.297 --> 29:00.917
BAU BAU, Moco-chan.

29:00.957 --> 29:01.178
BAU BAU!

29:08.973 --> 29:09.934
BAU BAU!

29:22.453 --> 29:24.434
She's just too cute!

29:52.741 --> 29:53.542
Mochi is mochi.

29:53.562 --> 29:53.942
Mochi is a food.

29:53.962 --> 29:54.683
I will eat mochi.

30:15.602 --> 30:17.903
BAU BAU!

30:18.264 --> 30:21.365
Let's take a look at what you've been going around on today!

30:21.385 --> 30:25.488
And right on our mark, we have... De-den!

30:25.508 --> 30:31.751
Did you get to see Haachama-senpai and Shiori at Anime Emporium?

30:31.771 --> 30:31.831
Yes!

30:32.512 --> 30:35.393
We're so happy!

30:35.794 --> 30:40.937
Yeah, it sounds like... Well, if it's Shiori and Haachama-senpai together then...

30:42.020 --> 30:44.903
I'm sure there was a lot of trouble that went on, huh?

30:44.923 --> 30:46.624
A lot of chaos?

30:48.306 --> 30:50.328
Things that can't be spoken of, maybe?

30:50.348 --> 30:51.749
Maybe!

30:53.551 --> 31:03.080
But we're so happy that you've been able to get out and have lots of fun at different conventions and hopefully also meet lots of different people!

31:03.120 --> 31:04.461
And meet new friends too!

31:06.403 --> 31:08.704
BAU BAU!

31:08.784 --> 31:13.947
But Iron Impulse was so much fun when we went so we hope that we can be back again soon.

31:14.527 --> 31:17.208
BAU BAU!

31:17.949 --> 31:21.170
And next we have our Question of the Day!

31:21.310 --> 31:24.152
We have De-den!

31:24.612 --> 31:26.113
Hi FUWAMOCO!

31:26.453 --> 31:29.515
Have you ever thought about getting bunk beds again in the future?

31:29.535 --> 31:33.977
Or do you feel content and comfy with just sleeping on your own beds distance from each other?

31:40.433 --> 31:42.714
What do you think it is, Ruffians?

31:44.195 --> 31:45.635
Well, I see.

31:45.655 --> 31:48.276
It's definitely not a no.

31:48.436 --> 31:49.396
Not a no.

31:50.016 --> 31:58.399
You know, actually, well, recently especially we've been feeling like our beds, they're rather stiff.

31:58.839 --> 31:59.999
They're pretty hard to lie.

32:00.319 --> 32:05.381
We're both really surprised that the ground feels a lot more soft than our beds do.

32:06.572 --> 32:08.092
We notice that when we go up there.

32:08.332 --> 32:09.573
Why is that, huh?

32:09.953 --> 32:10.393
Right.

32:10.733 --> 32:15.274
But you know, it's okay because by the end of the day, we're so tired.

32:15.994 --> 32:18.414
That's... That is amazing.

32:18.994 --> 32:19.335
It's good!

32:19.395 --> 32:23.095
Yeah, a good bed, so... You know, getting a new bed.

32:23.155 --> 32:24.416
Maybe a bunk bed.

32:25.036 --> 32:27.376
It's not a complete... No.

32:27.416 --> 32:28.396
Not completely.

32:28.576 --> 32:28.876
Yeah.

32:29.317 --> 32:29.897
Not complete.

32:29.957 --> 32:30.597
That's for sure.

32:30.897 --> 32:35.358
But... Getting a new bed might be nice in the future but...

32:36.858 --> 32:38.419
You thought we had a bunk bed still?

32:39.260 --> 32:40.380
Sorry to break your jaws.

32:40.881 --> 32:42.522
BAU BAU BAU!

32:42.582 --> 32:46.564
We needed a bed for the doghouse and the bunk bed, but we'll get here very soon.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.265
BAU BAU!

32:48.686 --> 32:52.188
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

32:52.228 --> 32:55.090
Your Pero Sighting Doggy of a Day!

32:55.490 --> 32:59.052
Sharing your walks with us and also sending us your questions!

32:59.413 --> 33:05.917
We got so many great questions recently during our Marshmallow streams, so please send us more questions, Ruffians!

33:12.724 --> 33:16.547
Please, when you send us a submission, don't forget to use the hashtag!

33:17.067 --> 33:19.109
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

33:19.169 --> 33:19.829
BAU BAU!

33:19.869 --> 33:24.413
Thank you, Ruffians!

33:24.993 --> 33:27.115
And we have our next stream coming up!

33:27.335 --> 33:28.576
Very exciting one!

33:28.916 --> 33:33.820
We have our 3D collab with Patra!

33:33.960 --> 33:36.562
It's gonna be again at 3AM PT or 6AM ET.

33:38.643 --> 33:39.805
Very nervous.

33:39.905 --> 33:41.286
Very nervous.

33:41.326 --> 33:42.268
We're gonna do our best.

33:54.663 --> 33:57.584
But it'll be a lot of fun with Patra Onee-san there.

33:57.604 --> 34:05.287
She's gonna teach us a bunch of different things too, I'm sure, so... BAU BAU!

34:05.307 --> 34:09.048
3D FUWAMOCO again, too!

34:09.108 --> 34:10.648
BAU BAU!

34:11.308 --> 34:13.589
And let's take a look at our schedule for this week!

34:14.069 --> 34:14.729
BAU BAU!

34:14.770 --> 34:18.871
Thank you, Ruffians, for understanding all the changes that have happened since we got sick.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.993
Continue a little bit of the changes.

34:22.514 --> 34:31.882
Well, this Sunday, instead of our Super Chat Reading at 6pm, we'll now be doing full lives together with the Doggy Pack then!

34:31.902 --> 34:33.464
Thank you for waiting.

34:33.524 --> 34:43.233
Doggy Pack I know has kind of changed a little bit there, but we will be doing a Super Chat Reading again in the future, so for Ruffians who are looking forward to that,

34:43.693 --> 34:44.874
Don't worry, okay?

34:44.894 --> 34:44.954
And!

34:45.294 --> 34:46.835
Doggy Pack!

34:47.255 --> 34:49.217
Mitsuhi got your four guys all ready.

34:49.237 --> 34:50.878
Then you're ready to play!

34:50.898 --> 34:53.660
And... Hopefully let us beat you.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.922
BAU BAU!

35:01.665 --> 35:02.226
Wow!

35:02.546 --> 35:05.868
FUWAMOFUJUTSU are joining us to the archive today!

35:05.888 --> 35:07.749
Here's your FUWAMOCO word!

35:08.009 --> 35:11.252
It's BAU BAU ASMR!

35:11.392 --> 35:12.092
BAU BAU!

35:15.781 --> 35:18.884
Thank you so much Ruffians for joining us today!

35:19.204 --> 35:23.168
Not for understanding that FUWAMOCO is still a little bit under the weather.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.009
We'll get through it really soon!

35:25.049 --> 35:28.552
We're gonna have a bunch of fun tomorrow!

35:28.572 --> 35:34.677
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

35:35.845 --> 35:37.206
Yuukikaze anime!

35:37.366 --> 35:38.847

35:39.147 --> 35:39.867

35:43.089 --> 35:44.390
