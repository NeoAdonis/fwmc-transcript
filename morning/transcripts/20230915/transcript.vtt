05:06.665 --> 05:09.560
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:09.884 --> 05:14.308
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:14.469 --> 05:21.776
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:22.276 --> 05:24.558
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:24.618 --> 05:27.021
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:27.081 --> 05:27.441
BAU BAU!

05:29.603 --> 05:33.246
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:33.466 --> 05:37.650
Thank you for joining us for our 20th episode today!

05:37.670 --> 05:37.710
20th!

05:37.830 --> 05:41.713
Can you believe it already?

05:41.733 --> 05:45.397
I can't, but you know what's even better than 20 episodes?

05:45.497 --> 05:45.637
What?

05:45.657 --> 05:46.197
22 episodes.

05:49.285 --> 05:51.967
BAU BAU!

05:55.369 --> 05:58.732
Well, Ruffians, maybe today's your first time joining us.

05:59.312 --> 06:05.657
Well, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:05.677 --> 06:05.737
A.K.A.

06:06.277 --> 06:07.398
FUWAMOCO.

06:07.978 --> 06:10.720
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:10.880 --> 06:11.401
Always us.

06:13.612 --> 06:14.112
Pronounced.

06:14.652 --> 06:16.613
Pronounced, you have plans.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.733
But please, Fuwawa.

06:18.273 --> 06:18.973
Please don't.

06:19.253 --> 06:25.454
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:25.634 --> 06:35.176
Ruffians, if you could please tweet any thoughts, you know, thoughts, feelings, with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.736
We'd be really happy.

06:37.996 --> 06:41.777
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:42.017 --> 06:42.657
BAU BAU!

06:43.738 --> 06:47.185
Well, Ruffians, a new day.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.087
A new day.

06:48.528 --> 06:52.436
And it seems like there's been another Ruffian that spotted Pero.

06:52.456 --> 06:52.737
Ueshi deshita.

06:58.726 --> 07:06.588
I guess, you know, while this ruffian was on a nice daily walk, they spotted Pero, or... Maybe!

07:06.628 --> 07:07.708
Maybe that's what they think!

07:08.308 --> 07:11.189
He was there and then he just disappeared.

07:11.209 --> 07:12.730
Yeah, that's what they said, you know.

07:12.850 --> 07:20.212
Disappeared as soon as they turned around, but... Are you sure that he was really there in the first place, though?

07:20.512 --> 07:21.412
He's not a ghost.

07:23.075 --> 07:31.066
Well, you know, if you look at all the autumn leaves on the ground already by that bench, it's kind of getting to that time of year, right?

07:31.166 --> 07:31.787
Right!

07:32.388 --> 07:35.071
How though?

07:35.111 --> 07:37.214
It's gone really fast, hasn't it, Moco-chan?

07:37.254 --> 07:38.796
Well, like, summer just ended, so...

07:39.864 --> 07:42.025
And now it's hololive autumn.

07:43.065 --> 07:45.346
I like that too!

07:45.726 --> 07:53.368
Lots of sweaters, warm drinks, sweet potatoes.

07:53.468 --> 07:59.430
Ruffians, if you see Pero, maybe first you should give your eyes a bit of a rub.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.571
Just make sure that it's okay that you're actually seeing him.

08:04.204 --> 08:11.869
Well, at the very least, I think these ruffians, they're able to have a really nice walk filled with crisp air.

08:11.969 --> 08:15.752
It's nice to go from summer to fall.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.573
So I'm really glad.

08:17.793 --> 08:24.878
You know, this time of year, it might be sort of nice to stop at FUWAMOCO Cafe and get maybe a yummy drink from us.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.599
Like Chilipachino.

08:27.019 --> 08:28.020
I recommend it.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.041
BAU BAU!

08:31.603 --> 08:34.905
Ruffians, please let us know if you see Pero around again.

08:35.185 --> 08:37.307
Maybe give your eyes a bit of a rub first.

08:38.287 --> 08:43.291
And don't forget to use the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

08:44.192 --> 08:45.573
I don't doubt this Ruffian though.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.534
You don't?

08:46.594 --> 08:46.994
You don't?

08:47.094 --> 08:47.454
Maybe.

08:47.534 --> 08:48.075
I don't know.

08:48.115 --> 08:50.837
I don't really... Thank you!

08:51.017 --> 08:51.277
BAU BAU!

08:57.321 --> 09:01.324
Ruffians, I think it's been pretty good recently.

09:01.364 --> 09:03.225
A lot of celebratory times.

09:03.705 --> 09:06.047
Big celebrations, things to be happy about.

09:06.267 --> 09:08.648
But it still continues!

09:09.029 --> 09:12.091
Because... Kyaotsu!

09:12.111 --> 09:19.776
Ai-senpai, Fauna-senpai, Kronii-senpai, they're having their 3D showcase this weekend!

09:20.937 --> 09:22.598
Are you as excited as we are?

09:22.998 --> 09:23.718
Ruffians!

09:25.498 --> 09:26.641
BAU BAU!

09:26.661 --> 09:27.282
You excited?

09:27.322 --> 09:28.464
You excited?

09:29.406 --> 09:33.535
I'm looking forward to seeing them move their 3D bodies, you know, doing

09:33.871 --> 09:35.772
Whatever they want, you know.

09:36.272 --> 09:39.092
All the things that they've been dreaming of.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.493
It's exciting, you know.

09:42.553 --> 09:50.676
I think, personally, we always really like it when there's a lot of singing and dancing, so... That's kind of a selfish wish.

09:51.176 --> 09:54.137
We want to see them both sing and dance their original songs.

09:54.197 --> 09:57.057
Especially Fauna-senpai's Let Me Stay Here.

10:00.054 --> 10:01.996
It was really nice at 4th Fest, right?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.498
We wanna see it again.

10:04.658 --> 10:07.101
Original songs are always good, you know?

10:08.242 --> 10:12.366
But we're wishing our senpai an amazing 3D showcase!

10:12.386 --> 10:13.226
We'll be watching!

10:13.266 --> 10:14.007
We'll be there!

10:14.888 --> 10:16.950
So make sure, Ruffians, that you're there too, okay?

10:17.130 --> 10:20.433
You know, 3D showcase only happens once, you know?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.514
So... BAU BAU!

10:24.522 --> 10:28.703
Wow, yesterday we had our first Twitter speech, right Moco-chan?

10:28.943 --> 10:34.165
And doing it, you know, we did a lot of tidying here and there, getting rid of the fluff and the fuzz.

10:34.445 --> 10:37.926
And we also used the vacuum a little bit, right?

10:38.086 --> 10:39.766
But there's also another vacuum.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.448
And for some reason, the ruffians are really interested in it!

10:46.795 --> 10:47.215
Instead!

10:47.936 --> 10:48.596
Cuz I said I would.

11:03.605 --> 11:04.807
I drew a picture of him.

11:04.827 --> 11:08.252
There he is!

11:08.312 --> 11:13.038
Wait, Moco-chan, you usually only draw pictures of like, other members or senpai.

11:13.058 --> 11:16.043
This kind of makes it feel like the vacuums are senpai, no?

11:16.183 --> 11:17.505
No, it's just a coincidence.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.187
Oh, it's a coincidence.

11:20.227 --> 11:21.548
Yeah, it's a coincidence.

11:21.588 --> 11:22.448
He's not our senpai.

11:22.488 --> 11:38.755
I mean, he has been around for a while, but... I think he was a gift maybe from Mama Puppy or Papa Puppy when they didn't need him anymore, but... I don't think he was too happy with us, because he sort of gave up before we were able to use him too much.

11:38.975 --> 11:42.156
Just kind of came here and then... Didn't really do anything.

11:42.176 --> 11:43.897
He looks like he has energy, but...

11:45.017 --> 11:45.638
He doesn't work.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.499
No, not anymore.

11:47.519 --> 11:51.603
So for now, he'll just keep in his spot.

11:52.343 --> 11:55.105
Until he needs to go away, right?

11:56.326 --> 11:57.567
Is that okay though?

11:57.708 --> 12:00.190
It's kind of nice to have an empty spot.

12:00.410 --> 12:01.331
He'll just hang around.

12:01.351 --> 12:02.011
Just for now.

12:04.717 --> 12:05.577
He has a spirit.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.158
Yeah, yeah.

12:06.238 --> 12:06.798
Exactly.

12:07.459 --> 12:08.560
Rest well, Vacuum.

12:09.020 --> 12:09.501
Rest well.

12:09.541 --> 12:11.722
Yeah, it might be his retirement home.

12:11.822 --> 12:13.844
Maybe his retirement spot.

12:13.964 --> 12:15.045
Should we have a party?

12:15.065 --> 12:17.707
This is good enough.

12:17.727 --> 12:18.608
This is good enough.

12:18.628 --> 12:20.770
We made an appearance on FUWAMOCO Morning.

12:20.950 --> 12:21.750
Okay.

12:21.830 --> 12:23.392
So any more and we'll go to...

12:23.892 --> 12:25.473
It's...it's...vacuum head.

12:25.493 --> 12:29.574
You're good now, you're not curious anymore.

12:29.594 --> 12:30.054
Right?

12:30.314 --> 12:30.914
Right!

12:31.374 --> 12:33.475
Don't want to bit on him.

12:33.995 --> 12:38.376
And what's important is that we have another light vacuum that's easy to use.

12:38.616 --> 12:39.917
And here's the one that you heard.

12:41.817 --> 12:45.358
Just sometimes it's not the strongest against the fluff and the fuzz.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.419
We need heavy duty.

12:47.459 --> 12:48.199
BAU BAU!

12:52.273 --> 12:53.654
Wow, ruffians.

12:54.934 --> 13:05.260
There's been a bit of another misunderstanding, but this time, you know, it's not my fault.

13:06.849 --> 13:08.751
It's not though.

13:09.272 --> 13:10.073
It's Ruffians.

13:10.253 --> 13:11.715
It's not!

13:13.337 --> 13:17.521
But, you know, I had nothing to do with it this time.

13:19.424 --> 13:23.068
But actually, I didn't really understand this too much at first.

13:23.688 --> 13:25.010
So, I don't know.

13:25.290 --> 13:25.751
Somehow...

13:27.113 --> 13:31.594
Ruffians, you know, last FUWAMOCO Morning was Miss Bird Anniversary, right?

13:31.654 --> 13:35.435
And Moco-chan drew a picture of all our senpais.

13:35.595 --> 13:36.436
I did my best!

13:36.476 --> 13:44.258
Yeah, and somehow, I think there were a lot of ruffians that thought that Ina-senpai looks a little bit strange.

13:46.999 --> 13:47.439
Right!

13:48.259 --> 13:48.679
Right!

13:49.920 --> 13:50.780
I did my best.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.102
Don't laugh!

13:56.663 --> 13:57.624
What?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.485
She doesn't look weird.

14:02.488 --> 14:03.129
No.

14:03.149 --> 14:04.450
This is how she looks all the time.

14:04.850 --> 14:05.151
Right.

14:05.371 --> 14:07.112
Are you using your brain?

14:07.893 --> 14:09.334
How does it look strange?

14:10.235 --> 14:13.819
It looks exactly the same as the other Missing Council members that I drew.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.400
Right, right.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.861
You know you have her eyes.

14:16.881 --> 14:17.442
Her eyes?

14:17.522 --> 14:18.563
And then her mouth.

14:18.663 --> 14:19.043
Yeah.

14:20.563 --> 14:29.092
Yeah, I think Moco-chan, I think maybe some ruffians are getting confused because the collar kind of looks like the mouth, you know?

14:29.112 --> 14:33.897
Maybe, you know, like, and then there's like a mustache?

14:34.137 --> 14:34.458
No.

14:34.978 --> 14:37.661
And maybe the mouth is now a nose?

14:37.921 --> 14:38.062
No.

14:39.315 --> 14:42.197
You have to use your brain, okay?

14:42.397 --> 14:43.278
A smile would've helped.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.019
See, that Ruffian's a bit confused.

14:46.039 --> 14:46.099
Why?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.701
Dina-senpai is smiling.

14:48.761 --> 14:49.822
It's a big smile, right?

14:49.862 --> 14:50.062
Yeah!

14:50.102 --> 14:51.403
It's a big smile!

14:52.185 --> 14:53.045
Not a no.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.166
It's an upturned smile.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.307
Why would I ever draw Ina-senpai weird?

14:56.327 --> 15:00.869
You know, I want to draw her peaceful and resting eyes, you know, just like her.

15:00.889 --> 15:01.269
Yeah.

15:01.329 --> 15:02.689
And a big smile.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.490
Big smile.

15:03.530 --> 15:04.810
Make it very cute.

15:05.190 --> 15:06.811
She doesn't look sad!

15:07.991 --> 15:09.272
She looks happy!

15:09.292 --> 15:10.833
Peaceful!

15:11.813 --> 15:12.433
You know it!

15:13.454 --> 15:14.374
Ruffians, you too.

15:14.434 --> 15:17.115
You need to use your eyes and your brain, okay?

15:18.035 --> 15:21.417
Wait, that's the most... Yeah, the... The nice... The nice...

15:22.236 --> 15:24.937
The nose that all the Ruffians are seeing, that's the mouth!

15:25.857 --> 15:31.360
And the eyes are like... And then the collar!

15:31.660 --> 15:32.860
The collar is on the neck!

15:32.960 --> 15:34.341
It's not a moustache!

15:35.081 --> 15:40.283
Not a moustache... Do you see it?

15:40.303 --> 15:41.524
Go and see it like that!

15:41.564 --> 15:42.604
See it directly!

15:42.624 --> 15:44.245
Do you get it now, Ruffians?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.321
There is no nose!

15:48.361 --> 15:49.762
There is no nose!

15:49.862 --> 15:51.103
Forget about the nose!

15:51.223 --> 15:53.305
Forget about the nose!

15:55.506 --> 15:58.268
Look at the proper Ina-senpai now.

15:58.488 --> 15:59.629
Use your brain and look at it.

15:59.649 --> 16:05.833
If you're still a bit confused, look at Ina-senpai, and then look at Moco-chan's drawing, and then it should be all good, right?

16:07.635 --> 16:09.036
BAU BAU.

16:13.622 --> 16:14.242
You don't see it?

16:14.262 --> 16:16.383
You just see a cute Ina-senpai?

16:17.024 --> 16:17.544
Happy!

16:18.004 --> 16:19.265
Happy, right, Moco-chan?

16:19.285 --> 16:21.686
Do you see a cute Moco-chan?

16:22.266 --> 16:22.546
Why?

16:22.586 --> 16:26.208
Do you see a cute Moco-chan?

16:26.268 --> 16:29.209
Not anymore because it's not there, but... Why?

16:29.549 --> 16:29.669
Oh!

16:30.830 --> 16:32.150
I heard Ina-senpai.

16:32.230 --> 16:36.192
Is there a cute Moco-chan here?

16:38.073 --> 16:39.194
Is that what you're asking?

16:41.475 --> 16:42.055
I'm hard.

16:47.122 --> 16:47.562
Yes.

16:47.982 --> 16:48.642
Moco-chan.

16:49.783 --> 16:50.643
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

16:50.663 --> 16:56.684
I don't think I can continue FUWAMOCO Morning if it's like this.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.165
Maybe we should just go to it.

17:00.205 --> 17:00.825
No, no, no.

17:01.305 --> 17:03.266
It's not that time yet, Moco-chan.

17:03.346 --> 17:04.666
It's not that time yet.

17:09.447 --> 17:10.107
It's your fault.

17:10.367 --> 17:11.448
My fault?

17:11.488 --> 17:12.328
No, ruffians.

17:13.348 --> 17:14.408
But you're at fault.

17:14.428 --> 17:15.269
Why am I at fault?

17:21.787 --> 17:22.368
Cute!

17:23.388 --> 17:24.069
Cute!

17:26.090 --> 17:26.431
Okay.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.553
I guess we can continue then.

17:29.593 --> 17:31.635
Moco-chan, you're so childish sometimes.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.395
I'm not!

17:32.496 --> 17:33.676
It's very important.

17:34.117 --> 17:35.938
It's my feelings, okay?

17:35.998 --> 17:39.521
That's true, feelings are very important.

17:39.861 --> 17:41.323
Wow, ruffians!

17:42.388 --> 17:50.574
We keep on hearing more and more Ruffians mentioning that you're kind of surprised at how FUWAMOCO operates.

17:50.934 --> 17:55.837
You know, how surprisingly we're on time, we're very consistent with our schedule.

17:55.877 --> 17:58.419
Yeah, you should know that by now.

17:58.439 --> 17:58.739
Right!

17:58.799 --> 17:59.160
Right!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.222
You know, we have a certain way that we like to do things.

18:02.722 --> 18:07.543
Yeah, you know we always make sure to start our stream like 5 minutes before the hour.

18:07.563 --> 18:10.444
To start on exactly the right time.

18:10.904 --> 18:12.425
Release our schedule in advance.

18:12.445 --> 18:14.686
That way you can make plans too.

18:14.806 --> 18:16.546
It's just how we do things, you know?

18:16.566 --> 18:21.068
You know, this is how we feel we can best protect your smile.

18:21.148 --> 18:25.049
You know, this also kind of shows how much you mean to us too, right?

18:26.414 --> 18:37.379
You know, we know life isn't easy, so we thought, at the very least, that this might make it a bit easier for you to play with us and to fit us into your everyday, you know?

18:37.879 --> 18:42.341
But you know, it's also something that we felt, too, before.

18:42.361 --> 18:46.302
So I wanted to explain to you a bit.

18:46.482 --> 18:47.663
So, I guess...

18:49.056 --> 18:59.200
For us, I guess particularly me, I was a big fan of a tiny, small idol theater that would stream live stream performances.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.141
So they would do the performance, but they would stream it as well.

19:02.641 --> 19:08.243
And when they did live stream it, it would be around 3 or 4 AM in the Northwest Passage.

19:09.785 --> 19:11.666
So, it was very, very early.

19:11.926 --> 19:13.087
Very early.

19:13.508 --> 19:15.189
But I really wanted to watch it!

19:15.489 --> 19:17.251
And be a part of it no matter what!

19:17.731 --> 19:21.614
So, even though less than 10 people were watching the stream, I would be there.

19:22.395 --> 19:30.021
And... Even though it... It was a live stream, but you know, the stream quality... It was really, really low.

19:30.441 --> 19:33.023
So often, you couldn't make out the idols' faces.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.445
But you know, the audio was good.

19:35.685 --> 19:36.586
So, it was worth it.

19:37.407 --> 19:37.507
And...

19:38.988 --> 19:42.331
The worst part was there was no archive.

19:42.691 --> 19:43.832
Never ever ever.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.435
So you know, I would have to wake up in order to watch.

19:46.475 --> 19:47.636
There was no other option.

19:47.856 --> 19:48.356
No option.

19:48.556 --> 19:50.838
And they streamed around 5 days a week.

19:51.459 --> 19:53.981
And I watched it like that for around 2 to 3 years.

19:54.001 --> 19:55.723
2 to 3 years.

19:56.283 --> 19:56.964
But you know what?

19:59.918 --> 20:01.859
It ended up being really frustrating.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.681
Moco-chan, you've been pretty grumpy some days.

20:04.902 --> 20:08.444
Yeah, because a lot of times they would start late.

20:08.764 --> 20:12.887
Like maybe halfway through the set or even not at all for almost weeks on end.

20:13.508 --> 20:15.469
And there would never be an explanation.

20:17.571 --> 20:19.652
So, it would make me really upset.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.874
But if it did go live, it was really really good and it was really awesome.

20:24.434 --> 20:29.677
And sometimes if there's a special event, it would usually mean that there is no stream.

20:30.158 --> 20:36.081
But sometimes, just sometimes, they would stream the special event.

20:36.101 --> 20:40.123
And it was amazing, so I would never know if they were going live or not.

20:40.483 --> 20:41.104
Right.

20:41.704 --> 20:43.945
But you want to make sure that you're this way.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.546
Don't miss it if you do.

20:45.626 --> 20:48.048
And you know sometimes they would forget to turn off the stream.

20:49.289 --> 20:54.612
But all I knew that even if they weren't streaming, it was going on.

20:54.932 --> 20:56.833
That's the most frustrating part, right?

20:56.873 --> 20:57.713
It's going on!

20:57.733 --> 20:59.915
They could turn on the camera, but they aren't!

21:00.635 --> 21:06.321
So, and then if I watched, then I could start my day with a big burst of energy, you know?

21:07.062 --> 21:08.904
So, it was really nice.

21:09.064 --> 21:11.127
I enjoyed the two to three years.

21:11.707 --> 21:14.510
Even though it was kind of ups and downs, right?

21:15.011 --> 21:21.518
But you know, sadly, they started to turn on the stream less and less.

21:22.865 --> 21:28.772
And eventually I just gave up after hoping for a stream for months and months and months.

21:32.469 --> 21:36.651
But you know, because of that, we're like we are now!

21:36.771 --> 21:39.792
You know, we learned how important it is to be on time!

21:39.812 --> 21:42.293
You're trusting us.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.534
You want to be here to support us.

21:45.074 --> 21:48.736
And if we aren't here as we promised, then you'll be sad.

21:49.796 --> 21:58.760
And we definitely don't want to disappoint you, so if we can do this to show to you how we feel through our actions and not just words, we're gonna do it!

21:58.960 --> 21:59.881
It means a lot to us.

22:00.601 --> 22:01.302
You being here.

22:01.322 --> 22:14.495
And that's why, you know, we said that if we were to oversleep or we made a mistake with our schedule, that it would devastate us because it really, really would.

22:14.515 --> 22:15.916
We know the feelings really well.

22:16.256 --> 22:16.737
Yeah.

22:17.097 --> 22:18.839
But we're doing our best!

22:19.339 --> 22:20.580
We might make mistakes.

22:21.642 --> 22:29.049
If that ever does happen, please be really, really gentle with us, okay?

22:29.149 --> 22:33.313
Because FUWAMOCO, we won't be good.

22:34.374 --> 22:35.595
We won't be good.

22:35.916 --> 22:38.939
But we know the feelings, so... We'll do our best.

22:39.019 --> 22:40.380
Thank you, Ruffians!

22:44.404 --> 22:46.005
FUWAMOCO-chan!

22:46.445 --> 22:50.627
I think it's time to find out who is the Doggie of the Day today.

22:50.647 --> 22:52.168
Let's see.

22:52.588 --> 22:56.330
It's Aspen!

22:56.751 --> 22:57.511
Aspen!

22:57.731 --> 23:03.274
I've been having the most comfy, most cozy nap in the summer.

23:03.434 --> 23:04.755
I'm not jealous at all.

23:04.795 --> 23:05.055
Right?

23:05.375 --> 23:07.116
It'd be nice to switch places with Aspen.

23:09.335 --> 23:12.816
Ruffians, wouldn't it just be nice to be Aspen for a day?

23:12.836 --> 23:14.657
I'm so sleepy now.

23:14.677 --> 23:15.937
See ya.

23:16.117 --> 23:18.578
See ya.

23:19.118 --> 23:20.038
Alright.

23:20.198 --> 23:21.398
Let me switch places.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.160
Such a cute and...

23:26.940 --> 23:29.622
Cozy and strong Doggie of the Day.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.043
I mean Aspen is a strong name after all.

23:32.143 --> 23:32.363
Right?

23:32.644 --> 23:33.484
Like the tree.

23:33.504 --> 23:34.124
Right.

23:34.585 --> 23:35.966
Strong tree.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.847
And also a very strong dog.

23:39.688 --> 23:40.728
A very good doggy.

23:40.768 --> 23:42.710
You know, Aspen's the Doggie of the Day.

23:43.190 --> 23:44.771
You sort of look like that when you sleep.

23:44.871 --> 23:45.411
To me?

23:45.511 --> 23:45.711
Yeah.

23:47.112 --> 23:49.554
Wait, wait, is that being mean to Aspen?

23:49.574 --> 23:50.775
No, Aspen looks cute.

23:50.795 --> 23:52.817
Oh, so I look cute when I say things?

23:53.137 --> 23:55.339
Not as cute as Aspen.

23:55.479 --> 23:57.021
Which is it?

23:57.041 --> 24:02.045
FUWAMOCO-chan, how does Aspen BAU BAU?

24:02.425 --> 24:04.527
Definitely a deep, big BAU BAU.

24:04.627 --> 24:05.568
Big BAU BAU.

24:05.888 --> 24:06.188
BAU!

24:07.042 --> 24:07.463
BAU!

24:08.665 --> 24:10.168
I like that one a lot!

24:10.188 --> 24:13.495
Is that a big and deep BAU BAU?

24:13.595 --> 24:15.138
I think it's good.

24:15.178 --> 24:16.861
Especially the BAU BAU after getting...

24:17.678 --> 24:19.159
It's a good rest.

24:19.319 --> 24:20.280
Why?

24:20.320 --> 24:22.281
Sleepy BAU BAU.

24:22.641 --> 24:26.463
You know, I think Aspen, Aspen's a really good buddy.

24:26.883 --> 24:30.425
Reminds us about, you know, the importance of getting a good rest.

24:30.505 --> 24:32.586
About recharging your battery, you know?

24:32.987 --> 24:35.268
Just about enjoying the little things in life.

24:35.328 --> 24:38.850
Like a good zombie going across the sofa.

24:39.370 --> 24:40.551
Doesn't sound like a dog.

24:40.591 --> 24:42.192
He doesn't sound like a frog.

24:43.272 --> 24:44.913
It's a big deep BAU BAU, okay?

24:44.933 --> 24:45.834
Deep BAU BAU, yeah.

24:46.414 --> 24:51.716
You know, I think it's important to have a buddy like Aspen who shows us the important things in life.

24:51.896 --> 24:52.297
Right?

24:52.677 --> 24:56.678
I hope that you're able to cuddle up with Aspen there.

24:56.718 --> 24:57.339
Right?

24:57.979 --> 24:59.440
That would be nice.

24:59.860 --> 25:00.500
Toasty dog.

25:02.281 --> 25:02.981
Thank you!

25:03.081 --> 25:05.582
BAU BAU BAU!

25:05.622 --> 25:09.164
Wow, today Moco-chan really is this ruffy and good.

25:10.151 --> 25:10.872
Let's see!

25:11.592 --> 25:11.993
De-den!

25:13.434 --> 25:13.974
Bananas.

25:14.315 --> 25:15.055
Two bananas.

25:15.195 --> 25:19.999
Twin bananas.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.483
What part of this is an uneventful walk to the grocery store?

25:24.623 --> 25:25.544
You got twin bananas!

25:25.564 --> 25:26.345
They're cute!

25:30.942 --> 25:35.083
I don't know, at first I thought maybe you found the bananas at the grocery store.

25:35.143 --> 25:41.405
But, you know, kind of looking at the background, it seems like maybe you found them along your way.

25:41.425 --> 25:43.145
They look like banana trees, right?

25:43.185 --> 25:46.246
That's really cool.

25:46.326 --> 25:48.827
As soon as you said bananas, I thought of Donkey Kong.

25:48.867 --> 25:49.947
Right?

25:50.447 --> 25:51.047
Bananas!

25:51.107 --> 25:51.747
Bananas!

25:51.787 --> 25:54.108
Maybe this Ruffian lives in Donkey Kong Country.

25:55.646 --> 25:56.086
Maybe not.

25:56.266 --> 25:56.806
Maybe not.

25:57.147 --> 25:58.547
That might not be the safest.

25:59.107 --> 26:01.848
Too many enemies, too much stuff to jump.

26:03.149 --> 26:05.350
But the twin bananas look so cool!

26:06.190 --> 26:08.131
And maybe a little bit delicious too.

26:08.271 --> 26:10.992
Did you eat them?

26:12.452 --> 26:13.513
That would be amazing!

26:13.813 --> 26:16.734
You know, just being able to pick up bananas and then eat them.

26:16.994 --> 26:19.495
I wanna know, did you eat the twin bananas?

26:21.215 --> 26:21.676
I'm curious.

26:21.736 --> 26:22.716
What would it taste like?

26:23.424 --> 26:24.846
Banana peels.

26:37.079 --> 26:47.087
You know Ruffians, sometimes maybe it's a bit hard to get outside and go for a walk, but if you have like a little goal, whether you know it's a grocery store, or maybe... FUWAMOCO Cafe!

26:47.347 --> 26:53.552
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Cafe to see like the water or something pretty, maybe it'll help you get going a little bit easier!

26:54.173 --> 26:54.433
Right?

26:55.421 --> 26:58.944
So next time you're like, I should probably go for a walk, but I don't know if I want to.

26:59.044 --> 26:59.965
Give yourself a goal.

27:00.105 --> 27:00.806
Yeah.

27:00.926 --> 27:04.469
And then go put on your shoes and go!

27:04.509 --> 27:07.331
We're glad you had a beautiful walk!

27:07.551 --> 27:08.652
BAU BAU!

27:08.832 --> 27:11.895
I'm really curious about how the banana tasted though.

27:11.975 --> 27:12.635
Are the bananas?

27:12.695 --> 27:14.437
Is it sweet or sour?

27:14.677 --> 27:16.439
Right.

27:16.559 --> 27:17.299
Sour banana.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.861
Well, what's our question of the day today?

27:20.881 --> 27:22.682
De-den!

27:22.702 --> 27:32.127
I was inspired by your Japanese class with Albert to study a little harder with Japanese.

27:32.587 --> 27:35.989
But sometimes I do get a little stuck on what to focus.

27:36.089 --> 27:40.631
FUWAMOCO-sensei, what do you recommend to use to study to become fluent?

27:40.911 --> 27:42.612
It's a good question.

27:42.973 --> 27:43.213
First,

27:44.193 --> 27:44.854
Ganbatte!

27:45.455 --> 27:48.338
Ganbatte ne!

27:48.358 --> 27:53.583
We understand what you mean by having a hard time focusing on what to study.

27:53.843 --> 27:56.466
It can be a bit overwhelming, right?

27:56.546 --> 28:01.231
I think it's best to just take things little by little at first.

28:01.271 --> 28:04.715
Don't try to force yourself to learn kanji when you're still just getting used to it.

28:04.995 --> 28:06.496
Hiragana katakana still.

28:06.716 --> 28:11.177
I mean that's why for us it took us two years to learn Hiragana katakana.

28:11.458 --> 28:15.419
But for us we really drilled it in so then there's no problems ever.

28:15.499 --> 28:16.319
Right.

28:16.479 --> 28:25.383
And then so when we started learning kanji it was really tough you know because trying to understand it, how it works, kun yomi, oni yomi, different readings.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.111
Kanji is good, though.

28:28.191 --> 28:32.834
It's good, but don't be like, ah, there's so many kanji I have to start now.

28:32.854 --> 28:34.955
Just take it little by little, you know?

28:35.295 --> 28:41.118
But as we're figuring out what to study first, I think we recommend the Genki textbook series.

28:41.158 --> 28:42.799
If you want a bit more structure, you know?

28:42.819 --> 28:48.782
Yeah, you know, I think it'll help you kind of learn at a good pace and not overwhelm you with too many things.

28:48.802 --> 28:49.503
Face-friendly.

28:49.543 --> 28:50.964
Yeah, yeah.

28:51.184 --> 28:53.045
I think maybe refer it

28:53.707 --> 28:54.608
The door is good too.

29:14.941 --> 29:17.143
Yeah, but yeah, no pressure.

29:17.203 --> 29:17.963
Just have fun.

29:18.443 --> 29:19.844
Little by little, you know?

29:20.185 --> 29:24.607
If you stress yourself out and you don't have fun with it, you're not gonna continue, you know?

29:24.748 --> 29:26.689
So, just have fun!

29:26.709 --> 29:27.189
Do your best!

29:27.609 --> 29:28.970
Make mistakes!

29:29.411 --> 29:29.811
BAU BAU!

29:29.831 --> 29:30.792
Ruffians!

29:36.673 --> 29:42.518
I know it's the weekend, but this still means you can make submissions to the hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

29:42.878 --> 29:45.100
We're still looking for more Pero Sightings.

29:45.501 --> 29:46.642
Doggie of the Day.

29:46.662 --> 29:49.224
We want to hear more about your works that you're going on.

29:49.364 --> 29:50.325
And questions!

29:50.745 --> 29:51.566
Questions too!

29:51.626 --> 29:53.527
Please ask us lots of questions.

29:53.928 --> 29:57.991
I think there might be a lot of Ruffians asking with the hashtag Help FUWAMOCO.

29:58.011 --> 29:58.952
That's good too!

29:59.332 --> 30:03.076
But for FUWAMOCO Morning, I think we most appreciate it with the hashtag

30:03.596 --> 30:06.760
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

30:07.521 --> 30:09.284
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

30:09.384 --> 30:10.826
BAU BAU!

30:12.168 --> 30:13.129
Wow, Moco-chan.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.412
Do you know what our next game is?

30:16.173 --> 30:17.775
We have... De-den!

30:18.857 --> 30:22.179
We have Mario Kart 8 to launch with all of us!

30:22.719 --> 30:23.600
Yeah!

30:23.620 --> 30:25.661
Our first time driving, right?

30:25.681 --> 30:30.864
It's time for us to hit the road and get driving because we need to beat Abyss, you know.

30:30.884 --> 30:32.325
We gotta beat them.

30:32.365 --> 30:33.326
We'll use the items.

30:33.706 --> 30:36.648
But I think just driving fast, driving carefully is good.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.550
Fuwawa is gonna drive this time, right?

30:39.570 --> 30:40.570
Moco-chan, you too.

30:41.451 --> 30:42.171
Can I play?

30:42.231 --> 30:43.232
Yeah, you can play.

30:43.432 --> 30:44.172
Am I allowed?

30:44.192 --> 30:44.893
You're allowed.

30:45.900 --> 30:54.288
We talked about it a bit yesterday, but our goal is to beat Biboo.

30:54.328 --> 30:58.673
But I think, you know, first we kind of need to brush up, get a bit prepared.

30:58.713 --> 31:00.134
You know, we want to crush Biboo.

31:00.334 --> 31:01.335
Yeah, crush her!

31:01.736 --> 31:02.657
Crush the rock!

31:05.558 --> 31:06.239
Let's practice!

31:06.279 --> 31:13.367
We're gonna do our best to practice and prepare a little bit and then that way, we can make you Ruffians proud.

31:13.448 --> 31:15.650
Hopefully.

31:16.832 --> 31:19.695
I might not be as good at Mario Kart as I was at Apex, but...

31:20.971 --> 31:21.831
I'll try!

31:22.932 --> 31:24.273
BAU BAU!

31:24.953 --> 31:26.014
And upcoming next!

31:26.634 --> 31:28.495
I schedule!

31:29.095 --> 31:34.178
Next, shortly after I collab with Abbott, we also have a stream.

31:34.678 --> 31:34.958
A game.

31:35.038 --> 31:36.579
We're playing Kanji the Game!

31:37.579 --> 31:38.440
More studying.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.041
Yeah, more studying, right?

31:40.361 --> 31:44.284
This one is going to be at a very different time from our usual streams.

31:44.544 --> 31:48.386
But there will be an archive so don't worry if you can't catch it.

31:48.406 --> 31:53.470
We're going to be studying some really tough kanji and trying to read them as they come at us.

31:54.150 --> 31:56.331
But, it might be really tricky.

31:56.731 --> 31:59.613
We expect to fail a lot.

31:59.813 --> 32:02.234
And you know, with that, we'll learn a lot too.

32:02.514 --> 32:03.814
We'll learn a lot.

32:03.895 --> 32:07.396
In a little bit, we'll be doing a live stream in kanji!

32:07.416 --> 32:12.358
FUWAMOCO is the worst at kanji, but I think this game will be an opportunity for us to learn.

32:12.659 --> 32:16.220
I think we should do it as if it's a study session.

32:16.240 --> 32:16.540
So please,

32:22.833 --> 32:23.573
We're gonna do our best!

32:47.495 --> 32:48.596
After that we have Sakura Boys 5.

32:48.736 --> 32:52.238
I'm really really looking forward to Ruffians.

32:52.278 --> 32:52.839
Please join us.

32:52.859 --> 32:54.319
Please join us.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.380
It's very comfy.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.722
It's very comfy.

32:58.742 --> 33:03.646
FUWAMOCO Morning Episode 20 is going to be coming to an end now, Moco-chan.

33:05.739 --> 33:06.860
It's been so fast.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.061
Another week of FUWAMOCO Morning.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.263
Another week together with the Ruffians.

33:11.503 --> 33:13.204
Thank you for joining us.

33:13.985 --> 33:20.009
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today.
