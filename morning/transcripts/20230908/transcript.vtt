05:02.875 --> 05:05.880
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:07.028 --> 05:11.669
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:11.709 --> 05:12.490
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:12.510 --> 05:12.810
BAU BAU!

05:12.870 --> 05:14.870
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:14.930 --> 05:15.891
I'm not Fuwawa.

05:29.025 --> 05:32.309
I'm Mococo!

05:32.770 --> 05:34.612
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:34.672 --> 05:37.376
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:37.857 --> 05:41.582
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:41.602 --> 05:44.566
Thank you for joining us today for our

05:45.046 --> 05:46.587
17th episode.

05:47.007 --> 05:51.210
Moco-chan, that's almost 30 episodes.

05:52.550 --> 05:53.391
Ruffians!

05:53.651 --> 05:56.993
It's still a bit far away, but it's closer.

05:57.073 --> 05:58.814
It's closer to 30 episodes.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.015
We're close to 30 episodes now.

06:00.035 --> 06:00.355
Episode 17.

06:05.379 --> 06:11.386
I saw that there's some ruffians that are joining us for the first time today, so please let me explain.

06:11.606 --> 06:17.533
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

06:18.914 --> 06:20.475
Spells out FUWAMOCO!

06:20.495 --> 06:24.137
And is hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:24.738 --> 06:30.701
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:31.342 --> 06:36.244
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:36.785 --> 06:40.807
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:40.927 --> 06:43.149
BAU BAU!

06:44.762 --> 06:45.663
I love ruffians!

06:45.983 --> 06:48.166
It's a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:48.667 --> 06:52.432
Has there been any ruffians that might have seen Pero?

06:53.353 --> 06:56.758
I think we have another Pero Sighting!

06:57.378 --> 06:58.580
Where was he again?

06:59.281 --> 06:59.621
Let's see.

07:05.326 --> 07:07.806
This is a very different Pero Sighting.

07:08.727 --> 07:11.167
This Ruffian's brother brought Pero.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.347
Why would you do that?

07:12.367 --> 07:19.769
Right, it's kind of questionable, but you know, I guess they're maybe doing it out of the goodness of their heart.

07:19.789 --> 07:20.829
A kind Ruffian.

07:20.849 --> 07:24.030
Right, you know, like rescue Pero and bring him back to us.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.590
That makes sense, I guess, yeah.

07:27.151 --> 07:28.751
But now he can't find his brother.

07:29.969 --> 07:31.011
Huh?

07:31.071 --> 07:32.153
Has he gone missing?

07:32.173 --> 07:37.483
Do you see anything in this picture that could be a clue, Ruffians?

07:38.700 --> 07:40.081
I see Pero.

07:40.321 --> 07:41.402
Yeah, Pero's there.

07:41.863 --> 07:44.125
Yeah, he looks like his normal self.

07:44.165 --> 07:46.066
Yeah, he looks pretty comfy on your bed.

07:46.126 --> 07:46.787
Yeah, yeah.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.789
And he's admiring himself in your big mirror.

07:50.009 --> 07:50.890
Aw, nice!

07:51.010 --> 07:51.531
Why?

07:51.591 --> 07:53.612
It's nice to have a mirror.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.955
I wonder what he's thinking as he looks at himself in the mirror, you know?

07:57.355 --> 07:57.996
I'm round.

07:58.016 --> 07:59.277
Like, maybe like...

08:01.460 --> 08:04.444
A little bit more like that kind of thing.

08:05.206 --> 08:06.608
I should try to lose some weight.

08:06.648 --> 08:07.570
Because he's round.

08:07.590 --> 08:11.796
He's thinking his next move.

08:14.242 --> 08:15.303
I need more bones!

08:17.685 --> 08:20.487
Is that a thought that you have too, Ruffians?

08:20.507 --> 08:22.149
Is that a self-improvement?

08:22.349 --> 08:23.289
I need more bones.

08:23.370 --> 08:27.373
I should get some more bones in my body.

08:27.853 --> 08:36.220
I wonder though, with all those kind of anxieties, what kind of motivation does Pero have for self-improvement?

08:36.760 --> 08:40.863
Maybe that's why he's going so many different places and not staying here with us.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.025
Self-improvement!

08:43.045 --> 08:47.988
Thank you for bringing him in, Ruffians!

08:48.148 --> 08:50.169
We said that he enjoyed your bed.

08:50.669 --> 08:52.690
It looks very fluffy!

08:53.090 --> 08:56.311
And I'm sure if you found Pero, I'm sure you'll find your brother again.

08:56.371 --> 08:58.452
Very, very good at finding things.

08:58.492 --> 08:59.173
Right, Ruffians?

09:00.953 --> 09:02.034
Hang in there!

09:02.134 --> 09:03.614
BAU BAU!

09:03.974 --> 09:07.155
Please, Ruffians, let us know if you see Pero, okay?

09:07.175 --> 09:08.836
Remember to use the hashtag!

09:09.156 --> 09:13.877
Hashtag FWMCMORNING if you spot him, okay?

09:14.217 --> 09:14.997
Thank you!

09:15.057 --> 09:16.738
BAU BAU!

09:18.194 --> 09:23.278
That was kind of a different one, right Moco-chan?

09:23.338 --> 09:31.584
Well, I think some Ruffians may not, but we do have a super fun weekend ahead of us!

09:32.204 --> 09:37.608
You know we have the Japanese Classroom with Advent and our Rock n' Rawr Party, but... Tomorrow!

09:37.908 --> 09:38.449
Tomorrow!

09:38.509 --> 09:40.690
Not today.

09:40.970 --> 09:45.594
Tomorrow!

09:45.954 --> 09:47.075
What's tomorrow, Moco-chan?

09:47.952 --> 09:54.376
We are having our very first membership stream for the Doggy Pack!

09:55.917 --> 10:00.200
Membership with the Doggy Pack!

10:00.621 --> 10:07.986
Well, Ruffians, if you're part of the Doggy Pack, we think you might have seen our cute emos.

10:08.986 --> 10:10.307
You've been enjoying them, right?

10:11.826 --> 10:19.269
Doggy Pack has been, but if you join the Doggy Pack we have a bunch of cute emotes and membership badges.

10:19.869 --> 10:28.092
Membership badge, maybe there's some Ruffians that aren't too sure, but the membership badge goes with you as you are a member of the Doggy Pack.

10:28.232 --> 10:31.733
And then the emotes, they're just cute and we can use them all together.

10:31.753 --> 10:34.554
We can BAU BAU and you win.

10:34.614 --> 10:35.435
But, you know,

10:36.195 --> 10:42.624
We're planning to have even more emotes in the future, so we hope that you'll look forward to those ones too.

10:42.644 --> 10:48.452
But more importantly, we have our first membership stream.

10:48.853 --> 10:50.255
Yes, what is it, Moco-chan?

10:52.227 --> 10:54.408
Battle plan!

10:54.829 --> 10:57.550
We're gonna be having a battle plan, you know?

10:57.790 --> 11:00.191
And we wanted to do something special.

11:00.211 --> 11:04.434
You know, something that would be comfy, where we can get close together.

11:04.514 --> 11:11.637
And we thought it would be a good time to take a moment to sit down and kind of figure out a battle plan all together.

11:11.657 --> 11:16.580
Because Ruffians, you remember during our debut we had a big list of goals and dreams, right?

11:16.600 --> 11:18.141
Yeah, all our goals and dreams, right?

11:18.181 --> 11:18.321
Yeah.

11:19.041 --> 11:24.765
Well, we're working on making this happen, but we wanted to sort of know what you think you'd like to see first.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.346
Because we can't focus on everything at once, right?

11:27.386 --> 11:29.408
There's over a hundred of them.

11:29.768 --> 11:33.090
So let's take little steps towards some at a time.

11:33.730 --> 11:40.515
I'm curious though, I want to know which ones you're most excited for us to accomplish all together.

11:40.655 --> 11:45.618
So let's all put our heads together and figure out what we can do to make them come true, okay?

11:46.558 --> 11:49.161
Ruffians, make sure you start planning now, okay?

11:49.501 --> 11:52.283
It's tomorrow, so... Are you just trying to make them do all the work?

11:52.303 --> 11:54.965
No, it's a group effort, you know?

11:55.065 --> 11:57.767
We can accomplish our dreams all together, no?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.569
We can't just do it the two of us.

11:59.629 --> 12:02.111
FUWAMOCO alone... No.

12:02.411 --> 12:03.412
We need the ruffians.

12:03.452 --> 12:04.753
We need the ruffians.

12:05.814 --> 12:10.257
So, on that note, you know, maybe you're not a part of the Doggy Pack yet,

12:11.417 --> 12:19.123
I would say just from a personal standpoint, not as Fuwawa, that it would be a very good time to join.

12:19.784 --> 12:22.686
Because you won't miss our first stream then.

12:23.907 --> 12:30.272
And we've already done a couple little things, but we have some plans to make the Doggy Pack pretty special.

12:30.872 --> 12:31.833
You might not know what it is.

12:33.354 --> 12:33.974
We recommend.

12:34.334 --> 12:35.955
BAU BAU!

12:36.015 --> 12:38.315
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:38.355 --> 12:40.016
Let's plan ahead, okay?

12:40.056 --> 12:41.716
We're looking forward to it.

12:41.776 --> 12:42.637
Thank you!

12:42.697 --> 12:45.217
BAU BAU!

12:45.237 --> 12:46.898
BAU BAU!

12:47.378 --> 12:47.738
Next!

12:48.218 --> 12:56.640
Well... Unfortunately... There's been another misunderstanding.

12:58.981 --> 13:00.582
Why do we keep on having misunderstandings?

13:00.662 --> 13:01.382
Why?

13:05.207 --> 13:07.530
I guess... Ah, that's right.

13:08.851 --> 13:13.276
This time... This time it wasn't our misunderstanding.

13:13.777 --> 13:15.939
It wasn't the Ruffians' misunderstanding.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.045
It was Abyss' misunderstanding.

13:21.185 --> 13:21.565
You know?

13:26.145 --> 13:31.029
They think that Fuwawa doesn't exist and it's just a part of my imagination.

13:31.089 --> 13:31.509
I know.

13:32.030 --> 13:41.677
You know, in the Minecraft collab we had the other day, the Advent members, they started to say that Fuwawa doesn't exist and that she's just a part of my imagination.

13:41.737 --> 13:46.841
But, you know, I've also seen other comments saying that we're just two parts of a gamer.

13:46.861 --> 13:49.263
The backseater and the toxic one.

13:49.423 --> 13:50.104
No!

13:50.524 --> 13:51.785
And that's not true either.

13:51.925 --> 13:53.146
Not true.

13:53.186 --> 13:54.507
You know, Fuwawa exists.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.047
She's right here!

13:57.268 --> 13:59.128
Ruffians, I'm real, right?

13:59.348 --> 14:00.889
You understand, right?

14:01.329 --> 14:01.969
You believe me?

14:02.089 --> 14:04.350
I'm real?

14:04.550 --> 14:09.051
You don't have to ask the ruffians if you're real.

14:09.131 --> 14:11.431
I just want to check, you know?

14:11.471 --> 14:12.332
You just want to check?

14:12.372 --> 14:13.512
Who's Fuwawa?

14:13.632 --> 14:14.692
Who's Fuwawa?

14:14.732 --> 14:16.073
Who's Fuwawa?

14:16.093 --> 14:20.734
Why do you keep on saying that, ruffians?

14:24.714 --> 14:26.357
I don't know what to believe anymore.

14:27.018 --> 14:27.900
She's right here!

14:27.920 --> 14:29.082
She's on my right!

14:29.162 --> 14:30.284
I mean my left!

14:37.645 --> 14:39.026
Yeah, left.

14:40.846 --> 14:47.789
I guess I could kind of see how the other avid members felt like I was just a voice in their heads when we were, you know, playing Minecraft?

14:47.809 --> 14:48.629
Yeah, yeah.

14:48.889 --> 14:54.151
We only have Moco-chan's body on screen, so yeah, it would be maybe a bit confusing.

14:54.191 --> 14:54.651
Yeah, I guess.

14:56.462 --> 15:02.868
Well, hopefully we'll have a solution to this misunderstanding soon, but for now, Ruffians!

15:03.869 --> 15:04.930
You understand, right?

15:05.411 --> 15:06.532
You don't, right?

15:07.312 --> 15:08.694
You understand, right?

15:09.535 --> 15:10.556
The huawawa's here.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.377
No more huawawa!

15:12.417 --> 15:13.478
She's here with us.

15:14.279 --> 15:15.460
I'm in this room!

15:15.841 --> 15:17.442
I'm in the studio this morning!

15:21.701 --> 15:23.042
It's okay, Mococo!

15:23.362 --> 15:24.063
Understood!

15:24.703 --> 15:25.624
Yes!

15:25.824 --> 15:26.384
Good!

15:26.685 --> 15:27.125
Good!

15:28.126 --> 15:28.966
Understood.

15:29.827 --> 15:30.827
I'm still concerned.

15:31.948 --> 15:32.188
Why?

15:34.089 --> 15:34.750
Moco-chan.

15:35.590 --> 15:37.091
I don't know what to believe anymore.

15:37.111 --> 15:42.495
But... For now... I guess we're okay.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.074
I believe in my life!

15:47.234 --> 15:48.174
It's real!

15:48.514 --> 15:49.554
Okay, okay.

15:49.895 --> 15:55.716
You believe in me like the support kind, not like the I believe in ghosts kind, right?

15:58.637 --> 15:59.878
Ruffians?

16:02.379 --> 16:03.219
Yes, yes.

16:03.259 --> 16:04.519
BAU BAU!

16:04.539 --> 16:07.600
No more misunderstanding.

16:07.660 --> 16:07.920
It's good.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.181
Understood.

16:16.545 --> 16:17.086
Next!

16:18.134 --> 16:24.696
Ruffians, we'd like to have Moco-chan share something very important with you.

16:25.036 --> 16:27.817
Maybe a new corner?

16:29.117 --> 16:36.159
Well, you know, before you head out today, I think, you know, Moco-chan, it'd be good if she kind of lets you know what to prepare for, you know?

16:36.199 --> 16:38.020
Like if you need to prepare for the day.

16:38.040 --> 16:44.182
Yeah, like if you need an umbrella with you, if you should dress in short sleeves, because it's time for...

16:47.210 --> 16:49.091
Moco-chan's Knees Plank!

16:50.332 --> 16:51.433
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

16:53.494 --> 16:53.734
Yes.

16:54.434 --> 16:54.995
Thank you.

16:55.555 --> 17:01.078
Thank you for that wonderful introduction, my sister and fellow announcer, Fuwawa.

17:01.178 --> 17:01.719
Well, you're welcome.

17:02.139 --> 17:03.320
Yes, you're welcome.

17:04.710 --> 17:18.041
Yes, like discussed in this corner, I, Mococo Abyssgard, will alert you to upcoming and important news which will affect your life and your heart very deeply.

17:18.701 --> 17:26.147
Listen up, because it's time for Moco-chan's Sneeze Forecast.

17:27.849 --> 17:30.711
Today, the forecast calls for...

17:34.603 --> 17:37.305
A very sunny and sneezy time.

17:39.386 --> 17:44.628
But it seems like some sort of pressure system continues throughout the area.

17:45.329 --> 17:47.950
Hopefully we will have relief throughout the weekend.

17:48.290 --> 17:52.852
But you know how the weather and allergies can be sometimes, you know?

17:53.933 --> 17:58.895
But we will keep you posted regarding further updates on the sneeze forecast.

18:00.196 --> 18:00.576
Thank you.

18:01.840 --> 18:09.291
This has been a Moco-chan sneeze forecast.

18:10.954 --> 18:14.018
Now back to my sister, Fuwawa Abyssgard.

18:14.299 --> 18:17.784
This is Mococo Abyssgard, signing off.

18:24.808 --> 18:27.591
Did you enjoy my professional sneeze forecast?

18:27.651 --> 18:28.612
Very, very much.

18:28.853 --> 18:29.834
Very, very much.

18:30.054 --> 18:30.374
Right?

18:30.534 --> 18:32.857
Professional transitions, right?

18:33.077 --> 18:34.518
Yes.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.000
I think it was a...

18:37.018 --> 18:39.539
A sneezy day the other day, right?

18:39.559 --> 18:40.040
Just a bit.

18:40.060 --> 18:40.580
Just a bit.

18:40.660 --> 18:41.780
Maybe this weekend too.

18:42.401 --> 18:43.801
Never know with the weather.

18:43.861 --> 18:44.102
Right?

18:44.322 --> 18:45.922
The sneeze forecast, right?

18:49.684 --> 18:55.967
Well, I think all the Ruffians may know what else we have planned for today, right?

18:56.047 --> 18:58.729
Right, it's a very important day today.

18:59.229 --> 19:00.890
It's the day, Ruffians!

19:01.050 --> 19:02.210
It's the day!

19:02.270 --> 19:03.511
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

19:03.551 --> 19:05.612
It's time for...

19:06.303 --> 19:10.787
FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle!

19:11.347 --> 19:19.454
Today, we'll be deciding on the jingle that we'll be using during FUWAMOCO Morning from every day on!

19:19.994 --> 19:21.776
Are you excited?

19:25.639 --> 19:34.247
Well, you know, a little more than a week ago, we asked you Ruffians for an original jingle for FUWAMOCO Morning.

19:34.727 --> 19:40.433
We wanted to be able to make something special all together since FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that, you know,

19:41.113 --> 19:42.153
It's us and you.

19:42.273 --> 19:43.794
It's a show we make all together.

19:43.814 --> 19:47.555
That's why we're asking for your submissions.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.675
We're always asking for your submissions.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.995
It's very important to us.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.956
It's us together.

19:52.976 --> 19:55.016
That's what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

19:55.196 --> 19:57.637
We're just hosting it.

19:59.558 --> 20:04.119
We thought that a jingle made by you would be the perfect thing to start our show.

20:06.365 --> 20:08.548
We really wanted to say thank you, Ruffians.

20:08.588 --> 20:11.312
Thank you so much for all your submissions!

20:11.452 --> 20:13.134
It's a group effort together, right?

20:13.154 --> 20:16.819
We really love listening to every single one of them!

20:17.944 --> 20:28.675
Once more, please let us say a big, big thank you to every single ruffian that made a jingle for FUWAMOCO Morning.

20:28.915 --> 20:30.036
We really appreciate it.

20:30.056 --> 20:32.879
It was really hard to select just one.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.941
It really, really was!

20:35.221 --> 20:36.342
We weren't fighting, nope.

20:37.904 --> 20:42.330
Each one is so unique and wonderful.

20:42.390 --> 20:44.914
It has a Ruffian's personality.

20:44.974 --> 20:46.696
I've had so many stuck in my head!

20:48.806 --> 20:49.767
Very, very good.

20:50.347 --> 20:53.389
Ruffians are just very, very impressive.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.790
Right?

20:54.890 --> 20:58.952
First, we'd like to showcase some more jingles with you today.

20:59.072 --> 21:02.534
Since today is the last day, we have quite a number of them.

21:02.734 --> 21:03.855
Are you ready?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.576
I'm going to listen to them.

21:06.096 --> 21:08.017
So you have to be like this, okay?

21:08.137 --> 21:11.479
Put your headphones on, listen very closely, okay?

21:16.797 --> 21:23.248
First, today we have a jingle from this ruffian.

21:23.889 --> 21:26.072
From Mighty Junkie!

21:26.092 --> 21:27.835
Let's have a listen, Moco-chan.

21:41.749 --> 21:49.005
They definitely caught the energy and the feeling of waking up to a new morning with FUWAMOCO Morning!

21:49.815 --> 21:50.315
So cute.

21:50.355 --> 21:52.756
I feel like I could skip to it, you know?

21:52.796 --> 21:54.177
Skip?

21:54.217 --> 22:02.281
You know, and Moco-chan was like, oh we should have a jingle that's like... Right?

22:02.601 --> 22:02.921
Right?

22:03.161 --> 22:04.001
Maybe, yeah.

22:04.261 --> 22:08.944
Yeah, but you know, I feel like it has a little bit less of that, which is good!

22:08.964 --> 22:13.025
Because I feel like that could be like a dubstep morning.

22:13.205 --> 22:15.026
What's wrong with Unchinomorning?

22:15.066 --> 22:16.027
I don't think that's quite...

22:16.807 --> 22:22.493
Quite maybe what at least I was envisioning, but... I really, really like it.

22:22.733 --> 22:23.574
Thank you!

22:24.094 --> 22:26.156
Thank you Mighty Donkey!

22:26.176 --> 22:27.818
BAU BAU!

22:27.838 --> 22:32.383
And next we have a jingle from... Nea!

22:33.264 --> 22:34.885
BAU BAU!

22:34.905 --> 22:36.166
Let's take a listen.

22:48.174 --> 22:51.296
Oh, it feels... it feels... fluffy!

22:51.397 --> 22:54.759
No, it's like fluffy in a jingle for a night.

22:58.802 --> 22:59.343
I love it.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.144
It introduces each of us.

23:01.584 --> 23:03.845
I go BAU BAU.

23:04.026 --> 23:05.246
You go BAU BAU, right?

23:06.267 --> 23:07.728
I'm your host, BAU BAU.

23:08.108 --> 23:09.169
Me too, BAU BAU.

23:09.209 --> 23:10.890
Just like that, you know?

23:11.310 --> 23:12.551
It's really cute.

23:13.031 --> 23:17.794
I can kind of see puppies playing around and tripping over each other, you know?

23:17.994 --> 23:19.075
A train jingle.

23:19.095 --> 23:21.296
A train jingle?

23:21.576 --> 23:22.197
Tapi tapi.

23:22.217 --> 23:22.637
Tapioca.

23:26.099 --> 23:26.640
It could be.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.623
You have the same sort of fun feeling, you know?

23:29.643 --> 23:30.725
Fun but relaxing.

23:31.906 --> 23:32.587
Thank you!

23:33.208 --> 23:36.592
BAU BAU!

23:37.313 --> 23:42.399
And this next single, this is from Ghost Toast!

23:43.039 --> 23:43.660
Let's listen.

23:44.321 --> 23:45.542
What does Ghost Toast have for us?

23:58.401 --> 23:58.621
Oh!

23:59.704 --> 24:01.428
It's smooth!

24:02.310 --> 24:03.313
Oh, jazzy!

24:04.830 --> 24:05.370
Sexy.

24:06.190 --> 24:09.371
FUWAMOCO Sexy Morning!

24:09.471 --> 24:13.691
I like it!

24:14.092 --> 24:19.973
You know, Ruffians, it's like a jazzy saxophone feel.

24:19.993 --> 24:21.393
I like the part where I say today.

24:21.533 --> 24:22.393
Right?

24:22.413 --> 24:28.814
Moco-chan, you kind of come out of nowhere, but it's surprisingly fitting, like the today!

24:28.854 --> 24:30.314
Today!

24:30.934 --> 24:33.875
I don't know, Moco-chan, have you ever thought of becoming a jazz singer?

24:35.233 --> 24:36.895
Yes.

24:37.295 --> 24:41.439
The Ruffians may not know, but I seriously pursued it at one point.

24:42.360 --> 24:42.620
I did.

24:43.041 --> 24:48.826
That's the first time I've heard about this.

24:49.147 --> 24:49.948
Interesting.

24:50.108 --> 24:54.772
I really really like it when saxophones are used during anime songs.

24:55.133 --> 24:57.996
It makes my heartbeat really high and sometimes I cry.

24:58.977 --> 25:00.518
This part!

25:00.558 --> 25:01.999
This part is my favorite!

25:02.019 --> 25:05.663
There's one song that has a saxophone solo.

25:05.823 --> 25:10.648
And it's just like, maybe 5 seconds, but somehow it just gets to me.

25:10.708 --> 25:14.712
I just skip to that part in the song.

25:16.273 --> 25:18.814
Thank you so much, Ghost Toast!

25:18.994 --> 25:20.375
It was very smooth.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.655
BAU BAU!

25:21.675 --> 25:23.116
Smooth Toast.

25:23.316 --> 25:24.837
Smooth Toast.

25:26.097 --> 25:27.338
Our next one!

25:28.158 --> 25:31.239
This jingle is from a ruffian named Yunoxa.

25:31.859 --> 25:32.560
Let's listen.

25:32.640 --> 25:32.800
Hi!

25:44.295 --> 25:45.335
Thank you!

25:45.436 --> 25:46.456
Thank you!

25:47.576 --> 25:49.137
It's like a synthwave.

25:49.177 --> 25:53.239
You said it's a synthwave kind of sound.

25:53.379 --> 25:55.500
It feels nostalgic, right?

25:55.540 --> 25:57.321
Like a bit city pop?

25:57.341 --> 25:58.041
I like it!

25:58.381 --> 26:02.023
Nostalgic, but cute and modern at the same time, right?

26:03.215 --> 26:10.517
It makes me want to howl and blast it from a non-existent car in a non-existent timeline.

26:10.537 --> 26:13.897
Maybe when we're back in a different kind of 80s.

26:13.997 --> 26:17.638
A different kind of 80s, not an actual 80s.

26:17.758 --> 26:18.598
A different one, you know?

26:18.678 --> 26:21.499
I really like that BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

26:22.019 --> 26:23.199
It's cute, right?

26:24.239 --> 26:25.800
Right strong 80s vibe.

26:25.820 --> 26:26.920
Thank you so much!

26:27.860 --> 26:29.260
Thank you!

26:29.320 --> 26:31.721
That was so BAU BAU!

26:32.861 --> 26:36.885
And our next is from Name!

26:36.905 --> 26:39.467
Let's give it a listen.

26:41.749 --> 26:42.850
One moment, one moment.

26:56.770 --> 26:58.271
It's happy!

26:58.611 --> 26:59.852
It's colorful!

27:00.953 --> 27:02.935
Did you hear at the beginning, Moco-chan?

27:03.295 --> 27:08.059
It's not like a shocking alarm, but like a very subtle morning alarm in the beginning.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.622
If a morning alarm could be relaxing, that would be it.

27:11.662 --> 27:12.864
That would be it, right?

27:13.044 --> 27:18.889
It's kind, because I know Moco-chan, sometimes when you hear special affection songs, you kind of get a bit like...

27:22.336 --> 27:22.956
The knocking.

27:22.976 --> 27:27.438
The knocking sounds, yeah.

27:27.718 --> 27:30.739
You know, I think there was a lot of thought that went into this one.

27:30.779 --> 27:34.720
Especially because the alarm, you know, you wake up and it's FUWAMOCO Morning.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.441
You know, I feel like it's very kind.

27:37.741 --> 27:40.001
Kind and gentle.

27:40.021 --> 27:44.943
It's like the beginning to another FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:45.003 --> 27:46.843
Thank you so much!

27:46.903 --> 27:48.544
BAU BAU!

27:50.208 --> 27:52.151
And our next is from Craver!

27:52.171 --> 27:52.973
Let's listen.

28:06.212 --> 28:08.694
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

28:08.794 --> 28:11.636
It's so good!

28:12.056 --> 28:14.938
Oh my gosh, I'm smiling really hard.

28:14.958 --> 28:15.878
The BAU!

28:15.938 --> 28:18.720
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

28:18.740 --> 28:23.863
It sounds like a kind of futuristic sound too, right?

28:24.183 --> 28:25.304
At the beginning, right?

28:25.364 --> 28:27.686
And it leads up to the climaxing BAU!

28:30.328 --> 28:35.311
Very high energy, right?

28:35.672 --> 28:36.652
Chewy morning.

28:37.273 --> 28:40.515
Too cute.

28:40.535 --> 28:41.296
Very cute.

28:41.556 --> 28:42.397
Thank you!

28:42.517 --> 28:44.498
Thank you so much!

28:44.538 --> 28:45.539
Thank you, Kevin!

28:45.579 --> 28:47.241
BAU BAU!

28:49.122 --> 28:55.027
And the next Ruffians who sent us their jingle is... DACAS!

28:55.907 --> 28:56.628
Listen!

28:59.634 --> 29:01.675
FUWAMOCO Morning!

29:01.915 --> 29:12.417
Thank you for joining us!

29:12.617 --> 29:15.958
This one is like, the jingle!

29:16.038 --> 29:19.139
Good morning!

29:19.199 --> 29:20.239
Like a morning show!

29:20.439 --> 29:21.400
Yeah!

29:21.460 --> 29:22.460
We need to get up.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.140
Sofa.

29:23.160 --> 29:36.786
You know, in our studio we don't have a sofa, but I feel like, you know, after that kind of jingle, we need to sit down on our sofa, get really casual, you know, just, hey there Ruffians, you got your puppuccino?

29:37.006 --> 29:37.686
Heart to heart.

29:37.806 --> 29:38.426
Ready for this?

29:38.546 --> 29:39.287
Okay, let's go.

29:39.307 --> 29:40.667
FUWAMOCO Morning.

29:40.687 --> 29:42.228
Are you talking like a podcast?

29:43.068 --> 29:47.590
Not like a podcast, you know, but just like a, this is a morning together.

29:48.658 --> 29:51.099
Alright!

29:53.461 --> 29:54.201
Just like that.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.703
Thank you so much!

29:57.763 --> 30:01.285
The trumpet was so cool too.

30:01.585 --> 30:03.826
It has so much of your personality.

30:03.886 --> 30:04.747
I'm loving it.

30:05.287 --> 30:06.568
Thank you darling!

30:06.608 --> 30:09.029
BAU BAU!

30:10.249 --> 30:11.930
And finally, we have...

30:14.218 --> 30:17.931
The last single here, this is from ZUN!

30:18.031 --> 30:18.332
Listen!

30:18.673 --> 30:19.055
Go away!

30:28.937 --> 30:30.859
Thank you!

30:30.879 --> 30:36.903
It has a school bell sound in it, but it's different from the traditional one.

30:37.204 --> 30:39.806
It's happy, it's not like a stressful thing.

30:40.146 --> 30:42.628
King Kong, King Kong.

30:42.668 --> 30:45.210
The good start to the morning.

30:45.350 --> 30:47.292
Very cool, very exciting.

30:50.214 --> 30:53.236
I don't know, I kind of could see it played at a club.

30:53.316 --> 30:57.818
Maybe my understanding of what a club is a bit different than the actual ones.

30:58.618 --> 31:00.419
Right?

31:00.439 --> 31:04.181
You know, it kind of feels like... Oh, this is a good thing.

31:04.381 --> 31:06.542
Like a computer virus.

31:07.323 --> 31:17.208
Yeah, that way... Moco-chan, do what... If I was a computer virus, I would spy on the ruffians.

31:18.328 --> 31:20.730
It makes you want to become a computer virus.

31:20.870 --> 31:25.834
Thank you!

31:26.615 --> 31:31.259
BAU BAU!

31:31.820 --> 31:35.463
So many wonderful, wonderful submissions.

31:36.083 --> 31:39.146
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

31:39.626 --> 31:41.268
You made our job really tough.

31:41.288 --> 31:41.468
Well...

31:45.831 --> 31:48.692
Now, it's that time of year.

31:49.212 --> 31:56.475
We'd like to next present you with the FUWAMOCO Morning jingle that we've selected for the show from here on out.

31:56.615 --> 32:08.379
It'll be making its full debut at the start of next week's FUWAMOCO Morning, and we hope to be able to use it many, many times from here on out as an important part of FUWAMOCO Morning history.

32:08.419 --> 32:12.561
You know, we really wanted to hear

32:13.141 --> 32:18.787
Lots of jingles from all different types of ruffians, you know, with different experiences and different skill levels.

32:18.887 --> 32:21.870
And you know, we're really happy because we were able to see that!

32:22.030 --> 32:23.131
Thank you!

32:23.311 --> 32:24.212
Exactly that.

32:24.833 --> 32:29.398
We saw lots of submissions from skilled musicians and just fudgling with you.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.321
Magicians!

32:32.341 --> 32:35.724
Killed musicians and fledged musicians.

32:35.744 --> 32:39.588
Fledged musicians.

32:39.608 --> 32:41.090
Magicians, I'm sure they could do that.

32:41.130 --> 32:42.331
Magicians can do anything.

32:45.556 --> 32:53.339
We're really really happy to just be, you know, a small part of your musical journey from here on out.

32:53.559 --> 32:58.862
We hope, Ruffians, that you understand just how hard of a decision it was for us to make.

32:59.262 --> 33:06.925
And that, you know, regardless of who is the FUWAMOCO Morning jingle from here on out today, that you continue to create lots and lots

33:07.285 --> 33:10.386
And never, ever, ever give up on your journey, okay?

33:10.586 --> 33:11.907
Always continue, okay?

33:11.947 --> 33:12.147
Yeah.

33:12.447 --> 33:15.388
We want to be able to hear much more of your music, okay?

33:15.688 --> 33:16.088
Okay.

33:16.548 --> 33:17.049
Got it.

33:17.949 --> 33:18.389
All good.

33:19.049 --> 33:21.510
You better let us listen to your music, okay?

33:22.030 --> 33:22.711
That's a threat.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.392
Okay!

33:25.952 --> 33:28.733
Well, I think we've made you wait long enough.

33:29.513 --> 33:31.754
Ruffians, did you want to hear it?

33:33.188 --> 33:33.809
Here we go!

33:33.969 --> 33:37.051
I'm really nervous!

33:37.171 --> 33:37.792
I'm nervous!

33:37.812 --> 33:38.953
I don't know it!

33:39.633 --> 33:42.215
Here's FUWAMOCO Morning's jingle!

33:42.235 --> 33:43.757
Let's have a listen.

33:44.097 --> 33:45.058
Okay, we're gonna listen first.

33:45.078 --> 33:45.698
We're gonna listen first.

33:45.738 --> 33:46.399
Okay, we're gonna listen.

33:46.419 --> 33:47.480
You're not gonna know anything.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.220
We're gonna listen.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.161
Where's the jumble?

33:49.181 --> 33:49.381
Done!

34:07.574 --> 34:08.455
Thank you!

34:09.195 --> 34:13.819
This single was created by SIRENAS!

34:13.859 --> 34:16.362
Thank you!

34:16.482 --> 34:22.066
I love how warm and energetic but not like exploding energy.

34:22.227 --> 34:25.630
You're still sort of maybe just a bit sleepy but ready for the day.

34:25.710 --> 34:29.293
Right, and the melody is so catchy too.

34:29.333 --> 34:33.136
You know, it really feels like the start of something new all together.

34:33.156 --> 34:33.556
Right!

34:34.897 --> 34:38.940
Like waking up to a new story on a brand new day.

34:39.020 --> 34:40.601
And it's FUWAMOCO Morning!

34:40.701 --> 34:41.442
Exactly!

34:42.502 --> 34:47.425
And that's why we selected this as the jingle for FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:47.706 --> 34:53.890
We really feel like it fits the concept and has all our hopes and dreams all rolled up into it.

34:53.970 --> 34:56.231
All those that we have for FUWAMOCO Morning.

34:57.612 --> 35:02.557
Ruffians, we hope that you'll love this jingle just as much as we do from here on out.

35:03.498 --> 35:07.442
BAU BAU!

35:07.622 --> 35:08.163
Thank you!

35:08.183 --> 35:10.245
Thank you for the lovely jingle!

35:10.365 --> 35:13.688
We promise to use it with lots and lots of love every time.

35:14.069 --> 35:14.949
Lots and lots.

35:15.110 --> 35:15.991
It's a promise.

35:16.111 --> 35:18.153
BAU BAU!

35:18.353 --> 35:19.414
Thank you!

35:20.235 --> 35:21.036
Congratulations!

35:22.196 --> 35:23.317
And there it is!

35:23.337 --> 35:26.318
The FUWAMOCO Morning Jingle.

35:26.358 --> 35:30.700
Thank you again, Ruffians, for all your creative love and passion.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.881
We really, really enjoyed it.

35:32.981 --> 35:36.443
So we hope you had just as fun of an experience as they did.

35:36.963 --> 35:39.004
Thank you, FUWAMOCO!

35:39.024 --> 35:41.604
Well next, we'll be moving to our regular corners.

35:41.624 --> 35:42.665
First, we have our Doggie of the Day!

35:42.685 --> 35:43.265
Who's the Doggie?

35:43.285 --> 35:45.266
Who's the Doggie of the Day?

35:45.426 --> 35:53.108
It's... BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

35:54.609 --> 35:56.590
He's so tiny and cute!

35:56.610 --> 35:57.831
He looks like a little flower.

35:57.851 --> 35:58.992
Yeah, but he's a boss.

36:00.033 --> 36:00.373
Boss.

36:00.673 --> 36:02.154
Don't mess with him, you know.

36:02.455 --> 36:05.056
Especially in his Dragon Ball gig.

36:05.156 --> 36:06.197
He's serious.

36:06.257 --> 36:09.760
Boss is named Boss because he gets everything he wants.

36:09.780 --> 36:11.161
I can see the little tongue.

36:11.241 --> 36:13.322
Yeah, that means he gets everything.

36:13.622 --> 36:14.603
Everything, you know.

36:15.003 --> 36:15.764
Head pads.

36:16.144 --> 36:17.005
Belly rubs.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.067
Food.

36:18.167 --> 36:18.888
Playtime.

36:18.928 --> 36:19.448
Nice life.

36:19.709 --> 36:20.269
Alright.

36:20.330 --> 36:23.013
Moco-chan, do you think maybe we should have been named Boss?

36:23.974 --> 36:24.234
Yeah.

36:25.236 --> 36:26.357
Boss Moco-chan.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.679
We'd just be like Boss Boss.

36:27.819 --> 36:28.380
Boss Boss.

36:29.355 --> 36:29.995
BAU BAU!

36:30.075 --> 36:31.236
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:31.316 --> 36:33.157
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:33.177 --> 36:34.218
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:34.278 --> 36:37.720
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:37.860 --> 36:38.780
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.621
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:39.701 --> 36:40.561
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:40.641 --> 36:41.542
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:41.562 --> 36:42.462
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:42.482 --> 36:43.743
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:43.763 --> 36:44.863
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:44.943 --> 36:45.784
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:45.804 --> 36:46.804
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:46.824 --> 36:49.366
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:49.386 --> 36:51.347
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:51.547 --> 36:52.467
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:52.487 --> 36:53.708
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:53.868 --> 36:55.669
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:55.729 --> 36:56.450
It's time for another... BAU BAU!

36:56.490 --> 36:57.090
It's time for another... B

36:58.149 --> 37:01.011
I feel like it's more of like a high-pitched BAU BAU.

37:01.491 --> 37:04.313
I feel like he likes to BAU BAU with his tongue.

37:04.894 --> 37:11.358
So it's like... There's two different BAU BAUs for sure.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.561
You know, boss is the boss.

37:15.921 --> 37:16.982
Can't say no.

37:17.062 --> 37:18.923
Can't argue with the tongue.

37:19.343 --> 37:20.904
Tongue BAU BAU.

37:21.285 --> 37:23.086
He is THE BOSS!

37:23.526 --> 37:24.547
BAU BAU BOSS!

37:29.950 --> 37:37.416
Not just bosses on a walk, but I think there was a ruffian that went on a walk for us today!

37:37.756 --> 37:40.958
Where?

37:41.338 --> 37:42.479
A beautiful fountain!

37:42.739 --> 37:46.742
Look at those BAU-tiful blue skies!

37:46.862 --> 37:50.965
I don't know about you ruffians, but I get very excited over good blue skies.

37:52.086 --> 37:54.708
Moco-chan, you were kind of thinking about...

37:55.328 --> 37:57.669
Going for a walk and just kinda... I didn't say anything.

37:57.689 --> 37:58.810
Skipping out of FUWAMOCO Morning.

37:58.870 --> 37:59.931
I didn't say anything.

37:59.971 --> 38:01.491
Like, Fuwawa, let's just skip!

38:01.752 --> 38:02.572
I wanna go out!

38:02.632 --> 38:04.253
It's not okay.

38:04.693 --> 38:05.534
It's not okay.

38:05.614 --> 38:06.514
I would never skip.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.355
It's okay.

38:07.395 --> 38:10.736
But we're really glad that you went on a walk around your office.

38:10.916 --> 38:14.698
It's really important for you to get up and move throughout your day.

38:14.738 --> 38:15.219
Right.

38:15.499 --> 38:18.200
And I think, you know, a good walk will help you clear your mind.

38:18.260 --> 38:18.661
Relax.

38:18.701 --> 38:21.382
Just get a bit more of a refreshment.

38:21.402 --> 38:21.702
Refreshness.

38:21.762 --> 38:22.663
Fill your lungs.

38:23.183 --> 38:25.524
We hope that the food check you stopped at was yummy too.

38:25.644 --> 38:28.586
I think it sounds like it was an extra pleasant work day.

38:42.152 --> 38:45.454
Thank you so much for sharing a slice of your world with us.

38:45.534 --> 38:50.577
And if it ever gets hot, you have my permission to jump in the fountain.

38:51.198 --> 38:56.481
If anyone gets angry, just say, no, I have permission from Mococo.

38:56.941 --> 38:58.402
BAU BAU.

39:00.864 --> 39:02.125
Thank you!

39:02.205 --> 39:03.726
BAU BAU!

39:04.786 --> 39:08.729
And next, we have our Question of the Day!

39:08.749 --> 39:10.270
What is it?

39:12.570 --> 39:15.071
Looking at you two play Minecraft made me think.

39:15.651 --> 39:18.412
Would you consider joining one of the construction companies?

39:19.012 --> 39:25.214
I think your senpai in any of them would be delighted to have you join and teach the ropes on how to enjoy building together.

39:25.514 --> 39:26.154
BAU BAU!

39:26.394 --> 39:27.395
Thank you!

39:28.575 --> 39:30.837
I would really love to!

39:30.877 --> 39:34.019
But, you know, we're just beginners at Minecraft.

39:34.079 --> 39:36.021
I don't even think you can say that we're beginners.

39:36.061 --> 39:37.282
We're not even at that step.

39:37.902 --> 39:40.304
I just learned how to move.

39:40.424 --> 39:45.728
But, you know, if our senpai were to take us under their wings, we'd be really happy!

39:45.908 --> 39:47.529
We'd be really happy.

39:47.769 --> 39:49.351
We'd do our best as new members.

39:50.011 --> 39:51.272
They could even bully us.

39:51.292 --> 39:52.233
We won't complain!

39:52.453 --> 39:54.474
But they definitely wouldn't do it like that.

39:54.615 --> 39:56.116
It'd be okay, but...

39:56.896 --> 39:58.617
In case something wants to happen.

39:58.637 --> 40:01.479
Mococo is okay with it, okay?

40:02.340 --> 40:04.782
It's okay if you abuse your power, okay?

40:05.062 --> 40:06.182
Senpai power.

40:06.503 --> 40:07.543
We'll go and fetch stuff.

40:08.104 --> 40:11.846
I don't know how Minecraft works, but we'll go and fetch stuff if you want that, I guess.

40:12.567 --> 40:13.788
Even if it means we die.

40:14.889 --> 40:16.090
No, I don't wanna die.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.813
We'll die!

40:19.173 --> 40:23.258
We'll die for our senpai!

40:23.498 --> 40:26.341
I didn't agree to this.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.684
You know, we're really excited for Minecraft.

40:29.822 --> 40:36.845
And Moco-chan and I really kind of talked about the different parts that we're excited and what we think that we like about Minecraft.

40:36.965 --> 40:38.785
And I think they're both pretty different.

40:39.305 --> 40:43.027
So between the two of us, I think we make a very good team together.

40:43.247 --> 40:50.929
We don't know Minecraft, but we think from what we think we know of Minecraft, which is very little, that we're good.

40:53.550 --> 40:57.552
I think the number one thing is still is that we don't want to be playing alone.

40:59.045 --> 41:03.388
So, we'd really, really like it if a senpai wants to adopt us.

41:04.249 --> 41:05.910
Adopt us senpai!

41:06.590 --> 41:07.931
Adopt us!

41:08.532 --> 41:10.133
BAU BAU!

41:10.173 --> 41:11.234
He'll adopt us, right?

41:13.535 --> 41:14.056
Ruffians!

41:14.736 --> 41:15.437
Actually, no.

41:15.497 --> 41:18.559
We don't want to annoy you senpai.

41:19.339 --> 41:22.622
I would never do that, but it would be nice to be adopted, you know?

41:24.842 --> 41:31.788
Maybe there's a Senpai... Is there like a place where we can go to get adopted in Minecraft and just stay logged in there all the time?

41:31.808 --> 41:33.149
Minecraft Adoption Center!

41:33.349 --> 41:33.570
Yeah!

41:34.721 --> 41:35.541
We'll have to search!

41:35.781 --> 41:37.282
We'll have to search, right?

41:37.462 --> 41:38.302
Google it.

41:39.102 --> 41:40.983
BAU BAU!

41:41.543 --> 41:43.364
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

41:43.544 --> 41:48.205
We're always looking for more submissions for your Pero Sightings, your Doggie of the Day.

41:48.225 --> 41:54.527
We want you to share what kind of walks you're going on, and of course, if you have any questions too!

41:54.587 --> 41:56.868
Thank you for all your submissions, Ruffians!

41:56.908 --> 41:58.808
Thank you for the re-submissions too!

41:58.828 --> 41:59.468
BAU BAU!

42:02.090 --> 42:03.874
Now for our next theme!

42:04.014 --> 42:04.415
Next!

42:05.177 --> 42:07.502
We have... I think some Ruffians know.

42:09.133 --> 42:13.815
I am in Japanese Classroom!

42:14.215 --> 42:14.436
Yes!

42:15.496 --> 42:16.677
Attention please.

42:16.857 --> 42:23.360
Class is in session with Avin, and the lesson is Japanese Language!

42:23.380 --> 42:32.484
We're going to be doing our best to teach Avin all we know about Japanese and test their skills a little bit at the same time.

42:32.504 --> 42:34.325
It'll be a test of ours too.

42:35.265 --> 42:36.726
Are we good teachers?

42:36.987 --> 42:38.988
I'm sure we'll be fine, don't worry Moco-chan.

42:39.289 --> 42:40.250
Don't show weakness!

42:40.770 --> 42:41.551
No weakness!

42:41.711 --> 42:42.752
I'm tough!

42:42.772 --> 42:43.533
I'm strong!

42:44.674 --> 42:48.257
Ruffians, we'd really like it if you could attend the class too.

42:48.877 --> 42:51.640
I think you'll be able to learn a couple new things here and there.

42:52.100 --> 42:58.103
If not, at least it'll be interesting seeing Shiori and Nerissa and Biboo learning.

42:58.503 --> 43:00.985
And FUWAMOCO doing our best to be teachers.

43:01.285 --> 43:03.146
And we'll definitely all have fun.

43:03.926 --> 43:05.867
That's the number one thing.

43:06.027 --> 43:08.188
Fun first, learning second.

43:08.228 --> 43:10.990
We'll do our best, Ruffians!

43:11.070 --> 43:12.591
BAU BAU!

43:13.551 --> 43:15.733
And let's take a peek at our schedule.

43:16.954 --> 43:23.178
Well, on this weekend coming up, we have our first membership stream, our Battle Plan.

43:23.198 --> 43:26.320
But we talked about that.

43:26.360 --> 43:30.563
More interestingly, we have our Rock n' Rawr Party!

43:31.364 --> 43:33.585
It's another FUWAMOCO Rock n' Rawr Party!

43:33.826 --> 43:35.647
It's been a little while, but this time,

43:36.207 --> 43:37.648
Unlike last time, it's archived.

43:38.388 --> 43:43.491
We're archiving it, and the theme is classic anime songs!

43:44.072 --> 43:50.695
We'll be singing a bunch of songs, but maybe not as many as we would like to.

43:51.055 --> 43:57.479
You know, it was really difficult trying to decide because we asked the Doggy Pack if they had any suggestions.

43:57.559 --> 43:59.500
What did you have suggestions?

44:01.441 --> 44:03.902
And there is too many good suggestions!

44:04.782 --> 44:07.763
We wrote them all down, and the list is very very long.

44:07.823 --> 44:10.324
And then from there, we tried to make the list smaller.

44:10.684 --> 44:12.345
And then it was still very very long.

44:12.585 --> 44:16.206
So then we tried again, and it's still too long, we had to go back to it.

44:19.267 --> 44:21.828
We'll put the brakes on a little bit this time.

44:22.208 --> 44:29.371
But we definitely can say that there will be countless anime song themed Rock n' Rawr parties in the future.

44:29.751 --> 44:37.053
There's just too many amazing anime songs that we want to sing, so... We'll pace ourselves.

44:37.473 --> 44:37.833
A bit.

44:38.073 --> 44:39.233
A little bit.

44:39.314 --> 44:44.015
But you know, Rock'n'Roll Party happens every second week, so that means two months.

44:44.495 --> 44:47.976
And there's 12 months in a year, so that's 24 months.

44:50.760 --> 44:58.144
Well, another FUWAMOCO Morning comes to an end, especially the week.

45:06.598 --> 45:06.998
You did it!

45:07.358 --> 45:07.839
We did it!

45:07.919 --> 45:09.659
Y'all did it, Ruffians!

45:10.680 --> 45:12.821
Congratulations!

45:13.161 --> 45:20.445
But before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Viewers today!

45:20.465 --> 45:22.085
Choo-choo!

45:23.886 --> 45:25.027

45:25.228 --> 45:26.369

45:44.107 --> 45:45.528
BAU BAU!

45:45.909 --> 45:51.094
And to every other ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

45:51.474 --> 45:54.437
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

45:54.457 --> 45:56.339
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita!
