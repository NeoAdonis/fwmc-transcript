<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.087
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa.

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:33.612
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.637
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

148!

00:05:56.678 --> 00:06:03.129
We're so close to 150!

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.336
Wow, it sounds like maybe we're a bit noisy for the morning No!

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:08.798
It's got to be noisy!

00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:19.736
Well, it sounds like maybe today might turn out on the right path But maybe there's some more Mouth fans watching and it's your first time today Yeah

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:23.287
Explain a little bit about what FUWAMOCO Morning is.

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:24.729
Because it needs a lot of explanation.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:25.150
It does.

00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:32.122
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday today, Monday!

00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:34.166

Let's go BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:57.624
BAU BAU!

00:06:57.644 --> 00:06:58.085
BAU BAU!

00:06:58.145 --> 00:06:59.547
Japan is tonight on!

00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:01.270
In Japan, it's tonight on.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.353
But right now, it's morning!

00:07:03.994 --> 00:07:05.617
It's morning if you believe it's morning.

00:07:06.038 --> 00:07:09.503
It can always be morning in your heart, I guess.

00:07:09.483 --> 00:07:11.246
BAU BAU!

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:14.170
Let's start off a new day!

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:16.494
Let's make it a good one, okay?

00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:19.298
And on that note, Moco-chan.

00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:24.065
Did we get a submission from a Ruffian?

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:29.433
Maybe that, you know, something was seen somewhere?

00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:33.820
I appreciate Ruffians, but...

00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:35.904
I don't know.

00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:36.885
I like to sing.

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:43.296
Keep the sightings down to a minimum, but I... It's important to know too.

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:45.600
Not Pero again.

00:07:46.762 --> 00:07:47.323
I'm sorry.

00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:50.568
Where was Pero spotted this time?

00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:51.910
Let's take a look.

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:57.111
De-den!

00:07:57.812 --> 00:07:58.653
What is this?

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:02.757
Why do I have a bad feeling running down my spine?

00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:05.699
The Pero turned into a robot!

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.161
A giant one!

00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:11.185
This looks like it's a really big one, like we're looking from the top or something.

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:15.008
The name is... Oh, pero.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:16.990
What does that mean?

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.133
That's frightening.

00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:21.394
Now we have to find out!

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.377
You know, is it here to protect Earth, or...

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:28.520
Bring terror on Aizu?

00:08:31.304 --> 00:08:31.765
Wicked!

00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.429
See, that's what I was thinking, no?

00:08:34.609 --> 00:08:36.912
I think it has to be the terror part!

00:08:38.455 --> 00:08:45.825
Because you know, why would Pero switch from the nastiness he already spreads to, you know, protecting us, right?

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:47.528
We're doomed!

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:48.810
We're doomed!

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:53.417
Don't say that, okay, Ruffians?

00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:54.378
Why not?

00:08:57.415 --> 00:09:00.260
What should we do to stop this?

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:01.803
Get in the Pero.

00:09:02.304 --> 00:09:02.744
No!

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:12.702
Can you imagine the mouth opening, the long tongue rolling out and be like... I was just thinking, if we just get some paint, maybe we can make things better.

00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:13.383
Paint?

00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:15.848
Yeah, just give it a bit of a facelift.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:16.128
What?

00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:16.469
What?

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:16.890
What?

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.833
Just get rid of, you know, the...

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:23.804
I am!

00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:24.846
Hi!

00:09:24.866 --> 00:09:25.867
BAU BAU!

00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:28.452
Morning is nasty!

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:30.415
I think Biboo would.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:33.520
Oh, Biboo would get the Pero.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.803
No, no, no, no, no.

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:35.904
That just sounds wrong.

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:37.467
No, no, no, no, no.

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:40.412
I won't even give her a broken microwave.

00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:42.856
I'm not gonna make her do that, okay?

00:09:43.337 --> 00:09:43.858
It's true.

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.989
Well, I don't know.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:55.124
Maybe, maybe Pero could like fly to the deep depths of the universe and then get lost.

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:55.645
Maybe.

00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:56.607
Right.

00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:59.873
Let's not think about it for now until we get another sighting.

00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:01.703
Sounds good, yeah.

00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:03.186
No panic Moria.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.649
No panic, no good.

00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:06.072
Yes, yes.

00:10:06.092 --> 00:10:08.537
No panic, no good.

00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:10.963
Yes!

00:10:10.983 --> 00:10:12.285
Sounds good Moco-chan, thank you.

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:12.726
Yes!

00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:13.708
You're welcome!

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:20.663
BAU BAU!

00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:22.106
BAU BAU!

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.411
Ruffians!

00:10:24.772 --> 00:10:30.284
I'm not sure if you saw this, but it definitely brought a big smile to our faces!

00:10:30.304 --> 00:10:30.404
Yeah!

00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:32.269
Maybe it'll make your day a bit brighter!

00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:38.442
You know, last year was hololive English's second concert, Breaking Dimension!

00:10:38.462 --> 00:10:38.562
Yeah!

00:10:38.623 --> 00:10:39.765
Breaking Dimension!

00:10:39.745 --> 00:11:09.752
Breaking Dimensions.

00:11:09.732 --> 00:11:17.107
Just the other day in the Philippines at the Las PiÃ±as National High School.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:20.775
It seems like almost the whole school.

00:11:20.815 --> 00:11:24.763
The whole school sung and danced with these inventions.

00:11:25.144 --> 00:11:27.910
It was quite a moving up ceremony.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:37.584
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:54.167
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.330
Everyone's dancing, you know?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.233
Everybody is in sync!

00:11:58.493 --> 00:11:59.134
Right!

00:11:59.374 --> 00:12:01.297
Training and everything!

00:12:01.517 --> 00:12:02.839
Amazing!

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.603
You have to check it out, Ruffians!

00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:07.525
They even know the lyrics!

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:14.175
They know more than just the lyrics!

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:16.678
It really really touched us!

00:12:16.658 --> 00:12:22.363
You know, we talked about it once before, but the lyrics of a song really mean a lot to us.

00:12:22.383 --> 00:12:24.705
They're breaking dimensions very much so.

00:12:25.106 --> 00:12:32.752
So we're really glad that, you know, maybe all those feelings that we hold while singing it, that all the students that they hold them too.

00:12:33.113 --> 00:12:33.333
Yeah.

00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:37.437
I just think about, you know, everybody working together with their friends.

00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:41.500
They're like, oh this part, this part, oh I don't have this part.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:41.640
Right?

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.122
What was it here, like the crayon?

00:12:43.142 --> 00:12:43.402
Oh, the feet.

00:12:43.422 --> 00:12:43.642
Yeah.

00:12:43.903 --> 00:12:46.665
You heard that the principal's song is a jailbreak?

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:50.273
Mr. Principal!

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:53.861
Mr. Principal, you're a Ruffian now too, okay?

00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:57.589
Mr. Principal, I'm gonna say BAU BAU, okay?

00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:00.716
BAU BAU!

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.781
Moco-chan, that was rude!

00:13:03.322 --> 00:13:03.422
Okay!

00:13:03.402 --> 00:13:05.344
3, 2, 1.

00:13:05.544 --> 00:13:07.806
BAU BAU!

00:13:07.826 --> 00:13:09.367
Moco-chan!

00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:12.490
You can't do it like this, okay?

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:18.255
But thank you so much for doing your very special ceremony.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:22.840
And congratulations on reaching for all of your futures.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.461
Every single one of you.

00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:26.583
Please look back on it fondly.

00:13:27.263 --> 00:13:29.886
BAU BAU!

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:33.409
Hey, no silly Moco-chan.

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:42.148
It wasn't a graduation ceremony, it was a moving up ceremony!

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.253
That sounds so cool!

00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:47.520
They weren't tired, they sure did!

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.166
I wonder how much practice they did all day.

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.589
So many questions!

00:13:51.609 --> 00:13:52.111
I wanna know!

00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:54.456
I was thinking, you know, we all released the shorts.

00:13:54.937 --> 00:13:55.077
Right!

00:13:55.097 --> 00:13:57.342
I hope this one on just us dancing it.

00:13:57.543 --> 00:14:01.031
That would be a lot of shorts if they did it for each student.

00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:05.020
I wonder if there's any students that just kept on repeating my video, right?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.581
Oh!

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:05.882
Right!

00:14:05.902 --> 00:14:06.924
I was thinking about that.

00:14:06.944 --> 00:14:07.987
I hope!

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.370
I hope!

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.557
BAU BAU!

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.203
Well, Ruffians, I'm sure you heard about it.

00:14:15.483 --> 00:14:24.844
But just the other day, it was our very beloved Sparkling Rock Biboo's birthday!

00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:26.247
Happy birthday!

00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:27.630
On the 14th.

00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:29.434
She did not turn 14.

00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:40.998
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:54.477
Have a howl of a day!

00:14:55.148 --> 00:15:12.465
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

00:15:12.817 --> 00:15:23.212
But you know, in true FIWU fashion, nothing gets her down, okay?

00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:31.625
So instead for her birthday, she shared some very cute new outfits on the VR chat together with the pebbles.

00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:35.430
But it seems like things got very silly.

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.033
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:38.014
Not surprised at all.

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:45.626
But you know, Biboo, she's been having a lot of fun together with Shiori on VRChat recently.

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:49.790
I hope that we can join that sometime too!

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.871
VRChat amazing.

00:15:51.432 --> 00:15:53.294
That'd be fun, huh?

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.281
Oh, we're gonna teach this VRChat too, okay?

00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:02.564
But you know, we can't wait until Biboo's big bash.

00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:04.266
Only a little bit longer.

00:16:04.326 --> 00:16:06.188
Biboo's big birthday bash.

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:06.769
I did it.

00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:11.791
beloved people's big birthday bash.

00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:19.063
That was better.

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:19.243
BAU BAU.

00:16:19.294 --> 00:16:21.763
A little Mason?

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:22.224
Yes!

00:16:24.813 --> 00:16:24.893
Hi!

00:16:24.913 --> 00:16:25.114
I love it!

00:16:25.134 --> 00:16:26.358
We must make birthday pass, Popo!

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:29.610
Yes!

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:32.620
Wow!

00:16:33.182 --> 00:16:34.687
Ruffians!

00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:34.748
BAU B

00:16:37.107 --> 00:16:42.813
I'm sure that you're all extremely surprised, shocked, and excited by the news.

00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:55.847
But, our senpai from hololive English Midgar Club, she announced that she'll be graduating on May 1st.

00:16:56.989 --> 00:16:58.991
She just announced it yesterday night.

00:17:00.492 --> 00:17:02.895
Yeah, I'm sure you heard the news, but...

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:06.774
You know, it's very hard to say goodbye.

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:10.099
She's been such an influential talent.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.185
You know, member of hololive more than anything and Vtuber too.

00:17:14.586 --> 00:17:24.040
And you know, we know it was probably a very hard decision, but we wish her all the best and hope for her happiness.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:30.575
As we're sure you can imagine, there are a lot of things that we still wanted to do with Gura-senpai, you know?

00:17:30.956 --> 00:17:40.057
We want to sing together, dance together, play games together, and even just chat more.

00:17:40.077 --> 00:17:40.658
We're really sad to be apart.

00:17:40.678 --> 00:17:40.999
And you know?

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:49.895
We know that there's been a lot of sad announcements and departures recently, and it's hard to have to say goodbye to those who mean so much to you, you know?

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:58.952
So, Ruffians, we want you to know it's okay to be sad, to grieve, and maybe even feel a little bit upset too.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.216
But just know that we're here!

00:18:01.737 --> 00:18:05.383
And while we know our experiences are very different from others,

00:18:05.954 --> 00:18:08.718
Goodbye, rough times here and there too for us.

00:18:08.998 --> 00:18:12.063
We're still very happy to be here at hololive English.

00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:17.511
And we know there isn't too much time left before we have to say goodbye.

00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:21.777
But we hope that we can have a lot of fun time together with you and Senpai too!

00:18:22.698 --> 00:18:29.648
And you know, we want to say a big thank you to her for all the amazing moments and the memories that we've had.

00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:33.193
All thanks to our very well-loved Senpai.

00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:36.701
BAU BAU!

00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.066
You look so cute!

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:41.248
Thank you Gura!

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:44.853
Thank you Gura-senpai!

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:48.679
So you know, just know that it's okay to feel those feelings, okay?

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.682
We understand.

00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:55.569
BAU BAU!

00:18:58.894 --> 00:19:00.717
We saw you know!

00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:05.942
There's another senpai that has some exciting news.

00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:07.743
Exciting!

00:19:07.764 --> 00:19:10.826
Luna-senpai from hololive Indonesia IG!

00:19:11.327 --> 00:19:13.268
She's released an album!

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:13.789
Yes!

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.831
Pandora!

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:17.312
Yes!

00:19:17.913 --> 00:19:18.493
And did you hear?

00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:21.096
It's not just an album.

00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:22.056
It also has physical copies!

00:19:22.076 --> 00:19:22.337
Yes!

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:28.582
So you know, that means, you know, instead of just being like, oh, I can listen to lots of YouTube or Spotify or whatever.

00:19:28.642 --> 00:19:30.484
Of course you can do that.

00:19:30.464 --> 00:19:31.957
It means you can put your paws on it!

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.399
You can hold the CD!

00:19:35.105 --> 00:19:36.827
Oh no, senpai.

00:19:37.168 --> 00:19:38.910
This is her voice on this disc.

00:19:39.731 --> 00:19:42.155
On her new album, it has 10 songs.

00:19:42.575 --> 00:19:43.777
And, uh, it's important.

00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:44.778
This is an important part.

00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.302
So, uh, pre-orders closed.

00:19:48.343 --> 00:19:49.805

00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:52.529
April 17th at 6pm JST.

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:53.290
Very, very soon.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.091
Very soon.

00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:54.932
In a few hours.

00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:57.395
The only time that you can get your paws on the maze.

00:19:57.415 --> 00:19:57.495
Yes.

00:19:57.936 --> 00:19:58.336
Maze.

00:19:58.356 --> 00:20:00.119
Because the physical release.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.462
Now, this is important.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.408
It's completely made to order!

00:20:06.428 --> 00:20:10.776
So if you want one, then you need to pre-order it.

00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:14.142
There's a bunch of bonuses too!

00:20:14.162 --> 00:20:20.974
Like a handwritten autograph, and even an online meet-and-greet application ticket!

00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:26.745
Did you hear about the online meet-and-greet application ticket?

00:20:26.945 --> 00:20:29.408
Moona, Moona wrote on this.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:33.875
You can also chat with her and be like, I have this and you know your hands touch this.

00:20:33.895 --> 00:20:36.278
Online meet and greet!

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:38.581
Online meet and greet!

00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.204
Moona-senpai is doing online meet and greet!

00:20:40.224 --> 00:20:40.724
What?

00:20:41.385 --> 00:20:42.447
Right?

00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:43.148
Right.

00:20:43.168 --> 00:20:53.442
But you know, also, just recently Moona-senpai released a new song called 100% and it's feat a certain Nerissa Waveron.

00:20:53.422 --> 00:21:04.343
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:21:05.521 --> 00:21:08.665
I really really liked it!

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.629
I'm sure there's lots of other songs on the album too!

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:15.453
So please check them out!

00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:21.621
It's your chance, your chance to get your paws on all the samples' music!

00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.284
Nerissa Ravencroft, I know, right?

00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:28.710
It's that Nerissa Ravencroft with the... Mona.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.972
Amazing.

00:21:29.992 --> 00:21:30.232
BAU BAU!

00:21:30.593 --> 00:21:36.902
So please check it out if you're interested, okay?

00:21:36.922 --> 00:21:37.022
When?

00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:37.262
When?

00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:41.408
You can check it out on the official hololive shop.

00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:42.670
And the meet and greet is online.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.391
That's all I know.

00:21:43.411 --> 00:21:43.931
Where online?

00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:44.712
I don't know.

00:21:44.732 --> 00:21:45.654
That's just amazing.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:47.076
So fun!

00:21:47.096 --> 00:21:49.980
BAU BAU!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.542
I really don't want to go online meet and greet.

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:54.208
Yeah... Oh, you're not a bit envious?

00:21:54.509 --> 00:22:04.939
No... No... Wow... What a weird... Uh... I got in trouble... Not by like Mane-chan!

00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:05.960
Not by Moco-chan!

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.681
That happens all the time!

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:10.284
Huh?

00:22:10.304 --> 00:22:16.790
Um... I had a warning... Oh!

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.611
I had a warning with...

00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:31.086
You know, FUWAMOCO, we've been going for walks.

00:22:31.106 --> 00:22:33.169
Recently, you know, the weather's been nice.

00:22:33.189 --> 00:22:33.890
What did you do?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.893
So, we went for a walk.

00:22:36.073 --> 00:22:36.874
You know.

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:39.338
And we're enjoying it.

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:41.961
And you know, we're just walking by and we're like, oh look!

00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:44.885
There's a police officer over there!

00:22:44.945 --> 00:22:45.486
You know.

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.128
Okay.

00:22:47.108 --> 00:22:48.510
Well-protected streets.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.972
Good, good, good.

00:22:50.032 --> 00:22:54.840
And then there was one person that zoomed by on their bike and I was like, well that's quite an okay movement.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.305
And then the police officer was like, Get off the bike!

00:22:58.325 --> 00:22:59.006
Get off the bike!

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:01.429
In the nicest way possible, because that's dangerous!

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.072
Yeah, and I was like, yes.

00:23:03.092 --> 00:23:05.876
We're like, yes, dangerous, thank you, good job.

00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:07.058
That's what I thought too.

00:23:07.078 --> 00:23:11.404
And then so we just keep on walking by like, good job, good job.

00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:15.951
And then, couple meters down the lane, I hear

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:18.575
Close your phone!

00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:22.021
Don't look at your phone and walk there miss!

00:23:24.045 --> 00:23:26.629
Is that me?

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.713
I kind of had my phone open.

00:23:28.733 --> 00:23:30.877
I wasn't looking at the phone screen!

00:23:31.378 --> 00:23:32.079
I wasn't!

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:32.580
Okay!

00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:34.404
But it was just open.

00:23:34.824 --> 00:23:36.728
I was looking straight where I was walking.

00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:38.671
Yeah.

00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:39.593
I can understand.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.453
Mococo wasn't in trouble.

00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:43.876
I was framed, okay?

00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:46.099
It wasn't me!

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.301
You were framed!

00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:48.864
Who framed you, huh?

00:23:49.084 --> 00:23:51.989
I just... I don't want to go back to the cell, you know?

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.251
Okay?

00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:55.574
She doesn't want to go back in the cell.

00:23:55.855 --> 00:23:57.157
I wasn't this time!

00:23:57.177 --> 00:23:57.357
I did.

00:23:57.497 --> 00:23:59.100
I was walking.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.701
Yes.

00:24:00.682 --> 00:24:02.404
It's not good to be on your phone.

00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:04.347
It was just open.

00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:05.868
It was just open.

00:24:05.889 --> 00:24:08.312
I was looking at it.

00:24:09.153 --> 00:24:10.835
I was looking at the phone.

00:24:11.536 --> 00:24:11.936
Really?

00:24:13.138 --> 00:24:16.402
That was close call.

00:24:16.902 --> 00:24:17.663
I'm Muzai.

00:24:17.683 --> 00:24:18.504
I'm innocent.

00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:19.746
Muzai!

00:24:20.747 --> 00:24:22.629
Muzai!

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:24.952
Fuwawa!

00:24:25.373 --> 00:24:25.493
Muzai!

00:24:25.473 --> 00:24:30.440
Ruffians, I'm innocent, right?

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.421
You agree with me, right?

00:24:31.441 --> 00:24:31.561
Right?

00:24:32.342 --> 00:24:33.003
I'm innocent?

00:24:33.023 --> 00:24:36.068
You're not going to send me back to the cell, right, Ruffians?

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.695
Even if she is potentially a... What's the word?

00:24:43.237 --> 00:24:46.262
Potentially... What?

00:24:46.282 --> 00:24:51.228
Committed a crime looking at her phone while walking.

00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:53.071
She sent me back to the cell!

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:53.792
You'll never catch me.

00:24:54.245 --> 00:24:55.947
BAU BAU!

00:24:55.987 --> 00:24:56.327
BAU BAU!

00:24:56.347 --> 00:25:16.911
BAU BAU!

00:25:18.342 --> 00:25:20.246
BAU BAU!

00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:21.449
You should tell justice!

00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:22.731
Please don't tell justice!

00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:25.056
No justice needs to be elated!

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:28.183
It's okay!

00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:31.390
BAU BAU!

00:25:33.614 --> 00:25:35.618
Do you have something else to tell the Ruffians?

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:42.091
Ruffians, um, you have another secret?

00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:51.651
I have a secret that I just decided not to tell you about for months.

00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:52.753
It's kind of embarrassing, Moco-chan.

00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:57.201
You know how, you know, you eat food.

00:25:57.922 --> 00:26:02.370
When you have food, like a breakfast, or lunch, or dinner.

00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:11.785
And then sometimes, um, there's some people that like to, you know, uh, maybe like try and be efficient.

00:26:12.246 --> 00:26:16.092
And then like, uh, cook their food in the shower.

00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:36.814
Like we're... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:26:37.773 --> 00:26:40.056
I might be kinda like that, Ruffians.

00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:44.341
I don't- I don't rinse the fruits and the vegetables in the shower, okay?

00:26:44.982 --> 00:26:49.127
But I do like to sleep in the bed.

00:26:50.649 --> 00:26:50.969
With fruits.

00:26:53.853 --> 00:26:54.534
With fruits.

00:26:56.476 --> 00:26:57.457
At your door.

00:26:58.098 --> 00:26:59.740
I have my banana, right?

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.544
Then I sleep in the bed with the banana pillow, right?

00:27:03.465 --> 00:27:06.008
But recently, as in a while ago.

00:27:06.983 --> 00:27:10.029
No!

00:27:10.189 --> 00:27:14.377
I sleep in the bed with a banana and a tuna!

00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:18.605
Yeah!

00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:21.570
I sandwich between a banana and a tuna.

00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:24.656
Basically that's FUWAMOCO's life.

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:25.197
Banana.

00:27:25.698 --> 00:27:26.199
Tuna.

00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:27.962
Fuwawa.

00:27:27.942 --> 00:27:34.014
Yeah, you know, we're out having some fun with Biboo!

00:27:34.034 --> 00:27:38.644
And you know, there was an arcade, so like, let's go with them!

00:27:38.664 --> 00:27:44.736
And they have like, one machine where you know, there's like a plushie, a big plushie!

00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:48.263
And it's stuck to a string, and you have to cut that string.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.378
Well, there was a tuna on that line and I was like, okay, I'm just gonna do it.

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:54.063
What's in the mood for fishing?

00:27:54.103 --> 00:27:57.431
Free twice, Ruffians!

00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:58.153
I got it!

00:27:58.173 --> 00:28:00.960
It's free twice!

00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:03.046
Yeah.

00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:03.126
No!

00:28:03.146 --> 00:28:04.891
I don't want to take free twice!

00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:05.492
Free twice!

00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:09.007
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:09.027 --> 00:28:10.588
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:10.608 --> 00:28:11.329
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:11.349 --> 00:28:13.211
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:13.612 --> 00:28:15.654
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:17.395
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:18.356
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:19.858
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:19.878 --> 00:28:20.739
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:23.202
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:23.222 --> 00:28:24.263
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:24.283 --> 00:28:25.224
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:25.324 --> 00:28:26.105
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:27.967
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:28.107 --> 00:28:29.909
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:29.929 --> 00:28:30.830
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.032
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:33.052 --> 00:28:33.773
Mokoko, give me 5,000 Yen!

00:28:33.793 --> 00:28:35.054
Mokoko, give me 5,

00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:36.640
Yeah.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:36.880
No.

00:28:37.402 --> 00:28:37.823
Yeah.

00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:39.850
It was fast, but it wasn't that much fast.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:46.009
So now, I guess officially, I like to sleep in bed with foot.

00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:50.324
It's comfy!

00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:52.729
I get a good sleep with my tuna and my banana.

00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:54.312
I don't have anything.

00:28:54.973 --> 00:28:55.675
Banana.

00:28:56.056 --> 00:28:56.577
Tuna.

00:28:57.919 --> 00:28:58.060
Fuwawa!

00:28:58.641 --> 00:29:02.789
BAU BAU!

00:29:03.631 --> 00:29:03.791
BAU BAU!

00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:05.635
There's not too much space left.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.302
Meow.

00:29:07.322 --> 00:29:08.244
I'll find a little one.

00:29:08.264 --> 00:29:08.965
I have space.

00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:12.412
I think I could use something else in my bed too.

00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:14.195
Huh?

00:29:14.215 --> 00:29:15.577
I could use something else in my bed.

00:29:15.658 --> 00:29:16.439
Like what, Moco-chan?

00:29:17.681 --> 00:29:18.964
Something.

00:29:18.984 --> 00:29:19.204
Comfy.

00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:23.592
Tuk-tuk.

00:29:23.612 --> 00:29:24.093
That's all.

00:29:24.874 --> 00:29:26.357
Are you waiting for it to ship, maybe?

00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:26.437
No?

00:29:26.918 --> 00:29:27.700
No?

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:27.960
Oh.

00:29:30.353 --> 00:29:39.123
FUWAMOCO-chan, I'm feeling a little sad now because I was excited, but maybe you have something that can make me feel a little better?

00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:41.806
Like, don't get a dare!

00:29:42.127 --> 00:29:52.158
That makes me feel better, but not quite like that.

00:29:52.178 --> 00:29:52.459
Ruffians.

00:29:55.742 --> 00:29:56.623
Do you need a pup talk?

00:29:58.365 --> 00:29:58.926
You need a pup talk?

00:30:02.517 --> 00:30:03.118
Please?

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:04.982
It's okay.

00:30:05.002 --> 00:30:07.707
You don't need to say pretty please.

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:11.875
Please is always good.

00:30:14.781 --> 00:30:15.743
Okay?

00:30:15.763 --> 00:30:15.943
Ruffians!

00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:20.492
It's that time again!

00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:23.301
It's that time again!

00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:28.249
It's time for another well-needed FUWAMOCO Pup Talk!

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:35.881
And you're going to hear it straight from me, FUWAMOCO!

00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:38.344
Ruffians!

00:30:38.364 --> 00:30:39.026
Adventrix!

00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:39.927
hololive fans!

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:43.392
Has it been a bit difficult recently?

00:30:44.674 --> 00:30:46.497
I...want me to yell it.

00:30:53.378 --> 00:30:54.640
Even feeling sad?

00:30:57.284 --> 00:30:59.307
Even a bit despaired?

00:30:59.848 --> 00:31:00.630
A bit lost?

00:31:04.215 --> 00:31:07.300
I understand how you might be feeling right now, okay?

00:31:09.143 --> 00:31:09.864
Fuwawa does too!

00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:12.468
Please remember, okay?

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.712
It's okay to feel sad.

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:23.742
It's important to express those emotions, to talk to those around you, to those who care about you and will lend you their shoulder.

00:31:25.805 --> 00:31:37.204
We know that it can be exhausting to feel such strong emotions and that it's hard to continue as you did and sometimes you feel like it might not be worth it for you to care about things like you did before.

00:31:38.707 --> 00:31:42.032
And it's okay to take a break, to take a breather.

00:31:43.025 --> 00:31:46.169
Please know that we'll always be here waiting for you.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.354
And there will be more exciting, fun, and silly times ahead!

00:31:51.916 --> 00:31:54.780
But we'll keep doing our best until we can see you again, okay?

00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:58.304
We're here to protect your smile forever and ever!

00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:10.159
And even though we know that it's pretty rough right now, that maybe your smile might be weakened, we hope that you know that we're here by your side, okay?

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.762
That we'll get through this together!

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:21.589
And, you know, our journey, it will always be smooth sailing, but even with its bumps, it's worth overcoming and growing together.

00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:26.096
So, let's continue to do the best we can right now, Ruffians!

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:34.749
Whether that be being kind to yourself and giving yourself a lot of extra care, or continuing on without thinking too deeply into everything.

00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:36.411
Okay?

00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.397
Make sure to remember those around you too, who might be having a hard time.

00:32:40.938 --> 00:32:42.360
And most of all,

00:32:42.678 --> 00:32:45.044
You know, love those who mean a lot to you.

00:32:45.204 --> 00:32:45.826
Lots and lots.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:46.507
Okay?

00:32:47.469 --> 00:32:50.657
Let's do our best to get through this!

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:51.740
Ganbatte de!

00:32:52.983 --> 00:32:53.143
BAU BAU!

00:32:53.562 --> 00:33:05.278
Let's take a look at today's Doggie of the Day.

00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:09.844
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:33:09.864 --> 00:33:10.725
It's Kona!

00:33:10.806 --> 00:33:18.396
And BAU BAU!

00:33:18.656 --> 00:33:19.437
Cute!

00:33:19.477 --> 00:33:19.958
With ears!

00:33:20.782 --> 00:33:21.665
Look!

00:33:21.986 --> 00:33:23.170
Look at this!

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.678
I go fluff on the nose there!

00:33:25.698 --> 00:33:29.610
Wait, I go straight to the fluff nose!

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.731
Koda!

00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:29.851
Koda!

00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:31.215
Do you not see it?

00:33:31.336 --> 00:33:33.041
It's so silly!

00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:33.643
Hi!

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.511
I know.

00:33:34.531 --> 00:33:40.078
I feel like Kona's eyes, you can see just how wise she is.

00:33:40.098 --> 00:33:40.258
Right?

00:33:40.278 --> 00:33:41.580
So beautiful.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.808
She looks like she can protect you well no matter how old or young she might be.

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:49.450
Yes!

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.412
So cute.

00:33:50.692 --> 00:33:52.034
Very playful young.

00:33:52.054 --> 00:33:52.915
Beautiful dog.

00:33:53.315 --> 00:33:54.517
Distinguished lady.

00:33:55.078 --> 00:33:57.581
That's what I was thinking too.

00:33:58.382 --> 00:34:00.685
How did Kona BAU BAU Moco-chan?

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.247
I think...

00:34:03.304 --> 00:34:07.149
Baobab!

00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:10.935
Baobab!

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.418
Baobab!

00:34:14.259 --> 00:34:16.763
Baobab!

00:34:16.783 --> 00:34:19.366
Baobab!

00:34:19.527 --> 00:34:20.268
Baobab!

00:34:20.788 --> 00:34:21.069
Baobab!

00:34:21.089 --> 00:34:21.229
Baobab!

00:34:22.072 --> 00:34:24.254
Well, you know, we can tell.

00:34:24.275 --> 00:34:25.496
I can see it in those eyes.

00:34:26.017 --> 00:34:28.399
FUWANA is a very well-loved doggy.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.803
And she's been adored for many years.

00:34:32.123 --> 00:34:36.989
We're just glad that you make sure to cuddle her lots and lots.

00:34:37.009 --> 00:34:37.570
Extra lots.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.474
Give her scratches whenever you're able to visit her.

00:34:41.494 --> 00:34:43.557
You know, there's a lot going on sometimes.

00:34:43.637 --> 00:34:46.480
Maybe you can't see her as much as you want to.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.965
But you know, it makes those times even more special the more love and

00:34:50.945 --> 00:35:10.843
FUWAMOCO We got out on a walk.

00:35:11.414 --> 00:35:13.377
Well, let's take a look at what you went on.

00:35:13.397 --> 00:35:15.120
Today I went on a walk.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.567
We have... De-den!

00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:21.169
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:35:21.189 --> 00:35:21.289
Yeah!

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:21.890
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:22.010
Yeah!

00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:24.709
Yeah, you see it!

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:25.660
The kongoyebi!

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.308
The sun going through the leaves, and they're going...

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.360
FUWAM

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:33.689
Wow, this is such a beautiful scene from Meiji Shrine.

00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:34.470
Very famous.

00:35:35.371 --> 00:35:41.000
But you know, I'm so happy to hear that you've been enjoying Japan together with your family.

00:35:41.621 --> 00:35:43.364
Hopefully you saw some sakura.

00:35:43.384 --> 00:35:45.467
Oh maybe, right.

00:35:46.168 --> 00:35:49.394
But I hope that you're able to draw a good omikuji.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:50.555
Yeah, good fortune.

00:35:50.876 --> 00:35:52.238
If not...

00:35:53.045 --> 00:35:55.348
Your luck starts now!

00:35:57.932 --> 00:35:58.093
BAU BAU!

00:35:58.173 --> 00:36:03.921
Thank you for sharing a picture of your trip with us!

00:36:03.941 --> 00:36:07.326
And let's see how our Question of the Day is!

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:11.172
Hello FUWAMOCO!

00:36:11.152 --> 00:36:19.269
I wanted to ask what anime you like.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.598
I have nothing to watch and I wanted to ask what anime you recommend.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.047
BAU BAU!

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.072
Abyss, do you know what I'm going to recommend?

00:36:31.092 --> 00:36:31.333
Do you?

00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:34.436
Do you know what I'm going to recommend?

00:36:34.456 --> 00:36:35.678
I have a feeling!

00:36:35.698 --> 00:36:36.078
School days!

00:36:36.098 --> 00:36:36.379
Yes.

00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:40.143
You know, I recommend school days for a different feeling.

00:36:40.223 --> 00:36:44.048
I'm not sure if that's the feeling you want to feel right now, but it's definitely a different feeling.

00:36:44.348 --> 00:36:47.492
Maybe you'll feel feelings after you watch it.

00:36:47.532 --> 00:36:50.215
Maybe it's a way to feel.

00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:50.615
Can I raise a fang?

00:36:50.635 --> 00:36:50.976
Something!

00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:54.540
FUWAMOCO-chan, what are you going to recommend?

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.185
Odd Taxi is a good recommendation.

00:36:57.265 --> 00:36:58.928
It's a good middle ground.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.393
Go into it without anything.

00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:05.098
Just being like, Odd Taxi, that's something.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.242
Going with the open mind.

00:37:07.722 --> 00:37:10.147
School days too, going with the open mind.

00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:13.192
But they're both very different.

00:37:13.212 --> 00:37:16.758
Is there any similarities between Odd Taxi and school days?

00:37:16.778 --> 00:37:18.621
Modes of transportation.

00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:21.717
Train and a taxi?

00:37:21.737 --> 00:37:22.539
No, boat.

00:37:23.021 --> 00:37:23.201
Taxi.

00:37:23.643 --> 00:37:25.669
Oh, I guess it's also a pretty nice boat.

00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:28.318
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

00:37:28.338 --> 00:37:28.859
Okay.

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.866
Modes of transportation.

00:37:30.886 --> 00:37:31.448
Road map.

00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:33.775
But the art has helped us.

00:37:38.463 --> 00:37:40.846
Please check them out!

00:37:41.527 --> 00:37:43.389
BAU BAU!

00:37:43.769 --> 00:37:47.935
Thank you so much to our Ruffians for all the submissions today!

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:49.777
You know what?

00:37:49.797 --> 00:37:52.981
FUWAMOCO Morning shall be made together with you, Ruffians!

00:37:53.241 --> 00:37:56.445
Thank you for always being here in the mornings together with us.

00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:57.726
And you know what?

00:37:57.746 --> 00:38:00.690
If you happen to see Pero, even if FUWAMOCO might complain,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.013
Please let us know.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:06.882
If you see any cute doggies and you're like, oh this is my Doggie of the Day, I'm gonna share it with FUWAMOCO.

00:38:07.142 --> 00:38:10.890
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.116
We're also looking for more of your vlogs, more of your questions.

00:38:14.176 --> 00:38:15.759
I'm sure you have questions.

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:17.502
Please ask us with the hashtag.

00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.506
BAU BAU!

00:38:19.486 --> 00:38:21.248
For our next stream!

00:38:21.889 --> 00:38:27.636
We have another stream coming up pretty soon here.

00:38:27.656 --> 00:38:30.600
We're gonna be continuing Donkey Kong Country 2.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.723
We've been playing it on the SNES.

00:38:33.183 --> 00:38:34.365
Retro gaming.

00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:36.347
Things are pretty crazy.

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:40.212
In case you are not familiar with our Donkey Kong streams.

00:38:41.035 --> 00:38:43.419
We scream more than horror games.

00:38:43.439 --> 00:38:46.424
You know Moco-chan plays, and I play.

00:38:46.664 --> 00:38:47.726
I'm Dixie.

00:38:47.746 --> 00:38:48.928
I'm Diddy.

00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:50.771
A lot of things happen.

00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:52.293
A lot of trouble is had.

00:38:52.734 --> 00:38:53.976
Some swamming happens.

00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:55.899
Controller goes through some abuse.

00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:58.924
We might have almost got bled on the controller last time.

00:38:59.725 --> 00:39:03.972
So who knows what's gonna happen this time, huh?

00:39:03.952 --> 00:39:06.556
BAU BAU!

00:39:06.576 --> 00:39:07.838
And for our schedule!

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:18.995
Our upcoming schedule like we shared earlier, Biboo's birthday is gonna be on Thursday at 6pm PT so we hope to see you there so we can all celebrate Biboo's birthday together!

00:39:19.015 --> 00:39:23.382
And on Friday we'll be back with another episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:32.676
Before we head off on our first mini vacation since our debut, we're gonna go around Japan, explore a little bit, you know,

00:39:32.656 --> 00:39:50.682
We're gonna have a refreshing time, that's for sure.

00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:53.045
