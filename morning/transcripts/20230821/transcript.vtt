05:02.135 --> 05:04.585 
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:04.760 --> 05:08.100
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:08.200 --> 05:11.750
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:14.775 --> 05:17.475
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:17.525 --> 05:19.770
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:19.865 --> 05:22.440 
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:24.655 --> 05:29.205
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:29.825 --> 05:32.789
Today, it's our 9th episode!

05:32.809 --> 05:35.252
Thank you for joining us!

05:35.392 --> 05:37.475

For those who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

05:49.231 --> 05:49.811

05:50.772 --> 05:54.053

Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start off your day on the right paw.

05:59.736 --> 06:03.977
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING.

06:04.177 --> 06:04.518
Okay?

06:04.858 --> 06:05.098
Okay?

06:05.758 --> 06:09.543
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:09.723 --> 06:11.926
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

06:12.987 --> 06:14.929
Ruffians, guess what?

06:15.670 --> 06:16.331
Guess what?

06:17.112 --> 06:21.417
There's been another Pero Sighting!

06:23.370 --> 06:24.792
Where is he now?

06:25.113 --> 06:25.914
Where is he now?

06:25.934 --> 06:33.747
It seems like a ruffian is re-appointed seeing him in...

06:38.069 --> 06:38.809
Blueberry Farm?

06:38.889 --> 06:39.950
Blueberry Farm?

06:41.670 --> 06:46.132
I guess it seems like Pero wanted to get a taste of nature's day from the forest.

06:46.172 --> 06:46.552
Right.

06:47.492 --> 06:48.392
I would like to too.

06:48.432 --> 06:49.973
Yeah, I'm a bit jealous to be honest.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.833
Why didn't he invite us?

06:51.853 --> 06:53.734
I want to eat fresh berries too!

06:54.014 --> 06:54.934
Not very fair.

06:55.134 --> 06:57.255
I guess Pero must like blueberries the best.

06:57.295 --> 06:58.375
They are really yummy.

06:58.695 --> 06:59.896
Moco-chan, what's your favorite?

07:01.621 --> 07:06.204
Blueberries are good, but I think I like the blueberries that are sort of green.

07:06.585 --> 07:07.966
But I had to choose.

07:08.526 --> 07:10.708
It just makes sense, you know, the green blueberries.

07:10.748 --> 07:11.949
The green berries.

07:13.330 --> 07:16.492
But my favorite type of berries are raspberries.

07:16.512 --> 07:16.953
Raspberries.

07:16.993 --> 07:17.833
Raspberries.

07:18.374 --> 07:19.955
Raspberries?

07:19.975 --> 07:20.655
They're good.

07:21.896 --> 07:23.357
But blueberries are good.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.279
Strawberries are good.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.601
I like the blueberries and the strawberries.

07:27.761 --> 07:29.222
They're good too.

07:30.239 --> 07:31.720
Ruffians, what about you?

07:32.260 --> 07:33.421
Yeah, the unraped ones.

07:33.441 --> 07:34.121
The yellow berries.

07:34.181 --> 07:34.942
The green ones.

07:37.703 --> 07:38.964
But berries are really yummy.

07:39.905 --> 07:40.865
I'm sorry about Pero.

07:40.885 --> 07:43.867
That's not very nice of him to just help himself to it though.

07:44.027 --> 07:46.749
You know, these ruffians, they work hard to grow them.

07:47.029 --> 07:48.229
Harvest them.

07:48.289 --> 07:50.251
Now Pero's just eating them all up.

07:51.291 --> 07:51.651
Sorry.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.954
If we don't stop him, he's gonna turn blue or something, right?

07:56.154 --> 07:58.235
He'll just turn into a big blueberry himself.

08:00.462 --> 08:02.462
Kinda delicious if I imagine him like that.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.087
But it's a good thing that he stopped after taking our lunch.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.187
I'm sorry that he took your lunch, though.

08:10.787 --> 08:11.928
You can just eat him next.

08:11.948 --> 08:12.888
It'll be okay.

08:13.008 --> 08:13.828
Revenge!

08:14.288 --> 08:17.469
But as soon as we find him, we'll teach him some manners, okay?

08:18.209 --> 08:21.530
Ruffians, please let us know if you have any more Pero Sightings, okay?

08:22.190 --> 08:25.750
Remember to use hashtag FWMCMORNING, okay?

08:26.851 --> 08:30.511
Hopefully though, Pero... He'll be back at the backrooms, right?

08:30.652 --> 08:32.352
We're gonna go looking for him, so...

08:33.328 --> 08:34.248
He better be there.

08:34.429 --> 08:36.610
He's just going for a snack maybe.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.510
It's his lunch break, right?

08:40.231 --> 08:41.572
BAU BAU!

08:45.233 --> 08:48.935
This is something really important now, Ruffians, okay?

08:48.955 --> 08:52.317
You need to listen up.

08:53.257 --> 08:56.859
It's really important, so you're gonna listen closely, okay?

09:00.028 --> 09:02.950
We haven't really had anything like this before.

09:02.990 --> 09:08.214
And we're really sad and disappointed that it's come to this day.

09:08.474 --> 09:11.056
But it's really important that this is said.

09:11.076 --> 09:16.119
So we really wanted to take some time to speak to you heart to heart.

09:16.259 --> 09:18.100
Not a misunderstanding.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.303
Especially you, Fuwawa.

09:22.323 --> 09:23.784
Go ahead.

09:28.246 --> 09:34.779
Ruffians, I, Fuwawa Abyssgard, have an apology to make to you.

09:36.863 --> 09:41.488
I apologize for my uncalled fit of anger.

09:42.769 --> 09:45.632
You know, yesterday doing Donkey Kong Country.

09:46.153 --> 09:51.238
You know, we're having lots of fun trying to get to the Minecraft Carnage level.

09:51.679 --> 09:59.066
And you know, even after we're talking about how we're enjoying it and that we're feeling no pain and you know, it's like playing a game with a friend.

10:00.979 --> 10:01.881
Yeah, you did.

10:02.101 --> 10:08.191
But, but, but, I only snapped because it had set me up to die after Mococo-chan had died, you know?

10:08.211 --> 10:08.912
As an excuse.

10:08.972 --> 10:10.494
It was the furthest we had reached!

10:10.554 --> 10:11.756
You understand, right?

10:12.297 --> 10:12.578
Right?

10:14.744 --> 10:15.505
I apologize.

10:15.645 --> 10:16.986
Is that really an apology?

10:17.066 --> 10:29.697
I apologize for calling Donkey Kong Country stupid even after it has provided us and countless ruffians many hours of fun and entertainment and precious memories.

10:30.017 --> 10:32.339
Even though we're only 15% through the game.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.080
Countless hours.

10:35.061 --> 10:36.002
I'm sorry Donkey.

10:36.022 --> 10:37.824
I'm sorry Diddy.

10:38.164 --> 10:39.065
And most importantly...

10:39.805 --> 10:40.946
I'm sorry, Candy.

10:41.086 --> 10:42.968
Excuse me, I don't think that's good enough.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.870
You didn't call them by their last name.

10:45.110 --> 10:45.650
Donkey Kong!

10:45.670 --> 10:47.272
Diddy Kong!

10:47.732 --> 10:48.393
Candy Kong.

10:48.493 --> 10:49.474
Is she part of the family?

10:49.494 --> 10:51.896
She hopes to see.

10:51.916 --> 10:52.837
She's a part of the family.

10:52.877 --> 10:55.999
Candy, please let us see you more often next time, okay?

10:56.019 --> 10:58.382
This is my apology.

10:58.862 --> 11:00.684
From my heart to yours.

11:01.104 --> 11:01.925
Do you accept it?

11:01.945 --> 11:03.006
Ruffians.

11:03.446 --> 11:05.067
Was that heartfelt enough?

11:07.295 --> 11:07.915
Dogeza?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.218
I'm a dog, but I don't need to dogeza.

11:12.819 --> 11:14.300
No, it doesn't fit the crime.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.601
It doesn't fit the crime.

11:17.582 --> 11:18.863
If you can tell, I'm innocent.

11:18.883 --> 11:20.424
I just happened to be in the photo.

11:20.784 --> 11:23.926
You died, so... I don't know about that.

11:23.986 --> 11:24.827
You played a part.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.328
Was it heartfelt enough?

11:26.788 --> 11:28.529
It's good she's atoned for the crimes.

11:28.569 --> 11:29.350
Good apology.

11:32.618 --> 11:37.282
Ruffians, you'll just have to dogeza for Fuwawa, okay?

11:37.542 --> 11:38.043
Okay.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.484
I did nothing wrong.

11:39.724 --> 11:44.809
No dogeza, okay?

11:46.030 --> 11:52.856
There might be something a bit more to... Ruffians.

11:54.857 --> 11:55.418
There's been...

11:56.033 --> 11:58.735
Another misunderstanding.

11:59.295 --> 12:03.777
You know, we were getting a bit crazy doing Donkey Kong Country today.

12:04.298 --> 12:05.698
Ruffians, you noticed, right?

12:06.299 --> 12:06.599
Right.

12:06.859 --> 12:07.119
Right?

12:07.139 --> 12:10.621
Like, five minutes after we started, it was already getting crazy.

12:11.061 --> 12:11.642
Just a bit.

12:11.942 --> 12:14.883
We were laughing and screaming a lot.

12:15.644 --> 12:17.165
Maybe a bit too much.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.327
It wasn't getting out of hand, right?

12:21.127 --> 12:22.408
I think it was getting out of hand.

12:22.428 --> 12:23.488
We didn't turn into monkeys, right?

12:23.508 --> 12:24.189
We're dogs!

12:24.629 --> 12:25.589
Not monkeys!

12:25.689 --> 12:25.909
Right?

12:26.690 --> 12:29.711
Is this what you mean by putting the dog in the monkey?

12:30.011 --> 12:31.552
Is that what we did yesterday?

12:31.572 --> 12:32.332
We became the monkey?

12:32.372 --> 12:33.773
Maybe that's what it is.

12:34.113 --> 12:34.493
Maybe.

12:34.913 --> 12:39.876
But we did talk about, you know, how when we were...

12:41.192 --> 12:43.073
Actually... Actually... You know...

13:04.255 --> 13:05.676
It wasn't even a full game.

13:05.696 --> 13:07.457
It wasn't!

13:07.537 --> 13:10.259
It wasn't a full game!

13:10.319 --> 13:15.263
It was just a demo disc for a Crash Bandicoot game that came with the magazine.

13:15.363 --> 13:16.644
It was just a trial!

13:17.024 --> 13:18.065
Just a trial!

13:18.085 --> 13:25.190
But we would scream and laugh so hard for it that we were told that we're not allowed to play it.

13:25.590 --> 13:30.414
So I've never properly played a ba- a- Crash Bandicoot.

13:30.434 --> 13:34.578
I can't say it!

13:34.618 --> 13:36.079
Can you say it?

13:36.259 --> 13:39.342
Crash Bandicoot game.

13:39.842 --> 13:40.282
Yeah.

13:40.683 --> 13:45.447
But I wonder though if the game is that fun and crazy just like that one level was.

13:47.628 --> 13:48.449
It might not be good.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.690
It could lead to destruction.

13:51.235 --> 14:05.103
Maybe we should stay away from it but... It's more misunderstandings!

14:05.123 --> 14:06.584
It's not good!

14:07.425 --> 14:10.126
Not good!

14:10.647 --> 14:12.568
Ruffians, what is this destruction?

14:12.588 --> 14:13.929
What is this chaos?

14:17.156 --> 14:22.578
Obviously, it's still too much of a morning for me, huh?

14:22.978 --> 14:25.118
No misunderstandings understood.

14:25.678 --> 14:25.978
Got it.

14:25.998 --> 14:26.899
That's good.

14:27.339 --> 14:28.599
No more misunderstandings.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.040
No more misunderstandings.

14:30.140 --> 14:30.920
Right, Moco-chan?

14:32.200 --> 14:32.600
No.

14:33.120 --> 14:33.381
No.

14:34.201 --> 14:36.741
There's more misunderstandings!

14:38.202 --> 14:45.784
Unfortunately, there was most likely our biggest misunderstanding to date yesterday.

14:46.601 --> 14:50.544
Yet again, yesterday, doing Donkey Kong Country.

14:50.564 --> 14:54.747
But I guess it was a little bit after that.

14:54.787 --> 14:57.069
It wasn't a very good day for us, huh?

14:57.129 --> 14:59.991
Lots of misunderstandings, lots of apologies.

15:00.011 --> 15:06.916
There was a Ruffian who asked if they could live in Moco-chan's belly button.

15:09.118 --> 15:10.178
Ruffians, was that you?

15:10.198 --> 15:11.679
Was that you?

15:11.699 --> 15:11.760
Huh?

15:15.595 --> 15:16.156
Ruffians!

15:17.197 --> 15:18.038
It wasn't, was it?

15:18.859 --> 15:19.039
No.

15:19.059 --> 15:20.220
Right.

15:20.640 --> 15:28.189
Well, well, well, to explain, you know... I guess, without thinking...

15:29.235 --> 15:32.196
I started to think about how much we could rent it out for.

15:32.616 --> 15:36.778
You know, and there was a ruffian that suggested $200 an hour.

15:36.798 --> 15:39.979
And you know, I thought that was pretty reasonable.

15:40.279 --> 15:41.279
How could you?

15:41.659 --> 15:57.265
But in my excitement, you know, thinking that if we rent in Moco-chan's belly button like a share house, it would make a lot of ruffians smile, I forgot to think about my little sister's comfort, and maybe what she wanted, what would be best for her.

15:58.809 --> 15:59.269
I'm sorry.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.631
I'm sorry for getting carried away, Ruffians.

16:01.991 --> 16:03.492
I-I don't think that covers it.

16:04.433 --> 16:05.014
I'm sorry.

16:05.314 --> 16:14.801
You know, the Ruffian smiles are important, and I do want to make a lot of Ruffians smile, but not at the cost of Moco-chan's smile too, right?

16:15.401 --> 16:15.762
Right!

16:17.403 --> 16:18.403
Unless, Moco-chan!

16:19.224 --> 16:21.306
Would you be okay with sharing your belly button?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.124
How dare you even ask?

16:25.384 --> 16:30.326
Are you really apologizing and then asking that?

16:31.206 --> 16:31.667
I don't know.

16:31.687 --> 16:34.108
I never got an answer, so... You did.

16:34.708 --> 16:34.948
When?

16:35.708 --> 16:36.489
Yesterday!

16:36.509 --> 16:38.930
I don't remember.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.350
Maybe I'm too excited.

16:40.730 --> 16:41.211
Good.

16:42.691 --> 16:43.812
I saw you, Moco-chan.

16:45.274 --> 16:47.596
I am not sharing my belly button!

16:47.696 --> 16:48.277
Okay!

16:48.297 --> 16:49.938
It is mine.

16:49.958 --> 16:53.741
We're not renting out Moco-chan's belly button.

16:53.761 --> 16:55.322
We're not doing a share house thing.

16:55.342 --> 16:58.705
I'm not happy having it up big on the screen either!

17:01.147 --> 17:02.067
Stop looking.

17:03.489 --> 17:03.949
It's big.

17:04.209 --> 17:04.970
Big belly button.

17:05.803 --> 17:06.944
What do you mean by that?

17:08.064 --> 17:08.744
Hard.

17:09.225 --> 17:12.046
Well, the misunderstanding is cleared now, right?

17:12.146 --> 17:12.506
Is it?

17:12.866 --> 17:13.227
Right.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.027
Is it though?

17:16.968 --> 17:18.249
Yeah.

17:18.549 --> 17:18.789
No!

17:18.809 --> 17:19.669
Ruffians!

17:20.470 --> 17:21.730
Don't look, okay?

17:22.031 --> 17:22.731
Don't look!

17:28.104 --> 17:29.165
Ah, Moco-chan.

17:29.285 --> 17:31.306
Yeah, this is definitely dogeza.

17:32.127 --> 17:32.447
Yeah.

17:33.308 --> 17:33.768
It's okay.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.989
The ruffians are gonna dogeza for me, right?

17:36.790 --> 17:37.891
And then it'll be okay.

17:38.131 --> 17:40.492
They'll dogeza for even just thinking about it.

17:41.873 --> 17:42.674
But Moco-chan!

17:42.754 --> 17:45.296
Moco-chan, you have something that you need to confess, right?

17:47.477 --> 17:47.677
Yeah.

17:48.638 --> 17:51.159
Why do you make it seem like we're equal now, huh?

17:51.319 --> 17:52.000
Cause we are.

17:52.100 --> 17:52.820
We are!

17:53.001 --> 17:54.942
We're equal because we're twins, right?

17:56.277 --> 17:57.938
That's not how it works.

17:58.399 --> 17:59.079
Ruffians!

18:00.000 --> 18:03.042
I feel like we've already talked about this a lot today.

18:03.062 --> 18:05.044
But maybe the Ruffians don't understand.

18:05.064 --> 18:06.825
So we'll explain it again.

18:08.466 --> 18:11.129
Ruffians, you know who Pero is, right?

18:11.229 --> 18:11.569
Right.

18:11.889 --> 18:13.390
You haven't forgotten, right?

18:13.430 --> 18:13.811
Right.

18:14.191 --> 18:17.173
Just because Pero's kind of... a bit... missing.

18:17.293 --> 18:17.714
Missing.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.615
Yeah, but... Maybe!

18:22.970 --> 18:24.372
Enough Pero.

18:24.392 --> 18:25.794
I feel like that's a bit of an overstatement.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.858
You know, we're going to the backwoods to find Pero on Thursday, right?

18:30.099 --> 18:30.399
Right.

18:30.699 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.420 --> 18:40.131
But you know with how mean and rude Pero can be, maybe there's some ruffians that are kind of like, why would FUWAMOCO want to go find him?

18:40.151 --> 18:40.531
Right!

18:41.252 --> 18:45.773
You know, he is our pet, and as owners, we are also responsible for him.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.333
We have a responsibility.

18:48.134 --> 18:52.614
And you know, I guess he has taught us a few new tricks in the past too.

18:53.395 --> 18:59.096
But you know, when Pero's not being rude and saying bad things, he's actually pretty helpful.

18:59.616 --> 19:00.936
He's not awful all the time.

19:01.716 --> 19:02.937
He can have his good points.

19:04.517 --> 19:11.183
You know, I'm sure a lot of Ruffians have noticed, but since debut, things have been pretty busy at the Abyssgard home team.

19:11.824 --> 19:12.625
It's busy!

19:12.965 --> 19:20.592
We've been doing our best to prep and practice and stream as much as we can to get used to all the new things in our world now.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.536
Pero's been helping us quite a bit too.

19:25.237 --> 19:28.840
He's missing now, but... You might be surprised.

19:29.761 --> 19:32.082
He does kind of have a bit of a creative side.

19:32.582 --> 19:33.123
Somehow.

19:33.423 --> 19:33.903
Somehow.

19:34.063 --> 19:35.464
In the roundness.

19:35.484 --> 19:36.805
There's a side.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.766
There's a side in the roundness.

19:38.926 --> 19:39.446
Yeah.

19:39.666 --> 19:46.549
You know, he helps us out with the graphics and thumbnails and sometimes even video editing too, you know.

19:46.589 --> 19:48.530
Somehow he does it all with those little wings.

19:48.550 --> 19:48.630
Yeah.

19:49.831 --> 19:54.033
But we only have four paws between the both of us and they're only 24 hours a day, so...

19:55.794 --> 19:57.395
We're really thankful.

19:58.535 --> 20:00.416
But I can do those things too.

20:00.777 --> 20:02.277
We could.

20:02.417 --> 20:05.059
But you're just really slow.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.042
But if Pero does it, then Moco-chan isn't as annoying.

20:11.182 --> 20:12.262
I'm not annoying.

20:12.323 --> 20:16.265
If it's me doing it, she always comes up with all these requests once I'm done.

20:16.285 --> 20:21.007
You know, if it's Pero, then Moco-chan knows that she can't bark orders at him.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.328
I don't bark orders.

20:23.028 --> 20:24.489
Maybe bark orders as much.

20:26.009 --> 20:28.370
But that's why we're really thankful to Pero.

20:29.051 --> 20:34.373
And you know things have been getting busier and busier, so that's why we need to find him!

20:34.413 --> 20:35.033
Yeah!

20:35.133 --> 20:35.594
Soon!

20:35.694 --> 20:36.694
ASAP!

20:37.114 --> 20:39.475
Let's do our best to get him back, okay Ruffians?

20:40.176 --> 20:40.496
Got it?

20:41.256 --> 20:43.217
We're gonna find him.

20:43.237 --> 20:44.317
In the back room.

20:44.337 --> 20:44.798
I need your help.

20:45.798 --> 20:46.238
Please help.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.059
Please help.

20:48.079 --> 20:49.099
But I need a lot of help.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.978
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

21:06.079 --> 21:09.882
A cutie!

21:10.243 --> 21:12.905
He really does look like a trucker.

21:13.025 --> 21:16.307
A trucker dog of the day.

21:16.327 --> 21:17.729
He's a working dog, you know?

21:17.789 --> 21:19.610
Very busy.

21:19.950 --> 21:22.012
I've been to here, I've been to there.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.254
I've seen lots of things on this road.

21:24.614 --> 21:24.934
Right?

21:24.994 --> 21:25.795
Like that?

21:26.135 --> 21:26.596
Seasoned.

21:28.397 --> 21:32.639
Maybe like, I've helped lost puppies across the entire continent.

21:32.979 --> 21:34.020
Making families.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.261
Come together!

21:39.963 --> 21:40.843
Look at the elbow.

21:40.863 --> 21:42.444
The elbow actually has it.

21:43.004 --> 21:45.505
That's the true sign of a pro there.

21:45.925 --> 21:47.586
And a little jacket.

21:47.626 --> 21:48.647
Very fashionable.

21:49.747 --> 21:55.430
There's such a tiny, tiny doggy for the day.

21:55.850 --> 21:58.071
Lots of attitude.

21:58.151 --> 21:58.911
Professional.

21:59.111 --> 22:01.412
I want to know his name though.

22:01.892 --> 22:05.174
If he drives like a Kei-tora, then maybe Kei.

22:05.194 --> 22:10.316
Actually, FUWAMOCO, we don't have a driver's license.

22:10.356 --> 22:11.437
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

22:39.665 --> 22:41.266
Not louder, like a BAU BAU!

22:41.286 --> 22:44.689
Or like a BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

22:44.709 --> 22:45.750
Like that.

22:45.950 --> 22:46.350
Maybe.

22:48.612 --> 22:54.757
Well, I would say, you know, he looks like the kind of dog that nothing bothers him, you know?

22:54.977 --> 22:57.640
Whether he's out on a drive or a walk.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.821
Yeah, he's a pro!

22:58.861 --> 22:59.761
Professional!

22:59.861 --> 23:08.288
But, you know, I kind of feel like, even though he really likes the seat of a truck, I think the thing that he loves most is being in your arms.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.508
He wouldn't admit it though.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.050
Yeah, but a bit cuddly.

23:13.510 --> 23:14.531
A bit cuddly, yeah.

23:15.412 --> 23:16.273
Thank you!

23:16.293 --> 23:18.635
BAU BAU!

23:20.217 --> 23:24.481
And next for today, I went on a walk.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.112
This is a cute one.

23:31.253 --> 23:34.335
We have a cute orange cat!

23:34.696 --> 23:38.579
I love the ripple in the center.

23:38.599 --> 23:40.021
Look at the cheeks.

23:40.101 --> 23:42.103
We got some round cheeks.

23:42.403 --> 23:43.504
Very very regal.

23:43.644 --> 23:45.146
This is a very good walk.

23:47.287 --> 23:50.109
We went on a walk and we had some teppanyaki.

23:50.209 --> 23:52.851
Saw some cute sights.

23:52.991 --> 23:55.473
Yeah, a cat on top of a dessert cart.

23:55.553 --> 23:57.514
Cats and desserts.

23:58.375 --> 23:59.436
It's the perfect dessert.

23:59.576 --> 24:01.417
That's like whipped cream on top of whipped cream.

24:01.537 --> 24:01.977
Right?

24:02.978 --> 24:05.300
Yeah, this dessert looks delicious.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.500
Very delicious.

24:06.821 --> 24:09.222
Is that a tiny little tail I see too?

24:09.442 --> 24:10.103
I think so.

24:12.403 --> 24:15.625
We hope you enjoyed the Lemon Tart!

24:15.665 --> 24:17.166
The other dessert is for me.

24:17.186 --> 24:19.427
This really looks like the perfect walk.

24:20.067 --> 24:23.269
Fresh air, yummy food, and a cat for dessert.

24:23.289 --> 24:24.530
Thank you!

24:25.311 --> 24:29.153
BAU BAU!

24:29.293 --> 24:30.614
So cute!

24:32.508 --> 24:38.093
Next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

24:38.653 --> 24:40.675
Have FUWAMOCO ever worn a kimono?

24:41.035 --> 24:44.118
What kind of costume would you guys like to wear in a new costume?

24:44.138 --> 24:46.160
Thank you for adding color to my life!

24:46.260 --> 24:46.940
BAU BAU!

24:46.980 --> 24:47.861
Thank you!

24:51.735 --> 24:55.217
Unfortunately, we never wore any kimono, but we have worn yukata before!

24:55.257 --> 24:57.658
Yeah, we really want to wear kimono as well.

24:57.678 --> 24:57.778
Right?

24:57.818 --> 25:08.642
Yeah, when we were doing Guard Dog Training in Japan, I kind of had a bit of a habit where I like to look at used kimono sets and secondhand clothing apps.

25:09.063 --> 25:11.784
It was really tempting, but just looking.

25:11.824 --> 25:12.524
Just window shopping.

25:12.584 --> 25:14.065
Yeah, window shopping is fun.

25:14.925 --> 25:18.847
But you know, I think we definitely have a hard time putting them on.

25:20.046 --> 25:23.849
Just putting the yukata on ourselves, it would take us like four hours.

25:23.929 --> 25:26.651
It's very difficult on your own.

25:26.671 --> 25:30.834
It's a bit of a process, but you know, they're so pretty.

25:31.415 --> 25:33.556
But it's also very important to wear it properly.

25:33.596 --> 25:36.378
Especially, you don't want it falling off, right?

25:36.618 --> 25:37.659
No!

25:37.919 --> 25:38.680
No, yeah.

25:40.120 --> 25:46.784
We'd like to try wearing Japanese clothing in the future, but it'd also be really fun to learn how to make the fabrics too.

25:46.884 --> 25:49.106
We'd like to try lots of different things.

25:49.126 --> 25:51.427
Four hours each, four hours together.

25:51.447 --> 25:51.928
Together.

25:52.168 --> 25:53.028
Not that long.

25:53.128 --> 25:54.289
Four hours together.

25:54.649 --> 25:55.350
It's manageable.

25:55.410 --> 25:57.992
I can help Moco-chan, Moco-chan can help me.

25:59.413 --> 26:00.934
No malfunctions allowed.

26:03.275 --> 26:07.418
We want to try lots of different things, but I think the Ruffians know that, right?

26:07.758 --> 26:14.383
But Ruffians, we're always looking for more submissions for the Pero Sightings with all your day, your walks, and of course questions.

26:14.723 --> 26:18.406
Please submit them with the hashtag FWMCMORNING.

26:18.426 --> 26:20.767
Thank you, Ruffians!

26:21.348 --> 26:24.910
Well, let's take a look at our next stream.

26:25.731 --> 26:26.511
De-den!

26:27.512 --> 26:31.374
We have more Super Chat Readings!

26:31.814 --> 26:33.515
Thank you so much, Ruffians.

26:33.535 --> 26:38.837
We're gonna be reading more of the Super Chats from our monetization celebration.

26:39.277 --> 26:40.738
We're still going through it.

26:40.898 --> 26:43.539
Thank you.

26:43.739 --> 26:45.800
Please let us take the time to thank you.

26:47.361 --> 26:48.641
It might take us a little while.

26:48.661 --> 26:53.903
A little bit, but... You know, let's have lots of fun chit-chatting and being silly while we do stuff, okay?

26:53.923 --> 26:57.424
We're really looking forward to it, so we hope that you'll be there with us.

26:57.504 --> 26:58.664
Too many!

26:58.704 --> 26:59.724
Not too many!

26:59.764 --> 27:01.025
No, never, never, never.

27:01.045 --> 27:02.125
We'll be very happy.

27:02.165 --> 27:05.866
Yeah, but hopefully, you know, there won't be any more misunderstandings.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.607
Hopefully.

27:09.947 --> 27:10.187
Yeah.

27:11.175 --> 27:13.016
Thank you, Ruffians!

27:13.476 --> 27:18.759
Let's take another peek at our schedule.

27:18.959 --> 27:22.501
It's an Extra Special Busy Week.

27:22.561 --> 27:23.381
Lots of fun.

27:23.401 --> 27:30.805
We're going to be celebrating our 500K Ruffians this week.

27:31.105 --> 27:33.847
It's going to be a busy weekend, but also a lot of fun.

27:35.029 --> 27:43.113
So we're going to be kicking off this celebration first with some chatting about our feelings and talking a bit more about what you mean to us.

27:43.373 --> 27:48.075
But then we're going to continue it with a rare, unarchived Rock n' Rawr Party!

27:48.095 --> 27:48.675
Yeah!

27:48.695 --> 27:50.956
What could we be singing, huh, Ruffians?

27:51.697 --> 27:52.057
Huh?

27:52.757 --> 27:58.440
It's unarchived, so... At least this time we're going to try singing a lot of songs that...

28:00.340 --> 28:01.481
Maybe we don't really know.

28:01.501 --> 28:05.843
But you know, you might know them really well.

28:05.863 --> 28:10.485
It's gonna be a very different type of Rock n' Rawr Party.

28:10.965 --> 28:11.525
Get ready.

28:11.845 --> 28:14.386
Get ready for it, okay?

28:15.267 --> 28:17.227
Copyrighted songs, they're always copyrighted.

28:21.975 --> 28:23.776
I'm excited but also nervous.

28:23.856 --> 28:24.137
Really.

28:24.377 --> 28:28.479
Please get ready, okay?

28:28.520 --> 28:32.082
You might wanna maybe prepare something for your tummy.

28:32.222 --> 28:35.624
You might start hurting really fast at the ears too.

28:35.644 --> 28:37.706
Maybe some water.

28:37.906 --> 28:43.269
But you're gonna sing with us too, right?

28:43.730 --> 28:44.430
Right.

28:44.670 --> 28:45.291
We need your help.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.193
I mean, we don't need help.

28:48.273 --> 28:49.734
No, why would we ever need help?

28:49.854 --> 28:51.755
No, no, we're good.

28:51.895 --> 28:54.957
Well, Ruffians, thank you so much for joining us today.

28:54.977 --> 28:55.798
Thank you!

28:55.898 --> 28:58.219
Thank you!

28:58.580 --> 29:01.241
Next time's gonna be our 10th movie.

29:01.802 --> 29:02.422
Already.
