Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:13.866 --> 05:17.415
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.515 --> 05:19.219
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:20.445 --> 05:24.427

05:25.987 --> 05:28.648
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:28.828 --> 05:31.029
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:31.149 --> 05:32.970
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:32.990 --> 05:35.010
BAU BAU BAU!

05:35.231 --> 05:39.232
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.792 --> 05:43.314
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 26th episode!

05:43.594 --> 05:44.434
And you know,

05:47.455 --> 05:48.556
End of another week.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.236
Right!

05:49.577 --> 05:51.738
We did it!

05:52.179 --> 06:01.125
Well, for Ruffians who are joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:01.145 --> 06:02.066
A.K.A.

06:02.146 --> 06:03.287
FUWAMOCO!

06:03.827 --> 06:07.070
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:07.610 --> 06:12.834
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:13.534 --> 06:14.135
Ruffians.

06:14.864 --> 06:19.185
If you could please do us a favor and tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

06:19.205 --> 06:19.925
Hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:20.265 --> 06:20.745
FWMCMORNING.

06:20.865 --> 06:22.426
That'll make us happy, right, Moco-chan?

06:22.446 --> 06:22.626
BAU BAU!

06:22.666 --> 06:26.026

06:42.010 --> 06:42.910
BAU B

06:44.011 --> 06:49.394
I think we had another Pero Sighting.

06:49.755 --> 06:50.155
De-den!

06:52.156 --> 06:53.257
Oh, it's still summer.

06:54.237 --> 06:58.540
We spotted Pero at a very unique looking indoor pool.

06:59.340 --> 07:03.583
I guess you know Pero probably doesn't want the summer to end either, right?

07:03.643 --> 07:06.124
Yeah, a local pool like that pool is good for that, right?

07:06.525 --> 07:06.965
Right.

07:07.305 --> 07:07.885
It makes sense.

07:10.178 --> 07:12.880
No, that still kind of sounds good to us, too.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.842
Just, you know, the bathing suit part.

07:15.962 --> 07:23.869
Maybe not so much, but... I wonder, you know, Ruffians, do you think that Peron's maybe planning on going for a swim?

07:24.029 --> 07:27.031
Or maybe, maybe just sunbathing?

07:27.552 --> 07:34.097
But, but... If he wants to sunbathe, you usually need oil for that, right?

07:34.397 --> 07:36.059
Maybe he just wants to become a marshmallow.

07:38.018 --> 07:40.839
Pero... A charcoal marshmallow.

07:41.939 --> 07:48.760
That sounds good because you don't need to put the oil on your hands and... He's just... It's bones and marshmallow fluff.

07:49.420 --> 07:50.241
That's not happening.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.821
We're not gonna do that.

07:51.841 --> 08:03.023
But you know, maybe he's just a... swimming or knowing Pero maybe... dare to enjoy the sights of cute bikini girls?

08:06.604 --> 08:07.024
I don't know.

08:09.232 --> 08:11.373
Maybe he doesn't want to swim now.

08:12.654 --> 08:16.097
If that's the case, maybe he doesn't have any intention of doing that.

08:18.078 --> 08:21.981
If you're going to the pool, do proper pool things, you know?

08:24.502 --> 08:24.742
Yeah.

08:24.942 --> 08:26.904
Ruffians, did you enjoy the summer at the pool?

08:29.113 --> 08:29.553
Maybe not.

08:31.895 --> 08:35.579
If you're gonna go to the pool, please do pool things.

08:36.339 --> 08:37.920
BAU BAU!

08:38.061 --> 08:41.163
Ruffians, let us know if you see Pero around, okay?

08:41.784 --> 08:45.147
You can let us know with the hashtag FWMCMORNING!

08:45.487 --> 08:46.668
BAU BAU!

08:48.559 --> 08:48.900
Next!

08:48.960 --> 08:49.360
Ruffians!

08:49.821 --> 08:52.104
We have some exciting news, right?

08:52.484 --> 08:52.965
You know what?

08:53.125 --> 08:54.026
Not today.

08:54.367 --> 08:54.887
Not today.

08:54.927 --> 08:55.368
Tomorrow!

08:55.808 --> 08:59.333
It's Rin-senpai's 3D showcase!

08:59.353 --> 08:59.894
BAU BAU!

09:06.054 --> 09:08.075
We're really hyped.

09:08.736 --> 09:10.957
If you didn't know, we're very hyped.

09:11.357 --> 09:13.158
It's gonna be crazy, Ruffians!

09:13.398 --> 09:17.581
We're hoping to see Bae-senpai show off her dance skills a lot.

09:17.761 --> 09:19.522
Especially to her original songs, too.

09:19.542 --> 09:25.725
Yeah, you know, the Psycho-Lite Connect world was really, really cool, so I'm looking forward to that.

09:25.786 --> 09:28.567
Seeing more, that would be nice.

09:28.807 --> 09:31.129
You know, I'm a silly antics, too.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.330
Can't wait.

09:34.091 --> 09:37.453
Ruffians, what are you looking forward to?

09:37.954 --> 09:41.877
Any ideas or any... You remember now, right?

09:42.798 --> 09:45.660
Yeah, play dice too!

09:45.760 --> 09:46.381
Right!

09:46.741 --> 09:49.683
I wanna see play dice.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.646
I wonder what the choreography would be like for that too.

09:53.692 --> 09:55.594
Have to look forward to it!

09:55.674 --> 09:58.878
No matter what, it's going to be very cute!

09:58.978 --> 10:02.582
Congratulations Bijou-pai!

10:02.622 --> 10:05.966
Let's all look forward to it, okay Ruffians?

10:06.527 --> 10:09.010
Very soon, very soon, very soon!

10:09.090 --> 10:13.915
But that's not it for exciting news happening tomorrow, right?

10:14.795 --> 10:16.176
There's also... Nobisa!

10:16.977 --> 10:26.163
Nobisa has a new cover song coming out, and this time, it's Dekonina's Vampire!

10:26.603 --> 10:33.728
It's gonna be premiering on Nobisa's channel, of course, at 5PM PT and 9AM GST.

10:33.888 --> 10:37.411
Imagine if it was on FUWAMOCO's channel, huh?

10:37.711 --> 10:39.172
That would definitely make sense, right?

10:41.313 --> 10:43.455
Nerissa's been doing an amazing job with all her cover songs.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.776
She's been knocking it out of the park.

10:47.157 --> 10:50.039
I'm really excited to see how Vampire will be done this time.

10:50.059 --> 10:52.500
Yeah, and this time it's going to be in English, right?

10:52.941 --> 10:55.622
Yeah, we really love, love me, love me, love me.

10:55.642 --> 10:56.763
We really loved, love me.

10:56.923 --> 10:57.423
We did.

10:57.884 --> 11:00.605
We love, love me, love me, love me.

11:00.806 --> 11:01.626
Love, love, love, love.

11:01.666 --> 11:05.208
I can't wait what it's going to be like this time.

11:05.488 --> 11:07.129
I wonder how it will sound in English.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.471
With Nerissa's vocals.

11:11.122 --> 11:11.742
It sounds good.

11:12.103 --> 11:12.483
I'm sure.

11:14.303 --> 11:15.264
Don't tell Nerissa.

11:15.304 --> 11:18.965
We can't wait to hear Nerissa!

11:19.025 --> 11:21.106
Ruffians, have you heard of Vampire before?

11:21.226 --> 11:22.687
You've heard it before, right?

11:22.707 --> 11:24.567
I imagine.

11:24.747 --> 11:25.048
Right.

11:28.229 --> 11:32.811
Well, I think the song's playfulness will really suit her voice, too.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.031
BAU BAU!

11:37.432 --> 11:38.853
Well, Ruffians...

11:40.748 --> 11:43.671
We have a bit of a confession.

11:44.793 --> 11:45.914
A bit of a confession.

11:47.296 --> 11:51.981
We noticed that you noticed.

11:52.742 --> 11:53.503
Something funny.

11:54.082 --> 11:54.662
On Twitter?

11:54.842 --> 11:55.363
I don't know.

11:55.523 --> 11:57.964
I feel like the Ruffians don't notice much sometimes.

11:58.044 --> 12:04.666
Especially when we asked you last FUWAMOCO Morning if you noticed anything particularly funny about our Twitter.

12:05.627 --> 12:06.827
Nothing's funny, ever.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.348
Some Ruffians mentioned it too.

12:10.409 --> 12:14.370
Yeah, so we thought that it might be good to confess about this.

12:15.030 --> 12:15.391
You know?

12:15.711 --> 12:18.852
There's no weird feelings, right?

12:19.812 --> 12:21.133
Just honesty, right?

12:22.520 --> 12:29.531
Yeah, well, you know, there was, there was this thing.

12:30.733 --> 12:31.374
This thing?

12:31.534 --> 12:33.357
Yeah, welcome fest, welcome fest!

12:34.659 --> 12:37.203
It's about who liked

12:38.143 --> 12:39.564
It's really cute!

12:39.864 --> 12:44.706
It's Choco-sensei-senpai in a bunny outfit!

12:45.066 --> 12:45.446
It's cute!

12:53.895 --> 12:55.615
I don't know what the Ruffians got.

13:22.307 --> 13:23.628
It's like a speeding car.

13:27.192 --> 13:32.917
Well, you know, Ruffians, it can't really help but like it.

13:33.338 --> 13:36.181
I'm going.

13:36.681 --> 13:41.706
Speeding car.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.168
At first, you know,

13:46.138 --> 13:47.778
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:11.664 --> 14:18.249
But meanwhile, Moco-chan on the other hand, you happened to see it and what did you do?

14:18.269 --> 14:20.570
I liked it!

14:22.632 --> 14:23.312
I made the call.

14:23.772 --> 14:29.256
I only found out that we had liked it once the Ruffians started mentioning it.

14:30.257 --> 14:31.898
I was so surprised!

14:33.639 --> 14:36.761
The proper little sister thing.

14:37.341 --> 14:38.382
That's the story.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.623
That's a confession.

14:41.946 --> 14:44.748
You can't blame us, right, Ruffians?

14:44.908 --> 14:47.650
It's hard not to give in to Choco-sensei-senpai's cute charms, right?

14:47.730 --> 14:55.214
I thought you were gonna say it's hard not to give in to Choco-sensei-senpai!

14:56.255 --> 14:56.635
No!

14:57.075 --> 14:58.536
Her charms, you know?

15:00.717 --> 15:02.238
Understandable.

15:02.458 --> 15:02.778
Thank you.

15:02.798 --> 15:05.799
That's how Twitter usually goes for us.

15:06.299 --> 15:11.741
So don't misunderstand that only one of us ever does one thing on Twitter, okay?

15:11.941 --> 15:13.262
It's always a group effort.

15:13.302 --> 15:13.922
We're a team.

15:13.962 --> 15:14.823
We're FUWAMOCO, okay?

15:14.883 --> 15:15.883
Face up this time.

15:17.711 --> 15:18.912
Do you feel lighter now?

15:18.972 --> 15:19.152
Maybe.

15:19.172 --> 15:19.713
BAU BAU!

15:38.942 --> 15:42.305
You know, I feel like we've had enough happy news today.

15:42.785 --> 15:43.065
No!

15:43.085 --> 15:43.125
No!

15:43.486 --> 15:44.166
It doesn't end!

15:44.226 --> 15:44.787
I don't know!

15:45.207 --> 15:47.669
We have more happy news, Ruffians!

15:48.590 --> 15:49.430
Wow.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.112
Do Ruffians want more happy news?

15:51.132 --> 15:51.792
Yeah!

15:52.233 --> 15:55.876
It's the end of the week, it's Friday, we can have lots of happy news.

15:56.176 --> 15:56.436
Okay.

15:56.536 --> 16:01.060
Well, Ruffians, it's not only Friday, but it's the end of the month already.

16:01.140 --> 16:01.920
Can you believe it?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.642
Do you know what this means?

16:06.187 --> 16:09.068
That means... It's been two months since we debuted!

16:09.088 --> 16:11.649
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

16:11.669 --> 16:12.610
Two months already!

16:12.630 --> 16:15.671
Yeah... It doesn't feel like it, huh?

16:16.051 --> 16:24.875
You know, we thought that we'd like to celebrate a little and be able to show our appreciation for you being here with us for the past two months.

16:25.355 --> 16:31.018
So we thought we'd do another... Roar and Response on Twitter!

16:31.298 --> 16:32.338
We did it last month, but...

16:37.666 --> 16:41.370
And this time, we're gonna be holding it today!

16:41.410 --> 16:41.971
Today!

16:42.071 --> 16:46.835
After I stream from 9.30pm PT or 1.30pm JST.

16:46.876 --> 16:50.819
Today, we're doing YMS VICE's lip-hair battle!

16:50.840 --> 16:51.821
Let's do it!

16:53.542 --> 17:00.044
And we'll be responding to your tweets as fast as our paws can type for one hour and a half.

17:00.164 --> 17:01.504
It's completely random, okay?

17:01.544 --> 17:08.666
So we won't be able to respond to every Ruffian, but please know that we are reading your tweets just like normal, okay?

17:08.846 --> 17:13.847
And you know, last time we had over 1,600 responses.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.287
Thank you!

17:15.327 --> 17:18.848
We did our absolute best to respond, and what time we had...

17:19.368 --> 17:21.630
It's a bit difficult sometimes.

17:21.970 --> 17:27.113
Ruffians, how fast do your paws type?

17:27.133 --> 17:29.934
I don't think you should be that impressed.

17:31.775 --> 17:34.517
To be able to participate is not hard.

17:34.957 --> 17:39.540
Please respond to our tweet about the live response that we're gonna make this time.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.201
And this time we'd like to ask

17:41.641 --> 17:43.002
Something a little bit new.

17:43.422 --> 17:48.705
Please use the hashtag, hashtag FUWAMOCO in your tweet, in your response.

17:48.805 --> 17:49.365
It's okay.

17:49.385 --> 17:54.148
There'll be a lot, uh, not a lot, but there'll be information, so don't worry if you don't catch it all right now.

17:54.188 --> 18:00.452
We're looking forward to being able to chat over Twitter, Ruffians!

18:00.532 --> 18:01.392
BAU BAU!

18:01.432 --> 18:03.873
Don't worry about tapings though.

18:03.934 --> 18:07.796
The only person that needs to be worried about that is us, our people.

18:08.996 --> 18:10.057
People, not person.

18:11.157 --> 18:16.100
We're gonna do our best to write as fast as we can, right Moco-chan?

18:16.460 --> 18:19.061
It was a bit of a panic last time.

18:19.101 --> 18:29.446
But it was really fun, so... We wanna do it again to just feel the show, our feelings, our things, you know?

18:30.407 --> 18:31.967
Let's have lots of fun on Twitter!

18:32.187 --> 18:33.048
BAU BAU!

18:33.088 --> 18:34.208
Well...

18:37.603 --> 18:45.528
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format show, so already we're gonna find out.

18:45.828 --> 18:48.990
Do you have a Doggie of the Day today, Moco-chan?

18:49.010 --> 18:52.872
My Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

18:52.992 --> 18:54.853
Little Mishka!

18:56.354 --> 18:57.535
Don't think Mishka's little?

18:58.777 --> 19:00.959
Mishka looks very, very strong.

19:00.979 --> 19:02.561
Strong?

19:03.101 --> 19:10.268
Well, you know, just like these Ruffians told us, Mishka can really, really have a lot of energy.

19:10.288 --> 19:12.009
We can definitely see that.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.572
Yeah, I think Mishka could run very, very fast.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.593
Faster than me.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.655
I was gonna say that it looks like she might just fly away.

19:18.715 --> 19:19.416
Right!

19:19.436 --> 19:21.078
Like she has some wings on her.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.340
The tail is one wing at least.

19:23.360 --> 19:23.720
Right?

19:23.780 --> 19:24.501
That's what I was thinking!

19:24.821 --> 19:25.561
Little Mishka.

19:25.981 --> 19:26.382
Mini Mishka.

19:26.402 --> 19:30.083
I feel like, you know, with all this energy I'd be like, kind of unendingly

19:50.250 --> 19:51.871
Really annoying in a good way, you know?

19:51.952 --> 19:53.012
Annoying in a good way.

19:53.252 --> 20:18.190
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

20:19.031 --> 20:19.952
We'll be good, maybe.

20:19.992 --> 20:20.212
Maybe.

20:20.312 --> 20:22.114
Maybe not.

20:22.414 --> 20:27.259
I think little Mishku, you know, really loves to have fun, but you know what?

20:28.197 --> 20:31.720
She only loves fun because it's fun being with you.

20:33.302 --> 20:39.728
Thank you for keeping this Ruffian smile protected for us.

20:39.968 --> 20:41.950
Let's make this a team effort, okay?

20:42.111 --> 20:43.452
Team effort, okay.

20:43.752 --> 20:47.596
We'll do our best to help her on those really tough days, too.

20:47.616 --> 20:48.697
BAU BAU!

20:48.777 --> 20:49.978
Wow.

20:53.274 --> 20:55.396
Do we have any Ruffians going for a walk?

20:55.656 --> 20:56.337
We have!

20:56.417 --> 21:01.721
It's getting colder so I can understand, but... De-den!

21:02.962 --> 21:05.204
This is such a good photo!

21:05.524 --> 21:07.205
There's a Japanese word you want to teach us?

21:09.193 --> 21:12.436
This is what you call yoemachizuki.

21:12.456 --> 21:14.357
That's so cool.

21:15.298 --> 21:22.424
It's a full moon just the night before it's truly full.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.666
I was noticing it recently, the moon.

21:24.686 --> 21:25.847
It's big.

21:25.987 --> 21:27.368
It's so pretty.

21:30.262 --> 21:30.803
Right!

21:30.863 --> 21:30.963
Oh.

21:48.590 --> 21:52.992
I know that beautiful Japanese word that doesn't quite have a one-to-one meaning in English.

21:53.052 --> 21:54.373
Kind of the commodity, right?

21:54.493 --> 21:54.713
Yeah.

21:55.133 --> 21:56.214
Right, the commodity?

21:56.254 --> 21:57.214
Yeah.

21:57.634 --> 22:00.095
Thank you for the beautiful photo.

22:00.135 --> 22:05.337
We're going for a walk even at night time when it's a little bit spooky, but please don't get lost, okay?

22:05.357 --> 22:07.138
How did you take that photo, though?

22:08.590 --> 22:09.591
BAU BAU!

22:09.611 --> 22:10.111
Nice photo!

22:10.131 --> 22:11.433
Don't howl!

22:12.453 --> 22:14.515
Control yourself!

22:14.595 --> 22:15.756
Drink!

22:15.816 --> 22:17.157
You're better than that.

22:24.904 --> 22:27.066
Well, do we have a question for today?

22:27.306 --> 22:30.048
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

22:30.368 --> 22:32.349
Hi, FUWAMOCO!

22:32.769 --> 22:39.214
Now that we have a few days into autumn in the northern hemisphere, I've been thinking about fall activities.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.015
Do you two have any favorite fall activities?

22:42.436 --> 22:45.678
Or maybe fun fall memories to share?

22:46.538 --> 22:52.302
Well, you know, it's really starting to get nice and autumn-like here in the Northwest Passage, too!

22:53.991 --> 22:54.392
It's nice.

22:55.172 --> 22:55.973
It's wonderful.

22:56.053 --> 22:57.235
It smells good.

22:57.255 --> 22:58.416
Good air.

22:58.877 --> 23:03.442
Crisp air, the leaves, and the flavors of autumn too.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.204
You can smell them.

23:05.744 --> 23:06.785
Yeah.

23:07.246 --> 23:09.989
But I think, you know, we just, we like to go for a walk.

23:10.069 --> 23:10.790
Yeah!

23:11.090 --> 23:13.613
Especially when it's sunny out.

23:14.914 --> 23:21.837
It's nice to just enjoy the nature and the sights of this season changing.

23:21.877 --> 23:26.719
Maybe you know, go on a walk and enjoy it with a warm drink too.

23:26.799 --> 23:28.339
If you're feeling fancy.

23:28.359 --> 23:31.120
For a fancy day.

23:31.541 --> 23:34.462
But as for the specific activities,

23:36.533 --> 23:46.321
I don't know if this counts, but we often, we like to help Momo Puppy and Popo Puppy out by cleaning up, like, the leaves from the leaves that have fallen off the trees, you know?

23:46.521 --> 23:53.226
And you know, sometimes I like to jump into the leaf piles, because, you know, it's fun, initially.

23:53.687 --> 24:03.695
But then, once you're in there, then you're reminded of all the bugs and the spiders and the wet leaves and the dirt and junk that's in there with you, too.

24:06.627 --> 24:11.668
I feel like it's fun in theory, but maybe not so fun in actuality.

24:11.989 --> 24:15.770
I always tell Moco-chan, Moco-chan, don't jump in there, you're not gonna like it.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.950
But I feel like it!

24:17.970 --> 24:19.210
I feel like it.

24:19.270 --> 24:22.531
And then once I'm in there, it's like, oh no, I gotta get out of here.

24:24.612 --> 24:25.132
I don't know.

24:25.152 --> 24:28.913
I think it's better, you know, focus on cleaning up the leaves.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.913
Don't make a mess, don't get dirty.

24:31.153 --> 24:32.474
I can jump into your leaves.

24:35.260 --> 24:37.262
Just make sure there's no spiders.

24:37.302 --> 24:42.087
You can get them all up and then I'll make them go everywhere.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.829
Just enjoying the fall.

24:44.690 --> 24:44.991
It's nice.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.172
It's nice.

24:46.272 --> 24:46.953
It's cozy.

24:47.053 --> 24:50.016
Getting bundled up a little bit.

24:50.516 --> 24:53.199
Let's all enjoy the fall warmth together, okay?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.302
BAU BAU!

24:56.943 --> 24:59.245
We have a stream tonight too!

24:59.265 --> 25:07.955
Our next stream is... We're going back to the hololive servers in Minecraft!

25:07.975 --> 25:09.276
Along with all of Advent!

25:12.399 --> 25:12.980
Second time.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.942
Technically a third time.

25:15.362 --> 25:15.722
But!

25:16.883 --> 25:20.226
Yes, we're going to work harder to build our base, right?

25:20.266 --> 25:20.707
Yeah.

25:21.507 --> 25:23.129
I'm excited, but I don't know.

25:23.149 --> 25:30.616
We're also still really, really super beginners in Minecraft, so I'm not too sure what it takes to build things yet.

25:30.756 --> 25:33.118
I mean, we kind of helped build a little bit.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.020
It didn't really do much, though.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.221
We did our best.

25:36.261 --> 25:37.382
We did our best.

25:37.402 --> 25:37.542
Yeah.

25:38.109 --> 25:40.471
Ruffians, please show us how things work, okay?

25:40.531 --> 25:43.232
Yeah, and thank you for all the tips on Twitter, too!

25:43.393 --> 25:44.233
BAU BAU!

25:44.773 --> 25:48.056
I really want to be able to understand Minecraft a little bit more.

25:48.116 --> 25:51.438
It seems so fun, but I guess there's a lot to learn, huh?

25:52.748 --> 25:55.010
Little by little, little steps, little steps.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.891
A bit overwhelming, but we'll get it.

25:58.212 --> 25:59.013
BAU BAU!

25:59.033 --> 26:03.696
And let's take a peek at our schedule.

26:03.756 --> 26:09.640
Right before Bae-senpai's 3D showcase, we'll be playing Fall Guys with you Ruffians!

26:10.521 --> 26:12.923
It's doggy time!

26:12.943 --> 26:19.868
Please make sure you download Fall Guys, which you can do for free, and get ready to join us for some silly games.

26:20.108 --> 26:25.532
It's okay if you're not very good, if you've never played before, because let's just have fun together, okay?

26:25.792 --> 26:34.699
And we hope to be able to play with as many Ruffians as possible, so maybe if you're able to get into one game, then do your best!

26:36.311 --> 26:37.392
We'll see you next time!

26:57.404 --> 26:59.747
We like kind Ruffians.

26:59.847 --> 27:04.432
I have a feeling though that there might be some Ruffians who are pro Fall Geysers.

27:04.892 --> 27:05.873
What?

27:06.434 --> 27:07.355
They're pros at it.

27:07.395 --> 27:08.857
They're pro Fall Geysers.

27:09.057 --> 27:10.298
Okay.

27:11.459 --> 27:12.561
We'll do our best too.

27:12.921 --> 27:13.662
Yeah.

27:15.589 --> 27:16.210
We're gonna do it!

27:16.390 --> 27:17.311
We're gonna do our best!

27:18.292 --> 27:21.316
Maybe we might try to play a little bit cheeky.

27:21.776 --> 27:22.537
Not dirty, cheeky.

27:22.617 --> 27:25.140
I'm looking forward to it!

27:25.180 --> 27:25.581
BAU BAU!

27:32.111 --> 27:38.436
Today's FUWAMOCO Morning comes to a close, but that just means a new exciting weekend has started!

27:38.576 --> 27:43.139
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

27:43.940 --> 27:50.505
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

27:50.525 --> 27:51.666

27:51.706 --> 27:53.047

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

28:20.083 --> 28:23.245
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
