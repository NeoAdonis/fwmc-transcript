00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.413
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:47.934
BAU BAU!

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.757
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:55.499
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.420
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.281
Yo!

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:00.062
BAU BAU!

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:04.525
And today, we're here with some FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:09.348
Thank you for joining us for our 121st episode!

00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:10.409
Yeah!

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:12.290
BAU BAU!

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.691
Ruffians!

00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:15.252
Did you wake up well?

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:15.312
Hi.

00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:19.975
Fuwawa, I still feel sleepy.

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:20.196
What?

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:21.737
What are you talking about?

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:21.837
Hi.

00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:26.444
Ruffians, why are you confused?

00:05:26.464 --> 00:05:28.246
Did you wake up on the wrong paw?

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:32.890
What do you think, Moco-chan?

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:39.537
Fuwawa, we're just gonna have to make sure that we get them onto the right paw then.

00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:41.038
We'll just go again.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.340
BAU BAU!

00:05:45.536 --> 00:06:01.422
Well, for those Ruffians that are joining us for the first time, I feel sorry for you but, FUWAMOCO Morning, the hashtag Morning Show, held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday, aka FUWAMOCO!

00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:03.803
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:09.568
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:16.094
Please fill your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.318
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.620
BAU BAU!

00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:25.963
Ruffians!

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:31.344
I think we might have some bad news.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:32.586
Oh no.

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:34.507
What is it, Moco-chan?

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.890
What is it, Moco-chan?

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.251
Ruffians.

00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:42.696
There's been another... Pero Sighting!

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:46.199
Why was he spotted this time, Moco-chan?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.340
Killer.

00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:49.062
Dead.

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:55.635
Gosh, are Pokey and Pero both fighting?

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:02.039
It's almost like Pero wants to replace Pokey!

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:04.640
Ruffians!

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.442
Did you think that Pero was Pokey this whole time?

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.483
No, that's Pokey.

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.285
Pokey's kinda weird though, huh, Ruffians?

00:07:15.027 --> 00:07:15.327
Huh?

00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:16.068
Yeah.

00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:17.309
Up 10 anime battles?

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.910
What do you mean by that, huh?

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:22.693
I don't like how Pokey moves.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:28.257
You know, it's like watching an oil spill spread across a field of flowers.

00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:30.458
Nasty.

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:32.119
Ruffians.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.441
Who would you cheer for here, huh?

00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:35.842
Pokey?

00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:36.943
Pero?

00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:40.665
It's like balloons.

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:41.306
No.

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:42.527
Not balloons.

00:07:43.668 --> 00:07:43.968
No.

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:46.016
Ruffians!

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:48.078
I cheer for neither.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:49.940
BAU BAU!

00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:50.981
BAU BAU.

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:52.303
BAU BAU!

00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:54.025
Neither you cheer for FUWAMOCO.

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:55.386
Really?

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:59.210
You cheer for Mococo!

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:00.952
BAU BAU!

00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:02.434
And for Fuwawa, right?

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:03.375
Yeah.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:05.617
BAU BAU!

00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:09.908
Wow, Ruffians!

00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:15.535
You know, not too long ago, it was our first year anniversary celebration.

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:16.556
Do you remember?

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:16.796
Yeah!

00:08:17.217 --> 00:08:18.278
BAU BAU!

00:08:18.378 --> 00:08:20.140
BAU BAU!

00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:24.645
Wow, we also shared our newest song, Born to be BAU with you.

00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:25.967
BAU BAU!

00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:26.868
Moco-chan, be quiet.

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:28.795
Of course, right?

00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:29.856
You remember, right?

00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:31.937
Even bamboo, that's good!

00:08:32.437 --> 00:08:32.817
Yeah!

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:34.177
But also!

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:38.539
We have some new anniversary merch that we share with you too!

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:39.419
Yeah!

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:41.040
Yeah, do you remember?

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.160
Yeah!

00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:43.941
De-den!

00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:47.022
BAU BAU!

00:08:47.082 --> 00:08:47.783
BAU BAU!

00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:51.364
Have you gotten your paws on the real Ruffians?

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:51.464
Yes!

00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:53.625
Let's take a look at them!

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:55.145
Yeah!

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:56.726
First, we have

00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.976
Are FUWAMOCO happy puppy happy?

00:09:00.016 --> 00:09:00.636
There it is!

00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:02.777
Are happy puppy happy?

00:09:03.118 --> 00:09:06.620
You know, perfect for concerts like Breaking Dimensions.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.945
You know, these won't be quite ready for Breaking Dimensions, but you'll still be able to wear it before the next big concert, right?

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.966
And a Pero pussy.

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:18.648
Yeah!

00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:22.490
He's normally very nasty as you know, Ruffians.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.212
But this Pero pussy here

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.091
Actually, extremely cute.

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:32.173
Is that okay to say, Moco-chan?

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:33.033
I said it.

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:34.134
Yeah.

00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:36.676
So, Ruffians!

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:41.139
You might want to get one just so you can kick around.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.440
Just like I did.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.563
I hug sometimes too.

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:47.923
What?

00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:49.204
Never know.

00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:54.794
Well, we also have the BAU BAU Voice Key Team!

00:09:55.494 --> 00:10:00.315
You know, we can BAU BAU wherever you go!

00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:02.676
You can always hear our voice, right?

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:04.156
BAU BAU!

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:10.338
And also, our FUWAMOCO Pair Glasses!

00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:12.058
You know, it's super cute!

00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:16.419
And very helpful keeping you hydrated while watching our streams!

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:17.400
Yeah, you need it!

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.420
Yeah!

00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:23.512
Very very good, yeah.

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:27.715
Well, we hope that you'll check these out in the hololive official shop!

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:31.797
You know, pre-orders end at 6pm September 2nd, JST!

00:10:31.837 --> 00:10:34.298
What's wrong Fuwawa?

00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:35.999
What's wrong Fuwawa?

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:38.721
Nothing, I just felt like you were sort of funny, huh?

00:10:39.876 --> 00:10:41.777
Something may be a bit funny, huh?

00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:42.977
Something's just funny.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.257
No!

00:10:43.717 --> 00:10:46.798
Just a regular FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:10:46.858 --> 00:10:49.219
No, it just felt like it was a bit funny, huh?

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:50.539
Yeah.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.840
So make sure you don't miss out on K-Ruffians!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.420
Yeah.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.682
You know, just think that once it's September, your chance is gone.

00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:00.442
Yeah.

00:11:00.662 --> 00:11:06.066
You know, Ruffians, you know, times only make things tricky.

00:11:06.486 --> 00:11:07.387
Ruffians!

00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:08.888
Moco-chan, what did you just say?

00:11:08.928 --> 00:11:09.968
Ruffians!

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.972
Well, we can't wait until you get your paws on them, okay?

00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:18.154
Make sure you get your paws on them.

00:11:19.194 --> 00:11:20.635
Nothing funny is going on.

00:11:21.836 --> 00:11:23.177
BAU BAU!

00:11:25.198 --> 00:11:25.959
Nothing funny.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.040
Wow.

00:11:28.601 --> 00:11:29.201
Ruffians!

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.541
Are you feeling a bit hot right now?

00:11:33.522 --> 00:11:38.025
Sort of like maybe you have a fever?

00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:45.030
Well, actually, FUWAMOCO, we've been having a bunch of fun at the Rio Full Water Park!

00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:45.611
BAU BAU!

00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:49.514
Along with a bunch of our super heroes!

00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:50.655
BAU BAU!

00:11:50.735 --> 00:11:55.398
And, fun at the water park also means swimsuits!

00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:57.319
Swimsuits!

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.800
Ruffians!

00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:00.963
Do you see here?

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:04.687
We even have our own water slide!

00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:07.611
BAU BAU!

00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.155
There's so much to do and so much to eat and get your paws on.

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.657
You know, there's also...

00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:14.896
A lot of merchandise as well!

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:36.594
So you know if you're looking for something extra summery to do we recommend taking a trip to the Leo Waterpark to check things out. You know.

00:12:36.814 --> 00:12:36.895
That

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:40.718
FUWAMOCO also have water slide, right?

00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:42.420
But Ayame-senpai!

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.644
Ayame-senpai have water slide out of Ayame-senpai's mouth, you know?

00:12:47.965 --> 00:12:51.067
Fukura-senpai and Ayame-senpai!

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:55.440
I didn't say senbei, no.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.020
Kurasenbei.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.721
I didn't say senbei, no.

00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:01.242
What are you saying?

00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:03.102
You're saying silly things again!

00:13:03.122 --> 00:13:06.183
I wonder why I said it silly today, huh?

00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.504
Things are strange, huh?

00:13:08.164 --> 00:13:08.544
Yeah.

00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:13.106
But it'll be funny to slide out of their mouths, huh?

00:13:13.886 --> 00:13:14.266
Yeah?

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:14.626
Yeah.

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:16.507
What a wonderful summer memory!

00:13:16.527 --> 00:13:22.609
I'm so happy to be a part of this special summer event, Ruffians!

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:26.053
Nothing suspicious.

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.974
BAU BAU!

00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:32.637
And us.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:34.578
Ruffians.

00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:37.500
Whoa, you're kinda quiet.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.201
A bit reserved today, huh?

00:13:39.241 --> 00:13:40.061
Ruffians!

00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:40.842
Huh?

00:13:40.962 --> 00:13:42.823
We have some confessions to make.

00:13:43.964 --> 00:13:44.384
Huh?

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.005
Yeah.

00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:47.346
Yeah.

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:49.747
Ruffians!

00:13:50.207 --> 00:13:52.289
We've been bad dogs, huh?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.622
You know, as a part of the whole summer bingo!

00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:03.164
We have something we need to confess.

00:14:03.824 --> 00:14:05.405
We need to confess our things.

00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:05.925
Things.

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:06.125
Things.

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:06.525
Things.

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:11.287
Fuwawa, are you okay?

00:14:11.527 --> 00:14:12.908
No, I'm not okay today.

00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:14.108
Thank you, Fuwawa.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:17.410
Are you feeling extra, extra, extra fluffy?

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.691
I'm feeling extra fluffy, huh?

00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:24.293
You know, we would like to take the time today

00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:30.415
To make a wholehearted confession and apology for our sins.

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:31.655
FUWAMOCO!

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:36.178
First, we need to sleep more.

00:14:37.498 --> 00:14:38.439
BAU BAU.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.482
In the past few days, Ruffians, we streamed so much YouTube!

00:14:44.722 --> 00:14:52.126
YouTube got angry at us and, you know, apparently stopped showing that we were live to Ruffians.

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:54.609
We need to sleep more.

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:57.210
How could YouTube do that to us, huh, Ruffians?

00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:03.872
Also, we still have more to confess.

00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:13.935
We confessed to checking Ruffians' Twitters to find a tweet we wanted to like, but we didn't.

00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:17.673
Because it was at a time that we're Japan.

00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:19.274
We should have been asleep.

00:15:20.275 --> 00:15:22.315
Or it's too quickly after they posted it.

00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:24.937
13 seconds, that's a bit fast.

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:25.537
Yeah.

00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:26.237
Yeah.

00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:28.778
And then you know Ruffians!

00:15:28.998 --> 00:15:30.419
Go to look for it.

00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:31.199
Yeah.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.741
But, it's not there!

00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:36.082
I can't find it.

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.162
You went deleted it!

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:38.703
What the heck Ruffians!

00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:39.543
What are you doing?

00:15:39.623 --> 00:15:39.803
Ha!

00:15:39.883 --> 00:15:41.404
What are you doing?

00:15:41.604 --> 00:15:42.344
Ha!

00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:43.745
Awesome.

00:15:45.763 --> 00:15:49.084
We've confessed to wanting to tweet FUWAMOCHI tweets too.

00:15:50.365 --> 00:15:51.705
Thank goodness we did it!

00:15:52.206 --> 00:15:52.686
Yeah.

00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:54.707
We'll confess.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.927
Do you feel better, Fuwawa?

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.369
I'm not Fuwawa!

00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:02.610
I'm Mococo!

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.052
BAU BAU!

00:16:16.104 --> 00:16:17.030
BAU BAU!

00:17:35.914 --> 00:17:36.795
Oh boy!

00:17:37.195 --> 00:17:38.436
I'm sorry Ruffians!

00:17:39.056 --> 00:17:41.518
That was... technical issues.

00:17:42.379 --> 00:17:45.881
I'm sorry Ruffians, I hope you understand.

00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.925
But you know... Forget about the technical issues because... FORGET!

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:53.807
In just... 2 days!

00:17:53.827 --> 00:17:54.907
2 days!

00:17:54.927 --> 00:17:55.908
3 days!

00:17:55.928 --> 00:17:57.689
Very soon!

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.392
There is... Breaking...

00:18:43.028 --> 00:18:44.308
BAU BAU!

00:18:44.348 --> 00:18:45.829
There's Breaking Dimensions!

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:46.669
Yeah!

00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:58.673
And I'm sure you've heard by now, Ruffians, because of all the excitement that's going on, but hololive English's second origi- I mean, second concert, Breaking Dimensions!

00:18:58.693 --> 00:19:00.533
What are you saying, original?

00:19:00.653 --> 00:19:02.314
It's just hours away!

00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:03.334
BAU BAU!

00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:04.414
Yeah!

00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:12.637
Yeah, it's gonna be held at King's Theater in New York, and it'll be the first time we're on the big stage together with all of Advent!

00:19:13.097 --> 00:19:13.857
I'm nervous.

00:19:14.117 --> 00:19:16.918
It's okay, Moco-chan.

00:19:30.113 --> 00:19:32.215
I'll do my best not to cry!

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:32.836
You better!

00:19:33.116 --> 00:19:33.576
Okay.

00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:35.598
Okay, I promise, Fuwawa.

00:19:35.738 --> 00:19:48.489
But you know, F-F-F-Fuwawians who want to be a part of this big, huge stream of life coming too, you can join us from your home online with a streaming ticket from SPWM.

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:49.390
It's fun!

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.650
E+.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.930
Yeah!

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.911
And then Ruffians!

00:19:54.371 --> 00:20:01.352
That way, you can be extra comfy and cheer and dance as loud as you want from your own home!

00:20:01.372 --> 00:20:02.192
Yeah!

00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:04.412
Exactly!

00:20:05.153 --> 00:20:05.953
And Ruffians!

00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:12.474
Uh, there are some questions of whether you're allowed to stand at the venue, but you are!

00:20:12.814 --> 00:20:13.734
You are!

00:20:14.134 --> 00:20:17.695
You just have to make sure you stay standing in your seat area, okay?

00:20:18.315 --> 00:20:19.075
Understood!

00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:20.456
BAU BAU!

00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:21.837
Ruffians!

00:20:21.877 --> 00:20:24.900
Make sure to be kind to your neighbors too!

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.301
Manners is good!

00:20:26.442 --> 00:20:28.684
I want everyone to be like, wow!

00:20:28.804 --> 00:20:31.606
Ruffians are amazing!

00:20:32.007 --> 00:20:36.131
You know how they like to zoom in close to the audience, right Ruffians?

00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:36.571
Ruffians!

00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:45.514
Well, we'll be looking to see you dancing along and going crazy bau bauing together with us!

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:50.995
So make sure you're howling up a storm, and we're sure the cameras will find you, okay?

00:20:52.656 --> 00:20:56.017
We can't wait to hear your voices, Ruffians!

00:20:58.213 --> 00:21:01.115
Are you still feeling a little nervous, Ruffians?

00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:08.780
Why don't we practice the calls for BAU BAU one more time before breaking dimensions?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.021
Is that a good idea?

00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:12.622
Would you like that, Ruffians?

00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:17.505
BAU BAU!

00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:22.769
One last time before breaking dimensions, okay?

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:24.210
BAU BAU!

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.971
I'm ready, Fuwawa!

00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:27.272
Are you ready, Ruffians?

00:21:29.213 --> 00:21:29.773
Okay.

00:21:30.153 --> 00:21:31.274
Yeah, you're good to go.

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:32.314
BAU BAU!

00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:36.555
And just give Fuwawa a moment, because I'm a bit confused right now.

00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:39.216
Okay.

00:21:39.576 --> 00:21:40.256
Less confused.

00:21:40.276 --> 00:21:42.277
Still confused, but less confused.

00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:44.178
Are your pet mice ready, Ruffians?

00:21:44.198 --> 00:21:44.298
Okay!

00:21:44.318 --> 00:21:44.758
Here we go!

00:21:44.898 --> 00:21:46.098

00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:30.223
BAU BAU!

00:25:40.651 --> 00:25:41.952
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:25:42.772 --> 00:25:46.714
That was fun to be BAUDA!

00:25:47.254 --> 00:25:49.595
BAU BAU!

00:25:50.135 --> 00:25:51.176
How did you do?

00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:53.316
You perfected it!

00:25:53.336 --> 00:25:54.557
BAU BAU!

00:25:54.597 --> 00:25:58.299
Maybe we're still a bit frazzled this morning, huh?

00:25:58.979 --> 00:25:59.279
What?

00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:00.420
Fuwawa!

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.681
Have you woken up on the wrong paw?

00:26:03.701 --> 00:26:05.802
Maybe I'm just a bit frazzled today.

00:26:05.862 --> 00:26:07.263
I feel a bit funny, huh?

00:26:07.743 --> 00:26:07.943
Maybe...

00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:11.257
Maybe a bit harder than normal, huh?

00:26:11.277 --> 00:26:13.599
A little fuzzy, but you should be fluffy!

00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:14.039
A bit.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.560
A bit.

00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:18.841
Yeah.

00:26:20.462 --> 00:26:22.243
You're a good Ruffians, huh?

00:26:24.024 --> 00:26:24.344
Well.

00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:27.506
Moco-chan, you know.

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:29.607
It's not the end of the week, right?

00:26:31.268 --> 00:26:34.390
I guess I could say something to the Ruffians!

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.611
Maybe to give you a little bit of

00:26:37.751 --> 00:26:38.472
BAU BAU!

00:26:38.712 --> 00:26:39.132
Ruffians!

00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:42.715
Do you know what day it is?

00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:57.449
Yeah, you should!

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.834
Because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:04.537
And you're gonna hear straight from me.

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:06.539
Mococo!

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.965
Ruffians, have you been a bit excited recently?

00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:18.252
So much, maybe so much excitement that you feel a bit scared.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:20.571
That's okay!

00:27:21.112 --> 00:27:22.293
That's natural!

00:27:23.014 --> 00:27:27.098
Maybe you've been even feeling a bit sad too.

00:27:27.819 --> 00:27:33.105
Because sometimes there are exciting things going on and you want to go so badly!

00:27:33.546 --> 00:27:36.689
But no matter what, it's just not possible.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.281
Ruffians!

00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:41.202
That's totally normal.

00:27:41.663 --> 00:27:45.006
We can't do everything we want to do all the time.

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.107
It's just not possible.

00:27:47.788 --> 00:27:53.513
But that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy things through other ways that are accessible to you.

00:27:54.073 --> 00:28:05.723
Maybe you can't go directly to an event, but maybe there's a livestream, or people live-tweeting their photos, or stories online, or even friends you can talk to!

00:28:07.889 --> 00:28:08.156
Huh?

00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:25.917
It's understandable to be a bit upset or have cloudy feelings, but rather than saying sad that you can't be there yourself, try to be thankful that there are still other ways to experience things and enjoy the moment together.

00:28:26.778 --> 00:28:32.702
You know, don't let it ruin something that could otherwise be so much fun and amazing.

00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:37.365
Just because you can't enjoy it 100% doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy it 80%.

00:28:39.603 --> 00:28:43.366
So, you know, let's all have fun together, okay?

00:28:44.127 --> 00:28:49.792
Because, you know, we're always thinking about you, no matter where you are.

00:28:50.773 --> 00:28:55.477
We're going to have so much fun all together this weekend, okay?

00:28:56.037 --> 00:29:01.502
So keep doing your best and stay safe as we break the dimensions!

00:29:01.982 --> 00:29:03.283
Ganbatte ne!

00:29:06.343 --> 00:29:07.684
Thank you, Moco-chan.

00:29:08.064 --> 00:29:11.707
That was a very nice pup talk, huh?

00:29:11.927 --> 00:29:14.649
That was a clip of you.

00:29:15.209 --> 00:29:17.191
I'm Mococo!

00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:19.092
That was a clip.

00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:22.755
I'm Fuwawa!

00:29:24.856 --> 00:29:25.357
Oh boy.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.780
Well, should we move on to our story of the day?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.141
BAU BAU!

00:29:32.512 --> 00:29:38.058
Well, our Doggie of the Day for today is... De-den!

00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:55.586
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Katie!

00:30:55.647 --> 00:30:56.147
Katie!

00:30:56.227 --> 00:30:57.708
BAU BAU!

00:30:57.748 --> 00:31:00.430
We're a little shy!

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:04.914
She looks tiny, but she barks loudly!

00:31:05.034 --> 00:31:06.936
Don't underestimate her, okay?

00:31:07.476 --> 00:31:10.178
I'm not going, no.

00:31:10.238 --> 00:31:10.318
Yeah.

00:31:10.539 --> 00:31:12.660
Moco-chan, how does Katie BAU BAU?

00:31:14.622 --> 00:31:16.063
BAU BAU!

00:31:16.423 --> 00:31:16.884
It does.

00:31:16.904 --> 00:31:17.764
BAU BAU!

00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:19.085
It's pretty noisy, really.

00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:20.206
BAU BAU!

00:31:20.446 --> 00:31:20.787
Huh?

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:29.316
Well, kitty, you know, she looks super sweet, but she's a strong girl dog just like FUWAMOCO!

00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:30.978
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:31.038 --> 00:31:33.059
Man, nobody stands in her way.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.422
Except for, uh, silly bugs when they get in the house.

00:31:37.243 --> 00:31:38.124
BAU BAU.

00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:39.925
BAU BAU!

00:31:40.005 --> 00:31:41.547
BAU BAU!

00:31:41.687 --> 00:31:42.127
Huh.

00:31:43.108 --> 00:31:48.072
And next... FUWAMOCO we go on a walk!

00:31:48.713 --> 00:31:48.933
Huh?

00:31:50.523 --> 00:31:52.305
For today, I went on a walk.

00:31:53.306 --> 00:31:55.469
Oh, where do we go, Ruffians?

00:31:57.391 --> 00:31:59.273
De-den!

00:32:03.297 --> 00:32:03.458
Oh!

00:32:14.483 --> 00:32:16.287
We went on a nice camping trip!

00:32:16.308 --> 00:32:16.909
FUWAMOCO!

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.859
We're so happy that you were able to disconnect.

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:34.643
Have a little bit and enjoy some time with your family.

00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:38.385
Especially, you know, with your little cousin there too.

00:32:38.405 --> 00:32:40.065
Yeah, that must have been so nice.

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:44.527
Wish it was such a very special first camping trip for them.

00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:44.607
Huh?

00:32:45.427 --> 00:32:46.928
BAU BAU!

00:32:47.008 --> 00:32:47.408
BAU BAU!

00:32:48.828 --> 00:32:57.151
And... For the Question of the Day... De-den!

00:32:57.251 --> 00:32:58.192
De-den!

00:33:00.614 --> 00:33:02.175
Ah, today's Question of the Day.

00:33:02.776 --> 00:33:03.837
Hey FUWAMOCO!

00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:05.499
BAU BAU!

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:09.142
Many Ruffians will be streaming Breaking Dimensions at home.

00:33:10.163 --> 00:33:12.526
How would you watch it if you were in their shoes?

00:33:12.926 --> 00:33:16.069
Sitting in a comfy chair with lots of tasty snacks?

00:33:16.429 --> 00:33:19.613
Or singing along and dancing and jumping around with penlights?

00:33:19.893 --> 00:33:21.675
BAU BAU!

00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:23.677
Ruffians!

00:33:25.318 --> 00:33:30.744
The best way is to watch it however you feel is the most fun to you!

00:33:30.764 --> 00:33:33.306
Definitely right, FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:33:33.326 --> 00:33:34.027
Yeah.

00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:37.330
Yeah, maybe with snacks or pamlets or friends.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.952
Make sure you eat a lot of snacks.

00:33:39.512 --> 00:33:45.656
Yeah, we definitely enjoyed dancing and singing and waving penlights around the best bar!

00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:47.137
Right, Fuwawa?

00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:49.739
So many times we've done that!

00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:56.243
Yeah, lots of memories waving the penlights and crying to idol concert DVDs!

00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:59.005
What's important is that you have fun yourself.

00:33:59.645 --> 00:34:01.767
Got it, Ruffians?

00:34:01.787 --> 00:34:03.007
Huh?

00:34:03.528 --> 00:34:03.948
Got it.

00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:06.590
BAU BAU!

00:34:09.815 --> 00:34:13.998
Ruffians, thank you so much for all of your submissions!

00:34:14.538 --> 00:34:19.141
Remember, FUWAMOCO Morning is something that we make all together!

00:34:19.882 --> 00:34:30.028
So we're always looking forward to more doggy of a days, to seeing your walks, and your questions, and you know, Pero Sightings even if they're really nasty.

00:34:30.648 --> 00:34:35.855
Okay, or even the brand new, recently discovered FUWAMOCO school!

00:34:36.275 --> 00:34:38.998
Okay, it's been helping us lots, K-Ruffians!

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.800
Don't forget the hashtag!

00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:42.102

00:34:51.882 --> 00:34:54.943
Well, we have another stream coming up, right?

00:34:55.244 --> 00:34:55.484
Yes!

00:34:55.564 --> 00:34:57.184
Yes, Moco-chan, we do!

00:34:57.925 --> 00:34:59.025
What's our next stream?

00:34:59.545 --> 00:35:00.166
De-den!

00:35:01.346 --> 00:35:03.007
It's not really a stream.

00:35:04.548 --> 00:35:05.828
Cheering Space!

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.850
No more streams for this week.

00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:13.252
No more FUWAMOCO Mornings for this week.

00:35:14.132 --> 00:35:15.673
Just breaking dimensions!

00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:18.592
Yeah, Ruffians!

00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:20.533
Why are you so quiet, FUWAMOCO-chan?

00:35:20.613 --> 00:35:21.874
Are you laughing at me?

00:35:22.214 --> 00:35:23.174
I'm not laughing!

00:35:23.574 --> 00:35:25.135
I'm Mococo!

00:35:25.755 --> 00:35:29.357
But you can cheer for us at the cheering space, okay, Ruffians?

00:35:29.397 --> 00:35:29.857
Okay!

00:35:30.217 --> 00:35:30.677
Yeah!

00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:32.658
That would make us happy, huh?

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.621
Do we need to look at the schedule, FUWAMOCO?

00:35:40.961 --> 00:35:43.282
Just in case you didn't know, Breaking Dimensions

00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:45.349
