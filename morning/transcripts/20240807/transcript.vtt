06:30.877 --> 06:36.001
BAU BAU!

06:36.081 --> 06:36.582
Why?

06:36.982 --> 06:39.665
Why is the background like this right now?

06:41.760 --> 06:44.902
We've been working all day long, Ruffians!

06:45.282 --> 06:46.142
BAU BAU!

06:47.203 --> 06:47.923
All right!

BAU BAU!

06:50.645 --> 06:51.285
BAU BAU!

06:52.065 --> 06:54.807
Wow, the barkers had a lot of time to warm up.

06:55.247 --> 06:58.188
But Ruffians, maybe you know you're just waking up.

06:58.228 --> 06:58.428
Yeah!

06:58.469 --> 07:00.570
So now it's time for you to wake up!

07:00.630 --> 07:00.910
Okay!

07:00.950 --> 07:01.390
Okay!

07:01.530 --> 07:02.250
BAU BAU!

07:02.310 --> 07:04.492
BAU BAU!

07:06.610 --> 07:09.152
It's just the way morning today!

07:09.532 --> 07:12.174
Maybe that's the proper way to start the day today, huh?

07:12.294 --> 07:12.695
Maybe it is!

07:12.715 --> 07:14.276
It's the right paw, huh?

07:14.856 --> 07:17.118
But what does the right paw mean?

07:17.318 --> 07:21.441
Ruffians who are just joining us for the first time today!

07:21.901 --> 07:28.006
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

07:28.226 --> 07:29.747

07:49.925 --> 07:52.507
BAU BAU!

07:52.807 --> 07:53.328
It's a bit better.

07:53.728 --> 07:59.212
Sometimes you know things are just a little bit funny, huh?

07:59.232 --> 08:00.834
A little bit funny, huh?

08:02.935 --> 08:05.137
BAU BAU!

08:05.377 --> 08:10.601
We've reached the middle of our 3D week, Moco-chan!

08:10.621 --> 08:12.403
Oh my gosh.

08:13.403 --> 08:16.626
Only a couple days away, last one minute!

08:19.715 --> 08:20.636
Moco-chan.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.258
I think the Ruffians are awake.

08:24.298 --> 08:26.400
They don't need any more alarms, okay?

08:27.561 --> 08:29.082
Yeah, I'm alarmed.

08:29.902 --> 08:30.223
BAU BAU!

08:30.263 --> 08:33.525
Yeah, are you too?

08:33.585 --> 08:34.966
But let's see, you know.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.708
How are we gonna wake up today, huh?

08:38.669 --> 08:43.752
Why don't we start with... Another Pero Sighting.

08:43.772 --> 08:44.793
Popo?

08:44.913 --> 08:47.015
Let's see where he is.

08:55.289 --> 08:55.630
Again.

08:56.232 --> 08:56.874
BAU BAU!

08:58.157 --> 09:00.223
Well, it's okay I guess.

09:21.444 --> 09:22.525
Wait, wait, wait, let me check.

09:24.907 --> 09:26.688
Let me check, let me check, let me check, let me check.

09:26.728 --> 09:28.029
We need to confirm the news.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.330
I will confirm the news.

09:29.530 --> 09:30.891
Please wait momentarily.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.453

It's amazing, Ruffians!

10:05.943 --> 10:08.825
Congratulations, Nerissa!

10:08.885 --> 10:11.288
You're making a new culture!

10:11.988 --> 10:12.609
Yeah!

10:12.869 --> 10:14.691
And, in my feelings, it's an EP.

10:14.891 --> 10:17.333
It has four songs on it.

10:17.353 --> 10:17.994
Four songs!

10:18.955 --> 10:19.876
Say My Name.

10:20.796 --> 10:22.598
Sweetest Scarlet.

10:22.898 --> 10:25.561
In my feelings, the title song.

10:25.741 --> 10:26.722
And Shadows.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.398
Shatter.

10:29.438 --> 10:30.419
Not shadow.

10:30.479 --> 10:31.099
Love you.

10:31.139 --> 10:31.700
Shatter.

10:31.780 --> 10:32.020
Shatter.

10:32.040 --> 10:32.520
Shatter.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.440
Shatter.

10:33.540 --> 10:34.081
Not shadow.

10:34.521 --> 10:35.021
Not shadow.

10:35.041 --> 10:35.321
Shatter.

10:35.361 --> 10:35.742

10:36.402 --> 10:36.942

10:37.042 --> 10:37.863
Yeah!

10:37.883 --> 10:40.144
Yeah, four songs!

10:40.564 --> 10:41.324
Four songs!

10:41.384 --> 10:42.625
Four songs!

10:42.945 --> 10:43.105
Yes!

10:43.145 --> 10:43.485
Yeah!

10:43.705 --> 10:43.986
And...

10:47.087 --> 10:49.669
Well, maybe Ruffians, maybe FUWAMOCO.

10:49.709 --> 10:50.329
We can see it.

10:50.630 --> 11:00.896
We're lucky because, well, it launches on streaming services everywhere in your time zone at August 8th, midnight.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.558
The moment it turns August 8th.

11:02.598 --> 11:06.440
The moment it turns August 8th in your area, okay?

11:06.620 --> 11:11.143
So look forward to it if it hasn't quite become midnight where you are.

11:12.144 --> 11:12.704
Kota.

11:12.824 --> 11:13.744

11:37.769 --> 11:40.551
I wanna listen to it now!

11:40.611 --> 11:44.073
But we can't because we have FUWAMOCO Morning!

11:44.093 --> 11:45.074
It's okay.

11:45.114 --> 11:46.895
You know what we were thinking?

11:46.955 --> 11:50.697
Maybe we can make all the Ruffians wait so we can listen to it, but... No.

11:51.698 --> 11:53.859
That would be mean, right?

11:53.959 --> 11:54.940
Please enjoy!

11:55.380 --> 11:56.821
We definitely will.

11:57.501 --> 12:01.664
That's the first thing we're doing after FUWAMOCO Morning is over.

12:01.684 --> 12:03.225
We have something very exciting.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.369
Wow.

12:05.389 --> 12:07.630
And Ruffians, you have something exciting too!

12:07.690 --> 12:08.010
Yeah!

12:08.150 --> 12:08.390
But!

12:08.610 --> 12:08.970
But!

12:09.030 --> 12:11.751
You know, EP is pretty exciting.

12:12.351 --> 12:19.712
But also... Just as exciting is Nerissa's 3D debut!

12:19.752 --> 12:22.233
It's coming up so soon!

12:22.293 --> 12:27.274
It's gonna be happening on August 9th at 8pm PT.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.795
It says three days here, but pretty much like two days now.

12:34.183 --> 12:36.708
There's some, uh, feathers.

12:40.271 --> 12:42.812
A little bit fluffy around the arms there.

12:43.072 --> 12:44.032
Some stripes.

12:44.172 --> 12:45.132
Yeah.

12:46.012 --> 12:48.673
Shadows.

12:49.193 --> 12:56.295
Well, I think we'll be able to see Nerissa even better on August 9th, so please make sure that you do.

12:56.315 --> 12:59.196
Let's see her all lots and lots together with us.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.536
Okay, Ruffians!

13:01.256 --> 13:02.596
And then it's our turn.

13:02.876 --> 13:03.657
We're so nervous!

13:03.677 --> 13:04.097
BAU BAU!

13:04.137 --> 13:04.437
BAU BAU!

13:04.477 --> 13:06.017
Go get Nerissa!

13:10.359 --> 13:12.562
BAU BAU!

13:13.123 --> 13:14.304
Oh my gosh.

13:14.444 --> 13:15.285
I'm so excited.

13:15.306 --> 13:16.848
Yeah, you have it up, Ruffians.

13:16.888 --> 13:18.069
You can listen after.

13:18.169 --> 13:18.850
Or right now.

13:19.071 --> 13:19.772
Or right now.

13:19.892 --> 13:20.473
You know.

13:20.573 --> 13:23.997
But I think it'd be better for you to just get the nice headphone.

13:24.037 --> 13:24.498
You know.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.339
Take a moment.

13:25.399 --> 13:26.921
Listen to it deeply.

13:26.961 --> 13:27.182
Right.

13:28.653 --> 13:31.254
That's the way Nerissa would want you to listen to it.

13:31.274 --> 13:31.694
Actually, Moco-chan!

13:31.714 --> 13:34.175
Moco-chan, can I go get a cup of water right now?

13:34.535 --> 13:34.815
What?

13:35.395 --> 13:39.597
If I go get a cup of water, the barka will be even more rejuvenated.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.077
And so will my ears.

13:42.298 --> 13:42.678
Okay.

13:44.638 --> 13:46.919
Moco-chan, you know why I wanna go get a cup of water?

13:46.939 --> 13:48.560
Oh, for the water.

13:49.120 --> 13:49.200
Oh.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.861
I was confused.

13:53.121 --> 13:55.003
Why do you need your ears, huh?

13:55.183 --> 14:01.967
So I come and jubilate my ears with a nice fresh cup of Nerissa's EP!

14:02.468 --> 14:03.989
Yeah.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.650
Confusing me, huh?

14:05.670 --> 14:06.711
Right?

14:06.791 --> 14:08.812
And maybe the moment too.

14:08.832 --> 14:09.953
BAU BAU!

14:10.053 --> 14:12.294
BAU BAU!

14:12.975 --> 14:13.555
Yeah.

14:15.297 --> 14:16.277
Confused, huh?

14:16.457 --> 14:18.219
We'll listen after maybe.

14:18.259 --> 14:18.659
Maybe, yeah.

14:18.679 --> 14:19.619
Nerissa's EP?

14:22.104 --> 14:22.384
No.

14:23.444 --> 14:25.306
The real EP1 is... Mococo!

14:26.026 --> 14:27.947
Moco-chan.

14:28.647 --> 14:31.049
BAU BAU!

14:31.309 --> 14:33.991
Well, we have some very exciting news.

14:34.571 --> 14:39.374
But today we also have some lonely news as well.

14:40.334 --> 14:45.037
Our very precious senpai, Minato Akuma-senpai.

14:45.057 --> 14:50.100
She announced that she'll be graduating on the 28th of August this month.

14:51.758 --> 14:59.407
Ah, you know... It's really sad, you know, that she'll be leaving after six years of her whole life here.

14:59.948 --> 15:04.953
But she's been a huge pillar to all of us and an amazing inspiration too.

15:08.068 --> 15:08.448
Yeah.

15:09.249 --> 15:16.215
We really love how cute and healing and just talented and skilled it is, AquaSempire!

15:16.236 --> 15:16.296
Yes!

15:16.316 --> 15:19.919
We really love her music too!

15:19.979 --> 15:23.542
You know, she does lots and lots while we're in the cells.

15:23.602 --> 15:24.043
Yeah.

15:24.923 --> 15:28.725
And she also, you know, she's released a full visual novel too!

15:28.805 --> 15:31.727
That's one of our huge dreams!

15:32.427 --> 15:35.489
You know, and not to mention her solo lives too!

15:36.389 --> 15:39.631
So many amazing things Akko-senpai has done!

15:40.071 --> 15:46.054
You know, we really hope that even Akko-senpai has graduated, you know, that we can look

15:46.725 --> 15:53.067
Her and all her accomplishments were inspiration and strength and growth for me too.

15:53.647 --> 15:56.748
Thank you so much, Aqua-chan-pai!

15:57.168 --> 16:01.489
We'll cheer for you until your final graduation concert comes to a close.

16:02.289 --> 16:03.710
BAU BAU!

16:03.810 --> 16:09.131
Let's enjoy the time together, okay?

16:09.211 --> 16:10.892
BAU BAU!

16:11.692 --> 16:13.552
We know what's tough, what is important.

16:18.942 --> 16:20.524
Well, Ruffians.

16:21.165 --> 16:22.987
What we wanted to talk about today?

16:23.808 --> 16:24.208
August.

16:24.789 --> 16:27.812
August, you know there's a lot of things going on in August.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.956
A lot of goodbyes, but also summertime!

16:30.996 --> 16:31.756
It's summer!

16:31.917 --> 16:32.317
Yeah.

16:32.718 --> 16:33.579
Which means...

16:34.288 --> 16:35.269
Whole Summer.

16:35.289 --> 16:35.930
BINGO!

16:36.391 --> 16:38.153
BINGO!

16:38.253 --> 16:38.794
BINGO!

16:38.834 --> 16:39.154
Yes!

16:39.274 --> 16:39.795
Yeah!

16:39.815 --> 16:41.076
He's back.

16:41.277 --> 16:46.383
Yeah, this year the main event is this Whole Summer BINGO!

16:46.403 --> 16:47.224
BINGO!

16:47.324 --> 16:47.845
Yeah!

16:47.925 --> 16:48.445
Yeah!

16:48.485 --> 16:50.488
We love bingo, right Ruffians?

16:50.548 --> 16:51.309
Yeah!

16:51.389 --> 16:52.791
Especially when there's fun and

16:53.901 --> 16:54.461
Prizes.

16:54.701 --> 16:55.221
Prizes?

16:55.261 --> 16:55.822
Involved.

16:56.022 --> 16:56.962
Yeah!

16:57.422 --> 16:57.942
Wow.

16:58.382 --> 16:58.983
Ruffians!

16:59.023 --> 17:00.623
The rules are simple!

17:00.663 --> 17:00.943
Yeah.

17:01.263 --> 17:08.846
Ruffians, unfortunately, you can play along with us too, but I think it's more for the holo members than Ruffians, alright?

17:08.866 --> 17:10.126
You probably won't get a prize.

17:10.606 --> 17:13.607
We don't know what the prizes are yet, but we believe.

17:13.647 --> 17:15.888
Let's take a look at the bingo rules!

17:16.408 --> 17:17.729
Let's take a look at the rules.

17:17.789 --> 17:21.090
Cause, they were explained in Japanese.

17:23.787 --> 17:25.228
Visual stream the other day!

17:25.528 --> 17:29.231
But there wasn't too much of an explanation in English as to what the whole bingo is about.

17:29.351 --> 17:30.372
So we're gonna explain it!

17:30.392 --> 17:33.214
So the whole summer bingo rules!

17:33.314 --> 17:35.436
So there's a bingo card next to you.

17:35.496 --> 17:36.036
We'll show you!

17:36.096 --> 17:36.777
Bingo card!

17:36.797 --> 17:41.240
And you fill the missions the square is in by completing the missions.

17:41.260 --> 17:41.600
Yeah!

17:41.700 --> 17:42.241
It's a bingo.

17:42.401 --> 17:44.682
And you get one point for each bingo.

17:45.143 --> 17:49.166
And you have from August 3rd until August 31st.

17:49.506 --> 17:50.467
You have as in us.

17:50.607 --> 17:50.727
Us.

17:52.708 --> 17:53.768
To complete it!

17:54.109 --> 17:59.010
And you can clear, as a FUWAMOCO, the missions in any way you'd like, you know?

17:59.030 --> 18:07.853
So if you eat a watermelon, you can do a watermelon eating stream, eat a watermelon in a game, take a picture of a half-eaten watermelon.

18:08.273 --> 18:09.394
It's not that tricky.

18:09.474 --> 18:10.754
Not that complicated.

18:11.034 --> 18:12.575
Not that intense.

18:12.835 --> 18:14.435
But, uh, I say that now.

18:14.575 --> 18:16.156
But let's take a look, you know?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.316
Take a look at the PC.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.457
Let's have fun.

18:18.517 --> 18:18.877
Have fun.

18:20.056 --> 18:21.737
This is the main bingo.

18:21.957 --> 18:23.897
It's a bit hard to read, so we'll read it out.

18:24.018 --> 18:24.758
Bento!

18:24.838 --> 18:26.138
Bento!

18:26.498 --> 18:27.319
Eat a bento.

18:27.379 --> 18:28.559
Have a bento.

18:28.819 --> 18:30.960
Encounter a bento.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.421
Play sports.

18:32.801 --> 18:33.361
Play a sport?

18:34.121 --> 18:34.461
Easy!

18:35.262 --> 18:38.203
Next one is Summer Test of Courage, which might be confusing.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.204
Something scary has to happen.

18:41.224 --> 18:42.864
You have to test your courage.

18:43.484 --> 18:44.684
And learn a new skill.

18:44.804 --> 18:45.764
Learn a new skill.

18:46.225 --> 18:46.985
Learn a new skill?

18:47.105 --> 18:47.545
Anything.

18:48.065 --> 18:53.206
I was thinking that I would like to try and see how far I can kick a shoe off my foot.

18:54.726 --> 18:55.146
That!

18:56.267 --> 18:59.247
I don't want to hit anyone, but that's learning a new skill, right?

19:00.228 --> 19:01.348
Is it a skill?

19:02.408 --> 19:03.108
What a skill.

19:03.308 --> 19:03.808
Yeah.

19:04.048 --> 19:05.669
Write a poetic verse.

19:06.709 --> 19:06.829
Yeah.

19:07.773 --> 19:07.994
Easy.

19:08.414 --> 19:08.954
Flyin' from the sky.

19:09.034 --> 19:09.795
Play a retro game.

19:11.176 --> 19:11.537
Done.

19:11.577 --> 19:11.877
Done.

19:12.417 --> 19:12.798
Done!

19:12.878 --> 19:13.679
We won!

19:13.799 --> 19:17.182
We just, we said there was five yesterday!

19:17.562 --> 19:20.164
And unfortunately that counts as a retro game.

19:20.224 --> 19:21.405
It's a PS2 game!

19:21.505 --> 19:23.507
I don't wanna say it's a retro game!

19:23.527 --> 19:25.209
There's PS5 now.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.034
I don't wanna count.

19:31.354 --> 19:32.155
I don't want it to count.

19:33.595 --> 19:35.437
PS5 exists.

19:36.038 --> 19:39.202
Talk about some men of his own.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.505
Conduct an experiment.

19:44.581 --> 19:45.422
On the Ruffians.

19:45.982 --> 19:47.163
On the Ruffians.

19:47.703 --> 19:48.803
Moco-chan.

19:50.564 --> 19:50.785
Well.

19:50.865 --> 19:52.786
Organizing events.

19:53.386 --> 19:57.128
It's something you've never tried before.

19:57.769 --> 19:59.530
Conducting investigation.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.291
On the Ruffians.

20:01.311 --> 20:04.072
How is it different from experiment?

20:04.492 --> 20:05.513
Experiment is different.

20:05.533 --> 20:06.714
It's trying something.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.055
Okay.

20:08.135 --> 20:09.035
Investigation.

20:09.155 --> 20:10.096
Serious business.

20:10.116 --> 20:10.216
Okay.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.041
Back again!

20:12.221 --> 20:16.525
Memorize all 47 prefectures of Japan!

20:16.685 --> 20:23.111
Could that have anything to do with... I wonder.

20:23.132 --> 20:25.794
We might be doing a stream kinda like that one.

20:26.054 --> 20:27.776
And then there's the free space!

20:27.816 --> 20:28.977
Your summer goals!

20:29.017 --> 20:30.439
FUWAMOCO Abyssgard.

20:33.543 --> 20:34.884
Next is watch a movie!

20:34.924 --> 20:38.125
Moco-chan, you're supposed to fill it with your summer goals!

20:38.785 --> 20:39.866
Watch a movie!

20:41.387 --> 20:42.767
Yeah, it's too difficult.

20:44.388 --> 20:46.409
Start a picture diary.

20:47.710 --> 20:48.250
Eniki.

20:48.570 --> 20:49.050
Bijou.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.191
Do a leisure activity.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.432
This is a hard one.

20:53.592 --> 20:55.273
What's a leisure activity?

20:57.022 --> 20:57.502
We'll see!

20:58.463 --> 21:00.785
Catch insects or fish.

21:00.985 --> 21:02.467
I want to do both!

21:03.047 --> 21:05.009
I keep on looking around everywhere.

21:05.069 --> 21:06.710
Is there a cicada I can catch?

21:06.750 --> 21:09.973
She keeps on telling me, Moco-chan, we have to catch some insects.

21:11.554 --> 21:12.215
Okay!

21:12.415 --> 21:13.095
Okay!

21:13.216 --> 21:14.837
Next is treat your parents.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.000
Very important.

21:18.780 --> 21:20.101
After that, have a collab.

21:21.623 --> 21:21.863
Done?

21:24.373 --> 21:25.634
Ruffians!

21:25.714 --> 21:26.335
Ruffians!

21:26.375 --> 21:28.677
Does this count as a collab right now?

21:28.697 --> 21:31.519
Technically, yes.

21:36.143 --> 21:36.443
Yes?

21:37.444 --> 21:37.805
No?

21:38.005 --> 21:38.465
No!

21:38.906 --> 21:39.346
No!

21:39.446 --> 21:40.227
What?

21:40.527 --> 21:40.967
What?

21:41.868 --> 21:42.349
What?

21:43.189 --> 21:44.170
Doesn't count!

21:47.373 --> 21:48.814
We'll see, okay?

21:49.395 --> 21:50.315
Fan service.

21:51.677 --> 21:51.917
Skip.

21:52.851 --> 21:58.034
Sing a summery song!

21:58.254 --> 21:58.535
What?

21:58.815 --> 21:59.695
Scaming off!

21:59.795 --> 22:00.396
Okay, done.

22:00.756 --> 22:02.097
Confess your sins.

22:02.837 --> 22:04.518
Skip the fanservice one.

22:05.159 --> 22:06.239
Write a letter!

22:07.880 --> 22:09.942
Okay, we write letters all the time.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.003
Give a gift?

22:12.023 --> 22:12.503
Okay.

22:12.643 --> 22:14.384
Find or show a treasure.

22:15.685 --> 22:16.506
Pretty simple.

22:17.026 --> 22:18.427
We're working on it.

22:18.447 --> 22:19.408
Already got some done!

22:19.668 --> 22:19.828
Yeah.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.373
But you know, this is the Holo Summer Bingo.

22:23.413 --> 22:25.793
But this is not just the only one.

22:26.073 --> 22:29.654
There is Inferno Bingo.

22:29.834 --> 22:30.414
Inferno.

22:30.794 --> 22:32.754
So what is Inferno Bingo?

22:32.854 --> 22:35.035
Inferno Bingo is new!

22:35.395 --> 22:40.836
We have a bunch of very infernal, difficult tasks here.

22:40.916 --> 22:44.317
And these ones are actually determined by us Holo members!

22:44.377 --> 22:45.097
Yeah!

22:45.137 --> 22:46.757
Yeah, we all suggested a bunch!

22:46.997 --> 22:48.418
FUWAMOCO!

22:48.498 --> 22:49.498
They suggested...

22:50.685 --> 22:51.486
Wash a dog.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.206
Yeah.

22:52.406 --> 22:54.187
And bungee jumping!

22:54.988 --> 22:55.948
But we don't remember.

22:55.968 --> 22:56.889
We didn't get told.

22:57.629 --> 22:57.930
Yeah.

22:58.230 --> 22:59.851
We didn't remember suggesting them.

22:59.891 --> 23:01.091
What did we suggest?

23:01.172 --> 23:04.033
And they were like... Oh my god!

23:04.353 --> 23:05.294
That's right!

23:05.374 --> 23:06.575
Yeah, so we were like, oh!

23:06.855 --> 23:08.496
What did Fuwamoco suggest?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.337
I can't remember anymore.

23:10.938 --> 23:12.599
Wash a dog would've been nice, huh?

23:12.639 --> 23:15.801
Moco-chan, I could've just gotten you into the bathtub and... Check!

23:16.361 --> 23:16.761
Right.

23:17.401 --> 23:18.962
Twitter space in the bathtub.

23:19.223 --> 23:19.463
Done!

23:21.600 --> 23:21.820
Well.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.021
Missed opportunity.

23:23.081 --> 23:24.422
Can't do that anymore.

23:24.642 --> 23:24.922
No.

23:25.082 --> 23:25.683
Yeah.

23:25.863 --> 23:26.043
No.

23:26.483 --> 23:35.229
But the good thing about Inferno Bingo is that one bingo counts for three times the points of a regular one.

23:35.850 --> 23:36.410
Yeah.

23:37.451 --> 23:37.751
So.

23:38.992 --> 23:40.172
Inferno Bingo, good.

23:40.213 --> 23:46.197
But we have two waiting for call streams, like a call-in stream with a set theme.

23:49.890 --> 23:51.571
Lots of ideas.

23:51.871 --> 23:56.453
And then we have sent a long message of love to a hololive member.

23:56.513 --> 23:59.355
To be honest, I feel like we sort of do this often.

24:02.496 --> 24:06.218
Create a new unit.

24:06.418 --> 24:06.858
Ideas.

24:07.498 --> 24:09.819
Successfully pull off a prank.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.341
We can do that.

24:12.361 --> 24:12.921
We can do that.

24:14.128 --> 24:14.488
Advent.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.129
We're innocent, though.

24:16.810 --> 24:17.631
Yeah.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.473
Feel free to decide for yourself.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.653
Free space.

24:22.094 --> 24:22.534
Anything.

24:23.275 --> 24:23.675
Yeah.

24:24.235 --> 24:27.137
Collab with members I don't usually interact with.

24:27.377 --> 24:33.121
Unfortunately, that's... We've only been around for one year.

24:33.622 --> 24:40.347
There's a lot of senpai we haven't collabed with, so... Unfortunately, this one's not too tricky, right?

24:42.067 --> 24:45.628
Do a stream of impersonating other hololive members!

24:46.788 --> 24:49.908
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

24:49.988 --> 24:51.229
Can't you say it in your voice?

24:51.349 --> 24:52.489
I can't, I can't.

24:52.909 --> 24:53.409
I can.

24:54.309 --> 25:02.190
Make Italian food.

25:02.911 --> 25:03.651
Last one!

25:04.571 --> 25:06.311
Try eating insects.

25:06.451 --> 25:09.192
Why do they say try, not just eat insects?

25:09.212 --> 25:11.332
Wait, so we have to catch insects.

25:12.037 --> 25:13.278
And then we have to eat.

25:14.379 --> 25:14.939
Oh!

25:14.959 --> 25:17.160
Oh!

25:18.101 --> 25:18.561
We'll see.

25:18.581 --> 25:20.583
I wonder what we'll find.

25:21.143 --> 25:22.724
What will the harvest be like?

25:24.405 --> 25:30.269
Well, like we said, our goal is to get every single one of them done.

25:30.609 --> 25:36.373
They now have completely cleared both the normal bingo and the infernal bingo.

25:37.852 --> 25:40.814
And that both of us, you know, FUWAMA complete!

25:40.995 --> 25:42.135
Moco-chan complete!

25:42.155 --> 25:42.776
Exactly!

25:43.977 --> 25:46.879
So that's a lot of fun to be half Ruffians!

25:47.259 --> 25:51.462
But like the rules said, it goes up until August 31st.

25:52.122 --> 26:00.488
Which means, really, we only have half of the month to do this before breaking the mansion.

26:01.068 --> 26:01.288
Yeah...

26:04.212 --> 26:08.093
We're gonna do our best for FUWAMOCO!

26:08.293 --> 26:14.554
One thing for sure is... We're gonna have a lot of fun together with you!

26:14.754 --> 26:17.235
BAU BAU!

26:17.315 --> 26:18.895
Let's see which one we get complete.

26:19.055 --> 26:19.375
Yeah.

26:19.955 --> 26:20.635
We'll see.

26:20.916 --> 26:21.396
BAU BAU!

26:21.416 --> 26:26.317
We'll update it on Twitter, okay?

26:26.657 --> 26:29.657
Also on the community page where we get big updates.

26:29.997 --> 26:30.738
Yeah.

26:31.278 --> 26:31.918
Full bingo.

26:32.178 --> 26:32.358
Yeah.

26:33.327 --> 26:35.229
BAU BAU!

26:35.249 --> 26:38.353
And that's the hololive summer bingo!

26:38.573 --> 26:39.674
You understand the bingo?

26:39.754 --> 26:40.715
It's not that tricky.

26:40.795 --> 26:42.217
It's not that tricky.

26:42.597 --> 26:45.060
I think Beii-senpai is doing it.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.082
Beii-senpai won last year though.

26:47.223 --> 26:47.743
Right?

26:49.345 --> 26:50.586
How do we beat her, Moco-chan?

26:50.606 --> 26:51.708
I don't know.

26:51.928 --> 26:53.089
Could I have the bingo?

26:54.303 --> 26:55.384
We'll have to do our best!

26:55.724 --> 26:56.364
BAU BAU!

26:56.684 --> 26:57.825
BAU BAU!

26:57.925 --> 26:58.926
You understand?

26:58.966 --> 27:00.126
Does it have to be all on stream?

27:00.226 --> 27:00.647
It doesn't!

27:00.727 --> 27:01.027
It doesn't.

27:01.067 --> 27:01.667
Necessarily.

27:01.727 --> 27:02.007
No.

27:02.307 --> 27:05.129
You can upload like a photo, like a set of watermelons.

27:05.149 --> 27:05.269
Yeah!

27:05.429 --> 27:08.211
To Twitter, so like, or do it in a game.

27:08.411 --> 27:16.475
So like Italian food, technically you can make the Italian food off stream, take a photo of it, and then be like, I made Italian food!

27:16.575 --> 27:17.076
Yeah!

27:17.116 --> 27:18.216
And that's clear, right?

27:18.236 --> 27:18.517
Clear.

27:19.017 --> 27:19.397
Done.

27:19.677 --> 27:20.037
I know.

27:21.441 --> 27:23.002
I think it depends on everybody.

27:23.022 --> 27:24.143
What's possible for them?

27:24.163 --> 27:24.904
Games do count!

27:24.964 --> 27:26.465
It says eat a watermelon.

27:26.785 --> 27:28.847
And it says you can eat a watermelon in a game.

27:29.307 --> 27:34.572
I'm smoking some heroin.

27:36.433 --> 27:37.794
Make it off-collab with Daora.

27:38.275 --> 27:45.000
But what if Daora ends up having just off-collab months when she only makes Italian food with all the food?

27:45.180 --> 27:45.681
Right!

27:45.701 --> 27:45.761
Wow.

27:47.898 --> 27:48.799
She'll be a chef.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.021
Chef daora.

27:50.061 --> 27:50.301
Yeah!

27:50.561 --> 27:51.202
Alright.

27:51.602 --> 27:53.665
Doyoshi!

27:53.705 --> 27:54.946
BAU BAU!

27:55.367 --> 27:57.729
BAU BAU!

27:57.749 --> 28:00.533
There's a lot to look forward to!

28:01.254 --> 28:03.376
But, it's the middle of the week.

28:03.476 --> 28:04.898
You know, it's...

28:05.358 --> 28:09.301
Summertime is hotter, you know, maybe you're feeling a little bit beaten down.

28:09.361 --> 28:11.222
Or a little bit drained.

28:11.482 --> 28:11.842
Yeah.

28:12.283 --> 28:12.543
Huh?

28:13.103 --> 28:13.984
Moco-chan.

28:14.084 --> 28:14.324
Huh?

28:14.584 --> 28:18.907
Do you have anything to bring us back up to full energy, full power?

28:23.636 --> 28:25.037
BAU BAU!

28:25.857 --> 28:26.877
Ruffians!

28:27.878 --> 28:29.598
It's that day of the week!

28:30.298 --> 28:34.580
It's time for another one of my Mococo Pup Talks!

28:35.400 --> 28:37.481
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

28:38.021 --> 28:39.021
Mococo!

28:41.842 --> 28:42.463
Ruffians.

28:44.043 --> 28:46.664
Has it been a little bit rough recently?

28:47.745 --> 28:48.025
No.

28:48.705 --> 28:51.426
Maybe you're feeling a bit more emotional than usual.

28:52.563 --> 28:54.504
And it's okay to feel like that, Ruffians.

28:55.325 --> 28:59.327
It's perfectly normal and understandable, so don't beat yourself up for that.

29:00.327 --> 29:06.431
It's important to remember that nothing in life is permanent, and that's exactly why things are special to us.

29:07.111 --> 29:09.873
You know, just like a sunny day or blooming flowers.

29:11.213 --> 29:17.457
Don't be sad for what you've lost, but be happy for the good times that we've had, for all the memories that were made,

29:19.132 --> 29:26.695
Please remember that even though things might not be as they were, that there are good times ahead of you for sure.

29:27.335 --> 29:27.695
Okay?

29:28.436 --> 29:29.196
I can promise that.

29:30.637 --> 29:31.777
You just might not know yet.

29:33.078 --> 29:34.998
And it's fine to be sad for now.

29:35.579 --> 29:36.559
You can take that time.

29:37.639 --> 29:44.122
But make sure to notice all the happy things going on around you during that time as well, so you don't miss them.

29:44.802 --> 29:47.824
And continue to make good memories during this time too.

29:49.277 --> 29:51.924
Remember, we're all here to support each other.

29:52.425 --> 29:52.886
Got it?

29:53.949 --> 29:55.553
Ganbatte ne!

29:55.793 --> 29:57.297
BAU BAU!

29:59.702 --> 30:01.984
BAU BAU!

30:02.144 --> 30:07.767
Let's do our best to keep our feelings.

30:08.047 --> 30:09.888
I know what I feel like right now.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.790
I feel like I could be the Doggie of the Day after that.

30:13.230 --> 30:13.810
But I'm not.

30:14.111 --> 30:17.613
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day is today!

30:17.793 --> 30:20.594
The Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

30:20.854 --> 30:22.375
It's Kobe!

30:22.455 --> 30:22.856
Kobe!

30:25.377 --> 30:28.418
Such a sweet, quirky... Look at that tongue!

30:28.598 --> 30:30.719
That is the tongue.

30:30.779 --> 30:33.120
Bubblegum tongue.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.481
Look at the... The cheeks?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.141
Eyebrows!

30:36.201 --> 30:38.042
But he has the... The fluffy cheeks!

30:38.162 --> 30:39.562
I just love the muscles!

30:39.582 --> 30:40.803
I do like the eyebrows.

30:40.823 --> 30:43.264
They look like coal mines.

30:43.284 --> 30:47.946
A coal mine is silly, but it has a heart of gold!

30:47.986 --> 30:48.926
I can see it!

30:49.066 --> 30:51.447
I can see how shining that heart is!

30:52.308 --> 30:53.089
Cute!

30:53.991 --> 30:54.812
How does it call me?

30:54.852 --> 30:55.734
BAU-BAU!

30:56.255 --> 30:56.876
Thank you, Sora.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.160
Sora is silly, but Sora is sweet!

31:00.202 --> 31:01.063
BAU-BAU!

31:01.324 --> 31:01.824
BAU-BAU!

31:04.965 --> 31:05.905
I love it!

31:05.985 --> 31:08.266
A fatal attitude!

31:08.406 --> 31:09.266
Yeah!

31:09.286 --> 31:10.407
BAU BAU!

31:10.507 --> 31:12.948
BAU BAU!

31:12.968 --> 31:14.148
Kobe!

31:14.208 --> 31:17.769
Kobe is just about the bestest boy ever!

31:17.809 --> 31:18.269
Just about.

31:18.749 --> 31:20.250
Amazing smile!

31:20.270 --> 31:22.190
Loves you no matter what!

31:22.250 --> 31:23.791
Even if you don't have any traits.

31:29.677 --> 31:30.618
Shiori too!

31:30.638 --> 31:31.399
Shiori!

31:31.419 --> 31:32.240
BAU BAU!

31:32.420 --> 31:34.983
BAU BAU!

31:35.003 --> 31:35.643
I love the cheeks.

31:35.683 --> 31:37.065
My ears are so big now.

31:37.245 --> 31:38.026
BAU BAU!

31:38.126 --> 31:38.346
And next!

31:44.823 --> 31:48.425
Ruffians, have you been having some summer adventures?

31:48.646 --> 31:50.807
Let's take a look at where you've been at!

31:51.207 --> 31:53.069
Today, I went on a walk!

31:53.409 --> 31:56.151
We have... De-den!

31:56.431 --> 31:56.631
Oh!

31:57.532 --> 31:59.313
Malfuji!

31:59.513 --> 32:01.755
Wait, you climbed on Malfuji!

32:02.035 --> 32:04.196
Together with a Ruffian buddy too!

32:04.236 --> 32:05.297
Yeah!

32:05.537 --> 32:07.158
That makes us so happy!

32:07.238 --> 32:08.259
Yeah!

32:08.319 --> 32:09.860
Wow wow!

32:09.940 --> 32:12.442
Not just that, you took us for the climb too!

32:12.462 --> 32:12.662
Right!

32:12.722 --> 32:13.603
All together!

32:16.024 --> 32:17.886
Thank you!

32:18.086 --> 32:20.828
One of our dreams came true then!

32:21.228 --> 32:25.712
We'd really love to climb Mount Fuji ourselves one day too!

32:26.152 --> 32:27.513
BAU BAU!

32:27.533 --> 32:29.575
Make sure you get a lot of rest okay!

32:29.615 --> 32:30.976
Rest, rest, rest, rest!

32:31.116 --> 32:34.219
BAU BAU!

32:34.799 --> 32:35.840
Amazing.

32:35.860 --> 32:39.082
You have to be careful on those kind of trips though too.

32:39.202 --> 32:39.623
Safety.

32:41.202 --> 32:41.863
BAU BAU!

32:41.963 --> 32:42.964
BAU BAU!

32:43.424 --> 32:43.884
And next!

32:43.904 --> 32:45.686
Moco-chan, did we get a question?

32:45.726 --> 32:51.250
For the Question of the Day, we have... DE-DEN!

32:51.651 --> 32:54.113
Well, I know Pero is nasty.

32:54.693 --> 32:55.274
Nasty.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.635
But his birthday is coming up.

32:58.056 --> 33:02.459
So, question other than putting, what would Pero like for a present?

33:02.579 --> 33:04.961
Has Fuwamoco got him a present?

33:08.313 --> 33:10.195
Did we forget his birthday last year?

33:10.795 --> 33:12.136
He doesn't hold grudges.

33:12.737 --> 33:14.759
Why?

33:16.901 --> 33:17.781
Grudges, maybe.

33:18.842 --> 33:19.243
We'll see.

33:20.244 --> 33:27.550
But you know, I think Pero, what he wants more is for people to know that he exists, you know?

33:28.291 --> 33:30.012
He's been missing for so long.

33:30.513 --> 33:34.957
So, uh, maybe he's got a bit self-conscious about that.

33:35.902 --> 33:39.224
That's just my guess though, okay?

33:39.264 --> 33:42.405
But for gifts other than pudding!

33:45.546 --> 33:49.988
Why not get him some clothing or accessories or something?

33:50.048 --> 33:53.090
I hope I don't have to wear this big thing!

33:53.210 --> 33:56.191
I'm sure he would love that!

33:56.691 --> 33:57.972
Pero would love that.

33:58.032 --> 33:59.153
Pero would love that.

34:01.722 --> 34:01.822
Oh!

34:02.182 --> 34:02.842
A bikini.

34:02.882 --> 34:03.683
A bunch of steaks?

34:03.743 --> 34:04.863
Can you wear those steaks though?

34:04.883 --> 34:06.303
A big bow-tie of steak.

34:07.083 --> 34:07.363
What?

34:08.464 --> 34:10.024
Hamburgers!

34:11.865 --> 34:13.865
I thought we were talking about clothing.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.145
Is he gonna wear steaks?

34:15.165 --> 34:17.246
I don't know.

34:17.266 --> 34:22.647
But you know, Ruffians, more than anything, it's the thought that counts, right?

34:23.047 --> 34:24.528
So don't worry about him.

34:25.928 --> 34:26.928
Yeah, the thought.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.589
You know, like, if you don't think of anything,

34:34.818 --> 34:45.964
That means the most.

34:45.984 --> 34:46.044
Huh?

34:46.064 --> 34:48.005
This Pero's nasty.

34:48.025 --> 34:48.345
BAU BAU!

34:48.385 --> 34:49.145
BAU BAU!

34:49.566 --> 34:50.046
Yeah.

34:50.146 --> 34:52.747
But let's forget about that!

34:53.087 --> 34:56.429
I wanna say a big thank you to all the Mofins!

34:56.809 --> 35:01.472
Thank you for always being a huge part of FUWAMOCO Morning here with us!

35:02.192 --> 35:09.577
Please remember, if you have a question, if you know you wanna show the world just how cute your dog is, it's gonna be the dog of the day.

35:09.797 --> 35:10.938
Your amazing walk.

35:11.939 --> 35:16.882
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

35:16.982 --> 35:17.403
Got it!

35:17.523 --> 35:17.943
BAU BAU!

35:18.603 --> 35:20.244
Bye bye!

35:20.464 --> 35:23.386
And for our next stream, we have de-den!

35:23.666 --> 35:24.807

35:24.867 --> 35:26.668
Our first time!

35:26.908 --> 35:28.048
Finally!

35:28.088 --> 35:28.769
Finally!

35:28.909 --> 35:29.829
Finally!

35:30.230 --> 35:33.511
It's a co-op game, that means we have to cooperate.

35:33.531 --> 35:37.594
Hopefully that will go well because I heard there's a lot of hard puzzles.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.311
We'll see how this goes.

35:41.491 --> 35:42.052
Yeah!

35:42.072 --> 35:42.452
Yeah!

35:43.193 --> 35:43.473
BAU BAU!

35:43.573 --> 35:50.059
I don't know if we take a look at our schedule.

35:50.239 --> 35:50.479
Yeah!

35:50.540 --> 35:52.421
Wow, we have some other things.

35:52.501 --> 35:56.085
After 4.02 we have the 47 Perfections Learning Stream.

35:56.145 --> 36:04.472
Yeah, we're gonna do our best and maybe we'll get some help from some JP Ruffians who know a little bit better the map of Japan, maybe?

36:04.532 --> 36:04.733
Yeah.

36:06.198 --> 36:09.539
And then we have Nerissa's 3D debut!

36:09.579 --> 36:10.999
Yeah!

36:11.159 --> 36:14.020
On Friday, August 9th at 8 p.m.

36:14.120 --> 36:14.420
PT.

36:14.460 --> 36:15.440
Don't forget!

36:15.920 --> 36:17.981
Yeah, don't forget.

36:18.381 --> 36:24.242
And then we have, on the very next day, our 3D debut at 8 p.m.

36:24.282 --> 36:24.422
PT.

36:28.727 --> 36:38.395
Everything that we worked so so so hard for, all the practice, all the tears, all the sweat, everything goes into this one big day.

36:38.415 --> 36:39.275
I hope I can sleep.

36:39.295 --> 36:40.816
I hope I can sleep.

36:40.896 --> 36:41.657
I hope I can sleep.

36:41.757 --> 36:42.478
I hope I can sleep.

36:43.527 --> 36:44.928
Please be there, my friends.

36:44.948 --> 36:47.529
Please be there to cheer us on and BAU BAU BAU!

36:47.689 --> 36:48.329
It's okay!

36:48.349 --> 36:49.450

36:50.650 --> 36:58.994
And then, afterwards, on the very next day at 6pm PT, we will be having a big afterparty for a 3D showcase!

36:59.434 --> 37:07.697
Please, please let us talk to you about all the stuff we've been doing, all the practice, what we did, this and that, and all.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.761
