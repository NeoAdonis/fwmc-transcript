00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.406
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:04.635
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.684 --> 00:05:20.945
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:27.954
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:32.861
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:35.725
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:36.266
BAU BAU!

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:43.272
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:47.795
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 104th episode!

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.076
BAU BAU!

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:53.399
Extra silly today, you think?

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.320
Oh, Ruffians.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.086
If only you knew how silly it is today!

00:06:02.126 --> 00:06:06.389
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us for

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:10.161
The start of your week, another FUWAMOCO Morning app!

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:12.983
The start of your summer maybe!

00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:14.264
Episode 104!

00:06:14.805 --> 00:06:17.948
BAU BAU!

00:06:18.168 --> 00:06:21.811
Ruffians will be joining us today for the very first time!

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:27.657
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:29.178
A.K.A FUWAMOCO!

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:30.760
It's hosted by us!

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.901
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:39.245
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:45.248
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:49.190
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.712
BAU BAU!

00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:59.266
This is your first FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.708
BAU BAU!

00:07:01.728 --> 00:07:05.269
Hopefully it'll be a wonderful start to your day!

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.151
Get you right started on the right paw.

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:09.231
It's 11am for you!

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:11.012
The start of your morning!

00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:13.293
It's still the start.

00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:14.354
Yeah!

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:21.297
I'm excited to see what, you know, this week holds, what this summer holds for us Ruffians!

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:22.077
A new month.

00:07:22.537 --> 00:07:24.158
Yeah!

00:07:24.198 --> 00:07:24.658
Lightning.

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:28.700
Well, uh, the next bit is a bit frightening too.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.262
It's Friday night, but... It's summertime, you know summer's supposed to be fun!

00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:36.603
Ice cream!

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:37.604
No.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.464
Water, no?

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:39.945
No, nothing like that.

00:07:39.965 --> 00:07:40.725
We had another...

00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:42.605
Pero Sighting.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:43.965
Pero Sighting.

00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:48.447
No Bikini Pero, that would be terrifying, Ruffians!

00:07:48.547 --> 00:07:50.588
Well, let's take a look!

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:54.630
De-den!

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.253
I don't think this is a Bikini Pero, but we're not too sure.

00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:03.935
Would it be better if it was Bikini Pero?

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:10.499
You are really brave to try out and get through Friday night of Fridays.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.121
Did you get through all the nights though?

00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:14.682
Every single one!

00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:17.845
It looks like there's something extra nasty there though.

00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:18.965
Yeah.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:19.426
Pero.

00:08:19.446 --> 00:08:20.547
Pero.

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:23.268
You won't leave is your game.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.134
You know, we were seeing a bunch of crazy things we were playing.

00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:32.857
You know, Golden Freddy?

00:08:32.957 --> 00:08:34.439
I don't know, we saw a lot of stuff.

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.921
Yeah, we got killed by nothing too.

00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:38.582
I don't know.

00:08:38.642 --> 00:08:39.463
Not fair!

00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:43.106
Yeah, well, maybe that's...

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.662
Extra lucky or maybe extra unlucky.

00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:49.784
Extra nasty, that's for sure.

00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:51.646
Extra nasty peron.

00:08:52.827 --> 00:08:56.570
We hope that you were able to get through all his nastiness.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.551
It can be a bit much.

00:08:59.552 --> 00:09:02.774
You know, maybe a pudding for him can help things a bit.

00:09:02.794 --> 00:09:03.495
Or for you.

00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:09.680
But good job being brave!

00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:12.202
BAU BAU!

00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:15.424
FUWAMOCO, we're pretty brave, right?

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:17.926
Oh, he's making the game better!

00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:20.709
That's an interesting take on things.

00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:23.871
I don't know if I agree with that one, but okay!

00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:28.675
Ruffians just want to make every game fluffy and fuzzy and a little bit nasty, I guess.

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:30.597
Is that what you like, Ruffians?

00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:34.380
Fluffy, fuzzy, and nasty, huh?

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.742
We need that game!

00:09:36.723 --> 00:09:36.943
No.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:41.528
BAU BAU!

00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:44.571
Yeah, it makes it extra terrifying.

00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:46.172
I guess it's true.

00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:47.759
Yeah.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:48.640
It's not wrong.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.241
Yeah.

00:09:50.782 --> 00:09:54.927
Speaking of terrifying, terrifying in a terrific sense.

00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:56.609
I always get confused about that.

00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:57.270
Terrifying.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.057
Oh, that's terrific, but then terrific, terrifying, but terrific, good terrifying.

00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:04.439
I wonder why, huh?

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:06.348
I get confused.

00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:07.990
Ruffians!

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:16.499
The tickets for hololive English's second concert, Breaking Dimensions, went on sale last week!

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.782
How did you do it?

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:21.165
It was quite the battle for the tickets.

00:10:21.782 --> 00:10:23.003
Terrifyingly.

00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:24.804
You got yours!

00:10:25.264 --> 00:10:25.784
You did!

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:28.746
Yeah, it sold out so quickly!

00:10:29.206 --> 00:10:30.387
It was a blood bath!

00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:36.190
There were tens of thousands trying to get their paws on only a few tickets high!

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.350
You got one!

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:37.851
BAU BAU!

00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:43.214
Congratulations to the extremely lucky ones who got the venue tickets.

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:52.801
But for those who didn't, we hope that you'll be cheering us on the Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy way through online streaming tickets with SPW and Spawn.

00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:53.381
Right!

00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:56.163
And you can get them right now too, Ruffians!

00:10:56.203 --> 00:10:57.724
You don't need to worry.

00:10:57.764 --> 00:11:00.106
No more battling, you know.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.007
Don't forget!

00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:02.187
So you have to get it now.

00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:05.287
That way you don't forget!

00:11:05.307 --> 00:11:07.229
The Northwest Passage is very far!

00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:08.730
It's not easy, okay?

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.533
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.291
That Ruffian will be cheering for us as loudly as you can!

00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:44.872
Dancing around and jumping along too!

00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:51.573
You know when you're at the venue, or you have a watch party with friends, or you're joining us on the other side of the computer screen.

00:11:51.593 --> 00:11:54.454
Please make sure that you BAU BAU lots, okay?

00:11:54.554 --> 00:11:56.034
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:56.094 --> 00:11:56.495
FUWAMOCO!

00:11:56.535 --> 00:11:58.315
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:00.015
Breaking dimensions!

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:01.416
Like that, okay?

00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:02.856
That's what I want to hear, okay?

00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:04.997
You promise?

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:05.657
Yeah.

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:06.757
Gotta forget.

00:12:07.157 --> 00:12:11.080
FUWAMOCO's first stage performance!

00:12:30.123 --> 00:12:32.044
Wow.

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:37.005
You know, I think it goes without saying, but we're gonna bring our best.

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:39.826
The performance of all days.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.166
Oh, our performance!

00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:42.306
I'm fuzzing this one.

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.346
Oi, Moco-chan.

00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:45.327
We will settle for less.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:46.827
BAU BAU!

00:12:46.887 --> 00:12:49.968
We're excited!

00:12:50.108 --> 00:12:51.469
Yeah, BAU BAU!

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:51.769
BAU BAU!

00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:52.049
Yeah!

00:12:57.218 --> 00:13:01.581
Well, Ruffians, we sure you heard the big news.

00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:11.449
But, over the weekend, the beloved, beloved, very beloved, friend A, she announced... A-chan!

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:19.075
Yeah, A-chan, she announced her retirement and that she would be spending her last day at hololive at the end of last month.

00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:22.818
Yeah, otsukaresama desu.

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:32.317
Right, it was really bittersweet to say goodbye to her after a very, very special seven years here at hololive.

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:34.679
Right, Moco-chan?

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:38.022
Moco-chan, you're getting teary.

00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:45.619
FUWAMOCO will miss her so so much.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:04.874
She was really lovely and welcoming to us as the new demon dogs on the corner!

00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:08.337
I wanted to spend more time together.

00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:11.038
There's never enough time, right?

00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:21.886
Yeah, but we'll treasure the times and the conversations that we had together with her and all the wonderful things that she told us, reassured us with.

00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:28.980
We're wishing each and all the best for the next step at FUWAMOCO!

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.961
Moco-chan, right?

00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:34.385
We're gonna be the strongest twin demon boy band ever, right?

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:35.626
Strong!

00:14:35.987 --> 00:14:37.088
Not crying!

00:14:37.228 --> 00:14:37.748
No!

00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:39.069
No, right?

00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:41.471
My cheeks are not wet, though!

00:14:41.512 --> 00:14:44.935
Yeah, she had an amazing impact, right?

00:14:45.715 --> 00:14:52.260
Yeah, but you know FUWAMOCO will be strong and that way we can make her really proud, right?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.121
We'll make you proud!

00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:53.861
Thank you so much, A-chan!

00:14:54.855 --> 00:14:57.761
Thank you so much, A-chan!

00:14:57.821 --> 00:14:59.725
Thank you, A-chan!

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:01.789
Thank you so much!

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:02.330
BAU BAU!

00:15:19.488 --> 00:15:20.609
Lots of good memories.

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:22.190
Let's cheer her on!

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.812
Let's keep the memories in our heart, okay?

00:15:25.673 --> 00:15:28.075
BAU BAU!

00:15:30.577 --> 00:15:32.418
Legend is forever, forever, forever!

00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:39.744
Today is the first day of July.

00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:40.825
First day of July.

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:44.529
Somehow, July and August are officially summer.

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:45.189
Right, Ruffians?

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:46.410
It's officially summer.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.972
You agree with us, right?

00:15:48.732 --> 00:15:50.214
It's officially summer.

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:51.495
Summer has started.

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:53.679
Summer, summer!

00:15:53.699 --> 00:15:55.320
Do you think it's summer?

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.901
Yes, yes, yes, yes, summer!

00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:59.482
When it's cold and it's hot, it's summer.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.002
When it's gonna be summer, it's summer.

00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:01.843
July is summer.

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.083
August is summer.

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:05.664
Can't disagree with it.

00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:10.946
Well, you think of summer, Ruffians, you know, ice cream is a big one.

00:16:11.006 --> 00:16:11.906
Ice cream is good.

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:14.547
Ah, sunscreen because the sun is really strong.

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:15.308
Important!

00:16:15.608 --> 00:16:15.888
Yes!

00:16:16.628 --> 00:16:19.372
It's also fun in the water.

00:16:19.573 --> 00:16:20.194
Water?

00:16:20.534 --> 00:16:31.250
Right, you might have seen Ruffians, but hololive is having a collaboration with a water park and us, FUWAMOCO, we're participating in it!

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.711
The Liyue Village Rotten Pie.

00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:36.093
You know what this means, right?

00:16:36.113 --> 00:16:38.414
Too many pies!

00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:39.294
Look at all of us.

00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:42.816
I need to scroll because there's so much of us.

00:16:43.056 --> 00:16:52.722
You know we have Ayame-senpai, Mari-sencho-senpai, Nenechi, Muna-senpai, Kubo-senpai.

00:16:52.922 --> 00:16:54.563
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:16:54.603 --> 00:16:55.183
Who's next?

00:16:55.977 --> 00:16:56.977
Inose-pon.

00:16:57.037 --> 00:16:59.818
The cute, the cute, the bond.

00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:00.058
Grassy pond.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:12.446
It's kind of nice, though this is like a swimsuit debut, right?

00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:13.808
What is this?

00:17:13.828 --> 00:17:14.609
Swimsuit debut!

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:17.974
They are... Aren't they cute?

00:17:18.034 --> 00:17:18.434
Cute!

00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:19.856
It's cute!

00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:20.998
Very cute!

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:21.699
Hey!

00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:26.264
Why do I see Ina-senpai?

00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:28.586
Ina-senpai's pretty cute though.

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:36.752
Moco-chan, don't get jealous!

00:17:37.093 --> 00:17:50.824
Tickets for the Leofu Village Water Park go on sale on July 5th at 12pm, but there'll be also a lot of special photo areas and other special things hiding around the park.

00:17:52.379 --> 00:17:56.963
Special voice messages from us that you can only hear there too!

00:17:57.263 --> 00:17:58.264
Of course!

00:17:58.504 --> 00:17:58.925
Of course?

00:17:59.205 --> 00:18:02.848
There'll be special merchandise and special food!

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:06.571
And special life slides and more!

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:13.597
And we'll also be entitled to the fish travel water slides, so please come ride it with us, okay?

00:18:13.637 --> 00:18:14.658
I'm so excited!

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.279
Everything is special, okay?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.581
Yeah!

00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:21.343
Especially because it's swimsuits.

00:18:21.463 --> 00:18:22.664
Right, Ruffians?

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:23.345
FUWAMOCO.

00:18:23.385 --> 00:18:23.545
Yeah!

00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:26.107
FUWAMOCO swimsuits!

00:18:26.307 --> 00:18:29.790
Do you think Muna-senpai would switch swimsuits with me?

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.771
What do you mean?

00:18:30.891 --> 00:18:31.371
Me?

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:33.733
No, you would fit that, Moco-chan.

00:18:34.153 --> 00:18:35.575
What?!

00:18:36.175 --> 00:18:37.076
Ruffians.

00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:39.278
Yeah!

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:40.378
Ruffians!

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.901
With this.

00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:47.970
I can't say that Mococo isn't sexy, right?

00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:50.411
Right?

00:18:52.112 --> 00:18:54.673
Right?

00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:56.813
Look!

00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:00.355
You have little floaties there, Moco-chan.

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:02.315
Are you sure?

00:19:02.355 --> 00:19:03.516
It's time for this again!

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:04.556
They're not floaties!

00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:06.497
Look at them closely, okay?

00:19:07.777 --> 00:19:09.078
The proof is right there!

00:19:11.662 --> 00:19:16.643
Ruffians, definitely go check it out if you want to see our best doggy paddle too!

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:16.963
BAU BAU!

00:19:16.983 --> 00:19:20.884
I think you look good doggy paddle, okay?

00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:21.785
Yeah.

00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:24.745
But, is the doggy paddle sexy?

00:19:28.346 --> 00:19:29.867
Is a doggy paddle ever sexy?

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:35.477
That's up to you.

00:19:35.537 --> 00:19:36.377
We'll think about it.

00:19:36.937 --> 00:19:39.838
BAU BAU!

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:41.558
BAU BAU!

00:19:42.018 --> 00:19:44.059
There's so many exciting things going on.

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:47.120
This is the water park you have to go to.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.060
Wow!

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:56.041
Also, Ruffians, you know, our new kouhai Justice just debuted.

00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:58.702
And actually, we got

00:20:00.189 --> 00:20:01.850
FUWAMOCO School!

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.531
BAU BAU!

00:20:03.792 --> 00:20:05.132
Let's check it out!

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:06.673
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:20:06.713 --> 00:20:07.954
Thank you so much!

00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:08.655
Thank you!

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:11.897
I live for the impeccable journalism!

00:20:12.437 --> 00:20:12.838
Yes!

00:20:12.998 --> 00:20:19.222
Yes, in Elizabeth and her very first Archive Karaoke stream, she did well.

00:20:19.762 --> 00:20:22.783
She sung Advent's original song, Rebellion.

00:20:22.863 --> 00:20:27.025
In case you didn't know it, which I was very happy to hear.

00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:31.747
But I have to admit, when I woke up, she was already done.

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:33.807
So then I checked out the archive.

00:20:33.847 --> 00:20:35.488
I was like, oh, Rebellion!

00:20:35.948 --> 00:20:36.849
And I clicked it.

00:20:37.129 --> 00:20:37.809
The timestamp.

00:20:37.829 --> 00:20:40.790
Thank you timestamp, Ruffians.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.852
And I was very surprised because this is how I woke up.

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:47.540
Ruffians!

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.502
Elizabeth is a monster!

00:20:50.942 --> 00:20:55.805
She shocked the entire enchilada to rebellion in one breath!

00:20:58.507 --> 00:20:59.888
Try it right now, okay?

00:20:59.928 --> 00:21:00.589
Ruffians!

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:05.232
A, D, V, E, M, T. Time to get this party started.

00:21:05.292 --> 00:21:08.935
Fire, fire, light the fire brighter, higher as you desire.

00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:09.175
Ow!

00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:17.525
I can't.

00:21:17.965 --> 00:21:18.466
I can't.

00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:19.246
Ruffians.

00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:20.507
We're a bit tired too.

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:21.568
Yeah, we're a bit.

00:21:21.768 --> 00:21:24.050
You know, it's the end of the day.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.292
We're very tired too.

00:21:26.712 --> 00:21:28.113
Yeah, is it even possible?

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:29.354
You try, Ruffians.

00:21:29.694 --> 00:21:31.455
You give it your best shot.

00:21:31.495 --> 00:21:34.698
You sing it as beautiful as Elizabeth, which would be something.

00:21:35.518 --> 00:21:37.080
And you do it in one breath, okay?

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.600
It's just not possible.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.741
But it is if you're a monster like Elizabeth.

00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:43.421
Monster.

00:21:43.981 --> 00:21:45.062
And that's how I woke up.

00:21:45.122 --> 00:21:47.862
Fuwawa was like, Moco-chan, listen!

00:21:47.902 --> 00:21:52.123
She's a monster!

00:21:52.483 --> 00:21:58.105
She just took the entire beginning to her ability in one breath.

00:21:58.125 --> 00:21:59.225
I was like, hi.

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:00.125
Yeah.

00:22:00.885 --> 00:22:01.286
Hi.

00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:03.346
We're demon dogs, Moco-chan.

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.566
We have to do the same.

00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:04.666
Okay.

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:06.067
Doggy paddle.

00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:13.006
Lots of doggy paddling and then we can sing Rebellion in one breath.

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:13.946
The entire song.

00:22:15.647 --> 00:22:16.747
Take that, Elizabeth.

00:22:16.807 --> 00:22:17.367
Entire song.

00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:18.167
That's the goal, okay?

00:22:18.207 --> 00:22:18.508
BAU BAU!

00:22:18.528 --> 00:22:26.790
Good luck with all the karaoke, Elizabeth!

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.210
BAU BAU!

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.831
Big ones, very big ones.

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.652
We have to do some more doggy paddling.

00:22:34.672 --> 00:22:35.692
It's a bit hard, huh?

00:22:36.752 --> 00:22:39.433
Yeah.

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:41.394
Wow, Ruffians!

00:22:41.714 --> 00:22:42.554
It's one day.

00:22:43.114 --> 00:22:47.936
It's been a little while, but it's the time of the week, Ruffians!

00:22:48.457 --> 00:22:56.460
You know, a new FUWAMOCO Morning, a new week, and a new challenge!

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.521
Moco-chan's Natto Challenge!

00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:02.602
Is what I want to say.

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:19.263
But Ruffians, after the 100th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning and many many displays of braveness, Moco-chan's natto challenge is coming to a close today.

00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:21.264
I win!

00:23:21.284 --> 00:23:24.344
Moco-chan, your thoughts?

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:25.645
I win!

00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:28.286
I don't know Ruffians.

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:29.886
I think I've grown quite a lot.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.010
I've grown a kinda lot.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.631
I've grown a kinda lot.

00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:36.372
Before I couldn't.

00:23:36.992 --> 00:23:40.053
Just the smell was enough to not be good.

00:23:41.493 --> 00:23:43.054
And now I can sort of eat them.

00:23:43.654 --> 00:23:44.734
She can sort of eat them.

00:23:44.754 --> 00:23:47.115
Do you agree with this statement, Ruffians?

00:23:50.737 --> 00:23:52.138
How about a pizza challenge?

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:55.561
PIZZA CHALLENGE AFTER MIDNIGHT RuffianS!

00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.743
What are you trying to do, Hai?

00:23:57.763 --> 00:23:59.464
I don't know.

00:23:59.724 --> 00:24:07.711
Yeah, but Moco-chan, you know, I do agree that eating natto at midnight, right before bed, is a little bit difficult.

00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:13.676
Ruffians, it's too difficult for me to eat natto right before bed.

00:24:14.056 --> 00:24:14.537
My tummy...

00:24:15.477 --> 00:24:15.718
No.

00:24:16.098 --> 00:24:16.599
Yeah.

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:20.602
But Moco-chan, you promised that you'll make it as homework, right?

00:24:20.983 --> 00:24:24.846
You'll give Ruffians regular updates on how the natto eating is going.

00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:24.926
Yes.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.492
She said yes, right?

00:24:31.292 --> 00:24:31.633
Right!

00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:35.480
Midnight Pizza Challenge!

00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:38.363
I don't know, what about last time?

00:24:39.143 --> 00:24:42.046
That's hard on a midnight Tommy too.

00:24:42.146 --> 00:24:43.227
I don't know, Ruffians.

00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:45.889
Ask Mei-senpai to do that, okay?

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.650
Not me!

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.974
Okay.

00:24:52.154 --> 00:24:56.778
Wow, Moco-chan, do you mess with your homework with the Ruffians regularly?

00:24:56.798 --> 00:24:59.200
How are you and Nanatoi getting along?

00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:00.221
Yes.

00:25:01.153 --> 00:25:03.354
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:26.066
Every single day we're challenging ourselves.

00:25:26.086 --> 00:25:29.169
Who could say every single day is a challenge?

00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:31.571
That's a different meaning, darling!

00:25:31.591 --> 00:25:34.133
BAU BAU!

00:25:35.213 --> 00:25:42.319
Again, thank you so much to all the farmers for their delicious natto.

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:47.083
And Ruffians, we hope that you try it someday too, okay?

00:25:47.483 --> 00:25:49.605
BAU BAU!

00:25:52.944 --> 00:25:55.547
You said goodbye to the natto.

00:25:55.727 --> 00:25:59.432
But let's say hello to our Doggie of the Day today!

00:25:59.812 --> 00:26:03.337
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:05.540
We have... De-den!

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.342
Anyo!

00:26:07.802 --> 00:26:08.203
Hi!

00:26:08.563 --> 00:26:10.725
I'm just having some nice dreams, hi!

00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:17.530
Chiyuki, you know, I know Senpai's really cute, but this Anya here... So cute!

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.392
A bit sleepy, huh?

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:22.314
I'm just gonna fall asleep on my big booty.

00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:23.315
I'm sleepy.

00:26:24.155 --> 00:26:26.637
This looks like a good pillow.

00:26:27.198 --> 00:26:27.878
I think so.

00:26:27.938 --> 00:26:30.801
You know, when you're tired, anything's a good pillow, right?

00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:32.302
I'm gonna take a nap now.

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:35.384
Yeah, just like a hard bone can be a good pillow too.

00:26:35.404 --> 00:26:35.945
Good pillow.

00:26:36.465 --> 00:26:38.646
Doesn't matter if you're sleepy.

00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:40.668
You're sleepy.

00:26:40.828 --> 00:26:43.749
How do you think I'm about BAU, Moco-chan?

00:26:55.214 --> 00:27:06.363
I can tell for sure that Anya is having some very sweet dreams of delicious bones.

00:27:06.704 --> 00:27:13.149
And hopefully, you know, once maybe this pillow disappears, maybe there'll be more pillows.

00:27:13.169 --> 00:27:14.610
More pillows in the future!

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.652
Hopefully not the ones with feathers.

00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:18.773
Bone pillows.

00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:20.235
Bone pillows.

00:27:20.915 --> 00:27:21.856
BAU BAU!

00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:26.885
And next, Ruffians, you know it's the summer time.

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:30.748
It is perfect to go outside right now as long as you remember your sunscreen.

00:27:30.768 --> 00:27:31.749
It's not too hot outside.

00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:35.772
So let's take a look on the little adventures you've been going on.

00:27:35.792 --> 00:27:37.914
Let's take a look.

00:27:38.234 --> 00:27:38.535
De-den!

00:27:42.917 --> 00:27:44.058
A tree!

00:27:44.358 --> 00:27:49.599
This tree looks like a knee joint!

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:50.279
That's what it does!

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:52.680
It's like an elbow.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.820
What's the difference between a knee and an elbow?

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.781
Arm bend.

00:27:57.021 --> 00:27:57.941
Knee bend.

00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:58.941
Leg bend.

00:27:59.081 --> 00:27:59.401
Arm bend.

00:27:59.421 --> 00:27:59.861
Knee bend.

00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:01.362
Oh, arm bend, leg bend?

00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:04.854
Ruffians!

00:28:05.354 --> 00:28:06.937
Do your knees look like this?

00:28:07.057 --> 00:28:09.141
All barky and wassy.

00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:10.322
I should hope not.

00:28:10.342 --> 00:28:11.785
It looks like a tree.

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:17.059
Yeah!

00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:18.400
Yeah!

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.604
We gotta rub some moisturizer on the barky like that.

00:28:23.724 --> 00:28:24.325
Yeah.

00:28:24.345 --> 00:28:25.426
Stop the barking.

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:28.729
I'm gonna pull off the moss too.

00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:34.414
FUWAMOCO-chan, you're ready, right?

00:28:34.434 --> 00:28:36.115
I'll pull off the moss!

00:28:37.876 --> 00:28:39.077
You feel insulted?

00:28:40.749 --> 00:28:42.791
Pull off the most gently.

00:28:43.271 --> 00:28:43.892
Gently.

00:28:44.412 --> 00:28:46.895
And then when you least expect it... Pull it!

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:47.415
BAU BAU!

00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:53.321
Thank you for sharing such a cool channel with us!

00:28:53.381 --> 00:28:55.342
BAU BAU!

00:28:55.362 --> 00:28:56.183
BAU BAU!

00:28:58.885 --> 00:29:01.886
We got a question from the Ruffians.

00:29:02.187 --> 00:29:05.888
Our Question of the Day is... De-den!

00:29:06.308 --> 00:29:11.430
Cecilia Imogreen went to amusement arcade on her debut stream.

00:29:14.314 --> 00:29:16.236
A math question?

00:29:16.677 --> 00:29:20.060
Do you have any memories or feelings about amusement arcades?

00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:21.001
FUWAMOCO!

00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:22.022
We love arcades so much!

00:29:32.993 --> 00:29:35.574
We go and play games together with Mama Puppy!

00:29:35.694 --> 00:29:39.434
You know, just having fun on the weekends and stuff.

00:29:39.454 --> 00:29:42.515
Just like special times, you know?

00:29:42.595 --> 00:29:46.676
We had lots of fun, uh... Ruffians.

00:29:47.336 --> 00:29:49.216
We did beat some games, okay?

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:53.237
Yeah, we put enough coins in to beat games.

00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:54.437
Yeah.

00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:56.438
We did, okay?

00:29:56.478 --> 00:29:59.679
You might not believe us.

00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:00.379
Yeah.

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:01.279
Uh...

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:10.265
Yeah, another one finding, finding Idle Master, the original arcade Idle Master 2 many years after!

00:30:10.305 --> 00:30:11.145
Yeah!

00:30:11.466 --> 00:30:12.166
Didn't cry.

00:30:12.587 --> 00:30:12.847
No.

00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:13.868
No, definitely didn't.

00:30:14.128 --> 00:30:14.208
No.

00:30:14.248 --> 00:30:15.890
You know, playing Dance of the Gods.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:16.070
Yeah!

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.714
A game where you become a train driver.

00:30:19.894 --> 00:30:20.654
BAU BAU!

00:30:20.895 --> 00:30:26.039
There is one, one arcade game that I'm always, always looking for.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.301
Played it once.

00:30:28.767 --> 00:30:29.207
Which one?

00:30:29.887 --> 00:30:33.248
Space Adventure Cobra the game.

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:38.089
Get the psycho gun, you can play with the psycho gun!

00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:41.790
I want to play with the psycho gun!

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.031
Yes, it's so fun!

00:30:43.051 --> 00:30:51.493
You know the ones where you're on like a bike and then you're like flying and then the ones where you're in like the raft and you're like... The ones too!

00:30:52.913 --> 00:30:55.555
So many fun, good memories at the arcade.

00:30:55.635 --> 00:30:57.236
We go to arcades so much!

00:30:57.256 --> 00:30:59.358
They don't really feel real though, right?

00:30:59.418 --> 00:31:02.200
There are so many memories at arcades.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.782
Like an alternate reality.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:08.825
The first time we went to the arcades, Fuwamoco wasn't crying at all!

00:31:09.065 --> 00:31:12.607
We also went to arcades with Mama Puppy.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.011
Lots of I.Q.

00:31:17.131 --> 00:31:17.991
memories!

00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:18.572
Time crisis.

00:31:18.632 --> 00:31:19.272
BAU BAU!

00:31:19.292 --> 00:31:20.033
Protect the arcades.

00:31:20.073 --> 00:31:23.875
Thank you so much for all your submissions today!

00:31:42.572 --> 00:31:44.572
Thank you for the very cute puppies recently.

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:46.993
Thank you for the wonderful photos of your puppies.

And your scoops, too.

00:31:51.974 --> 00:31:53.174
There's a lot going on.

00:31:53.335 --> 00:31:55.635
Especially in hololive English right now.

00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:57.115
Cute questions, cute walks.

00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:58.476
Not cute Pero.

00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:02.797
If you happen to see Pero, I guess you can let us know what's going on there.

00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:04.777
Yeah, but he's not gonna be cute.

00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:07.678
Please make sure you use the hashtag.

00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:09.738
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:32:09.878 --> 00:32:09.998

00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:11.319

00:32:18.563 --> 00:32:25.367
We're playing together up front, so you know, we had some postponements last week.

This week, you know, it's FUWAMOCO GANBAIDEN week!

00:32:28.568 --> 00:32:29.409

We're doing it with demon dogs!

We're ruff!

00:32:38.254 --> 00:32:38.615

00:32:38.695 --> 00:32:38.955
No.

00:32:39.176 --> 00:32:46.646
But if we do have to postpone something or cancel it, it's because FUWAMOCO, we are gonna fall apart.

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:49.610
Okay.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.111
Yeah.

It's a little bit different than our usual time.

00:34:15.084 --> 00:34:16.265
Be careful, okay?

00:34:16.466 --> 00:34:22.352
We're going to be having a club all together with Advent and we're playing old school RUNSCAPE.

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:55.659
Right!

00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:56.760
There's so much to say!

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.921
What should we not say?

00:35:58.961 --> 00:36:01.962
We're gonna do a Shiori and go on a tangent.

00:36:01.982 --> 00:36:04.883
This is my first video and I love it so much!

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:05.984

So much stuff.

00:36:49.852 --> 00:36:54.315
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:36:54.415 --> 00:37:04.521
I know when we shared our schedule on Twitter, we mentioned this as well, but FUWAMOCO and Rock n' Rawr Party will be back this month in July!

00:37:04.761 --> 00:37:06.643
So we hope that you'll look forward to that.

00:37:06.703 --> 00:37:09.565
We have so many songs we want to sing, Ruffians!

00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:13.347
Oh, we've been holding it in for a long time.

00:37:13.728 --> 00:37:16.009
Yeah, all the songs we want to sing.

00:37:16.029 --> 00:37:18.311
The boy group has to hold a bit.

00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:19.552
Yeah.

00:37:20.172 --> 00:37:24.135
So thank you, Ruffians, for meeting and for looking forward to them.

00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:26.997
We're gonna have a bunch of fun this month.
