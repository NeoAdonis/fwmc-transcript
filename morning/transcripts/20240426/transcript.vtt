00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:29.549

Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag "hashtag FUWAMOCO Morning"!

00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:27.590
Oh, Moco-chan, you want a big BAU BAU?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.791
One moment.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:37.346
Let's all BAU BAU to FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:08:37.946 --> 00:08:40.147
BAU BAU!

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:41.367
Moco-chan big BAU BAU!

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:45.209
It's so much fun with Koyori-senpai here.

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:46.469
Thank you!

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:55.612
No, no!

00:08:55.632 --> 00:08:58.193
Thank you!

00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:01.874
Thank you very much!

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:05.175
I have some bad news.

00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:07.616
No, no, no bad news, no.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:08.557
No bad news.

00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:08.857
Why?

00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:13.758
There's been another peron sighting!

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:14.579
Slow pain?

00:09:15.599 --> 00:09:18.722
Pero's nasty.

00:09:19.163 --> 00:09:20.304
Pero's nasty.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.740
Pero, Koyori, BAU BAU?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.640
Is Pero scared?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.301
Maybe Koyori-senpai is BAU BAUing.

00:09:41.321 --> 00:09:43.202
Pero is running away.

00:09:43.222 --> 00:09:45.663
Koyori-senpai is a coyote.

00:09:45.703 --> 00:09:48.604
Maybe Pero will run away from Koyori-senpai.

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:50.104
Let's see where Pero is.

00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:51.685
Let's see where Pero is.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:52.105
De-den!

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:02.550
Cute!

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.270
Cute Pero!

00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.111
Cute Pero!

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:04.752
Cute!

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:13.799
Well, you know, I think maybe this Ruffian thought they were gonna have a nice cappuccino, but... No.

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:15.020
It was Pero!

00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:27.945
I don't know how I feel if this was the drink I received, but the barista probably put a lot of their heart and soul into it, but I don't know.

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:33.187
I feel like something kind of nasty got accidentally added to this drink.

00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:36.408
But Koyori-senpai!

00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:38.149
Do you like cappuccino?

00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:40.970
Do you like cappuccino?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.571
I love cappuccino.

00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:46.107
PAPUCCINO!

00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:46.949
PAPUCCINO!

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:49.253
Because they're canines, I guess PAPUCCINO!

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:51.277
PAPUCCINO!

00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:52.559
PAPUCCINO!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.104
Not PELOCHINO!

00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:58.149
Not PELOCHINO!

00:10:58.169 --> 00:10:58.891
PAPUCCINO!

00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:01.395
Do you want to drink this PELOCHINO?

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.339
Cappuccino art?

00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:06.224
Oh, I love it!

00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:07.446
Cappuccino art!

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:10.567
FUWAMOCO-chan art.

00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:13.369
I want to do a lemon mibare.

00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:13.989
Afraid.

00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:34.705
I want Koyori-senpai's design on my cappuccino then.

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:37.087
Moco-chan, you wanna be BAU BAU?

00:11:37.187 --> 00:11:37.327
Okay.

00:12:03.186 --> 00:12:09.368
BAU BAU!

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:16.031
Maybe this cappuccino, this Perroccino, maybe this is the good kind of Perroccino.

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:16.331
BAU BAU!

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:27.915
Yeah!

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:34.298
Well, since Koyori-senpai is our guest today, we had a question for her.

00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:35.918
Right, Moco-chan?

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:37.479
A question?

00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:37.999
Yeah!

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:53.024
Well, FUWAMOCO, you know that we're kind of picky eaters, and we don't like tomatoes, and we don't like onions, and that kind of goes for mayonnaise too.

00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:53.085
Oh!

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.185
Mayonnaise?

00:12:56.438 --> 00:12:59.502
Mayonnaise!

00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.704
Mayonnaise!

00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:09.134
So we wanted to ask Koyori-senpai What's the yummiest way to eat mayonnaise?

00:13:09.294 --> 00:13:11.937
The yummiest way to eat mayonnaise?

00:13:11.977 --> 00:13:15.241
The yummiest way to eat mayonnaise?

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.464
The yummiest way to eat mayonnaise?

00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:21.108
Mayonnaise

00:13:22.449 --> 00:13:23.790
Beginner?

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.731
Beginner is first mayonnaise.

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:31.994
Curry rice with mayonnaise.

00:13:32.074 --> 00:13:34.095
Have you tried it?

00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:35.936
No, we haven't tried it.

00:13:38.437 --> 00:13:49.525
I thought you know sometimes people put on their curry rice teriyaki sauce.

00:13:51.106 --> 00:13:57.310
I thought they had it at other places, but maybe not.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.413
But the stores, they don't have mayonnaise.

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:10.777
Do you bring your own mayo to the restaurant?

00:14:11.597 --> 00:14:13.939
I am a childhood.

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:16.100
Childhood?

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.300
Childhood.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.481
When you were a child.

00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:20.001
When you were a child.

00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:21.422
Yeah.

00:14:21.662 --> 00:14:23.003
Mochiaruiteta.

00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:24.483
I give up.

00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:24.824
Give up?

00:14:25.024 --> 00:14:25.684
You got it.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:26.644
You got it.

00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:27.665
I eat mayonnaise.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:29.966
But mayonnaise.

00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:31.887
Mochiaruku.

00:14:32.027 --> 00:14:33.107
I take mayonnaise.

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.328
Yeah, take it.

00:14:35.448 --> 00:14:36.529
Kusarisou.

00:14:37.562 --> 00:14:38.804
Oh, it goes back.

00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:39.785
That's my Insta.

00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:40.826
Hey, Mayonnaise Bridge!

00:14:59.887 --> 00:15:01.968
Did they bring you mayonnaise?

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:02.988
Staff-san.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:03.469
Yes, yes, yes!

00:15:03.489 --> 00:15:03.969
Mayonnaise!

00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:04.589
Is this it?

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:05.069
Yes!

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:09.472
Mayonnaise is a must item.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.553
That's a must item.

00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:11.313
Like ketchup!

00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:13.394
In Japanese.

00:15:26.024 --> 00:15:30.909
By the way, Koyori-senpai, do you like ketchup?

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.813
Ketchup, I like.

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:42.101
But the one you put on ketchup, I usually put mayonnaise on it.

00:15:42.301 --> 00:15:42.821
I see.

00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:47.006
So instead of using ketchup, Koyori-senpai, you use mayonnaise.

00:15:47.966 --> 00:15:48.686
Omurice.

00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.747
Potato fries.

00:15:51.027 --> 00:15:53.348
Fries too and omurice.

00:15:54.648 --> 00:15:56.028
All mayonnaise.

00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:57.349
Wow!

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.169
Can you imagine?

00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:02.330
If we have ponzu mix and mayonnaise!

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.130
Ponzu mix!

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.491
Mayonnaise!

00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:07.872
Pon-de-ring!

00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:11.454
No, no, not with mayonnaise.

00:16:11.494 --> 00:16:12.595
But delicious.

00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:12.975
Right?

00:16:12.995 --> 00:16:13.596
Delicious?

00:16:13.936 --> 00:16:14.836
Yeah.

00:16:14.977 --> 00:16:16.017
I sort of want to try now.

00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:18.639
I want to try pon-de-ring and mayonnaise.

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:20.980
I want to try pon-de-ring and curry.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.002
Pon-de-ring and curry!

00:16:24.182 --> 00:16:26.223
Pon-de-ring and curry!

00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:28.185
Pon-de-ring is a bit like rice.

00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:35.163
I have another question.

00:16:35.183 --> 00:16:42.169
Koyori-senpai, you said you were worried about it going bad.

00:16:50.855 --> 00:16:52.477
Does Japanese mayo go bad?

00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:58.603
I heard that in Japan, you don't need to put mayonnaise in the fridge.

00:17:08.297 --> 00:17:09.298
Not in the fridge.

00:17:09.598 --> 00:17:10.578
Not in the fridge.

00:17:10.658 --> 00:17:13.060
OK, but summer is too hot in Japan.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.040
That makes sense.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:14.640
I see.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.761
In winter it's OK.

00:17:16.882 --> 00:17:17.582
OK, OK, OK.

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:37.577
Thank you, Koyori-senpai, for your mayonnaise wisdom!

00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:39.338
I want to eat mayo now.

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:39.719
Drink!

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:40.119
Drink!

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:41.600
Drink mayo!

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.022
Mayonnaise is drinking!

00:17:44.182 --> 00:17:45.063
It's a drink?

00:17:45.323 --> 00:17:47.445
Okay.

00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:50.068
Mayo choo-choo!

00:17:50.108 --> 00:17:52.089
Giving kisses to the mayonnaise too!

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.885
Okay, today's FUWAMOCO your morning has mayonnaise kisses.

00:17:57.985 --> 00:17:58.946
Okay?

00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:00.528
Mayonnaise kisses!

00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:15.822
BAU BAU!

00:18:16.542 --> 00:18:21.084
We also had a question.

00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:23.604
Koyori-senpai.

00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:26.685
Why is today not a sleepover?

00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.786
Why is there no youbai party?

00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:30.026
Good.

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:31.706
Why isn't there a sleepover?

00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:35.567
Why isn't there a youbai party?

00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:37.448
We had that question.

00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:39.949
I don't have bed.

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:41.369
I have only single bed.

00:18:54.154 --> 00:19:01.159
Ah, then FUWAMOCO will use your bed and Koyori-senpai can sleep on the ground.

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:07.164
FUWAMOCO will sleep in Koyori-senpai's single bed, but Koyori-senpai will sleep under her bed.

00:19:07.204 --> 00:19:09.085
That's fine, because she's a dog!

00:19:09.245 --> 00:19:12.768
No, no, no, no, no!

00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:14.549
Boss dog!

00:19:14.729 --> 00:19:16.250
You are a dog too!

00:19:16.671 --> 00:19:17.871
We're dogs too, but...

00:19:19.232 --> 00:19:20.253
No, no, no, no, no!

00:19:20.273 --> 00:19:20.313
No!

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:20.653
No!

00:19:20.673 --> 00:19:20.793
Kaere!

00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:42.453
I want to give to Pajama Advent members.

00:19:42.693 --> 00:19:43.714
All members!

00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:02.501
So then the Yobai Party will have to wait until all of Advent's here!

00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:06.704
And then Koyori-senpai will have special pajamas for us!

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:13.428
Well, we'll have to hope they're not yabai pajamas.

00:20:13.468 --> 00:20:16.269
Yabai pajamas for the Yobai Party.

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:21.512
The pajamas Koyori-senpai will be giving away aren't yabai pajamas, right?

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.162
I'm not sexy!

00:20:27.262 --> 00:20:28.623
I'm Fuwawa!

00:20:28.703 --> 00:20:30.845
Are you sure about that?

00:20:31.265 --> 00:20:35.789
Are you sure you wanna be saying that?

00:20:49.588 --> 00:20:51.490
Is this a question to ask us?

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.472
Doggy Pack!

00:20:54.952 --> 00:20:57.774
How is it?

00:20:57.834 --> 00:21:02.337
How is it?

00:21:02.437 --> 00:21:06.660
Maybe that will have to wait until the Yobai Party with Advent.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.202
Is it a secret until the Yobai Party?

00:21:09.222 --> 00:21:09.462
Secret!

00:21:09.502 --> 00:21:10.683
Look forward to it!

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.825
Look forward to it!

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:15.086
Look forward to it!

00:21:15.106 --> 00:21:15.567
BAU means...

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:22.269
It's being so kind to give us a gift and think of all us.

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:23.729
I guess anything goes.

00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:45.115
BAU BAU!

00:21:45.155 --> 00:21:47.357
We're looking forward to it!

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.077
BAU BAU!

00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:07.938
Next!

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.562
Konyoni-senpai!

00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:13.767
You have something special that you'd like to share today.

00:22:18.033 --> 00:22:24.514
Koyori-senpai has a new recent original song, Tear Gazer!

00:22:24.534 --> 00:22:31.456
Can you talk about your original song, Koyori-senpai?

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:48.239
Okay, so my first maid word.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.840
Koyori-senpai, you wrote it yourself?

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.420
The lyrics?

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.000
Yes, yes.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.081
Koyo's heart.

00:23:02.273 --> 00:23:18.225
It's a song that Koyori-senpai wrote the lyrics for.

00:23:18.505 --> 00:23:25.231
You know, for times where it's kind of rough and you just don't have the energy or you just don't quite have that pump in your step.

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:26.592
To give you that extra push.

00:23:26.652 --> 00:23:26.932
Yeah.

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.835
And so that you can listen to it and- It has all her feelings and heart in it.

00:23:31.195 --> 00:23:31.655
Question!

00:23:47.123 --> 00:23:50.888
Zettai Akiramenai is English.

00:23:51.428 --> 00:23:52.450
Never give up!

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.271
Never give up!

00:23:53.351 --> 00:23:56.354
Never give up song!

00:23:56.514 --> 00:23:57.996
Never give up song!

00:23:58.096 --> 00:23:59.298
Never give up!

00:23:59.318 --> 00:24:00.119
Never give up!

00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:00.860
Never give up!

00:24:04.464 --> 00:24:06.445
BAU BAU BAU!

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:09.288
Dogs are stubborn, aren't they?

00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:12.610
That's why they never give up.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.094
Us dogs, canine family, we're stubborn!

00:24:17.114 --> 00:24:18.235
We're hungry!

00:24:18.495 --> 00:24:20.317
If we wanna bite you, we'll bite you!

00:24:20.337 --> 00:24:20.457
Bite!

00:24:20.477 --> 00:24:20.777
Bite you?

00:24:20.817 --> 00:24:20.957
Bite!

00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:21.738
Bite you?

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:24.780
Because we're hungry, we'll bite you!

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.581
Bite you!

00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:36.947
Please check it out when you know maybe you're feeling a little bit like it's been a rough day.

00:24:37.028 --> 00:24:41.369
Koyori-senpai will be there to show you it's okay.

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:45.851
Please listen to Tear Gazer, Koyori-senpai's original song.

00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:50.653
Thank you!

00:24:50.673 --> 00:24:50.953
BAU BAU!

00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:51.173
Wow.

00:24:54.932 --> 00:24:58.455
Koyori-senpai, you have Asakoya, your morning show.

00:24:59.075 --> 00:25:05.600
And so, we wanted to take a page out of Asakoya's book and share a serifu.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.943
Yeah, Asakoya lines.

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:25.094
Today's FUWAMOCO lines.

00:25:25.414 --> 00:25:28.016
The first, and hopefully not the last.

00:25:28.036 --> 00:25:32.058
Saisho wa eigo de itte mo ii kana?

00:25:36.494 --> 00:25:38.575
Would you like Fuwawa?

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.516
Would you like Mococo?

00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:46.278
Would you like Koyori?

00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:48.879
No!

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:52.540
FUWAMOCO YO!

00:26:27.222 --> 00:26:28.143

00:26:28.384 --> 00:26:29.325
Not coyori?

00:26:29.465 --> 00:26:29.685
What?

00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:30.125
No!

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:32.568
FUWAMOCO-chan kasamaretai.

00:26:32.988 --> 00:26:35.552
Are you gonna be in between FUWAMOCO?

00:26:42.842 --> 00:26:44.223
No, you're a dog!

00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:46.304
You're a dog!

00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:49.745
No, you're a dog!

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:51.206
You're a dog!

00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:54.407
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:58.249
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:02.951
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

00:27:11.738 --> 00:27:13.840
Let's say it one more time.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.564
Koyori-senpai.

00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:21.509
What do you like about Fuwawa?

00:27:25.182 --> 00:27:26.083
What would you like?

00:27:26.103 --> 00:27:29.004

00:27:29.244 --> 00:27:29.825

00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:46.814
Thank you very much.

00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:47.455
No, thank you, Koyori-senpai!

00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:50.347
Thank you, Koyori-senpai!

00:27:50.887 --> 00:27:51.488
BAU BAU!

00:27:51.948 --> 00:27:54.589
Next, let's take a look at our regular corners!

00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:57.250
Let's go to the corner we always go to!

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:57.550
Yes!

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.010
Yes!

00:27:58.331 --> 00:27:58.851
First up!

00:27:59.571 --> 00:28:02.552
Today, we have our... Doggie of the Day!

00:28:02.612 --> 00:28:03.233
Yes!

00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:05.033
It's today's Doggie of the Day!

00:28:05.453 --> 00:28:08.635
It's today's... It's Moca!

00:28:08.735 --> 00:28:09.175
Moca!

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:09.775
Moca!

00:28:10.015 --> 00:28:10.376
Moca!

00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:17.698
I'm kind of in the way here.

00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:21.059
But Moca, Moca's no longer a puppy.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:27.382
So now Moca is learning to become a pro Frisbee player together with the Ruffians.

00:28:28.082 --> 00:28:30.023
So cute!

00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:33.685
Frisbee is also a way to become a pro.

00:28:33.805 --> 00:28:37.086
Right now they're training.

00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:38.787
Moca's doing their best.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.420
Her face is so serious!

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.701
And her eyes are so cute!

00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:49.902
Cute little black eyes and a nose!

00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:52.582
FUWAMOCO Shiny!

00:28:53.182 --> 00:28:56.963

00:29:34.324 --> 00:29:35.545
I'm sure that's exactly it.

00:29:35.605 --> 00:29:37.908

00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:38.830

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:39.611
Yeah!

00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:42.835
You know, you can tell Moca is doing their best.

00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:48.182
They want to win the competition, but you know, they're still just... just a little bit...

00:29:48.642 --> 00:29:53.704
I'm a puppy, so... Yeah, they're gonna do their best together with their Ruffians!

00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:56.065
And let's all cheer on Moco!

00:29:56.085 --> 00:30:00.427
Hopefully one day we can see them win that frisbee competition!

00:30:00.447 --> 00:30:04.569
BAU BAU!

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:05.069
Oh!

Today I went on a walk!

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.491
You know some, Fuwa!

00:30:12.358 --> 00:30:12.778
Oh!

00:30:13.038 --> 00:30:13.818
A beach!

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:15.920
I went to the beach!

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.941
You went to the beach with a friend!

00:30:17.961 --> 00:30:18.361
So nice!

00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:23.524
Small house is so cute!

00:30:24.085 --> 00:30:24.445
Right!

00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:25.746
Really cute!

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:30.668
Koyari-senpai, do you like to go to the beach?

00:30:30.748 --> 00:30:31.649
So-so.

00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:32.289
So-so.

00:30:36.733 --> 00:30:37.533
I'm surprised.

00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:39.013
Chotto igai desu.

00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:42.174
I wanna see the cute girls in the beach.

00:30:42.214 --> 00:30:45.875
Bikini girl gumi-san janai kana?

00:30:46.055 --> 00:30:47.515
Bikini girl is so good.

00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:48.655
So good!

00:30:48.755 --> 00:30:53.296
The sea is so hot.

00:30:53.576 --> 00:30:56.277
The beach is hot.

00:30:56.517 --> 00:30:59.938
Maybe we can go to the beach together one day.

00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:02.098
Issho ni beach toka wa... How deshita?

00:31:02.138 --> 00:31:02.518
I want to go!

00:31:15.913 --> 00:31:17.754
You know do the thing on the beach where you run?

00:31:18.115 --> 00:31:20.898
The couples, the couples do it and they're like, catch me!

00:31:27.023 --> 00:31:28.864
Oh, I fell in the water!

00:31:29.385 --> 00:31:32.606

Excuse my passion Japanese, I try my best.

00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:06.367
I'll do my best with passion Japanese.

00:32:06.547 --> 00:32:10.270
Konyari and FUWAMOCO often play together.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.393
Konyari, do you like FUWAMOCO?

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.595
I don't want to choose.

00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:19.456
I can't choose.

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:20.776
First love point.

00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:42.717
You're so cute!

00:32:43.618 --> 00:32:44.578
Is that my voice?

00:32:44.738 --> 00:32:45.878
Yeah, voice!

00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:47.799
Kerokero voice!

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:48.059
Love.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:48.759
Love.

00:32:49.099 --> 00:32:49.339
And?

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:51.700
Moco-chan's frog voice.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.360
Yeah!

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.862
FUWAMOCO-chan is never give up hard too.

00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:01.563
Yeah, I never give up too.

00:33:01.683 --> 00:33:02.683
Yes, right.

00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:03.944
Ganbarteru.

00:33:04.064 --> 00:33:04.864
Tottemo.

00:33:04.944 --> 00:33:06.565
Very very ganbaru.

00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:11.932
I see FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:33:12.792 --> 00:33:13.612
I do my best.

00:33:13.652 --> 00:33:14.253
Wow, thank you!

00:33:27.036 --> 00:33:32.898
Koyori-senpai sees FUWAMOCO doing her best and Koyori-senpai wants to wick her too.

00:33:33.258 --> 00:33:33.558
But!

00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:34.698
That's not fair!

00:33:34.758 --> 00:33:35.219

00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:35.679

00:33:54.504 --> 00:33:55.765
What was that just now?

00:33:55.785 --> 00:33:57.366
It's like we're influencing each other.

00:33:57.406 --> 00:33:59.828
We're influencing each other.

00:33:59.848 --> 00:34:01.029
Dogs run in a pack!

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:03.671
Dogs are happier when they have friends.

00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:05.932
I guess that's why.

00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:20.565
I think Fuwamoco-chan is my daughter.

00:34:35.601 --> 00:34:52.813
We'd like to say a big thank you to all the Ruffians and Chushu-kun today too!

00:34:53.173 --> 00:34:56.376
That, you know, shared the Doggie of the Day.

00:34:57.056 --> 00:34:58.477
That works, you know.

00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:10.442
And for all your questions too, FUWAMOCO Morning is something special we make all together with you and today with Koyori-chan.

00:35:10.502 --> 00:35:11.843

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.311
After tomorrow, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.878

00:35:53.364 --> 00:35:54.725
Tanoshii desu ka?

00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:58.347
It is very very fun.

00:35:58.648 --> 00:36:01.250
Melting time.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.911
Time just disappears when you're having fun.

00:36:06.672 --> 00:36:08.832
I get it, yeah.

00:36:08.932 --> 00:36:10.313
Good games are good.

00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:13.634

00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:23.356
Moco-chan has kinda turned a bit into a frog.

00:36:23.777 --> 00:36:24.257
More than a dog.

00:36:25.257 --> 00:36:26.638
There might be some changes.

00:36:26.958 --> 00:36:34.023
There might be a few changes, but FUWAMOCO, we have the holo Dorokei 2024 event coming up.

00:36:34.283 --> 00:36:36.725
Koyori-senpai, you'll be there too, right?

00:36:37.065 --> 00:36:37.905
Yes!

00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:39.887
I am keisatsu.

00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:40.907
No, police!

00:36:41.087 --> 00:36:41.648
Policeman!

00:36:43.274 --> 00:36:45.375
You won't catch FUWAMOCO, right?

00:36:59.764 --> 00:37:02.465
So we'll be all practicing for that.

00:37:02.826 --> 00:37:04.286
So we hope you can catch it.

00:37:04.727 --> 00:37:07.208

Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:39.770
Koyurin-senpai, after FUWAMOCO Morning, you always say the name of the Ruffians.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.292
Can we do that together?

00:37:41.372 --> 00:37:41.492
Okay!
