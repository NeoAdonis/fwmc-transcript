05:31.990 --> 05:35.229
Hello, hello, Happy holo Year!

05:35.329 --> 05:38.550
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:39.331 --> 05:42.992
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:43.132 --> 05:46.473
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:46.573 --> 05:48.334
BAU BAU BAU!

05:49.014 --> 05:51.955
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:52.476 --> 05:54.896
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:55.217 --> 05:56.997
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:57.017 --> 05:59.178
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:59.638 --> 06:04.181
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:04.201 --> 06:06.122
Thank you, Ruffians.

06:06.142 --> 06:09.984
Thank you for joining us today for the 62nd episode.

06:10.064 --> 06:12.765
And our first episode of 2024!

06:12.865 --> 06:13.505
BAU BAU!

06:13.645 --> 06:18.388
I definitely didn't say Happy Halloween.

06:21.378 --> 06:24.060
I was like, Moco-chan, what did you just say?

06:24.440 --> 06:27.702
I definitely did not say Happy Halloween.

06:28.302 --> 06:29.723
Happy New Year.

06:30.483 --> 06:31.444
You didn't hear anything.

06:32.924 --> 06:34.525
No, you didn't hear anything, no.

06:34.545 --> 06:35.606
BAU BAU!

06:35.726 --> 06:38.127
BAU BAU!

06:39.028 --> 06:43.670
Well, let's have a very, very happy start to our New Year, Ruffians.

06:45.444 --> 06:51.770
Maybe, you know, your New Year's resolution is to wake up every day for FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:51.790 --> 06:52.891
That would be pretty cool.

06:52.911 --> 06:57.595
That would be cool, but just so there's no misunderstanding.

06:57.695 --> 06:59.136
No misunderstandings!

06:59.196 --> 07:06.322
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

07:06.903 --> 07:08.024
AKA FUWAMOCO!

07:08.384 --> 07:10.246
And it's hosted by us.

07:10.846 --> 07:12.367
FUWAMOCO!

07:12.387 --> 07:18.673
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

07:19.433 --> 07:28.181
So, a way to start on the right paw is to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

07:28.721 --> 07:31.944
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

07:32.324 --> 07:36.368
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:36.488 --> 07:37.228
BAU BAU!

07:38.529 --> 07:38.970
Why?

07:41.532 --> 07:43.834
Well, it's a new year.

07:44.074 --> 07:44.574
New year?

07:44.594 --> 07:48.357
Do we have something new and exciting, Moco-chan?

07:48.477 --> 07:51.199
New year, new pero sighting.

07:51.219 --> 07:52.961
Pero sighting?

07:52.981 --> 07:54.982
Do we have to start the new year this way?

07:55.002 --> 07:58.945
I don't know.

08:00.106 --> 08:05.791
Ruffians submitted it, so... I mean, we are asking for sightings of peros, so...

08:07.213 --> 08:08.674
Is it a good Pero Sighting?

08:28.158 --> 08:31.519
If you look at the left side and the right side of the picture, it's good.

08:31.739 --> 08:36.560
Well, we love mitarashi dango, so it's good in that way.

08:37.260 --> 08:42.722
I'll have the one on the left and Moco-chan, you can have the one on the right.

08:43.242 --> 08:48.903
Ruffians, I think maybe it's for the best if you don't eat the one in the middle.

08:53.624 --> 08:59.468
I don't want to think too hard about what my eyes are seeing and what my brain is feeling.

09:00.048 --> 09:03.491
This is just a lot going on there.

09:03.631 --> 09:08.994
Instead, I'm just going to look at how delicious the other dango looks right there.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.576
How does it look?

09:11.836 --> 09:14.038
Pero has his bones.

09:18.783 --> 09:24.185
But, you know, I feel like this mitarashi dango here looks so delicious.

09:24.345 --> 09:30.848
That maybe we might get a little bit carried away and poke ourselves there.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.849
We gotta be careful, you know!

09:32.909 --> 09:34.829
Ruffians, have you had mitarashi dango before?

09:34.889 --> 09:35.630
It's not marshmallows.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.453
No, not marshmallows.

09:42.493 --> 09:49.518
Mitarashi dango is like a... Mitarashi sauce is like a sweet, but savory sweet sauce-based sauce.

09:49.799 --> 09:53.782
It might take a little bit of time to get used to, but it's really yummy.

09:53.922 --> 09:57.564
And then you have the dango, it's kind of like mochi, but not.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.366
It's dango.

10:00.066 --> 10:00.627
It's different.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.608
It's very yummy, though.

10:01.808 --> 10:02.688
Very yummy?

10:02.989 --> 10:03.689
My favorite.

10:03.929 --> 10:08.793
But you know, let's make sure to have lots of yummy food this New Year season, too!

10:10.691 --> 10:14.433
I might have had a lot of yummy food during the holidays too.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.213
Christmas.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.353
But now it's New Year.

10:16.714 --> 10:18.214
So... New Year food.

10:18.234 --> 10:19.675
Another excuse for yummy food, huh?

10:20.075 --> 10:23.396
BAU BAU!

10:23.557 --> 10:25.277
Let's just forget about Peronia.

10:25.677 --> 10:27.558
No nasties in the New Year.

10:27.758 --> 10:27.938
No!

10:29.719 --> 10:31.480
BAU BAU!

10:33.901 --> 10:35.422
Now I'm extra hungry.

10:35.742 --> 10:38.363
Well, speaking of the New Year...

10:39.082 --> 10:39.882
Oh!

10:40.122 --> 10:41.403
Wow, ruffians.

10:42.343 --> 10:45.644
Like we said, it's now officially the new year everywhere!

10:45.804 --> 10:48.505
New year everywhere, you know?

10:48.705 --> 10:54.846
And so, it's the season to welcome the year with... Boys Pudge!

10:54.866 --> 10:57.287
BAU BAU!

10:57.407 --> 11:03.909
I think, you know, ruffians, you enjoyed our end of the year holiday theme, right?

11:06.308 --> 11:12.753
Well, I think it was a bit heart-pumping for you, just like it was for us, right?

11:13.753 --> 11:21.559
Yeah, well, now this is the perfect time to listen to the beginning of the year holiday voice chat too, you know?

11:21.659 --> 11:21.879
Right?

11:21.899 --> 11:27.283
You know, it's a fun time of year, lots to do together, you know?

11:27.803 --> 11:33.327
Cooking, maybe some cleaning, or even just, you know, taking it

11:33.957 --> 11:38.619
Easy together, maybe watching anime, playing games, those kind of things.

11:38.759 --> 11:46.703
Maybe you'll have to listen to our beginning of the year voice packs to find out.

11:57.108 --> 12:01.169
I can't wait for the English and Japanese versions!

12:16.653 --> 12:17.754
It was a lot of fun.

12:17.794 --> 12:23.318
We had a lot of fun, you know, so we hope that you enjoyed them just as much as we did.

12:23.978 --> 12:25.559
BAU BAU!

12:25.579 --> 12:27.300
Thank you, our friends!

12:27.320 --> 12:29.282
Speaking of Japanese...

12:40.874 --> 12:45.477
We had a bit of fun these past few days, Ruffians, you know.

12:45.797 --> 12:59.707
Actually, as a part of some of the end-of-the-year festivities, we were invited to participate in the Yukuhoro Kuruhoro New Year's programming during the Toridaka Taisho!

12:59.727 --> 13:01.488
Toridaka Taisho!

13:01.588 --> 13:07.852
You know, we participated along with our senpai, and we watched a bunch of the best moments of the year for hololive!

13:09.293 --> 13:14.139
You know, the clip that was crowned the Grand Prix.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.464
It was something else, huh?

13:17.644 --> 13:18.986
Something else.

13:19.346 --> 13:20.487
A lot of chaos.

13:20.507 --> 13:22.470
A lot of amazing clips, right!

13:22.710 --> 13:24.332
NPC Nenechi.

13:25.013 --> 13:25.434
Right.

13:26.460 --> 13:38.771
Yeah, but you know, not just the Toredaka Taisho group, we also formed into AyaHobomi to the 3D Toon New Future!

13:38.991 --> 13:40.472
I wasn't envious, no.

13:40.772 --> 13:41.293
Right!

13:41.653 --> 13:45.877
We all got to eat Osechi, a traditional Japanese New Year's food.

13:46.057 --> 13:47.058
Yeah, a bit fancy.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.060
Yeah, we had kamaboko fish cakes,

13:51.781 --> 13:53.762
Black beans.

13:53.782 --> 13:55.182
Kazunoko.

13:55.222 --> 13:55.523
Kazunoko.

13:55.563 --> 13:55.923
Kazunoko.

13:55.943 --> 13:56.523
Kazunoko.

13:56.543 --> 13:57.303
Kazunoko.

13:57.343 --> 13:57.903
Kazunoko.

13:58.023 --> 13:58.384
Kazunoko.

13:58.404 --> 13:58.844
Kazunoko.

13:58.884 --> 13:59.784
Kazunoko.

13:59.804 --> 14:00.384
Kazunoko.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.065
Kazunoko.

14:11.148 --> 14:12.889
We're really happy.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.329
It was definitely a fun start to the new year!

14:16.410 --> 14:23.972
We're just really thankful to be able to participate on these programs and we hope that we'll get invited more in the future too!

14:24.192 --> 14:24.992
BAU BAU!

14:28.633 --> 14:30.334
Although, I still want to try.

14:30.354 --> 14:37.616
Because I talked about trying ikura, and kazunoko, and umibudo.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.136
All at once!

14:39.236 --> 14:40.936
Sea grapes.

14:41.237 --> 14:41.757
Sea grapes.

14:41.837 --> 14:42.537
Let's call it that.

14:44.818 --> 14:48.639
You know, you want ASMR, right, ruffians?

14:49.179 --> 14:49.819
What about it?

14:51.219 --> 14:52.380
That type of ASMR.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.260
That's what Fubuki-senpai was suggesting, right?

14:55.280 --> 14:56.701
Because they all sound very...

14:57.725 --> 14:58.205
Popping.

14:58.365 --> 14:58.845
Popping.

14:59.506 --> 15:01.406
Popping seafood.

15:03.167 --> 15:04.087
Huh?

15:04.127 --> 15:04.547
Yes!

15:04.607 --> 15:09.249
I was expecting you to say no!

15:10.929 --> 15:12.170
Seafood ASMR?

15:14.319 --> 15:14.999
You're weird.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.703
BAU BAU!

15:21.143 --> 15:26.947
You know, we had a lot of New Year's fun, but with the New Year's also comes some new things, too.

15:26.967 --> 15:32.691
And over at the hololive reddit, there's been some updates.

15:32.871 --> 15:34.192
Some changes.

15:34.252 --> 15:35.593
The changes, yeah.

15:35.993 --> 15:43.238
You know, now, ruffians, you can select us and the other advent members as your OSHA icons!

15:43.658 --> 15:45.119
You know, I don't really get it.

15:45.660 --> 15:50.884
Apparently, it's a bit tricky to select both of us as your... A flair?

15:51.004 --> 15:54.087
Not flair senpai, but a flair.

15:54.227 --> 15:55.108
Oshi-aikon.

15:55.748 --> 15:56.489
Is it different?

15:57.430 --> 15:57.970
Oshi-aikon.

15:57.990 --> 15:58.751
Let's go with that.

15:58.851 --> 15:59.812
Okay.

16:00.112 --> 16:07.038
But apparently, to be able to have both of us as your oshi-aikon, you have to select Yagoo-san first.

16:07.579 --> 16:10.261
And then, you can select both of us.

16:11.297 --> 16:15.860
I don't really get it, but there's some kind of ruffians that will definitely help you, okay?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.262
I wonder why you have to ask Yago-san for permission first.

16:20.683 --> 16:21.223
I don't know!

16:21.844 --> 16:23.985
You'll have to ask him, okay?

16:24.605 --> 16:27.767
But we hope that you'll pick us as your ushi on Reddit too!

16:27.847 --> 16:30.629
I definitely, definitely never notice them.

16:30.949 --> 16:31.250
Why?

16:31.370 --> 16:33.091
Never, ever looking.

16:33.111 --> 16:36.413
No, definitely not.

16:36.913 --> 16:41.576
Then Biboo and Hana-senpai?

16:42.377 --> 16:44.478
When's FUWAMOCO's turn?

16:45.781 --> 16:46.122
Right?

16:47.703 --> 16:51.947
But now, FUWAMOCO, we have BAU BAU stickers by me too!

16:52.107 --> 16:57.232
I don't know if it's any different, but now maybe you can notice when it's actually us.

16:57.853 --> 16:59.695
When we respond to your comment.

17:01.371 --> 17:03.953
No, it's not a fake FUWAMOCO.

17:04.113 --> 17:05.655
No, it's ice.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.897
It's FUWAMOCO, Fuwawa, and Mococo.

17:08.957 --> 17:10.999
No fake FUWAMOCO.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.701
It's ice.

17:13.941 --> 17:23.249
We hope to be able to have even more fun here on Reddit and, you know, enjoy hololive all together over there in 2024 too!

17:23.409 --> 17:24.410
I don't get it too.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.012
But, don't think, just jump.

17:27.632 --> 17:27.952
BAU BAU!

17:33.092 --> 17:41.559
Well, Ruffians, you know the new year, it's a time for maybe channeling luck?

17:42.040 --> 17:43.621
Yeah, noon to noon.

17:44.121 --> 17:53.169
And, well, Ruffians, I was wondering, do you have anything particularly lucky that brings you good luck throughout the day?

17:53.949 --> 17:54.390
You know,

17:56.329 --> 18:02.231
A special mug or a necklace or maybe a shirt.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.791
Some sort of lucky item.

18:04.332 --> 18:06.252
Those kind of things.

18:07.613 --> 18:08.473
Not at all!

18:08.493 --> 18:11.514
FUWAMOCO is your lucky charm!

18:12.234 --> 18:14.595
You say that, it's gonna make us blush.

18:15.215 --> 18:15.915
What are you doing?

18:15.935 --> 18:16.595
It's the morning.

18:16.635 --> 18:19.396
Wristwatch!

18:21.417 --> 18:24.538
I guess ruffians don't really have lucky items.

18:24.558 --> 18:25.218
We're the only...

18:26.638 --> 18:30.002
Wow, I couldn't have given you other gifts, huh?

18:30.062 --> 18:35.488
Well, though, actually, Fuwawa me, I have something like that!

18:37.546 --> 18:47.294
I never said anything, but actually, a while ago, I came across a shirt that brought me a lot of luck.

18:47.435 --> 18:47.975
A shirt!

18:47.995 --> 18:48.656
A shirt!

18:49.196 --> 18:49.857
Is it Mococo?

18:49.937 --> 18:50.237
No!

18:50.257 --> 18:51.018
I am not a shirt!

18:51.058 --> 18:52.039
You're not a shirt?

18:52.139 --> 18:52.899
I'm Mococo!

18:53.580 --> 18:56.082
Well, the story is, you know, one day,

18:59.645 --> 19:05.086
We were looking through some previously loved clothes in the Northwest Passage.

19:05.706 --> 19:12.168
And randomly, I came across a shirt that had Gura-senpai on it!

19:12.628 --> 19:13.128
Why?

19:13.288 --> 19:13.988
Why?

19:14.368 --> 19:15.128
Pretty lucky.

19:15.149 --> 19:16.029
Why?

19:16.509 --> 19:25.791
Ever since then, you know, whenever I kind of wanted extra good luck before, you know, like, auditions or something like that, you know,

19:26.903 --> 19:35.849
Even debut, I wore it as a pajama shirt the night before, and then that way, I could get some extra love.

19:36.449 --> 19:39.131
Ruffians, you know what?

19:39.571 --> 19:40.672
I think it worked!

19:41.012 --> 19:42.713
Kuro-senpai's luck!

19:43.513 --> 19:55.421
You know, it's a very special lucky item of mine that has helped give me a little power during times where I really needed it, so I'm very thankful.

19:57.849 --> 19:59.952
Would you like something like that too, ruffians?

20:00.032 --> 20:04.099
Head pads!

20:04.439 --> 20:07.183
If you don't wash it.

20:07.223 --> 20:07.684
I wash it.

20:12.614 --> 20:13.935
That sounded suspicious.

20:14.055 --> 20:19.501
I do wash it, I do wash it.

20:19.721 --> 20:21.182
That's normal, okay?

20:21.202 --> 20:23.664
That sounded very suspicious though.

20:23.925 --> 20:33.093
But you know, I really hope that maybe there's still some more luck attached to it.

20:34.054 --> 20:36.216
If I wear it some more, maybe...

20:38.945 --> 20:42.071
Gura-senpai morning!

20:42.091 --> 20:46.940
After all, one of our goals this year is to get to know our senpai better too, right?

20:48.419 --> 20:52.341
Now hopefully, now that we're out of the holiday time, maybe we'll have some more time.

20:52.361 --> 20:52.801
Right!

20:52.861 --> 20:54.962
Do some more collabs.

20:55.562 --> 20:57.103
BAU BAU!

20:57.123 --> 21:01.245
I hope ruffians, you can find your lucky items.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.446
BAU BAU!

21:03.886 --> 21:11.210
Well, we actually have some FUWAMOCO scoops from some ruffians.

21:11.510 --> 21:15.032
Thank you for the very good channels, ruffians.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.973
Our first group, yeah!

21:18.013 --> 21:24.228
Our first group for today we have... Ruffians.

21:25.578 --> 21:26.859
Did you hear about this?

21:28.199 --> 21:38.645
Just the other day, Kiara-senpai and Ina-senpai did a special stream where they created their own interpretation of some casual clothing outfits for everyone.

21:38.785 --> 21:39.785
It was so cute!

21:40.386 --> 21:41.846
What do you think, ruffians?

21:42.427 --> 21:43.327
You were there!

21:43.347 --> 21:46.629
Did you enjoy the designs?

21:46.749 --> 21:49.110
They were all so cute!

21:51.271 --> 21:56.154
You know, it really, really showcased Kiara-senpai, Ina-senpai's personality.

21:56.234 --> 21:56.735
Right!

21:56.755 --> 21:57.775
It's wonderful too.

21:58.316 --> 21:58.956
Yeah.

21:59.437 --> 22:06.902
However though, when it came to Shiori's design, she kinda had something to say.

22:06.922 --> 22:07.002
Yeah.

22:10.304 --> 22:20.351
She wasn't too impressed with, you know, her tummy showing and kinda called Moco-chan, uh, shameless for showing hers.

22:21.926 --> 22:23.687
Moco-chan, do you have anything to say?

22:23.707 --> 22:26.369
Shiori.

22:27.689 --> 22:28.610
Shiori!

22:29.550 --> 22:30.591
You know me.

22:31.932 --> 22:33.313
I'm not shameless!

22:34.393 --> 22:47.101
You know, I... I just... tend to get a bit quiet sometimes, so... You know, keeping a tummy cool makes it a happy tummy, right?

22:50.262 --> 22:50.783
Ruffians!

22:51.994 --> 22:53.175
You agree, right?

22:53.715 --> 22:55.136
That sounds like an excuse.

22:55.357 --> 22:55.977
No!

22:56.177 --> 22:58.079
I'm not shameless, okay?

22:58.099 --> 23:00.100
That sounds like an excuse, yeah.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.362
It's out of practicality.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.727
It doesn't matter because... My tummy is cute, right?

23:15.792 --> 23:17.513
So it's okay, right?

23:22.429 --> 23:24.071
It's not seamless, okay?

23:24.291 --> 23:25.192
It's practical.

23:26.413 --> 23:29.235
No, I think it's seamless.

23:29.475 --> 23:30.416
No!

23:31.137 --> 23:34.640
My own system.

23:35.561 --> 23:37.362
Moco-chan, what do you propose?

23:38.263 --> 23:40.945
I think Shiori should apologize.

23:41.906 --> 23:42.246
Shiori!

23:42.306 --> 23:46.030
I'm waiting for your apology, Shiori!

23:47.771 --> 23:49.373
BAU BAU!

23:51.032 --> 23:52.792
Thank you for the scoop, Ruffians.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.213
Thank you for telling me about the horrible things Shiori said.

23:56.814 --> 23:58.234
Ah, that's terrible.

23:58.774 --> 23:59.674
That's rough.

24:00.555 --> 24:01.155
Wow.

24:01.635 --> 24:04.436
There's been some more scoops, too.

24:04.696 --> 24:05.716
Hopefully better ones.

24:05.796 --> 24:07.356
Hopefully better, yeah.

24:07.897 --> 24:08.897
Wow, wow.

24:09.317 --> 24:15.339
I think there was a senpai that had some extra, extra special luck recently.

24:15.919 --> 24:17.999
Because... Wow.

24:18.680 --> 24:19.960
Hekora-senpai!

24:23.979 --> 24:27.371
She had some very good luck betting on horses.

24:29.088 --> 24:30.609
Arima Kimi.

24:30.629 --> 24:32.570
Really famous horse races in Japan.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.931
And you know what happened over Christmas?

24:35.451 --> 24:38.832
And I think a number of senpai decided to place some bets on horses today.

24:38.993 --> 24:43.154
I was a bit confused as to what senpai was doing.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.175
But Pekora senpai, she won big!

24:45.515 --> 24:48.477
She won over a million yen, over $10,000 American!

24:54.773 --> 24:56.434
That's pretty... That's pretty weird.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.375
That's amazing, right?

24:57.415 --> 24:58.056
That's amazing, right?

24:58.076 --> 24:58.576
That's amazing, right?

24:58.596 --> 24:59.017
That's amazing, right?

24:59.037 --> 24:59.617
That's amazing, right?

24:59.677 --> 25:00.298
That's amazing, right?

25:00.318 --> 25:00.858
That's amazing, right?

25:00.878 --> 25:01.439
That's amazing, right?

25:01.459 --> 25:02.019
That's amazing, right?

25:02.039 --> 25:02.680
That's amazing, right?

25:02.700 --> 25:03.380
That's amazing, right?

25:03.400 --> 25:04.461
That's amazing, right?

25:04.501 --> 25:05.222
That's amazing, right?

25:05.242 --> 25:06.142
That's amazing, right?

25:06.162 --> 25:07.123
That's amazing, right?

25:07.143 --> 25:07.684
That's amazing, right?

25:07.724 --> 25:08.444
That's amazing, right?

25:08.464 --> 25:09.085
That's amazing, right?

25:09.105 --> 25:09.906
That's amazing, right?

25:09.926 --> 25:10.406
That's amazing, right?

25:10.426 --> 25:10.906
That's amazing, right?

25:10.926 --> 25:11.447
That's amazing, right?

25:11.467 --> 25:12.468
That's amazing, right?

25:12.808 --> 25:13.408
That's amazing, right?

25:13.448 --> 25:13.929
That's amazing, right?

25:13.949 --> 25:14.569
That's amazing, right?

25:14.589 --> 25:15.230
That's amazing, right?

25:15.250 --> 25:16.251
That's amazing, right?

25:16.271 --> 25:17.131
That's amazing, right?

25:17.152 --> 25:17.812
That's amazing, right?

25:17.832 --> 25:18.453
That's amazing, right?

25:18.473 --> 25:19.373
That's amazing, right?

25:19.453 --> 25:20.714
That's amazing, right?

25:20.734 --> 25:21.195
That's amazing, right?

25:21.215 --> 25:22.736
That's amazing, right?

25:22.756 --> 25:23.357
That's amazing, right

25:24.218 --> 25:27.046
She probably used all of 2024's luck too high.

25:27.086 --> 25:27.487
Probably.

25:27.507 --> 25:29.352
Why did you use the ruffians?

25:30.447 --> 25:32.488
I don't know, I wonder about these things.

25:32.848 --> 25:33.229
I see.

25:33.249 --> 25:37.131
Maybe not.

25:37.651 --> 25:43.354
But you know, Mio-senpai was talking about buying New Year's fortune tickets for us too.

25:43.414 --> 25:43.734
Right!

25:43.754 --> 25:45.155
So we were happy.

25:45.535 --> 25:51.599
We were happy but... I think Mio-senpai could say, Oh, I'll do anything with FUWAMOCO and we'd be happy.

25:51.879 --> 25:57.222
But yeah, you know, but more than fortune tickets, I think, you know, we just wanna

25:57.802 --> 25:58.162
BAU BAU!

25:58.182 --> 25:58.362
BAU BAU!

25:58.442 --> 25:59.823
It's that time of the week.

25:59.863 --> 26:01.483
It's a new year!

26:01.623 --> 26:03.304
A new week and a new challenge!

26:03.324 --> 26:03.544
Right!

26:27.210 --> 26:27.690
Right!

26:30.351 --> 26:40.115
So, this week too, Moco-chan's gonna do her best to challenge and overcome her fear of natto!

26:40.296 --> 26:42.516
Yeah, we've been at this for a while.

26:42.536 --> 26:50.780
Ruffians, you know that natto is a type of breakfast food in Japan that consists of fermented soybeans.

26:51.160 --> 26:55.642
It's really healthy for you, but it's kind of something else.

26:57.670 --> 27:00.812
Mococo-chan, you did really well with the sesame oil last time.

27:01.152 --> 27:01.352
I did!

27:01.373 --> 27:01.653
I did!

27:01.793 --> 27:03.134
I've been doing well!

27:03.194 --> 27:07.436
That's why this time, I decided to go very minimal.

27:08.196 --> 27:09.857
Very minimal.

27:10.058 --> 27:13.600
Do things the way that we started them.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.541
Because it's the start of a new year, right?

27:15.561 --> 27:17.922
Start of a new year, you know?

27:18.462 --> 27:19.143
And I think...

27:20.034 --> 27:25.857
Maybe Moco-chan, maybe this is more of like a... You kinda gotta just convince yourself that you can eat them!

27:26.997 --> 27:29.018
It's a part of the heart.

27:29.679 --> 27:33.240
My heart has been wrong and that's why I haven't been able to eat it.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.401
Is that what you're saying?

27:34.721 --> 27:37.142
Well, that could be one thing.

27:38.343 --> 27:39.804
Okay, Moco-chan, you ready?

27:39.944 --> 27:42.845
Okay, I guess.

27:43.305 --> 27:44.966
Do you have my favorite chopsticks?

27:45.466 --> 27:45.606
No.

27:48.502 --> 27:51.443
It's another part you have to get over, Moco-chan.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.144
Can I use chopsticks?

27:53.204 --> 27:53.784
Is that okay?

27:53.804 --> 27:53.964
Yeah.

27:54.884 --> 27:55.785
Yeah.

27:56.805 --> 27:57.285
I'm allowed.

27:57.325 --> 27:58.506
I don't have to use my hands.

27:58.526 --> 27:58.566
No.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.287
Okay, Moco-chan!

28:03.407 --> 28:04.127
Thank you!

28:04.167 --> 28:05.908
Thank you!

28:07.068 --> 28:07.849
The natto.

28:09.269 --> 28:11.110
It looks very... A little bit different.

28:11.250 --> 28:14.411
A bit different.

28:15.511 --> 28:16.892
It doesn't smell that much, does it?

28:17.996 --> 28:19.797
I... I don't know.

28:19.817 --> 28:23.118
I'm sort of... I'm sort of confident today, I think.

28:23.158 --> 28:24.618
You know, it's New Year.

28:25.099 --> 28:26.759
New life.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.620
Mouthful you think.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.361
Okay, Moco-chan.

28:31.401 --> 28:37.263
First, let's say thank you to the FUWAMOZUKONCHIGI who tried to make this okay.

28:37.603 --> 28:38.544
Itadakimasu!

28:38.584 --> 28:40.964
Thank you very much!

28:43.857 --> 28:47.979
I don't smell it today, maybe that means my allergies is worse.

28:48.419 --> 28:48.679
Worse?

28:49.080 --> 28:49.640
Positive.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.121
Allergies are worse!

28:51.421 --> 28:52.481
BAU BAU!

28:52.541 --> 28:54.903
Okay, well, let's try it!

28:54.963 --> 28:56.764
Different kind of energy today, huh?

28:56.784 --> 28:58.124
It's a bit different, huh?

28:58.184 --> 28:58.524
Yeah.

28:58.624 --> 29:00.165
Okay, let's try it.

29:00.225 --> 29:05.588
Is this a different... a different... not flavor, but... No, it's the same as always.

29:05.668 --> 29:06.769
Is it the same as always?

29:06.789 --> 29:08.209
Yeah, you just have to believe.

29:08.229 --> 29:09.950
Okay, I'll have to believe, okay.

29:09.970 --> 29:13.012
Okay, Moco-chan, make sure you take a big...

29:14.359 --> 29:16.260
Big, big, big, big, big one.

29:16.920 --> 29:17.200
Okay.

29:17.260 --> 29:17.820
It's a big one.

29:17.860 --> 29:18.020
Yeah.

29:18.080 --> 29:18.360
Okay.

29:18.380 --> 29:18.661
Okay.

29:18.741 --> 29:19.741
Oh my goodness.

29:20.021 --> 29:30.144
Can you believe it?

29:36.626 --> 29:37.927
Can you believe it?

29:54.025 --> 29:55.526
BAU BAU!

29:55.606 --> 29:56.046
Ruffians.

29:56.126 --> 30:00.449
Ruffians.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.851
There's no natto.

30:05.211 --> 30:05.851
Confession.

30:07.813 --> 30:08.753
It was forgotten.

30:10.954 --> 30:11.595
We're out of natto.

30:11.615 --> 30:11.935
BAU BAU!

30:11.975 --> 30:13.336
You didn't do it!

30:21.199 --> 30:24.182
It was the most delicious air natto ever.

30:24.202 --> 30:28.246
We're out of natto.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.349
We're out of natto.

30:31.509 --> 30:35.413
And we realized 30 seconds before starting.

30:36.564 --> 30:38.646
BAU BAU!

30:39.527 --> 30:42.890
We're starting the year on a good paw, right?

30:43.110 --> 30:44.532
Right!

30:45.152 --> 30:50.397
That was a different kind of attempt today, but you were tricked!

30:53.590 --> 30:55.492
Is that a challenge?

30:56.333 --> 30:58.535
Was it a challenge, Moco-chan?

31:10.247 --> 31:12.149
Pulling the ruffians.

31:13.931 --> 31:16.474
I didn't think you would be pulled by the ruffians.

31:17.215 --> 31:19.277
I'm a bit disappointed.

31:21.219 --> 31:24.722
Well, I'd say first challenge of the year succeeded.

31:35.137 --> 31:37.378
Is that how it sounds usually?

31:37.458 --> 31:38.459
I don't think so, huh?

31:38.619 --> 31:40.219
It's so easy, huh?

31:40.239 --> 31:50.584
Ruffians, you know it's a new year, so let's make sure to do our best and challenge ourselves in new areas too, okay?

31:51.164 --> 31:53.505
And that will be continued.

31:54.165 --> 31:54.746
Next week.

31:54.786 --> 31:55.346
Next week.

31:55.466 --> 31:57.488
When we actually have natto.

31:57.788 --> 31:58.048
Yeah.

31:58.288 --> 31:59.549
Kyou wa ea natto deshita.

31:59.589 --> 32:00.430
Ea natto deshita.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.410
Oishikatta!

32:01.430 --> 32:03.572
BAU BAU!

32:04.833 --> 32:05.834
BAU BAU!

32:05.974 --> 32:07.895
I'm continuing on!

32:08.676 --> 32:11.338
The first Doggie of the Day?

32:11.398 --> 32:13.319
Oh, it doesn't make it the doggy of the year.

32:13.499 --> 32:13.699
No.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.581
It's the first Doggie of the Day of the year.

32:17.362 --> 32:19.523
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day of the year is!

32:20.724 --> 32:22.165
The Doggie of the Day of the year is...

32:23.584 --> 32:27.545
It's... Gutierrez!

32:27.645 --> 32:29.666
Gutierrez!

32:29.706 --> 32:30.266
BAU BAU!

32:30.306 --> 32:33.187
I feel like he's looking into my soul.

32:33.207 --> 32:38.209
Oh, well, you know Gutierrez.

32:38.229 --> 32:39.269
He's a good boy.

32:39.289 --> 32:40.730
Good bad manners.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.131
What do you think of that, Moco-chan?

32:46.231 --> 32:51.153
Well... I feel like you can see all of my thoughts in my head, so...

32:52.645 --> 32:53.665
Maybe I'll forgive him.

32:53.685 --> 32:56.546
Okay, yeah.

32:56.606 --> 32:58.106
You know, he's doing his best.

32:59.086 --> 33:04.007
Apparently, you know, this is his I'm-not-a-fan-of-fireworks face.

33:04.067 --> 33:04.447
Yeah.

33:04.967 --> 33:05.787
I get that.

33:05.907 --> 33:17.409
I like fireworks, but you know, sometimes it can be a bit surprising and then I look like... How does he BAU BAU?

33:17.809 --> 33:18.369
I think...

33:22.580 --> 33:28.985
If it's the I'm not a fan of fireworks time, then maybe it's like... BAU BAU!

33:29.025 --> 33:30.546
BAU BAU!

33:30.586 --> 33:31.967
BAU BAU!

33:32.027 --> 33:32.988
BAU BAU!

33:33.208 --> 33:33.668
BAU BAU!

33:33.688 --> 33:35.349
BAU BAU!

33:35.369 --> 33:38.051
BAU BAU!

33:38.452 --> 33:38.932
BAU BAU!

33:39.012 --> 33:40.493
BAU BAU!

33:40.673 --> 33:41.814
I think that's exactly it.

33:43.984 --> 33:44.785
This is bad.

33:45.265 --> 33:48.467
Good tears is on a journey of self-growth.

33:48.667 --> 33:55.390
You know, he has good intentions and is a good boy, but sometimes makes mistakes too.

33:55.410 --> 33:59.732
Yeah, you know, that's just how things are sometimes.

34:00.313 --> 34:02.113
No such thing as a perfect puppy.

34:03.434 --> 34:05.735
Yeah, but I have a good feeling, you know.

34:06.056 --> 34:07.136
A new year!

34:07.416 --> 34:09.678
A new good year!

34:09.858 --> 34:11.919
BAU BAU!

34:11.939 --> 34:12.019
Cute.

34:12.540 --> 34:19.243
Well, Ruffians, you're still going out for walks, right?

34:19.644 --> 34:22.145
Well, here is the first walk of the day of the year.

34:22.926 --> 34:23.766
De-den!

34:29.545 --> 34:31.866
Wonderful Comiket day!

34:31.886 --> 34:32.526
Beautiful.

34:33.546 --> 34:35.106
Oh, the winter sun.

34:35.386 --> 34:39.447
And you got Icomochi-mama's FUWAMOCO goods!

34:39.707 --> 34:40.927
BAU BAU!

34:40.987 --> 34:42.828
Very, very cute!

34:43.288 --> 34:46.349
We're so glad you had a lot of fun.

34:46.389 --> 34:51.690
Yeah, but now it's time to rest after a surely very busy Comiket.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.130
Right.

34:52.270 --> 34:53.030
Time to rest.

34:53.230 --> 34:54.670
Time to enjoy.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.031
Enjoy your treasures, your spoils.

34:57.071 --> 34:57.731
Put your feet up.

34:58.271 --> 34:59.051
BAU BAU!

34:59.091 --> 35:05.014
Next we have our first question of the day of the year.

35:15.661 --> 35:17.902
De-den!

35:17.982 --> 35:19.823
BAU BAU!

35:19.903 --> 35:20.563
Good question.

35:20.583 --> 35:20.863
Ruffians.

35:20.883 --> 35:21.164
Ruffians!

35:43.041 --> 35:47.404
Maybe it's good to get dis- uh, to be ready to get disappointed.

35:47.464 --> 35:48.745
It's good to be disappointed!

35:48.885 --> 35:51.086
Is that what you wanted to say?

35:51.106 --> 35:51.146
No!

35:51.566 --> 36:03.434
Get ready to be disappointed because, um, at least, you know, my thought is, on the first playthrough of the game, you know, I kind of want to have the best experience, right?

36:04.174 --> 36:04.535
Right?

36:05.755 --> 36:09.498
And sometimes, maybe, Fuwawa might not pick-

36:10.287 --> 36:14.070
The best heroine to go with to have the best experience of the game.

36:14.090 --> 36:20.655
So, I kind of searched up online what the recommended playthrough order is.

36:21.576 --> 36:31.804
And, I will, even if the heroine I'm most interested in, if she's in the last, the last one to play, I still follow the recommendations.

36:33.765 --> 36:35.267
Isn't that the worst ruffians?

36:35.647 --> 36:36.668
That's cheating!

36:38.063 --> 36:44.008
But I feel like the developers, they want me to have the best experience, right?

36:44.749 --> 36:45.149
Same!

36:45.629 --> 36:47.591
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

36:48.412 --> 36:50.473
Yeah.

36:50.493 --> 36:51.794
Oh, you go with least interested?

36:52.055 --> 36:55.878
But then what if you're like, oh, I really don't like her, and then you're like, this game, mm-mm.

36:56.458 --> 36:56.718
Right?

36:56.738 --> 36:58.340
That would be kind of sad, so.

36:59.488 --> 37:03.191
But I feel like, generally, this method hasn't failed me yet.

37:03.631 --> 37:10.677
You know, even for Chihuahua, I did that, and I was definitely very glad I did because, you know, Mochi!

37:10.737 --> 37:11.558
Mochi!

37:11.578 --> 37:11.878
Hi!

37:12.018 --> 37:13.059
Our favorite!

37:13.379 --> 37:18.283
You know, she was the final rule, and I feel like that was the perfect way to complete the game.

37:19.724 --> 37:20.645
It's important.

37:20.905 --> 37:21.506
Yeah.

37:21.606 --> 37:22.667
A lot of tears.

37:22.927 --> 37:24.628
BAU BAU!

37:24.688 --> 37:27.270
Thank you for the question!

37:27.710 --> 37:36.557
Thank you so much, ruffians, for all your Doggie of the Day, your scoops today, some great journalism, your questions, too.

37:37.377 --> 37:38.018
Headpats, too.

37:38.078 --> 37:39.359
Important part, right?

37:39.379 --> 37:40.720
No, headpats for the ruffians.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.441
Oh, headpats for the ruffians.

37:42.781 --> 37:43.342
And for Mococo.

37:46.123 --> 37:48.163
Thank you so much, ruffians!

37:48.664 --> 37:54.666
Please, please continue to support FUWAMOCO Morning in the new year in 2024.

37:54.726 --> 38:02.989
Here you know, FUWAMOCO Morning is going to always be a show that's made all together, so we hope you'll continue to feel that way, too!

38:03.489 --> 38:05.190
BAU BAU!

38:05.710 --> 38:09.391
Oh, well, for our next team, what do we have, Moco-chan?

38:09.591 --> 38:09.651
Wow.

38:11.767 --> 38:18.572
Ruffians, as you might know, our next stream was going to be our Advent.

38:18.632 --> 38:28.079
I think we're going to be having our New Year outfit reveals, but there's been a bit of a change of plans and our outfit reveal won't be able to happen tonight.

38:28.559 --> 38:32.422
But because of that, we made some changes to our schedule.

38:33.002 --> 38:33.323
Instead,

38:34.223 --> 38:38.786
We'll be doing a very comfy and cozy super chat.

38:39.306 --> 38:41.527
Is that okay, Ruffians?

38:41.607 --> 38:42.928
We'll spend some nice time.

38:43.308 --> 38:49.191
We hope that you'll be there with us.

38:49.531 --> 38:53.854
Just nice and cozy, filled with laughs.

38:54.274 --> 38:59.717
We hope that you'll really look forward to our new year outfit reveals in the very

39:00.484 --> 39:01.425
Near future.

39:01.625 --> 39:02.586
Soon, okay?

39:02.687 --> 39:03.407
Soon.

39:03.948 --> 39:07.152
It just means we get to look forward to it more, you know?

39:09.154 --> 39:10.295
BAU BAU!

39:11.356 --> 39:13.419
And our schedule!

39:14.099 --> 39:16.042
This is what our schedule looks like.

39:16.062 --> 39:20.807
I would like to let you know that there might be a number of schedule changes kinda out there.

39:21.227 --> 39:21.888
BAU BAU!

39:49.682 --> 39:57.348
Thank you so much, ruffians, for joining us today for the first FUWAMOCO Morning of 2024!

39:57.588 --> 40:04.073
I hope that you'll continue to wake up early and allow us to help you start the day off on the right paw.

40:04.393 --> 40:07.675
Protect your smile straight from the beginning of the morning!

40:09.236 --> 40:15.280
