05:06.960 --> 05:09.184
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:09.944 --> 05:13.285
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.425 --> 05:15.665
BAU BAU!

05:16.005 --> 05:20.006
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:20.046 --> 05:21.747
BAU BAU!

05:22.347 --> 05:25.227
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:25.608 --> 05:28.088
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.128 --> 05:29.909
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:29.949 --> 05:30.849
BAU BAU!

05:32.530 --> 05:37.314
And today, we're your hosts, the FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:37.995 --> 05:42.799
Thank you for joining us Ruffians today for our 51st episode!

05:42.859 --> 05:44.601
Can you say that okay?

05:44.641 --> 05:44.681
51st.

05:44.701 --> 05:44.861
51st.

05:44.901 --> 05:46.923
That's the right way, right?

05:46.963 --> 05:47.183
51st.

05:47.403 --> 05:48.444
The 51st episode!

05:48.484 --> 05:48.844
BAU BAU!

05:48.884 --> 05:50.186
BAU BAU!

05:50.226 --> 05:50.526
51st.

05:50.666 --> 05:53.529
Is that wrong?

05:54.489 --> 05:56.051
I don't know, somehow it sounds wrong.

05:56.071 --> 05:56.111
51st.

05:56.191 --> 05:56.311
51st.

06:02.924 --> 06:04.307
BAU BAU!

06:04.568 --> 06:05.811
51st on December 1st.

06:09.181 --> 06:21.906
Well, Ruffians, if you're just joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short-format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

06:22.046 --> 06:27.088
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:27.108 --> 06:32.490
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:33.750 --> 06:40.782
Please tweet all your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:41.243 --> 06:44.869
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:45.209 --> 06:47.112
BAU BAU!

06:49.318 --> 06:51.519
It kind of feels like, you know, it's a new month.

06:51.599 --> 06:54.100
Feels like a new week, but it's not.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.140
Are you warmed up for today?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.341
I'm warmed up.

06:57.381 --> 06:58.441
Do you feel a bit cold?

06:58.901 --> 06:59.561
I do, actually.

06:59.641 --> 07:00.462
I say I'm warmed up.

07:00.702 --> 07:07.404
I do feel a bit cold, a bit... Yeah, the bones don't quite move as smoothly.

07:07.984 --> 07:09.924
It's the somber first, you know?

07:10.425 --> 07:11.885
It's a bit chilly, huh?

07:12.065 --> 07:16.106
That is why Moco-chan did any Ruffians see Peroncino.

07:17.187 --> 07:17.627
Let's see!

07:18.832 --> 07:23.976
Do we have Pero Sighting?

07:26.178 --> 07:32.644
De-den!

07:32.744 --> 07:35.086
It is Pero.

07:35.126 --> 07:37.568
It's a Pero Sighting.

07:37.708 --> 07:43.193
At first I thought someone had broken into your very nice looking car there.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.706
It's just Pero.

07:47.346 --> 07:48.226
Yeah.

07:48.306 --> 07:48.886
Just Pero.

07:49.466 --> 07:52.428
It would be really awful if your window was smashed, you know?

07:52.928 --> 07:55.549
But that's not uncommon in the big cities, right?

07:55.949 --> 07:56.289
Right?

07:56.449 --> 08:00.650
Yeah, but... At least you know Pero is just sleeping.

08:01.091 --> 08:01.731
Just sleeping.

08:02.591 --> 08:08.033
I feel like he's the best when he's knocked out cold in a deep slumber, you know?

08:08.373 --> 08:08.593
Yeah.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.514
He almost kind of looks cute.

08:11.214 --> 08:13.095
Even a bit curly.

08:15.009 --> 08:17.390
Ruffians, do you think so too?

08:17.890 --> 08:18.831
Not so cool.

08:19.491 --> 08:20.452
Oh, like sleeping.

08:20.672 --> 08:26.555
Like a... Not cuddly, you agree!

08:27.415 --> 08:30.637
Well, that's interesting, but... You wouldn't go down, why?

08:31.558 --> 08:33.238
You would never cuddle Pero.

08:33.258 --> 08:35.720
Probably best for your own safety.

08:37.382 --> 08:41.624
But you know, I think it's probably best that you let him sleep undisturbed there, you know?

08:41.984 --> 08:44.445
You won't like him if you wake him up before he's ready.

08:45.925 --> 08:50.307
You know, he's kinda like Fuwawa when you accidentally wake him up.

08:55.289 --> 08:56.129
This way to the sink.

08:57.730 --> 09:06.091
Hopefully, though, he went on his way once he was rested up and, you know, there was no damage to your car or anything.

09:06.511 --> 09:11.172
Unless, you know, maybe you decided to chop him in there.

09:11.312 --> 09:11.572
What?

09:11.912 --> 09:12.612
Thank you!

09:12.732 --> 09:16.973
Thank you for letting us know that you saw Pero!

09:17.033 --> 09:18.693
He had a good sleep, yeah.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.634
But, you know, maybe he should be working a little bit harder, huh?

09:23.476 --> 09:23.817
BAU BAU!

09:30.580 --> 09:38.165
Well, you can't just be sleeping like that in other places, okay?

09:39.286 --> 09:44.229
Well, in happier news, we actually have something great!

09:44.729 --> 09:46.090
Ruffians!

09:46.651 --> 09:49.473
We've been breaking a lot of milestones recently.

09:49.553 --> 09:52.795
Almost every FUWAMOCO Morning, right?

09:52.815 --> 09:58.499
Well, this time, we hit 300,000 followers on Twitter!

10:01.581 --> 10:04.823
Thank you, Ruffians!

10:05.023 --> 10:06.224
BAU BAU!

10:06.264 --> 10:10.067
Thank you so much for making Twitter a fun place, Ruffians.

10:10.507 --> 10:14.910
We hope that you know that maybe we've been able to make it a fun place for you too.

10:15.090 --> 10:21.895
We hope that we can do more fun things, more Twitter spaces, and even some more silly tweets in the future.

10:22.596 --> 10:28.200
We love it when you respond to us and are just silly and kind with other Ruffians there.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.041
Thank you so much for making it a wonderful community.

10:33.662 --> 10:36.382
Please, please look forward to our next Rhyme Response 2!

10:36.442 --> 10:38.863
Can you do a Rhyme Response?

10:40.044 --> 10:41.104
This one.

10:42.064 --> 10:42.985
Go looking for it.

10:43.025 --> 10:46.866
You Ruffians, you respond to us, and we respond to you!

10:48.632 --> 10:49.393
Moco-chan.

11:09.318 --> 11:10.578
I wonder when that will be.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.018
Maybe soon.

11:12.519 --> 11:15.639
Well, no spoilers.

11:15.679 --> 11:16.639
Maybe soon.

11:16.939 --> 11:22.940
But here's to hoping that we're able to connect with you even more through the power of Twitter.

11:23.821 --> 11:26.241
BAU BAU!

11:26.681 --> 11:28.341
Not Howl and Hunt.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.161
Not today.

11:29.281 --> 11:31.222
Not tomorrow.

11:31.422 --> 11:34.362
We'll give you more warning before that.

11:34.562 --> 11:35.903
Not today!

11:36.283 --> 11:37.723
Not tomorrow!

11:38.612 --> 11:38.993
What is it?

11:39.394 --> 11:39.794
I don't know.

11:40.416 --> 11:40.496
Oh.

11:40.937 --> 11:41.458
Sometimes.

11:42.039 --> 11:43.041
BAU BAU!

11:43.161 --> 11:44.604
BAU BAU!

11:46.314 --> 11:50.277
Now there's been more updates on Ruffians!

11:50.878 --> 11:53.780
Actually, you know, we're still puppies.

11:54.260 --> 11:54.761
Still puppies.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.962
Puppies are new dogs.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.865
New dogs can do new tricks.

12:00.645 --> 12:04.468
And so, we tried something new, Ruffians!

12:05.529 --> 12:11.914
Finally, after a long time of trying and just not having enough time and kind of forgetting.

12:11.954 --> 12:14.076
Forgetting, maybe a bit of a lot of forgetting.

12:14.963 --> 12:18.745
We made our first post on Reddit!

12:18.825 --> 12:19.866
Yeah!

12:20.006 --> 12:21.747
Reddit, that's the website!

12:21.967 --> 12:23.408
On the hololive Reddit.

12:23.508 --> 12:25.730
There's us going BAU BAU BAU BAU!

12:26.170 --> 12:26.650
Yeah!

12:26.690 --> 12:29.592
Thank you for welcoming us there to Ruffians, okay?

12:29.612 --> 12:31.633
Redditor Ruffians!

12:31.693 --> 12:33.815
We know you so much!

12:33.855 --> 12:36.796
You know, we still don't really know too much about Reddit.

12:37.217 --> 12:42.060
We hope to be able to interact with you and other hololive fans there in the future!

12:42.660 --> 12:43.561
And you know, also see a

12:44.341 --> 12:46.744
Maybe what you're up to sometimes.

12:46.804 --> 12:48.726
While we're at it.

12:48.946 --> 12:51.469
So you might see us around there.

12:51.589 --> 12:53.191
Just maybe.

12:53.852 --> 12:54.813
Maybe making posts.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.034
Maybe commenting.

12:56.455 --> 13:01.020
But for Reddit we don't really get it still.

13:03.186 --> 13:11.936
Somehow Ruffians, thanks to your very warm welcome, it seems like we made it to all on Reddit.

13:12.436 --> 13:17.021
I don't know, but somehow we got almost a million views!

13:18.103 --> 13:19.044
It seems pretty crazy.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.226
One million people here!

13:21.286 --> 13:22.347
Let's BAU BAU!

13:22.408 --> 13:23.369
Right, right!

13:27.458 --> 13:32.260
Maybe that means we were some people's first exposure to Vtubers the other day.

13:32.360 --> 13:32.820
Maybe!

13:33.121 --> 13:34.261
That would be funny, huh?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.763
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

13:38.163 --> 13:43.025
Well, we hope that if we were their first, you know, that they thought we were neat.

13:43.706 --> 13:50.369
And, you know, if they didn't, well, we hope that they found something else on Reddit that they also thought was neat.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.149
Yeah!

13:51.189 --> 13:51.510
You know,

13:52.750 --> 13:55.832
Ruffians, we're going to do our best there.

13:56.432 --> 13:59.654
Hopefully we don't make any silly mistakes or anything.

13:59.774 --> 14:00.335
If we do, we do.

14:00.355 --> 14:01.175
Can we make reddit mistakes?

14:01.195 --> 14:01.615
I don't know.

14:01.816 --> 14:02.616
If we do, we do.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.618
We're looking forward to having lots of fun there too!

14:06.758 --> 14:08.179
BAU BAU!

14:10.117 --> 14:13.418
BAU BAU can't wait for episode 75 of FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:13.838 --> 14:15.279
Thank you for looking forward to it.

14:15.319 --> 14:16.879
You're gonna have to wait a little bit.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.401
BAU BAU!

14:20.421 --> 14:24.082
Well, there's been more exciting things.

14:24.502 --> 14:28.624
Because as you know, Ruffians, it's officially December 1st!

14:28.644 --> 14:29.584
It is.

14:29.864 --> 14:31.825
That means it's the last month of the year.

14:31.985 --> 14:32.365
Indeed.

14:33.927 --> 14:44.382
We hope it's been a great year for you, but Ruffians, if maybe you feel like you need a little bit more cheer, especially holiday cheer, we have just the thing!

14:50.143 --> 14:53.964
hololive English Abbey Calendar is back this year!

14:54.484 --> 14:55.104
It's back!

14:55.204 --> 14:56.365
FUWAMOCO Morning!

14:56.505 --> 15:00.126
And of course, the video has already been revealed!

15:00.266 --> 15:04.707
You know, we have Kiara-senpai there looking mighty.

15:05.507 --> 15:06.187
Santa.

15:06.567 --> 15:07.167
Ruffians.

15:13.289 --> 15:20.134
We also have some very, uh, we have very, very cute thumbnails by Pongsamori!

15:20.855 --> 15:27.700
But you know, there'll be something new and special every day for you unveiled at 4pm PT leading up to Christmas.

15:28.321 --> 15:35.827
And you know, as FUWAMOCO, we were actually a part of the first video in the advent calendar.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.228
Did you see it?

15:37.248 --> 15:41.331
We sung a silly song with Kiara-senpai and Calli-senpai and Nerissa!

15:41.471 --> 15:42.712
Yeah, Fuwawa.

15:43.568 --> 15:52.196
If you haven't checked it out yet, please do!

15:52.336 --> 15:52.876
You liked it!

15:52.996 --> 15:54.578
Thank you!

15:54.618 --> 15:55.378
It was very silly.

15:55.499 --> 15:57.640
It was.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.303
Please go check it out at holoen-abyss.com.

16:00.443 --> 16:01.984
That's holoen-abyss.com.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.249
Alvin.com.

16:07.729 --> 16:10.211
And that way you can view the Alvin calendar.

16:10.431 --> 16:14.115
Please don't forget to click through the days to look at the previous videos too.

16:14.155 --> 16:17.097
I think if you go now it'll be like day 2 and it won't have a video.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.639
But you just need to click.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.460
Go to day 1 and you can see the video.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.942
Otherwise you have to wait until 4pm.

16:23.363 --> 16:25.585
You don't want to wait all the time, huh?

16:25.845 --> 16:27.046
But it'll be a lot of fun!

16:27.146 --> 16:28.447
Okay, so don't miss them.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.148
Got it?

16:30.201 --> 16:33.483
Why don't you, maybe, I know maybe it's not good.

16:33.883 --> 16:38.446
Maybe you might get in trouble, but you could leave the tab open.

16:39.186 --> 16:44.049
And you know, refresh every day for a new video.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.570
That's a good idea, Mococo-chan.

16:46.030 --> 16:48.431
You don't have a lot of tabs open, right Ruffians?

16:48.451 --> 16:50.512
Right.

16:50.573 --> 16:55.315
Right, good idea.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.496
Smart thinking.

16:56.596 --> 16:58.357
I don't have a lot of tabs open either.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.115
Yeah!

17:02.175 --> 17:05.098
BAU BAU!

17:05.899 --> 17:18.313
And we also made our first appearance on the official hololive English YouTube channel the other day with Kiara-senpai, Calli-senpai, and IRyS-senpai.

17:18.733 --> 17:19.834
Because...

17:20.675 --> 17:27.437
Well, we wanted to talk about the hololive English Concert, Connect the World that happened in LA during the summer.

17:27.897 --> 17:30.218
And, uh, well, Ruffians, did you watch it?

17:31.758 --> 17:35.599
It was before, a little bit before Alvin debuted.

17:37.380 --> 17:42.221
You know, Alvin was actually even teased first at that concert.

17:42.781 --> 17:43.501
You did!

17:44.042 --> 17:44.922
You remember that?

17:49.966 --> 17:52.630
If you haven't watched the concert yet, it's good.

17:52.770 --> 17:56.795
It's good still because you still have that chance, that extra special chance.

17:56.875 --> 18:03.543
But, well, in fact for us it was a very very special concert so we are really happy to be able to

18:04.941 --> 18:09.766
Share our feelings and our thoughts on it, especially with all our other senpai you know.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.030
And you know we also made a very special announcement!

18:13.150 --> 18:13.711
Yeah!

18:14.131 --> 18:17.415
There will be a BLUE RAY RELEASE!

18:17.515 --> 18:19.077
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

18:19.137 --> 18:20.879
BAU RELEASE!

18:20.919 --> 18:21.479
BAU RELEASE!

18:24.022 --> 18:25.563
It's really, really amazing, right?

18:25.883 --> 18:27.904
We're so lucky, Ruffians!

18:28.064 --> 18:32.207
You know, a lot of hard work goes into making the physical releases like this.

18:32.547 --> 18:35.488
So we hope that you'll want to get your paws on it.

18:36.249 --> 18:42.312
And maybe, you know, one day, if Advent gets to perform at a hololive English Concert... Again?

18:42.773 --> 18:43.053
Again?

18:43.613 --> 18:44.033
Not again.

18:45.694 --> 18:46.455
Someday!

18:46.635 --> 18:47.375
Not again!

18:47.455 --> 18:48.015
Someday!

18:48.336 --> 18:48.576
You know.

18:49.216 --> 18:55.478
That there will be a physical release on it so that we can watch it over and over and over and treasure all the moments forever and ever.

18:55.738 --> 18:56.738
That would be nice.

18:57.018 --> 18:58.178
It's a lot of hoping.

18:59.159 --> 18:59.899
We'll be waiting too!

19:00.019 --> 19:00.499
Thank you!

19:00.519 --> 19:01.759
We'll be waiting too!

19:01.859 --> 19:02.780
But, guess what?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.960
You don't need to wait for the blu-ray to connect the world.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.641
Although maybe you do a little bit, but...

19:08.141 --> 19:11.523
It's coming so very soon!

19:11.563 --> 19:23.548
And if you happen to watch the stream of the concert live too, on the Blu-ray there are different camera angles and name changes made too, so I'm sure that you'll find new things that surprise you too!

19:24.048 --> 19:25.349
Lots of things to enjoy!

19:25.509 --> 19:28.551
BAU BAU!

19:28.891 --> 19:29.711
Very exciting.

19:31.892 --> 19:33.493
Who would think a Blu-ray release?

19:35.253 --> 19:39.476
Well, Ruffians, the next... Well, it's sort of exciting.

19:39.496 --> 19:40.677
This is crazy!

19:40.777 --> 19:41.718
Sort of crazy.

19:41.738 --> 19:43.039
Mind-blowing.

19:43.339 --> 19:44.020
Mind-blowing.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.321
Mind-boggling.

19:45.341 --> 19:46.622
Wow.

19:47.643 --> 19:47.883
Yeah.

19:48.503 --> 19:53.247
Well, Ruffians, you know how we played hololive Suica, right?

19:53.287 --> 19:54.968
Because there was a big update!

19:55.008 --> 20:01.113
Like the DM members, ID members, and FUWAMOCO too!

20:01.213 --> 20:03.295
But, Mumei-senpai!

20:04.745 --> 20:07.087
She was playing Holosuika before bed.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.509
You know, something that we often do too, but look.

20:12.650 --> 20:13.711
Look at this.

20:18.013 --> 20:21.835
Not only did she get over 10k, but she broke 15,000!

20:21.976 --> 20:26.398
That's absolutely bonkers.

20:26.418 --> 20:27.319
Bonkers.

20:28.379 --> 20:29.160
How did she do it?

20:31.045 --> 20:31.865
How did she do it?

20:32.385 --> 20:40.687
I mean, I think you... It's kind of that solid foundation that she has at the bottom, you know, with the Fuwawas and the Mococos near each other, right?

20:40.727 --> 20:43.187
Yeah, it's very definitely the key to that.

20:43.307 --> 20:49.349
Yeah, it's because of the beautiful harmony that only we can create as twin sisters.

20:49.389 --> 20:50.889
The harmony that we provide.

20:50.909 --> 20:52.949
She was able to create such an amazing score.

20:52.969 --> 20:53.970
Definitely, definitely.

20:54.030 --> 20:57.670
Yes, we built up the amazing score for her, that's for sure.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.031
It's a strong base, right?

21:02.588 --> 21:06.571
Well, I hope that Mumei-senpai had fun.

21:07.072 --> 21:09.794
That it was a good game.

21:10.935 --> 21:13.237
Maybe this is it.

21:14.218 --> 21:17.500
We're giving up on getting the highest score in hololive English.

21:18.621 --> 21:20.463
I don't think we can even get close to that.

21:24.588 --> 21:26.092
I guess Mumei-senpai, you can have it.

21:26.112 --> 21:26.513
She deserves it.

21:35.101 --> 21:36.002
BAU BAU!

21:36.062 --> 21:36.462
Ruffians!

21:36.703 --> 21:38.544
No, you guys don't do it!

21:38.624 --> 21:40.586
Thank you for believing in us!

21:40.626 --> 21:41.246
That's very nice.

21:41.286 --> 21:42.007
Thank you!

21:42.407 --> 21:43.588
BAU BAU!

21:43.648 --> 21:46.270
Congratulations, Ruby Senpai!

21:46.310 --> 21:47.611
BAU BAU!

21:47.791 --> 21:49.232
That's amazing.

21:49.753 --> 21:50.273
It's crazy.

21:51.154 --> 21:52.235
I don't know if I believe it.

21:52.715 --> 21:56.578
I know, I was kind of thinking, Ruby Senpai's pretty smart, maybe.

21:57.759 --> 21:58.680
But no.

21:59.940 --> 22:03.662
But no, she didn't do anything wrong.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.943
Naughty.

22:05.983 --> 22:07.544
She didn't do anything naughty, okay?

22:07.804 --> 22:08.204
No.

22:08.964 --> 22:10.285
Yeah.

22:11.165 --> 22:15.327
On this topic, nice to do FUWAMOCO!

22:15.787 --> 22:18.288
Because Ruffians, it's a new month.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.289
It's a new month.

22:19.369 --> 22:23.670
A new month and we're definitely starting it off on the right paw.

22:23.710 --> 22:23.911
Yeah.

22:24.211 --> 22:24.751
Cause you know,

22:25.851 --> 22:28.293
We're FUWAMOCO!

22:28.833 --> 22:40.802
So we're happy to announce that we'll be starting the summer off with... No Misunderstandings!

22:40.862 --> 22:45.025
This is very very accurate, as always.

22:45.325 --> 22:47.987
The majority of days have no misunderstandings.

22:48.047 --> 22:50.429
This is how it goes.

22:51.369 --> 22:51.810
Every day.

22:53.331 --> 23:03.699
Let's make sure that we do well, that we have no misunderstandings this month at all, and that way, Yagoo Santa-san will visit us this year, okay?

23:03.839 --> 23:05.120
Okay, Ruffians?

23:05.560 --> 23:07.001
You're part of this too, okay?

23:08.943 --> 23:11.745
We want Yagoo Santa-san to visit you, right?

23:12.065 --> 23:12.525
Right.

23:13.706 --> 23:14.046
Yes.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.047
I thought you would be excited!

23:34.011 --> 23:39.815
I guess Ruffians don't have that kind of aspirations, huh?

23:41.716 --> 23:45.158
What if we want Yagoo-san to visit us?

23:46.079 --> 23:46.799
Are you gonna help?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.741
Help us with no misunderstandings!

23:51.863 --> 23:54.784
Ho ho ho, sou desu ne.

23:55.865 --> 23:58.847
You're not helping the misunderstandings, Fuwawa!

23:58.927 --> 24:00.948
I didn't do anything wrong!

24:02.677 --> 24:02.817
Huh?

24:03.738 --> 24:05.198
We want to be on the good list.

24:05.858 --> 24:06.219
Yeah.

24:07.159 --> 24:08.540
Are we on the good list?

24:09.440 --> 24:10.881
Or are we naughty puppies?

24:11.961 --> 24:15.763
Which hololive members are on the back?

24:15.803 --> 24:16.463
Ruffians.

24:17.944 --> 24:18.264
Yes?

24:18.744 --> 24:19.725
What does that mean?

24:19.785 --> 24:20.025
Yes!

24:23.982 --> 24:27.445
I don't think there's a misunderstanding here because it says right there.

24:27.906 --> 24:30.268
Days without misunderstandings.

24:31.449 --> 24:31.609
One.

24:32.049 --> 24:32.189
One.

24:32.630 --> 24:32.970
Okay?

24:33.190 --> 24:34.511
Yeah.

24:34.792 --> 24:37.734
Yagoo-san desai is gonna be here, okay?

24:38.255 --> 24:38.415
Yeah.

24:40.885 --> 24:42.266
BAU BAU!

24:42.466 --> 24:44.547
BAU BAU, PREPARE!

24:44.607 --> 24:48.209
Well, Mococo-chan, let's go to our regular corner.

24:48.229 --> 24:51.170
Starting with our Doggie of the Day!

24:51.530 --> 24:53.031
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

24:53.071 --> 24:56.033
We have... De-den!

24:56.293 --> 24:58.874
WALL-E!

24:59.314 --> 25:00.975
WALL-E FOR SHORT!

25:01.015 --> 25:03.677
WALL-E!

25:03.717 --> 25:04.757
WALL-E!

25:04.877 --> 25:06.038
WALL-E!

25:06.138 --> 25:07.498
I want to hug his face.

25:08.079 --> 25:09.840
He's like, this is his expression.

25:12.909 --> 25:16.911
I just wanted to take his face and flop it all around, you know?

25:16.971 --> 25:20.153
He looks like he could fly.

25:23.354 --> 25:28.617
He's this Ruffian's cousin's dog, and apparently he's very friendly and naughty.

25:28.937 --> 25:30.318
That's a good combination.

25:30.998 --> 25:32.639
But which list is he going to be on?

25:33.799 --> 25:34.560
The best one.

25:36.161 --> 25:39.962
He loves playing with people and running around too.

25:41.681 --> 25:44.022
I kind of want to ruff house with him.

25:44.122 --> 25:46.344
I want to hear him go BAU BAU BAU!

25:46.844 --> 25:49.566
I want to play growl with him.

25:49.726 --> 25:50.466
It would be good.

25:51.026 --> 25:52.187
I think it would be fun!

25:52.767 --> 25:55.209
Very cute.

25:56.590 --> 26:00.412
How does Wally bow bow?

26:00.672 --> 26:03.113
I think it's sort of a deep bow.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.535
BAU.

26:05.715 --> 26:05.975
BAU.

26:07.076 --> 26:08.316
I think it's like a BAU.

26:08.717 --> 26:09.517
BAU.

26:10.097 --> 26:10.278
What?

26:13.098 --> 26:20.902
It sounds like a frog.

26:20.922 --> 26:23.483
Don't make fun of Wally!

26:23.503 --> 26:25.604
That's not how he sounds!

26:25.644 --> 26:26.925
Don't make fun of Wally!

26:26.965 --> 26:27.946
That's rude, Moco-chan!

26:30.177 --> 26:36.701
Well, I think Wally looks like the kind of friend that you really want to go on adventures with.

26:36.841 --> 26:43.385
A doggie that will definitely make you laugh and paint lots of memorable moments together with.

26:43.646 --> 26:46.808
Especially since he likes to be naughty sometimes too.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.370
Memorable in a good way.

26:52.670 --> 26:57.652
Being naughty is okay because I think sometimes we all like to be a bit naughty too.

26:57.752 --> 27:00.813
It makes for a silly and fun life, right?

27:03.054 --> 27:03.534
Hi.

27:05.095 --> 27:09.396
Even though you know Yago Santa-san needs to visit us too, so we gotta make sure that we're okay.

27:09.436 --> 27:11.157
Well, we better prepare too, okay?

27:11.893 --> 27:14.294
BAU BAU!

27:16.314 --> 27:20.915
Well, I'm feeling pretty chilly right now, but how are the ruffians doing?

27:20.935 --> 27:22.315
You're not feeling too chilly?

27:22.335 --> 27:23.535
How are your walks?

27:23.675 --> 27:25.376
How are the walks going?

27:25.796 --> 27:26.436
Let's see!

27:26.516 --> 27:28.896
Today I went on a walk.

27:28.976 --> 27:30.497
Where did this ruffian go for a walk?

27:30.817 --> 27:31.097
De-den!

27:31.197 --> 27:31.977
That's winking.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.748
It looks so real!

27:39.228 --> 27:40.849
It's so beautiful!

27:41.209 --> 27:46.770
I don't know, somehow this photo looks both very cold and extremely warm at the same time.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.830
Don't you think, Moco-chan?

27:47.870 --> 27:50.091
No, I think it just looks very, very cold.

27:50.431 --> 27:51.091
Not warm.

27:51.191 --> 27:54.312
I hope that you're very, very well bundled up though.

27:54.352 --> 27:57.392
I can imagine how my toes would feel if they feel like they are right now.

28:00.319 --> 28:06.802
Well, hopefully you had some good snow boots and some mittens and everything on, some big fluffy socks.

28:07.223 --> 28:08.163
FUWAMOCO!

28:08.243 --> 28:08.963
FUWAMOCO socks!

28:09.184 --> 28:11.205
And maybe some goggles too!

28:12.305 --> 28:14.206
Please make sure to stay warm, okay?

28:14.286 --> 28:16.307
And be safe as well.

28:17.048 --> 28:17.488
Thank you.

28:17.788 --> 28:20.970
Thank you for sending us a little look into your world!

28:21.030 --> 28:21.450
BAU BAU!

28:25.367 --> 28:27.248
I think we got another question today.

28:27.628 --> 28:30.110
Let's check out our Question of the Day!

28:30.410 --> 28:33.052
We have... De-den!

28:33.532 --> 28:34.493
Good morning, FUWAMOCO!

28:34.553 --> 28:35.413
Good morning!

28:35.713 --> 28:43.758
I was checking some old, old, old anime songs on YouTube and saw a video with romaji lyrics in it, very nostalgic.

28:44.119 --> 28:46.740
Out of curiosity, here's my question.

28:47.361 --> 28:53.564
When you perform slash sing JP songs during karaoke, do you use lyrics in romaji format?

28:54.545 --> 28:56.006
This is actually a very good question.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.046
A very good question.

28:57.146 --> 29:00.607
Especially since our Rock n' Rawr party is tomorrow!

29:00.687 --> 29:02.428
Yeah!

29:02.508 --> 29:04.569
Well, the answer is it really depends.

29:04.629 --> 29:15.073
Yeah, I guess the most preferred format for us is a video with timed lyrics in Japanese and furigana, which is like little hiragana on top of the complicated kanji.

29:15.493 --> 29:17.814
Because, you know, it's helpful.

29:18.314 --> 29:21.555
But a lot of times, we don't get that.

29:22.267 --> 29:27.969
So we have to go source our own lyrics, and that's where sometimes it gets a bit rough.

29:28.209 --> 29:29.709
I know.

29:30.930 --> 29:41.353
Again, it's most preferred if it's in Japanese, but sometimes you need furigana because for us, we need to be able to know how it's right at a glance, you know, because we're gonna sing it any second, you know?

29:41.653 --> 29:45.735
But for example, it can get tricky because there's like, ashita, tomorrow, right?

29:45.755 --> 29:46.615
The kanji for tomorrow.

29:47.435 --> 29:49.216
It could be ashita or asu.

29:49.236 --> 29:51.318
Same as like iku and yuku.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.620
It's small things but it's important.

30:10.292 --> 30:17.354
I know it's happened before, but sometimes when we source our lyrics, there are mistakes in them.

30:19.055 --> 30:23.576
And somebody read the lyrics wrong, or maybe a whole section is gone.

30:25.057 --> 30:29.158
We try to check them over beforehand, but sometimes we run out of time.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.334
It's tricky, I know it.

30:33.536 --> 30:39.362
We do our best though, but sometimes we have to get a bit resourceful too.

30:39.842 --> 30:42.005
A lot of preparation.

30:42.065 --> 30:42.625
That's right.

30:43.907 --> 30:47.410
It's a lot of preparation that's not actually practicing.

30:47.911 --> 30:50.654
We know that.

30:55.104 --> 31:03.393
It can be tricky, but it's fun.

31:04.273 --> 31:05.975
The brain has to go pretty fast.

31:06.015 --> 31:06.756
BAU BAU!

31:06.976 --> 31:11.741
Thank you for the question.

31:11.821 --> 31:14.584
Thank you Ruffians for your submissions today too.

31:19.654 --> 31:27.617
Ruffians, we're always looking for more Doggy of the Days for your Pero Sighting, for your walks even though it's cold out, for your questions too!

31:27.738 --> 31:28.498
Do your best!

31:28.518 --> 31:34.640
So if anything comes to mind, please use the hashtag, hashtag FWMCMORNING and let us know, okay?

31:34.660 --> 31:35.961
Yeah, don't hesitate!

31:37.081 --> 31:38.622
BAU BAU!

31:39.222 --> 31:41.103
Now for our next stream!

31:41.163 --> 31:42.544
We have...

31:43.064 --> 31:44.445
De-den!

31:44.845 --> 31:45.766
Tonight!

31:45.946 --> 31:51.290
We're having a comfy movie night together with all of Abbot over on Shiori's channel.

31:51.330 --> 31:51.891
Comfy.

31:52.111 --> 31:52.491
Comfy.

31:52.571 --> 31:54.453
Yeah, look at us on the sofa, there's comfy.

31:54.593 --> 31:55.333
Comfy.

31:55.714 --> 32:01.938
But this time we're watching her movie pick, which is a movie called The Silence of the Lambs.

32:04.180 --> 32:07.502
I think that it's probably best not to bring snacks.

32:09.064 --> 32:10.405
Save those for later, okay?

32:11.630 --> 32:14.332
Yeah, concern for the doggos, thank you!

32:15.113 --> 32:18.536
I'm not too sure what to expect, but I'm kinda concerned too.

32:19.076 --> 32:20.998
Every movie is a bit concerned, right?

32:21.018 --> 32:22.739
A bit concerning.

32:23.520 --> 32:28.644
Yeah, but I'm sure it'll be eventful just like every movie night has been, right?

32:29.065 --> 32:29.825
Yeah, it's been fun.

32:31.386 --> 32:33.408
If it's with Abyss, it's definitely fine.

32:33.568 --> 32:36.129
BAU BAU!

32:36.649 --> 32:41.412
And if we take a peek at our schedule, we have De-den!

32:42.272 --> 32:46.235
Well, tomorrow we're having another Rock n' Rawr Party!

32:46.295 --> 32:47.375
This time,

32:49.520 --> 32:50.641
Extra Special!

32:50.701 --> 32:52.163
Extra Special!

32:52.183 --> 32:55.627
Ruffians, we haven't announced the theme yet, right?

32:55.647 --> 32:56.307
We haven't, no.

32:56.367 --> 32:58.289
So maybe we should?

32:58.690 --> 32:59.270
Oh, yeah.

32:59.511 --> 33:03.315
Well, Ruffians, you've heard of 2.5D idols, right?

33:03.775 --> 33:04.276
Have you?

33:04.656 --> 33:04.997
Why?

33:05.057 --> 33:05.097
2.5D.

33:06.378 --> 33:06.578
Wow!

33:11.098 --> 33:18.983
Actually, this time we're going to be singing Only Love Live at Idolmas!

33:19.063 --> 33:20.664
BAU BAU!

33:20.924 --> 33:25.666
The two worlds come together in a perfect idol harmony this time!

33:25.847 --> 33:27.548
Let's have lots of fun.

33:27.628 --> 33:29.529
Excited!

33:29.849 --> 33:37.914
Let's have lots of fun singing all the classics and the hit songs too.

33:38.034 --> 33:39.554
Make sure you do, okay?

33:39.775 --> 33:40.175
We're gonna

33:40.575 --> 33:45.240
Start a happy party train and go my FUWAMOCO!

33:45.300 --> 33:46.481
Go my way!

33:46.822 --> 33:50.866

33:51.647 --> 33:57.793

34:06.719 --> 34:17.205
