00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.994
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:17.179
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.742
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:21.084
BAU BAU!

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:24.247
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.534
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:38.637
Together we are... Moco-chan, why are you laughing?

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:42.060
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.382
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:49.686
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:52.848
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:59.491
Thank you for joining us for today, the 85th episode of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:00.931
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:09.455
And it's officially the first episode of FUWAMOCO Morning with FUWAMOCO and our new dog!

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:11.416
It's been a while!

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:13.257
It's been a while.

00:06:13.277 --> 00:06:16.839
Ruffians, were you able to wake up okay?

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.480
You know, it's the first FUWAMOCO Morning since

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.022
The end of February?

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:24.505
It's nice this year again!

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:25.947
Bright and early!

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.749
You sleeping?

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:30.532
You're awake!

00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:33.313
You're awake now!

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.414
FUWAMOCO Morning is back!

00:06:36.654 --> 00:06:38.255
BAU BAU!

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:40.155
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.096
Ah, I see some Ruffians!

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:44.037
I see some new Ruffians?

00:06:44.477 --> 00:06:45.097
I don't know.

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:49.478
I think some Ruffians are still feeling a bit sleepy.

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.299
But I think...

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.956
I'm feeling sleepy too.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.757
Hi, I'm Moco-chan!

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:01.380
My eyes get very open!

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:11.548
Well, for Ruffians that are maybe this is your first FUWAMOCO Morning, and for maybe Ruffians who are half asleep and kind of forgot... Like me!

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:21.053
To explain, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short, full-out morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:07:21.293 --> 00:07:22.614
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:07:22.634 --> 00:07:26.135
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:32.218
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:35.580
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.881
Moco-chan, you can say that right now.

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:47.650
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.053
BAU BAU!

00:07:59.252 --> 00:08:00.073
Big Ruffians!

00:08:00.573 --> 00:08:05.777
You know, you know that there's been a lot going on in FUWAMOCO's world recently.

00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:08.279
And I'm sure yours too, right?

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:09.000
Right!

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.543
A lot of things, you know, busy busy.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:20.329
But with FUWAMOCO, we haven't really had too much time to think about things that, like, immediately going on!

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:20.589
Right!

00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:21.870
That's right in our face!

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.991
Yeah, but...

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:27.316
You know, I think maybe you've been wondering.

00:08:28.437 --> 00:08:30.937
I've seen a couple comments here and there.

00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:31.037
Yeah.

00:08:31.338 --> 00:08:32.578
You know.

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:35.459
Where is Pero?

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:39.120
Where is Pero?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.522
You know, I've got some questions from you.

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:44.222
Yeah.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.125
Well, Ruffians!

00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:51.008
It looks like you can breathe a sigh of relief!

00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:51.948
That's good!

00:08:51.988 --> 00:08:54.230
Yeah, because I'm Ruffian this year!

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.751
Oh my god!

00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:55.491
Recently!

00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:56.492
Okay.

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:58.553
Let's see where we spotted.

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:01.976
Usually we're not that excited, but... Let's see!

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:02.756
It's rare!

00:09:02.796 --> 00:09:04.518
Has Pero been on vacation?

00:09:05.118 --> 00:09:05.679
Wow!

00:09:11.063 --> 00:09:11.123
Oh...

00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:18.887
Did you get a virus on your phone?

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.889
That's pretty impressive.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.191
I guess Pero's taking over.

00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:26.134
I wonder what he's planning.

00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:30.598
Why would Pero want to control your smartphone?

00:09:30.618 --> 00:09:33.721
I don't know if you think about it.

00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:38.186
You know, our smartphones are a key part of our daily life, right?

00:09:40.087 --> 00:09:40.388
Yeah.

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:48.474
Yeah, it's hard to do some things without it, so... You know, if Heretics control the phone... Controls the person.

00:09:48.494 --> 00:09:53.075
Wait, huh?

00:09:54.276 --> 00:09:55.096
What's he planning?

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:58.277
Is he planning to take control of every Ruffian?

00:09:58.677 --> 00:09:59.097
Huh?

00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:00.398
Huh?

00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:05.359
Is he planning... World domination?

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:08.480
I thought that was our plan.

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:15.716
Well, I'm sure he's not planning to do something as sinister as that.

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:18.618
But he is Pero after all.

00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:20.379
Yeah.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:23.761
Well, I guess you never know, huh?

00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:24.622
Yeah, maybe.

00:10:25.242 --> 00:10:29.665
Do you think he'll at least order us some Ponder Wings as a housewarming gift?

00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.054
That would be nice!

00:10:32.775 --> 00:10:38.202
Not that we haven't had a bunch of pon-de-rings already, but... BAU BAU!

00:10:38.843 --> 00:10:40.204
More pon-de-rings is always good.

00:10:40.304 --> 00:10:41.866
Oh, thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:45.651
Thank you!

00:10:46.672 --> 00:10:47.814
BAU BAU!

00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:50.377
I think there might be some Ruffians!

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:56.240
You know, but, well, you know, your life is busy.

00:10:56.561 --> 00:11:01.023
That's why we're so happy to be a part of your morning like this with FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:09.709
But just in case you know you've been extra extra extra busy and kind of wondering where is FUWAMOCO, you know?

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.651
We know there's lots of you, so don't feel silly, okay?

00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:21.456
Well, for the past month or so, we've actually been in Japan moving into our new doghouse!

00:11:21.737 --> 00:11:23.257
We did it, Ruffians!

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:25.399
Doghouse!

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.163
A new chapter to FUWAMOCO's journey has officially begun!

00:11:33.507 --> 00:11:37.608
It was a little bit of a ruff move, a really ruff move.

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:38.249
Just a bit.

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:41.330
Kaori-senpai!

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.670
Good piece!

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.211
BAU BAU!

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:50.513
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:51.453
BAU BAU!

00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:56.975
Well, you know, now in our new throne house, we're in Japan.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:01.397
I was just so incredibly happy to be back here with you.

00:12:01.517 --> 00:12:05.458
We're really looking forward to, you know, sharing a lot of silly moments together.

00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:07.759
Ah, thank you Gally-senpai!

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:09.600
BAU BAU!

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:18.623
And you know, not just silly moments, but you know, hopefully we can share a lot more about what it's like living in Japan as Demon Guide Dogs.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:29.102
Of course, we're still kind of getting used to a lot of things, but we sure will have lots of interesting stories to share.

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:32.343
Some that only FUWAMOCO could have!

00:12:32.363 --> 00:12:33.344
Right?

00:12:33.364 --> 00:12:40.846
Yeah, there's already been lots of silly mishaps, but please look forward to our new adventures!

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:46.147
And you know, not just new adventures, but we know a lot of Ruffians are wondering, why?

00:12:46.887 --> 00:12:48.448
That means FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:50.770
It's midnight, FUWAMOCO.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.431
That's gonna be hard on them.

00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:55.033
What about their other stream time?

00:12:55.974 --> 00:13:01.458
But actually, this schedule is way better for us!

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:02.079
It is.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:05.482
We can actually get a proper sleep, you know?

00:13:05.502 --> 00:13:05.902
Sleep?

00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:07.704
Not such a day, guys!

00:13:07.804 --> 00:13:10.886
Not 3 to 4 hours, but a full sleep.

00:13:10.906 --> 00:13:14.269
You know, FUWAMOCO, we're long sleepers!

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.931
We're not good with naps.

00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:17.832
We need a full rest.

00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:19.333
Yeah, I know.

00:13:19.353 --> 00:13:21.373
And now we can do that!

00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:24.934
And still have just as much fun if not more.

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:28.795
Yeah, but like we said before, you know, we're the same dogs.

00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:31.716
But, you know, now we just have new digs.

00:13:32.216 --> 00:13:35.316
And we're not in the Northwest Passage anymore, we're in Japan!

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:37.257
But other than that...

00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:39.325
Same, FUWAMOCO.

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:39.525
Same.

00:13:39.926 --> 00:13:49.793
And you know we hope that this move will help us be able to grow ourselves as demon guard dogs and allow us to try out a bunch of new exciting things to help protect your smile.

00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:53.636
We'll continue to do our best!

00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:54.297
Yeah!

00:13:54.317 --> 00:13:55.498
Okay, more fans!

00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:58.580
Thank you!

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.581
I can still wink.

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:04.548
BAU BAU!

00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:07.510
BAU BAU!

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:30.974
Lots of exciting things going on, but yesterday was also very exciting because it was the birthday of Advent Shining Gem Koseki Bijou!

00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:33.095
Biboo's birthday!

00:14:35.357 --> 00:14:41.580
She had a slumber party together with all the pebbles and all of us too!

00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:44.262
It was a bunch of fun, right, Ruffians?

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:44.982
Yeah!

00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:46.183
Right.

00:14:46.683 --> 00:14:51.186
Yeah, you know, we watched a movie that she went to watch called Space Jam.

00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:52.566
Space Jam.

00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:55.088
And it was about basketball!

00:14:55.288 --> 00:14:56.148
Which was fun.

00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:56.669
Fun.

00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:57.749
Basketball.

00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:58.269
Right.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.672
And Nerissa, she said that there was a cute girl, but

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:04.851
I don't know.

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:05.331
I only saw one.

00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:06.252
I saw a bunny.

00:15:06.292 --> 00:15:07.352
There was a bunny lady.

00:15:07.693 --> 00:15:09.954
Maybe she was there for 30 seconds.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:10.295
Yeah.

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:11.495
A minute, maybe.

00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:12.596
I don't know.

00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:14.337
Bunny lady.

00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:17.560
I feel like Pekora-senpai is much cuter.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.522
I didn't really feel much, honestly.

00:15:20.982 --> 00:15:21.323
BAU.

00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:23.084
Love you.

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:28.108
Moco-chan.

00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:29.649
Who's cuter, Kai?

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.814
Oh, it's this time of day!

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:40.618
Pekora-senpai.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.522
Pekora-senpai's the cutest!

00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:46.944
How ruff he is?

00:15:48.085 --> 00:15:52.228
But Pekora-senpai's our sister, right?

00:15:53.029 --> 00:15:54.150
She's our sister then.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.712
She's cute.

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:00.976
Fuwawa's the cutest!

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:02.967
BAU BAU!

00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:04.128
Hi!

00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:06.070
It's me, Moco!

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.030
Who is it?

00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.251
You're the cutest!

00:16:08.972 --> 00:16:09.292
Hi!

00:16:09.372 --> 00:16:10.894
It's you who's the cutest!

00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:11.995
Oh.

00:16:13.876 --> 00:16:14.016
Oh.

00:16:15.137 --> 00:16:16.218
Fuwawocutest.

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:18.020
BAU BAU!

00:16:20.482 --> 00:16:20.602
Hi.

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:22.343
Mococute!

00:16:22.764 --> 00:16:23.684
I saw Mococute!

00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:26.267
I searched for a while but I didn't see a Mococute!

00:16:26.507 --> 00:16:27.167
Moco-chan!

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:27.908
Why?

00:16:28.128 --> 00:16:30.050
I think that means you're cute.

00:16:34.572 --> 00:16:40.354
But, after that, we played jackpot games together, which was really fun.

00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:41.715
We designed t-shirts.

00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:43.596
T-shirts, yeah.

00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:45.316
They're kind of really silly.

00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:51.739
But, you can even order your own shirt if you want something sort of scribble-like.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:52.339
Like that.

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:53.660
Yeah, I made a...

00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:57.082
Fuwawa shirt.

00:16:57.222 --> 00:16:58.303
I'm sorry, Moco-chan.

00:16:58.403 --> 00:16:59.964
I didn't have time to draw you.

00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:04.508
It says BAU BAU and I look very, uh... I was the designer.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.370
Oh, you designed it?

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:06.690
Yes.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:07.471
Oh!

00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:08.672
Team effort!

00:17:08.932 --> 00:17:10.593
Also, it is a FUWAMOCO shirt.

00:17:11.074 --> 00:17:16.418
But more importantly!

00:17:16.718 --> 00:17:18.900
Biboo's birthday merch!

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.542
It's super cute, just like Biboo.

00:17:22.123 --> 00:17:23.244
Maybe not as cute as...

00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:27.044
No, it's pretty cute.

00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:29.407
You know, Biboo in her pajamas.

00:17:29.427 --> 00:17:29.547
Yeah!

00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:31.309
A bunch of plushies.

00:17:31.489 --> 00:17:31.990
Very cute.

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.373
And she has a tapestry.

00:17:34.433 --> 00:17:35.595
Who wouldn't want a tapestry?

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:35.975
Right.

00:17:37.233 --> 00:17:40.395
You know, proudly display, you know, on the walls.

00:17:40.975 --> 00:17:42.315
Maybe right above your bed.

00:17:42.476 --> 00:17:43.016
It's cute.

00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:43.436
Right?

00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:44.897
You can say goodnight, Biboo.

00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:45.457
But!

00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:46.477
Sleepy.

00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:53.041
Say sweet dreams to FUWAMOCO!

00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.002
Biboo also has a squishy Pebble Pushy.

00:17:56.062 --> 00:17:56.702
Pebble Pushy!

00:17:56.762 --> 00:17:58.123
It's just fun.

00:17:58.563 --> 00:18:03.666
Yeah, but I was a bit surprised though, because you know, Biboo's always saying she's rock hard, right?

00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:05.167
Right!

00:18:05.527 --> 00:18:09.609
But apparently pebbles, pebbles are squishy.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.970
You learn new stuff, huh?

00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:16.993
Well, I guess you can find out just how squishy they are if you get your own!

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:17.974
Yeah!

00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:22.776
But Biboo also has a super cute mug bag!

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:26.578
I'm pretty sure she designed herself too, she drew it!

00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:30.939
Ruffians, you know I love mugs!

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:33.460
And of course I won't watch you!

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.262
Yeah, but you know we don't have really mugs.

00:18:36.562 --> 00:18:37.282
We don't!

00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.543
It's the perfect time!

00:18:40.684 --> 00:18:44.366
But what will the mug situation be once it gets into our paws?

00:18:44.386 --> 00:18:44.966
Why did I say that?

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:48.188
I should have been quiet.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.649
Yeah, hopefully the mug is hard.

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:53.010
That would be hard to drink out of a soft mug.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.671
The squishy mug.

00:18:54.771 --> 00:18:55.631
Although that could be fun.

00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:56.652
It could be fun.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:57.963
Fluffy mug.

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.204
Fuzzy mug.

00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:01.345
Maybe hide the wash.

00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:04.647
Maybe waterproof fluff and fuzz.

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:05.167
Single use.

00:19:05.868 --> 00:19:09.310
Single use!

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.531
BAU BAU!

00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:17.095
You can place a pre-order for her birthday merch now on the official hololive shop, so please go check it out!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:21.576
And get your paws on Biboo's first birthday merch ever!

00:19:21.756 --> 00:19:24.016
BAU BAU!

00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:26.717
Fluffy fuzz in your mouth!

00:19:26.737 --> 00:19:30.277
I guess that's the downside of a fluffy and fuzzy mug, huh?

00:19:30.297 --> 00:19:31.318
Not moldy.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:34.298
Fluffy and fuzzy.

00:19:34.338 --> 00:19:35.898
You could put it on the handle.

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:37.639
The handle.

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:38.939
Right.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:39.579
Handle?

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:44.060
You shouldn't be touching the handle to your mouth when you're drinking out of a mug, right?

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:46.437
I'm confused.

00:19:46.577 --> 00:19:48.558
Mugs have handles, Moco-chan!

00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:51.660
Yeah, that's technically a handle.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.782
Why do I want to confuse Ruffians?

00:19:57.603 --> 00:19:58.483
BAU BAU!

00:19:58.543 --> 00:20:00.764
BAU BAU!

00:20:01.384 --> 00:20:03.685
Yeah, Moco-chan gets confused a lot.

00:20:04.626 --> 00:20:06.887
Which makes us susceptible.

00:20:11.485 --> 00:20:18.152
You know, when you just moved to a new country, it's kind of hard to get adjusted, right?

00:20:18.352 --> 00:20:19.954
It takes a little bit of time.

00:20:20.374 --> 00:20:23.597
You know, because there's still a lot of things you don't know about.

00:20:23.617 --> 00:20:23.757
Uh, yeah.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.521
Yeah.

00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:30.764
Well, we already got scammed.

00:20:38.274 --> 00:20:41.478
And yep, it was Moco-chan.

00:20:41.778 --> 00:20:43.080
It's all your fault, Moco-chan.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.901
It's not!

00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:50.268
Yeah, before it could stop things from happening, she had already swept her carton.

00:20:51.349 --> 00:20:55.434
And yeah, Moco-chan was coerced into buying some cheesecake.

00:20:57.811 --> 00:21:00.372
I have my reasons, okay?

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:03.712
It was because it was raining really hard all of a sudden.

00:21:03.732 --> 00:21:05.773
We had time, we needed to wait somewhere.

00:21:05.793 --> 00:21:07.033
I didn't want to wait in the rain.

00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:12.195
And then this nice lady calls out and goes, Oh, would you like to stay out of the rain and have some cheesecake?

00:21:12.235 --> 00:21:13.535
And I go, Oh, that sounds good.

00:21:13.575 --> 00:21:14.815
I have time for cheesecake.

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:16.036
I have time out of the rain.

00:21:16.436 --> 00:21:18.576
And so she said, Oh, well, here's some cheesecake.

00:21:18.636 --> 00:21:19.516
It's very fancy.

00:21:19.576 --> 00:21:21.937
And usually it's 2,000 yen, but for today only.

00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:22.457
2,000 yen per slice?

00:21:22.477 --> 00:21:23.097
That's like $20.

00:21:23.137 --> 00:21:23.517
Today it's like...

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:30.439
$1500 yen, so that's like $15 each per slice.

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:32.240
And I thought, wow, that's an expensive cheesecake.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.500
But I mean, we get to stay out of the rain, so it's okay.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.400
I guess we'll get one.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.481
She was like, do you want two?

00:21:36.501 --> 00:21:37.861
There's two of you.

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.281
And I said, no, we can share.

00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:39.942
It's okay.

00:21:40.002 --> 00:21:41.962
At first Moco-chan was like, oh, money-chan!

00:21:41.982 --> 00:21:43.423
We can get money-chan a piece.

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:44.963
I have to think about money-chan.

00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:47.044
So I was thinking about if we should get money-chan a piece.

00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:50.244
And then I was trying to phone money-chan because that's what Moco-chan said I should do.

00:21:50.264 --> 00:21:50.965
I said to phone.

00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:52.205
I needed to make decisions.

00:21:52.825 --> 00:22:01.794
And I decided to just get one piece, and then, and then, well, then I tried to... Can we go in the cafe this way?

00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:03.335
She goes, oh no, it's closed.

00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:06.238
Yeah, everything was drenched.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:14.045
Yeah, so that's why I ended up carrying a piece of cheesecake around with me all day long.

00:22:14.065 --> 00:22:16.147
Moco-chan wouldn't carry it.

00:22:16.988 --> 00:22:17.889
Yeah, but...

00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:25.059
You might know because we kind of talked about it already, but we hadn't eaten it yet.

00:22:25.419 --> 00:22:26.420
Well, we told you.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.081
Eatin' it?

00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:27.661
Eatin' it.

00:22:27.781 --> 00:22:28.522
Eatin' it yet.

00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:29.663
Which one is it?

00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:30.945
Eatin' it or eatin' it?

00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:31.545
Cheesecake.

00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:33.067
That's what it is.

00:22:33.587 --> 00:22:38.773
But actually, unfortunately, story continues, Ruffians!

00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:41.015
Yeah.

00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:53.935
Well, when we finally decided to eat it, we opened the box up, and there were two pieces of Ruffians!

00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:56.315
Two.

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.395
Two pieces.

00:22:58.016 --> 00:22:59.936
Even though we told her only one.

00:23:00.736 --> 00:23:01.056
Yeah.

00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:03.797
We made it very clear that we were gonna share.

00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:03.897
Yeah.

00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:05.958
Even though she suggested two.

00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:06.158
Yeah.

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:06.738
Yeah.

00:23:09.558 --> 00:23:11.599
And, it got worse.

00:23:12.762 --> 00:23:14.284
I went to check the receipt.

00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:18.850
Yeah, she charged us for two pieces.

00:23:19.852 --> 00:23:20.573
Why?

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:22.355
What the heck?

00:23:22.876 --> 00:23:23.296
Yeah.

00:23:24.598 --> 00:23:24.979
Yeah.

00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:29.399
Clearly, it's a very aggressive scam.

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:30.999
Cheesecake scam!

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:31.420
Yeah.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.861
It was over 3,000 yen.

00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:36.122
You know, which was already discounted.

00:23:36.142 --> 00:23:37.203
Already discounted.

00:23:37.223 --> 00:23:37.303
Yeah.

00:23:38.384 --> 00:23:42.786
For two small pieces of rather normal tasting cheesecake.

00:23:44.107 --> 00:23:44.547
Yeah.

00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:51.952
It was yummy, but rather than cake, it tasted like fancy cheese.

00:23:52.052 --> 00:23:52.952
Fancy cheese.

00:23:53.653 --> 00:23:55.494
And I don't like cheese.

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:07.619
The bright side is that this is the first scam.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.141
The first scam?

00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:10.981
Oh, right!

00:24:11.402 --> 00:24:14.343
It's the only scam that we get ourselves caught up in.

00:24:14.824 --> 00:24:15.524
Only scam?

00:24:15.644 --> 00:24:16.925
Only scam.

00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:20.687
This was a scam with a rather delicious ending, too!

00:24:21.107 --> 00:24:21.467
Right!

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:22.788
Only scam!

00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:24.429
Yeah, only one, right?

00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:24.869
Yeah.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.750
Only cheesecake scam.

00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:27.151
Yeah.

00:24:29.003 --> 00:24:29.983
BAU BAU!

00:24:30.003 --> 00:24:31.064
It has a happy end.

00:24:31.544 --> 00:24:32.884
BAU BAU!

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:36.046
Please don't get scammed anymore!

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:38.827
We'll do our best!

00:24:39.407 --> 00:24:42.048
I thought they were making scam Moco-chan though!

00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:42.788
No promises.

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:43.588
I don't know.

00:24:43.608 --> 00:24:46.549
Scam or... No... No...

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.772
We're not gonna make it a corner, Ruffians!

00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:53.594
We won't talk to strangers, okay?

00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:54.214
Yeah.

00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:56.156
That was my mistake, hi.

00:24:56.176 --> 00:24:58.718
She said she had cheesecake!

00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:01.960
She was cute, she had a nice voice too.

00:25:06.804 --> 00:25:07.664
BAU BAU.

00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:10.306
Well, Ruffians.

00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:15.090
On top of being a scoundrel.

00:25:16.323 --> 00:25:18.304
We have something else we need to tell you.

00:25:18.324 --> 00:25:24.346
And I know you hate to hear this, Ruffians, but it happened again.

00:25:24.366 --> 00:25:25.206
Not a scam.

00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:27.947
A different again.

00:25:28.547 --> 00:25:34.450
Yeah, you know, we thought, you know, that we have experience now, that we should be good, but nope.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.532
We had another misunderstanding.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.301
You know, it's been a while.

00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:46.861
A while for us.

00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:47.441
A bit.

00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:49.962
Right, and well.

00:25:53.923 --> 00:25:57.404
You know, despite sharing this with you every episode.

00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:02.065
Despite it being written at the top right of our screen.

00:26:02.345 --> 00:26:02.785
Yeah.

00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:04.726
Moco-chan.

00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:10.207
Moco-chan messed up the hashtag in our tweet.

00:26:14.748 --> 00:26:16.531
Tell the Ruffians what did you write!

00:26:19.214 --> 00:26:25.603
I wrote hashtag...hashtag... FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:26:28.348 --> 00:26:31.051
It should be FWMCMORNING.

00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:32.653
Sorry Moco-chan, I'm confused.

00:26:32.753 --> 00:26:34.335
I think there might be a misunderstanding.

00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:35.436
What was that?

00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:36.517
Hashtag!

00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:39.660
Hashtag FWMCMORNING.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.261
Moco-chan!

00:26:40.301 --> 00:26:42.223
You're making more misunderstandings!

00:26:42.563 --> 00:26:45.086
Hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:26:47.912 --> 00:26:49.913
Yes, you can tell it's very different.

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:51.433
One is correct!

00:26:52.154 --> 00:26:52.934
One isn't!

00:26:53.754 --> 00:26:55.275
Yeah, so Ruffians!

00:26:55.475 --> 00:26:59.577
When using the hashtag, make sure you don't have a fuzzy brain like Moco-chan.

00:27:00.117 --> 00:27:03.198
And get all confused and use the wrong one, okay?

00:27:03.218 --> 00:27:05.859
No misunderstanding, okay?

00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:07.060
Okay.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.400
Okay!

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.621
Ruffians, what is the right hashtag?

00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:13.883
This is the way you type, Moco-chan, right?

00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:15.183
We have to confirm.

00:27:15.263 --> 00:27:15.623
Yeah.

00:27:16.424 --> 00:27:17.184
Uh-huh.

00:27:19.091 --> 00:27:22.775
That's right, FWMCMORNING, but you've got the hashtag.

00:27:24.117 --> 00:27:25.458
Yeah!

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.064
See, Moco-chan, you just have to dress like the Ruffians, right?

00:27:31.812 --> 00:27:34.734
Well, we're always waiting for your thoughts and new submissions.

00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:39.958
Especially, you know, it's the first FUWAMOCO Morning in a long time.

00:27:40.938 --> 00:27:46.562
We'd especially love to hear about how FUWAMOCO Morning helps to start your day too.

00:27:47.283 --> 00:27:48.263
BAU BAU!

00:27:48.423 --> 00:27:50.545
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:56.649
It's the first FUWAMOCO Morning in a little while.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.090
But...

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:01.408
It's that time of the week, Ruffians!

00:28:01.769 --> 00:28:07.454
A new FUWAMOCO Morning, a new week, and a new challenge!

00:28:08.194 --> 00:28:12.638
It's time for Moco-chan's natto challenge!

00:28:16.187 --> 00:28:17.588
Moco-chan.

00:28:17.668 --> 00:28:19.429
Some things don't change.

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:20.289
Yeah.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.532
Well, Moco-chan's been doing her best to challenge herself to eat natto!

00:28:25.672 --> 00:28:26.212
I have!

00:28:26.553 --> 00:28:31.875
Yeah, and if you don't know what natto is, it's a very common breakfast food in Japan.

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:33.236
It's sort of pungent.

00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:38.999
Yeah, it's fermented soybeans, and it's kind of sticky and slimy and stinky.

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:41.320
But it's really, really, really good for you.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.741
Hi, I'm Moco-chan.

00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:44.562
Yeah, you want to be able to eat it today.

00:28:44.582 --> 00:28:44.822
I do!

00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:47.123
I confirm, Moco-chan.

00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:06.670
But last time, last time, Ruffians, Moco-chan did pretty well, right?

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.311
You beat a record.

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:09.252
Was it last time?

00:29:09.272 --> 00:29:09.832
I think so.

00:29:09.892 --> 00:29:11.293
You had eight, not two weeks.

00:29:11.373 --> 00:29:12.614
I think I have been doing very well.

00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:16.617
We've been doing this for much longer than eight weeks, but that's good.

00:29:17.437 --> 00:29:23.201
So, this time too, Moco-chan... This time too, Moco-chan!

00:29:23.781 --> 00:29:25.922
You're going to beat your best record, right?

00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:27.383
No.

00:29:27.764 --> 00:29:27.924
Yeah.

00:29:28.823 --> 00:29:30.767
You're gonna conquer it, okay?

00:29:31.248 --> 00:29:33.272
Conquer it just like a natto!

00:29:34.334 --> 00:29:34.634
Yeah.

00:29:35.015 --> 00:29:38.802
And then, you know... Hashi!

00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:46.796
Moco-chan, I kinda feel like you're a little bit ready for this today, no?

00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:48.818
I don't think so.

00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:54.363
One moment, I'm gonna stir it up and make it nice and fluffy and slimy!

00:29:54.403 --> 00:30:01.870
Like we talked about before, it's not the question of what don't we have yet, it's what do we have and...

00:30:02.731 --> 00:30:04.432
Soy sauce is not one of those things.

00:30:04.772 --> 00:30:05.253
Yeah.

00:30:05.793 --> 00:30:07.434
We don't have soy sauce.

00:30:08.094 --> 00:30:08.935
No shoyu.

00:30:09.095 --> 00:30:15.759
But what we do have, because Moco-chan, you could have just this usual straight raw.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:16.780
It smells different.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:26.686
But, well, we do have the oroshi nama shoga, the ginger.

00:30:28.007 --> 00:30:28.768
Ginger tube!

00:30:28.808 --> 00:30:30.269
Grated ginger!

00:30:30.869 --> 00:30:35.333
So, Moco-chan, you gonna have it with the ginger today?

00:30:35.353 --> 00:30:37.575
Let's try it with a bit of the ginger.

00:30:40.357 --> 00:30:41.858
Can you put a bit in there for me?

00:30:41.959 --> 00:30:43.700
No, you could- Oh, you want me to do it?

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.260
Just a bit.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.002
You have paws, you can do it!

00:30:47.103 --> 00:30:47.903
Please!

00:30:48.124 --> 00:30:49.305
Okay, Moco-chan, hold this.

00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:50.085
Hold this.

00:30:51.646 --> 00:30:52.747
How much should I put in?

00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:55.690
Moco-chan said a bit, but I really like it.

00:30:57.498 --> 00:30:57.979
Ginger?

00:30:58.019 --> 00:30:59.240
Is there something wrong with that?

00:30:59.260 --> 00:30:59.900
Stop, stop!

00:31:00.561 --> 00:31:03.324
That looks like a good amount to me.

00:31:03.344 --> 00:31:05.205
Is there?

00:31:05.325 --> 00:31:06.606
Am I eating ginger?

00:31:06.887 --> 00:31:07.808
Am I eating natto?

00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:10.010
Wow!

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.511
Okay, Moco-chan.

00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.712
Are you ready?

00:31:12.892 --> 00:31:14.113
You probably stir it in.

00:31:14.133 --> 00:31:14.173
No.

00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:15.294
No?

00:31:15.314 --> 00:31:15.835
Okay.

00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:19.306
Dip it in the ginger.

00:31:21.047 --> 00:31:21.848
Okay!

00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:23.489
Moco-chan.

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:24.870
First, before you eat.

00:31:25.491 --> 00:31:27.452
One second, there's lots of stickies.

00:31:29.994 --> 00:31:39.100
First, let's say thank you to the farmers in Canada and the United States of America who were taught to make this.

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:46.703
I know Ruffians.

00:31:47.664 --> 00:31:48.564
For some reason.

00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:51.226
It's not Tochigi.

00:31:52.587 --> 00:31:53.567
Yeah.

00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:59.151
It's hard to find some delicious Tochigi natto for next time.

00:31:59.171 --> 00:31:59.511
Right.

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:02.389
Yeah.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:03.770
Different farmers now.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.051
Different farmers, but this is the really, really good one.

00:32:07.351 --> 00:32:12.872
I thought, ah, I want to eat really, really nice natto, so I got the really nice one.

00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:14.173
It's so sticky.

00:32:14.353 --> 00:32:15.313
That's why it's so nice.

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.294
Why is it so sticky?

00:32:16.514 --> 00:32:20.255
And that's why it's from Canada and the United States of America.

00:32:20.275 --> 00:32:22.836
Oh no, the ginger is sort of melting into it.

00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:25.316
Why is it so sticky?

00:32:25.857 --> 00:32:26.997
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:32:27.697 --> 00:32:28.497
Itadakimasu.

00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:29.978
It's so sticky.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.400
I dipped one bean.

00:32:33.581 --> 00:32:36.041
I dipped the natto into the ginger.

00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:40.243
Mocomoco-chan.

00:32:41.243 --> 00:32:44.804
There is equal parts ginger, equal parts bean.

00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:48.705
That's a lot of ginger.

00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:50.286
Okay!

00:32:50.326 --> 00:32:51.766
Itadakimasu!

00:32:52.306 --> 00:32:53.987
Do I have pee?

00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:54.287
No.

00:32:58.688 --> 00:32:59.829
Pretty confident today.

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:03.078
No, no, no, no, don't, don't, the faces, don't.

00:33:03.238 --> 00:33:04.980
It tastes spicy!

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.963
That's just the ginger, did you taste the natto?

00:33:09.023 --> 00:33:10.584
It's spicy natto!

00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:12.326
It's spicy natto!

00:33:12.386 --> 00:33:15.148
Spicy natto, you taste that, it's flavorful!

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:16.730
No, that's spicy natto.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.631
No, try more, Moco-chan!

00:33:17.651 --> 00:33:20.033
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's spicy natto.

00:33:20.053 --> 00:33:23.356
Can I have tea?

00:33:23.956 --> 00:33:25.197
Let me try it.

00:33:25.217 --> 00:33:26.839
It's spicy natto.

00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:31.711
No.

00:33:32.992 --> 00:33:36.655
I like that.

00:33:36.715 --> 00:33:37.576
Spicy natto.

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:39.337
And the natto feels so good.

00:33:39.418 --> 00:33:40.558
I'm like, awake!

00:33:40.939 --> 00:33:41.439
Alive!

00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:45.342
Maybe it's because of the ginger, but I'm not, no.

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:48.365
No, the best part of the natto is the natto.

00:33:49.846 --> 00:33:50.286
I'm good.

00:33:51.187 --> 00:33:51.748
Thank you.

00:33:57.692 --> 00:33:58.133
It's good.

00:33:59.318 --> 00:34:02.040
I'm looking forward to eating the natto, Wiz!

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:05.502
Moco-chan, you're not gonna get any more?

00:34:05.702 --> 00:34:06.343
I eat one.

00:34:06.403 --> 00:34:08.764
That's nowhere near close to your last record.

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:12.046
Are you serious about this?

00:34:12.126 --> 00:34:12.967
It was still good.

00:34:13.247 --> 00:34:21.092
Ruffians, we'll do our best to challenge ourselves to something new.

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:25.955
And remember Moco-chan's best attempt at eating the natto covered in ginger?

00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:26.476
Yeah.

00:34:28.263 --> 00:34:29.771
BAU BAU!

00:34:34.323 --> 00:34:39.566
Next we have our... Doggie of the Day!

00:34:39.586 --> 00:34:44.470
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Peppa!

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.791
Peppa!

00:34:45.971 --> 00:34:46.271
Cute!

00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:50.434
She looks so comfy and ready to cuddle.

00:34:50.514 --> 00:34:51.014
Right?

00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:52.675
Lots of blankets.

00:34:53.796 --> 00:34:55.017
Who's the blanket?

00:34:55.037 --> 00:34:55.677
Who's Peppa?

00:34:55.697 --> 00:34:59.020
It's hard to tell, but Peppa loves...

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.020
CCC.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:07.983
She's a CC girl who loves camping, cuddles, and chasing cats.

00:35:08.103 --> 00:35:13.625
I wanna chase after cats with Peppa!

00:35:13.925 --> 00:35:15.866
Yeah, I wonder.

00:35:15.926 --> 00:35:19.327
Peppa looks like she could be even faster than you, Moco-chan.

00:35:20.747 --> 00:35:20.948
No.

00:35:21.988 --> 00:35:24.889
Well, how does Peppa BAU BAU?

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:27.430
BAU BAI!

00:35:28.769 --> 00:35:29.790
BAU BAU!

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.151
Like that.

00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:33.212
Even when she wants to cuddle.

00:35:33.452 --> 00:35:34.413
BAU BAU.

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:37.115
Just like that.

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.316
Just like that.

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:42.839
Yeah, well, I think we can all tell from this photo, but... Papa!

00:35:43.539 --> 00:35:45.341
She's a blast to be around.

00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:45.601
Yeah.

00:35:45.881 --> 00:35:48.163
Yeah, she's even better than Paparoni.

00:35:48.183 --> 00:35:50.564
Yeah, she can have my Paparoni.

00:35:51.165 --> 00:35:56.889
Tell her to make sure that she gives the cats a lot of kisses when she chases after them.

00:35:57.529 --> 00:36:01.690
For FUWAMOCO, kiss is dedicated for FUWAMOCO.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.911
BAU BAU!

00:36:06.252 --> 00:36:07.492
And next, Ruffians!

00:36:07.752 --> 00:36:09.533
You've been on lots of walks, right?

00:36:09.933 --> 00:36:15.834
And for today's I went on a walk, we have... De-den!

00:36:17.815 --> 00:36:18.775
Aquarium!

00:36:19.055 --> 00:36:21.096
Oh, you went to an aquarium!

00:36:21.116 --> 00:36:24.197
That sounds like so much fun!

00:36:26.195 --> 00:36:28.238
Penguins and alligators?

00:36:28.578 --> 00:36:29.960
Aquariums have fish?

00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:33.185
I guess they're kind of like friends with fish.

00:36:34.407 --> 00:36:35.288
They eat the fish.

00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:36.651
Friends?

00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:40.897
Well, the penguins and the alligators were in separate enclosures.

00:36:43.044 --> 00:36:43.884
I hope for their sakes.

00:36:44.344 --> 00:36:45.424
Yeah, I'm a fish.

00:36:45.905 --> 00:36:46.285
Yeah.

00:36:46.325 --> 00:36:46.605
Yeah.

00:36:46.945 --> 00:36:47.625
All separate.

00:36:47.865 --> 00:36:49.125
FUWAMOCO!

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:55.606
It's been a long time since we went to an aquarium, but Moco-chan!

00:36:55.666 --> 00:36:57.686
You really like the jellyfish, right?

00:36:58.047 --> 00:36:59.007
I like jellyfish.

00:36:59.107 --> 00:37:00.007
I like aquariums.

00:37:00.547 --> 00:37:03.688
You know, I just feel like I could watch jellyfish forever.

00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:08.288
They sort of remind me of living lavala.

00:37:08.428 --> 00:37:10.069
I also like to eat them.

00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.609
They're yummy.

00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:15.610
Maybe we can go to the aquarium sometime soon.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.970
We've never been to an aquarium in Japan before.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.751
BAU BAU!

00:37:23.831 --> 00:37:27.352
Next, we have our Question of the Day!

00:37:27.372 --> 00:37:30.873
Today's question is... De-den!

00:37:31.893 --> 00:37:34.554
How does one make a FUWAMOCO eat a pig?

00:37:34.954 --> 00:37:36.414
What color do I choose?

00:37:37.014 --> 00:37:38.415
Pink or blue?

00:37:38.816 --> 00:37:40.057
Why for Ruffians?

00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:41.217
Should I make two?

00:37:41.638 --> 00:37:42.899
But I don't want to split them up.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.221
It feels wrong.

00:37:45.321 --> 00:37:46.081
BAU BAU.

00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:47.903
Lots and lots of good questions.

00:37:48.003 --> 00:37:49.964
Yeah, but eat the bags!

00:37:50.405 --> 00:37:51.726
Ruffians, maybe there's some Ruffians.

00:37:51.746 --> 00:37:52.627
I should eat the bags.

00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:53.327
It's like a

00:37:54.448 --> 00:37:57.210
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.241
You know, Esme, you know, making it and designing it, I think it's up to you.

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:21.861
It's yours!

00:38:22.362 --> 00:38:27.903
You know, you could do blue or pink or both or add some white or purple or black.

00:38:28.323 --> 00:38:30.143
Yeah, do what you like best.

00:38:30.444 --> 00:38:34.825
You could even use like fluffy and fuzzy materials too, like fur.

00:38:35.065 --> 00:38:36.985
Yeah, lots of ideas.

00:38:37.005 --> 00:38:37.465
Ribbons!

00:38:37.805 --> 00:38:41.926
Yeah, ribbons too, you know, to show off you, your style.

00:38:41.946 --> 00:38:42.667
Exactly.

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:43.727
What you want to do.

00:38:44.748 --> 00:38:51.414
But we really hope that, you know, maybe soon we can release a bunch of cute merch and, you know, button badges soon.

00:38:51.474 --> 00:38:56.318
And then, that way, you can decorate your lovely ito bags with it!

00:38:56.338 --> 00:38:56.498
Yes!

00:38:56.518 --> 00:38:58.260
You know, it's the armor.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.341
Yeah, like armor.

00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:04.165
It's kind of, it's like an ito bag that stretches your entire body.

00:39:04.185 --> 00:39:05.926
It's awesome too!

00:39:05.947 --> 00:39:07.728
You know, we can protect not just your smile, but

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:10.310
Your body too.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:17.513
I wanna see you eat the arm okay, Ruffians!

00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:18.713
Mix the bump.

00:39:20.314 --> 00:39:21.394
Ready for battle.

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:22.195
BAU BAU!

00:39:22.295 --> 00:39:26.337
Good luck with the eat-a-bag!

00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:31.419
BAU BAU, thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:39.284
I know FUWAMOCO Morning is back, and we're so happy to be able to be there with you during your morning.

00:39:39.344 --> 00:39:48.670
But, well, like we say, FUWAMOCO Morning is something we make together, so we're always looking forward to more doggy of the days, you know?

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.732
To see the kind of walks that you're going on, and where you're visiting.

00:39:53.092 --> 00:39:55.394
I'm sure there's lots of questions.

00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:56.675
There's been a lot going on.

00:39:57.375 --> 00:39:59.156
And Pero Sightings too.

00:39:59.576 --> 00:39:59.736
Right?

00:39:59.796 --> 00:40:00.597
And also!

00:40:00.617 --> 00:40:02.958
We have the FUWAMOCO Scoop too.

00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:07.240
Maybe there's been some things that FUWAMOCO, you know, we've been busy deeming done.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.543
Maybe there's some interesting news from us so far that we kinda missed.

00:40:12.063 --> 00:40:15.845
Please let us know with the hashtag FWMCScoop.

00:40:15.945 --> 00:40:20.788
And for all your other submissions, please use the hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:40:20.808 --> 00:40:21.188
BAU BAU!

00:40:26.983 --> 00:40:32.411
That was definitely the silliest face you've made while sneezing, Moco-chan.

00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:34.313
You didn't see anything, Ruffians!

00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:34.774
Beautiful!

00:40:34.814 --> 00:40:35.275
BAU BAU!

00:40:44.747 --> 00:40:48.031
We have another stream coming up soon, right Moco-chan?

00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:51.835
For our next stream we have De-den!

00:40:52.015 --> 00:40:56.280
Tonight we're going to be reading your superchats.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.984
Thank you so much, Ruffians.

00:40:59.044 --> 00:41:01.426
Thank you for all your lovely superchats.

00:41:01.486 --> 00:41:03.329
Thank you for the sneeze tags!

00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:07.731
And thank you for all the messages while we were busy on our quests.

00:41:08.412 --> 00:41:11.894
You know, it really gave us so much power to keep on going.

00:41:11.954 --> 00:41:13.575
Yeah, you have no idea.

00:41:13.855 --> 00:41:14.995
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:41:15.036 --> 00:41:17.057
We're looking forward to chatting lots!

00:41:18.252 --> 00:41:18.773
BAU BAU!

00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:39.964
We're also gonna be playing Donkey Kong Country 2!

00:41:41.005 --> 00:41:43.966
On the original SNES this time.

00:41:44.066 --> 00:41:49.928
So we hope that you'll join us for a lot of silly times to come very soon.

00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:51.929
And of course we're back to Advent Club too!

00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:54.330
We're playing content warning!

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.512
And we have a Rock n' Rawr Party coming up too.

00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:01.713
So we hope you'll join us this week for a bunch of fun!

00:42:02.233 --> 00:42:04.094
Which is so exciting, Ruffians!

00:42:04.114 --> 00:42:05.795

00:42:07.656 --> 00:42:08.897

Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for the first FUWAMOCO Morning in quite a while!

00:42:18.824 --> 00:42:21.246
Do you feel good to be back, Moco-chan?

00:42:22.284 --> 00:42:22.784
Yeah!

00:42:22.824 --> 00:42:25.485
Of course I'm happy!

00:42:25.505 --> 00:42:27.165
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:42:27.205 --> 00:42:31.806
We hope we can be a part of your morning regularly from here on out.

00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:39.747
But, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:39.807

And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl of a day!

00:43:25.396 --> 00:43:28.077
This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:44:11.229 --> 00:44:12.429
Hey, Ruff Friends!

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.430
Did you forget about me?

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.851
Well, I should better dog-dine hope not.

00:44:19.552 --> 00:44:21.172
I'm the Great Perroccino!

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:24.793
But, I guess you can just call me Pero, right?

00:44:25.593 --> 00:44:26.854
We're close after all.

00:44:27.514 --> 00:44:29.655
Pals even, dare I say.

00:44:29.675 --> 00:44:31.315
FUWAMOCO!

00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:37.337
You know, they might have moved to Japan, but that doesn't mean I'm not around here and there.

00:44:38.037 --> 00:44:40.598
You know me, I like to explore.

00:44:41.288 --> 00:44:42.989
I see the whole world.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.614
Maybe I'm not even too far from where you are.

00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:52.518
Well, Ruffians, I know your true feelings.

00:44:53.919 --> 00:44:55.921
I know you like me.

00:44:57.002 --> 00:44:59.464
You want to spend more time together, right?

00:45:00.265 --> 00:45:00.765
Go ahead.

00:45:01.486 --> 00:45:03.427
Speak your heart's true desires.

00:45:04.448 --> 00:45:06.890
After all, I'm the Great Perroccino.

00:45:08.007 --> 00:45:11.031
I'm not some little pupper like the FUWAMOCO girl he is.

00:45:12.213 --> 00:45:17.100
Well, I hope we can become even better, closer pals in the future.

00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:20.545
Get used to this beautiful mug, you hear me?

00:45:20.565 --> 00:45:22.828
See you later, Ruffians!

00:45:22.968 --> 00:45:23.349
Ciao!
