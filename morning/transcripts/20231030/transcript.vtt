05:19.898 --> 05:26.861
Hello, hello, Halloween!

05:26.941 --> 05:27.641
One more time.

05:27.682 --> 05:28.142
Hello, hello, Halloween!

05:28.182 --> 05:28.322
BAU!

05:28.842 --> 05:29.042
BAU!

05:29.102 --> 05:37.606
It's time for FUWAMOCO Midnight!

05:50.253 --> 05:55.563
FUWAMOCO Midnight hajimaru yo!

06:01.362 --> 06:04.184
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

06:04.584 --> 06:07.045
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

06:07.146 --> 06:09.887
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

06:09.947 --> 06:11.528
BAU BAU!

06:12.008 --> 06:18.672
And today we're your spooky hosts of FUWAMOCO Midnight, the Halloween special!

06:19.192 --> 06:27.197
Thank you for joining us, Ruffians, for such a spooky, spooky time of the year!

06:28.478 --> 06:29.218
BAU BAU!

06:31.735 --> 06:43.339
For any Ruffians joining us for the first time today, FUWAMOCO Midnight is a short format morning show held this Halloween week.

06:44.799 --> 06:45.439
And it's hosted by us!

06:58.542 --> 07:00.803
FUWAMOCO!

07:01.343 --> 07:08.486
Our aim is to send shivers down your spine and help you start your day off with some Halloween spirit!

07:08.826 --> 07:09.867
And maybe some candy.

07:10.287 --> 07:11.408
Maybe, maybe.

07:11.448 --> 07:13.608
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

07:14.049 --> 07:17.650
Hashtag FWMCMIDNIGHT.

07:17.790 --> 07:18.310
Midnight.

07:19.967 --> 07:25.750
Let's all say BAU BAU to a very spooky FUWAMOCO Midnight!

07:25.770 --> 07:25.830
BAU!

07:26.410 --> 07:28.231
BAU!

07:28.271 --> 07:29.491
BAU!

07:29.631 --> 07:32.392
It doesn't have the same ring as BAU BAU.

07:33.893 --> 07:35.334
I only see a few BAU BAUs.

07:35.754 --> 07:36.514
BAU BAU.

07:36.554 --> 07:37.335
Ruffians!

07:37.775 --> 07:39.195
It sounds like we're all crying a bit.

07:39.435 --> 07:47.299
BAU BAU is better.

07:48.750 --> 07:49.650
We can all agree on that.

07:49.810 --> 07:53.291
BAU BAU.

07:53.651 --> 08:00.693
You know, Halloween's so close, but... but... was... Did anybody see Pero?

08:01.193 --> 08:04.474
It's kind of hard, maybe he blended in with all the ghosts at this time of year.

08:04.794 --> 08:08.115
When Ruffians saw, was he... de-den!

08:09.735 --> 08:12.696
Spooky!

08:12.836 --> 08:17.197
Wait, so Pero came by and threatened you so then he could get some candy?

08:19.015 --> 08:23.738
It's a good thing he wasn't too brave and ran off when you told him to scram, you know?

08:23.939 --> 08:26.740
You must be a very rough and tough looking Ruffian!

08:26.781 --> 08:27.981
Make him listen!

08:28.141 --> 08:31.204
Either that or your costume scared him off maybe?

08:31.484 --> 08:31.824
Maybe.

08:32.104 --> 08:36.707
But I think this is a very creative way of remembering that encounter.

08:36.747 --> 08:40.910
Yeah, it's important to make physical evidence of the crime.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.190
Crime?

08:41.631 --> 08:42.731
The crime committed!

08:44.807 --> 08:47.229
Well, there was no crime, but it doesn't matter.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.731
It was scary.

08:49.371 --> 08:50.352
It was spooky.

08:50.913 --> 08:52.114
You felt unwell, right?

08:52.154 --> 08:52.634
Unwell.

08:52.735 --> 08:58.560
But that aside, that's a very beautiful pumpkin.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.545
Maybe the whole idea also gave you some well-deserved pumpkin inspiration.

09:04.205 --> 09:08.730
I don't know, I think... I really like this pumpkin.

09:09.834 --> 09:10.875
It looks sort of soft.

09:10.955 --> 09:11.836
It looks sort of fuzzy.

09:11.996 --> 09:12.376
Right!

09:12.476 --> 09:17.119
I think, you know, this pumpkin is the perfect pumpkin for the job, for your carving.

09:17.919 --> 09:18.760
Good canvas.

09:18.820 --> 09:19.020
Right?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.421
It looks very happy.

09:20.541 --> 09:26.405
I know you can see all the effort and sweat and blood that you put into it too.

09:26.425 --> 09:27.205
Spooky.

09:27.265 --> 09:28.246
Spooky.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.748
Watch out, Peron!

09:31.676 --> 09:33.678
It rhymes with being overlooked, okay?

09:34.859 --> 09:41.784
BAU BAU for the beautiful pumpkin!

09:41.864 --> 09:46.428
Speaking of boo... Speaking of boo... We have another.

09:47.569 --> 09:49.490
A bee boo.

09:50.551 --> 09:53.073
Ruffians!

09:53.854 --> 09:57.157
There's already been some Halloween tweets given out, but...

09:58.206 --> 09:59.647
You didn't miss it, right?

09:59.707 --> 10:01.188
You didn't miss out on it, right?

10:02.329 --> 10:05.932
Well, Advent Sparkling Jump!

10:06.352 --> 10:10.656
Kouseki Bizu just released our second cover song!

10:10.716 --> 10:12.177
Brand new song cover!

10:12.397 --> 10:13.238
I love it!

10:13.998 --> 10:17.361
It's super spooky and... Can you guess what love is?

10:19.406 --> 10:21.387
We absolutely love it!

10:21.407 --> 10:22.208
We love it!

10:22.908 --> 10:23.889
We love it, love it.

10:23.969 --> 10:25.110
We love it, love it.

10:25.370 --> 10:28.071
You know, you can really see how hard Bijou worked on it.

10:28.652 --> 10:34.935
And through this song, you can really see a different side of her that's really cool and sort of cute, sort of creepy.

10:34.955 --> 10:35.636
Sort of cute.

10:36.176 --> 10:36.917
Sort of cute.

10:37.177 --> 10:38.017
A bit scary.

10:39.358 --> 10:43.220
I feel like with both songs, Biboo makes them her own.

10:43.501 --> 10:43.981
Right?

10:44.041 --> 10:47.123
But this is a totally different Biboo that we haven't seen.

10:47.803 --> 10:50.064
I see some Ruffians thinking weird things.

10:50.725 --> 10:55.006
I don't know, it's kind of... In one way, intoxicating, no?

11:00.209 --> 11:00.869
Why silence?

11:02.090 --> 11:02.730
Why silence?

11:06.042 --> 11:07.003
What a Ruffian!

11:08.103 --> 11:09.143
Are you scared?

11:10.844 --> 11:14.725
Please, please absolutely check out Biboo's new cover!

11:14.765 --> 11:15.745
She rocked it.

11:15.765 --> 11:16.545
She rocked it.

11:17.266 --> 11:18.506
Rock, rock, rock, rock.

11:19.126 --> 11:19.706
Ruffians.

11:33.462 --> 11:40.791
We heard from you recently that there's something that's been sending some shivers down your spine.

11:41.311 --> 11:42.132
Do you know what that is?

11:42.152 --> 11:46.317
There's a lot of things, but this in particular.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.420
The concept of

11:48.840 --> 11:50.602
BAU time.

11:51.022 --> 11:51.883
BAU time.

11:52.263 --> 11:55.426
Even us, FUWAMOCO, we've been feeling it too.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.167
Yeah!

11:56.467 --> 11:56.807
Yeah.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.228
Yeah.

11:58.409 --> 11:58.569
Yeah!

11:58.929 --> 12:05.074
Have you felt, you know, the past three months since we debuted, time has gone like super duper duper fast, right?

12:05.094 --> 12:10.139
But it also kind of feels like it's been like a really long time at the same time, like fast and long.

12:11.372 --> 12:18.514
I don't know how it works like that, but, you know, I feel like we've been feeling BAU time extremely much.

12:18.734 --> 12:21.154
And it's sort of frightening.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.735
Just sort of frightening.

12:24.835 --> 12:27.056
It's been so much fun together.

12:28.136 --> 12:31.997
So it's kind of like we lost track of time, but then also not at all.

12:33.497 --> 12:33.898
It's weird.

12:34.358 --> 12:36.219
It's a weird state to be in, Ruffians.

12:36.319 --> 12:40.542
Yeah, the concept of BAU time, I think it's very complex.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.445
And because it's so complex, it's really frightening.

12:44.505 --> 12:45.365
It's terrifying!

12:45.445 --> 12:45.625
Right?

12:45.705 --> 12:47.046
It's been three months!

12:48.047 --> 12:51.089
Yeah, your BAU time, too.

12:51.149 --> 12:52.870
Yesterday was yesterday, yo.

12:52.930 --> 12:55.112
It was, but what was yesterday?

12:55.172 --> 12:56.372
When did today start?

12:56.432 --> 12:57.653
When did yesterday end?

12:57.973 --> 12:58.414
Exactly.

13:00.598 --> 13:02.059
It's frightening.

13:02.079 --> 13:02.659
Yeah.

13:02.959 --> 13:09.863
But, you know, for FUWAMOCO, there are a lot of things that we're afraid of, but... You say that like it's something to be proud of.

13:09.883 --> 13:10.324
It's a fact.

13:10.684 --> 13:11.264
It's a fact.

13:11.604 --> 13:12.265
No denying.

13:12.405 --> 13:13.145
No denying.

13:13.365 --> 13:18.108
But right now, I think BAU time is what we're scared of the most.

13:19.369 --> 13:20.950
It's not a time loop, it's just...

13:21.767 --> 13:27.809
It's like... It's fast, but that's the sound of it going by.

13:27.829 --> 13:29.829
I don't know.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.710
It's like long but short.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.270
I know.

13:33.791 --> 13:34.331
I don't know.

13:34.751 --> 13:37.652
But maybe time will go back to normal soon?

13:37.852 --> 13:38.312
Maybe.

13:39.092 --> 13:46.994
The fun times together will absolutely continue, but hopefully time returns sort of back to normal, back to how it was.

13:47.154 --> 13:48.655
Do you think you will, Ruffians?

13:50.202 --> 13:51.643
It goes like that, like really fast.

13:53.304 --> 13:54.065
You know the car.

13:54.225 --> 13:54.505
Not a cat.

13:54.706 --> 13:56.807
Are you sure that's not a Minecraft cat?

13:57.207 --> 13:57.368
No.

13:58.849 --> 13:59.930
Imagine the race car.

13:59.950 --> 14:02.512
It goes... Like that.

14:02.632 --> 14:04.053
Yeah, but that's a fast car.

14:04.213 --> 14:04.493
Yes!

14:05.134 --> 14:05.854
It goes fast.

14:06.174 --> 14:08.156
But it also goes, like, slow?

14:08.216 --> 14:11.138
I don't know, it's like... It's fast and thick.

14:11.759 --> 14:12.860
I don't know.

14:14.201 --> 14:14.981
That's BAU time.

14:15.001 --> 14:15.542
Yeah.

14:15.682 --> 14:16.783
Be scared, okay, Ruffians?

14:20.864 --> 14:22.766
Spooky things be happening.

14:22.786 --> 14:23.367
Spooky.

14:23.967 --> 14:32.416
But... I think Moco-chan, you might have a confession to make just in time for Halloween.

14:32.896 --> 14:33.377
I might.

14:34.538 --> 14:37.661
Ruffians, it's a little scary.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.181
Do you think that you're ready to hear it?

14:42.941 --> 14:44.042
Is your heart ready?

14:44.782 --> 14:50.425
If you're holding any drinks, maybe you should put them down before you drop them or swallow the candy.

14:50.525 --> 14:52.986
No choking, okay?

14:54.206 --> 14:56.047
Are you ready?

14:56.087 --> 14:58.308
Maybe it's pretty scary.

15:00.549 --> 15:03.830
Well, ready or not, here I speak.

15:04.150 --> 15:04.190
So,

15:10.020 --> 15:12.161
Maybe you noticed it.

15:13.522 --> 15:16.163
Maybe some of the sharp Ruffians sharp.

15:17.724 --> 15:20.966
But maybe some other ones haven't.

15:21.066 --> 15:21.666
That's okay.

15:23.327 --> 15:27.930
Have you noticed the spectacular shape of my mouth?

15:31.592 --> 15:36.374
You see, it's sort of round, but then it has two sort of ear shapes to it.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.486
The ear shapes are Moco-chan's teeth.

15:41.526 --> 15:42.047
You see?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.968
Like that.

15:44.108 --> 15:44.549
I see.

15:45.249 --> 15:47.571
But, there's actually a reason for it.

15:47.651 --> 15:48.151
It's cute.

15:48.852 --> 15:49.853
There's a reason, okay?

15:49.873 --> 15:50.833
It's not just cute.

15:51.014 --> 15:53.676
I know.

15:55.017 --> 16:03.923
It's because... It's the perfect size to fit... A KITTEN HEAD!

16:04.444 --> 16:04.604
See?

16:06.648 --> 16:06.768
See?

16:06.848 --> 16:07.949
It looks like a kitten's head.

16:10.110 --> 16:11.010
It really does.

16:11.510 --> 16:12.891
And you know what they say.

16:13.271 --> 16:16.913
If a cat can fit its head through a hole, then it can fit its whole body through too, right?

16:16.953 --> 16:18.333
That's what they say.

16:18.393 --> 16:19.494
It's the same as my mouth!

16:19.754 --> 16:20.494
It's perfect.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.275
You get it, right, Ruffians?

16:30.658 --> 16:32.499
Just kidding!

16:34.844 --> 16:40.527
You know, when we talk about eating kittens, I don't mean it like that.

16:42.108 --> 16:42.268
No.

16:42.569 --> 16:49.012
I just like to rub my face all over them and then kiss them lots and then huff their tummies and whatnot.

16:49.473 --> 16:49.893
That's all.

16:50.873 --> 16:52.414
It's practically eating them, you know?

16:53.675 --> 16:54.015
Right!

16:58.038 --> 16:58.398
Right.

17:01.240 --> 17:01.660
Right!

17:04.108 --> 17:04.688
Sure.

17:09.171 --> 17:10.872
You have to believe me to get the treat.

17:11.692 --> 17:14.834
The treat.

17:14.954 --> 17:16.235
Moco-chan's treat.

17:16.855 --> 17:19.397
Cats are friends, but why can't you eat them too?

17:24.960 --> 17:28.742
Well, I'm sure you never thought anything sinister, right?

17:29.042 --> 17:29.823
We love cats.

17:31.344 --> 17:32.985
Just wanna kiss and smell them.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.426
That's all.

17:35.386 --> 17:35.746
Right?

17:36.587 --> 17:37.467
Right.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.089
That's kinda scary.

17:43.230 --> 17:51.113
BAU BAU!

17:53.514 --> 17:54.775
Ruffians!

17:56.736 --> 17:59.017
There's something that I've been wondering.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.560
Have you remembered yet?

18:05.521 --> 18:06.082
Have you?

18:07.102 --> 18:12.524
There's a very special day coming up that you better remember.

18:13.344 --> 18:14.365
We talked about it.

18:14.845 --> 18:15.105
Yeah.

18:15.325 --> 18:18.066
You better remember it.

18:19.607 --> 18:20.047
I know.

18:21.207 --> 18:24.609
It's been over a week since we mentioned it last, right?

18:25.249 --> 18:27.090
You definitely know by now, right?

18:28.826 --> 18:29.786
There's no way you wouldn't know.

18:29.806 --> 18:30.927
You thought about it, right?

18:32.987 --> 18:33.307
Right?

18:33.407 --> 18:34.128
Very soon.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.588
It's really important to us.

18:35.608 --> 18:36.588
We set it up soon.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.669
It's really, really important.

18:39.929 --> 18:40.750
Hello, fans.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.531
You know what's important to us.

18:46.351 --> 18:47.892
What's important to FUWAMOCO.

18:47.932 --> 18:54.354
I thought the Ruffians knew, but... I don't know.

18:54.374 --> 18:54.674
Well, that's...

18:56.440 --> 18:59.181
More important than the cover song to FUWAMOCO.

18:59.701 --> 19:05.943
Well, we were asked if anyone figured it out yet.

19:06.863 --> 19:07.243
Yeah.

19:07.523 --> 19:11.324
And we saw one Ruffian guess it.

19:11.724 --> 19:12.465
One.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.125
One singular Ruffian.

19:14.185 --> 19:14.565
Yeah.

19:15.065 --> 19:16.986
But I don't think they even realized it then.

19:17.346 --> 19:17.526
Nope.

19:18.966 --> 19:20.167
Isn't that a bit scary?

19:21.247 --> 19:23.248
Maybe a bit spooky?

19:25.313 --> 19:28.154
Doesn't it make your hair stand on end a little bit?

19:36.058 --> 19:36.318
BAU!

19:38.679 --> 19:42.281
You better think of it!

19:42.921 --> 19:48.624
If the Ruffians don't remember soon... Moco-chan... How should we punish them?

19:50.364 --> 19:51.405
We'll have to think of that.

19:51.845 --> 19:53.486
We'll think of that while you think.

19:54.591 --> 20:06.357
Think hard, okay?

20:06.737 --> 20:12.000
We might have to play a trick on you pretty soon, but first... Do they deserve it though?

20:12.100 --> 20:13.661
I don't know.

20:13.901 --> 20:15.702
But first we'll give you a treat!

20:15.922 --> 20:17.163
Do they deserve it though?

20:23.378 --> 20:33.770
Today at 5pm PT, 9am JST, we have our second cover song premiering on YouTube!

20:34.070 --> 20:36.313
We're super excited for you to listen to it!

20:37.731 --> 20:41.353
You know, we'll also be having an afterparty after the song premiere.

20:41.753 --> 20:47.576
So we hope that you'll come and join us and share your thoughts with us about it there too.

20:47.656 --> 20:55.979
You know, but... I think, I think... I think you know that we haven't shared what song it is with you yet.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.080
Did you realize?

21:00.842 --> 21:01.802
Did you wanna find out?

21:07.071 --> 21:07.871
No, not yet.

21:08.111 --> 21:09.011
You don't wanna know yet.

21:14.332 --> 21:18.873
Well, maybe the Ruffians... Maybe we should make them act like ghosts.

21:19.473 --> 21:23.974
And say BAU BAU for us if you wanna find out.

21:26.234 --> 21:27.975
Can you BAU BAU for me?

21:32.535 --> 21:33.335
BAU!

21:33.375 --> 21:33.756
BAU!

21:34.096 --> 21:34.516
BAU!

21:34.536 --> 21:35.056
BAU!

21:35.296 --> 21:35.756
Not moo.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.556
FUWAMOCO-chan!

21:39.576 --> 21:42.543
I guess.

21:45.969 --> 21:50.252
Our second cover song is... De-den!

21:50.492 --> 21:54.635
Cute na Kanojo!

21:54.735 --> 21:56.936
BAU BAU!

21:56.996 --> 22:03.020
It's a song originally by Shudo, but very cute and very creepy.

22:04.061 --> 22:07.883
We hope you enjoy FUWAMOCO version very soon.

22:08.504 --> 22:11.626
You know, cause we're always watching, right?

22:12.727 --> 22:13.087
You know?

22:16.431 --> 22:19.092
BAU BAU!

22:20.492 --> 22:22.073
I'm excited.

22:23.113 --> 22:25.754
Ruffians, we look forward to it!

22:26.674 --> 22:35.717
Well, you know, since Halloween is only a day away, we thought that we'd share one of our earliest Halloween memories with you.

22:35.777 --> 22:40.199
You know, as you might remember from I think it was our

22:40.479 --> 22:42.600
Collab with Calli-senpai, right?

22:42.620 --> 22:45.802
But Halloween is one of our favorite holidays, even though we don't like scary things.

22:46.303 --> 22:49.545
And it's been like that forever!

22:49.865 --> 22:53.868
You know, they celebrate very similarly in the Northwest Passage too.

22:53.908 --> 22:55.709
Yeah, as the humans, you know?

22:56.189 --> 23:06.115
So, well... Back when we were just tiny puppers, Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy, they decided to take us to see some fireworks.

23:08.237 --> 23:08.337
And...

23:09.267 --> 23:12.029
After we did some trick-or-treating, we went and did that, you know?

23:12.189 --> 23:20.773
We were tired, so... But we were told that we could only eat one candy out of all the trick-or-treating candies we had gathered!

23:21.294 --> 23:24.295
So we picked them and took them with us, you know?

23:24.495 --> 23:25.376
Yeah, ate the one.

23:25.936 --> 23:26.477
Yeah.

23:27.137 --> 23:28.758
But when we got to the fireworks...

23:30.494 --> 23:32.515
Of course, we're still really little.

23:32.856 --> 23:33.876
Just little puppers, right?

23:34.457 --> 23:40.520
So Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy, they picked us up and put us on their shoulders so that we could see the fireworks a little bit better.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.482
And then what happened, Fuwawa?

23:45.763 --> 23:53.287
Well, Ruffians, you know, when the fireworks exploded to the sky, they're really beautiful, right?

23:55.429 --> 23:57.310
What do you do when that happens, you know?

23:58.817 --> 24:00.518
The fireworks go BABAM BABAO.

24:01.418 --> 24:06.942
And then you go... BAAAAAAA!

24:07.282 --> 24:07.542
Right?

24:07.902 --> 24:08.222
Right.

24:10.083 --> 24:10.343
Right!

24:11.304 --> 24:12.725
Right!

24:12.845 --> 24:15.446
In the Northwest Passage it goes BAAA!

24:15.646 --> 24:17.327
And fireworks are at Halloween.

24:17.387 --> 24:18.588
Yeah, right.

24:18.908 --> 24:25.252
But, uh, well... Nobody had really realized that what I chose as my candy was bubble gum.

24:26.189 --> 24:30.493
And of course you know the fireworks being so amazing and everything!

24:30.513 --> 24:36.299
It might have just made me lose my gum that I was chewing!

24:36.839 --> 24:40.163
And I dropped it right into Mama Puppy's hair.

24:40.183 --> 24:41.604
Yeah.

24:44.307 --> 24:45.308
She was very surprised.

24:45.468 --> 24:46.669
Very very surprised.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.681
Yeah, I... I still kinda feel bad for her.

24:51.841 --> 24:52.921
I don't think she's forgotten.

24:54.361 --> 24:54.401
No!

24:54.901 --> 24:57.922
But you know, sometimes fireworks are just too pretty!

24:57.942 --> 24:59.182
Yeah, you can't help it, right?

24:59.443 --> 25:02.043
It's an easy mistake no matter how old you are, you know?

25:02.083 --> 25:02.963
I'm sure, right.

25:03.483 --> 25:07.324
Although I don't think the same thing would happen if you're... ...older, right?

25:10.505 --> 25:11.305
Mochomoco-chan.

25:11.425 --> 25:14.646
And that's a story.

25:19.454 --> 25:22.436
Ruffians, have you had a similar experience before?

25:22.456 --> 25:24.797
Did she get her fur shaved?

25:25.378 --> 25:29.920
Well, you know, Mama Puppy's pretty fluffy, pretty fuzzy, so it wasn't easy.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.741
It wasn't good.

25:31.661 --> 25:35.884
Yeah, it wasn't good.

25:35.904 --> 25:37.765
But thinking about Mama Puppy, guys!

25:38.805 --> 25:39.106
Yeah.

25:39.846 --> 25:41.507
Mama Puppy's not the Doggie of the Day.

25:41.587 --> 25:41.787
No.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.729
But it's Doggie of the Day!

25:44.849 --> 25:45.890
We have!

25:46.050 --> 25:46.190
Wait.

25:46.830 --> 25:47.971
Today's doggy of the night.

25:48.786 --> 25:49.647
Doggy of the Night.

25:49.787 --> 25:50.227
Oh, whoops.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.288
Doggy of the Night!

25:52.688 --> 25:54.489
What do you mean whoops, Moco-chan?

25:54.769 --> 25:54.950
Whoops.

25:55.330 --> 26:00.593
Today's Doggy of the Night is... B-Man!

26:00.793 --> 26:02.834
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

26:02.934 --> 26:03.755
B-Man!

26:03.795 --> 26:04.155
B-Man.

26:05.296 --> 26:06.676
Yeah.

26:07.337 --> 26:09.198
Do we have a wedding coming with B-Man?

26:10.318 --> 26:13.280
I guess he's not too good with scary things, huh?

26:13.380 --> 26:14.301
No, no.

26:15.290 --> 26:17.031
I don't know what to do with the zombie head.

26:17.351 --> 26:19.111
B-man's kind of frozen.

26:21.292 --> 26:26.734
But regardless of bone or gristle, us dogs won't and don't chew on anything and everything, you know?

26:27.914 --> 26:30.675
Don't you imagine us doing those things like that either, okay?

26:31.876 --> 26:36.477
And I don't know if B-man does that, but certainly not us, okay?

26:37.338 --> 26:37.758
Manners.

26:41.539 --> 26:43.580
You made the zombie head yourself!

26:43.800 --> 26:44.020
Why?

26:45.911 --> 26:46.772
That's... Why?

26:46.792 --> 26:49.454
Horrifying animation.

26:49.815 --> 26:51.136
You don't... Do you need that?

26:51.156 --> 26:52.337
A zombie head?

26:53.838 --> 26:55.260
I guess to celebrate Halloween, right?

26:55.640 --> 26:56.381
I don't know.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.383
You could just have a happy looking pumpkin, right?

27:00.364 --> 27:00.684
I guess.

27:01.465 --> 27:04.288
Well, how does B-man BAU BAU?

27:04.808 --> 27:08.491
If B-man saw a zombie coming towards them, what would they sound like?

27:11.734 --> 27:12.075
Really?

27:17.403 --> 27:17.683
BAU!

27:17.703 --> 27:23.225
That was a bit scary there, but wouldn't it sound more like something a bit more alarming, like BAU!

27:23.645 --> 27:24.045
BAU!

27:24.625 --> 27:24.805

27:39.250 --> 27:39.350
BAU!

27:39.390 --> 27:39.550
BAU!

27:39.570 --> 27:39.630
BAU!

27:39.650 --> 27:39.851
BAU!

27:39.931 --> 27:40.291
BAU!

27:40.751 --> 27:40.871
BAU!

27:40.891 --> 27:41.011
BAU!

27:41.031 --> 27:41.171
BAU!

27:41.211 --> 27:41.471
BAU!

27:41.531 --> 27:41.631
BAU

27:48.214 --> 27:51.116
I think we can tell that they still love you regardless.

27:51.596 --> 27:52.757
Good for it for B-man.

27:54.278 --> 27:59.141
But I think B-man might like to request that you make something not so scary.

27:59.782 --> 28:05.205
Maybe preferably something that they could kind of take a bite and chew on comfortably.

28:05.225 --> 28:05.305
Chew.

28:05.345 --> 28:05.545
Chew.

28:05.605 --> 28:06.266
It's good.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.034
BAU BAU!

28:12.134 --> 28:15.976
Happy Halloween together!

28:16.456 --> 28:18.137
We're at Walk of the Night.

28:18.377 --> 28:19.638
Walk of the Night.

28:21.599 --> 28:23.200
Is that a walk?

28:23.580 --> 28:25.781
A scary night out?

28:26.021 --> 28:28.182
You went to Dracula's castle?

28:28.202 --> 28:30.184
Did you go inside of it?

28:31.464 --> 28:32.505
With your bag?

28:33.965 --> 28:34.386
Mommy.

28:36.475 --> 28:37.956
I don't know.

28:37.976 --> 28:45.841
We actually... For some reason, we don't know much about Dracula because vampires are scary.

28:45.922 --> 28:47.362
They're scary.

28:47.883 --> 28:48.043
Yeah.

28:48.303 --> 28:54.567
And, you know, they're local, so... You say that you're not a vampire, but... I don't know.

28:54.968 --> 28:57.890
Ruffians do... Do vampires tell stories to try and trick you?

28:57.970 --> 29:01.192
Are they those kind of... Those kind of scary ones?

29:01.292 --> 29:01.692
Yeah.

29:03.313 --> 29:03.673
Are they?

29:04.334 --> 29:04.914
I don't know.

29:04.934 --> 29:05.835
Can we trust you?

29:06.522 --> 29:11.584
Maybe... Maybe we should do... I don't know.

29:11.964 --> 29:13.765
I don't know.

29:14.065 --> 29:15.606
We'll see it now!

29:16.006 --> 29:17.146
No touching the fluff!

29:17.346 --> 29:18.807
No touching the fuzz!

29:19.367 --> 29:20.207
And a new one!

29:20.828 --> 29:22.829
No biting either the fuzz!

29:23.589 --> 29:24.089
Got it.

29:24.729 --> 29:24.929
Yeah.

29:25.350 --> 29:25.870
It's new.

29:26.070 --> 29:28.191
You have to remember, no biting.

29:28.251 --> 29:28.811
No biting.

29:28.931 --> 29:29.751
Yeah.

29:29.891 --> 29:30.612
Proper manners.

29:30.952 --> 29:32.692
BAU BAU!

29:35.327 --> 29:40.295
And for our question of the night, we have De-den!

29:41.943 --> 29:43.403
It says night.

29:43.443 --> 29:43.924
Night.

29:43.964 --> 29:44.184
Night.

29:44.764 --> 29:46.224
Hello FUWAMOCO!

29:46.404 --> 29:46.824
Hello!

29:46.844 --> 29:47.845
I have a question.

29:48.105 --> 29:50.966
We see BAU BAU and BAU BAU.

29:51.546 --> 29:53.546
Are there any more types of BAU BAU?

29:53.806 --> 29:56.567
For example, BAU BAU or BAU BAU?

29:57.507 --> 29:59.528
If there are, what do they mean?

29:59.728 --> 30:03.349
Well, I think BAU BAU and BAU BAU.

30:03.689 --> 30:04.069
Yeah.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.149
This wouldn't make sense, right?

30:05.189 --> 30:07.750
Those are like the universal BAU BAUs, right?

30:07.970 --> 30:09.651
It's like... BAU BAU!

30:09.831 --> 30:10.071
Yeah.

30:10.391 --> 30:10.511
And...

30:11.072 --> 30:11.613
BAU BAU!

30:11.653 --> 30:14.118
But there is BAU BAU.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.642
It's just BAU BAU.

30:22.621 --> 30:23.121
I got it.

30:23.241 --> 30:26.462
I think it's a bit more difficult for humans to understand, right?

30:26.822 --> 30:27.343
And then BAU BAU?

30:27.383 --> 30:28.343
It's a bit impolite.

30:28.683 --> 30:29.163
BAU BAU?

30:29.503 --> 30:31.464
So it's like you're giving a bit of a sass.

30:31.684 --> 30:32.064
Yeah.

30:32.804 --> 30:36.866
BAU BAU is like a bit more awkward.

30:37.266 --> 30:38.226
I take that back.

30:38.766 --> 30:40.467
You can go, I'm not.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.208
Yeah, it's like, oh I feel...

30:43.820 --> 30:44.500
I feel funny.

30:44.900 --> 30:45.160
Yeah.

30:45.401 --> 30:46.421
That kind of BAU BAU.

30:46.781 --> 30:51.883
Again, this one's kind of hard for humans to understand that well too, so... You wouldn't get it that easily.

30:51.983 --> 30:52.343
Yeah.

30:52.623 --> 30:53.443
So BAU BAU!

30:53.943 --> 30:56.164
And BAU BAU... BAU BAU is probably the easiest.

30:56.204 --> 30:56.504
Yeah.

30:56.964 --> 30:57.244
Yeah.

30:57.885 --> 30:58.205
Got it!

30:58.225 --> 30:58.685
Understood!

30:58.705 --> 31:01.906
Does that make sense, Ruffians?

31:02.606 --> 31:06.587
You understand the differences in why we only go BAU BAU!

31:06.647 --> 31:07.388
BAU BAU!

31:07.448 --> 31:08.468
BAU BAU, right?

31:08.968 --> 31:09.528
Makes sense.

31:09.708 --> 31:10.569
Right, right.

31:12.293 --> 31:13.853
I'm happy that it makes sense.

31:13.953 --> 31:15.274
I feel like we got closer.

31:15.314 --> 31:19.635
Who was that?

31:20.595 --> 31:21.715
BAU BAU!

31:22.535 --> 31:26.096
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for your submissions, you know?

31:26.336 --> 31:30.737
FUWAMOCO Midnight is something that, you know, we make together.

31:30.777 --> 31:32.077
Just like FUWAMOCO Morning.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.798
Just this once a year.

31:35.558 --> 31:40.999
Even if midnight maybe becomes morning, we're still always looking for more doggy of the

31:41.719 --> 31:44.320
Cute girlfriend after party!

31:44.380 --> 31:45.421
We're having our

32:09.771 --> 32:17.135
Afterparty for cute no kanojo, so we hope that after you come to the premiere, which you'll definitely be at, right?

32:17.275 --> 32:17.715
Right!

32:17.835 --> 32:22.958
Pretty much right after that ends, we'll be having an afterparty for it.

32:23.258 --> 32:34.784
And you know we're gonna talk about, you know, just what it means to us, and, uh, you know, what our feelings were when we were recording it and everything, so we hope that you'll be there.

32:34.844 --> 32:37.045
Maybe that you can let us know your thoughts, too!

32:40.754 --> 32:41.615
Well, Ruffians.

32:41.955 --> 32:42.856
You'll be there, right?

32:42.896 --> 32:44.677
I'll be there!

32:46.098 --> 32:46.879
You'll be there!

32:49.501 --> 32:50.101
Definitely!

32:50.221 --> 32:50.922
Definitely!

32:50.962 --> 32:52.003
Can't wait for it!

32:54.865 --> 32:57.687
We'll be waiting.

32:57.707 --> 33:01.049
Come on!

33:04.632 --> 33:05.052
Okay!

33:05.172 --> 33:06.053
Next, our schedule!

33:06.133 --> 33:07.134
Our schedule.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.395
We have to continue thinking.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.437
We have!

33:11.718 --> 33:16.020
Well, today is a busy day, but tomorrow is Halloween.

33:16.560 --> 33:21.742
And, you know, we have a lot of fun that we're going to be having together.

33:22.683 --> 33:36.550
First, we're going to be playing a spooky Halloween TTRPG for the first time ever, together with Calli-senpai as the Game Master, as well as Ina-senpai, and Bae-senpai, Kronii-senpai too.

33:38.035 --> 33:40.656
We're looking forward to it but kind of nervous too.

33:40.716 --> 33:42.416
It's our first TT RPG ever.

33:42.456 --> 33:43.936
Yeah, extra spooky.

33:44.056 --> 33:49.437
And after that we're having a big Halloween costume party together with all of our friends.

33:49.517 --> 33:50.538
But it doesn't end there.

33:50.978 --> 33:52.098
It doesn't, it doesn't.

33:52.518 --> 33:59.819
Finally we'll be ending off the Halloween fun with a spooky story time where we'll be reading out your scary stories, Ruffians.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.080
BAU BAU!

34:01.400 --> 34:02.080
Are you ready?

34:02.460 --> 34:03.300
Are you ready for it?

34:04.340 --> 34:04.780
BAU BAU!

34:08.845 --> 34:11.286
This week, my baby!

34:11.306 --> 34:14.607
So ready!

34:14.627 --> 34:15.707
So ready!

34:15.727 --> 34:17.168
We're ready too.

34:18.088 --> 34:18.628
Are we?

34:20.749 --> 34:22.449
I'm ready.

34:22.469 --> 34:25.650
I don't know Moco-chan is.

34:25.690 --> 34:34.452
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us today for our spooky FUWAMOCO Midnight!

34:35.072 --> 34:36.413
Did we scare you?

34:40.289 --> 34:58.117
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra spooky Ruffians today!

34:59.098 --> 35:00.739
Extra spooky Ruffians!

35:06.682 --> 35:07.567
Stay tuned!

35:07.888 --> 35:09.316

35:29.967 --> 35:35.689
And to every other Ruffian out there, we hope you have a howl, howl, howloween!

35:35.769 --> 35:37.709
Howl, howl, howloween!

35:37.849 --> 35:38.209
Have a day.

35:38.569 --> 35:39.150
Have a day.

35:39.230 --> 35:39.510
And night.

35:41.107 --> 35:42.889
This was FUWAMOCO Midnight!
