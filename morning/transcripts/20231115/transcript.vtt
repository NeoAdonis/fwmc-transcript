00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.131
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:58.059
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.622
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimayo!

00:04:59.963 --> 00:05:00.384
BAU BAU!

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.733
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:10.534
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:13.216
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.816
BAU BAU!

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:19.779
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.679
Just for today.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.301
Just for today.

00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:24.341
Ruffians!

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.903
Today's our 44th episode!

00:05:27.963 --> 00:05:29.524
BAU BAU!

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:31.985
Thank you for joining us today!

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:33.446
Thank you!

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:35.399
It's Wednesday.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.221
That means you've made it halfway through the week.

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:51.968
I don't know if I saw any Ruffians that are joining us for the first time, but... I think there's still some Ruffians that maybe aren't too sure.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.003
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, Monday.

00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:00.864
A.K.A.

00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:01.864
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:05.326
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:11.690
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.173
Ruffians, you know what you're supposed to do here now, right?

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:19.115
Do you know what you're supposed to do?

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:22.499
I'll tell you.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:23.179
Okay.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.620
You don't have to remember, because I've got you.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.260
Yeah.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.321
You need to tweet your thoughts with the hashtag.

00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.162
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:38.244
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:41.805
BAU BAU!

00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:46.326
Well, like always, the Ruffians, Ruffians, Ruffians.

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:49.387
You might have seen Pero around, right?

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:52.849
Was there a Pero Sighting?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.370
De-den!

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:07.332
Ruffians... Now we're getting a bit worried.

00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:15.854
It's almost been a week now since anyone's seen Pero.

00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:20.275
It's okay, right?

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:24.418
Is he really missing now?

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.199
I'm worried.

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:29.220
Maybe he's just gone on a really good vacation.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.482
Hopefully.

00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:35.762
Ruffians!

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.623
Please let us know as soon as you can if you see Pero.

00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:47.266
I mean... Pero's pretty nasty, but... It would be bad if something happened, right Moco-chan?

00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:48.166
It wouldn't be good.

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:49.966
No.

00:07:50.087 --> 00:07:51.367
Very important, yes.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:53.559
Please let us know.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.061
Looking for Pero.

00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:57.822
Looking for Pero.

00:07:58.042 --> 00:07:58.962
BAU BAU!

00:07:59.562 --> 00:07:59.923
But!

00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:03.104
Happy Endings!

00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:04.805
Ruffians.

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:05.645
You watched one!

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:15.943
Just a few days ago, it was Marisenjo-senpai's 4th anniversary!

00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:16.924
The concert.

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:18.386
The concert, right?

00:08:18.486 --> 00:08:26.013
And she held a Showa Kaio side this year, getting a bunch of amazing hits from yesteryears.

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:26.934
Even more!

00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:28.496
Even more different ones from

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.818
Why'd you say that I wasn't happy?

00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:31.199
I was happy too!

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:31.319
Yes!

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.582
But, to tell the truth, we haven't been able to watch the concert yet.

00:08:54.722 --> 00:08:58.023
Because we want to be able to take a moment to properly enjoy it, you know?

00:08:58.984 --> 00:08:59.984
Like a yummy dessert.

00:09:00.004 --> 00:09:03.605
You want to be able to enjoy it properly and savor it.

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:08.867
Yeah, you know, as you know, Ruffians, it's been a little bit busy recently.

00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:09.948
So, but...

00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:16.032
I'm sure Ruffians, you are aware, but I really like Japanese oldies.

00:09:16.392 --> 00:09:20.018
So, you know, this kind of thing feels like it was made exactly for us.

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:20.359
Right!

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:21.260
Exactly!

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.642
It definitely wasn't, though.

00:09:22.943 --> 00:09:23.744
Definitely wasn't.

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:24.265
It wasn't for us.

00:09:24.807 --> 00:09:26.128
It was, though.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.131
We can't be happier!

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:36.275
You know, especially because I really like my Senju-senpai, too.

00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:44.320
We'll work hard as members of hololive so that maybe one day Senju-senpai might be interested in calling on us, too.

00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:46.162
Maybe one day!

00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:48.403
We'll have to work really hard!

00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:50.064
BAU BAU!

00:09:52.686 --> 00:10:00.952
Continuing on that, something else also happened to FUWAMOCO-chan.

00:10:01.492 --> 00:10:06.756
Senchuu-senpai also unveiled a new original song!

00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:10.718
Together with Gura-senpai called Shinkirou!

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:17.683
Of course, it's a wonderfully nostalgic song overflowing with silly pop vibes.

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:22.266
The music video that Senchuu-senpai had made for it is so beautiful.

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:28.187
We haven't had a look at it yet.

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:30.448
You should check it out!

00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:30.708
Got it!

00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:54.563
BAU BAU!

00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:58.707
And on other news you should keep your eye on.

00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:00.969
This is important.

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:02.071
Very important.

00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:03.292
Listen up.

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:09.658
So, you might be surprised, but Ruffians!

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:13.378
There's only one week!

00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:14.198
One week.

00:11:14.378 --> 00:11:15.219
Not even one week.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:22.244
Until Abyss Demolish Diva Nobita Mimikawa's birthday!

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:23.344
Yay!

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:25.906
Her first birthday as a member of hololive!

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:27.867
I'm so excited!

00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:28.588
Yeah!

00:11:28.848 --> 00:11:29.628
Did you know?

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:32.310
Well, it's okay if you didn't know because we brought you.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.031
Now you know.

00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:33.611
Now you know.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.492
It's a week before.

00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:35.312
You have time.

00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:35.772
Yeah.

00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:46.280
But actually, Ruffians, we realized we still haven't decided on a present for her.

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:50.264
Do you have any ideas?

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:52.405
Ideas, please.

00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:53.246
Ruffians!

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:55.167
Ideas, please!

00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.250
We can't really sing her a song because that's kind of her thing, right?

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.271
She could sing herself a song.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.653
Maybe something that will make her smile?

00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:08.229
Wait, did I see somebody say a whip?

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:09.471
What?

00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:09.591
Ha?

00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:10.833
Ha?

00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:11.593
Oh, soup!

00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:12.875
Soup.

00:12:13.396 --> 00:12:14.377
Fuwawa soup.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:16.620
No?

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:19.289
She didn't like my gnome.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.371
I don't know, but maybe she just doesn't know the, you know... She didn't want to know my gnome!

00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:27.812
The good positive sides of gnomes, you know?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:28.973
She didn't want to know.

00:12:28.993 --> 00:12:29.693
The miryoku.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.834
She didn't want to know my gnome, okay?

00:12:32.514 --> 00:12:33.894
A big paw in the ring.

00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:36.435
Wacking tea, that's true.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:37.395
Sort of like soup.

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:46.305
I feel like that's more like something Shiori would give her.

00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:49.049
It was very very close to her.

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:50.050
Underneath her shirt.

00:13:00.103 --> 00:13:03.906
Moco-chan's tummy!

00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:06.388
That's the best suggestion so far.

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:09.571
You should know that my tummy is mine.

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:11.953
It's mine.

00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:13.734
Are you sure, Moco-chan?

00:13:13.754 --> 00:13:14.314
Mine only, okay?

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:16.376
Your tummy doesn't belong to me, Chiyo.

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:18.658
You know we are twins, right?

00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:21.400
So that means you can have my tummy too, Moco-chan.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.501
No, I don't need yours.

00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:23.862
I have mine, thank you.

00:13:24.883 --> 00:13:26.844
Chiyo, I don't need another tummy either.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.782
We have some really good ideas for the Ruffians.

00:13:30.802 --> 00:13:33.043
Some.

00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:33.883
Not all of them.

00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:34.464
Just some.

00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:36.385
But Ruffians, please don't let her know.

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:38.386
Don't let her know our plans.

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:40.087
It's a secret, okay?

00:13:40.707 --> 00:13:46.091
We hope that you'll celebrate it with her and the rest of Abyss all together on November 21st.

00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:49.533
It's a happy time.

00:13:50.313 --> 00:13:51.634
Mark your calendars, okay?

00:13:52.094 --> 00:13:52.494
BAU BAU!

00:13:57.007 --> 00:13:58.407
So happy!

00:13:58.807 --> 00:13:59.788
November 21st.

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:01.488
November 21st.

00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:02.829
November 21st.

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:04.389
The 21st.

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:06.710
The 21st is Nerissa's birthday.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.891
But that's the end of the happy news for today.

00:14:18.674 --> 00:14:19.414
Ruffians.

00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:23.736
I feel like it's been a bit of a while, but

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.420
It happened again.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.301
I missed understanding.

00:14:33.682 --> 00:14:34.582
I messed up.

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:36.142
Fuwawa messed up.

00:14:37.442 --> 00:14:40.443
You know, we thought we corrected things right on the spot.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:43.763
But, maybe it wasn't clear enough for you.

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:53.385
You know, when we were playing Fashion Dreamer on Monday, and trying to choose what kind of eyes for our muse to have, Fuwawa

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:59.760
She fumbled her words and she said something suspicious.

00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:10.545
About, you know, massaging things and getting bigger.

00:15:10.725 --> 00:15:12.926
Yeah, not good.

00:15:13.506 --> 00:15:16.808
But, like she explained, it was about

00:15:17.927 --> 00:15:19.369
You know, eye massage.

00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:20.810
Face massage.

00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:24.074
So that your eyes will look bigger, okay?

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:25.816
And you know, it did!

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.679
It did make Moco-chan's eyes bigger.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:29.119
Yes!

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:30.921
But it's very dangerous.

00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:35.406
But you know, massages can make things smaller too!

00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:35.846
It can!

00:15:35.926 --> 00:15:37.829
That's what we wanted to say!

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:39.931
You know, we've done massages for

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:43.554
Your legs and your face look like they're slimmer and brighter too.

00:15:43.574 --> 00:15:45.876
There's a lot of power to massage, okay?

00:15:45.936 --> 00:15:46.937
Right, right.

00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:48.158
Very powerful.

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:53.602
So we want you to understand and know that it works both ways, okay?

00:15:54.183 --> 00:15:55.444
Small too.

00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:57.265
Don't misunderstand about massages.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:08.175
But you know... I don't know if this is a bit selfish of me,

00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:19.044
But... Someday... You know... I'd like to actually go get an actual massage!

00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:19.905
You know... No.

00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:19.965
No.

00:16:19.985 --> 00:16:20.365
An actual massage!

00:16:20.385 --> 00:16:21.245
Or... Even just a scalp massage!

00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:21.786
I feel like...

00:16:32.947 --> 00:16:38.871
You know, peak luxury is going to the hairstylist and just getting a scalp massage for 30 minutes.

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.612
I like to do that one day.

00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:42.893
The fuzz will get even fuzzier.

00:16:42.993 --> 00:16:45.034
I feel like my brain will end up like mush.

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:48.076
It might be good for a change, huh?

00:16:48.196 --> 00:16:49.097
A mushy brain?

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:49.857
Mushy brain.

00:16:50.338 --> 00:16:51.919
Not fuzzy, not fluffy.

00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:53.160
A bit mushy.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:53.720
Yeah.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.482
Oi!

00:16:56.942 --> 00:16:58.363
You do it to Ruffians!

00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:00.631
That's not fair.

00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:02.452
A scalp massage from the Ruffians?

00:17:02.652 --> 00:17:03.473
No, no.

00:17:04.053 --> 00:17:04.753
Professional.

00:17:06.254 --> 00:17:10.717
Ruffians aren't professional.

00:17:11.017 --> 00:17:12.738
You understand now, Ruffians?

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.479
Yeah, no misunderstanding.

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:17.000
BAU BAU!

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.841
It's good, it's good, it's good.

00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:19.561
So, I...

00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:29.478
My stuff happened in Fashion Dreamer.

00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:31.079
Not a misunderstanding again.

00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:34.260
Not a misunderstanding, but a problem.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.761
P-problem.

00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:45.804
So, you might have noticed, Ruffians, but during Fashion Dreamer, Fuwawa had a bit of a strange habit.

00:17:45.824 --> 00:17:53.007
She kept on touching the monitor multiple, multiple times repeatedly.

00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:57.335
And you know, you Ruffians, you thought it was sorta cute.

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.957
You thought it was good fun, all that.

00:18:01.318 --> 00:18:05.861
But really, the reality is that it was not cute.

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:10.024
Each time, it was very terrifying.

00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:20.032
Cuz you know, each touch, it wasn't really as much of a touch as it was a very strong push with your finger.

00:18:22.256 --> 00:18:27.298
As if... Almost trying to push right through the monitor.

00:18:27.318 --> 00:18:29.959
I just... You know what?

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:33.680
I just got a bit passionate.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.582
You know, maybe I'm not so great judging the distance to the monitor, Ruffians.

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:42.623
It's not just the issue of smudges, you know?

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:47.885
I'm worried that she'll actually break the monitor with the force of her poke or just push it right off the desk.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.886
You wouldn't like it too if that happened, right Ruffians?

00:18:54.828 --> 00:18:55.168
Right.

00:18:56.609 --> 00:19:00.511
Dead pixels can happen, that's not the problem!

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:02.091
It's everything!

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:11.016
So maybe... Maybe we can play Flash and Dreamer again if Lala learns to control her habit.

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:15.778
But... But how many times she's guilty of touching the monitor the other day?

00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.022
I honestly don't know.

00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:23.544
Sorry, Ruffians.

00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:25.365
What about me?

00:19:28.008 --> 00:19:28.388
I don't know.

00:19:28.428 --> 00:19:30.570
This is something you decided, Moco-chan.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.733
Stop touching the monitor.

00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:35.854
Okay.

00:19:36.094 --> 00:19:36.715
I can't.

00:19:37.435 --> 00:19:37.916
I must.

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:41.879
I need to know exactly what dress I want to wear.

00:19:49.648 --> 00:19:53.091
BAU BAU!

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.333
Is that the end of the sad news?

00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:59.497
There was actually an incident.

00:20:00.338 --> 00:20:01.779
An incident yesterday.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:04.142
You know, maybe...

00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:19.228
Some Ruffians didn't hear about the incident, but... Yesterday... Yesterday was the day that we started playing Metal Gear Solid for the very first time!

00:20:19.308 --> 00:20:29.532
And because it's a special first, we wanted to play it as it was first released, and we bought a PS1 copy to play it as it was first, you know, first released!

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:32.213
Yeah, you know, it was great to go and everything!

00:20:32.233 --> 00:20:32.993
Yeah, but...

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:40.462
We didn't realize that we kinda made a fatal error.

00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:42.023
Do you know what it was?

00:20:42.043 --> 00:20:45.106
Yeah.

00:20:45.486 --> 00:20:51.852
That you can't save PS1 data onto a PS2 memory card.

00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:54.134
Fuwawa made a mistake.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:57.257
I asked.

00:20:58.098 --> 00:20:59.319
She thought it was right.

00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:01.891
But!

00:21:02.431 --> 00:21:02.751
But!

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:12.897
We thought that, you know, we might have had a solution and Papa Puppy was able to get us a used PS1 memory card really fast in no time at all!

00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:16.218
But the PS2 wouldn't recognize it.

00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:19.280
The game would recognize it, but the PS2 wouldn't.

00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:30.454
So, the saga continues because Mama Puppy is now going to join in on the mission and help us acquire even more Memory Cards!

00:21:30.474 --> 00:21:33.476
More Memory Cards!

00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:36.277
Wish us luck, Ruffians, okay?

00:21:36.758 --> 00:21:43.021
And, you know, if that doesn't work, we might be adding a PS1 to the console family.

00:21:45.043 --> 00:21:47.484
BAU BAU!

00:21:47.524 --> 00:21:49.125
We'll keep you updated, okay?

00:21:49.165 --> 00:21:49.485
A PS1?

00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:50.766
I've never had a PS1.

00:21:50.786 --> 00:21:53.147
They're round, right?

00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:54.688
That's kinda cool.

00:21:54.908 --> 00:21:55.508
No, they're round.

00:21:55.528 --> 00:21:57.809
The top is round, but it's not round itself.

00:21:58.209 --> 00:21:58.649
Why not?

00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:00.891
I want it to be round.

00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:02.531
Can we ask them to make it round now?

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:04.332
Maybe the next one.

00:22:04.352 --> 00:22:04.972
Maybe the PS6?

00:22:05.153 --> 00:22:08.514
I was gonna say maybe the PS5.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:29.313
I thought maybe it might be well needed for some Ruffians today, so... Good morning!

00:22:31.113 --> 00:22:32.633
Good morning!

00:22:38.074 --> 00:22:40.355
I don't see your eyelids open all the way there.

00:22:43.632 --> 00:22:44.653
Are you awake yet?

00:22:47.394 --> 00:22:49.015
Okay, well, it's okay this once, okay?

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:51.756
You can keep your eyelids closed if you want.

00:22:53.137 --> 00:23:01.901
In case you can't tell with your eyes closed like that though, this is another Mococo Pup Talk, coming straight from me, Mococo!

00:23:03.262 --> 00:23:08.164
You've been working hard, so it's okay to give yourself a little bit more time to rest in the morning, okay?

00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:11.906
But, if you want to know a secret,

00:23:13.283 --> 00:23:19.365
If you go to sleep even a little bit earlier than your usual sleep time, your body will thank you in the morning!

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:21.365
It's a secret though.

00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:24.586
You know what will also thank you?

00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:26.567
Me!

00:23:26.767 --> 00:23:27.827
Mococo!

00:23:28.108 --> 00:23:28.728
I'll thank you.

00:23:30.256 --> 00:23:35.059
You can get even more time to sleep in the morning, you know, by adding just a bit more time on the other way.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.861
But for now, don't worry.

00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:39.882
You can rest just a bit more.

00:23:40.543 --> 00:23:45.586
You've got a busy rest of the week ahead of you, so make sure not to be too harsh on yourself, okay?

00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:47.407
You're doing your best.

00:23:48.107 --> 00:23:49.428
And that's all you can do!

00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:55.112
You know, even if no one else sees it, you know it's true.

00:23:55.612 --> 00:23:56.933
And that's what's the most important.

00:23:58.054 --> 00:23:59.535
I know you're doing awesome!

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:02.595
Be your own story's main character!

00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:04.096
You're in control!

00:24:04.557 --> 00:24:05.317
You can do it!

00:24:05.698 --> 00:24:06.799
I believe in you!

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:09.421
Ganbatte de!

00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.583
BAU BAU!

00:24:13.124 --> 00:24:15.126
BAU BAU!

00:24:16.067 --> 00:24:17.948
Thank you for the pup talk, Moco-chan.

00:24:17.988 --> 00:24:18.609
You're welcome.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.030
You're welcome!

00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:24.054
Ruffians, do you feel a little bit more awake now?

00:24:24.414 --> 00:24:24.734
It's okay.

00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:28.708
This time it's okay.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.571
Just this... Just this time, okay.

00:24:34.691 --> 00:24:35.652
Yeah.

00:24:36.432 --> 00:24:36.912
Well!

00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:38.473
Doggie of the Day!

00:24:39.574 --> 00:24:43.896
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:24:46.537 --> 00:24:46.817
Ice!

00:24:47.718 --> 00:24:48.418
It's ice!

00:24:49.238 --> 00:24:50.019
Cute!

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:52.280
Cute!

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.781
Is this the cutest Doggie of the Day?

00:24:54.821 --> 00:24:55.842
Doggies of the day.

00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:02.275
Look at what happens when you go on a walk, right Ruffians?

00:25:03.342 --> 00:25:05.023
Good things happen!

00:25:05.664 --> 00:25:07.665
You could... BAU BIG TIME!

00:25:08.065 --> 00:25:09.466
Just like that!

00:25:09.766 --> 00:25:10.687
Look at that!

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:13.549
The blue one is even a bit bigger too!

00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:14.670
But we're the same height.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.791
So cute!

00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:22.635
But, you know... No laces can keep me contained, Ruffians, so... Yeah.

00:25:23.115 --> 00:25:26.357
Even though they look similar, maybe... It's not us.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:27.518
That's not us.

00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:28.779
They're just dogs, okay?

00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:30.720
Not Demon Guard Dogs.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.501
Not Demon Guard Dogs.

00:25:33.502 --> 00:25:34.243
Similis.

00:25:35.023 --> 00:25:35.444
Different.

00:25:38.005 --> 00:25:39.406
How did they BAU BAU?

00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:55.237
If you know if they're anything like us, then... BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU B

00:26:00.163 --> 00:26:09.110
Well, you know, just like the twin Demon Guard Dogs, FUWAMOCO, I think they're rather well-behaved.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:13.333
They love to have fun and go for walks too.

00:26:13.393 --> 00:26:20.838
You know, maybe they're even protecting the smiles of the lady who's taking them for a walk there.

00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:24.741
Have fun on your walk now, FUWAMOCO!

00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:26.242
BAU BAU!

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:38.505
Ruffians have been going on walks because we saw the FNOWFUWAMOCO debunked too, but what other walks have Ruffians been going on?

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:40.346
It was... De-den!

00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:43.547
Mushrooms!

00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:45.148
Science Experiment.

00:26:45.588 --> 00:26:47.869
That's an awesome mushroom right there.

00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:50.270
It looks like some inches right out of Mario, right?

00:26:51.011 --> 00:26:53.312
I like the small one on the side too.

00:26:53.352 --> 00:26:54.072
Very well, I.

00:26:55.879 --> 00:26:56.419
Hydrated.

00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:01.261
He's not as glamorous, but he's hydrated.

00:27:01.361 --> 00:27:03.382
He's doing his best.

00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:11.445
Actually, Ruffians, Moco-chan and I, we really like watching time-lapse videos of mushrooms growing.

00:27:11.925 --> 00:27:15.106
We try growing mushrooms ourselves too, even.

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:18.558
That really healed me.

00:27:19.298 --> 00:27:22.880
Ruffians, definitely don't eat any mushrooms you find on the walk, ever.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.001
Unless you know!

00:27:24.741 --> 00:27:27.483
But you should maybe ask a professional.

00:27:27.603 --> 00:27:31.245
Even if you think you know, you don't know, so never... Yeah, ask a professional, okay?

00:27:31.965 --> 00:27:34.147
Okay, never ever eat any mushrooms on the sidewalk.

00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:35.327
Unless you're with a professional.

00:27:36.128 --> 00:27:37.148
And that's not Moco-chan.

00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:39.575
Got it.

00:27:39.595 --> 00:27:43.137
BAU BAU!

00:27:43.337 --> 00:27:44.537
I kinda wanna touch that one.

00:27:44.817 --> 00:27:45.398
Don't touch them.

00:27:45.758 --> 00:27:46.438
Don't touch.

00:27:46.678 --> 00:27:47.639
Don't put them in your mouth.

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:48.639
Leave them be.

00:27:48.699 --> 00:27:49.039
Just look.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.020
Just look.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:50.880
Photo.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.681
Yeah.

00:27:53.921 --> 00:27:56.102
Ruffians, do you have any questions for us?

00:27:57.683 --> 00:28:00.704
We do have a Question of the Day!

00:28:00.784 --> 00:28:03.044
It is... De-den!

00:28:03.624 --> 00:28:05.685
Hi ladies, I have a question.

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:13.527
I know you're both Demon Dogs, but upon careful inspection, it looks like you both have human ears as well as your dog's ears.

00:28:14.087 --> 00:28:16.528
So I'm wondering which ears you use.

00:28:17.848 --> 00:28:21.149
We have four ears.

00:28:23.643 --> 00:28:24.403
It's kinda crazy.

00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:27.725
But you know... Not really.

00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:29.426
It's not really like that.

00:28:29.466 --> 00:28:32.467
Because our human ears are just decoration.

00:28:32.487 --> 00:28:33.688
They're just decoration.

00:28:33.908 --> 00:28:38.030
You know, it's so that we don't scare humans and don't stand out even more than we already do.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.772
All the hearing is done by our Demon Dog ears, okay?

00:28:43.532 --> 00:28:44.793
And they do a pretty good job.

00:28:45.113 --> 00:28:51.156
Right, but sometimes they do get a bit tired after playing games for a long time.

00:28:51.556 --> 00:28:57.739
You know, especially since headphones aren't really made for a kind of fluffy and fuzzy ears too.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:59.099
The majority of headphones.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.281
My headphones are a bit different, but you know.

00:29:02.361 --> 00:29:03.461
But, oh well.

00:29:03.861 --> 00:29:05.062
BAU BAU!

00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:17.404
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions and for making FUWAMOCO Morning the kind of show it is all together with us.

00:29:18.004 --> 00:29:19.705
BAU BAU!

00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:23.206
Please remember we're always looking for more submissions, so...

00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:25.815
Forget the hashtag.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:29.296
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:30.437
BAU BAU!

00:29:30.617 --> 00:29:39.480
And for our next stream... It's a bit different because this time we're taking off some time for our homework.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.282
Yeah, we're gonna be taking some time to do homework so there won't be a stream tonight or tomorrow.

00:29:46.602 --> 00:29:47.422
It's a bit scary.

00:29:47.522 --> 00:29:49.443
Yeah, it's going to be...

00:29:50.063 --> 00:29:57.555
Ruff for all of us, but we'll do our best to get as much homework as we can get done as fast as we can, Ruffians.

00:29:57.656 --> 00:30:00.320
To be honest, it's a bit more difficult.

00:30:01.192 --> 00:30:04.173
We'll be back on Friday for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:30:04.693 --> 00:30:11.114
After that, we're going to be having a watch-along of our pick, our movie pick, Space Adventure Cobra.

00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.781
So we hope you'll be there, Ruffians.

00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:33.661
BAU BAU!

00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:36.644
Let's take a quick peek at the schedule once more.

00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:37.064
Ah, yes.

00:30:38.385 --> 00:30:41.848
We have... This weekend!

00:30:41.868 --> 00:30:44.851
This weekend is Anime NYC!

00:30:45.572 --> 00:30:49.335
At FUWAMOCO, we're going to be there together with Advent!

00:30:49.855 --> 00:30:51.697
Our first convention appearance.

00:30:52.638 --> 00:30:54.519
But, you know, Ruffians...

00:30:56.204 --> 00:31:07.827
I think, you know, if you're a little bit further from New York City than you were before, then we'd like to suggest, very strongly suggest, that you make a VR chat!

00:31:08.107 --> 00:31:08.647
Yeah!

00:31:08.727 --> 00:31:09.267
It's free!

00:31:09.487 --> 00:31:18.090
And you know, that way you can attend our Walk and War Mini, Walk and War Party Mini, and our Q&A time, virtually!

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:18.810
Exactly.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:25.757
So, you know, even if you don't have paws on the ground in New York then, you can still attend!

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:27.439
This way you can still see us.

00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:29.621
We hope that you'll be there, Ruffians!

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:32.284
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.444 --> 00:31:35.367
We'll still be here on Saturday and Sunday like always.

00:31:35.507 --> 00:31:37.589
And we'll be reading Super Chats from this week!

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.764
We'll be the Super Chats for the Rock n' Rawr Party.

00:31:46.184 --> 00:31:47.625
So don't wait!

00:31:47.845 --> 00:31:48.406
BAU BAU!

00:31:48.426 --> 00:31:50.567
We'll get to them, don't worry.

00:31:50.647 --> 00:31:52.228
We're looking forward to it.

00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:53.289
BAU BAU!

00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:59.314
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your support.

00:31:59.694 --> 00:32:02.735
Thank you for waking us up.

00:32:02.775 --> 00:32:06.236
Thank you for waking us up, Ruffians!

00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:08.537
Thank you for waking us up!

00:32:10.077 --> 00:32:16.599
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!
