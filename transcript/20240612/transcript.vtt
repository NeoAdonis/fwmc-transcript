05:06.806 --> 05:09.150
Hello, hello, BAU BAU!

05:10.372 --> 05:13.937
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:13.957 --> 05:18.164
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

05:18.244 --> 05:18.504
BAU!

05:21.624 --> 05:24.585
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:24.965 --> 05:27.285
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:27.506 --> 05:30.326
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.387 --> 05:32.467
BAU BAU!

05:33.027 --> 05:36.829
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:37.329 --> 05:42.070
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 98th

05:44.676 --> 05:48.578
It's not a 98 episode, no?

05:48.638 --> 05:48.758
Huh?

05:48.778 --> 05:51.419
What do you mean?

05:51.479 --> 05:54.961
It's... Ruffians, it's a 98 episode.

05:54.981 --> 05:55.021
No!

05:56.121 --> 05:57.682
That's scary.

05:57.702 --> 05:58.623
98, yo!

05:58.723 --> 06:01.124
Yes, you know what the Ruffians are saying.

06:02.503 --> 06:03.044
98 yo!

06:03.164 --> 06:04.165
I'm not think about it.

06:04.825 --> 06:06.026
BAU BAU!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.407
BAU BAU!

06:07.507 --> 06:09.728
Thank you, Ruffians!

06:10.249 --> 06:11.209
Wow, not 98!

06:11.249 --> 06:15.312
See now, Moco-chan, you confuse Ruffians too!

06:17.284 --> 06:23.729
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:23.809 --> 06:24.530
AKA FUWAMOCO!

06:24.550 --> 06:25.951
And it's a show hosted by us!

06:43.764 --> 06:45.105
FUWAMOCO!

06:45.125 --> 06:51.308
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:51.868 --> 06:58.052
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag, hashtag, FWMCMORNING!

06:58.432 --> 07:02.454
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

07:02.474 --> 07:03.234
BAU BAU!

07:07.617 --> 07:09.078
Have you had breakfast yet?

07:09.198 --> 07:09.658
What?

07:10.018 --> 07:10.839
Ruffians.

07:11.479 --> 07:12.240
Breakfast?

07:12.300 --> 07:14.221
Not just like, oh I had a coffee.

07:14.521 --> 07:14.881
No.

07:14.901 --> 07:15.882
Did you have bread?

07:16.342 --> 07:16.703
Rice?

07:16.923 --> 07:18.023
Coffee doesn't count.

07:18.083 --> 07:18.163
Eggs?

07:19.304 --> 07:19.865
Toast?

07:20.985 --> 07:21.446
FUWAMOCO!

07:21.566 --> 07:22.206
You did!

07:23.247 --> 07:24.007
Not yet?

07:24.187 --> 07:25.248
Oh sure, yes.

07:25.748 --> 07:26.949
Breakfast is good.

07:26.969 --> 07:28.030
A midnight snack?

07:29.779 --> 07:30.559
Not pizza.

07:30.719 --> 07:32.640
Ban gohan tabita yokatta.

07:33.260 --> 07:33.800
Toast.

07:34.120 --> 07:34.740
Just coffee!

07:34.800 --> 07:36.881
Have something more!

07:37.381 --> 07:37.621
Okay!

07:37.641 --> 07:38.782
I want salt.

07:38.962 --> 07:39.522
Bite eye.

07:39.582 --> 07:40.882
Salt sounds good.

07:41.902 --> 07:46.044
There's been another... Another sighting.

07:46.964 --> 07:49.985
I thought that you said there was breakfast prepared.

07:50.025 --> 07:51.285
Not another breakfast!

07:52.045 --> 07:52.345
No.

07:53.085 --> 07:54.166
Not another breakfast.

07:55.046 --> 07:56.326
Another peron sighting.

07:57.567 --> 07:58.447
But there'll be breakfast after.

08:02.878 --> 08:03.419
Let's see.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.820
Where was Pero sighted then?

08:06.941 --> 08:07.702
De-den!

08:09.343 --> 08:10.444
Oh!

08:10.684 --> 08:12.745
I don't think there's any breakfast here.

08:15.587 --> 08:18.549
Is this where Pero's been hiding this whole time?

08:18.569 --> 08:20.911
Get it!

08:21.231 --> 08:22.252
Whole time!

08:22.932 --> 08:23.573
Because he's in a...

08:29.779 --> 08:33.080
Maybe this is his new doggy house, Ruffian!

08:33.140 --> 08:33.740
Yeah!

08:33.760 --> 08:38.541
You know, I can very thankfully say our dog house is much nicer than this, though.

08:38.981 --> 08:39.121
Yeah.

08:39.161 --> 08:40.061
Maybe just a bit.

08:40.081 --> 08:40.521
Yeah.

08:41.041 --> 08:49.883
Yeah, I think that maybe the rest of Advent wouldn't want to have a sleepover with us if, you know, our place kind of looked a little bit like this.

08:49.923 --> 08:52.863
You know, we still don't really have much furniture or dishes.

08:52.903 --> 08:53.724
It's very similar.

08:54.204 --> 08:56.024
But it's not quite like this.

08:57.722 --> 08:58.682
Although you know what?

08:59.163 --> 09:04.366
I do think that maybe Biboo could probably sleep on that hole too.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.348
Yeah, she does like sort of cramped spaces.

09:07.368 --> 09:10.831
The hole does look pretty comfy.

09:11.331 --> 09:17.075
Ruffians, do you think we should get maybe some housewarming gifts for Pero?

09:17.115 --> 09:18.056
You like the pink wall.

09:21.158 --> 09:22.399
The one nice thing?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.683
This potato is not nice!

09:25.763 --> 09:27.965
Does he deserve some housewarming gifts?

09:28.065 --> 09:28.205
Nah.

09:28.806 --> 09:29.346
Nah.

09:29.366 --> 09:30.728
He doesn't need them.

09:30.748 --> 09:33.330
Yeah, he has some clothes.

09:33.350 --> 09:34.151
Some clothes.

09:34.632 --> 09:35.332
Does he have a hoe?

09:35.372 --> 09:36.634
I think he has a hoe.

09:37.782 --> 09:38.042
BAU BAU!

09:57.352 --> 09:59.194
We wouldn't want too much dreams, huh?

09:59.274 --> 09:59.654
Yeah.

10:00.074 --> 10:01.135
Some windows!

10:02.176 --> 10:04.378
Ruffians, you can be in charge of that.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.079
I don't want to get any splinters.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.220
Yeah.

10:07.901 --> 10:08.321
Yeah.

10:08.561 --> 10:20.051
Well, you can't see it, but there was some traffic columns in there too, so hopefully they can get rid of those so that maybe it's not too drafty in there too.

10:20.351 --> 10:20.632
Yeah.

10:20.972 --> 10:22.974
Traffic columns don't make a good pillow.

10:23.014 --> 10:24.755
I don't think there's any cars coming by.

10:26.056 --> 10:27.697
BAU BAU!

10:34.574 --> 10:37.756
BAU BAU!

10:38.077 --> 10:41.820
I guess the good thing about not having any windows is you don't need any curtains, right?

10:42.100 --> 10:42.540
True.

10:43.281 --> 10:44.241
Made it easy.

10:44.422 --> 10:45.903
Bright side to everything.

10:46.363 --> 10:48.785
BAU BAU!

10:49.045 --> 10:50.386
Well, Ruffians!

10:51.167 --> 10:52.127
FUWAMOCO!

10:52.368 --> 10:55.350
We finally did it!

10:55.670 --> 10:58.172
It kinda made me wait a long time.

10:58.192 --> 10:59.493
A very long time.

11:00.834 --> 11:06.819
But we were finally able to chat long enough to read all the Super Chats!

11:06.879 --> 11:08.180
Yes!

11:08.440 --> 11:10.242
BAU BAU!

11:10.602 --> 11:13.785
From the period while we were moving to Japan!

11:14.085 --> 11:14.665
Yeah!

11:15.406 --> 11:26.095
It took us a solid 7 hours to read what we had left, but we had so much fun, you know, just being silly with you and talking about all the things we've been up to and experiencing!

11:26.155 --> 11:27.015
Yeah!

11:28.056 --> 11:32.761
I don't know if it was the same for you Ruffians, but the time for us went by in a flash.

11:32.841 --> 11:33.181
Yeah.

11:33.201 --> 11:36.104
We're just like, okay, we're just gonna chat with the Ruffians today.

11:36.164 --> 11:39.648
Then all of a sudden it was seven hours later.

11:39.668 --> 11:40.389
I should know too.

11:41.069 --> 11:43.432
Yeah, it felt like that.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.173
We just love chatting with you Ruffians.

11:46.034 --> 11:58.664
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for always supporting us and also for waiting so long for us during the bonkers time that we've been kind of going through since we got to Japan.

11:59.004 --> 11:59.424
Yeah.

11:59.604 --> 12:02.787
We still have the free chat from when we were moving last time.

12:02.807 --> 12:03.567
We haven't forgotten.

12:03.627 --> 12:04.308
No, no, no.

12:04.868 --> 12:06.530
So, thank you, Ruffians.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.611
Thank you for continuing to be patient.

12:08.691 --> 12:09.832
Thank you!

12:09.872 --> 12:11.433
Yeah.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.594
On the other hand, though,

12:14.281 --> 12:19.406
Why'd I notice Ruffians, you know, when we play dog organized neatly?

12:19.946 --> 12:23.449
This week, it's a bit of a super busy one for us.

12:23.489 --> 12:23.990
Is that a bit?

12:24.290 --> 12:26.332
Yeah, like every week this summer.

12:26.352 --> 12:26.852
Is that a bit?

12:27.092 --> 12:27.393
Yeah.

12:27.973 --> 12:35.199
But, uh, FUWAMOCO, our Ruffian battery, I don't know, it's very low.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.501
Very low.

12:36.541 --> 12:38.703
Like maybe we need to just get a new battery?

12:38.723 --> 12:38.803
Yeah.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.211
Yeah.

12:42.231 --> 12:43.671
We need you.

12:44.252 --> 12:44.872
Yeah.

12:45.252 --> 12:48.193
So, we're forcing some streams into our schedule.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.774
Display everything!

12:49.794 --> 12:50.595
Yay!

12:50.635 --> 12:51.655
Yeah.

12:51.975 --> 12:55.457
You know, that means that now we're gonna have to do a little bit...

12:56.203 --> 12:58.104
We're catching up again.

12:58.284 --> 13:00.785
But it'll be okay!

13:00.845 --> 13:04.687
We'll be able to chat a lot after Minecraft on the weekend.

13:07.648 --> 13:11.309
Thank you always, Ruffians!

13:12.010 --> 13:15.211
Moving and everything and all the busy, bonkers times.

13:15.511 --> 13:21.634
It's kind of been the perfect storm, but this whole waiting for FUWAMOCO, it won't happen again.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.881
Thank you, Ruffians, for being patient!

13:26.102 --> 13:30.248
We love to make the Ruffians cry!

13:32.111 --> 13:35.035
You love to make Fuwamoco cry and say things like that.

13:40.017 --> 13:42.018
Today is a celebratory day.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.978
Gonna start the day off on the right paw.

13:45.239 --> 13:45.619
Yeah.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.739
Yeah, cry for happiness.

13:46.859 --> 13:46.939
Oh!

13:46.979 --> 13:47.839
Is that what you meant?

13:47.999 --> 13:48.099
Oh.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.400
That's what you meant right.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.680
Yeah!

13:51.820 --> 13:53.921
BAU BAU!

13:55.702 --> 13:58.182
BAU BAU!

13:58.643 --> 14:01.143
I think you've been waiting for this, right Ruffians?

14:01.163 --> 14:04.884
Well, maybe a couple days ago.

14:05.885 --> 14:06.825
I kinda mentioned

14:08.459 --> 14:09.479
Fuwawa!

14:10.120 --> 14:12.842
I had an epic dream!

14:15.144 --> 14:16.385
An epic dream!

14:16.866 --> 14:17.426
Yeah!

14:18.327 --> 14:21.170
A fluffy dream, a very fluffy dream!

14:21.830 --> 14:22.411
Ruffians!

14:23.720 --> 14:36.165
You know how sometimes, you kind of, you know the times when you take like a small nap in the middle of the day because, you know, you're kind of starting to fall asleep while you're thinking about something.

14:36.185 --> 14:40.006
And it's just like, oh, that's not a good sign.

14:40.026 --> 14:40.847
Yeah.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.487
All of a sudden you're like, oh, I didn't sleep.

14:42.867 --> 14:43.268
Yeah.

14:43.608 --> 14:46.829
Well, I decided that, okay, I need to take a really quick nap.

14:46.849 --> 14:47.909
Just 30 minutes.

14:48.009 --> 14:49.050
Just 30 minutes.

14:49.070 --> 14:49.390
Yeah.

14:50.030 --> 14:51.531
And, oh my gosh!

14:52.935 --> 14:54.458
I had an epic dream.

14:54.738 --> 14:57.823
I think it took you longer than 30 minutes to explain it to me.

14:57.903 --> 14:58.344
Yeah, it's-

14:59.705 --> 15:04.069
I don't know, my dream must have been going at like two times speed.

15:04.330 --> 15:05.331
Only two times.

15:05.351 --> 15:06.312
I don't know.

15:07.052 --> 15:08.674
It was a lot that happened.

15:09.555 --> 15:11.336
Are you ready for it, Ruffians?

15:12.217 --> 15:18.263
I don't know, it's just one of those dreams where I'm amazed so much can happen within that 30 minutes.

15:18.824 --> 15:23.088
And when I woke up, I was like, oh, but it was so amazing.

15:24.509 --> 15:26.632
You're gonna take out your new pants!

15:26.672 --> 15:27.152
Wow!

15:28.013 --> 15:30.095
Okay, Ruffians!

15:30.336 --> 15:35.141
Okay, so in my dream... And by the way, I'm gonna say, this is a dream.

15:36.442 --> 15:37.423
Completely a dream.

15:37.523 --> 15:42.068
I did not fabricate, make up any portions of this story, okay?

15:42.168 --> 15:45.071
This is exactly how it was in my dream, okay?

15:45.592 --> 15:50.474
Yeah, and I wrote notes so I didn't forget about it, but I don't know if I really needed the notes because it's that big.

15:50.494 --> 15:51.714
It is not made up.

15:51.854 --> 15:54.935
It is not exactly how it was.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.697
Fuwawa's brain went asleep, unfortunately.

15:57.717 --> 15:57.977
Yeah.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.358
Yeah, okay.

16:02.498 --> 16:11.802
Anyways, in my dream, we were having a super special sleepover party with our holo IAN and JP-senpai!

16:12.362 --> 16:12.863
Yeah!

16:13.403 --> 16:16.624
It was such an amazing party!

16:17.364 --> 16:21.986
It was like a sleepover party, but it was like a rented venue, like a hotel or something.

16:22.026 --> 16:23.727
A rented venue!

16:23.767 --> 16:25.988
Yeah, like a hotel, because then it was like...

16:27.065 --> 16:29.287
It wasn't hotel rooms, but it was like bedrooms.

16:29.307 --> 16:30.868
Like, everybody had their own bedrooms.

16:30.988 --> 16:32.189
I don't know how that really worked.

16:32.609 --> 16:33.490
Magic, maybe.

16:33.730 --> 16:34.231
I don't know.

16:34.251 --> 16:36.652
Yeah, that's what happens with hololive.

16:36.733 --> 16:37.233
Magic.

16:37.953 --> 16:38.274
Yeah.

16:38.534 --> 16:42.097
But it wasn't just the Ien-senpai and JP-senpai!

16:42.477 --> 16:45.359
But also Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy were there!

16:45.379 --> 16:48.121
And other senpai's parents were there too!

16:48.141 --> 16:50.223
Yeah, everybody was there.

16:50.383 --> 16:50.763
I don't know.

16:51.864 --> 16:54.725
It was just such a fun and chaotic atmosphere.

16:55.005 --> 16:59.886
You know, there's yummy food and drinks and desserts and everyone was wrangling.

17:00.226 --> 17:03.547
This senpai talking with this person and everything.

17:03.988 --> 17:08.409
And some other puppy was there and she was talking with Biboo.

17:09.489 --> 17:12.230
And they were just having such a great time talking.

17:12.270 --> 17:13.570
They were like, oh yeah, FUWAMOCO.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.111
Oh, Biboo, what kind of games do you like?

17:15.191 --> 17:16.071
Oh, Zelda.

17:16.091 --> 17:17.552
Those kind of things.

17:17.952 --> 17:21.173
And then suddenly, Nenechi formed Mama Puppy.

17:21.193 --> 17:25.214
Then you could see Nenechi's, oh, Nenechi's forming Mama Puppy.

17:25.334 --> 17:26.255
Okay!

17:26.315 --> 17:27.215
Biboo was so excited.

17:27.235 --> 17:31.136
She's, yeah, I'm gonna talk with Mama Puppy and Nenechi at the same time.

17:31.156 --> 17:33.397
We're gonna have an awesome conversation.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.098
It's gonna be so much fun.

17:35.118 --> 17:38.219
And then, when Mama Puppy picked up the phone,

17:39.139 --> 17:43.004
It just turned out to be Mama Puppy's friend and the phone was just kind of bugging out.

17:43.364 --> 17:44.666
So Biboo is disappointed.

17:45.266 --> 17:46.087
Not Nenechi.

17:46.268 --> 17:47.209
Yeah, you know.

17:47.229 --> 17:53.716
It kind of makes sense because you know Nenechi is cooler and cuter than Mama Puppy's friend.

17:54.237 --> 17:56.379
So it makes sense to be kind of disappointed.

17:56.479 --> 17:56.640
Yeah.

17:57.597 --> 17:58.638
FUWAMOCO Morning!

17:59.099 --> 18:01.121
FUWAMOCO Morning!

18:15.837 --> 18:16.378
BAU BAU!

18:37.289 --> 18:40.451
Yeah, I was just so amazed, a little surprised.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.532
Just a bit.

18:41.572 --> 18:47.096
Yeah, but she looks so pretty and cool like a shoujo manga heroine.

18:47.376 --> 18:47.856
Yeah.

18:50.104 --> 18:53.326
Yeah, it was so much force, so much strength.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.789
Yeah, and I kind of wanted to get back at her.

18:56.989 --> 19:00.151
So then I picked her up, and I spun her around!

19:00.611 --> 19:02.912
And then, she did it to me again!

19:02.933 --> 19:04.213
She kame-doed you again!

19:04.554 --> 19:09.897
Not the kame-doe, we're just spinning each other around, like picking each other up and spinning each other around.

19:09.917 --> 19:10.918
No more friend things.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.039
Yeah, we're just laughing and laughing.

19:15.741 --> 19:23.427
It was so nice!

19:24.007 --> 19:28.691
Counter-attack!

19:28.791 --> 19:32.053
I could feel the reverberation in my bones.

19:32.694 --> 19:40.119
When Rui-senpai was like, pick you up, spin you around and around, and then BAM!

19:40.220 --> 19:41.300
Into the wall!

19:41.440 --> 19:42.181
Kind of thing.

19:43.623 --> 19:44.665
So strong!

19:45.347 --> 19:45.848
Oh yeah!

19:47.017 --> 19:50.360
It was really powerful, and then it was just so nice talking and laughing.

19:50.380 --> 19:54.443
Okay, this is not the end of the dream, no, Ruffians, this is nowhere near the end of the dream, okay?

19:54.503 --> 19:56.124
No, no, no.

19:56.224 --> 19:56.925
Continue, continue!

19:57.025 --> 20:00.508
But there was a lot going on, so then I saw Nerissa!

20:00.988 --> 20:15.780
Yeah, and I was just so happy, because suddenly Nerissa had all this obscure knowledge about Bishoujo Game and the companies and the staff who work on them, and I was able to talk to her about a bunch of different things that I never thought I could.

20:16.820 --> 20:20.161
So you were like, Nerissa, more if you could talk to her about that sort of stuff?

20:20.281 --> 20:22.462
I don't know, I was just really happy and excited.

20:22.482 --> 20:27.503
You know, we were talking about this old visual novel that was getting a new remake and all this stuff.

20:27.563 --> 20:34.545
And I was like, wow, Nerissa, I never knew you were interested in these things as much as me!

20:35.085 --> 20:38.986
She kind of kept it hidden, that's not very nice.

20:39.634 --> 20:40.334
Yeah.

20:41.735 --> 20:47.558
And you know, it was like a, I don't know, we rented a hotel or something, right?

20:47.598 --> 20:53.641
So it was like a big company-wide toast introduction thing kind of going on.

20:53.981 --> 20:57.663
And there was all these tables and everyone was sitting there and having nice food.

20:58.404 --> 21:00.264
And so we had to

21:01.365 --> 21:02.066
FUWAMOCO

21:17.308 --> 21:19.370
And so it was Moco-chan's turn!

21:19.731 --> 21:25.117
And her instructions were to introduce something you like, like your favorite thing, and then her name.

21:27.039 --> 21:28.240
So Moco-chan!

21:28.260 --> 21:37.469
Moco-chan said that her favorite drink is nenjyan, which is like a throat syrup that we've been drinking a ton recently because we've been practicing singing along.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.251
I like it, but it's not my favorite drink!

21:40.593 --> 21:41.996
She was like, I like it so much.

21:42.156 --> 21:42.817
I like ninja.

21:42.917 --> 21:46.083
And she took a sip of it from her glass that she was holding.

21:46.764 --> 21:50.371
And then she started getting really visually sick.

21:52.721 --> 21:55.304
And so I was like, oh, this is kind of embarrassing.

21:55.344 --> 22:01.710
Moco-chan, what are you doing saying this is your favorite thing and then getting sick because you took a sip of it?

22:02.251 --> 22:04.153
But I could tell it was gonna be bad.

22:04.173 --> 22:05.494
Ruffians!

22:06.555 --> 22:13.442
So Moco-chan was kind of like stumbling, kind of getting close to like a table that had a whole bunch of people eating at it.

22:14.122 --> 22:17.385
And so I kind of hurried along with her to the table.

22:18.005 --> 22:23.649
And I picked up this really nice glass centerpiece in the middle that kind of looked like it could hold some liquid.

22:25.651 --> 22:32.536
And then Moco- I did it just in time because then Moco-chan threw up clear- Do you know that thing's called Orbeez?

22:33.217 --> 22:35.498
She threw up clear Orbeez into it.

22:36.739 --> 22:38.440
They're like beads that hold water.

22:39.481 --> 22:40.141
Yeah!

22:42.222 --> 22:46.685
I don't know, it was kind of like... It became a beautiful centerpiece, kind of.

22:47.345 --> 22:55.149
But the girl that was across from her on the table was super rude and she was all like, That's so gross!

22:55.249 --> 22:56.250
I can't believe it!

22:56.310 --> 22:59.272
I can't stand people getting sick in front of me!

22:59.852 --> 23:01.133
And Ruffians...

23:02.009 --> 23:06.131
I can feel the anger that coursed through my body then.

23:06.151 --> 23:08.992
I got so mad at her!

23:09.512 --> 23:13.193
And I was all like, HA!

23:13.653 --> 23:13.993
What?

23:14.053 --> 23:16.234
It's not like she wanted to get sick!

23:16.334 --> 23:17.835
How could you be so rude?

23:18.215 --> 23:19.615
Have some compassion!

23:19.895 --> 23:21.956
And then the lady was just like, I just don't like it.

23:22.316 --> 23:22.956
It's gross.

23:23.337 --> 23:25.517
And we got into this huge brawl!

23:25.877 --> 23:28.078
Fists were flying everywhere!

23:28.558 --> 23:29.939
Everyone was just, ARGH!

23:30.319 --> 23:32.281
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

23:32.361 --> 23:34.002
Dishes were breaking!

23:34.423 --> 23:36.825
And other members were trying to hold me back!

23:37.325 --> 23:37.545
But!

23:38.146 --> 23:38.886
I prevailed!

23:39.267 --> 23:40.388
And I won the fight!

23:40.408 --> 23:43.070
And then she was all like, Oh Fuwawa!

23:43.390 --> 23:44.551
You're so strong!

23:44.871 --> 23:45.752
You were right!

23:45.832 --> 23:47.293
I'm so sorry!

23:47.854 --> 23:48.975
What is your wisdom?

23:51.324 --> 23:53.325
What is your wisdom?

23:53.906 --> 24:00.449
And I told her that she needed to have compassion and that because she didn't, she lost the fight.

24:01.410 --> 24:09.034
And that my three wisdoms were compassion, confidence, and loving yourself for who you are.

24:09.774 --> 24:10.875
Those are my wisdoms.

24:11.515 --> 24:13.296
And she was like, wow.

24:14.096 --> 24:14.477
Yeah.

24:15.197 --> 24:16.037
It was crazy.

24:16.057 --> 24:17.938
And that was it!

24:19.500 --> 24:26.121
I went over to the food and drink tables and they had enemies.

24:28.826 --> 24:31.247
They had this amazing smoothie bar!

24:31.727 --> 24:34.769
So I made myself a really good smoothie.

24:34.809 --> 24:39.211
It had like mangoes, like fresh mangoes, bananas, and strawberries.

24:39.491 --> 24:42.213
It was so good.

24:42.253 --> 24:45.555
People around me were really envious of my smoothie.

24:45.575 --> 24:48.456
They were like, wow, that looks like such a good smoothie.

24:48.476 --> 24:49.357
Can I have a sip?

24:49.877 --> 24:49.957
No.

24:51.318 --> 24:57.803
And then, I was kind of wandering around.

24:57.823 --> 25:01.326
And I went into Nerissa's room.

25:01.346 --> 25:05.089
I don't know why.

25:05.189 --> 25:09.212
I don't know if it's the room that Nerissa is going to be sleeping in.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.534
And I thought, oh, this is interesting.

25:11.834 --> 25:17.079
Because I found... I found some of my underwear there!

25:19.285 --> 25:22.767
And it wasn't like it was suspicious or anything.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.267
I was like, oh!

25:24.587 --> 25:25.828
This is where these went!

25:25.948 --> 25:27.628
I finally found them!

25:28.149 --> 25:28.749
Yeah!

25:28.889 --> 25:30.550
More underwear!

25:30.870 --> 25:32.550
And then just kind of went on my way.

25:32.871 --> 25:34.151
Yeah, not suspicious.

25:34.211 --> 25:34.611
Yeah.

25:36.672 --> 25:40.534
And then I bumped into somebody who's really, really cool.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.815
Like they kind of look like, um, uh, what's it?

25:44.355 --> 25:51.681
Harley Quinn, they had like a bunch of colorful hair and makeup and cool clothes, really fashionable.

25:52.221 --> 25:56.144
And so I asked her, like she kind of looked like she was lost.

25:56.824 --> 26:00.487
So I asked her if I could help in Japanese for some reason.

26:01.007 --> 26:05.771
And she responded back to me in Japanese that she was Calli-senpai's manager.

26:06.131 --> 26:10.094
And she was looking for Calli-senpai to give her a bunch of gifts from fans.

26:11.335 --> 26:13.216
So, I just kind of pointed her somewhere.

26:13.276 --> 26:17.117
I really had no clue where Calli's sofa was, but I was sure she was around.

26:17.137 --> 26:18.297
Yeah, it's a big party.

26:18.337 --> 26:18.877
Yeah.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.778
But, she was super cool.

26:21.178 --> 26:21.818
Yeah.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.559
She really looked like she just came out of a comic book.

26:25.379 --> 26:25.760
Yeah.

26:26.200 --> 26:31.001
And then, I, like, you know it's been busy, a busy party, I go into a brawl.

26:31.021 --> 26:31.481
Yeah.

26:31.501 --> 26:33.982
So I decided to go take a rest on a sofa.

26:34.002 --> 26:36.743
And I noticed that Kevin Lamar

26:37.304 --> 26:37.985
Arrival.

26:51.187 --> 26:57.911
But, uh, I did, I did make out some of the things he said, and his words I remember very vividly.

26:57.931 --> 27:01.634
These are the exact words that he said, he said to the interviewer.

27:02.074 --> 27:07.177
I can't believe I made bank singing rap songs about cheese.

27:09.059 --> 27:11.640
Yeah, and then I woke up.

27:12.801 --> 27:14.802
It was crazy Ruffians!

27:14.863 --> 27:15.103
What?

27:16.616 --> 27:21.859
And this is why I don't let mama tell me her dreams anymore, okay?

27:22.399 --> 27:23.520
Yeah.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.921
This is what it is like, okay?

27:26.282 --> 27:27.602
Is there any reason to it?

27:27.742 --> 27:28.263
No.

27:29.463 --> 27:29.804
Yeah.

27:31.945 --> 27:34.866
That was my dream.

27:36.667 --> 27:38.148
Her best dream ever.

27:38.829 --> 27:40.349
Yeah, in 30 minutes.

27:40.510 --> 27:41.030
Who knew?

27:41.370 --> 27:43.551
Who knew I could have such a dream like that?

27:43.691 --> 27:44.332
I love you.

27:46.448 --> 27:47.468
That's what it's like!

27:47.569 --> 27:48.989
There's too much detail!

27:49.009 --> 27:51.430
What's the punchline?

27:51.450 --> 27:52.751
There is no punchline!

27:52.831 --> 27:53.471
It's a dream!

27:53.491 --> 27:56.493
It was 13 minutes of dreams!

27:56.953 --> 28:01.235
And this is why I don't like her!

28:01.415 --> 28:03.536
I don't need to know it!

28:03.596 --> 28:06.077
I didn't even tell you the color of the sofa either.

28:06.097 --> 28:07.578
That's the thing.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.009
Yeah.

28:11.830 --> 28:13.471
BAU BAU!

28:13.631 --> 28:18.855
BAU BAU!

28:18.956 --> 28:20.016
Ruffians!

28:23.159 --> 28:25.941
After that, I feel a little tired.

28:25.961 --> 28:27.202
Do you need a nap?

28:27.222 --> 28:29.444
Do you need a bit of a...

28:31.354 --> 28:32.415
Me up!

28:33.015 --> 28:38.019
Are you gonna make us a really amazing fruit smoothie, Moco-chan?

28:38.079 --> 28:38.440
No!

28:39.000 --> 28:41.162
I could if I wanted to, but I don't want to.

28:42.723 --> 28:44.344
What are you gonna do then?

28:45.545 --> 28:52.530
It's not an amazing fruit smoothie, but... What about a pup talk?

28:52.670 --> 28:54.052
BAU BAU!

29:00.413 --> 29:02.034
BAU BAU!

29:02.375 --> 29:03.415
Ruffians!

29:04.536 --> 29:08.599
It's been a while, but it's that time again!

29:09.360 --> 29:14.624
It's time that you're gonna listen up because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

29:15.465 --> 29:19.047
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

29:19.067 --> 29:24.031
Have you been a bit busy recently, Ruffians?

29:25.052 --> 29:28.835
You know, somehow it's gotten a busy time of year.

29:30.171 --> 29:30.471
Right?

29:31.492 --> 29:33.913
What do you mean?

29:35.634 --> 29:36.375
It's always?

29:38.376 --> 29:41.938
Well, maybe, but anyways!

29:42.478 --> 29:46.561
Despite being so busy, you're here right now!

29:47.021 --> 29:47.761
You woke up!

29:48.722 --> 29:50.383
And you're gonna do amazing today.

29:51.964 --> 29:55.005
You might doubt yourself, but solve that!

29:55.906 --> 29:57.367
You're gonna do amazing today!

29:59.309 --> 29:59.549
Okay?

30:00.189 --> 30:01.070
Don't doubt yourself.

30:01.670 --> 30:02.310
You're wrong!

30:03.371 --> 30:06.192
Everyone else around you believes in you!

30:06.212 --> 30:07.933
I believe in you!

30:09.013 --> 30:13.175
So, you have to cut that out and start to believe in yourself too, okay?

30:14.095 --> 30:15.136
Repeat after me!

30:15.696 --> 30:15.916
Huh?

30:17.577 --> 30:19.818
I am going to make today a good day!

30:19.838 --> 30:19.918
Okay?

30:22.459 --> 30:23.019
Repeat it now.

30:25.100 --> 30:25.280
Huh?

30:26.806 --> 30:30.447
Things won't go perfectly, but I'll do my best!

30:37.088 --> 30:37.548
Great job.

30:38.188 --> 30:44.550
You know, maybe you won't get everything done that you needed to do, but you'll get a good part of things done.

30:45.050 --> 30:46.350
And that's what matters, okay?

30:47.791 --> 30:49.511
Be proud of the hard work of yours.

30:50.461 --> 30:51.522
I know I am, okay?

30:52.283 --> 30:54.144
No matter what, you can do it!

30:54.164 --> 30:54.885
For sure!

30:55.545 --> 30:57.327
Let's all work hard together, okay?

30:57.967 --> 30:59.408
Ganbatte ne!

30:59.488 --> 31:00.829
BAU BAU!

31:00.849 --> 31:01.870
BAU BAU!

31:05.031 --> 31:06.152
Ruffians!

31:06.712 --> 31:10.254
It might be the middle of the week, but I think you're good to go!

31:10.314 --> 31:12.076
You can do it!

31:12.116 --> 31:14.117
FUWAMOCO-chan, let's take a look.

31:14.677 --> 31:16.438
Who's the Doggie of the Day today?

31:16.618 --> 31:19.440
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

31:19.680 --> 31:21.922
Today's Doggie of the Day is Molly!

31:22.062 --> 31:23.803
Molly!

31:24.564 --> 31:25.884
She's so flat!

31:26.365 --> 31:27.545
And long!

31:27.886 --> 31:28.926
She's stuck on the stairs.

31:28.946 --> 31:29.967
That's what I was wondering.

31:30.047 --> 31:34.330
You know, Molly is a wiener dog and has short legs.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.771
So, maybe she's stuck.

31:37.311 --> 31:38.471
What, what dog?

31:39.752 --> 31:41.953
Moc- Moc- Maki!

31:42.213 --> 31:43.973
Maki!

31:44.814 --> 31:46.775
Mali kinda looks like Maki, right?

31:46.895 --> 31:47.455
Why?

31:47.515 --> 31:48.355
Not in jail.

31:49.015 --> 31:51.356
Mali has never done anything wrong.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.878
Mali is free, but she might be trapped on the stairs.

31:54.898 --> 31:56.198
She chooses to be there, okay?

31:56.238 --> 31:57.699
Can she climb down?

31:57.719 --> 31:58.879
Should she roll down?

31:59.859 --> 32:00.480
Both is good.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.101
How does Mali BAU BAU?

32:05.145 --> 32:05.646
BAU BAU!

32:05.826 --> 32:06.447
BAU BAU!

32:06.948 --> 32:08.210
I think she can be louder.

32:08.270 --> 32:08.590
Oh, really?

32:13.871 --> 32:17.014
There's times when she's quiet, but why be quiet when she can be loud?

32:18.315 --> 32:20.356
That's very chuumoko-chan.

32:20.757 --> 32:24.800
Molly is a hot dog stuck on the stairs right now.

32:24.820 --> 32:31.385
You know, she's doing her all to tell you with those big puppy dog eyes, I'm stuck on the stairs!

32:32.086 --> 32:34.748
But, you know, she really wants you to help her down.

32:34.768 --> 32:35.448
Will you?

32:35.748 --> 32:38.531
Will you help her up the stairs?

32:39.511 --> 32:40.232
She's like your dog.

32:45.031 --> 32:45.973
BAU BAU!

32:51.414 --> 32:54.555
Well, Ruffians, it's getting hot outside.

32:54.615 --> 32:59.437
The summer is here, but you're still making sure to stretch those paws, right?

32:59.477 --> 32:59.877
Right!

33:00.538 --> 33:06.680
Well, for today I read on a book, we have De-den!

33:06.700 --> 33:10.141
A sudden bunny!

33:10.161 --> 33:16.004
I like cicadas, but suddenly flying onto you.

33:16.024 --> 33:16.964
It's a bit much.

33:17.344 --> 33:18.825
Did you get stuck?

33:20.162 --> 33:21.163
Kinda looks like a frog.

33:21.243 --> 33:24.204
I don't know which one would be better if it was a cicada or a frog.

33:24.224 --> 33:25.045
I don't know.

33:25.105 --> 33:26.866
I don't think the Ruffians like it either.

33:27.186 --> 33:28.086
A frog?

33:28.406 --> 33:29.647
Right, it looks like a frog.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.448
It's a cicada though.

33:31.868 --> 33:34.910
I don't know, it's pretty amazing to be able to take a photo like this.

33:34.970 --> 33:35.930
You didn't panic.

33:36.871 --> 33:37.431
Right.

33:37.491 --> 33:37.911
Right.

33:38.032 --> 33:38.712
You'd scream.

33:38.732 --> 33:39.853
You think so?

33:40.433 --> 33:42.834
It kinda looks like, you know, just a cicada shell, but nope.

33:43.314 --> 33:44.895
Nope, he's still in there.

33:45.235 --> 33:47.957
I would definitely smash it before looking at it.

33:50.174 --> 33:50.634
Reflect.

33:50.775 --> 33:52.136
I don't think that's an answer.

33:52.456 --> 33:53.837
But, uh... Oh, Pony!

33:54.077 --> 33:56.939
Hopefully he didn't get stuck in your hair once he flew away!

33:56.959 --> 33:57.000
No!

33:57.020 --> 34:01.383
That would be really scary!

34:03.765 --> 34:05.726
I'm glad that you were okay with it.

34:06.107 --> 34:07.488
And that he found a good friend.

34:07.808 --> 34:08.028
Yeah.

34:08.529 --> 34:09.910
And... A++ on the photo.

34:12.388 --> 34:23.370
Today's Question of the Day we have... De-den!

34:23.750 --> 34:25.451
Hi FUWAMOCO!

34:25.791 --> 34:29.532
I know it'll be your first time watching Hachi, A Dog's Tale, right?

34:29.572 --> 34:31.632
With the doggy pack this weekend, right?

34:31.672 --> 34:32.092
Yeah!

34:32.412 --> 34:35.613
I want to ask you, do you know the story of Hachiko?

34:35.633 --> 34:37.133
Heard about it before.

34:37.473 --> 34:41.394
There's a memorial statue of him outside Shibuya Station in Tokyo.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.875
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

34:43.975 --> 34:45.335
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

34:45.355 --> 34:47.476
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

34:47.656 --> 34:49.357
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

34:49.477 --> 34:50.998
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm FUWAMOCO!

35:10.225 --> 35:17.135
A bunch of hachi merch that she really wanted to buy, so I was like, maybe I should learn a bit more about hachi.

35:17.155 --> 35:20.720
We're looking forward to it!

35:20.740 --> 35:22.763
Ruffians, you know much about hachiko.

35:24.683 --> 35:28.366
I think the movie is really popular though.

35:28.646 --> 35:30.848
We're looking forward to it, Ruffians!

35:31.068 --> 35:33.089
BAU BAU!

35:33.490 --> 35:37.152
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions.

35:38.273 --> 35:43.817
I'm sure, Ruffians, there's more than a few of you that want to be a bigger part of FUWAMOCO Morning.

35:45.731 --> 35:46.331
Right!

35:46.872 --> 35:47.432
Yeah!

35:47.472 --> 35:56.499
So if you do, use the hashtag FWMCMORNING and send us pictures of the walks that you go on!

35:56.519 --> 35:56.859
Yeah!

35:56.879 --> 36:01.903
And maybe you have a doggie of your life where you can make them a Doggie of the Day!

36:01.923 --> 36:02.304
Yeah!

36:02.464 --> 36:07.347
You know, if you have any questions, we have very good questions all the time, Ruffians.

36:07.588 --> 36:08.708
Ask us, okay?

36:08.728 --> 36:09.049
Yeah!

36:09.249 --> 36:12.211
Or maybe you see Pero out and about.

36:12.591 --> 36:13.612
Please let us know, okay?

36:13.632 --> 36:14.373
Report it, okay?

36:15.393 --> 36:19.297
BAU BAU!

36:19.557 --> 36:28.505
For our next stream, we have... Donkey Kong Country 2!

36:29.486 --> 36:34.110
We've been playing Donkey Kong Country 2 together on our SNES.

36:34.330 --> 36:35.091
Now the question is...

36:37.312 --> 36:39.254
Iceness has been doing its best, but apparently...

36:54.318 --> 36:56.581
Well, I think it might have went off once.

36:56.781 --> 36:57.222
I don't know.

36:57.342 --> 36:57.763
I don't know.

36:58.083 --> 37:02.890
But we're gonna see together with you, Ruffians, what kind of state it is in.

37:03.070 --> 37:05.193
We don't know the answer, but we will see.

37:05.413 --> 37:08.477
And then we'll have a bunch of fun playing Donkey Kong Country 2.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.959
It's been one month and two weeks.

37:11.521 --> 37:11.662
How?

37:13.899 --> 37:14.739
We'll see what happens.

37:15.039 --> 37:15.639
Yeah!

37:16.320 --> 37:18.300
BAU BAU!

37:18.360 --> 37:20.061
And our schedule!

37:20.421 --> 37:24.522
We're gonna be playing Donkey Kong Country 2, but also more Touhou!

37:25.362 --> 37:29.983
My senpai taught us a bunch, so we're gonna see just how much we've improved since then.

37:30.003 --> 37:31.364
Kanako again.

37:31.384 --> 37:31.984
Right.

37:32.044 --> 37:34.365
We're gonna be playing also Membembe!

37:34.445 --> 37:36.145
Membembe!

37:36.385 --> 37:38.186
Not a spelling error!

37:38.226 --> 37:38.826
Membembe!

37:38.906 --> 37:39.826
Membembe Radio!

37:40.026 --> 37:41.226
It's a Japanese ending.

37:44.380 --> 37:44.921
BAU BAU!

38:01.841 --> 38:06.782
Thank you so much for joining us today through the archive!

38:06.842 --> 38:08.903

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!
