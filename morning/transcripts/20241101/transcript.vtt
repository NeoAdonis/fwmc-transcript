00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.351
Oh my god, I'm a Ruffian's husband.

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.554
BAU BAU!

00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:43.835
I'll do that for you.

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:48.599
Let's make it a great little camera cam.

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.720
I already know it's right before.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.664
On the weekend, the first day of November too.

00:06:55.684 --> 00:06:57.806
I want a big one's husband.

00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:58.607
BAU BAU!

00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:06.328
It's the start of a new month!

00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:23.932
I totally really need Pero today.

00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:25.033
Is that what you want?

00:07:25.593 --> 00:07:26.213
Right away!

00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:30.495
I don't want to see him first thing in the morning of a brand new month.

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:32.555
You wake up, open your eyes, Pero.

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:34.756
Right above you, smack dab in your face.

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:35.596
Pero.

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:36.757
Hi.

00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:37.937
No.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:41.378
FUWAMOCO-chan, was there a Pero Sighting or not?

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:42.439
There was.

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:45.420
There was!

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.380
Oh wait.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.822
Wait, did you see Pero this time, Ruffians?

00:07:50.922 --> 00:07:51.702
Let's take a look.

00:07:55.762 --> 00:07:56.723
De-den!

00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:57.724
BAU BAU!

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:58.625
Wait, wait!

00:07:59.266 --> 00:07:59.927
Pero!

00:08:00.328 --> 00:08:00.808
Pero!

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:03.792
Koji Mischievous.

00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:06.856
Singapore's Famous Merlin!

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:08.137
Merlin!

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:09.279
BAU BAU!

00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:15.467
He was splashing around in the water and taking a drink!

00:08:15.507 --> 00:08:17.688
Are you sure you want to do that?

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:18.229
I don't know.

00:08:18.549 --> 00:08:19.349
That's not good.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.191
It's not good, Pero.

00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:22.272
It's really bad.

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:23.753
It's sort of embarrassing.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:27.335
I don't know.

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:29.657
He ended up causing all that trouble.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:35.541
Maybe Moco-chan will just have to go to Singapore and show him his top dog!

00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:36.161
Hi!

00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:37.122
That's so nice!

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:37.522
Hi!

00:08:39.362 --> 00:08:40.163
Is this a threat?

00:08:40.243 --> 00:08:41.324
A threat to Pero?

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:45.048
It's a threat and also, you know, travel plans.

00:08:45.628 --> 00:08:47.750
Maybe sometime around the end of the month.

00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:49.652
You know?

00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:53.075
Because you know there's an event going on.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.818
Awesome!

00:08:56.745 --> 00:09:00.548
Hi, Emi!

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:03.210
Just you wait for us, Pero, you know!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.810
Just wait!

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.193
We'll take care of you, yeah!

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:15.559
Yeah, just have to wait a little bit, but... Moorlion's pretty cool.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:20.182
Reminds me of the time that I became a moorlion.

00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:26.418
Maybe we should fly out to Moco-chan, Merlion, huh?

00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:29.361
No, I can't remember why, but I remember that it happened.

00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:30.762
Yeah.

00:09:32.183 --> 00:09:37.126
Well, we'll just have to go see the real Merlion soon, Moco-chan!

00:09:37.427 --> 00:09:37.847
Yeah!

00:09:38.007 --> 00:09:40.889
Oh, we're excited to go there!

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:42.310
See you soon, Merlion.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.151
And I guess Pero.

00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:45.192
BAU BAU!

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:54.426
Ruffians, it's a brand new month and you know in Halloween and everything there's a lot going on.

00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:57.609
Yeah, a lot of excitement, a lot of new things.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:03.913
And one of those things was, Halloween Senpai, she just had a brand new 3D concert.

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:05.594
J-Rap and Jigoku.

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:05.975
Woohoo!

00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:06.995
We were there!

00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:07.276
Bye!

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:07.436
Bye!

Have a howl of a day!

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.656
Oh my gosh!

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:43.707
No!

00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:08.869
I just danced.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.072
I danced and danced.

00:11:10.612 --> 00:11:12.195
Together with Rupo-chan and Karin-san.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.920
We did our best together, all three of us!

00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:20.630
My favorite part was, you know, the part where you kind of get to, you know...

00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:22.035
Oshiri?

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:22.475
Oshiri?

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:25.557
Otherwise I like the part that's like...

00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:44.628
That part?

00:11:44.968 --> 00:11:45.409
That part?

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:46.129
Oh!

00:11:46.249 --> 00:11:47.309
I know that part!

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.909
Yeah!

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:49.090
Yeah!

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.251
I think Calli-senpai and I, we do the robot together!

00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:53.932
We tried!

00:11:54.572 --> 00:11:55.972
Calli-senpai!

00:11:56.012 --> 00:11:57.353
Calli-senpai and I!

00:11:57.453 --> 00:11:58.313
Calli-senpai!

00:11:58.613 --> 00:11:59.734
Calli-senpai and I!

00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:01.374
We tried doing, what's it?

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:02.795
Popping and walking!

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:06.256
Yeah, I do that a little bit too!

00:12:06.276 --> 00:12:11.778
I don't think it really worked out for me, huh?

00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:14.739
It was a lot of fun.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:17.020
I did my best too!

00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:20.842
It was so much fun singing all together.

00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:21.382
Yeah!

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:25.124
And then we got the big hug from Calli-senpai!

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:25.865
Yeah!

00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:32.028
Moco-chan, did you get electrocuted by Calli-senpai's hug or something?

00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:32.848
I don't know!

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:34.450

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:13:07.761 --> 00:13:08.421
Yeah.

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:11.483
She looks great now, right?

00:13:11.563 --> 00:13:12.743
So different.

00:13:12.803 --> 00:13:13.364
Yeah.

00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:14.704
It was so easy, right?

00:13:14.824 --> 00:13:15.925
Yeah!

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:16.665
I know.

00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:19.846
And the songs that she sung and everything was so good.

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:21.667
It was so much fun.

00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:28.890
And then also, Kelly-senpai revealed a brand new song called Flashback by P.E.S.S.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.251
So please go check it out, Ruffians.

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:32.792
The visuals are very cute too.

00:13:32.872 --> 00:13:33.693
It's really cute.

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:36.614
Apparently there's some things hidden in the visuals too, so...

00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:39.297
Maybe I'll have to find the Ruffians.

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:41.050
BAU BAU!

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.673
Congratulations Calli-senpai!

00:13:42.753 --> 00:13:45.516
You notice that Calli-senpai is a little taller now?

00:13:45.537 --> 00:13:51.805
A bit taller You can't really notice here because she's sort of like BAU BAU!

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.533
We had so much fun!

00:14:00.613 --> 00:14:01.694
Mom!

00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:02.135
Mom!

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:03.416
Mom!

00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:04.337
Shiori!

00:14:04.597 --> 00:14:06.438
Yeah!

00:14:06.739 --> 00:14:08.721
She had her big 3D Halloween too!

00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:11.843
Did you check it out, Ruffians?

00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:13.205
It was so cool!

00:14:13.345 --> 00:14:15.086
So amazing!

00:14:15.106 --> 00:14:16.267
We were there too!

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:17.048
Yeah, included!

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:17.769
Lots of novelty!

00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:19.678
But then!

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.748
See what surprised us?

00:14:21.768 --> 00:14:24.743
There's a brand new cover song called Dark Night!

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:24.924
Yeah!

00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:26.290
BAU BAU!

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:27.577
BAU BAU!

00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:31.475
That was so so amazing!

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.636
I wasn't expecting it.

00:14:32.697 --> 00:14:33.557
I was like, what?

00:14:33.617 --> 00:14:39.203
Shiori already had an amazing Halloween stream and then a coffee song too!

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:44.749
And this time you know, I feel like we got to hear a little bit of a different Shiori.

00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:46.370
The chorus is very difficult.

00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:46.991
Why?

00:14:49.063 --> 00:14:56.625
We're just so happy to hear more singing from Shiori because we love Shiori singing voice too.

00:15:04.588 --> 00:15:05.888
FUWAMOCO!

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.901
Ruffians, like you mentioned.

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:34.642
It's official.

00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:36.342
It is November.

00:15:36.963 --> 00:15:37.683
I'm not ready.

00:15:37.823 --> 00:15:39.124
I feel like it's still May.

00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:44.446
At least if it's not May, it's definitely September.

00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:46.247
Definitely.

00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:48.772
Definitely September.

00:15:48.832 --> 00:15:49.713
It's November now.

00:15:50.373 --> 00:16:06.227
Well, Ruffians, we wanted to say a big thank you to all the very creative Ruffians and hololisteners for all their music illustrations during holo-OCTOBER!

00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:13.513
If we didn't have holo-OCTOBER, just combining hololive and October together, I still don't get this.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:18.094
Wow, you know, it can be also holo-November, but holo-October!

00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:25.835
It's actually an initiative started by Iofi-senpai, where every single day is a different theme.

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.035
Like a different prompt.

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:30.056
Yeah, a drawing prompt, a creative prompt.

00:16:30.196 --> 00:16:33.977
And then you draw a picture of whatever comes to mind there.

00:16:33.997 --> 00:16:41.418
Well, you see, I think most people draw, but you can do anything, you know, any sort of creative work.

00:16:42.378 --> 00:16:43.538
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.184
The cheerleader day was very cute too!

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:12.628
The dedication that it takes to do so many days.

00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:19.556
I know sometimes you see artists being like, I didn't get all the days or I could only complete this many days.

00:17:20.877 --> 00:17:22.299
You're thinking about it wrong.

00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:24.942
Not, I only was able to do this.

00:17:26.152 --> 00:17:28.154

<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:48.272
Thank you FUWAMOCO!

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:21.300
BAU BAU!

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.620
Wow!

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.121
It feels like about a year ago we were also talking about this!

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:28.842
But!

00:18:28.962 --> 00:18:30.902
There's been some exciting updates!

00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:31.683
Yeah!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.523
Some exciting updates!

00:18:33.703 --> 00:18:44.486
Wow, it was just announced that back in Tokyo Station, starting November 14th, there will be a pop-up store back in the Tokyo County again!

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:45.126
BAU BAU!

00:18:46.646 --> 00:18:48.067
FUWAMOCO!

00:18:48.087 --> 00:18:49.267
Look!

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:53.650
And everybody's in these cute outfits!

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.632
They should attend an official shop!

00:18:57.712 --> 00:19:03.135
Tokyo Character Street is very famous!

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:07.798
You know, lots of different characters have their stores in there.

00:19:08.838 --> 00:19:13.041
Sanrio Hello Kitty.

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:13.841
Gudetama.

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:16.603
Those kind of big characters, they're all there!

00:19:16.643 --> 00:19:17.363
That's a big deal!

00:19:17.443 --> 00:19:18.844
That's a big deal!

00:19:18.864 --> 00:19:21.846
You know, right there with the big ones.

00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:27.390
And you know, you can see a bunch of us right here!

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.451
ID JPEH.

00:19:29.531 --> 00:19:30.411
Shiori!

00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:35.234
You know, in the original station attendant outfit.

00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:35.875
Right?

00:19:36.315 --> 00:19:38.356
So so cute!

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:41.398
Kaya-senpai is still very very cool!

00:19:41.798 --> 00:19:42.518
Yeah!

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:48.061
But there'll be lots of merch limited to the location being on sale there!

00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.942
So we hope that you'll go check it out!

00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:55.465
There'll also be some in-store announcements by the resident newbie!

00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:57.046
Nodoka!

00:19:57.226 --> 00:19:59.747
Does she really count as a newbie?

00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:01.548
She called herself a newbie!

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:03.709
I don't know about that though.

00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:04.610
You see Biboo,

00:20:06.545 --> 00:20:08.666
Where are you, Biboo?

00:20:08.706 --> 00:20:09.787
So fun!

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:14.149
We are both short, but... Biboo!

00:20:14.189 --> 00:20:14.489
What?

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:18.271
It's a little bit of a darker Biboo.

00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:19.211
Yeah.

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:24.634
But we have to go to the store.

00:20:24.694 --> 00:20:27.015
Well, right now, you know, it's just open.

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.396
It's gonna be pretty busy.

00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:31.417
So you need to reserve an entry ticket

00:20:31.517 --> 00:20:41.022
For the first few days here, in case you didn't know, Ruffians, often for events like this, even if it's buying merch, you need an entry ticket.

00:20:41.062 --> 00:20:42.783
You need an entry ticket.

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:45.044
You just need to reserve it in advance.

00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:54.790
Just remember that sometimes, even if you want to go to a store to buy some merchandise, if it's busy, you might need to get a special reservation ticket.

00:20:56.391 --> 00:20:59.712
So please make sure you check out everything before you like... Okay!

00:20:59.873 --> 00:21:00.393
Oh my god!

00:21:00.413 --> 00:21:00.713
Tokyo Station!

00:21:00.733 --> 00:21:02.774
We don't want you to be disappointed!

00:21:02.974 --> 00:21:05.916
Although, you know, after the first little bit, it might be a bit...

00:21:06.684 --> 00:21:09.806
Please check it out, Ruffians!

00:21:09.846 --> 00:21:14.188
There'll be more updates, I think, coming soon, too!

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.770
There's lots of cute words, so please check it out!

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.090
BAU BAU!

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:22.072
And a continuation of the exciting updates!

00:21:22.953 --> 00:21:29.296
For Ruffians who really enjoy it and recommend it, we have this FUWAMOCO style blanket!

00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:33.799
We saw you noticed so many Ruffians, so many listeners saying,

00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:36.360
I want the cloak for myself.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.361
And now you know it's November, it's officially starting to get warm.

00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:44.502
Have you turned on your heating yet, Ruffians?

00:21:44.522 --> 00:21:54.344
Maybe you know you can have a little bit of a revelation in comfort and warmth with this Lobesta Cloak Style Blanket.

00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:59.566
It's a revelation to comfort and warmth, okay?

00:22:01.206 --> 00:22:02.967
So please go check it out.

00:22:03.487 --> 00:22:10.429
I'm sure you'll be able to get lots of use out of it throughout this colder time period.

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:14.510
And then, you know, before you know it, you'll start feeling warmer.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.811
Did you notice what Ina-senpai is saying?

00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:18.852
What is she saying, Moco-chan?

00:22:18.872 --> 00:22:20.112
In a matching style.

00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:27.114
In a... Cause it's Ina-senpai!

00:22:28.074 --> 00:22:29.115
I see that there.

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:30.035
I think she could do better.

00:22:33.013 --> 00:22:35.954
FUWAMOCO Please check it out, Ruffians!

00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:40.115
You can find it on the online official hololive shopbooking!

00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:45.416
BAU BAU!

00:22:45.436 --> 00:22:58.980
Well, Ruffians... It's been a little while... But Ruffians... We actually have... A bit of a confession for you!

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.000
Compassion!

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.241
Ruffians!

00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:06.362
Not a misunderstanding, okay?

00:23:07.482 --> 00:23:12.203
Well, there's been something that's kind of been weighing on us for quite a while.

00:23:12.223 --> 00:23:12.303
Yeah.

00:23:13.023 --> 00:23:15.384
A few months here.

00:23:15.764 --> 00:23:17.845
You know, we're senpai now.

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:18.925
We're senpai now!

00:23:19.085 --> 00:23:21.146
You know, just this debut.

00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:23.146
Everyone's so unique.

00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:26.547
They all have their own member colors.

00:23:26.687 --> 00:23:27.047
Red.

00:23:27.127 --> 00:23:28.108
Green.

00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:29.448
Yellow.

00:23:30.115 --> 00:23:40.183
When we collab with Ame-senpai, you know, we said that we're so happy because you know, all the Holo-EN blondes are together!

00:23:40.203 --> 00:23:40.603
Right!

00:23:40.663 --> 00:23:43.886
We're all together for the first time Holo-EN blondes!

00:23:43.946 --> 00:23:44.746
Yeah!

00:23:44.806 --> 00:23:45.767
BAU BAU!

00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:52.112
And you know, Ame-senpai, we isn't GG blonde though.

00:23:52.572 --> 00:23:53.093
Yeah!

00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:57.418
Have a howl of a day!

00:23:57.538 --> 00:24:01.682
And then... Yeah, I guess if Ame-senpai's saying Gigi's blonde, then yeah!

00:24:02.022 --> 00:24:03.784
We've been a bit in crisis.

00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:04.364
Yeah!

00:24:04.764 --> 00:24:05.925
Is Gigi blonde?

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:06.786
Gigi's blonde!

00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:08.207
Have we been excluding her?

00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:11.530
How can we do that as senpai?

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.031
Right!

00:24:12.491 --> 00:24:15.093
Oh my gosh, what can we do?

00:24:15.133 --> 00:24:15.954
What should we do?

00:24:15.974 --> 00:24:18.636
So we've been kind of living in hiding.

00:24:18.656 --> 00:24:20.338
Right, in crisis.

00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:25.322
Is Gigi blonde and we just misunderstood the whole entire time?

00:24:26.223 --> 00:24:29.045
But Ruffians, we asked the source.

00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.067
We finally did it.

00:24:31.127 --> 00:24:32.649
We got to the bottom of it.

00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:35.671
We got the words and we asked Gigi herself.

00:24:36.172 --> 00:24:40.576
Gigi, are you blonde?

00:24:41.236 --> 00:24:41.677
She goes...

00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:43.153
No.

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:47.537
Gigi's the blood mafia!

00:24:47.618 --> 00:24:50.301
She has brown hair!

00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:51.242
Yeah!

00:24:51.762 --> 00:24:53.044
It's okay!

00:24:53.064 --> 00:24:59.190
We were horrible selves but it's a good way to spend our time!

00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:06.037
Yeah, she has brown hair with lighter brown hair!

00:25:06.217 --> 00:25:12.263
Yeah, it's not blonde!

00:25:12.684 --> 00:25:13.725
That's the confession.

00:25:14.165 --> 00:25:16.768
We were in turmoil forever.

00:25:16.868 --> 00:25:23.095
We can live happier days knowing that Gigi is in fact not blonde.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.297
We weren't excluding her now.

00:25:25.841 --> 00:25:27.823
BAU BAU!

00:25:27.883 --> 00:25:31.827
We just need to ask questions.

00:25:31.888 --> 00:25:34.370
Yes, it never hurts to ask questions, right?

00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:37.534
You know, we had the haunting investigation.

00:25:37.694 --> 00:25:40.917
Or maybe there is a couple other investigations going down, huh?

00:25:40.937 --> 00:25:44.321
Case solved.

00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:44.902
Case closed.

00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:47.627
BAU BAU!

00:25:47.727 --> 00:25:49.368
Ruffians!

00:25:49.488 --> 00:25:53.730
As you might know, just yesterday... Was it yesterday?

00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:10.003
A day ago, some time ago.

00:26:10.124 --> 00:26:10.884
Time!

00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:16.351
At the end of the month, we said goodbye to our most favorite place ever.

00:26:16.811 --> 00:26:19.614
Akihabara MisDo.

00:26:19.634 --> 00:26:22.157
BAU BAU!

00:26:22.177 --> 00:26:28.625
We are really happy that we could be able to say goodbye all together with you, Ruffians.

00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:31.366
It was really, really special to us.

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:32.807
Really important.

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:35.788
That we could kind of have this moment to say goodbye.

00:26:35.848 --> 00:26:37.829
Yeah, be able to spend the time, you know.

00:26:38.189 --> 00:26:40.831
The last hour that Akihabara Mizuho was open.

00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:42.211
Yeah, you know.

00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:45.713
But we wanted to say a big thank you to the super fans!

00:26:45.753 --> 00:26:48.354
You're super standing back up here!

00:26:48.614 --> 00:26:53.457
Right in front of the window on the second floor overlooking Akihabara's main street.

00:26:53.477 --> 00:26:54.117
It's perfect.

00:26:54.277 --> 00:26:57.382
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:26:57.522 --> 00:26:59.165
Have a howl of a day!

00:27:08.173 --> 00:27:18.358
It's still really hard for us, you know, we're trying our best to hold back our tears too, but just thank you Ruffians for being there with us during that moment.

00:27:18.778 --> 00:27:29.923
And you know, also to all the Ruffians that were able to visit, you know, have pon-de-ring dinner over at Akihabara just cause we have many many times before.

00:27:30.423 --> 00:27:33.124
It really meant so much to us, so thank you Ruffians.

00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:41.982
And also a big, big thank you to Akihabara for being such a special place to us.

00:27:42.582 --> 00:27:46.205
And for all of Akihabara for 52 years.

00:27:46.866 --> 00:27:49.308
BAU BAU!

00:27:50.409 --> 00:27:51.530
It was very special.

00:27:53.623 --> 00:27:59.605
There's other locations too, so for any love fans that are like, no I didn't get to eat a pon-de-ring, no!

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:00.306
You still can!

00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:03.747
It's just one location in a chain store, that's it.

00:28:03.867 --> 00:28:04.727
That's it.

00:28:04.887 --> 00:28:06.948
Yeah, but it was very special.

00:28:07.228 --> 00:28:07.888
Very special.

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:09.129
Very place, yes.

00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:15.015
BAU BAU!

00:28:15.035 --> 00:28:22.938
Today is also a day where we got to say a little bit of a... See you soon!

00:28:22.958 --> 00:28:31.682
In case you didn't know, today is the last day before FUWAMOCO Morning goes into a bit of a hibernation period.

00:28:33.582 --> 00:28:44.947
It'll be back soon, but the reason why it's going into hibernation is so that we can focus more on our health and other exciting things to do!

00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:50.749
In case you didn't know, Ruffians, it was busy when we debuted.

00:28:51.069 --> 00:28:58.952
But since then, it's been less and less and less and less sleep.

00:29:00.312 --> 00:29:00.893
I know.

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:06.018
If we continue like this, there's probably not going to be any sleep soon.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:13.326
So today is going to be the last episode of FUWAMOCO Morning for 2024!

00:29:14.087 --> 00:29:15.329
But Ruffians!

00:29:15.709 --> 00:29:17.631
You know... Oh that's great!

00:29:17.691 --> 00:29:20.855
Now I don't need to wake up early to go back to sleep!

00:29:21.115 --> 00:29:21.476
No!

00:29:22.056 --> 00:29:23.898
No, no, no, Ruffians!

00:29:24.038 --> 00:29:27.140
No, you just can't do that, you know!

00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:31.444
We have some do's and don'ts for you, okay?

00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:33.986
Do wake up early!

00:29:34.247 --> 00:29:35.908
You know, early in the morning!

00:29:35.988 --> 00:29:36.368
Yes!

00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:37.529
Don't go back to sleep!

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:38.030
No!

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:38.090
Do!

00:29:39.491 --> 00:29:41.073
Keep your schedule!

00:29:41.093 --> 00:29:43.735
Keep your schedule, Ruffians!

00:29:44.176 --> 00:29:45.858
You always wake up early.

00:29:45.878 --> 00:29:47.319
Why are you making that face, huh?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.802
Why are you making that face, huh?

00:29:50.262 --> 00:29:55.407
Go on walks, okay, Ruffians?

00:29:55.447 --> 00:29:58.451
Sleep is good, but it means you have to go to sleep earlier and then wake up.

00:29:58.771 --> 00:30:01.614
Go to sleep early and wake up early.

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:10.480
And you know, let us know how your work went using the hashtag #FWMCMORNING.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.742
What was your best shot from that work, you know?

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.752
You know, we still want you starting your day off on the right paw.

00:30:19.772 --> 00:30:26.996
So, you know, continue all these great habits you've made together with us here, okay, Ruffians?

00:30:27.076 --> 00:30:34.679
You know, and maybe if you're feeling a little bit lonely like, ah, today's another morning, but FUWAMOCO's not here and it's a Wednesday!

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:40.342
You know, why don't you check out maybe some of the past FUWAMOCO Mornings?

00:30:40.362 --> 00:30:40.862
You know!

00:30:41.402 --> 00:30:43.223
There's 140 of them.

00:30:43.323 --> 00:30:47.285
I'm sure there's probably at least a couple that you haven't been able to check out.

00:30:47.305 --> 00:30:47.906
Right, right.

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.466
But maybe you've already forgotten.

00:30:49.486 --> 00:30:53.449
Well, well being.

00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:59.932
We hope that you know you'll still have a very special part of your day ready for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:31:00.472 --> 00:31:09.737
And that you know, you know that we're always here protecting your smile and we're gonna do our best at all the things we have planned for you!

00:31:09.777 --> 00:31:10.618
So, bye!

00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:16.843
Don't call this the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:31:16.903 --> 00:31:18.925
It's not the last FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:19.486
Okay, okay.

00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:20.627
We're back!

00:31:20.687 --> 00:31:21.828
Look at the picture here.

00:31:21.928 --> 00:31:22.488
It says back.

00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:25.611
March 10th at 8am.

00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:27.693
PT information.

00:31:28.074 --> 00:31:28.454
Yeah.

00:31:28.494 --> 00:31:29.155
Right there.

00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:30.796
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:30.896 --> 00:31:31.437
FUWAMOCO!

00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:33.238
We are not going on hiatus!

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:33.939
No!

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:34.800
What the heck!

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.280
No!

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.362
We will still be streaming!

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:38.063
Yes!

00:31:38.383 --> 00:31:39.744
Multiple times a week!

00:31:40.605 --> 00:31:45.530
If you say those things, we're basically gonna track you down, okay?

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.772
We're working even harder than ever, okay?

00:31:47.952 --> 00:31:49.614
It's not a break!

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.595
It's not a break!

00:31:51.696 --> 00:31:53.557
It's just a hibernation, you know?

00:31:53.998 --> 00:31:55.959
Just like the bear goes to hibernate, you know?

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.960
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:31:57.361 --> 00:32:02.145
It might look like sleep, it might look like a break, but he's working hard, he's hibernating!

00:32:03.106 --> 00:32:04.748
That would be nice, huh?

00:32:07.482 --> 00:32:10.243
Because hibernation FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:12.063
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:13.104
Not FUWAMOCO.

00:32:13.484 --> 00:32:13.684
No.

00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:14.124
No.

00:32:14.744 --> 00:32:15.004
Yeah.

00:32:15.164 --> 00:32:15.624
Got it.

00:32:16.164 --> 00:32:17.505
Got it, Ruffians.

00:32:18.245 --> 00:32:19.585
No misunderstanding!

00:32:19.745 --> 00:32:21.646
Oh, I'll just make this my misunderstanding.

00:32:22.026 --> 00:32:22.506
No.

00:32:22.746 --> 00:32:22.966
No!

00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:23.146
No.

00:32:23.206 --> 00:32:23.466
No.

00:32:23.506 --> 00:32:24.166
Kill Ruffians!

00:32:24.226 --> 00:32:24.727
Got it!

00:32:25.327 --> 00:32:27.127
Otherwise we're gonna have to track you down.

00:32:28.087 --> 00:32:28.728
You wouldn't want that!

00:32:28.768 --> 00:32:30.348
Put it in the closet when I come out.

00:32:30.368 --> 00:32:30.408
No!

00:32:31.447 --> 00:32:31.747
BAU BAU!

00:32:31.787 --> 00:32:36.028
We'll see you again soon, Ruffians!

00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:38.629
On March 10th at 8am PT.

00:32:38.649 --> 00:32:42.410
It's not a break.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.591
BAU BAU!

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:58.534
Well, Ruffians, you know... It's gonna be a little while until the next FUWAMOCO Morning, so... We wanted to share something extra special with you today.

00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:00.035
Is that okay?

00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:07.759
We have a little bit of a letter for you today!

00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:09.320
We wanted to say something.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.880
We know.

00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:21.204
Since this is the last FUWAMOCO Morning until 2025, we wanted to let you know just how important FUWAMOCO Morning has been to us.

00:33:21.304 --> 00:33:29.207
You know, FUWAMOCO Morning has been a very special stream that we've been continuing three times a week since we debuted!

00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:31.328
With only a few missed episodes, you know,

00:33:32.378 --> 00:33:39.781
Having yakiniku with Suisei-senpai or you know, being too close to one million is heroic!

00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:42.742
When we were moving to Japan, stuff like that.

00:33:42.982 --> 00:33:43.962
Right?

00:33:44.062 --> 00:33:49.824
And it's meant so so much to us to be able to start our day together with you!

00:33:49.864 --> 00:33:54.606
And to know that we can send you off on the right paw, the best paw!

00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:57.787
No matter how hard your day was gonna

00:33:58.574 --> 00:33:59.234
Maybe B?

00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:00.195
I love B!

00:34:00.275 --> 00:34:02.756
Yeah, that's what we always wanted, you know?

00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:13.883
So, you know, for it to go into hibernation like this, and not be able to have that time with you, it's a really hard decision for us.

00:34:15.024 --> 00:34:20.866
You know, we don't really want that too, but sometimes hard decisions need to be made, you know?

00:34:21.847 --> 00:34:22.127
But!

00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:28.169
Despite that, we'll make sure that we're our best selves!

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:31.151
We'll remember what's important!

00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:39.374
We'll work hard even if it means that we won't be able to see your sleepy face as you're just getting up three times a week.

00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:40.634
For just a little bit.

00:34:40.794 --> 00:34:42.035
For a little bit, okay?

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:44.516
Just a little bit, okay?

00:34:44.736 --> 00:34:46.917
You know, BAU time is rough.

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:50.958
So, we'll be back here again really, really soon!

00:34:51.078 --> 00:34:53.099
Before you know it, Ruffians!

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:58.201
Yeah, so we'll see you again on March 10th at 8AM PT, okay?

00:34:58.261 --> 00:34:59.441
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:34:59.481 --> 00:34:59.862
BAU BAU!

00:35:03.543 --> 00:35:05.325
Thank you Ruffians!

00:35:06.005 --> 00:35:14.713
We will go over our schedule very soon because you will be seeing us in only a few hours from now.

00:35:15.153 --> 00:35:16.274
But before that!

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:18.736
We have the Doggie of the Day!

00:35:19.157 --> 00:35:21.639
Let's check out our Doggie of the Day!

00:35:21.659 --> 00:35:23.861
This Doggie of the Day is... Delphine!

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.725
BAU BAU!

00:35:28.765 --> 00:35:29.866
I'm so happy!

00:35:29.947 --> 00:35:32.669
Look at that big smile!

00:35:32.709 --> 00:35:33.330
Yeah, I know!

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.033
I'd be so happy to be there by your side!

00:35:36.053 --> 00:35:38.035
She looks so sweet!

00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:40.798
I'm gonna get some head pats.

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.141
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:35:57.983 --> 00:36:02.426
She's powerful.

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.827
Powered by sweetness.

00:36:05.668 --> 00:36:12.432
And I can see just how incredibly happy she is to be a part of your family.

00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:16.534
You know the BAU BAU wants to walk together with you.

00:36:17.315 --> 00:36:19.656
Take some coffee naps right beside you too.

00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:21.717
She never invades your personal space.

00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:22.578
No!

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:32.362
But, as for if she's fluffy or fuzzy, I would say fluffy.

00:36:32.962 --> 00:36:34.782
She's fuzzy!

00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:35.983
Kind of fuzzy.

00:36:36.103 --> 00:36:36.603
Fuzzy.

00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:37.943
Fluffy and fuzzy.

00:36:38.243 --> 00:36:41.024
Yeah, a bit of both.

00:36:41.084 --> 00:36:44.724
BAU BAU!

00:36:45.324 --> 00:36:47.165
Wow, next Ruffian!

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:50.249
This is only one of your walks.

00:36:50.369 --> 00:36:52.693
I'm expecting lots more walks soon!

00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:52.793
Okay!

00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:54.275
Well, let's check out your walk.

00:36:54.495 --> 00:36:55.056
Hi!

00:36:55.617 --> 00:36:57.239
On today, I went on a walk.

00:36:57.259 --> 00:36:58.120
We have!

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.663
De-den!

00:36:59.963 --> 00:37:02.487
FUWAMOCO!

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:04.940
So many flowers!

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.700
Two loops!

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.182
I stopped because I didn't want to be with so many flowers!

00:37:09.282 --> 00:37:13.604
I stopped because I was trying to think of what kind of flowers it is.

00:37:13.624 --> 00:37:17.406
This is a little white back car.

00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:18.207
It's so pretty!

00:37:18.247 --> 00:37:18.967
Two loops high!

00:37:19.928 --> 00:37:27.212
Oh my gosh, look at the sun rays there.

00:37:27.252 --> 00:37:30.894
The sky, the mountains, all the colors.

00:37:31.174 --> 00:37:31.594
Beautiful.

00:37:32.158 --> 00:37:33.958
The smell!

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:41.040
But, Ruffians, you know, it's really really important to go outside and explore.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.960
Even if you know, you're like, well there's no tulips on the way, I'm gonna walk around.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.561
You never know there might be at least one, or even something more beautiful.

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:54.962
You know, if you don't go out and explore, you know, you might miss some amazing things.

00:37:54.982 --> 00:37:57.703
You know, beautiful sights, maybe opportunities too!

00:37:57.743 --> 00:37:59.323
You don't even know what you're missing!

00:38:00.446 --> 00:38:10.269
You know, there really are only so many seasons you can enjoy, so we really hope that you'll continue to take walks, okay, Ruffians?

00:38:10.629 --> 00:38:12.369
Especially because it's chilly now.

00:38:12.769 --> 00:38:13.930
But make sure you're warm.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.630
Got it?

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.751
BAU BAU!

00:38:19.071 --> 00:38:22.212
You're gonna use this Ruffian's walk as a wallpaper?

00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:25.070
I guess that makes sense.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.631
It's so beautiful.

00:38:26.691 --> 00:38:28.832
BAU BAU!

00:38:28.892 --> 00:38:32.774
Next we have a Question of the Day.

00:38:32.794 --> 00:38:35.856
We have De-den!

00:38:36.136 --> 00:38:38.657
Good morning FUWAMOCO!

00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:41.419
FUWAMOCO Morning is going into hibernation.

00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:48.483
But do you have any tips or advices to help us start our day off on the right paw until it's back?

00:38:48.883 --> 00:38:51.525
Maybe something you do in your morning routine?

00:38:51.825 --> 00:38:54.806
Looking forward to sharing more mornings together in March.

00:38:55.287 --> 00:38:56.968
BAU BAU!

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.992
It's really important to have Ruffians.

00:39:04.012 --> 00:39:10.155
You know, I feel like you can get so much done if you just go, well, this is what I do every day at this time.

00:39:10.175 --> 00:39:11.036
Yeah.

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:12.997
It's really important.

00:39:13.197 --> 00:39:18.861
So if you put something on the, I don't want to do that, in the morning routine, then suddenly, you know, it's done.

00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:19.761
Stretches, right?

00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:21.622
Stretches are so important.

00:39:21.682 --> 00:39:22.423
Ruffians!

00:39:22.523 --> 00:39:25.945
Have you thought of the last time you stretched?

00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:28.306
Not just like stretched like in your chair.

00:39:28.326 --> 00:39:30.348
That doesn't count.

00:39:30.448 --> 00:39:30.588
No.

00:39:32.055 --> 00:39:33.416
Go on the floor!

00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:35.058
Or on your bed!

00:39:35.098 --> 00:39:35.918
Five years ago!

00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:43.618
I think it's time.

00:39:44.038 --> 00:39:44.398
Right?

00:39:44.558 --> 00:39:46.419
I think it's time, Robin!

00:39:46.819 --> 00:39:47.619
You can do it!

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:48.019
Yeah!

00:39:48.039 --> 00:39:50.859
You can get the extreme stretches in there!

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.140
Yes!

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.280
And then you know the morning routine too.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.401
You can start your day off on the right paw.

00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:01.862
I know, but things you know like getting a comfy sleep.

00:40:02.222 --> 00:40:03.122
Healthy breakfast.

00:40:03.162 --> 00:40:03.362
Yes!

00:40:03.482 --> 00:40:05.482
It's very easy and very important.

00:40:05.602 --> 00:40:09.583
I see a lot of people being like, oh but if I eat breakfast in the morning I feel nauseous.

00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:14.134
That's because you're not eating breakfast.

00:40:14.534 --> 00:40:22.556
You know, just making yourself the best version of you before you head out is the best thing you can do, I think, you know?

00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:25.917
Prepare yourself in so many ways for your day!

00:40:26.517 --> 00:40:27.917
Miko, you can do it, okay?

00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:29.938
We'll feel you!

00:40:29.978 --> 00:40:33.039
Miko's proud, okay?

00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:34.519
Even more proud!

00:40:34.539 --> 00:40:35.999
Even more proud, okay?

00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:37.220
BAU BAU!

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:46.103
Thank you so so much for always being such a special part of FUWAMOCO Morning here with us, Ruffians!

00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:53.806
I know like we mentioned, FUWAMOCO Morning is going to be heading into a hibernation period until it's back, March 10th at 8AM PT!

00:40:55.487 --> 00:40:56.668
We're not going anywhere!

00:40:57.848 --> 00:40:58.888
Okay, Ruffians.

00:40:59.329 --> 00:41:01.209
Thank you so so much.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.271
We'll still be looking at the hashtag!

00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:07.372
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

00:41:07.752 --> 00:41:19.357
So please send us your submissions, you know, the vlogs that you go on, any cute dogs you might see, and maybe any sightings of Pero you happen upon to your baby.

00:41:20.923 --> 00:41:22.064
BAU BAU!

00:41:22.124 --> 00:41:26.307
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:41:26.627 --> 00:41:28.088
Let's take a look at our schedule here.

00:41:28.128 --> 00:41:30.409
Yeah, our schedule!

00:41:30.489 --> 00:41:31.570
Actually, wait wait wait.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.072
It's not exactly our next stream, but...

00:41:35.273 --> 00:41:42.520
We will have it on our next schedule but we are still gonna be doing our 3D trick-or-treating

00:42:01.189 --> 00:42:06.473
And we would like you to join us for Trick-or-Treat in November again.

00:42:06.613 --> 00:42:11.797
Stay tuned for more FUWAMOCO!

00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:14.980
BAU BAU!

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.585
I can't keep the Ruffians up past midnight and then ask you to wake up at 8am.

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:23.027
We're thinking about you, okay?

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:23.447
That's why!

00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:52.490
For the schedule. Our next stream coming up at 6pm PT today. We're gonna be playing some Donkey Kong Country. It's been a long time. I'm really looking forward to getting back into it. To jumping over this over that and screaming a bunch too. So please join us for the chaos, Ruffians. And then on Saturday we're gonna be back to some Minecraft.

00:42:52.571 --> 00:42:57.733
It's been a little while, but it's just me, Moco-chan, and I, and you!

00:42:58.013 --> 00:43:01.174
Exploring Minecraft, learning all about Minecraft together.

00:43:01.194 --> 00:43:03.635
So we hope to see you there, Ruffians!

00:43:03.695 --> 00:43:05.696
Yeah, try to find Fuwawa's buried treasure.

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:05.916
Yeah.

00:43:05.996 --> 00:43:08.157
Remember that in your own heart.

00:43:08.937 --> 00:43:11.079

00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:18.545

Thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.742
It'll be a little while until we spend our next morning together.

00:43:43.223 --> 00:43:45.384
But we'll be back really soon, okay?

00:43:45.444 --> 00:43:46.525
Before you know it!

00:43:46.585 --> 00:43:54.169
Before we say BAU BAU for now, I'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!
