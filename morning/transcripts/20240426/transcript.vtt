08:59.113 --> 09:01.874
Thank you very much!

09:02.074 --> 09:05.175
I have some bad news.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.616
No, no, no bad news, no.

09:07.776 --> 09:08.557
No bad news.

09:08.597 --> 09:08.857
Why?

09:09.957 --> 09:13.758
There's been another peron sighting!

09:13.959 --> 09:14.579
Slow pain?

09:15.599 --> 09:18.722
Pero's nasty.

09:19.163 --> 09:20.304
Pero's nasty.

09:36.279 --> 09:37.740
Pero, Koyori, BAU BAU?

09:37.840 --> 09:38.640
Is Pero scared?

09:38.900 --> 09:41.301
Maybe Koyori-senpai is BAU BAUing.

09:41.321 --> 09:43.202
Pero is running away.

09:43.222 --> 09:45.663
Koyori-senpai is a coyote.

09:45.703 --> 09:48.604
Maybe Pero will run away from Koyori-senpai.

09:48.644 --> 09:50.104
Let's see where Pero is.

09:50.504 --> 09:51.685
Let's see where Pero is.

09:51.705 --> 09:52.105
De-den!

10:01.629 --> 10:02.550
Cute!

10:02.590 --> 10:03.270
Cute Pero!

10:03.411 --> 10:04.111
Cute Pero!

10:04.611 --> 10:04.752
Cute!

10:05.072 --> 10:13.799
Well, you know, I think maybe this ruffian thought they were gonna have a nice cappuccino, but... No.

10:14.099 --> 10:15.020
It was Pero!

10:18.881 --> 10:27.945
I don't know how I feel if this was the drink I received, but the barista probably put a lot of their heart and soul into it, but I don't know.

10:28.005 --> 10:33.187
I feel like something kind of nasty got accidentally added to this drink.

10:34.408 --> 10:36.408
But Koyori-senpai!

10:36.729 --> 10:38.149
Do you like cappuccino?

10:38.229 --> 10:40.970
Do you like cappuccino?

10:40.990 --> 10:42.571
I love cappuccino.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.913
Cappuccino!

10:45.933 --> 10:46.933

10:47.073 --> 10:47.874

11:10.787 --> 11:13.369
I want to do a lemon mibare.

11:13.609 --> 11:13.989
Afraid.

11:30.862 --> 11:34.705
I want Koyori-senpai's design on my cappuccino then.

11:34.745 --> 11:37.087
Moco-chan, you wanna be BAU BAU?

11:37.187 --> 11:37.327
Okay.

12:03.186 --> 12:09.368
BAU BAU!

12:09.769 --> 12:16.031
Maybe this cappuccino, this peroncino, maybe this is the good kind of peroncino.

12:16.051 --> 12:16.331
BAU BAU!

12:26.995 --> 12:27.915
Yeah!

12:28.356 --> 12:34.298
Well, since Koyori-senpai is our guest today, we had a question for her.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.918
Right, Moco-chan?

12:36.519 --> 12:37.479
A question?

12:37.499 --> 12:37.999
Yeah!

12:38.279 --> 12:53.024
Well, FUWAMOCO, you know that we're kind of picky eaters, and we don't like tomatoes, and we don't like onions, and that kind of goes for mayonnaise too.

12:53.044 --> 12:53.085
Oh!

12:53.105 --> 12:54.185

12:54.825 --> 12:55.046

Mayonnaise

13:22.449 --> 13:23.790
Beginner?

13:23.830 --> 13:26.731
Beginner is first mayonnaise.

13:27.952 --> 13:31.994
Curry rice with mayonnaise.

13:32.074 --> 13:34.095
Have you tried it?

13:34.395 --> 13:35.936
No, we haven't tried it.

13:38.437 --> 13:49.525
I thought you know sometimes people put on their curry rice teriyaki sauce.

13:51.106 --> 13:57.310
I thought they had it at other places, but maybe not.

13:57.330 --> 14:01.413
But the stores, they don't have mayonnaise.

14:08.436 --> 14:10.777
Do you bring your own mayo to the restaurant?

14:11.597 --> 14:13.939
I am a childhood.

14:14.579 --> 14:16.100
Childhood?

14:16.140 --> 14:17.300
Childhood.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.481
When you were a child.

14:18.981 --> 14:20.001
When you were a child.

14:20.662 --> 14:21.422
Yeah.

14:21.662 --> 14:23.003
Mochiaruiteta.

14:23.803 --> 14:24.483
I give up.

14:24.523 --> 14:24.824
Give up?

14:25.024 --> 14:25.684
You got it.

14:25.764 --> 14:26.644
You got it.

14:26.784 --> 14:27.665
I eat mayonnaise.

14:28.105 --> 14:29.966
But mayonnaise.

14:30.346 --> 14:31.887
Mochiaruku.

14:32.027 --> 14:33.107
I take mayonnaise.

14:33.167 --> 14:35.328
Yeah, take it.

14:35.448 --> 14:36.529
Kusarisou.

14:37.562 --> 14:38.804
Oh, it goes back.

14:38.884 --> 14:39.785
That's my Insta.

14:39.865 --> 14:40.826
Hey, Mayonnaise Bridge!

14:59.887 --> 15:01.968
Did they bring you mayonnaise?

15:02.268 --> 15:02.988
Staff-san.

15:03.028 --> 15:03.469
Yes, yes, yes!

15:03.489 --> 15:03.969
Mayonnaise!

15:04.049 --> 15:04.589
Is this it?

15:04.629 --> 15:05.069
Yes!

15:05.129 --> 15:09.472
Mayonnaise is a must item.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.553
That's a must item.

15:10.633 --> 15:11.313
Like ketchup!

15:12.334 --> 15:13.394
In Japanese.

15:26.024 --> 15:30.909
By the way, Koyori-senpai, do you like ketchup?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.813
Ketchup, I like.

15:34.933 --> 15:42.101
But the one you put on ketchup, I usually put mayonnaise on it.

15:42.301 --> 15:42.821
I see.

15:42.861 --> 15:47.006
So instead of using ketchup, Koyori-senpai, you use mayonnaise.

15:47.966 --> 15:48.686
Omurice.

15:48.786 --> 15:50.747
Potato fries.

15:51.027 --> 15:53.348
Fries too and omurice.

15:54.648 --> 15:56.028
All mayonnaise.

15:56.328 --> 15:57.349
Wow!

15:57.749 --> 15:59.169
Can you imagine?

15:59.329 --> 16:02.330
If we have ponzu mix and mayonnaise!

16:02.370 --> 16:03.130
Ponzu mix!

16:03.170 --> 16:04.491
Mayonnaise!

16:06.551 --> 16:07.872
Pondering!

16:07.912 --> 16:11.454
No, no, not with mayonnaise.

16:11.494 --> 16:12.595
But delicious.

16:12.795 --> 16:12.975
Right?

16:12.995 --> 16:13.596
Delicious?

16:13.936 --> 16:14.836
Yeah.

16:14.977 --> 16:16.017
I sort of want to try now.

16:16.377 --> 16:18.639
I want to try pondering and mayonnaise.

16:18.719 --> 16:20.980
I want to try pondering and curry.

16:21.220 --> 16:24.002
Pondering and curry!

16:24.182 --> 16:26.223
Pondering and curry!

16:26.383 --> 16:28.185
Pondering is a bit like rice.

16:32.581 --> 16:35.163
I have another question.

16:35.183 --> 16:42.169
Koyori-senpai, you said you were worried about it going bad.

16:50.855 --> 16:52.477
Does Japanese mayo go bad?

16:52.677 --> 16:58.603
I heard that in Japan, you don't need to put mayonnaise in the fridge.

17:08.297 --> 17:09.298
Not in the fridge.

17:09.598 --> 17:10.578
Not in the fridge.

17:10.658 --> 17:13.060
OK, but summer is too hot in Japan.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.040
That makes sense.

17:14.300 --> 17:14.640
I see.

17:14.840 --> 17:16.761
In winter it's OK.

17:16.882 --> 17:17.582
OK, OK, OK.

17:25.786 --> 17:37.577
Thank you, Koyori-senpai, for your mayonnaise wisdom!

17:37.897 --> 17:39.338
I want to eat mayo now.

17:39.358 --> 17:39.719
Drink!

17:39.779 --> 17:40.119
Drink!

17:40.579 --> 17:41.600
Drink mayo!

17:41.700 --> 17:44.022
Mayonnaise is drinking!

17:44.182 --> 17:45.063
It's a drink?

17:45.323 --> 17:47.445
Okay.

17:47.826 --> 17:50.068
Mayo choo-choo!

17:50.108 --> 17:52.089
Giving kisses to the mayonnaise too!

17:53.900 --> 17:57.885
Okay, today's FUWAMOCO your morning has mayonnaise kisses.

17:57.985 --> 17:58.946
Okay?

17:59.267 --> 18:00.528
Mayonnaise kisses!

18:12.161 --> 18:15.822
BAU BAU!

18:16.542 --> 18:21.084
We also had a question.

18:22.024 --> 18:23.604
Koyori-senpai.

18:24.524 --> 18:26.685
Why is today not a sleepover?

18:26.765 --> 18:28.786
Why is there no youbai party?

18:29.486 --> 18:30.026
Good.

18:30.046 --> 18:31.706
Why isn't there a sleepover?

18:31.726 --> 18:35.567
Why isn't there a youbai party?

18:35.587 --> 18:37.448
We had that question.

18:38.808 --> 18:39.949
I don't have bed.

18:40.009 --> 18:41.369
I have only single bed.

18:54.154 --> 19:01.159
Ah, then FUWAMOCO will use your bed and Koyori-senpai can sleep on the ground.

19:01.179 --> 19:07.164
FUWAMOCO will sleep in Koyori-senpai's single bed, but Koyori-senpai will sleep under her bed.

19:07.204 --> 19:09.085
That's fine, because she's a dog!

19:09.245 --> 19:12.768
No, no, no, no, no!

19:12.868 --> 19:14.549
Boss dog!

19:14.729 --> 19:16.250
You are a dog too!

19:16.671 --> 19:17.871
We're dogs too, but...

19:19.232 --> 19:20.253
No, no, no, no, no!

19:20.273 --> 19:20.313
No!

19:20.553 --> 19:20.653
No!

19:20.673 --> 19:20.793
Kaere!

19:37.451 --> 19:42.453
I want to give to Pajama Advent members.

19:42.693 --> 19:43.714
All members!

19:57.619 --> 20:02.501
So then the Yobai Party will have to wait until all of Advent's here!

20:03.042 --> 20:06.704
And then Koyori-senpai will have special pajamas for us!

20:10.146 --> 20:13.428
Well, we'll have to hope they're not yabai pajamas.

20:13.468 --> 20:16.269
Yabai pajamas for the Yobai Party.

20:16.449 --> 20:21.512
The pajamas Koyori-senpai will be giving away aren't yabai pajamas, right?

20:25.220 --> 20:27.162
I'm not sexy!

20:27.262 --> 20:28.623
I'm Fuwawa!

20:28.703 --> 20:30.845
Are you sure about that?

20:31.265 --> 20:35.789
Are you sure you wanna be saying that?

20:49.588 --> 20:51.490
Is this a question to ask us?

20:51.610 --> 20:54.472
Doggy Pack!

20:54.952 --> 20:57.774
How is it?

20:57.834 --> 21:02.337
How is it?

21:02.437 --> 21:06.660
Maybe that will have to wait until the Yobai Party with Advent.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.202
Is it a secret until the Yobai Party?

21:09.222 --> 21:09.462
Secret!

21:09.502 --> 21:10.683
Look forward to it!

21:10.703 --> 21:12.825
Look forward to it!

21:12.865 --> 21:15.086
Look forward to it!

21:15.106 --> 21:15.567
BAU means...

21:16.567 --> 21:22.269
It's being so kind to give us a gift and think of all us.

21:22.589 --> 21:23.729
I guess anything goes.

21:44.514 --> 21:45.115
BAU BAU!

21:45.155 --> 21:47.357
We're looking forward to it!

22:02.370 --> 22:07.077
BAU BAU!

22:07.398 --> 22:07.938
Next!

22:08.700 --> 22:10.562
Konyoni-senpai!

22:10.803 --> 22:13.767
You have something special that you'd like to share today.

22:18.033 --> 22:24.514
Koyori-senpai has a new recent original song, Tear Gazer!

22:24.534 --> 22:31.456
Can you talk about your original song, Koyori-senpai?

22:43.038 --> 22:48.239
Okay, so my first maid word.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.840
Koyori-senpai, you wrote it yourself?

22:50.920 --> 22:51.420
The lyrics?

22:51.540 --> 22:52.000
Yes, yes.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.081
Koyo's heart.

23:02.273 --> 23:18.225
It's a song that Koyori-senpai wrote the lyrics for.

23:18.505 --> 23:25.231
You know, for times where it's kind of rough and you just don't have the energy or you just don't quite have that pump in your step.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.592
To give you that extra push.

23:26.652 --> 23:26.932
Yeah.

23:27.272 --> 23:30.835
And so that you can listen to it and- It has all her feelings and heart in it.

23:31.195 --> 23:31.655
Question!

23:47.123 --> 23:50.888
Zettai Akiramenai is English.

23:51.428 --> 23:52.450
Never give up!

23:52.510 --> 23:53.271
Never give up!

23:53.351 --> 23:56.354
Never give up song!

23:56.514 --> 23:57.996
Never give up song!

23:58.096 --> 23:59.298
Never give up!

23:59.318 --> 24:00.119
Never give up!

24:00.179 --> 24:00.860
Never give up!

24:04.464 --> 24:06.445
BAU BAU BAU!

24:06.645 --> 24:09.288
Dogs are stubborn, aren't they?

24:09.308 --> 24:12.610
That's why they never give up.

24:12.770 --> 24:17.094
Us dogs, canine family, we're stubborn!

24:17.114 --> 24:18.235
We're hungry!

24:18.495 --> 24:20.317
If we wanna bite you, we'll bite you!

24:20.337 --> 24:20.457
Bite!

24:20.477 --> 24:20.777
Bite you?

24:20.817 --> 24:20.957
Bite!

24:20.997 --> 24:21.738
Bite you?

24:21.878 --> 24:24.780
Because we're hungry, we'll bite you!

24:24.800 --> 24:25.581
Bite you!

24:32.206 --> 24:36.947
Please check it out when you know maybe you're feeling a little bit like it's been a rough day.

24:37.028 --> 24:41.369
Koyori-senpai will be there to show you it's okay.

24:41.929 --> 24:45.851
Please listen to Tear Gazer, Koyori-senpai's original song.

24:46.271 --> 24:50.653
Thank you!

24:50.673 --> 24:50.953
BAU BAU!

24:50.973 --> 24:51.173
Wow.

24:54.932 --> 24:58.455
Koyori-senpai, you have Asakoya, your morning show.

24:59.075 --> 25:05.600
And so, we wanted to take a page out of Asakoya's book and share a serifu.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.943
Yeah, Asakoya lines.

25:17.169 --> 25:25.094
Today's FUWAMOCO lines.

25:25.414 --> 25:28.016
The first, and hopefully not the last.

25:28.036 --> 25:32.058

25:36.494 --> 25:38.575

25:39.215 --> 25:41.516
Would you like Mococo?

25:41.956 --> 25:46.278
Would you like Koyori?

25:47.558 --> 25:48.879

25:49.539 --> 25:52.540

Not coyori?

26:29.465 --> 26:29.685
What?

26:29.765 --> 26:30.125
No!

26:30.205 --> 26:32.568
FUWAMOCO-chan kasamaretai.

26:32.988 --> 26:35.552
Are you gonna be in between FUWAMOCO?

26:42.842 --> 26:44.223
No, you're a dog!

26:44.283 --> 26:46.304
You're a dog!

26:46.384 --> 26:49.745
No, you're a dog!

26:49.785 --> 26:51.206
You're a dog!

26:51.466 --> 26:54.407
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

26:55.448 --> 26:58.249
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

26:58.309 --> 27:02.951
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Mococo!

27:11.738 --> 27:13.840
Let's say it one more time.

27:13.860 --> 27:16.564
Koyori-senpai.

27:16.604 --> 27:21.509
What do you like about Fuwawa?

27:25.182 --> 27:26.083
What would you like?

27:26.103 --> 27:29.004

Thank you very much.

27:46.834 --> 27:47.455
No, thank you, Koyori-senpai!

27:47.475 --> 27:48.356
Let's take a look at our regular corners.

I'm kind of in the way here.

28:17.978 --> 28:21.059
But Moca, Moca's no longer a puppy.

28:21.400 --> 28:27.382
So now Moca is learning to become a pro Frisbee player together with the ruffians.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.023
So cute!

28:30.363 --> 28:33.685
Frisbee is also a way to become a pro.

28:33.805 --> 28:37.086
Right now they're training.

28:37.526 --> 28:38.787
Moca's doing their best.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.420
Her face is so serious!

28:43.600 --> 28:46.701
And her eyes are so cute!

28:46.761 --> 28:49.902
Cute little black eyes and a nose!

28:49.922 --> 28:52.582

29:39.651 --> 29:42.835
You know, you can tell Moca is doing their best.

29:43.195 --> 29:48.182
They want to win the competition, but you know, they're still just... just a little bit...

29:48.642 --> 29:53.704
I'm a puppy, so... Yeah, they're gonna do their best together with their ruffians!

29:54.124 --> 29:56.065
And let's all cheer on Moco!

29:56.085 --> 30:00.427
Hopefully one day we can see them win that frisbee competition!

30:00.447 --> 30:04.569
BAU BAU!

30:04.869 --> 30:05.069
Oh!

You know some, Fuwa!

30:12.358 --> 30:12.778
Oh!

A beach!

30:16.640 --> 30:17.941
You went to the beach with a friend!

Really cute!

30:26.566 --> 30:30.668
Koyari-senpai, do you like to go to the beach?

30:39.174 --> 30:42.174
I wanna see the cute girls in the beach.

30:42.214 --> 30:45.875

30:46.055 --> 30:47.515
Bikini girl is so good.

30:48.015 --> 30:48.655
So good!

30:48.755 --> 30:53.296
The sea is so hot.

30:53.576 --> 30:56.277
The beach is hot.

30:56.517 --> 30:59.938
Maybe we can go to the beach together one day.

31:00.078 --> 31:02.098

31:49.274 --> 31:52.136

31:53.517 --> 32:00.382

32:00.722 --> 32:03.525
Excuse my passion Japanese, I try my best.

32:03.945 --> 32:06.367
I'll do my best with passion Japanese.

32:06.547 --> 32:10.270
Konyari and FUWAMOCO often play together.

32:10.330 --> 32:13.393
Konyari, do you like FUWAMOCO?

32:15.534 --> 32:17.595
I don't want to choose.

32:17.675 --> 32:19.456
I can't choose.

32:19.476 --> 32:20.776
First love point.

32:38.476 --> 32:42.717

33:01.683 --> 33:02.683
Yes, right.

33:02.763 --> 33:03.944
Ganbarteru.

33:04.064 --> 33:04.864
Tottemo.

33:04.944 --> 33:06.565
Very very ganbaru.

33:08.391 --> 33:11.932
I see FUWAMOCO-chan.

33:12.792 --> 33:13.612
I do my best.

33:13.652 --> 33:14.253
Wow, thank you!

33:27.036 --> 33:32.898
Koyori-senpai sees FUWAMOCO doing her best and Koyori-senpai wants to wick her too.

33:33.258 --> 33:33.558
But!

33:33.958 --> 33:34.698
That's not fair!

33:34.758 --> 33:35.219
Zurui!

33:35.239 --> 33:35.679
FUWAMOCO mo!

33:35.699 --> 33:40.980
You wanted to say the FUWAMOCO no serifu datte!

33:41.300 --> 33:50.243
Koyori-senpai no ne, sugoi ganbatteiru tokoro mite, FUWAMOCO mo shikkari to ne, ganbaranai to na to omoimasu.

33:54.504 --> 33:55.765
What was that just now?

33:55.785 --> 33:57.366
It's like we're influencing each other.

33:57.406 --> 33:59.828
We're influencing each other.

33:59.848 --> 34:01.029
Dogs run in a pack!

34:01.069 --> 34:03.671
Dogs are happier when they have friends.

34:03.691 --> 34:05.932
I guess that's why.

34:17.961 --> 34:20.565
I think Fuwamoco-chan is my daughter.

34:35.601 --> 34:52.813
We'd like to say a big thank you to all the Ruffians and Chushu-kun today too!

34:53.173 --> 34:56.376
That, you know, shared the Doggie of the Day.

34:57.056 --> 34:58.477
That works, you know.

34:58.937 --> 35:10.442
And for all your questions too, FUWAMOCO Morning is something special we make all together with you and today with Koyori-chan.

35:10.502 --> 35:11.843
It means so much to us.

35:12.083 --> 35:15.845
Please, if you have any more submissions, let us know with the hashtag.

35:16.305 --> 35:18.086

35:23.508 --> 35:25.489

35:25.649 --> 35:26.289
Koyori-senpai!

35:26.389 --> 35:30.790
What are you doing for your next dream?

35:30.930 --> 35:34.311
After tomorrow, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

35:44.997 --> 35:46.878
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth?

35:46.919 --> 35:47.739

35:52.323 --> 35:53.123
Is it fun?

35:53.364 --> 35:54.725
Tanoshii desu ka?

35:55.265 --> 35:58.347
It is very very fun.

35:58.648 --> 36:01.250
Melting time.

36:03.290 --> 36:05.911
Time just disappears when you're having fun.

36:06.672 --> 36:08.832
I get it, yeah.

36:08.932 --> 36:10.313
Good games are good.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.634
Good luck with Final Fantasy 7.

36:15.354 --> 36:16.014
BAU BAU.

36:16.394 --> 36:19.975
FUWAMOCO Schedule!

36:20.416 --> 36:23.356
Moco-chan has kinda turned a bit into a frog.

36:23.777 --> 36:24.257
More than a dog.

36:25.257 --> 36:26.638
There might be some changes.

36:26.958 --> 36:34.023
There might be a few changes, but FUWAMOCO, we have the holo Dorokei 2024 event coming up.

36:34.283 --> 36:36.725
Koyori-senpai, you'll be there too, right?

36:37.065 --> 36:37.905
Yes!

36:38.306 --> 36:39.887
I am keisatsu.

36:40.167 --> 36:40.907
No, police!

36:41.087 --> 36:41.648
Policeman!

36:43.274 --> 36:45.375
You won't catch FUWAMOCO, right?

36:59.764 --> 37:02.465
So we'll be all practicing for that.

37:02.826 --> 37:04.286
So we hope you can catch it.

37:04.727 --> 37:07.208
And especially on the big day of hololive K-2024.

37:07.248 --> 37:07.428
BAU BAU!

37:07.448 --> 37:07.908
Thank you so much!

37:15.072 --> 37:17.373

37:17.714 --> 37:26.520

37:26.780 --> 37:27.161

37:27.661 --> 37:34.126
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our extra special Ruffians today!

37:34.386 --> 37:39.770
Koyurin-senpai, after FUWAMOCO Morning, you always say the name of the Ruffians.

37:39.810 --> 37:41.292
Can we do that together?

37:41.372 --> 37:41.492
Okay!

37:45.291 --> 37:45.951

37:45.991 --> 37:46.972
