00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.521
Hello, BAU BAU!

00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.483
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:21.206
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.007
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:24.407
Hi!

00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:27.709
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:30.691
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.452
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:34.373
BAU BAU!

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:40.237
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.697 --> 00:05:41.418
Ruffians!

00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:45.401
It's the end of the week!

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:49.564
And today also is our 108th episode!

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:53.607
Thank you for joining us!

00:05:53.627 --> 00:05:54.107
BAU BAU!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.948
Yeah, it's Friday!

00:05:56.068 --> 00:05:57.089
Friday time!

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.769
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:06.475
I actually just saw a Ruffian asking, what is this FUWAMOCO Morning?

00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:07.875
Wow!

00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:11.897
For Ruffians that are joining us for the first time!

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:18.100
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.841
A.K.A.

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:19.841
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.162
And it's hosted by us!

00:06:21.822 --> 00:06:23.183
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:29.125
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:31.346

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:38.869
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.390
BAU BAU!

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.833
There's so many exciting things going on this week at Ruffians!

00:06:47.613 --> 00:06:49.233
A lot of singing.

00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:51.614
Are you ready, Moco-chan?

00:06:51.634 --> 00:07:00.516
Well, you know with exciting stuff, there has to be a disappointing stuff.

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:02.677
No, there doesn't need to be.

00:07:02.717 --> 00:07:04.197
Wait, wait, wait, Ruffians.

00:07:04.777 --> 00:07:07.578
Let's get started with disappointing stuff.

00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:09.519
That's how we're gonna start our Friday.

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:15.020
There's been another Perroccino.

00:07:19.148 --> 00:07:19.930
I don't understand.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.279
I know Pero has his little wings and stuff, but... He travels around a lot.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.744
Yeah, how does he find so many Ruffians?

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:32.591
He has a knack for it, obviously.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:36.053
Where was Pero spotted this time?

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.014
Let's take a look.

00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:40.896
De-den!

00:07:41.737 --> 00:07:43.618
Pero's out in the wild now.

00:07:44.158 --> 00:07:48.901
You know, just the other day he was over in LA at Anime Expo.

00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:49.682
No bothering.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.984
Ruffians are trying to steal the show from us.

00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:53.684
But...

00:07:55.025 --> 00:08:00.229
Now he's bothering prairie dogs out in the countryside!

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:00.790
Ruffians.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.811
Prairie dogs.

00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:03.492
Pero.

00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:04.973
Prairie dogs.

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:07.895
I guess Pero's bigger than a prairie dog.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.957
Pero's not bigger than a Ruffian.

00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:11.298
Yeah.

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:12.619
Prairie dog.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.520
Pudding.

00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:15.905
This one is similar.

00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:20.752
You know, I guess he has to constantly be bothering somebody or something.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.298
Maybe it looks like the Ruffians are next.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:31.086
He's had his fill of the prairie dogs and now you're next Ruffian.

00:08:31.106 --> 00:08:33.369
The look in his eyes is really quite hot.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.190
Good luck, okay?

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.311
Good luck!

00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:38.053
In these situations, have friends.

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:39.835
Pudding will save you.

00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:41.276
It's your best friend, okay?

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:43.518
Always good to have some pudding with you, okay?

00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:43.878
Yeah.

00:08:44.018 --> 00:08:45.840
Also, you know, in case you get hungry too.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.200
Yeah.

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:48.302
BAU BAU!

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:49.503
BAU BAU!

00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:51.085
They became friends.

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:51.145
Ah!

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:52.906
Friends.

00:08:53.487 --> 00:08:54.568
Interesting way to put it.

00:08:54.728 --> 00:08:56.029
Yeah, that's the way to put it.

00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:57.090
You know, friends.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.773
My one friend ends up in the tummy.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.471
Strange.

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:03.951
Yeah.

00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:05.672
That was disappointing.

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:06.513
But!

00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:07.273
Yeah!

00:09:08.074 --> 00:09:09.254
Well, next thing wasn't disappointing.

00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:10.795
Isn't disappointing.

00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:11.596
Why?

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:14.517
It actually made me happy, Ruffians!

00:09:14.557 --> 00:09:15.238
Yeah!

00:09:15.398 --> 00:09:16.359
FUWAMOCO!

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:19.661
We hit another big milestone together!

00:09:19.721 --> 00:09:20.761
Yeah, yeah!

00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:21.322
Why?

00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:27.385
With FUWAMOCO, our cover of Kanae's Identity has hit 1 million views!

00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:27.785
Yeah!

00:09:27.845 --> 00:09:29.987
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.589
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:40.673
You've been listening to it lots and lots and just showing us how much you love our music!

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:42.414
Thank you!

00:09:42.454 --> 00:09:46.696
We're really so grateful to have a number of cover songs over 1 million.

00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:47.757
1 million!

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:48.838
That's so many!

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.640
It's absolutely amazing!

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.641
Thank you!

00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:53.943
I know!

00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:58.027
I hope I get to release a lot of new cover songs and music soon!

00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:01.430
So please look forward to it, okay?

00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:06.896
Yeah, I really- I just can't believe it's been so long since our last release now, Moco-chan.

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:13.402
You know, time flies just when you're so busy with a bunch of different things going on.

00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:15.204
Do you wanna hear more Ruffians?

00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:16.865
Arigatou!

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:20.108
Arigatou!

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:22.871
FUWAMOCO korekara ganbaru kara ne!

00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:24.933
What's the next one?

00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:27.876
That's what I wanna do too, Ruffians!

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:29.457
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:31.199
BAU BAU!

00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:32.200
Of course!

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.691
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:41.935
We hope you want to hear us sing lots and lots more from here on too!

00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:43.696
BAU BAU!

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:44.957
Thank you!

00:10:45.057 --> 00:10:46.118
BAU BAU!

00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:47.058
Arigatou!

00:10:47.378 --> 00:10:49.120
You know, we released that friend.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.424
If they're gonna hear the rest of that good tweet, I wonder if we should do something like that again maybe, Moco-chan?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.542
I don't think the Ruffians will say no.

00:10:59.762 --> 00:11:01.504
BAU BAU!

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:13.504
You know, like we mentioned, it's been a long time since FUWAMOCO, since we last released a song cover.

00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:14.784
But!

00:11:14.984 --> 00:11:15.425
But!

00:11:16.165 --> 00:11:22.308
If it's together with Advent, we actually have something brand new for you!

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:30.531
We just released an English version of I'm Right Free together with Advent over on the hololive official channel!

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.112
The English channel!

00:11:33.733 --> 00:11:34.613
Ruffians!

00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:38.696
Did you have a chance to listen to it?

00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:40.357
BAU BAU!

00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:43.559
Thank you!

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:43.940
Thank you!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.960
So good!

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.162
Thank you!

00:11:47.562 --> 00:11:53.306
You know, FUWAMOCO, we're really so happy we're able to sing it all together with Advent.

00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:56.208
Because it's a song that really means a lot to us.

00:11:56.288 --> 00:11:57.409
I know we say that a lot!

00:11:57.669 --> 00:11:58.249
But really, really.

00:11:58.309 --> 00:11:59.010
It does!

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.791
You know, we remember being

00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:09.120
Back in the cellar, listening to it, wondering if maybe we'd be up there on that big stage at fest one day.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.760
I don't know.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:18.142
To us, it's a song that both represents a lot of hope, but also equal uncertainty for us.

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.863
We just wanted to be out of the cell so badly.

00:12:22.344 --> 00:12:24.966
I know, of course, the lyrics really resonate a lot with us.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:28.168
So we hope that you'll feel the message of this song in English, too.

00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:28.329
Yeah!

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:35.294
You know, because it's in English, I think the message can kind of reach you a little bit easier this time.

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:37.636
So, we're really happy.

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:42.840
And also, you know, you can find this cover on YouTube.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.360
YouTube.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.661
YouTube for now.

00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:45.462
But!

00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:51.046
Very shortly, it will be released on streaming services all across the place.

00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:54.372
At midnight July 20th in your area.

00:12:54.392 --> 00:12:57.117
So I think maybe a few more hours.

00:12:57.999 --> 00:12:58.980
Maybe for Japan.

00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:00.243
Just now!

00:13:00.343 --> 00:13:00.944
Just now?

00:13:01.024 --> 00:13:01.445
Just now.

00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:02.988
Unless I'm being a little silly.

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:06.015
FUWAMOCO Please listen to our friends!

00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:10.498
FUWAMOCO We're gonna make sure Mama Puppy knows too!

00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:13.080
FUWAMOCO The Ruffians know already!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.644
FUWAMOCO Mama Puppy keeps on asking, when can I listen to this repeat?

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.646
FUWAMOCO Now you can, Mama Puppy!

00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:22.707
FUWAMOCO Yeah!

00:13:23.487 --> 00:13:24.148
In 7 hours!

00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:26.190
A little bit longer.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.953
Really soon, right?

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:40.642
But you know, we hope that we can cheer you on with this song and that, you know, maybe we could listen a little bit closely and see just how hard we've worked to improve our singing.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.383
Did you notice my favorite part?

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:45.566
I talked about it a bit with Nerissa.

00:13:47.817 --> 00:13:48.498
Do you know this?

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:51.901
It's a bit different compared to the Japanese version.

00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:53.822
I don't think the Ruffians probably know this.

00:13:53.842 --> 00:13:54.683
You know this!

00:13:55.164 --> 00:13:56.385
Really?

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:57.285
Really?

00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:58.947
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:14.417
We know we're almost at our first year anniversary, but of course, Abyss just started our idol journey, so we hope that you'll continue to cheer us on lots and lots!

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.579
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:19.960
BAU BAU!

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.423
I'm so happy, my artwork is so cute!

00:14:25.483 --> 00:14:26.924
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:14:27.864 --> 00:14:29.946
BAU BAU!

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:34.044
I hope we can release more covers soon!

00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:36.746
Right, the English versions are so nice, huh?

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:37.366
Yeah.

00:14:37.686 --> 00:14:44.890
You know, the nice thing is that the message can reach you a little bit easier, so... It's extra special.

00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:47.812
BAU BAU!

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:51.128
Well, I feel like we have a bit of a pattern.

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:52.490
Right, Moco-chan?

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.210
What do you mean?

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.232
Disappointing.

00:14:55.673 --> 00:14:56.214
Happy.

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:57.656
Happy.

00:14:58.777 --> 00:14:59.498
Disappointing.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.762
We're on the disappointing part again.

00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:06.566
Ruffians!

00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:08.829
You know what?

00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:16.485
There's been something bad that happened that's causing a little bit of a rift between us.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.146
Yeah.

00:15:20.466 --> 00:15:24.728
And Ruffians, no, it's not what happened during Chain Together yesterday, no?

00:15:24.808 --> 00:15:25.848
No.

00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:32.190
And, you know, FUWAMOCO, we always say that nothing would ever come between us.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.712
But, yeah, there's been an accident.

00:15:38.565 --> 00:15:41.893
Actually Ruffians, it happened the other day.

00:15:41.913 --> 00:15:44.077
Moco-chan here!

00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:46.562
She broke my bag.

00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:49.557
Yeah.

00:15:50.077 --> 00:15:54.379
You know, Moco-chan was drinking a water bottle from my bag.

00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:59.400
And so I asked her to put it back into my bag and then... Somehow!

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.501
You just absolutely ruined the zipper!

00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:03.862
No, it's not like that.

00:16:04.062 --> 00:16:05.642
It's just destroyed now!

00:16:05.722 --> 00:16:06.182
It's not like that.

00:16:06.222 --> 00:16:08.063
You did it in like five seconds.

00:16:08.103 --> 00:16:10.424
I wasn't drinking the water bottle in the bag.

00:16:12.244 --> 00:16:14.665
No, if you were, then the zipper would still be alive.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:16.785
How do you drink a water bottle in a bag?

00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:18.386
No.

00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:23.150
But not because Moco-chan just killed it!

00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:27.495
Now I can only open up my bag just a little way!

00:16:28.056 --> 00:16:32.261
So you know, it's really tricky getting anything slightly larger into it.

00:16:34.723 --> 00:16:35.664
And more friends!

00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:36.686
You know what?

00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:38.187
Moco-chan!

00:16:39.175 --> 00:16:40.476
This puppy here!

00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:40.556
Huh?

00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:44.058
Still gets upset, you know what I tell him?

00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:44.318
No!

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:44.958
No, Moco-chan!

00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:46.319
You can't put that in my bag!

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:47.040
It won't fit!

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.180
I don't remember.

00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:50.702
You know, Moco-chan, you can put it in your own bag!

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:51.943
I don't remember, okay?

00:16:52.003 --> 00:16:52.243
Yeah.

00:16:52.903 --> 00:16:54.304
Don't get Stephen Great dog!

00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:55.485
I remember.

00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:56.465
I remember, too.

00:16:57.526 --> 00:16:59.247
My bag is broken now.

00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:02.489
Put it in your own bag, Moco-chan, okay?

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.090
But you didn't do anything!

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.911
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?

00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:06.371
You know.

00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:07.612
It just happened.

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:10.810
That's how it happens, okay?

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.953
You know, I was hoping I could fix it, but... The zipper teeth are broken.

00:17:17.434 --> 00:17:26.940
It's all like... You know, and I thought maybe... Maybe Mane-chan might be able to fix it, but... I don't want to burden her with it, too.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.740
What should we do?

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.021
Muffins.

00:17:32.281 --> 00:17:33.821
Can you fix the muffins?

00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:35.362
Can!

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:38.543
Moco-chan, that's not gonna fix it!

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:40.363
Back to cheap!

00:17:40.864 --> 00:17:43.144
Maybe.

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:45.645
Can!

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:50.107
Moco-chan, you think that's gonna maybe kinda make the zipper slide a bit more?

00:17:50.127 --> 00:17:50.847
Cause it's not.

00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:56.338
BAU BAU!

00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:57.959
I didn't mean to.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.202
I drank the water bottle outside of the thing.

00:18:02.544 --> 00:18:02.964
Yeah.

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:06.347
FUWAMOCO-chan, maybe we'll just have to go shopping.

00:18:07.689 --> 00:18:08.570
Along with the balls.

00:18:09.731 --> 00:18:10.171
Yeah.

00:18:10.652 --> 00:18:11.593
Bag and balls.

00:18:11.913 --> 00:18:12.794
Bag and balls.

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:15.983
BAU BAU!

00:18:16.103 --> 00:18:17.143
BAU BAU!

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:18.263
I forgive you, Moco-chan.

00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:20.264
If anything, it's kind of impressive.

00:18:20.764 --> 00:18:21.744
It wasn't my fault.

00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:25.905
Yeah, and you didn't once ask me to fix it myself either.

00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:29.166
I tried to fix it myself, I didn't say anything.

00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:33.667
I thought you'd pass my bag back and be like, well, I broke it.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:34.527
No!

00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:37.788
I'm not unapologetic.

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:39.088
I'm just saying how it is.

00:18:39.108 --> 00:18:40.509
Okay.

00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:41.789
It's broken.

00:18:43.263 --> 00:18:43.703
BAU BAU!

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:05.138
You know I go through this disappointment thing.

00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:07.361
Now we have an exciting day!

00:19:08.322 --> 00:19:09.163
Ruffians!

00:19:09.724 --> 00:19:12.747
We got a brand new FUWAMOCO school!

00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:19.035
Thank you so much to D&F Ridescream for the impactful journalism!

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:20.858
BAU BAU!

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:33.666
Well, this summer Nenechi is going to be having a special event at Tokyo Joypolis as part of their Kabuto Kuwagata Fureai no Moriyama!

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:36.568
We're so happy for her!

00:19:36.688 --> 00:19:41.171
If you didn't know Nenechi, she loves Japanese dog beetles.

00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:41.792
Do you know them?

00:19:42.612 --> 00:19:44.374
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:03.490
Yeah, and you know at the event you can get up and close with the beetles.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.252
So, I kinda wanna check it out too.

00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:06.752
Right!

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:09.653
Right, we think stag beetles are really cool.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:10.094
Yeah!

00:20:10.114 --> 00:20:13.455
We never, we never, you know, seen them or touched them.

00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:14.116
Yeah.

00:20:14.156 --> 00:20:16.317
We don't have them in the Northwest Passage though.

00:20:16.577 --> 00:20:17.137
Yeah.

00:20:17.498 --> 00:20:18.498
So, it makes sense.

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:24.701
But, for stories, can you really make them battle against each other?

00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:25.822
You can battle them, right?

00:20:26.437 --> 00:20:29.120
My stag beetle will be your stag beetle!

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.203
Like that kind of thing!

00:20:31.543 --> 00:20:31.943
Why?

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:33.025
Why?

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:41.743
They're Pokemon.

00:20:41.983 --> 00:20:43.284
That's what I was thinking.

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:45.925
They're like, bug Pokemon.

00:20:46.065 --> 00:20:51.069
I don't know, what kind of sounds do they make, too?

00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:51.589
I don't know.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.231
Do they make a sound like a me-me-me-me-me?

00:20:55.251 --> 00:20:58.754
No, it's like a... Like that?

00:20:58.894 --> 00:20:59.274
Yeah.

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:00.475
I don't know.

00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:02.136
I don't know much about that.

00:21:02.176 --> 00:21:03.177
Hissing sounds.

00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:04.498
Hissing sounds?

00:21:04.758 --> 00:21:06.599
Oh, I wanna hear that then.

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:08.120
That would be really scary!

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.741
I don't wanna battle against one.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.801
Well, no matter the sound, they look really cute.

00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:14.802
They do look cute.

00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:15.462
Yeah.

00:21:15.822 --> 00:21:19.624
Actually, we were recently talking to Shiori about them too.

00:21:19.664 --> 00:21:20.485
Yeah.

00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:23.286
I think she's kind of curious too, right?

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:24.446
Yeah.

00:21:24.526 --> 00:21:28.388
We'd really like to get to know more about that.

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:28.949
Yeah.

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:33.451
Maybe together with Shiori and Nene-chi can teach us.

00:21:33.651 --> 00:21:35.852
I don't know if Shiori's just interested in eating them.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.690
Maybe.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.972
I don't think Nenechi wants that.

00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:41.132
I don't think so, no.

00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:41.492
No.

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.474
BAU BAU!

00:21:43.574 --> 00:21:46.375
BAU BAU!

00:21:46.676 --> 00:21:48.997
Good luck, Nenechi!

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:49.977
Yeah!

00:21:49.997 --> 00:21:51.598
Congratulations!

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.520
So exciting!

00:21:55.161 --> 00:21:55.981
BAU BAU!

00:21:57.762 --> 00:22:04.625
Well, you know, Ruffians, we're already about halfway, a little bit more than that, to July.

00:22:04.945 --> 00:22:06.926
July is officially summer.

00:22:06.946 --> 00:22:08.407
And this summer...

00:22:09.608 --> 00:22:12.571
It's the summer of Advent!

00:22:12.951 --> 00:22:16.634
And our 3D debut is just right around the corner!

00:22:16.654 --> 00:22:19.217
There's so many exciting things happening!

00:22:19.277 --> 00:22:23.040
A big whole EN concert in New York City!

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.485
But you know, between all those exciting things going on, actually...

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:38.848
FUWAMOCO, we really want to be able to go to omatsuri, you know, a summertime festival, all together with Abyss!

00:22:38.888 --> 00:22:45.930
You know, it'll be nice to be able to go all dressed up in yukata, you know, have kakigori, shaved ice, yakisoba.

00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:50.653
See some taiko.

00:22:50.773 --> 00:22:52.254
The drum performances.

00:22:52.634 --> 00:22:53.895
Do some kingyo-sukui.

00:22:53.935 --> 00:22:56.617
You know, the goldfish scooping.

00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:59.319
Living so much fun all together!

00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:01.180
It sounds nice, yeah!

00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:05.804
You know, having some ramen and trying to open it all together.

00:23:05.924 --> 00:23:08.325
Tama-ya!

00:23:08.425 --> 00:23:09.826
Haba-e!

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:11.348
Ringo-wame!

00:23:11.408 --> 00:23:12.729
Shateki!

00:23:12.889 --> 00:23:15.691
Doing some shiori games too.

00:23:15.711 --> 00:23:17.532
Shiori can win me some

00:23:18.072 --> 00:23:18.813
Hi!

00:23:18.993 --> 00:23:20.614
Or maybe Biboo.

00:23:20.654 --> 00:23:20.934
Yeah.

00:23:21.815 --> 00:23:24.177
Shiori can try, Biboo will finish the job.

00:23:24.257 --> 00:23:26.818
Yeah!

00:23:26.898 --> 00:23:33.023
You know, we really would like to have an All Night City episode experience together with them all.

00:23:33.563 --> 00:23:36.365
But, I don't know, it's been so busy.

00:23:36.405 --> 00:23:36.745
Yeah.

00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:37.266
I don't know.

00:23:37.286 --> 00:23:40.928
I'm a little bit worried that we might not be able to do it.

00:23:41.008 --> 00:23:41.188
Yeah.

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:42.730
But, I think...

00:23:43.683 --> 00:23:51.711
If I had to choose one summer activity out of it, then I would like to do fireworks with them.

00:23:51.751 --> 00:23:53.012
Not the big ones, you know.

00:23:53.352 --> 00:23:56.435
Just the tiny little ones.

00:23:56.596 --> 00:23:57.757
The not scary ones.

00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:01.440
The big ones are sort of scary to us demon dogs, you know.

00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:07.282
Fluffy and fuzzy, but... I wanna make summer memories together during my Summer of Advent, too!

00:24:07.342 --> 00:24:07.803
Right!

00:24:08.703 --> 00:24:09.503
The sparklers!

00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:11.524
Can you pull out those sparklers?

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:19.766
The little ones you hold, you know... They have the... The one that you hold and it has the... The end and then it folds and you... That one.

00:24:19.866 --> 00:24:20.266
Yeah.

00:24:25.301 --> 00:24:34.810
But you know, I think if it's fireworks, little fireworks, maybe we might be able to get something done together.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.055
At least we'll do our best to get that one thing done.

00:24:39.075 --> 00:24:41.237
Even if we can't make it to a festival.

00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:49.280
And then you know, that way, we can put a nice end to the summer with Advent.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.181
BAU BAU!

00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:56.902
What do you want to do at the O-matsuri, Ruffians?

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.923
Gingyo-sukui.

00:24:59.003 --> 00:25:00.603
I feel a bit bad for the fish.

00:25:00.944 --> 00:25:04.925
You don't need to take it home, you're just going to scoop it up and then be like, there you go, Mr. Fish.

00:25:05.005 --> 00:25:05.745
Back you go.

00:25:05.765 --> 00:25:07.726
Back you go.

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:08.626
You want to eat.

00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:10.147
Eat.

00:25:10.487 --> 00:25:11.227
Not the gun.

00:25:11.487 --> 00:25:12.788
You can eat all the time.

00:25:12.828 --> 00:25:14.148
You eat everything.

00:25:14.188 --> 00:25:15.149
Naminé.

00:25:15.209 --> 00:25:15.769
Wait.

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:16.329
Naminé.

00:25:16.629 --> 00:25:18.950
I want to drink Naminé all together.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.031
Do you think Advent can find Naminé in the glass bottle in the Biboo?

00:25:23.051 --> 00:25:23.691
I don't know.

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.311
I feel like Biboo would be confused.

00:25:25.572 --> 00:25:29.353
I think Nerissa would open it and she'd be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:25:29.473 --> 00:25:31.993
It'd be like exploding all over the place.

00:25:32.954 --> 00:25:33.874
Sounds accurate.

00:25:36.249 --> 00:25:38.931
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning deshita</i>.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.652
It's a great summer out there.

00:25:56.113 --> 00:25:58.515
BAU BAU!

00:25:58.535 --> 00:26:01.097
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:04.661
Let's take a look at who's our Doggie of the Day today!

00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:09.105
Our Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:26:09.145 --> 00:26:10.306
Jack-chan!

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:13.409
Jack-chan is so proper!

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:15.551
It looks like Jack-chan is going to do accounting.

00:26:15.732 --> 00:26:16.352
Yeah!

00:26:16.372 --> 00:26:17.213
Accounting Jack-chan.

00:26:17.373 --> 00:26:18.653
BAU BAU!

00:26:18.894 --> 00:26:19.294
BAU BAU!

00:26:43.412 --> 00:26:43.632
BAU BAU.

00:26:43.672 --> 00:26:44.412
Like that.

00:26:44.472 --> 00:27:12.917

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:15.038
He's totally spoiled.

00:27:15.979 --> 00:27:22.763
He doesn't need to work a job because he gets any treat or toy or outfit he wants.

00:27:23.304 --> 00:27:26.306
Because he's Jackson!

00:27:26.406 --> 00:27:26.846
I'm Jackson!

00:27:29.628 --> 00:27:30.708
Yeah, I know.

00:27:31.229 --> 00:27:37.852
It's because he's cute and he loves you that he won't let anything get in his way of cuddling and playing with you.

00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:40.152
I go it for his walks too!

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:42.634
BAU BAU!

00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:45.775
He has fuzzy ears like Papa Puppy.

00:27:45.795 --> 00:27:50.077
Papa Puppy's a bit wild, right?

00:27:50.537 --> 00:27:51.137
Yeah.

00:27:51.857 --> 00:27:52.218
Yeah.

00:27:52.238 --> 00:27:53.798
Wow, very fierce, Jackson.

00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:55.019
Very fierce.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.520
BAU BAU!

00:27:58.857 --> 00:28:04.379
And it's summertime, so naturally, Ruffians, you're going out and checking out the summer sky, right?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.940
Let's see where you've been walking around!

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.561
De-den!

00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:09.781
The beach!

00:28:10.062 --> 00:28:13.783
The summer sun!

00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:15.424
Beautiful beach, huh?

00:28:15.664 --> 00:28:17.244
A beach of all kinds.

00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:18.105
As expected of summer.

00:28:18.785 --> 00:28:19.305
Yeah.

00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:21.306
I don't know.

00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:23.627
I feel like you're so brave, you know?

00:28:24.007 --> 00:28:25.888
The beach is a bunch of people, then.

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:31.157
Maybe you know this is early, maybe it's cold, maybe they're not there yet.

00:28:31.358 --> 00:28:32.980
Maybe it's still chilly hot.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.525
Did you bring back a bunch of sand in your shoes?

00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:40.731
That's always the best part, huh?

00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:42.434
All the sand that comes home with you, huh?

00:28:43.735 --> 00:28:47.018
Well, maybe, you know, you got some cool shells while you were there.

00:28:47.278 --> 00:28:49.299
Saw some silly crows.

00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:49.579
Yeah!

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.760
Yeah, but, you know.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.222
Poke them with a stick.

00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:58.205
But the best, the best memories, the best memories that you make there, that's your souvenir.

00:28:58.245 --> 00:28:58.966
Yeah!

00:28:59.026 --> 00:28:59.727
Not the sand.

00:29:00.027 --> 00:29:00.667
Not the sand.

00:29:00.747 --> 00:29:01.308
Not the shells.

00:29:01.328 --> 00:29:01.828
And the photo!

00:29:01.988 --> 00:29:03.569
Yeah, the photo's a good souvenir.

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:04.090
Maybe...

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.611
You know, this is a souvenir too.

00:29:08.672 --> 00:29:10.773
BAU BAU!

00:29:10.793 --> 00:29:12.934
Nice beach walk.

00:29:12.994 --> 00:29:16.536
Ruffians, why are you saying FUWAMOCO in a bathing suit?

00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:19.597
At least imagine this Ruffian in a bathing suit.

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:20.297
Why?

00:29:20.497 --> 00:29:23.539
FUWAMOCO didn't go on the beach walk a Ruffian did.

00:29:23.579 --> 00:29:24.719
This Ruffian did.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.620
Yeah.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.161
We don't know if they went on the walk in a bathing suit.

00:29:28.421 --> 00:29:33.106
Maybe they went for a swim too.

00:29:33.927 --> 00:29:36.169
BAU BAU!

00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:41.594
And next for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:44.357
Morning FUWAMOCO!

00:29:44.737 --> 00:29:52.004
You've been together your entire lives, but has working hololive and playing frustrating games together made you guys closer?

00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:55.929
Has working together made you realize more of each other's faults?

00:29:56.489 --> 00:29:58.672
How do you handle being together all the time?

00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:03.938
Has it changed anything?

00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:07.562
You know we spent 2000 years together.

00:30:07.582 --> 00:30:10.525
I don't think anything's changed, Ruffians.

00:30:12.391 --> 00:30:12.691
Yeah.

00:30:12.891 --> 00:30:13.272
Yup.

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.033
I don't know.

00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:16.574
We're FUWAMOCO.

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:18.355
We're pretty close.

00:30:18.415 --> 00:30:19.735
We know our faults.

00:30:19.775 --> 00:30:22.357
We know our strength, you know.

00:30:22.377 --> 00:30:25.439
Moco-chan's kind of like this right now.

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:27.020
Okay, it's kind of over.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.840
Yeah.

00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:32.722
You know, I think it's just kind of the same.

00:30:32.882 --> 00:30:33.262
Yeah?

00:30:33.362 --> 00:30:33.782
Yeah.

00:30:33.862 --> 00:30:35.743
Demon bond dog- Demon bond dog?

00:30:35.983 --> 00:30:37.863
Demon dog bond is too strong.

00:30:37.923 --> 00:30:38.463
Why?

00:30:38.624 --> 00:30:39.584
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:40.644
It's just how it is.

00:30:40.844 --> 00:30:45.466
Yeah, and I've been seeing us bicker quite a bit sometimes.

00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:45.886
Yeah!

00:30:46.066 --> 00:30:46.926
It's just how it goes.

00:30:46.946 --> 00:30:48.767
Yeah, sometimes that's just the process, you know?

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:49.767
It's just the process.

00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:50.487
Yeah.

00:30:50.527 --> 00:30:51.308
Nothing changes.

00:30:53.903 --> 00:30:54.846
I don't think it's changed.

00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:56.652
Sometimes it's rougher than other times.

00:30:57.836 --> 00:30:59.421
It's been a year but nothing's changed.

00:30:59.903 --> 00:31:00.104
No.

00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:00.605
No.

00:31:01.887 --> 00:31:02.688
This is how it is.

00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:10.392
But we feel very lucky, you know, Ruffians, because I think there's not many siblings, not even many twins, that have a bone like us.

00:31:10.552 --> 00:31:10.832
No.

00:31:11.072 --> 00:31:13.674
So we're very lucky, like Moco-chan.

00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:14.555
Yeah.

00:31:15.015 --> 00:31:16.936
BAU BAU!

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:21.919
Yeah, I don't think it's a normal sibling thing.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.861
Not very common, no.

00:31:24.961 --> 00:31:25.621
Yeah.

00:31:26.361 --> 00:31:28.303
BAU BAU!

00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:30.804
Well, we have another stream coming up

00:31:31.084 --> 00:31:41.811
Well, we have that.

00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:43.893
It's been about three months.

00:31:44.293 --> 00:31:46.274
All of a sudden, two months.

00:31:46.334 --> 00:31:47.035
Maybe three months.

00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:47.955
It feels like three months.

00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:49.136
Maybe that's two months.

00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:51.317
It's been way too long!

00:31:51.357 --> 00:31:52.398
Way too long!

00:31:52.518 --> 00:31:53.739
But it's back now!

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:54.740
Back!

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.321
And we're gonna be singing some anime songs!

00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:59.783
Some of our favorites.

00:31:59.883 --> 00:32:01.804
There's too many favorites.

00:32:02.104 --> 00:32:04.506
Yeah, maybe some surprising ones too.

00:32:04.926 --> 00:32:21.416
So we hope that you're ready to BAU BAU lolololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololol

00:32:22.016 --> 00:32:24.797
And then we take a look at our schedule.

00:32:24.997 --> 00:32:28.459
We have the Rock n' Rawr Party coming up very shortly.

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:34.901
But then on Saturday, FUWAMOCO, we're gonna be in Sydney for a smash!

00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:38.983
We're gonna be talking with some Ruffians at a fan meeting.

00:32:39.003 --> 00:32:43.605
And then later we have a mini Rock n' Rawr Party and Q&A.

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:48.647
So we're gonna be able to answer some Australian Ruffians' questions.

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:50.348
Australian questions, me.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.834
Please join us on GAMBLERFEST!

00:32:56.114 --> 00:32:58.458
You know, maybe you happen to be in the area.

00:32:58.478 --> 00:32:58.618
Right.

00:33:00.986 --> 00:33:02.947
Please come see us, okay?

00:33:03.027 --> 00:33:04.228
BAU BAU!

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:05.048
BAU BAU!

00:33:05.168 --> 00:33:08.450
And then on Sunday, we're gonna get violent!

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.330
Violent!

00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:15.154
Because it's Advent versus Justice in Party Animals!

00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:17.355
There's no question about it, we're gonna win.

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:18.175
We're gonna win.

00:33:18.655 --> 00:33:19.036
Easy.

00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:19.796
Yeah.

00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:23.038
And Moco-chan will be playing, and Fuwawa will be playing.

00:33:23.358 --> 00:33:25.079
So that means it's five versus four.

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:26.960
There's no question about it.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:27.920
I don't know what they're thinking.

00:33:28.181 --> 00:33:28.841
Have you seen

00:33:29.388 --> 00:33:31.328
You know, Fuwawa play team together.

00:33:31.348 --> 00:33:32.889
We're gonna win.

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:33.549
Yeah.

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:36.970
I'm a bit unpredictable, Ruffians.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.970
You better watch out.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.590
Never know where she's gonna jump off.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.171
BAU BAU!

00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:44.071
BAU BAU!

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.651
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:46.512
Thank you!

00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:50.392
And for the Ruffians who are joining us today through the archive!

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.953
Here is your FUWAMOCO word!

00:33:52.973 --> 00:33:55.493
It's BAU BAU Kuwagata!

00:33:55.553 --> 00:33:56.614
BAU BAU!

00:33:56.674 --> 00:33:57.534
BAU BAU!

00:33:59.015 --> 00:34:01.256
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:34:01.316 --> 00:34:04.578
Thank you for joining us today for FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:34:05.038 --> 00:34:09.361
And for, you know, waking up early this entire week to spend it with us.

00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:12.042
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:34:12.182 --> 00:34:13.303
BAU BAU!

00:34:13.363 --> 00:34:14.063
