Did you sleep well?

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:43.825

We're almost at 70!

00:05:59.177 --> 00:05:59.758
Almost 70!

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.439
BAU BAU!

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.581

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:15.513
FUWAMOCO!

00:06:16.194 --> 00:06:17.135

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:39.409
Nice BAU BAU!

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:40.629
Are you BAU?

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:41.430
BAU the best!

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.951
Almost at 70.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:43.391
Right?

00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:43.811
Right!

00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:49.034
We haven't slept in.

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:50.555
We haven't, Ruffians!

00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:55.536
We haven't slept in!

00:06:55.577 --> 00:06:55.837
Right?

00:06:56.637 --> 00:06:58.557
BAU BAU!

00:06:58.577 --> 00:06:59.798
FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:00.978
Happy morning.

00:07:01.478 --> 00:07:02.239
Seems sleepy.

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.880
I have a big problem.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.120
What?

00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:11.985
Ruffians.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:16.366
Surely it's too cold and you know Pero's not quite around, right?

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:19.187
He's somewhere warmer.

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:22.708
You know, like in the middle of the earth or something.

00:07:22.728 --> 00:07:23.749
The middle of the earth!

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:25.549
Somewhere warm, you know.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.171
There has been another Pero Sighting.

00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:34.492
Why?

00:07:34.932 --> 00:07:35.512
Why?

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:40.314
I think the Ruffians just have too sharp eyes.

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:40.994
Sharp eyes, huh?

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:43.639
Wow!

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:46.220
Pero was spotted!

00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:48.042
De-den!

00:07:48.442 --> 00:07:48.582
Oh!

00:07:49.183 --> 00:07:49.343
Oh!

00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:51.524
Oh!

00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:54.266
You saw Pero on your campus!

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:58.209
But you gave him a scarf and a hat!

00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:04.034
You know, that's really kind of you.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.761
Good idea to tea him like that.

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:09.602
Yeah, you know it.

00:08:11.363 --> 00:08:14.365
Have you stared into the little black eyes of his before?

00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:16.346
Try it.

00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:18.467
Ruffian stare.

00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:19.008
Do it.

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.134
BAU BAU!

00:08:56.007 --> 00:08:59.388
Well, you know, he does look very warm, he does.

00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:02.769
A bit fluffy and fuzzy even!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.030
Like, like a cute grandma!

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.790
I'm pretty sure!

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.231
Yeah, he does look like a cute grandma.

00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:11.312
Yeah, but don't, don't be fooled by fans, okay?

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:13.493
He's not a grandma.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:14.814
He's Pero.

00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:15.294
Yeah.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:15.674
Yeah.

00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:17.028
He won't be knitting.

00:09:17.568 --> 00:09:18.969
He won't be drinking tea.

00:09:20.229 --> 00:09:23.271
He's up to nasty stuff, okay?

00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:25.152
Guys, he's Pero, okay?

00:09:26.453 --> 00:09:28.294
He's not your grandma!

00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:30.415
You're being fooled, okay?

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:31.776
No.

00:09:32.496 --> 00:09:32.817
No.

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:34.297
You can change him.

00:09:34.337 --> 00:09:35.518
No, Pero's Pero.

00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:36.879
Pero is nasty.

00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:40.081
Yeah, don't fool yourself, okay?

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:45.306
Ruffians, please make sure, be careful if you see him around, okay?

00:09:45.486 --> 00:09:50.412
If someone comes up to you and says that they're your grandma, don't believe them.

00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:51.913
Don't believe them, okay?

00:09:52.454 --> 00:09:53.935
BAU BAU!

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.571
I'm a bit concerned about the Ruffians.

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:00.733
You're being too kind, Ruffians!

00:10:00.773 --> 00:10:02.855
You can't be deceived that easily, okay?

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:03.795
Be careful.

00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:04.976
You have to be careful.

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:05.897
Avoid eye contact.

00:10:06.137 --> 00:10:06.737
Exactly.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:09.399
Well!

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.141
We have some...

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:14.303
Happy New Year!

00:10:14.883 --> 00:10:15.903
Ruffians!

00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:19.805
Exciting things are going on!

00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:33.049
It was just announced that FUWAMOCO will be participating in the hololive X capsule collab for the lantern festival in Tainan!

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:35.249
BAU BAU!

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.710
We're so excited!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.471
Look at us, the Ruffians!

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.433
Together with our senpai!

00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:47.554
The club, for a bit more information.

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:50.656
The club will be going on from February 24th.

00:10:50.676 --> 00:10:54.038
So about a month from now.

00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:57.601
February 24th to March 10th.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:02.124
There will be a bunch of fun things to check out.

00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:05.046
Ruffians will keep on getting more and more surprises.

00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:05.206
Oh!

00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:05.406
This!

00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:06.566
That too!

00:11:07.727 --> 00:11:08.968
That too!

00:11:09.348 --> 00:11:10.129
Oh my gosh.

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:14.170
It's our first time being invited to something like this.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.231
We're really, really happy!

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:23.113
We can't wait for the event to start, so hopefully you decide to go check out and enjoy the lantern festival with us in Tainan!

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:25.374
BAU BAU!

00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:30.895
Thank you, it must be our first time.

00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:32.536
BAU BAU!

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:33.576
Got it!

00:11:35.357 --> 00:11:35.857
Got it!

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:37.437
Got it.

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:42.831
Well, you might already know.

00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:53.417
But, you know, usually, Ruffians, we have a weekly collab with Advent, right?

00:11:53.457 --> 00:11:54.658
We do!

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:59.561
But this week, instead of our regular collab, we're doing something really special!

00:12:00.362 --> 00:12:05.185
Yeah, we're gonna be having our first ever Advent Karaoke Relay!

00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:11.713
It will start at 6PM PT, just like usual.

00:12:11.854 --> 00:12:15.278
And we'll all be singing for 30 minutes each.

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:17.161
FUWAMOCO, Shiori, Biboo, Nerissa, then FUWAMOCO!

00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:23.112
Yeah.

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:24.073
Ah, but.

00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:24.193
But.

00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:24.634
But.

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:25.355
Yeah.

00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:33.505
This time, you know, we're actually going to be doing an unarchived karaoke at the end to count it off.

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:33.765
Yeah!

00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:33.965
Yeah!

00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:35.107
This is unarchived.

00:12:35.147 --> 00:12:37.450
That means you definitely can't miss it, right?

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.112
Right!

00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:39.432
Yeah.

00:12:41.214 --> 00:12:43.615
Oh boy, I wonder what the other girls will be singing.

00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:44.436
Right!

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:49.518
We're not sure if it's going to be archived or unarchived, so you'll definitely need to be there.

00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.100
You have to be there!

00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:01.404
We're really looking forward to all the fun singing that we're going to have and listening to Advent's beautiful singing voices too.

00:13:01.544 --> 00:13:02.885
Everybody's so unique.

00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:05.987
Let's make sure to prepare our palettes, okay?

00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:07.467
Lots of fun.

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:08.528
BAU BAU!

00:13:12.614 --> 00:13:17.161
Who is Bijou?

00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:18.162
I don't know.

00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:21.247
The sparkling gem of Advent.

00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:22.589
Biboo.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.852
If Bijou is the sparkling gem of Advent, then...

00:13:25.862 --> 00:13:26.403
Who's Biboo?

00:13:26.443 --> 00:13:27.063
Biboo Koteki.

00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:29.065
Biboo Koteki?

00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:30.446
Biboo Koteki.

00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:32.348
Got it.

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:34.270
Koteki.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.712
Okay.

00:13:37.653 --> 00:13:38.394
That's who it is.

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:39.235
That's who it is.

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:40.156
Biboo Koteki.

00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:44.139
Ruffians.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.822
FUWAMOCO Ino.

00:13:47.362 --> 00:13:50.826
We actually had something very special happen.

00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:58.269
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:29.430
The other day, one of FUWAMOCO Morning's idols, Naruse Eimi, Eitaso!

00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:35.876
She was a member of Dempagumi Inc., an idol group that we really, really liked!

00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:37.978
Definitely one of our favorites.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:39.099
She tweeted,

00:14:40.322 --> 00:14:40.762
BAU BAU!

00:14:41.143 --> 00:14:41.583

00:14:41.603 --> 00:14:41.984
BAU BAU!

00:14:57.257 --> 00:14:59.459
I feel really really happy!

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.420
But a bit embarrassed too!

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:11.026
She was my favorite member back when she was a part of the group and actually I still think about her a lot.

00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:11.947
BAU!

00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:12.068
BAU!

00:15:12.408 --> 00:15:12.488
BAU!

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:36.805
You know, she always wanted to be a bright source of light for everyone.

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:38.985
Kind of like the sun, you know?

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:42.186
And she absolutely did that.

00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:42.866
You know, Dempagumi...

00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:48.388
They always said that their rival was in another idol group, but actually pretty cute!

00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:53.249
And actually, Eitaso even became the seiyu for PreCure Star!

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:55.370
Elite Star Twinkle PreCure.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.110
Yeah!

00:15:57.045 --> 00:15:57.685
BAU BAU.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.764
Actually, you know, Icomochi-mama is also a really big fan of Denpagumi, too.

00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:31.645
Right!

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:35.748
We can't wait to chat with Icomochi-mama about Denpagumi stuff, too.

00:16:35.848 --> 00:16:40.931
Yeah, you know, we could talk for a very, very, very long time.

00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:46.475
But hopefully we can sing more Denpagumi songs at our rock n' rawr parties, too.

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:46.736
Right.

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:47.716
BAU BAU!

00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:49.498
FUWAMOCO!

00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:06.762
Ruffians!

00:17:07.863 --> 00:17:22.391
Yesterday there was a lot going on, but actually, Ichijo Ririka of ReGLOSS, she had a stream where she learned some English phrases, some words from us hololive English members!

00:17:22.771 --> 00:17:23.652
Did you check it out?

00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:26.894
It was really silly and cute to see her do her best,

00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:33.698
Rai tried to learn as much as she can.

00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:38.801
I don't know if we're a really good example, but... Well... We're something.

00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:40.822
Yeah, we shared the line.

00:17:41.423 --> 00:17:45.185
You know, have a howl of a day!

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:52.690
But... That aside, for some reason, Ririka... She says she wants to become a sandwich with us.

00:17:54.591 --> 00:17:54.951
Huh?

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:55.792
A sandwich?

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:00.415
That doesn't have to do anything with our... Our line.

00:18:01.673 --> 00:18:02.313
We're not.

00:18:02.594 --> 00:18:03.814
Not have a sandwich!

00:18:03.974 --> 00:18:04.234
No!

00:18:04.254 --> 00:18:05.455
Not have a sandwich today!

00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:06.276
We're not food!

00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:07.696
We're demon dogs!

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:08.377
Yeah!

00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:09.897
Ruffy and fuzzy!

00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:10.138
Yeah!

00:18:10.198 --> 00:18:10.838
Not food!

00:18:10.898 --> 00:18:11.578
Not a sandwich!

00:18:11.598 --> 00:18:14.840
I don't think you want your food very fluffy or fuzzy, huh?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.521
No.

00:18:15.641 --> 00:18:16.961
No fluffy fuzzy sandwiches.

00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:17.362
No.

00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:17.982
No.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:18.302
No.

00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:25.386
That's what I thought, but it seems, Ruffians, that there was a lot of other viewers that felt the same in the chat, too.

00:18:25.426 --> 00:18:25.766
Huh.

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:27.527
Why?

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:29.028
Why?

00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:31.029
We're not food, you know that, right?

00:18:32.518 --> 00:18:33.959
I'm not a hot dog!

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:34.459
No!

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.180
No.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.140
Hot dog?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.062
That's more like Korone-senpai.

00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:44.925
Wait, which hololive- We're saying we're not food, but we're saying that Korone-senpai could be food.

00:18:45.185 --> 00:18:48.466
Could be food.

00:18:50.307 --> 00:18:50.607
Wait.

00:18:51.728 --> 00:18:55.070
Which hololive member is best suited for consumption then?

00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:58.852
I thought you said Mikocchi-senpai, right?

00:18:59.312 --> 00:19:01.113
Ah, but that's Mikocchi-senpai the cookie.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:06.997
Watame-senpai!

00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:09.418
Probably.

00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:10.998
There's no excitement in that.

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.460
Why?!

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.721
Subaru-senpai!

00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:20.463
I like Subaru-senpai as an ice cream cone.

00:19:21.103 --> 00:19:21.623
Why?

00:19:23.244 --> 00:19:24.464
Luna-senpai!

00:19:24.484 --> 00:19:26.625
Luna-senpai could be hard to join.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:33.312
Yeah, Kiara-senpai, there's no excitement in that either.

00:19:34.012 --> 00:19:36.874
Oh, Ame-senpai, because she's a little Ame.

00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:39.837
Ame.

00:19:41.218 --> 00:19:43.840
Okayu-senpai, of course!

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.783
I would like a warm bowl of Okayu-senpai!

00:19:47.843 --> 00:19:48.383
Thank you!

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:50.723
Okay.

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:51.904
Decided.

00:19:52.064 --> 00:19:55.628
That took too long, huh?

00:19:56.208 --> 00:20:02.634
Ruffians, we might not keep your tummy full, but maybe not like a nice bowl of okaeshi soba.

00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:04.276
But we can keep you warm!

00:20:05.096 --> 00:20:06.938
Let's all feel fuzzy.

00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:10.661
Maybe we can also keep your heart full, too.

00:20:11.022 --> 00:20:11.823
But not your tummy.

00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:17.467
But we hope that Ririka continues to do her best getting English.

00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:22.010
We'll do our best to improve our Japanese too.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.352
BAU BAU!

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.533
Mogumogu kaiyo.

00:20:28.555 --> 00:20:31.977
BAU BAU!

00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:33.739
Ruffians.

00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:39.543
Did you get a good sleep last night?

00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:43.822
Rest those eyes, rest those paws.

00:20:44.382 --> 00:20:46.624
Go zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

00:20:47.164 --> 00:20:47.644
Bijou.

00:20:48.345 --> 00:20:48.865
Meow!

00:20:49.265 --> 00:20:50.466
You too, thankfully!

00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:51.406
Not really.

00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:56.889
Moco-chan!

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.210
You have something to say, maybe?

00:21:14.173 --> 00:21:14.593
Moco-chan.

00:21:17.334 --> 00:21:18.034
Ruffians.

00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:20.954
I'm sorry!

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.775
Last night!

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:28.816
During my climb on Watchalong.

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:32.997
I got pretty sleepy there, huh?

00:21:34.017 --> 00:21:35.117
Pretty early on.

00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:38.798
I started...

00:21:42.608 --> 00:21:49.330
You know, I was doing my best, but I started to do it off here and there, huh?

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.130
Yeah.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.531
I definitely did not sleep talk about castles, you know what I mean?

00:21:56.611 --> 00:21:56.971
No!

00:21:57.431 --> 00:21:59.132
Definitely no sleep talking!

00:21:59.212 --> 00:22:00.932
Definitely not, yeah.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:03.873
Dangerous.

00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:09.048
But it wasn't because I wasn't interested or it was slow or anything.

00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:09.108
No.

00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:16.711
I like this sort of stuff, you know, but... I was just so sleepy.

00:22:16.791 --> 00:22:19.012
Yeah, it was a busy day, you know.

00:22:19.112 --> 00:22:19.472
Yeah.

00:22:20.432 --> 00:22:28.955
And then... It was sad and then... I didn't cry or anything!

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:32.176
My eyes definitely are not puffy!

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:32.276
No!

00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:40.947
One moment Moco-chan sleeping next to you, and next moment there's tears streaming down her face?

00:22:41.007 --> 00:22:41.267
No.

00:22:42.148 --> 00:22:42.528
No.

00:22:44.768 --> 00:22:51.369
Well, I'm hoping that tonight, maybe, we'll be a bit more energetic.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.970
Maybe.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.070
Okay!

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.711
Because you know we have our second half of the watch along tonight.

00:22:57.731 --> 00:22:57.851
Yeah.

00:22:59.702 --> 00:23:00.702
More energy!

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:01.303
Why?

00:23:01.723 --> 00:23:02.043
Why?

00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:03.823
You didn't sleep?

00:23:04.604 --> 00:23:06.444
Ah, you didn't!

00:23:06.464 --> 00:23:06.844
You didn't!

00:23:06.984 --> 00:23:11.806
Ah, I... But you did sleep.

00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:16.527
I wonder what that means.

00:23:16.827 --> 00:23:16.987
Why?

00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:17.828
Why sleepy?

00:23:17.888 --> 00:23:18.868
Bring a pillow!

00:23:19.288 --> 00:23:21.349
Why?

00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:24.710
Actually, Moco-chan.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.631
I also need to confess to you.

00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:28.611
What now?

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:31.906
What now?

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:34.487
Why?

00:23:37.368 --> 00:23:39.809
I was really, really sleepy too!

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.491
Really, really!

00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:48.073
Yeah, but I know you know that I need to be strong since I'm the oldest sister, you know?

00:23:48.573 --> 00:23:51.814
Yeah, so that's why I let you doze off.

00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:55.016
Because I wanted to too.

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:57.176
But I didn't!

00:23:57.196 --> 00:23:58.257
I did!

00:23:58.377 --> 00:23:59.497
Okay!

00:23:59.617 --> 00:24:00.458
Ruffians!

00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:02.043
Are you proud?

00:24:02.063 --> 00:24:04.284
Are you proud?

00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:06.545
Are you proud of me?

00:24:06.885 --> 00:24:08.065
I'm not proud of you.

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.286
Be proud of me too!

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:15.247
I didn't steal Moco-chan's energy.

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:16.687
I was doing my best.

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:18.408
I stole my energy.

00:24:18.868 --> 00:24:20.589
BAU BAU!

00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:22.329
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:35.573
Well, you know, Kano is a really great, classic, legendary anime, so we'd really like it if you continue watching it along with us!

00:24:35.613 --> 00:24:43.014
We just finished off Mocoto's storyline, so I think, you know, if you jump in with us right now, it'll be fine too!

00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:53.217
Maybe, you know, we'll also have a summary for those who weren't there, or for those who dozed off like me a bit.

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.485
Doing the first part of it!

00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:55.966
Yeah.

00:24:56.306 --> 00:24:57.626
So it's okay!

00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:57.886
Okay.

00:24:57.926 --> 00:24:58.286
BAU BAU!

00:24:58.326 --> 00:25:06.109
Moco-chan, you'll do better today, right?

00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.589
I'll do my best.

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:06.869
BAU BAU!

00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:16.332
Ruffians!

00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:19.573
Does this count as another confession?

00:25:23.254 --> 00:25:25.414
Something funny is happening, Ruffians.

00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:31.516
You know, the other day, we kinda stumbled upon something strange.

00:25:32.897 --> 00:25:35.277
Ruffians, have you noticed something?

00:25:35.297 --> 00:25:39.979
Have you noticed a greeting?

00:25:41.994 --> 00:25:45.716
There's something very unnecessary.

00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:48.958
Something that shouldn't be included in it.

00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:49.838
Yeah.

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:51.899
We're a bit shocked.

00:25:52.199 --> 00:25:53.160
Yeah.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.522
You know, even a little disturbed.

00:25:57.542 --> 00:26:09.948
You know, I thought, wow, that's not the kind of thing I want to be sharing, but, well, it's been every stream we've done.

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.661
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:26:55.913 --> 00:26:58.055
Do you see?

00:26:58.515 --> 00:26:59.456
See?

00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:03.660
I'm serious!

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:11.267
There's a hidden air horn in our meeting this entire time!

00:27:11.647 --> 00:27:14.710
It's the air horn!

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.581
I can't believe it, Ruffians!

00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:24.362
We're really, really sorry!

00:27:24.962 --> 00:27:28.904
We didn't mean to be blasting the air horn at you every time!

00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:30.325
But now it's too late!

00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:31.385
We can't go back!

00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:39.788
FUWAMOCO Air Horn.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.521
Sorry, Ruffians.

00:27:42.881 --> 00:27:45.362
Now you're gonna hear it every time!

00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:49.344
You get used to it!

00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:53.366
Well, hopefully, you'll learn to love our horns.

00:27:53.786 --> 00:27:54.507
Right?

00:27:55.187 --> 00:27:55.627
Yeah.

00:27:56.248 --> 00:27:58.249
BAU BAU!

00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:59.309
Yeah.

00:27:59.649 --> 00:28:01.190
That's all we can hope for now, right?

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.291
Cuz we can't change things.

00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:03.291
We can't change it!

00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:04.752
You just have to love it now, huh?

00:28:04.772 --> 00:28:06.853
Yeah.

00:28:07.713 --> 00:28:10.215
Well, Ruffians, are you awake?

00:28:11.522 --> 00:28:12.843
Are you feeling good now?

00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:20.325
Now that you heard the air horn!

00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:21.046
I guess.

00:28:23.487 --> 00:28:24.187
Maybe.

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.568
You wanna hear from me?

00:28:27.368 --> 00:28:28.469
Air horn's not good enough?

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:31.190
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.930
Air horn good enough?

00:28:35.111 --> 00:28:35.251
Ha!

00:28:39.947 --> 00:28:40.847
Ah, it's good now.

00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:41.768
You don't want?

00:28:41.868 --> 00:28:42.168
Okay.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:43.850
Okay.

00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:46.832
Doggie of the Day time.

00:28:46.913 --> 00:28:49.735
BAU!

00:28:50.115 --> 00:28:55.620
Today's Doggie of the Day is... That.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.181
No!

00:28:56.321 --> 00:28:56.561
No!

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:56.921
No!

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:58.703
No!

00:28:58.743 --> 00:28:59.103
No!

00:28:59.123 --> 00:28:59.844
Okay.

00:29:08.641 --> 00:29:11.763
I guess it's that time then.

00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:18.166
Ruffians!

00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:22.149
It's that day of the week.

00:29:23.209 --> 00:29:24.370
It's today!

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:31.794
Today you're gonna listen up close because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:29:32.415 --> 00:29:36.297
And you're gonna hear it straight from me, Mococo!

00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:43.679
Hey!

00:29:48.223 --> 00:29:50.104
Are your eyes feeling a bit heavy?

00:29:53.047 --> 00:29:56.990
Has the cold been keeping you from getting going a bit?

00:29:58.932 --> 00:30:01.814
Have you been telling yourself, just five more minutes?

00:30:02.775 --> 00:30:05.137
A little more often than usual recently.

00:30:07.219 --> 00:30:08.220
No way!

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.160
Okay.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.821
Don't blame yourself for something that's normal, Ruffians, okay?

00:30:13.841 --> 00:30:14.361
It's dark.

00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:15.581
It's chilly.

00:30:16.101 --> 00:30:19.582
It makes sense for you to want to take some extra time to rest a bit.

00:30:20.782 --> 00:30:24.003
And you know, you should never blame yourself for needing some rest.

00:30:25.283 --> 00:30:26.204
You need to think that.

00:30:26.664 --> 00:30:30.025
Rest is a very important part of being ready for what brings you.

00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:30.105
Huh.

00:30:32.505 --> 00:30:33.005
Okay.

00:30:34.026 --> 00:30:35.846
It's not good to be constantly staying up.

00:30:37.093 --> 00:30:43.500
Sleep is important, you know, so that you can face the difficulties both physically and emotionally.

00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:58.715
So if sometimes you feel like you need a bit of a rest, you're feeling a bit bad or like you can't deal with something, maybe the best thing is to take a nap and just refresh a bit.

00:31:00.037 --> 00:31:04.319
I know balance is important, and sleep is a big part of it.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.381
So, be kind to yourself, okay?

00:31:08.062 --> 00:31:14.605
By giving yourself what you need, a balance of hard work, rest, and relaxation, okay?

00:31:16.126 --> 00:31:19.568
If you feel overwhelmed, just remember, okay?

00:31:20.489 --> 00:31:21.969
I want you to be nice to yourself.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.030
Got it?

00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:24.891
Be nice!

00:31:25.852 --> 00:31:28.173
Or, I'll bite you, okay?

00:31:29.602 --> 00:31:30.564
You wouldn't want that.

00:31:32.428 --> 00:31:32.809
So!

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.694
Let's all do our best for the rest of the week, okay?

00:31:35.714 --> 00:31:37.157
Ganbatte ne!

00:31:37.197 --> 00:31:37.598

00:31:43.707 --> 00:31:46.708

00:31:47.228 --> 00:31:49.369
You're gonna do your best today, FUWAMOCO!

00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:51.870
Ganbatte!

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.691

00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.752

00:31:56.872 --> 00:32:00.133
Next, we'll check out who's the Doggie of the Day today.

00:32:00.173 --> 00:32:03.735
Today's Doggie of the Day is... Dan!

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.015
It's Cooper!

00:32:05.075 --> 00:32:06.616
Cooper.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:10.610
Tiny.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:11.651
Tiny.

00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:12.851
Yeah.

00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:20.714
But you know, even though Cooper is a little tiny, Cooper brings a big smile to your face too.

00:32:21.414 --> 00:32:22.575
And you know what?

00:32:22.715 --> 00:32:25.436
That's what he loves to do.

00:32:26.556 --> 00:32:27.717
A dog with this like us.

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:29.197
FUWAMOCO-chan!

00:32:29.397 --> 00:32:30.678
We're the same!

00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:32.719
BAU BAU!

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:34.919
How does Cooper BAU BAU?

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.840

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.260

00:33:11.802 --> 00:33:15.964
Don't let Cooper's tiny toes fool you, okay?

00:33:16.364 --> 00:33:22.588
He's just a walkin', barkin', smilin' machine!

00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:26.230
He's a good boy and he's Ruffians his entire world too.

00:33:28.487 --> 00:33:31.790
Yeah, he just wants to make you happy.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.292
So, that's what he's going to do!

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:35.933
He's gonna do it!

00:33:35.953 --> 00:33:38.675
Especially with that little pink tongue there.

00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:40.997
And that little chocolatey nose.

00:33:41.258 --> 00:33:45.021
BAU BAU!

00:33:46.402 --> 00:33:52.026
And next for our today I went on a walk, we have De-den!

00:33:52.046 --> 00:33:52.226
Slug!

00:33:57.707 --> 00:33:58.779
All the snow.

00:34:00.709 --> 00:34:01.209
BAU BAU!

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:37.194
And today for our Question of the Day, we have De-den!

00:34:37.454 --> 00:34:38.154
Hi FUWAMOCO!

00:34:38.214 --> 00:34:47.921
There are some silly facts about different holomens about stuff they can't do, like how monsters they can't skip or sweets they can't whistle.

00:34:48.342 --> 00:34:51.444
I was curious, are there any little things you two can't do?

00:34:54.803 --> 00:34:56.084
This is a good one.

00:34:56.784 --> 00:34:59.166
There are lots of things we can't do, right?

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.867
Try not to poke yourself in the eye.

00:35:00.927 --> 00:35:03.009
Yeah, but I can't eat natto.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:04.730
I am.

00:35:05.031 --> 00:35:07.112
Slowly but surely, I can't eat cake.

00:35:07.152 --> 00:35:08.213
Right, right.

00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:09.494
If you look at it, right?

00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:11.396
But we can't touch our toes.

00:35:11.996 --> 00:35:13.737
We can't do whistle morsels.

00:35:14.838 --> 00:35:16.560
Moco-chan, you can't buzz your lips.

00:35:17.681 --> 00:35:18.561
Like warming up?

00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:18.942
Yeah.

00:35:22.346 --> 00:35:23.887
I can't do that.

00:35:24.307 --> 00:35:28.488
Poruru-oneechan was laughing at you.

00:35:29.029 --> 00:35:31.850
We can't open our eyes underwater.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.030
But I can doggy paddle.

00:35:34.651 --> 00:35:35.491
That's all I can do.

00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:37.271
I can doggy paddle!

00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:39.472
I don't know, maybe that's it.

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:43.314
It's kinda hard to think of, you know?

00:35:43.334 --> 00:35:44.815
You don't think about those things.

00:35:45.295 --> 00:35:45.675
Why?

00:35:45.715 --> 00:35:46.476
To forget them.

00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:47.477
Yeah.

00:35:48.297 --> 00:35:52.680
We like to be able to think of the positive things, but you know, we can't skip!

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.260
Yeah!

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.221
We can definitely whistle!

00:35:55.701 --> 00:35:56.082
Yeah.

00:35:56.602 --> 00:36:03.186
You know, but even though there might be some things you can't do, it's just a temporary count, right?

00:36:03.206 --> 00:36:03.926
Yeah!

00:36:04.086 --> 00:36:07.889
If you just practice and work at it, then I think you definitely can, right?

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:09.309
Just like a natto, right?

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.710
Yeah.

00:36:10.717 --> 00:36:13.899
So Ruffians, don't forget about that either, okay?

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:16.860
BAU BAU!

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.162
Thank you for such a good question!

00:36:19.182 --> 00:36:22.863
Thank you Ruffians always for all your submissions!

00:36:22.924 --> 00:36:24.384
Your Doggie of the Day!

00:36:24.444 --> 00:36:25.205

00:36:25.825 --> 00:36:28.666
Your questions, your Pero Sightings.

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:34.607
I really hope that Pero doesn't cross paths with you, but it sure seems like that's been common recently.

00:36:35.107 --> 00:36:38.588
And also, the brand new FUWAMOCO Scoop!

00:36:39.208 --> 00:36:41.269
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:43.830
Don't forget to use the hashtag!

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.310
Hashtag FWMCMorning!

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.951
And also for your FUWAMOCO Scoop, hashtag FWMCScoop.

00:36:49.991 --> 00:36:50.331
BAU BAU!

00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:58.073
As for our next stream, we have tonight.

00:36:58.534 --> 00:37:04.160
We're going to be watching the last half of the TV anime Kanon.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.683
Yesterday, as you kind of know, we watched episode 1 to 12.

00:37:06.783 --> 00:37:10.247
There was a moment where we laughed.

00:37:10.657 --> 00:37:10.837
BAU BAU!

00:37:28.175 --> 00:37:28.535

BAU BAU!

00:37:29.576 --> 00:37:33.797
And for our schedule!

00:37:33.897 --> 00:37:36.058
Let's take a look at the schedule.

00:37:36.078 --> 00:37:39.379
On Thursday we're going to be playing Power Up.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.500
It's a brand new game right now.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.641
Early access, we're going to be playing it.

00:37:43.901 --> 00:37:49.824
But not just FUWAMOCO, we're going to be playing it together with both Biboo and Shiori!

00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:53.145
We're going to check it out all for the first time together.

00:37:53.165 --> 00:37:54.986
It looks very fun.

00:37:55.266 --> 00:37:56.006
Very silly.

00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:57.998
Very silly song.

00:37:58.358 --> 00:38:00.480
We hope that you'll check it out together with us.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.323
I kind of have a good feeling about it, right?

00:38:03.584 --> 00:38:04.344
It's very silly.

00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:05.385
We're silly.

00:38:05.606 --> 00:38:08.329
Together everything's fun with Biboo and Shiori, so...

00:38:09.062 --> 00:38:10.342
Well, we'll see how it is.

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:13.003

00:38:13.503 --> 00:38:15.564

Thank you for joining us today for another FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:20.406 --> 00:38:23.426
I can't believe next episode will be episode 7.

00:38:23.927 --> 00:38:25.387
Thank you always.

00:38:26.207 --> 00:38:33.650
