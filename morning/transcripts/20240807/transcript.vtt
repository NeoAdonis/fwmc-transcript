00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.582
Why?

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.665
Why is the background like this right now?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.902
We've been working all day long, Ruffians!

00:06:45.282 --> 00:06:46.142
BAU BAU!

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:47.923

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:54.807
Wow, the barkers had a lot of time to warm up.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:58.188
But Ruffians, maybe you know you're just waking up.

00:06:58.228 --> 00:06:58.428
Yeah!

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.570
So now it's time for you to wake up!

It's just the way morning today!

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:12.174
Maybe that's the proper way to start the day today, huh?

00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:12.695
Maybe it is!

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:14.276
It's the right paw, huh?

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:17.118
But what does the right paw mean?

00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:21.441
Ruffians who are just joining us for the first time today!

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:28.006
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday!

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:29.747

It's a bit better.

00:07:53.728 --> 00:07:59.212
Sometimes you know things are just a little bit funny, huh?

00:07:59.232 --> 00:08:00.834
A little bit funny, huh?

00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:05.137
BAU BAU!

00:08:05.377 --> 00:08:10.601

00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:12.403

Only a couple days away, last one minute!

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:20.636
Moco-chan.

00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:24.258
I think the Ruffians are awake.

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:26.400
They don't need any more alarms, okay?

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.082
Yeah, I'm alarmed.

00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:30.223

Four songs!

00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:19.876

Well, maybe Ruffians, maybe FUWAMOCO.

00:10:49.709 --> 00:10:50.329
We can see it.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:11:00.896
We're lucky because, well, it launches on streaming services everywhere in your time zone at August 8th, midnight.

00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:02.558
The moment it turns August 8th.

00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:06.440
The moment it turns August 8th in your area, okay?

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.143
So look forward to it if it hasn't quite become midnight where you are.

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:12.704

It's okay.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:46.895
You know what we were thinking?

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:50.697
Maybe we can make all the Ruffians wait so we can listen to it, but... No.

00:11:51.698 --> 00:11:53.859
That would be mean, right?

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:54.940
Please enjoy!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.821
We definitely will.

00:11:57.501 --> 00:12:01.664
That's the first thing we're doing after FUWAMOCO Morning is over.

00:12:01.684 --> 00:12:03.225
We have something very exciting.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:05.369
Wow.

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:07.630
And Ruffians, you have something exciting too!

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.010
Yeah!

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.390
But!

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:08.970
But!

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.751
You know, EP is pretty exciting.

00:12:12.351 --> 00:12:19.712
But also... Just as exciting is Nerissa's 3D debut!

00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:22.233
It's coming up so soon!

00:12:22.293 --> 00:12:27.274
It's gonna be happening on August 9th at 8pm PT.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:30.795
It says three days here, but pretty much like two days now.

00:12:34.183 --> 00:12:36.708
There's some, uh, feathers.

00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.812
A little bit fluffy around the arms there.

00:12:43.072 --> 00:12:44.032
Some stripes.

00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:45.132
Yeah.

00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:48.673
Shadows.

00:12:49.193 --> 00:12:56.295
Well, I think we'll be able to see Nerissa even better on August 9th, so please make sure that you do.

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:59.196
Let's see her all lots and lots together with us.

00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:00.536
Okay, Ruffians!

00:13:01.256 --> 00:13:02.596
And then it's our turn.

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:03.657
We're so nervous!

00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:04.097
BAU BAU!

00:13:04.137 --> 00:13:04.437
BAU BAU!

00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:06.017
Go get Nerissa!

00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:12.562
BAU BAU!

00:13:13.123 --> 00:13:14.304
Oh my gosh.

00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:15.285
I'm so excited.

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:16.848
Yeah, you have it up, Ruffians.

00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:18.069
You can listen after.

00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:18.850
Or right now.

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:19.772
Or right now.

00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:20.473
You know.

00:13:20.573 --> 00:13:23.997
But I think it'd be better for you to just get the nice headphone.

00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:24.498
You know.

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:25.339
Take a moment.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:26.921
Listen to it deeply.

00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:27.182
Right.

00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:31.254
That's the way Nerissa would want you to listen to it.

00:13:31.274 --> 00:13:31.694
Actually, Moco-chan!

00:13:31.714 --> 00:13:34.175
Moco-chan, can I go get a cup of water right now?

00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:34.815
What?

00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:39.597
If I go get a cup of water, the barka will be even more rejuvenated.

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:41.077
And so will my ears.

00:13:42.298 --> 00:13:42.678
Okay.

00:13:44.638 --> 00:13:46.919
Moco-chan, you know why I wanna go get a cup of water?

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:48.560
Oh, for the water.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.200
Oh.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.861
I was confused.

00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:55.003
Why do you need your ears, huh?

00:13:55.183 --> 00:14:01.967
So I come and jubilate my ears with a nice fresh cup of Nerissa's EP!

00:14:02.468 --> 00:14:03.989
Yeah.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.650
Confusing me, huh?

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.711
Right?

00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:08.812
And maybe the moment too.

00:14:08.832 --> 00:14:09.953
BAU BAU!

00:14:10.053 --> 00:14:12.294
BAU BAU!

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:13.555
Yeah.

00:14:15.297 --> 00:14:16.277
Confused, huh?

00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:18.219
We'll listen after maybe.

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:18.659
Maybe, yeah.

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:19.619
Nerissa's EP?

00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:22.384
No.

00:14:23.444 --> 00:14:25.306
The real EP1 is... Mococo!

00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:27.947
Moco-chan.

00:14:28.647 --> 00:14:31.049
BAU BAU!

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:33.991
Well, we have some very exciting news.

00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:39.374
But today we also have some lonely news as well.

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:45.037
Our very precious senpai, Minato Akuma-senpai.

00:14:45.057 --> 00:14:50.100
She announced that she'll be graduating on the 28th of August this month.

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:59.407
Ah, you know... It's really sad, you know, that she'll be leaving after six years of her whole life here.

00:14:59.948 --> 00:15:04.953
But she's been a huge pillar to all of us and an amazing inspiration too.

00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:08.448
Yeah.

00:15:09.249 --> 00:15:16.215
We really love how cute and healing and just talented and skilled it is, AquaSempire!

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:16.296
Yes!

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:19.919
We really love her music too!

00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:23.542
You know, she does lots and lots while we're in the cells.

00:15:23.602 --> 00:15:24.043
Yeah.

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:28.725
And she also, you know, she's released a full visual novel too!

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:31.727
That's one of our huge dreams!

00:15:32.427 --> 00:15:35.489
You know, and not to mention her solo lives too!

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.631
So many amazing things Akko-senpai has done!

00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:46.054
You know, we really hope that even Akko-senpai has graduated, you know, that we can look

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:53.067
Her and all her accomplishments were inspiration and strength and growth for me too.

00:15:53.647 --> 00:15:56.748
Thank you so much, Aqua-chan-pai!

00:15:57.168 --> 00:16:01.489
We'll cheer for you until your final graduation concert comes to a close.

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:03.710
BAU BAU!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.131
Let's enjoy the time together, okay?

00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:10.892
BAU BAU!

00:16:11.692 --> 00:16:13.552
We know what's tough, what is important.

00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:20.524
Well, Ruffians.

00:16:21.165 --> 00:16:22.987
What we wanted to talk about today?

00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:24.208
August.

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.812
August, you know there's a lot of things going on in August.

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:30.956
A lot of goodbyes, but also summertime!

00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:31.756
It's summer!

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:32.317
Yeah.

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:33.579
Which means...

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:35.269
Whole Summer.

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:35.930
BINGO!

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:38.153
BINGO!

00:16:38.253 --> 00:16:38.794
BINGO!

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:39.154
Yes!

00:16:39.274 --> 00:16:39.795
Yeah!

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.076
He's back.

00:16:41.277 --> 00:16:46.383
Yeah, this year the main event is this Whole Summer BINGO!

00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:47.224
BINGO!

00:16:47.324 --> 00:16:47.845
Yeah!

00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:48.445
Yeah!

00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:50.488
We love bingo, right Ruffians?

00:16:50.548 --> 00:16:51.309
Yeah!

00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:52.791
Especially when there's fun and

00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:54.461
Prizes.

00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:55.221
Prizes?

00:16:55.261 --> 00:16:55.822
Involved.

00:16:56.022 --> 00:16:56.962
Yeah!

00:16:57.422 --> 00:16:57.942
Wow.

00:16:58.382 --> 00:16:58.983
Ruffians!

00:16:59.023 --> 00:17:00.623
The rules are simple!

00:17:00.663 --> 00:17:00.943
Yeah.

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:08.846
Ruffians, unfortunately, you can play along with us too, but I think it's more for the holo members than Ruffians, alright?

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:10.126
You probably won't get a prize.

00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:13.607
We don't know what the prizes are yet, but we believe.

00:17:13.647 --> 00:17:15.888
Let's take a look at the bingo rules!

00:17:16.408 --> 00:17:17.729
Let's take a look at the rules.

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:21.090
Cause, they were explained in Japanese.

00:17:23.787 --> 00:17:25.228
Visual stream the other day!

00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:29.231
But there wasn't too much of an explanation in English as to what the whole bingo is about.

00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:30.372
So we're gonna explain it!

00:17:30.392 --> 00:17:33.214
So the whole summer bingo rules!

00:17:33.314 --> 00:17:35.436
So there's a bingo card next to you.

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:36.036
We'll show you!

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:36.777
Bingo card!

00:17:36.797 --> 00:17:41.240
And you fill the missions the square is in by completing the missions.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:41.600
Yeah!

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.241
It's a bingo.

00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:44.682
And you get one point for each bingo.

00:17:45.143 --> 00:17:49.166
And you have from August 3rd until August 31st.

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:50.467
You have as in us.

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:50.727
Us.

00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:53.768
To complete it!

00:17:54.109 --> 00:17:59.010
And you can clear, as a FUWAMOCO, the missions in any way you'd like, you know?

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:07.853
So if you eat a watermelon, you can do a watermelon eating stream, eat a watermelon in a game, take a picture of a half-eaten watermelon.

00:18:08.273 --> 00:18:09.394
It's not that tricky.

00:18:09.474 --> 00:18:10.754
Not that complicated.

00:18:11.034 --> 00:18:12.575
Not that intense.

00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:14.435
But, uh, I say that now.

00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:16.156
But let's take a look, you know?

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:17.316
Take a look at the PC.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.457
Let's have fun.

00:18:18.517 --> 00:18:18.877
Have fun.

00:18:20.056 --> 00:18:21.737
This is the main bingo.

00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:23.897
It's a bit hard to read, so we'll read it out.

00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:24.758
Bento!

00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:26.138
Bento!

00:18:26.498 --> 00:18:27.319
Eat a bento.

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:28.559
Have a bento.

00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:30.960
Encounter a bento.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.421
Play sports.

00:18:32.801 --> 00:18:33.361
Play a sport?

00:18:34.121 --> 00:18:34.461
Easy!

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:38.203
Next one is Summer Test of Courage, which might be confusing.

00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:41.204
Something scary has to happen.

00:18:41.224 --> 00:18:42.864
You have to test your courage.

00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:44.684
And learn a new skill.

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:45.764
Learn a new skill.

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:46.985
Learn a new skill?

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:47.545
Anything.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:53.206
I was thinking that I would like to try and see how far I can kick a shoe off my foot.

00:18:54.726 --> 00:18:55.146
That!

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:59.247
I don't want to hit anyone, but that's learning a new skill, right?

00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:01.348
Is it a skill?

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:03.108
What a skill.

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:03.808
Yeah.

00:19:04.048 --> 00:19:05.669
Write a poetic verse.

00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:06.829
Yeah.

00:19:07.773 --> 00:19:07.994
Easy.

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:08.954
Flyin' from the sky.

00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:09.795
Play a retro game.

00:19:11.176 --> 00:19:11.537
Done.

00:19:11.577 --> 00:19:11.877
Done.

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:12.798
Done!

00:19:12.878 --> 00:19:13.679
We won!

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:17.182
We just, we said there was five yesterday!

00:19:17.562 --> 00:19:20.164
And unfortunately that counts as a retro game.

00:19:20.224 --> 00:19:21.405
It's a PS2 game!

00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:23.507
I don't wanna say it's a retro game!

00:19:23.527 --> 00:19:25.209
There's PS5 now.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:31.034
I don't wanna count.

00:19:31.354 --> 00:19:32.155
I don't want it to count.

00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:35.437
PS5 exists.

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:39.202
Talk about some men of his own.

00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:41.505
Conduct an experiment.

00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:45.422
On the Ruffians.

00:19:45.982 --> 00:19:47.163
On the Ruffians.

00:19:47.703 --> 00:19:48.803
Moco-chan.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:50.785
Well.

00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:52.786
Organizing events.

00:19:53.386 --> 00:19:57.128
It's something you've never tried before.

00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:59.530
Conducting investigation.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.291
On the Ruffians.

00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:04.072
How is it different from experiment?

00:20:04.492 --> 00:20:05.513
Experiment is different.

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:06.714
It's trying something.

00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:08.055
Okay.

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.035
Investigation.

00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:10.096
Serious business.

00:20:10.116 --> 00:20:10.216
Okay.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.041
Back again!

00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:16.525
Memorize all 47 prefectures of Japan!

00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:23.111
Could that have anything to do with... I wonder.

00:20:23.132 --> 00:20:25.794
We might be doing a stream kinda like that one.

00:20:26.054 --> 00:20:27.776
And then there's the free space!

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:28.977
Your summer goals!

00:20:29.017 --> 00:20:30.439
FUWAMOCO Abyssgard.

00:20:33.543 --> 00:20:34.884
Next is watch a movie!

00:20:34.924 --> 00:20:38.125
Moco-chan, you're supposed to fill it with your summer goals!

00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:39.866
Watch a movie!

00:20:41.387 --> 00:20:42.767
Yeah, it's too difficult.

00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:46.409
Start a picture diary.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.250
Eniki.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.050
Bijou.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.191
Do a leisure activity.

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:52.432
This is a hard one.

00:20:53.592 --> 00:20:55.273
What's a leisure activity?

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:57.502
We'll see!

00:20:58.463 --> 00:21:00.785
Catch insects or fish.

00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:02.467
I want to do both!

00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:05.009
I keep on looking around everywhere.

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:06.710
Is there a cicada I can catch?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.973
She keeps on telling me, Moco-chan, we have to catch some insects.

00:21:11.554 --> 00:21:12.215
Okay!

00:21:12.415 --> 00:21:13.095
Okay!

00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:14.837
Next is treat your parents.

00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.000
Very important.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.101
After that, have a collab.

00:21:21.623 --> 00:21:21.863
Done?

00:21:24.373 --> 00:21:25.634
Ruffians!

00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:26.335
Ruffians!

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:28.677
Does this count as a collab right now?

00:21:28.697 --> 00:21:31.519
Technically, yes.

00:21:36.143 --> 00:21:36.443
Yes?

00:21:37.444 --> 00:21:37.805
No?

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:38.465
No!

00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:39.346
No!

00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:40.227
What?

00:21:40.527 --> 00:21:40.967
What?

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:42.349
What?

00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:44.170
Doesn't count!

00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:48.814
We'll see, okay?

00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:50.315
Fan service.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:51.917
Skip.

00:21:52.851 --> 00:21:58.034
Sing a summery song!

00:21:58.254 --> 00:21:58.535
What?

00:21:58.815 --> 00:21:59.695
Scaming off!

00:21:59.795 --> 00:22:00.396
Okay, done.

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:02.097
Confess your sins.

00:22:02.837 --> 00:22:04.518
Skip the fanservice one.

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:06.239
Write a letter!

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.942
Okay, we write letters all the time.

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.003
Give a gift?

00:22:12.023 --> 00:22:12.503
Okay.

00:22:12.643 --> 00:22:14.384
Find or show a treasure.

00:22:15.685 --> 00:22:16.506
Pretty simple.

00:22:17.026 --> 00:22:18.427
We're working on it.

00:22:18.447 --> 00:22:19.408
Already got some done!

00:22:19.668 --> 00:22:19.828
Yeah.

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:23.373
But you know, this is the Holo Summer Bingo.

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:25.793
But this is not just the only one.

00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:29.654
There is Inferno Bingo.

00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:30.414
Inferno.

00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:32.754
So what is Inferno Bingo?

00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:35.035
Inferno Bingo is new!

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:40.836
We have a bunch of very infernal, difficult tasks here.

00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:44.317
And these ones are actually determined by us Holo members!

00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:45.097
Yeah!

00:22:45.137 --> 00:22:46.757
Yeah, we all suggested a bunch!

00:22:46.997 --> 00:22:48.418
FUWAMOCO!

00:22:48.498 --> 00:22:49.498
They suggested...

00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:51.486
Wash a dog.

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:52.206
Yeah.

00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:54.187
And bungee jumping!

00:22:54.988 --> 00:22:55.948
But we don't remember.

00:22:55.968 --> 00:22:56.889
We didn't get told.

00:22:57.629 --> 00:22:57.930
Yeah.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.851
We didn't remember suggesting them.

00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:01.091
What did we suggest?

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:04.033
And they were like... Oh my god!

00:23:04.353 --> 00:23:05.294
That's right!

00:23:05.374 --> 00:23:06.575
Yeah, so we were like, oh!

00:23:06.855 --> 00:23:08.496
What did Fuwamoco suggest?

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.337
I can't remember anymore.

00:23:10.938 --> 00:23:12.599
Wash a dog would've been nice, huh?

00:23:12.639 --> 00:23:15.801
Moco-chan, I could've just gotten you into the bathtub and... Check!

00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:16.761
Right.

00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:18.962
Twitter space in the bathtub.

00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:19.463
Done!

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.820
Well.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.021
Missed opportunity.

00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:24.422
Can't do that anymore.

00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:24.922
No.

00:23:25.082 --> 00:23:25.683
Yeah.

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:26.043
No.

00:23:26.483 --> 00:23:35.229
But the good thing about Inferno Bingo is that one bingo counts for three times the points of a regular one.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.410
Yeah.

00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:37.751
So.

00:23:38.992 --> 00:23:40.172
Inferno Bingo, good.

00:23:40.213 --> 00:23:46.197
But we have two waiting for call streams, like a call-in stream with a set theme.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.571
Lots of ideas.

00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:56.453
And then we have sent a long message of love to a hololive member.

00:23:56.513 --> 00:23:59.355
To be honest, I feel like we sort of do this often.

00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:06.218
Create a new unit.

00:24:06.418 --> 00:24:06.858
Ideas.

00:24:07.498 --> 00:24:09.819
Successfully pull off a prank.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.341
We can do that.

00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:12.921
We can do that.

00:24:14.128 --> 00:24:14.488
Advent.

00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:16.129
We're innocent, though.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.631
Yeah.

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:20.473
Feel free to decide for yourself.

00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:21.653
Free space.

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:22.534
Anything.

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:23.675
Yeah.

00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:27.137
Collab with members I don't usually interact with.

00:24:27.377 --> 00:24:33.121
Unfortunately, that's... We've only been around for one year.

00:24:33.622 --> 00:24:40.347
There's a lot of senpai we haven't collabed with, so... Unfortunately, this one's not too tricky, right?

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:45.628
Do a stream of impersonating other hololive members!

00:24:46.788 --> 00:24:49.908
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.229
Can't you say it in your voice?

00:24:51.349 --> 00:24:52.489
I can't, I can't.

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:53.409
I can.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:25:02.190
Make Italian food.

00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:03.651
Last one!

00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:06.311
Try eating insects.

00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:09.192
Why do they say try, not just eat insects?

00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:11.332
Wait, so we have to catch insects.

00:25:12.037 --> 00:25:13.278
And then we have to eat.

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:14.939
Oh!

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:17.160
Oh!

00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:18.561
We'll see.

00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:20.583
I wonder what we'll find.

00:25:21.143 --> 00:25:22.724
What will the harvest be like?

00:25:24.405 --> 00:25:30.269
Well, like we said, our goal is to get every single one of them done.

00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:36.373
They now have completely cleared both the normal bingo and the infernal bingo.

00:25:37.852 --> 00:25:40.814
And that both of us, you know, FUWAMA complete!

00:25:40.995 --> 00:25:42.135
Moco-chan complete!

00:25:42.155 --> 00:25:42.776
Exactly!

00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:46.879
So that's a lot of fun to be half Ruffians!

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.462
But like the rules said, it goes up until August 31st.

00:25:52.122 --> 00:26:00.488
Which means, really, we only have half of the month to do this before breaking the mansion.

00:26:01.068 --> 00:26:01.288
Yeah...

00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:08.093
We're gonna do our best for FUWAMOCO!

00:26:08.293 --> 00:26:14.554
One thing for sure is... We're gonna have a lot of fun together with you!

00:26:14.754 --> 00:26:17.235
BAU BAU!

00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:18.895
Let's see which one we get complete.

00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:19.375
Yeah.

00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:20.635
We'll see.

00:26:20.916 --> 00:26:21.396
BAU BAU!

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:26.317
We'll update it on Twitter, okay?

00:26:26.657 --> 00:26:29.657
Also on the community page where we get big updates.

00:26:29.997 --> 00:26:30.738
Yeah.

00:26:31.278 --> 00:26:31.918
Full bingo.

00:26:32.178 --> 00:26:32.358
Yeah.

00:26:33.327 --> 00:26:35.229
BAU BAU!

00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:38.353
And that's the hololive summer bingo!

00:26:38.573 --> 00:26:39.674
You understand the bingo?

00:26:39.754 --> 00:26:40.715
It's not that tricky.

00:26:40.795 --> 00:26:42.217
It's not that tricky.

00:26:42.597 --> 00:26:45.060
I think Beii-senpai is doing it.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.082
Beii-senpai won last year though.

00:26:47.223 --> 00:26:47.743
Right?

00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:50.586
How do we beat her, Moco-chan?

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:51.708
I don't know.

00:26:51.928 --> 00:26:53.089
Could I have the bingo?

00:26:54.303 --> 00:26:55.384
We'll have to do our best!

00:26:55.724 --> 00:26:56.364
BAU BAU!

00:26:56.684 --> 00:26:57.825
BAU BAU!

00:26:57.925 --> 00:26:58.926
You understand?

00:26:58.966 --> 00:27:00.126
Does it have to be all on stream?

00:27:00.226 --> 00:27:00.647
It doesn't!

00:27:00.727 --> 00:27:01.027
It doesn't.

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:01.667
Necessarily.

00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:02.007
No.

00:27:02.307 --> 00:27:05.129
You can upload like a photo, like a set of watermelons.

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.269
Yeah!

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:08.211
To Twitter, so like, or do it in a game.

00:27:08.411 --> 00:27:16.475
So like Italian food, technically you can make the Italian food off stream, take a photo of it, and then be like, I made Italian food!

00:27:16.575 --> 00:27:17.076
Yeah!

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:18.216
And that's clear, right?

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:18.517
Clear.

00:27:19.017 --> 00:27:19.397
Done.

00:27:19.677 --> 00:27:20.037
I know.

00:27:21.441 --> 00:27:23.002
I think it depends on everybody.

00:27:23.022 --> 00:27:24.143
What's possible for them?

00:27:24.163 --> 00:27:24.904
Games do count!

00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:26.465
It says eat a watermelon.

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:28.847
And it says you can eat a watermelon in a game.

00:27:29.307 --> 00:27:34.572
I'm smoking some heroin.

00:27:36.433 --> 00:27:37.794
Make it off-collab with Daora.

00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:45.000
But what if Daora ends up having just off-collab months when she only makes Italian food with all the food?

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.681
Right!

00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:45.761
Wow.

00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:48.799
She'll be a chef.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.021
Chef daora.

00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:50.301
Yeah!

00:27:50.561 --> 00:27:51.202
Alright.

00:27:51.602 --> 00:27:53.665
Doyoshi!

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:54.946
BAU BAU!

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:57.729
BAU BAU!

00:27:57.749 --> 00:28:00.533
There's a lot to look forward to!

00:28:01.254 --> 00:28:03.376
But, it's the middle of the week.

00:28:03.476 --> 00:28:04.898
You know, it's...

00:28:05.358 --> 00:28:09.301
Summertime is hotter, you know, maybe you're feeling a little bit beaten down.

00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:11.222
Or a little bit drained.

00:28:11.482 --> 00:28:11.842
Yeah.

00:28:12.283 --> 00:28:12.543
Huh?

00:28:13.103 --> 00:28:13.984
Moco-chan.

00:28:14.084 --> 00:28:14.324
Huh?

00:28:14.584 --> 00:28:18.907
Do you have anything to bring us back up to full energy, full power?

00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:25.037
BAU BAU!

00:28:25.857 --> 00:28:26.877
Ruffians!

00:28:27.878 --> 00:28:29.598
It's that day of the week!

00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:34.580
It's time for another one of my Mococo Pup Talks!

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.481
And you're gonna hear it straight from me.

00:28:38.021 --> 00:28:39.021
Mococo!

00:28:41.842 --> 00:28:42.463
Ruffians.

00:28:44.043 --> 00:28:46.664
Has it been a little bit rough recently?

00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:48.025
No.

00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:51.426
Maybe you're feeling a bit more emotional than usual.

00:28:52.563 --> 00:28:54.504
And it's okay to feel like that, Ruffians.

00:28:55.325 --> 00:28:59.327
It's perfectly normal and understandable, so don't beat yourself up for that.

00:29:00.327 --> 00:29:06.431
It's important to remember that nothing in life is permanent, and that's exactly why things are special to us.

00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:09.873
You know, just like a sunny day or blooming flowers.

00:29:11.213 --> 00:29:17.457
Don't be sad for what you've lost, but be happy for the good times that we've had, for all the memories that were made,

00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:26.695
Please remember that even though things might not be as they were, that there are good times ahead of you for sure.

00:29:27.335 --> 00:29:27.695
Okay?

00:29:28.436 --> 00:29:29.196
I can promise that.

00:29:30.637 --> 00:29:31.777
You just might not know yet.

00:29:33.078 --> 00:29:34.998
And it's fine to be sad for now.

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:36.559
You can take that time.

00:29:37.639 --> 00:29:44.122
But make sure to notice all the happy things going on around you during that time as well, so you don't miss them.

00:29:44.802 --> 00:29:47.824
And continue to make good memories during this time too.

00:29:49.277 --> 00:29:51.924
Remember, we're all here to support each other.

00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:52.886
Got it?

00:29:53.949 --> 00:29:55.553
Ganbatte ne!

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.297
BAU BAU!

00:29:59.702 --> 00:30:01.984
BAU BAU!

00:30:02.144 --> 00:30:07.767
Let's do our best to keep our feelings.

00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:09.888
I know what I feel like right now.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.790
I feel like I could be the Doggie of the Day after that.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.810
But I'm not.

00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:17.613
Let's see who the Doggie of the Day is today!

00:30:17.793 --> 00:30:20.594
The Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

00:30:20.854 --> 00:30:22.375
It's Kobe!

00:30:22.455 --> 00:30:22.856
Kobe!

00:30:25.377 --> 00:30:28.418
Such a sweet, quirky... Look at that tongue!

00:30:28.598 --> 00:30:30.719
That is the tongue.

00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:33.120
Bubblegum tongue.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.481
Look at the... The cheeks?

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.141
Eyebrows!

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.042
But he has the... The fluffy cheeks!

00:30:38.162 --> 00:30:39.562
I just love the muscles!

00:30:39.582 --> 00:30:40.803
I do like the eyebrows.

00:30:40.823 --> 00:30:43.264
They look like coal mines.

00:30:43.284 --> 00:30:47.946
A coal mine is silly, but it has a heart of gold!

00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:48.926
I can see it!

00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:51.447
I can see how shining that heart is!

00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:53.089
Cute!

00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:54.812
How does it call me?

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:55.734
BAU-BAU!

00:30:56.255 --> 00:30:56.876
Thank you, Sora.

00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:59.160
Sora is silly, but Sora is sweet!

00:31:00.202 --> 00:31:01.063
BAU-BAU!

00:31:01.324 --> 00:31:01.824
BAU-BAU!

00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:05.905
I love it!

00:31:05.985 --> 00:31:08.266
A fatal attitude!

00:31:08.406 --> 00:31:09.266
Yeah!

00:31:09.286 --> 00:31:10.407
BAU BAU!

00:31:10.507 --> 00:31:12.948
BAU BAU!

00:31:12.968 --> 00:31:14.148
Kobe!

00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:17.769
Kobe is just about the bestest boy ever!

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:18.269
Just about.

00:31:18.749 --> 00:31:20.250
Amazing smile!

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.190
Loves you no matter what!

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.791
Even if you don't have any traits.

00:31:29.677 --> 00:31:30.618
Shiori too!

00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:31.399
Shiori!

00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:32.240
BAU BAU!

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.983
BAU BAU!

00:31:35.003 --> 00:31:35.643
I love the cheeks.

00:31:35.683 --> 00:31:37.065
My ears are so big now.

00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:38.026
BAU BAU!

00:31:38.126 --> 00:31:38.346
And next!

00:31:44.823 --> 00:31:48.425
Ruffians, have you been having some summer adventures?

00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:50.807
Let's take a look at where you've been at!

00:31:51.207 --> 00:31:53.069
Today, I went on a walk!

00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:56.151
We have... De-den!

00:31:56.431 --> 00:31:56.631
Oh!

00:31:57.532 --> 00:31:59.313
Malfuji!

00:31:59.513 --> 00:32:01.755
Wait, you climbed on Malfuji!

00:32:02.035 --> 00:32:04.196
Together with a Ruffian buddy too!

00:32:04.236 --> 00:32:05.297
Yeah!

00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:07.158
That makes us so happy!

00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:08.259
Yeah!

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.860
Wow wow!

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.442
Not just that, you took us for the climb too!

00:32:12.462 --> 00:32:12.662
Right!

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:13.603
All together!

00:32:16.024 --> 00:32:17.886
Thank you!

00:32:18.086 --> 00:32:20.828
One of our dreams came true then!

00:32:21.228 --> 00:32:25.712
We'd really love to climb Mount Fuji ourselves one day too!

00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.513
BAU BAU!

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:29.575
Make sure you get a lot of rest okay!

00:32:29.615 --> 00:32:30.976
Rest, rest, rest, rest!

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:34.219
BAU BAU!

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:35.840
Amazing.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.082
You have to be careful on those kind of trips though too.

00:32:39.202 --> 00:32:39.623
Safety.

00:32:41.202 --> 00:32:41.863
BAU BAU!

00:32:41.963 --> 00:32:42.964
BAU BAU!

00:32:43.424 --> 00:32:43.884
And next!

00:32:43.904 --> 00:32:45.686
Moco-chan, did we get a question?

00:32:45.726 --> 00:32:51.250
For the Question of the Day, we have... DE-DEN!

00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.113
Well, I know Pero is nasty.

00:32:54.693 --> 00:32:55.274
Nasty.

00:32:55.774 --> 00:32:57.635
But his birthday is coming up.

00:32:58.056 --> 00:33:02.459
So, question other than putting, what would Pero like for a present?

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:04.961
Has Fuwamoco got him a present?

00:33:08.313 --> 00:33:10.195
Did we forget his birthday last year?

00:33:10.795 --> 00:33:12.136
He doesn't hold grudges.

00:33:12.737 --> 00:33:14.759
Why?

00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:17.781
Grudges, maybe.

00:33:18.842 --> 00:33:19.243
We'll see.

00:33:20.244 --> 00:33:27.550
But you know, I think Pero, what he wants more is for people to know that he exists, you know?

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:30.012
He's been missing for so long.

00:33:30.513 --> 00:33:34.957
So, uh, maybe he's got a bit self-conscious about that.

00:33:35.902 --> 00:33:39.224
That's just my guess though, okay?

00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:42.405
But for gifts other than pudding!

00:33:45.546 --> 00:33:49.988
Why not get him some clothing or accessories or something?

00:33:50.048 --> 00:33:53.090
I hope I don't have to wear this big thing!

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.191
I'm sure he would love that!

00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:57.972
Pero would love that.

00:33:58.032 --> 00:33:59.153
Pero would love that.

00:34:01.722 --> 00:34:01.822
Oh!

00:34:02.182 --> 00:34:02.842
A bikini.

00:34:02.882 --> 00:34:03.683
A bunch of steaks?

00:34:03.743 --> 00:34:04.863
Can you wear those steaks though?

00:34:04.883 --> 00:34:06.303
A big bow-tie of steak.

00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:07.363
What?

00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:10.024
Hamburgers!

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:13.865
I thought we were talking about clothing.

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.145
Is he gonna wear steaks?

00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:17.246
I don't know.

00:34:17.266 --> 00:34:22.647
But you know, Ruffians, more than anything, it's the thought that counts, right?

00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:24.528
So don't worry about him.

00:34:25.928 --> 00:34:26.928
Yeah, the thought.

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.589
You know, like, if you don't think of anything,

00:34:34.818 --> 00:34:45.964
That means the most.

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:46.044
Huh?

00:34:46.064 --> 00:34:48.005
This Pero's nasty.

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:48.345
BAU BAU!

00:34:48.385 --> 00:34:49.145
BAU BAU!

00:34:49.566 --> 00:34:50.046
Yeah.

00:34:50.146 --> 00:34:52.747
But let's forget about that!

00:34:53.087 --> 00:34:56.429
I wanna say a big thank you to all the Mofins!

00:34:56.809 --> 00:35:01.472
Thank you for always being a huge part of FUWAMOCO Morning here with us!

00:35:02.192 --> 00:35:09.577
Please remember, if you have a question, if you know you wanna show the world just how cute your dog is, it's gonna be the dog of the day.

00:35:09.797 --> 00:35:10.938
Your amazing walk.

00:35:11.939 --> 00:35:16.882
Please use the hashtag #FWMCMORNING, okay?

00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:17.403
Got it!

00:35:17.523 --> 00:35:17.943
BAU BAU!

00:35:18.603 --> 00:35:20.244
Bye bye!

00:35:20.464 --> 00:35:23.386
And for our next stream, we have de-den!

00:35:23.666 --> 00:35:24.807
Portal 2!

00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:26.668
Our first time!

00:35:26.908 --> 00:35:28.048
Finally!

00:35:28.088 --> 00:35:28.769
Finally!

00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:29.829
Finally!

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.511
It's a co-op game, that means we have to cooperate.

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:37.594
Hopefully that will go well because I heard there's a lot of hard puzzles.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.311
We'll see how this goes.

00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:42.052
Yeah!

00:35:42.072 --> 00:35:42.452
Yeah!

00:35:43.193 --> 00:35:43.473
BAU BAU!

00:35:43.573 --> 00:35:50.059
I don't know if we take a look at our schedule.

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:50.479
Yeah!

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.421
Wow, we have some other things.

00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:56.085
After 4.02 we have the 47 Perfections Learning Stream.

00:35:56.145 --> 00:36:04.472
Yeah, we're gonna do our best and maybe we'll get some help from some JP Ruffians who know a little bit better the map of Japan, maybe?

00:36:04.532 --> 00:36:04.733
Yeah.

00:36:06.198 --> 00:36:09.539
And then we have Nerissa's 3D debut!

00:36:09.579 --> 00:36:10.999
Yeah!

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:14.020
On Friday, August 9th at 8 p.m.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.420
PT.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.440
Don't forget!

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.981
Yeah, don't forget.

00:36:18.381 --> 00:36:24.242
And then we have, on the very next day, our 3D debut at 8 p.m.

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:24.422
PT.

00:36:28.727 --> 00:36:38.395
Everything that we worked so so so hard for, all the practice, all the tears, all the sweat, everything goes into this one big day.

00:36:38.415 --> 00:36:39.275
I hope I can sleep.

00:36:39.295 --> 00:36:40.816
I hope I can sleep.

00:36:40.896 --> 00:36:41.657
I hope I can sleep.

00:36:41.757 --> 00:36:42.478
I hope I can sleep.

00:36:43.527 --> 00:36:44.928
Please be there, my friends.

00:36:44.948 --> 00:36:47.529
Please be there to cheer us on and BAU BAU BAU!

00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:48.329
It's okay!

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:49.450
BAU BAU!

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:58.994
And then, afterwards, on the very next day at 6pm PT, we will be having a big afterparty for a 3D showcase!

00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:07.697
Please, please let us talk to you about all the stuff we've been doing, all the practice, what we did, this and that, and all.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.761
BAU BAU!

00:37:13.242 --> 00:37:15.785
Thank you so, so much, Ruffians!

00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:22.752
Thank you for being here to say hello and start your day off on the right paw again together with us.

00:37:23.573 --> 00:37:32.241
Before we say bau bau for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today and we'd also like to share

00:37:33.029 --> 00:37:37.354
The FUWAMOCO boys with the Ruffians joining us through the archive today!

00:37:37.374 --> 00:37:40.617
