04:52.603 --> 04:58.706
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!

04:59.267 --> 05:01.848

05:02.128 --> 05:04.770
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:05.090 --> 05:07.031
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:12.385 --> 05:17.187
And today, we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:17.627 --> 05:23.129

05:24.229 --> 05:24.529
1-1-1!

05:24.549 --> 05:24.809
1-1-1!

05:24.829 --> 05:24.889
1-1-1!

05:24.949 --> 05:26.530
Not 1-1-1, it's BAU BAU!

05:26.550 --> 05:27.290
BAU BAU BAU!

05:27.310 --> 05:28.490
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:36.612 --> 05:37.853
BAU BAU!

05:38.413 --> 05:39.314
Thank you!

05:39.434 --> 05:40.875
Thank you!

05:41.595 --> 05:42.976
I hope that you got a good sleep.

05:43.436 --> 05:46.498
And if you didn't, I hope you had a bunch of fun!

05:46.518 --> 05:48.599
Hopefully together with us.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.921
BAU BAU!

05:50.941 --> 05:51.961
I love oar.

05:52.342 --> 05:53.182
Yeah, I love oar.

05:53.803 --> 06:04.649
For Ruffians who are joining us for the very first time today, FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:04.669 --> 06:05.570
Today's the Monday, right?

06:08.655 --> 06:09.015
A.K.A.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.055
FUWAMOCO!

06:10.436 --> 06:13.496
Hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:13.516 --> 06:19.798
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:19.818 --> 06:25.600
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:25.920 --> 06:29.821
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:30.221 --> 06:32.862
BAU BAU!

06:33.942 --> 06:34.942
Thank you!

06:35.082 --> 06:37.323
Okay, if you thought that

06:37.763 --> 06:38.803
I don't know what day it is.

06:39.304 --> 06:40.564
Hashtag, hashtag.

06:40.624 --> 06:41.664
Hashtag, hashtag.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.865
You tell FUWAMOCO Morning what day of the week it is!

06:45.206 --> 06:45.866
It's Monday.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.546
I was just testing Moco-chan.

06:49.547 --> 06:51.528
I said, do I have a pup talk today?

06:53.468 --> 06:54.549
Do I have a pup talk today?

06:54.569 --> 06:55.309
Because I don't know!

06:57.835 --> 06:59.576
It's a Monday.

07:01.037 --> 07:07.240
We're gonna start off the week very specially because it's our first anniversary.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.882
We're gonna start the week off on the right paw all together.

07:12.763 --> 07:18.165
We're gonna make it a super fun one regardless of whether it's the weekday or the weekend.

07:18.185 --> 07:19.326
It's a big week!

07:21.728 --> 07:23.770
BAU BAU!

07:24.311 --> 07:27.034
Our first anniversary!

07:27.674 --> 07:31.298
This isn't the very first FUWAMOCO Morning.

07:31.358 --> 07:33.701
Not the day the very first FUWAMOCO Morning happened.

07:33.741 --> 07:33.981
Not yet.

07:34.061 --> 07:34.442
Soon though.

07:34.462 --> 07:34.902
Soon!

07:40.576 --> 07:40.976
Wow!

07:41.236 --> 07:41.336
Oh!

07:41.857 --> 07:42.677
It's a big week!

07:43.358 --> 07:45.819
But that doesn't mean that there isn't difficulties.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.121
Yeah.

07:48.541 --> 07:48.781
Yeah.

07:48.841 --> 07:51.022
If any week comes difficulties, right?

07:52.183 --> 07:56.285
You know, there's been... Another Pero Sighting.

07:56.506 --> 08:01.088
Difficulties like that, huh?

08:01.529 --> 08:05.091
What kind of nastiness is he getting into now, huh?

08:06.191 --> 08:06.932
Let's take a look.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.972
De-den!

08:15.790 --> 08:17.771
Is this nasty?

08:18.171 --> 08:20.713
Yeah, this looks like the best peron.

08:20.793 --> 08:21.093
No.

08:21.633 --> 08:21.793
Why?

08:22.113 --> 08:22.433
Right?

08:22.533 --> 08:22.913
Good.

08:23.274 --> 08:23.954
Good, yeah.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.855
Good is right, yeah.

08:26.135 --> 08:26.455
No.

08:26.635 --> 08:27.015
Yeah.

08:27.555 --> 08:28.876
Rest in peace, peron.

08:29.236 --> 08:30.057
No, this is good.

08:30.117 --> 08:31.357
This is the best peron.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.017
Yeah.

08:32.117 --> 08:34.398
His nastiness is just getting roasted.

08:34.539 --> 08:35.179
Right.

08:35.259 --> 08:38.240
It's becoming all gooey and sweet.

08:38.340 --> 08:39.941
Yeah, it's perfect.

08:40.021 --> 08:44.123
Yeah, you know his tune sort of changes when you have him skewered on a stick over a fire, huh?

08:44.403 --> 08:44.643
Right.

08:44.883 --> 08:45.503
Yeah.

08:46.084 --> 08:47.464
I think that happens, right?

08:47.885 --> 08:48.205
Yeah.

08:48.245 --> 08:49.546
Look at him there!

08:49.966 --> 08:51.006
Save him!

08:51.347 --> 08:53.088
I think you mean eat him.

08:53.148 --> 08:53.808
I wanna bite.

08:54.188 --> 08:55.729
I wanna bite too.

08:55.849 --> 08:56.209
Right!

08:56.229 --> 08:58.110
I much, much prefer this peron.

08:58.551 --> 09:00.572
Can't say anything nasty at all.

09:00.592 --> 09:01.452
He's burning.

09:01.812 --> 09:02.293
Yeah.

09:03.213 --> 09:04.815
What do you think, Ruffians?

09:04.855 --> 09:06.337
Fire Fire like the Pero.

09:07.519 --> 09:09.762
A bit of a different song, but sounds good.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.023
Pero oishii yone!

09:11.263 --> 09:11.864
Oishii yone!

09:11.884 --> 09:14.688
Nakami ga torotoyo!

09:15.088 --> 09:15.288
Right?

09:15.328 --> 09:17.772
The taste though, I'm pretty sure.

09:19.137 --> 09:22.160
You have to spit out the two balls in the butt.

09:22.500 --> 09:22.901
Right.

09:22.981 --> 09:25.303
It's just like the, you know, the pit of the cherry.

09:25.804 --> 09:29.007
Personality's nasty, but the flavor... Flavor?

09:29.427 --> 09:30.168
Quite roasty.

09:30.388 --> 09:30.749
Yeah.

09:31.389 --> 09:34.112
Yeah, but Ruffians!

09:35.473 --> 09:36.835
Remember this one, okay?

09:36.875 --> 09:42.561
This is what we should all strive to achieve if we ever see Pero while we're out and about, okay?

09:43.860 --> 09:44.521
Yeah.

09:44.621 --> 09:45.001
Okay.

09:45.861 --> 09:49.744
We hope you had a great camping trip!

09:49.764 --> 09:49.844
Yeah!

09:49.884 --> 09:50.625
Good memories!

09:50.705 --> 09:52.226
Hopefully other than Pero.

09:52.646 --> 09:57.049
Well, I'm sure you know, I don't think anything got in the way of you having fun!

09:57.109 --> 09:58.610
The most fun you can have!

09:58.670 --> 10:01.492
You bring a big fork so you can do this.

10:02.032 --> 10:02.813
Yeah.

10:02.933 --> 10:03.954
Just like this big thing.

10:05.943 --> 10:06.964
That's gooey, it's okay.

10:07.004 --> 10:07.724
He's lost it.

10:08.665 --> 10:10.386
If it's gooey, you won't get food poisoning.

10:10.446 --> 10:11.187
That's how it goes.

10:12.628 --> 10:15.310
BAU BAU!

10:16.010 --> 10:20.954
I don't know, that makes me want to have more summer fun, right?

10:20.974 --> 10:22.915
Mashed Pero!

10:24.076 --> 10:24.516
I don't know.

10:24.536 --> 10:24.956
I don't know.

10:25.617 --> 10:26.537
Pero poisoning?

10:26.858 --> 10:29.580
This is different from BAU BAU, Biyou, okay?

10:31.784 --> 10:32.124
Different.

10:32.144 --> 10:33.286
You have to cook it well.

10:33.726 --> 10:34.808
Exactly, exactly.

10:35.108 --> 10:37.391
I can almost smell that picture though.

10:37.571 --> 10:38.252
Right?

10:39.073 --> 10:41.616
I want to do more things like that.

10:41.716 --> 10:44.840
But we've already been having so much fun so I'm not complaining at all.

10:45.541 --> 10:48.745
And a part of that fun has been because of...

10:49.746 --> 10:51.787
Advent Anniversary!

10:52.368 --> 10:53.308
Yeah!

10:53.748 --> 10:59.031
I've been saying it almost every day, but right now it's the Summer of Advent!

10:59.372 --> 11:04.474
And you know with our anniversary and everything, we had a wonderful collab all together!

11:04.514 --> 11:06.235
We had poison gacha!

11:06.295 --> 11:08.296
Yeah, we played for each other!

11:08.717 --> 11:13.639
And I still taste natto and strawberries in my mouth, but that's a sign!

11:13.899 --> 11:14.380
We had...

11:15.280 --> 11:20.685
Advent's second original song premiere, Sirens!

11:20.825 --> 11:23.527
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

11:23.547 --> 11:24.368
Did you like it?

11:24.428 --> 11:25.328
What did you think?

11:25.348 --> 11:26.189
You listened, right?

11:26.509 --> 11:27.670
Of course, right?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.592
Many times over, right?

11:29.992 --> 11:30.933
Sirens.

11:31.113 --> 11:31.714
Sirens.

11:32.194 --> 11:32.775
Sirens.

11:33.215 --> 11:33.795
Sirens.

11:34.296 --> 11:34.896
Sirens.

11:34.996 --> 11:35.977
Not that many times.

11:36.397 --> 11:39.000
I gotta do it many times because the sirens don't stop.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.240
What's silence?

11:40.721 --> 11:44.002
You know, it's a little bit different from rebellion.

11:44.022 --> 11:45.103
How does it make you feel?

11:45.123 --> 11:49.965
It makes me feel so BAU.

11:51.226 --> 11:51.886
That's how it goes.

11:51.946 --> 11:53.407
It makes you feel so BAU.

11:53.827 --> 11:54.128
Yeah.

11:54.768 --> 11:55.028
Yeah.

11:55.348 --> 12:00.191
But, uh, silence is composed and written by James Lamdino and Morning!

12:00.251 --> 12:02.272
It's me, it's my Morning!

12:02.652 --> 12:02.872
Why?

12:02.932 --> 12:04.493
It's so fancy!

12:04.673 --> 12:05.774
And captivating!

12:05.794 --> 12:08.475
I feel like, you know, you could just be like, uh,

12:08.892 --> 12:13.934
Walking around a place with a whole bunch of like... In the... In the know!

12:14.374 --> 12:16.535
People that are up to date!

12:16.955 --> 12:19.356
You know, the fashionable people, the cool people.

12:19.376 --> 12:21.837
And they'll be like, oh yeah, what's this cool song called?

12:21.857 --> 12:22.498
Sirens.

12:22.798 --> 12:24.759
Like hololive English -Advent-.

12:24.859 --> 12:25.479
Sirens.

12:25.539 --> 12:25.899
Yeah.

12:26.159 --> 12:28.440
I wouldn't know, but... They know.

12:29.241 --> 12:31.482
And that's good because... I'm singing!

12:34.903 --> 12:37.265
It's a super stylish song!

12:38.166 --> 12:40.789
I could see us walking down the tower.

12:40.929 --> 12:44.392
The sirens, the sirens, the sirens.

12:44.953 --> 12:46.534
Did you hear that?

12:47.035 --> 12:47.295
Yeah.

12:47.335 --> 12:50.578
But you know, really really stylish.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.201
Very repeatable song.

12:53.221 --> 12:54.502
So I hope that...

12:54.942 --> 12:58.503
Ruffians that you listen to lots and lots over.

13:00.244 --> 13:02.244
It's a bit of a different style, right?

13:02.264 --> 13:03.585
Yeah, a little bit more.

13:03.985 --> 13:05.185
Different from Rebellion.

13:05.245 --> 13:06.746
Yeah, Rebellion was very catchy.

13:06.766 --> 13:08.506
Get your paws up in the air!

13:08.526 --> 13:09.427
Dance and jump!

13:09.507 --> 13:12.448
Yeah, and Sirens is like a... But sort of cool dance and jump.

13:12.468 --> 13:13.828
You make me feel so low.

13:13.848 --> 13:14.488
Kind of.

13:17.357 --> 13:18.719
So long, you know.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.462
Right, the MV was really cool, right?

13:21.622 --> 13:21.863
Yeah!

13:22.363 --> 13:26.488
Yeah, all the environments and then us, we were in the... It's so dream.

13:26.748 --> 13:27.149
So dream.

13:29.395 --> 13:30.336
Try to be cool.

13:30.476 --> 13:30.996
Yeah.

13:31.436 --> 13:37.599
You know, and especially, you know, we've never kind of sung a song like this or recorded a song like this.

13:38.039 --> 13:40.420
So it's kind of a fun new challenge for us.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.901
Oh no, yay.

13:43.242 --> 13:45.463
That part's not- It shouldn't be that hard.

13:45.523 --> 13:46.823
It shouldn't be that hard.

13:46.843 --> 13:51.145
Because when we tried recording it's... Oh no, yay.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.646
Oh no, yay.

13:52.666 --> 13:52.926
Right.

13:53.446 --> 13:57.068
It's just like... It can kind of do it, but it's like... It's not quite there.

13:57.408 --> 13:57.949
Right.

13:58.169 --> 13:58.609
Yeah.

13:59.348 --> 14:00.990
Lots of, oh no, yeah.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.432
Over and over and over and over.

14:03.452 --> 14:03.532
Yeah.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.975
That was taking place, that was all the time.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.517
Not the time now.

14:08.597 --> 14:13.141
This is FUWAMOCO Morning, okay?

14:13.522 --> 14:19.027
I did see a number of Ruffians being like, Fuwawa can sound like that!

14:19.147 --> 14:20.528
Ruffians!

14:22.869 --> 14:25.212
That's just me singing a song in karaoke.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.635
I sing songs like that normally too.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.777
I don't know what you're surprised about.

14:29.817 --> 14:33.681
Have your ears been not working this whole time?

14:33.741 --> 14:34.983
But I'm happy.

14:35.083 --> 14:43.332
I'm really really so happy to be able to sing another original song together with Alice.

14:43.952 --> 14:45.453
It took us a little while.

14:45.513 --> 14:46.414
Have you noticed it?

14:46.434 --> 14:48.975
I don't think I have not seen a single mention of this.

15:13.262 --> 15:14.703
Once you hear it, you can't un-hear it.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.564
Yeah.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.024
Honest, that's the only thing- Moco-chan!

15:20.044 --> 15:20.545
No hints!

15:20.705 --> 15:21.165
No hints!

15:21.205 --> 15:22.265
They have to discover it!

15:22.285 --> 15:22.805
I want a hint!

15:22.825 --> 15:24.626
I want a- I want a hint.

15:24.766 --> 15:25.506
No, no, no, no.

15:25.586 --> 15:25.986
No hints!

15:26.086 --> 15:26.407
No hints!

15:26.547 --> 15:27.007
No hints!

15:27.107 --> 15:28.988
I don't think anyone said anything!

15:29.008 --> 15:29.928
I want to ruin it!

15:29.948 --> 15:31.808
No, no, they have to discover it!

15:31.828 --> 15:32.989
They have to discover it!

15:35.089 --> 15:35.969
They have to discover it.

15:36.050 --> 15:36.570
Listen more.

15:36.590 --> 15:37.790
Okay!

15:38.310 --> 15:39.851
BAU BAU!

15:42.031 --> 15:43.912
You have to listen carefully, okay?

15:43.952 --> 15:46.773
We have to repeat it a lot, okay?

15:46.793 --> 15:53.795
There is also a special anniversary!

15:54.355 --> 15:56.436
Look at the illustration we have!

15:56.916 --> 15:57.156
BAU BAU.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.638
A bunch of different things, but first we have a rubber mat!

16:01.218 --> 16:04.160
The illustration's done by Marumoru-sensei!

16:04.220 --> 16:05.640
Thank you!

16:07.922 --> 16:09.683
Don't sneeze during the party, okay, Moco-chan?

16:09.703 --> 16:14.125
But look, we're all having a party and Nerissa has a full cake just for you!

16:14.245 --> 16:15.746
It's like, oh, you're an Adventrix?

16:15.886 --> 16:17.047
Okay, you can buy a cake.

16:17.087 --> 16:18.688
You have a full cake.

16:18.708 --> 16:19.268
Yeah, Moco-chan!

16:19.388 --> 16:22.570
I don't know, you're gripping that parfait there.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.291
You're like, this is my parfait.

16:24.391 --> 16:25.711
I'm not gonna let it go.

16:25.771 --> 16:26.832
I'll let you have a bite.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.479
And I'm about to take a bite of a strawberry.

16:29.499 --> 16:32.361
So many sweets!

16:33.142 --> 16:41.247
Ruffians, you know, maybe you want to have a rubber mat because if you sneeze on it, it's a little bit easier to clean, right?

16:41.347 --> 16:43.609
They spill crepes and desserts.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.250
Then you know, it's good.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.530
And then, next!

16:46.911 --> 16:50.633
We have the button badge with case.

16:51.073 --> 16:53.655
It's not just like a normal button badge.

16:53.835 --> 16:54.696
It has a case.

16:55.336 --> 17:04.063
Yeah, so you can keep it nice and safe, and you know, this means that it'll look perfect with an ita bag.

17:04.083 --> 17:08.766
You know, you have your ita bag, and then you're like, oh, I kind of want to put, like, something else on the outside.

17:09.106 --> 17:15.971
Then you can do that, and maybe you're like, oh, I have a badge, a button badge I especially, especially like.

17:16.692 --> 17:17.592
I want to keep it safe.

17:17.692 --> 17:20.034
This is the perfect thing for that.

17:20.534 --> 17:20.675
So.

17:21.395 --> 17:25.177
I hope that maybe you think about that, especially if you like Maki Itabai.

17:25.217 --> 17:25.337
Yeah!

17:25.517 --> 17:28.739
Or you just like, you have a special badge that you really want to get.

17:28.759 --> 17:29.999
Really like, I get that.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
I get that too.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.901
This is the perfect thing for that.

17:34.202 --> 17:34.882
Yeah!

17:35.162 --> 17:36.303
And not just that!

17:36.563 --> 17:38.824
We also have the pin badge!

17:38.964 --> 17:43.026
I feel like, you know, Rikuo has a pin badge.

17:43.066 --> 17:43.446
Right!

17:43.566 --> 17:45.447
Justice has a pin badge.

17:45.567 --> 17:46.668
She's got a pin badge.

17:47.029 --> 17:48.513
Here we go, we're one year late.

17:48.874 --> 17:52.446
But that's okay because we can celebrate our first anniversary together!

17:52.466 --> 17:54.071
We're one year late to the party.

17:55.521 --> 17:56.422
It's our party.

17:56.622 --> 17:56.922
Yeah.

17:56.962 --> 18:02.146
But see, you could also put this advent pin that's on your itabag if you wanted to.

18:02.226 --> 18:06.169
Yeah, and next, we have the motif keychain.

18:06.189 --> 18:06.789
Yeah.

18:07.209 --> 18:09.171
I really like ours, it's very cute.

18:09.271 --> 18:12.413
I'm not sure, you know, we have little wings there.

18:12.673 --> 18:14.935
But you could put the keychain on your keychain.

18:14.975 --> 18:15.856
Right, you could.

18:15.896 --> 18:16.236
With the keys.

18:16.336 --> 18:22.100
Especially, you know, I'm sure it'd match very well with our half-anniversary keychains if you want to.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.022
I really want one for keys, too.

18:25.264 --> 18:27.006
BAU BAU!

18:27.186 --> 18:36.196
And that is our anniversary celebration merch!

18:36.296 --> 18:38.859
They're on sale right now, Ruffians!

18:39.179 --> 18:41.562
So if you're interested, please check them out!

18:41.942 --> 18:44.004
Sales end in September, so...

18:46.609 --> 18:48.430
Let's make a decision sometime.

18:48.690 --> 18:48.930
But!

18:49.911 --> 18:51.532
I know we talked about it recently.

18:51.552 --> 18:51.812
Yeah.

18:52.252 --> 18:55.635
This is separate from our anniversary merch.

18:55.995 --> 18:56.135
Yeah.

18:56.315 --> 18:57.356
Which is coming out soon.

18:57.616 --> 19:00.898
And it's gonna be a bit of a battle, I think.

19:00.978 --> 19:03.459
Yeah, there's so many exciting things, you know.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.400
Summertime!

19:05.441 --> 19:07.061
Summer of Advent!

19:07.122 --> 19:09.463
And you know, it's similar to our birthday merch.

19:09.883 --> 19:14.846
Because it's stuff that we thought about and worked really hard to make!

19:14.866 --> 19:15.847
So that, you know,

19:17.541 --> 19:17.761
Ruffians!

19:17.781 --> 19:17.841
So...

19:31.382 --> 19:33.003
Don't get excited out, okay?

19:34.104 --> 19:36.345
BAU BAU!

19:36.705 --> 19:40.367
And also another part of the Summer of Advent.

19:40.687 --> 19:43.089
We're taking over the Twitter.

19:43.309 --> 19:46.130
We're taking over the Instagram.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.091
As you know.

19:47.511 --> 19:48.232
It's Advent.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.193
Yeah, we're rebelling.

19:50.213 --> 19:55.075
Yeah, with a bunch of photos of our activities we've been doing over the summer.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.257
Behind the scenes, you know.

19:57.997 --> 20:04.740
Yeah, look at us all at the airport where we picked up Shiori, Biboo, and Nerissa!

20:04.960 --> 20:07.821
Just some casual clothes, because you know, it's the airport.

20:07.881 --> 20:10.983
You don't get all dressed up for it.

20:11.003 --> 20:16.966
But there'll be a lot more coming soon, so please look forward to them too!

20:17.106 --> 20:19.127
And we're gonna take it over!

20:19.187 --> 20:21.648
So look forward to seeing us on our off time.

20:22.948 --> 20:25.029
BAU BAU!

20:25.049 --> 20:29.231
But it's not just the summer of Advent!

20:29.271 --> 20:29.931
No!

20:30.472 --> 20:34.113
A senpai released a brand new song cover!

20:34.233 --> 20:35.013
Yeah!

20:35.053 --> 20:37.014
Kanata-senpai!

20:37.094 --> 20:40.136
Kanata-senpai released a cover of Igaku!

20:40.216 --> 20:42.657
A song by Kasane Teto!

20:42.717 --> 20:44.077
Mocoboi!

20:44.117 --> 20:44.938
She wrote it herself.

20:44.958 --> 20:44.998
No!

20:45.018 --> 20:49.720
Mocoboi is a pretty amazing boy.

20:50.487 --> 20:53.031
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.731
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:28.277 --> 21:29.519
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:29.539 --> 21:30.700
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

21:48.361 --> 21:49.784
BAU BAU!

22:02.121 --> 22:03.362
BAU BAU!

22:03.622 --> 22:07.543
Yeah, Kanata-senpai is such a good singer too.

22:07.563 --> 22:10.404
There's so many senpai that are amazing at singing.

22:10.564 --> 22:12.465
Oh, but speaking of senpai.

22:12.665 --> 22:12.805
Oh!

22:13.185 --> 22:18.367
We also did the... Anishina's Family Feast!

22:18.487 --> 22:19.588
BAU BAU!

22:19.628 --> 22:21.308
Thank you much!

22:21.468 --> 22:22.789
That was chaotic, huh?

22:24.308 --> 22:29.210
It was so much fun, right?

22:29.490 --> 22:30.890
Yeah, I love Spelling.

22:30.930 --> 22:31.751
You love Spelling?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.811
I actually do like Spelling a lot.

22:34.412 --> 22:39.533
But Ame-senpai, Gura-senpai, they prepared so much.

22:39.573 --> 22:41.374
We became puppets!

22:41.954 --> 22:44.375
And then we had to spell all of a sudden.

22:44.775 --> 22:49.537
It was kind of funny because the words that they kept on giving us to spell kind of felt kind of...

22:51.087 --> 22:51.567
Arranged.

22:52.447 --> 22:54.248
I'm just happy I didn't get necessary.

22:54.968 --> 22:55.208
Me too.

22:56.008 --> 22:56.168
Yeah.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.589
Necessary, I would be done.

22:57.649 --> 22:59.189
That's one of the words I just can't spell.

22:59.209 --> 22:59.809
Necessary, no.

23:00.350 --> 23:00.470
Yeah.

23:00.530 --> 23:03.030
I spelled it so poorly that spellcheck can't help me.

23:03.190 --> 23:03.590
Yeah.

23:03.630 --> 23:06.431
So... But it was a lot of fun.

23:06.491 --> 23:08.132
We learned a lot about spelling.

23:08.432 --> 23:08.932
Yeah!

23:08.952 --> 23:10.912
I got to spell Sprinkle!

23:11.192 --> 23:11.252
Ah!

23:11.272 --> 23:12.213
Amoco-chan!

23:12.233 --> 23:12.893
Pterodactyl!

23:12.953 --> 23:14.473
You spelled Pterodactyl!

23:14.593 --> 23:15.474
Yeah!

23:15.754 --> 23:18.434
Ruffians as a side note, is it spelled or spelled?

23:18.714 --> 23:19.695
I spelled the word.

23:19.715 --> 23:20.675
I spelled the word.

23:23.342 --> 23:23.762
It's an apple.

23:23.782 --> 23:25.303
I spelled the word.

23:25.924 --> 23:29.546
And I got to spell, you know there's words like restaurant.

23:29.586 --> 23:31.528
People are always like, oh restaurant.

23:31.848 --> 23:33.749
Restaurant.

23:34.069 --> 23:35.330
R-E-S-T-E-R-A-U-N-T.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.311
No, no, it's restaurant.

23:37.532 --> 23:38.192
Restaurant.

23:38.212 --> 23:39.373
I got to spell refrigerator.

23:39.433 --> 23:39.613
Yes!

23:39.673 --> 23:43.015
And you know refrigerator is kind of like that one too.

23:43.095 --> 23:48.219
You spell it F-R-I-D-E-G-A-T-O-R.

23:48.939 --> 23:49.680
Fridgerator.

23:51.978 --> 23:55.241
You know, there's a lot of different things in the fridge.

23:55.741 --> 23:58.643
The gated is the important part to spell refrigerator.

23:58.683 --> 24:00.145
Hopefully there's stuff in the fridge.

24:00.325 --> 24:01.726
Yeah.

24:02.306 --> 24:03.867
And, wow.

24:04.048 --> 24:06.970
Everyone was really really good at spelling.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.931
I was doing well too.

24:09.092 --> 24:12.414
So well that I ended up on fire.

24:13.175 --> 24:14.336
But it was okay!

24:14.696 --> 24:20.401
Because, well, we might not have won in the end, right Moco-chan?

24:20.441 --> 24:20.661
No.

24:21.497 --> 24:24.219
But, you know, Gigi took that.

24:24.239 --> 24:27.322
Gigi took that, and she got all the spelling right.

24:27.402 --> 24:28.263
Okay, Shiori.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.604
Okay, okay.

24:29.644 --> 24:30.584
Is that fancy?

24:30.925 --> 24:33.607
But we wanted the L, Ruffians.

24:33.647 --> 24:41.173
Because we made you, and I think you know, the most hololisters, smile!

24:41.693 --> 24:44.876
And that's more important than the spelling.

24:44.916 --> 24:45.356
You know!

24:46.197 --> 24:48.599
This world is filled with a thing called spellcheck.

24:48.859 --> 24:51.061
Spellcheck exists for a reason.

24:51.121 --> 24:52.883
But is there a thing called smilecheck?

24:53.363 --> 24:54.084
No!

24:54.624 --> 24:58.187
I guess a doctor's kind of... A doctor-dentist is kind of a smilecheck.

24:58.207 --> 24:58.447
No.

24:58.787 --> 24:58.968
No.

24:59.468 --> 24:59.648
No.

25:00.149 --> 25:00.669
FUWAMOCO!

25:00.909 --> 25:01.550
Yeah!

25:01.850 --> 25:02.150
We won!

25:02.671 --> 25:05.673
We won the Fumi-summing L.E.B.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.515
Wait, did you go to kisses?

25:08.716 --> 25:13.720
Ruffians, if you think I asked for kisses, you think I won't get them?

25:16.216 --> 25:20.318
That's true, we didn't ask Ame-senpai and Rina-senpai for kisses.

25:21.279 --> 25:21.639
Right.

25:21.839 --> 25:25.941
I guess, you know, maybe Gigi... Maybe that's like a good point.

25:25.981 --> 25:28.723
A difficult thing for her.

25:29.163 --> 25:36.828
I could just go... Ame-senpai... Can I have a kiss?

25:39.245 --> 25:44.270
Ko-chan, if you added a BAU BAUer here, then it might help.

25:44.870 --> 25:45.771
Ame-senpai!

25:46.712 --> 25:50.835
Can I have a kiss?

25:51.656 --> 25:53.958
Do you think she would like that?

25:54.538 --> 25:55.579
I think she would.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.061
Yeah, Gigi has to work hard.

25:58.081 --> 26:00.403
FUWAMOCO, we can just ask.

26:01.244 --> 26:01.764
BAU BAU!

26:02.905 --> 26:03.246
Yeah.

26:08.918 --> 26:09.939
Ame!

26:10.219 --> 26:13.021
Ame would never refuse that right!

26:13.582 --> 26:15.783
Yeah.

26:16.524 --> 26:18.545
BAU BAU!

26:19.186 --> 26:20.446
From Kurina-senpai.

26:20.907 --> 26:24.729
We don't need a kiss, but we do need to kinda munch on the tail.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.511
Maybe not munch, but a slap?

26:28.012 --> 26:28.392
A slap?

26:28.672 --> 26:31.294
I feel like it'd be very gummy.

26:31.754 --> 26:34.797
I would like to just... Ino-senpai's tail!

26:35.805 --> 26:36.305
Tail.

26:36.325 --> 26:37.306
Ah, arms.

26:37.746 --> 26:39.007
They're arms, thank you.

26:39.027 --> 26:40.368
I wanna eat those.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.230
Gura-senpai's tail.

26:42.550 --> 26:44.091
Probably very salty.

26:44.732 --> 26:45.772
I could just get slapped by that.

26:45.792 --> 26:46.933
It'd be like... Otsumami.

26:48.514 --> 26:49.575
I wanna dry it out.

26:49.595 --> 26:51.917
Otsumami!

26:52.057 --> 26:55.059
BAU BAU!

26:55.079 --> 26:58.662
If you keep on talking about food, the muffins are gonna get you more hungry.

27:01.799 --> 27:02.800
Ruffians!

27:03.200 --> 27:06.422
You know, we had some bad news with Pero.

27:06.442 --> 27:08.083
But we have some good news!

27:08.103 --> 27:13.546
FUWAMOCO, we just reached 900,000 subscribers on YouTube!

27:13.666 --> 27:18.949
We're done, I'm V. V.

27:21.409 --> 27:22.370
BAU BAU!

27:42.294 --> 27:50.301
You know, FUWAMOCO on the DVD, we had a big goal of 1 million subscribers.

27:50.321 --> 27:54.405
1 million subscribers by our first anniversary.

27:54.805 --> 27:58.629
And you know, I kind of have a feeling that within

27:59.977 --> 28:00.558
Two days?

28:01.198 --> 28:02.860
We can't get to 1 million subs.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.742
But that doesn't mean that we're gonna stop trying.

28:05.043 --> 28:05.303
No.

28:07.045 --> 28:13.812
And we're gonna continue to work hard until we reach that!

28:14.093 --> 28:16.275
Until we reach that!

28:16.295 --> 28:21.320
But you know, even though we had the goal of 1 million by our anniversary,

28:22.654 --> 28:23.635
That's not everything.

28:23.655 --> 28:24.116
Yeah.

28:24.356 --> 28:27.299
You know, we've always said it's the journey that matters.

28:27.359 --> 28:28.280
It's not the goal.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.201
And it's a goal.

28:29.601 --> 28:32.304
It's a lofty, big, big goal.

28:32.404 --> 28:33.866
That's because we're hungry!

28:33.906 --> 28:34.487
Yeah!

28:34.567 --> 28:36.389
And we still have that goal.

28:36.669 --> 28:41.995
So you know, even if we don't quite reach it in time, that doesn't mean that we're never gonna reach it.

28:42.055 --> 28:42.155
No.

28:43.055 --> 28:48.657
So, we're gonna continue to go on this journey together, you Ruffians!

28:48.697 --> 28:51.178
That's how you should think about things too, okay Ruffians?

28:51.238 --> 28:54.360
We're gonna do it the FUWAMOCO way, you know?

28:54.780 --> 29:02.703
If we, you know, run and run and run and hurt ourselves and go kinda crazy trying to get to 1 million, that's not right.

29:03.403 --> 29:08.926
No, it's the journey, so we're gonna continue on this journey together with you Ruffians!

29:08.986 --> 29:18.150
You know, you aim for the moon, you end up in the stars, and that's exactly where we are with you Ruffians, so thank you so much!

29:18.210 --> 29:20.451
I'll continue to do my best here!

29:21.359 --> 29:23.200
Past our first year anniversary.

29:23.920 --> 29:27.341
Past maybe 1 million subscribers.

29:27.581 --> 29:28.741
And on and on and on.

29:29.441 --> 29:33.402
Thank you!

29:33.422 --> 29:35.143
BAU BAU!

29:35.163 --> 29:37.864
I think we have a very cute doggy waiting for us.

29:37.904 --> 29:38.884
FUWAMOCO-chan.

29:39.504 --> 29:43.885
Today's Doggie of the Day is... De-den!

29:44.025 --> 29:46.086
It's Tyson!

29:47.166 --> 29:50.410
FUWAMOCO Morning deshita.

30:04.426 --> 30:11.249
Yeah, and you know, even though he's 13, you know, maybe he's a little small, a little older.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.489
He's fierce!

30:12.789 --> 30:14.050
Tyson's fierce!

30:14.370 --> 30:14.630
Fierce.

30:14.670 --> 30:14.990
Yeah.

30:15.590 --> 30:18.571
And I'm not quite sure, do you see that tree there?

30:18.591 --> 30:19.452
In the back?

30:19.572 --> 30:21.893
In the back there, you see how it's kind of like... Ouch!

30:23.033 --> 30:24.014
There's a chunk missing.

30:24.554 --> 30:26.334
You know, who did that?

30:27.475 --> 30:27.795
Tyson.

30:28.155 --> 30:29.496
He's responsible for that.

30:30.216 --> 30:31.076
Very strong.

30:31.216 --> 30:31.636
Fierce.

30:32.157 --> 30:32.557
Yeah.

30:33.788 --> 30:36.230
Moco-chan, how do you think Tyson BAU BAU?

30:36.250 --> 30:45.617
Well, if he can take down a tree, then I... That's exactly what I was imagining too.

30:46.138 --> 30:47.379
That's him taking down a tree.

30:47.459 --> 30:50.221
But what if it was like a longer BAU, like a BAAA.

30:55.975 --> 31:04.765
BAU BAU!

31:05.106 --> 31:14.357
I think you know, we can both say that Taisen has been doing an amazing job at not just protecting this Ruffian's smile, but also this Ruffian's body.

31:15.237 --> 31:19.559
And you know, I did such a good job at making this Ruffian feel safe.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.341
Nothing scares Tyson, not even trees.

31:22.361 --> 31:23.621
He'll take down the trees.

31:24.081 --> 31:26.302
If there's any scary ones, you know, in the middle of the night.

31:26.383 --> 31:27.803
I bet he'll even take down rocks too.

31:27.923 --> 31:28.464
We don't know.

31:28.504 --> 31:29.324
Don't tell Biboo.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.966
BAU BAU!

31:34.166 --> 31:37.648
Next Ruffian, where have those paws been going, huh?

31:38.048 --> 31:39.489
Let's take a look at today.

31:39.669 --> 31:40.909
I went on a walk.

31:40.969 --> 31:41.950
We have dad.

31:43.019 --> 31:46.322
It's a beautiful picture.

31:46.342 --> 31:50.526
I didn't fall over the edge or anything right.

32:08.063 --> 32:13.045
I hope that you enjoyed the fresh mountain and that it wasn't too hot out.

32:13.825 --> 32:15.166
Just fresh, just fresh.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.047
Fresh and cool, that's it.

32:17.427 --> 32:19.748
Underneath the FUWAMOCO skies.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.240
BAU BAU!

32:23.601 --> 32:28.542
Please continue traveling, visiting things, but being safe, okay?

32:29.302 --> 32:30.502
BAU BAU!

32:30.782 --> 32:35.563
And our Question of the Day is... De-den!

32:36.063 --> 32:37.304
Good day, FUWAMOCO!

32:37.324 --> 32:38.464
Good day!

32:38.884 --> 32:51.027
Q. If FUWAMOCO equals BAU BAU, Biboo equals ROCK RCOK, Nerissa equals OPE OPE, Shiori equals

32:51.567 --> 32:52.409
Question question...

32:54.151 --> 32:54.531
Wow.

32:56.976 --> 33:03.260
You know, recently, Shiori kind of said something in repetition quite a bit.

33:03.801 --> 33:05.562
And that's "THERE THERE".

33:05.882 --> 33:06.843
THERE THERE!

33:07.183 --> 33:09.084
"Oh, FUWAMOCO, there, there."

33:09.385 --> 33:10.125
THERE THERE!

33:10.205 --> 33:15.789
Yeah, I even have messages to Shiori being like... Shiori's like "there, there."

33:15.909 --> 33:21.192
You know, when we were on our trip, I was trying to help, but...

33:22.644 --> 33:23.905
Boog boog.

33:23.925 --> 33:24.005
No.

33:50.015 --> 33:50.595
Book book.

33:51.035 --> 33:52.896
There there.

33:52.936 --> 33:53.897
What's other things?

33:55.397 --> 33:57.218
What's other things Shiori says?

33:59.399 --> 34:00.079
Crazy stuff.

34:00.099 --> 34:00.839
Snip snip.

34:01.080 --> 34:01.340
No.

34:01.420 --> 34:02.080
Snip snip.

34:02.180 --> 34:02.400
No.

34:03.100 --> 34:03.641
There there.

34:04.341 --> 34:04.561
Yeah.

34:04.901 --> 34:05.441
There there.

34:06.182 --> 34:08.443
BAU BAU!

34:08.523 --> 34:10.063
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

34:10.143 --> 34:11.104
Thank you!

34:11.384 --> 34:16.526
I am so so certain that you want to be a part of FUWAMOCO Morning, right Ruffians?

34:16.566 --> 34:16.926
Right.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.507
You do, right?

34:18.547 --> 34:18.887
You do.

34:19.727 --> 34:24.851
As your part of FUWAMOCO Morning, just being here and commenting and cheering us on.

34:25.171 --> 34:35.218
But you can be an even bigger part of FUWAMOCO Morning by using the hashtag FWMCMORNING and sending us your Doggie of the Day.

34:35.298 --> 34:36.539
So what if you don't have a doggy?

34:36.860 --> 34:38.120
I'm sure you have a question.

34:38.140 --> 34:39.581
You can send us your question.

34:39.602 --> 34:41.303
You can become the Question of the Day.

34:41.743 --> 34:43.983
You know, going on a walk is always good.

34:44.263 --> 34:46.304
Go on a walk, show us what you saw.

34:46.464 --> 34:49.344
See something funny, take a photo.

34:49.764 --> 34:55.145
Maybe you're even tidying up around the house and you see Pero, unfortunately.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.746
Let us know, send us a photo, okay?

34:58.126 --> 34:59.846
Just don't forget the hashtag.

35:00.286 --> 35:01.886
Hashtag FWMCMORNING!

35:02.046 --> 35:03.527
Okay, Ruffians!

35:03.867 --> 35:07.627
You can be a big part, okay?

35:07.687 --> 35:09.008
We're waiting!

35:09.228 --> 35:10.568
BAU BAU!

35:11.288 --> 35:16.473
And for our next stream, we have... De-den! ARK!

35:16.673 --> 35:24.220
We're going to be continuing to play hololive ARK, the holo ARK, together with our senpai right now!

35:24.300 --> 35:26.582
There's a special event going on with the game ARK.

35:26.982 --> 35:31.286
It's the very first time, we just played it for the first time just a couple minutes ago together.

35:32.527 --> 35:36.609
We are now mother to two dinosaurs and a buddy.

35:37.909 --> 35:42.771
But we survived the raid somehow with the help of our wonderful senpai.

35:42.831 --> 35:44.752
So we'll continue to do our best.

35:45.192 --> 35:50.734
Unfortunately, this event you know, a lot of it's run by our JP senpai.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.115
So naturally, it has

35:52.235 --> 35:53.856
FUWAMOCO Morning!

35:53.936 --> 35:55.577
FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru!

36:16.388 --> 36:19.129
Well, you can pick really early or you can pick really late.

36:19.789 --> 36:21.010
It's a countdown, right?

36:21.050 --> 36:25.731
We wanted to spend the very first moment of our second year together with you.

36:25.751 --> 36:26.991
I'm quitting time.

36:27.111 --> 36:31.313
You know we wanted to talk about a bunch of different things and maybe talk with some...

36:32.013 --> 36:33.974
Senpai we haven't been able to talk with before.

36:33.994 --> 36:36.554
Also senpai we've only chatted with a little bit.

36:36.574 --> 36:38.975
So we're really looking forward to it.

36:39.035 --> 36:39.615
Ruffians!

36:39.635 --> 36:39.835
Moi!

36:39.995 --> 36:40.375
BAU BAU!

36:40.415 --> 36:40.596
And!

36:40.716 --> 36:41.536
BAU BAU!

36:41.856 --> 36:44.277
Also take a look at our schedule!

36:44.297 --> 36:46.337
Our anniversary!

36:46.477 --> 36:48.578
It's on the 31st.

36:49.158 --> 36:50.738
July 31st.

36:51.018 --> 36:52.899
Starting we have, you know, we have FUWAMOCO Arc.

36:52.939 --> 36:54.019
We have FUWAMOCO Morning.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.400
But that's not just it!

36:55.420 --> 36:55.980
That's not it.

36:56.580 --> 36:59.442
We have our first anniversary celebration.

36:59.482 --> 37:02.904
It starts at 10am PT.

37:02.984 --> 37:07.147
10am JST or 6pm PT.

37:07.688 --> 37:10.950
And you know, we're gonna be doing a bunch of different things.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.291
You know.

37:12.931 --> 37:13.231
What?

37:13.612 --> 37:15.893
Some singing.

37:15.953 --> 37:16.954
Some watching.

37:16.994 --> 37:18.575
Reflecting.

37:18.635 --> 37:19.455
Talking.

37:19.596 --> 37:21.777
All the things that FUWAMOCO loves to do.

37:22.337 --> 37:23.018
And then,

37:24.457 --> 37:26.679
8.30pm PT.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.841
We have another thing there.

37:29.722 --> 37:32.444
But, I don't know, I think our file got corrupted.

37:32.464 --> 37:33.905
It's kind of blurry.

37:33.925 --> 37:36.627
Sorry about that.

37:36.927 --> 37:39.810
But, I think this is kind of the most exciting thing.

37:40.150 --> 37:43.353
I don't know, Ruffians, why do you think Foggs is the most exciting?

37:44.325 --> 37:45.666
Please don't make me sad.

37:46.246 --> 37:48.947
Moco-chan's gonna cry, okay, Ruffians?

37:49.027 --> 37:50.528
Please don't make me sad.

37:50.648 --> 37:50.988
Yeah.

37:51.548 --> 37:54.650
Let it fog so much we couldn't play it any other time, okay?

37:57.248 --> 38:01.792
So please join us for our first anniversary!

38:02.032 --> 38:08.936
And then we'll also do some chatting, certainly after that at 8.45 p.m. PT, OK?

38:08.977 --> 38:09.579
Yes!

38:09.880 --> 38:13.272
And then you know we have a whole bunch of other things that are all really, really exciting, but!

38:13.935 --> 38:18.692
Over on Shiori and Bebe's channel, they're making their 3D debut!

38:19.736 --> 38:19.856
Yes!

38:20.388 --> 38:22.669
You can't miss it, okay, Ruffians?

38:22.729 --> 38:23.709
You just can't.

38:24.630 --> 38:33.172
It's a huge deal, and we're looking forward to it so much, so please be there to celebrate this big 3D debut!

38:33.493 --> 38:34.893
BAU BAU!

38:34.913 --> 38:39.975
Are you supposed to be surprised about some hidden mysterious pixels?

38:40.415 --> 38:40.735
Yes!

38:41.375 --> 38:42.596
Because it's a mystery.

38:44.936 --> 38:49.218
If there's a mystery, Ruffians, you have to be excited for the mystery.

38:50.283 --> 38:53.486
Would've been more exciting if we were question, question, question like on it.

38:57.230 --> 38:58.051
It's a mystery.

38:58.071 --> 38:58.612
Mystery.

38:59.253 --> 38:59.673
Yeah.

39:00.174 --> 39:04.458
Well, FUWAMOFANS for joining us to the archive today!

39:04.739 --> 39:07.582
Here is your FUWAMOCO word for the comments!

39:08.362 --> 39:09.283
BAU BAU!

39:12.357 --> 39:12.717
What?

39:13.517 --> 39:14.997
Adventiversary!

39:15.438 --> 39:17.778
BAU BAU!

39:18.178 --> 39:18.498
BAU BAU!

39:18.518 --> 39:22.059
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

39:22.519 --> 39:26.339
Thank you for joining us for FUWAMOCO Morning today!

39:26.799 --> 39:33.641
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

39:34.041 --> 39:34.521
Copper Chef!

39:34.561 --> 39:34.981
Chef.
