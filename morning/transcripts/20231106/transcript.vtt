00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:11.891
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.995
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:20.299
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.122
BAU BAU!

00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:26.666
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:29.709
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.192
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:34.194 --> 00:05:39.941
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.282
BAU BAU!

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:45.707
Thank you Ruffians for being here with us today for our 40th episode!

00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:48.333
40.

00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:51.333
And really, it's not really 40 because there's other ones too.

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:52.234
Oh, sure.

00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:55.997
That is not... It's not wrong.

00:05:56.638 --> 00:05:57.138
It's right.

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:01.242
It's right because Mococo said it!

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:02.443
Sure, sure.

00:06:03.284 --> 00:06:07.848
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for the episode hype!

00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:09.409
Right?

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:10.000
40.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.331
BAU BAU.

00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:14.874
Well, just because it's the 40th episode doesn't mean that the...

00:06:15.194 --> 00:06:17.975
might not be new Ruffians with us today, right?

00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:26.138
So, to explain what FUWAMOCO Morning is, it's a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:27.539
AKA FUWAMOCO!

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:30.520
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.921
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face,

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.222
And help you start your day off on the right paw.

00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:42.844
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

00:06:43.284 --> 00:06:47.265
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:51.347
BAU BAU!

00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:52.747
The 40th episode.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:53.908
It's Monday.

00:06:54.388 --> 00:06:56.809
It's Monday, the 40th episode.

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:57.749
You know what that means.

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:04.424
It means that there's been a Pero Sighting!

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:04.644
Okay.

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.105
Where was Pero seen this time?

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:10.467
Let's see.

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:13.388
Bowling alley!

00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:14.328
You went bowling!

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:16.849
You're brave.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.010
Especially because it seems like you went bowling.

00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:23.185
Where's the Pero, too?

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.727
It kind of makes sense that Pero would be strong at bowling, right?

00:07:27.067 --> 00:07:30.189
I mean, after all, he's pretty round, too.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:31.630
I guess.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.310
I guess.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.512
You know, he's probably able to put himself easily in the perspective of a bowling ball.

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:38.593
Especially when he sits there with all of them.

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:42.075
It probably helps him with his secret technique, right?

00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:44.057
It's like method acting, right?

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:45.637
I don't know.

00:07:45.677 --> 00:07:46.638
Is that right?

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:48.496
Maybe!

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:49.777
Maybe!

00:07:49.877 --> 00:07:53.097
But, you know, you must be pretty awesome at bowling.

00:07:53.378 --> 00:07:55.478
Especially with that custom FUWAMOCO ball.

00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:56.058
Right!

00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:57.759
That was the first thing I saw.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.219
We hope you had lots of fun!

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.600
You know, hopefully you didn't hurt any of your fingers.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.280
You know, get those munched.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.620
Scary.

00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:10.129
BAU BAU!

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:13.950
We hope Pero didn't get too yappy or annoying, you know.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.871
Especially with that, he had a pretty nice score there.

00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:17.531
Right!

00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:19.172
BAU BAU!

00:08:19.252 --> 00:08:22.613
BAU BAU!

00:08:22.693 --> 00:08:24.133
That's pretty cool.

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:27.054
I wonder how you make a custom BAU BAU.

00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:28.095
Right!

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:28.435
Love.

00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:30.965
Lots of love.

00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:34.046
And on the topic of love.

00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:35.967
Love and peace.

00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:42.829
Since the other day it was the hololive Minecraft Sports Festival!

00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:49.438
Now, it was here, and now it's gone.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:55.739
But, I think we can all say that many good memories still stick with us.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.981
You know, it was a rather intense training period, you know.

00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:07.082
With some very, very early morning practices back to back in the Northwest Passage.

00:09:07.142 --> 00:09:14.184
But, somehow, we were able to survive and had an amazing time together with the Red Team.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.105
And, you know what?

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:18.072
Despite everything.

00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:19.638
In the end.

00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:21.164
Red Team won!

00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:25.563
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:27.904
Can you believe it, Ruffians?

00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:29.826
We did it!

00:09:30.286 --> 00:09:39.712
We're really really happy, but not because we won, but because we're able to get to know our team better and help them out and get to know our Senpai more.

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.573
We feel like we did our best.

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:43.855
So we're really happy!

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.356
In the end, it worked out.

00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:50.239
I feel like we couldn't have wished for a better First hololive Sports Day.

00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:52.597
Morning Ruffians!

00:09:53.117 --> 00:09:59.099
We're really thankful for Mikocchi-senpai, Subaru-senpai, and Mio-senpai.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:03.160
As well as all the staff who worked hard to organize and make it all possible.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.021
As well as you, Ruffians!

00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:09.061
You were there to cheer us on no matter what time of day.

00:10:11.062 --> 00:10:11.382
Thank you.

00:10:11.462 --> 00:10:12.003
Thank you!

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:13.644
We did it all together, okay?

00:10:14.044 --> 00:10:21.428
Also, if you haven't listened yet, go and listen to the opening theme song that Mio-senpai wrote and composed herself.

00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:22.348
So amazing.

00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:23.469
Check it out, okay?

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:27.091
BAU BAU!

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.013
Good memories.

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:31.033
Already.

00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:33.074
Only a couple days ago.

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:33.594
Right.

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:36.936
Yeah, check the opening out.

00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:37.557
Yeah!

00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:45.751
We actually have a bit of a confession.

00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:47.253
You know, in addition...

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:56.997
To all the good memories and everything, there's one secret that I think helped lead us to victory.

00:10:57.678 --> 00:11:01.221
And you know, Ruffians, even though both of us, we are both participating, right?

00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:04.803
Moco-chan was the only one playing, right?

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:11.789
And we're both beginners in Minecraft, so it's not like I could really give Moco-chan hints or help, even if I wanted to.

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:13.290
Well, you don't know what we're doing at all.

00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:13.611
No.

00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:21.016
Yeah, I don't know, even- But the- I was thinking though, even if I was good at Minecraft, could I really do much to help?

00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:23.177
I don't know.

00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:23.477
Maybe.

00:11:23.837 --> 00:11:24.858
Press this button!

00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:25.479
I don't know.

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.700
You would yell stuff anyways, no matter what.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.541
But!

00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:37.146
But, Ruffian, I actually did lend a helping hand in the most intense parts of the competition.

00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:39.348
And you know why?

00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:41.969
That's because!

00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:47.033
I became Moco-chan's hand rest!

00:11:47.354 --> 00:11:48.054
My arm rest.

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:48.534
Yeah.

00:11:48.654 --> 00:11:50.115
Hand rest, arm rest.

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:51.056
Yeah.

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:53.317
No.

00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:58.061
Because sometimes your hands and arms get tired when you're gaming, right?

00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:01.403
And just a simple chair arm rest isn't enough.

00:12:02.103 --> 00:12:02.463
No.

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:04.244
So you know what I do?

00:12:04.764 --> 00:12:13.109
I put my arm out to the desk so that Moco-chan could rest entirely of her arm on mine and then focus on what she was doing.

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:16.831
It was a true team effort by sisters.

00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.712
Yeah, you know, because I'm pretty far away from the keyboard.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:25.535
So it would get tiring for my arm to be outstretched for a really long time and pressing all the buttons.

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:27.936
So, it was just, it was done in secret.

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:31.258
Because maybe some Ruffians would have found it embarrassing.

00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:33.935
We kept it a secret for your sake.

00:12:34.055 --> 00:12:34.416
Yeah.

00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:35.436
But it worked out!

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:36.976
It worked out!

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.997
It was just arm on top of arm, okay?

00:12:39.057 --> 00:12:39.477
Yeah.

00:12:39.997 --> 00:12:40.677
Arm a mountain.

00:12:41.037 --> 00:12:44.458
Sometime I would be considerate and not put my full weight down.

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.239
But then, Fuwawa would be like, no.

00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:49.039
I gotta push Moco-chan's arm down.

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:50.180
Yeah.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.341
We did that during practice too.

00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:55.341
Secret strategy.

00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.062
I think it helped.

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:58.003
I think it helped.

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.665
BAU BAU!

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:11.373
And well, the topic of the hololive Sports Festival still continues because, you know, it was a really fun event.

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:16.838
At the end of a special event, there's something that you kind of want to do, right?

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:18.099
Right!

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.920
And that's take a photo!

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.581
Yeah!

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:29.612
You might have noticed a bit of a change when we uploaded this photo to Twitter, but... Did you see it?

00:13:29.732 --> 00:13:30.352
Did you see it?

00:13:30.372 --> 00:13:31.633
You were surprised, right?

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:32.594
Right?

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:38.619
Well, actually... I was there for a good reason.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.922
Moco-chan, do you have the photo in question?

00:13:44.984 --> 00:13:46.345
Yeah.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.670
There we are.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:50.331
Well, actually!

00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:55.974
This was all possible because Papa Puppy gave us a very old laptop.

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.095
Very old.

00:13:57.155 --> 00:13:58.916
Like more than 10 years old.

00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:04.359
And just so happens that Minecraft barely works on it!

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:06.680
So we're able to take a photo together!

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.481
It worked out well!

00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.642
We're so happy.

00:14:10.142 --> 00:14:15.045
We hope that maybe this will allow us to play on stream together in the future, but...

00:14:15.965 --> 00:14:18.648
Logistic wise, it's not quite there yet.

00:14:18.868 --> 00:14:23.132
You know, we have to find a way that's comfortable for both of us to play for long hours together.

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:28.497
You know, and there isn't enough room for even a laptop right now.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.528
So we're still trying to figure things out.

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:36.752
But we hope that you'll continue to wait for us, Ruffians.

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:37.593
We want to!

00:14:37.653 --> 00:14:38.433
You were shocked?

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.155
I'm sorry for shocking you.

00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:46.100
Borrowed a toaster from Papa Bobby.

00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:47.081
Exactly.

00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:50.584
The game screen was so small.

00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:53.607
So small, like smaller than a post-it note.

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:56.729
But we can probably figure out a way to change that.

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:57.529
Maybe.

00:14:57.929 --> 00:14:58.329
Maybe.

00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:00.329
BAU BAU!

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.890
I really hope we can play Minecraft soon.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.131
But at the very least, it was good that we got up a little together.

00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:08.071
Special time.

00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:10.172
BAU BAU!

00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:11.812
BAU BAU!

00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:13.173
Ruffians!

00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:18.174
Last FUWAMOCO Morning, there was something a little bit more extreme than normal.

00:15:18.674 --> 00:15:22.575
A bit of an extreme misunderstanding.

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:27.800
But, you know, it's a new week.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:33.302
And that means we're going to start on the right paw.

00:15:33.603 --> 00:15:38.304
And that's why... There's no misunderstanding!

00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:41.465
BAU BAU!

00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:42.426
We did it!

00:15:44.008 --> 00:15:46.489
Good, right, Moco-chan?

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:47.190
Right!

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.110
Yeah!

00:15:48.370 --> 00:16:03.977
Actually... I always get a little bit nervous when we have no misunderstandings because I feel like maybe we're just forgetting and there actually are other misunderstandings that we're forgetting about and kind of need to clear up, but... I don't know.

00:16:04.237 --> 00:16:05.798
Oh well!

00:16:05.838 --> 00:16:08.059
There's nothing, right, Ruffians?

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.460
Right?

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.181
I'm just being silly, right?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.221
Oh my!

00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:19.105
Oh my!

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:25.953
Wow. It's good that there's no misunderstanding. It's good, yeah. Ruffians!

00:16:26.634 --> 00:16:39.610
You might have noticed that on our schedule for this week... It's a little bit different than previous ones. And it's not just because we're not streaming on Sunday for the first time ever, no. No, no.

00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:45.645
And very funny.

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:51.187
That's because... All the hours are a bit different.

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:54.548
They're an hour different than usual!

00:16:56.409 --> 00:16:59.250
The time thief got us Ruffians.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.432
But not because we want it to be like this.

00:17:04.872 --> 00:17:10.454
It's all because of the awful, the dreaded Daylight Savings.

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:16.587
Daylight savings time has come to an end, Ruffians.

00:17:17.227 --> 00:17:20.668
So now, everything is funny.

00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:22.249
We're so sorry.

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:23.989
We're sorry, Ruffians!

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.690
We know this is super troubleshooting.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.730
We don't like it either.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.211
Nobody likes it.

00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:31.771
We have no control over it.

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:35.412
But it's a rule we must follow nonetheless.

00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:41.269
We hope, Ruffians, that this doesn't mean that we won't see you for a while, right?

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:47.595
But we understand if it does make it more difficult for you to be here live with us too, okay?

00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:52.720
We hope it won't be BAU BAU for too long, right?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.421
We'll be waiting for you, okay?

00:17:56.496 --> 00:17:57.796
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:59.137
Thank you for understanding.

00:17:59.177 --> 00:18:00.337
It will be difficult.

00:18:00.877 --> 00:18:02.638
It'll be back soon enough, okay?

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:03.858
Soon enough, you know?

00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:07.920
And thank you for being here with us regardless, today, too.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.080
BAU BAU!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.480
BAU BAU!

00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:11.661
Silly time.

00:18:12.521 --> 00:18:14.822
I don't know why it has to be like this.

00:18:18.268 --> 00:18:18.969
Don't like it.

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:22.612
It's the ruffest day, ruffest time of the year.

00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:24.894
Just six months, right?

00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:26.516
Just half a year, right?

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:30.200
Well, it's already been three months, so we should go by it fast enough, right?

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:30.960
Right!

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:31.941
It'll be okay.

00:18:34.181 --> 00:18:37.262
But, onto happier things!

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:45.206
Ruffians, as you might know, because we kind of talked about it last FUWAMOCO Morning, Mahajama-senpai!

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:49.988
Mahajama-senpai has made her return back to streaming!

00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:56.731
And today, she held a call-in stream for hololive members!

00:18:57.031 --> 00:18:58.212
So you know what we did?

00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:07.555
We gathered up our courage and we phoned in to chat with her for the very first time today forever!

00:19:07.575 --> 00:19:07.995
Forever.

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:08.835
The first time ever.

00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:12.857
BAU BAU!

00:19:12.937 --> 00:19:17.039
We're so happy that we're finally able to talk with her!

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:19.800
We really admire her so we're so happy she's back.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.321
FUWAMOCO-chan, you drew this special picture too!

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:23.822
Yeah!

00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:25.122
I did!

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.163
You know what?

00:19:26.183 --> 00:19:36.847
When we were able to chat with Hatsumo-senpai, we let her know that she's the person that introduced us to hololive when I kind of mistook her as a visual novel heroine.

00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:42.510
We also talked about playing Minecraft together, or cooking maybe one day!

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.094
I think that'd be a lot of fun, but... How about we cook something, maybe?

00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:48.716
No spiders, please.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:49.577
Yeah.

00:19:49.677 --> 00:19:53.821
We were just happy to manage to quickly chat with her before she ended her streaming night.

00:19:54.202 --> 00:19:57.665
We were just in time, but we were really nervous.

00:19:57.746 --> 00:19:58.907
And still super sleepy.

00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:02.471
Because we had seriously just woken up five minutes before.

00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:03.352
Seriously, yeah.

00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:08.014
It was like, roll out of bed, go to computer.

00:20:08.034 --> 00:20:11.977
Yeah, you know, my hair was still fluffy and fluffy.

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:15.298
But now it's like how it's supposed to be.

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:18.140
Thank you Hato-senpai!

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.000
Fukkatsu!

00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:19.861
Omedetou!

00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:20.381
BAU BAU!

00:20:20.421 --> 00:20:22.342
Yeah, no spoilers.

00:20:29.546 --> 00:20:31.530
Ingredients that are lost.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.291
Mushrooms.

00:20:33.153 --> 00:20:34.475
Oh, that's kind of plain though, no?

00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:37.039
I was thinking like, Hatsuma-senpai's hair.

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:39.897
That would be okay, right?

00:20:39.917 --> 00:20:41.618
Mushrooms, mushrooms.

00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:44.079
BAU BAU!

00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:46.561
More happy news!

00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:50.283
Ruffians, we are really happy to find out yesterday.

00:20:50.303 --> 00:20:59.249
Super happy to find out that our original introduction song, Lifetime Showtime, was introduced on VR!

00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:05.332
On Suisei Senpai's radio show that she hosts on NHK FM.

00:21:05.712 --> 00:21:07.854
It's a radio show about VTuber music.

00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:17.107
Thank you so much!

00:21:17.287 --> 00:21:19.567
This is FUWAMOCO's video debut.

00:21:19.707 --> 00:21:21.628
Does it count?

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:22.608
Does it count?

00:21:22.928 --> 00:21:23.788
I think it counts!

00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:27.629
BAU BAU!

00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:35.751
The reason why is because this time on this episode of VR, Suho Patrasam is a guest star.

00:21:36.778 --> 00:21:39.065
Ruffians, you remember Pato-san, right?

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:46.963
Yeah, Patra is an amazingly talented and cute VTuber who wrote the song for us!

00:21:47.363 --> 00:21:51.266
So we're so happy that she wanted to share it with everyone too!

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:52.907
Super talented.

00:21:52.987 --> 00:21:55.369
Thank you so much, Patra-san!

00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:56.049
Thank you!

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.390
Arigatou!

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.892
We're really happy that we were able to reach so many more people's ears.

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:08.157
If you'd like to catch the radio show, you can listen to the archive on the official webpage for the next week!

00:22:08.237 --> 00:22:08.438
But...

00:22:09.318 --> 00:22:14.281
We have a feeling that it might be difficult to listen to it if you're located outside of Japan.

00:22:14.361 --> 00:22:19.764
Yeah, at the very least, we couldn't listen to it in the Northwest Passage, so... It might be tricky.

00:22:20.284 --> 00:22:22.766
Let us know if you're able to have a listen to it, okay, Ruffians?

00:22:22.826 --> 00:22:22.986
Okay!

00:22:26.828 --> 00:22:26.908
Okay!

00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:31.181
BAU BAU!

00:22:31.703 --> 00:22:37.660
Well... Ruffians, it's the start of a new week. And a new week means a new challenge, right? Right?

00:22:40.982 --> 00:22:42.903
Right!

00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:45.564
And, you know, Moco-chan.

00:22:45.964 --> 00:22:55.308
Last week, maybe we was a bit of a challenge in a different way, but this week, we're back to NATTO!

00:22:55.928 --> 00:22:57.409
Moco-chan, yeah.

00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.690
You can't escape this time.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.250
Finally.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.871
Moco-chan will be eating natto once more today!

00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:04.572
I hurt.

00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:07.993
My head hurts, and my neck hurts, and my face hurts.

00:23:08.093 --> 00:23:09.233
No, natto's good for me.

00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:09.794
My eyes hurt.

00:23:09.814 --> 00:23:10.634
There's no heart.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.482
Ruffians, this will be Moco-chan's 8th time trying to eat a FUWAMOCO Morning.

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.503
And you know, there was some progress last time.

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:21.063
Yeah, Moco-chan.

00:23:21.103 --> 00:23:21.884
Good progress.

00:23:22.024 --> 00:23:23.664
You ate and swallowed one bean.

00:23:23.844 --> 00:23:24.644
Yeah, it was good.

00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:25.165
Yeah.

00:23:25.765 --> 00:23:31.827
But for some Ruffians that might not be too familiar with natto, natto is a common breakfast food in Japan.

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:34.068
And it's made of fermented soybeans.

00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:38.409
It can be pretty sticky, pretty slimy, kinda...

00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:43.214
Strong smelling, but it's really healthy for you too.

00:23:44.375 --> 00:23:47.797
And that's why Moco-chan's gonna get over her fear.

00:23:48.017 --> 00:23:48.717
I want to.

00:23:48.797 --> 00:23:50.118
Her dislike for it.

00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:51.479
And you know what?

00:23:51.739 --> 00:23:53.440
She can eat it, become healthy.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.903
Continue to protect your smile for many many years to come.

00:23:57.263 --> 00:23:59.684
Just like me, Fuwawa.

00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:03.327
Are you ready Moco-chan?

00:24:03.347 --> 00:24:04.628
Not really, no.

00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:06.429
Well, Ruffians, guess what?

00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:12.420
This time, I found something that I thought might help Moco-chan.

00:24:12.961 --> 00:24:20.649
I have something here a little bit different this time.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.551
It's dried natto!

00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:23.713
Can you hear it?

00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:27.690
There's a bunch of little natto.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.291
It's a dry natto.

00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.373
It's not really a breakfast food.

00:24:31.653 --> 00:24:34.696
It's actually a snack that tastes just like natto.

00:24:34.736 --> 00:24:37.699
It has a natto taste, but that's because it's natto.

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:41.002
It's just dry, so it's not really slimy.

00:24:41.422 --> 00:24:42.744
It's not really sticky.

00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:45.206
It's just natto.

00:24:45.446 --> 00:24:46.127
Isn't it waste?

00:24:46.207 --> 00:24:47.628
No, it's a snack.

00:24:47.788 --> 00:24:49.029
Dry natto, yeah!

00:24:50.851 --> 00:24:52.615
So I have a bunch of them here.

00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:57.704
And, you know, this way should help Moco-chan, should help you get used to the taste a bit more, I think.

00:24:58.854 --> 00:25:00.154
Smells really yummy.

00:25:00.414 --> 00:25:03.355
You're not careful, I'm gonna eat them all.

00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:04.836
But today, Moco-chan.

00:25:05.156 --> 00:25:06.916
You know, last time you ate one bean.

00:25:07.056 --> 00:25:08.456
One actual natto bean.

00:25:08.496 --> 00:25:09.997
Yeah, so I'll eat one bean again.

00:25:10.037 --> 00:25:10.257
No.

00:25:10.637 --> 00:25:14.198
This time, I'd like you to eat a whole handful of these, okay?

00:25:14.498 --> 00:25:15.998
There's no zipper on the bag.

00:25:16.038 --> 00:25:17.299
No, that's not possible, okay?

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:18.619
Moco-chan, there's no zipper on the bag.

00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:19.279
I can try a bit.

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:19.919
I can try a bit.

00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:20.660
This is white serving.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.180
I'm saying I will try a bit.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.220
Eat half the bag, okay?

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.540
No.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.041
Give me that.

00:25:24.061 --> 00:25:24.201
No.

00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:25.261
Okay, well...

00:25:26.081 --> 00:25:26.522
Moco-chan.

00:25:26.723 --> 00:25:29.190
I guarantee you the full bag is not one serving.

00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.175
Let me see the servings on that.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:32.590
It is.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.350
No.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.590
It is.

00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.271
No, it's not.

00:25:34.291 --> 00:25:35.871
The package is 14 grams.

00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:38.412
And the serving size is 14 grams.

00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:39.492
One serving.

00:25:40.013 --> 00:25:41.533
I'm just asking you to eat half.

00:25:41.913 --> 00:25:42.574
Let's half it.

00:25:42.714 --> 00:25:42.974
No.

00:25:42.994 --> 00:25:43.574
Half serving.

00:25:43.714 --> 00:25:43.894
No.

00:25:44.014 --> 00:25:44.494
7 grams.

00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:46.355
But, but, but, but!

00:25:46.715 --> 00:25:47.115
First!

00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:50.076
This time we're not saying thank you to the farmers in Tochigi.

00:25:50.396 --> 00:25:53.737
We're saying thank you to the farmers in AMERICA!

00:25:54.037 --> 00:25:56.818
Who grew the beans and worked hard to make them.

00:25:56.958 --> 00:25:57.119
Okay!

00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:00.726
I'm not gonna have them all.

00:26:01.106 --> 00:26:02.126
No, you're gonna eat half.

00:26:02.587 --> 00:26:04.627
Looking at them... Smell it, Moco-chan.

00:26:04.948 --> 00:26:05.988
It's a little bit different.

00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:07.909
Looking at them, they look like chips.

00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:09.229
They look like chips.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.990
They're still natto.

00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:14.872
Okay, I have two of them.

00:26:14.912 --> 00:26:15.252
There's like...

00:26:16.089 --> 00:26:17.030
Moco-chan, smell!

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.750
Smell all of them first.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:18.190
No, I don't want to.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.151
I don't want to.

00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:20.171
It smells really good.

00:26:20.251 --> 00:26:22.273
It looks like it has, like, chip dust on it.

00:26:22.353 --> 00:26:23.954
It smells kind of like... I don't know.

00:26:23.974 --> 00:26:26.275
It smells like fall a bit to me.

00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:29.637
It doesn't smell like anything.

00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:30.597
It smells like chips.

00:26:30.998 --> 00:26:31.798
It smells like chips.

00:26:32.038 --> 00:26:32.779
It's chip dust.

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:34.920
Okay, I'm gonna try two then.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.620
Let's try.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.481
Yeah.

00:26:38.202 --> 00:26:39.302
I'm kind of envious.

00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:41.083
Choo choo choo!

00:26:41.544 --> 00:26:42.324
Choo choo choo!

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:43.765
Huh?

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:50.839
I thought Moco-chan would be like, oh they're just chips.

00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:51.199
No!

00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:51.800
No!

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.080
Water!

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:53.661
No!

00:26:53.681 --> 00:26:54.341
Water!

00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:55.782
Water!

00:26:56.082 --> 00:26:57.503
Really really water!

00:26:57.563 --> 00:26:58.603
Really really water!

00:26:58.623 --> 00:26:58.663
No!

00:26:59.263 --> 00:27:00.684
Really really water!

00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:01.084
Please!

00:27:01.164 --> 00:27:01.585
Please!

00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:04.506
You should eat two more.

00:27:05.187 --> 00:27:06.247
Please!

00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:06.867
Please!

00:27:07.428 --> 00:27:08.208
No!

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:13.311
Moco-chan, that's rude to the American farmers who made them.

00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:23.087
What a chest dry natto.

00:27:23.107 --> 00:27:24.667
It's not like they stick your slime in.

00:27:24.727 --> 00:27:26.128
Even that's strong smelling.

00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:28.368
I'm gonna have a bunch then.

00:27:29.388 --> 00:27:32.029
At first, I thought... I have six here.

00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:33.089
Let me speak.

00:27:33.589 --> 00:27:36.230
At first, I thought, this is okay.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.951
It just tastes like some sort of weird chips.

00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:40.431
And then it hit me.

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.681
It hit me hard.

00:27:45.682 --> 00:27:48.545
I think it's a very mild taste in comparison.

00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:50.807
My body feels so hot.

00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:53.189
It has an American flavor to it.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.651
An America taste.

00:27:56.492 --> 00:27:58.795
Not the usual Tochigi taste, maybe?

00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:02.728
It has a strong umami to it.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.571
Yeah, Moco-chan.

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.672
I'm exhausted.

00:28:07.692 --> 00:28:09.834
I'm done for the day.

00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:11.315
Was that rough?

00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:12.316
It wasn't slimy.

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:14.037
There was no strings involved.

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:16.219
It's like it's concentrated.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:21.258
I don't think so.

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:26.441
This is the American taste.

00:28:28.202 --> 00:28:30.263
Well Moco-chan, how do you think it went this time?

00:28:30.283 --> 00:28:32.564
Did it help you kind of conquer it a bit more?

00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:35.726
Was it preferable to just go back to the normal Mato?

00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:37.687
No, at first I had confidence.

00:28:38.847 --> 00:28:41.849
And I thought it would be okay, and then it really hit me.

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:49.396
I do feel like this taste isn't as like... I like the tochigi taste.

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:53.799
This tastes a bit more... Mummified?

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.180
Mummified!

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.422
It tastes more like natto mummies.

00:28:58.282 --> 00:28:58.682
Yeah.

00:28:58.702 --> 00:29:00.363
I don't know.

00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:01.164
Not artificial.

00:29:01.184 --> 00:29:01.985
Just like mummies.

00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:02.825
Just like mummies.

00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:03.646
Natto mummies.

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:16.944
More successful.

00:29:17.124 --> 00:29:18.385
You did your best today, Moco-chan.

00:29:18.405 --> 00:29:19.045
I ate two of them.

00:29:19.065 --> 00:29:22.065
Dry natto should be perfectly fine.

00:29:22.085 --> 00:29:24.586
I ate six!

00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:26.446
And I didn't have any water.

00:29:26.726 --> 00:29:28.286
It's good.

00:29:31.447 --> 00:29:32.987
That was an attempt.

00:29:33.707 --> 00:29:34.667
Good job, Moco-chan.

00:29:35.467 --> 00:29:35.728
I guess.

00:29:36.268 --> 00:29:36.928
I did my best.

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:39.548
BAU BAU!

00:29:39.588 --> 00:29:40.528
BAU BAU!

00:29:40.708 --> 00:29:43.509
Well, let's take a look at some of our regular corners, Moco-chan!

00:29:44.818 --> 00:29:47.980
Doggie of the Day!

00:29:48.361 --> 00:29:48.961
Much better.

00:29:49.842 --> 00:29:50.382
Much better.

00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:54.485
Now here's our Doggie of the Day!

00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:55.246
De-den!

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:59.289
It's Kira!

00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:00.530
Kira!

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.270
So cute!

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.392
But Kira looks a little bit upset here.

00:30:05.293 --> 00:30:07.435
Yeah, I feel like this all the time too.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.050
You know it.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.754
Why do they get to go outside for such a beautiful walk when I'm stuck in here, right?

00:30:14.094 --> 00:30:14.634
Yeah.

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:16.115
I feel like that a lot recently.

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:17.997
Staring out the window, look at the beautiful... Right!

00:30:18.157 --> 00:30:19.438
It looks nice!

00:30:19.598 --> 00:30:21.419
I wanna go out too!

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:22.880
But... I can't.

00:30:23.461 --> 00:30:23.941
Yeah.

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:25.162
It's rough.

00:30:25.942 --> 00:30:32.907
Yeah, but you know we're sure that your Ruffian opened that door up and took you on a nice walk moments or after, after the photo, right?

00:30:32.947 --> 00:30:33.188
Right.

00:30:33.528 --> 00:30:33.848
Right.

00:30:34.248 --> 00:30:34.669
Right!

00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:35.649
I'm sure.

00:30:39.163 --> 00:30:40.786
How does Kira BAU BAU?

00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:45.192
Kira Kira BAU BAU!

00:30:45.212 --> 00:30:46.894
Kira Kira BAU BAU!

00:30:46.934 --> 00:30:47.635
Like that!

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:57.724
I just want to say, I very much like how fluffy Kira is.

00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:02.069
And the kind of caramelization we have going on.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.451
Very cute.

00:31:03.771 --> 00:31:08.538
Kira loves, loves, loves, loves waffles.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:11.020
You better take her for a walk.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.481
You better.

00:31:12.181 --> 00:31:15.264
Don't even think of going out without taking her along, okay?

00:31:15.304 --> 00:31:16.164
Don't think of it!

00:31:16.244 --> 00:31:16.605
Yeah.

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.766
She wants to be with you everywhere you go.

00:31:18.786 --> 00:31:19.947
She wants to be with you!

00:31:19.967 --> 00:31:20.147
Yeah.

00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:22.509
And that's because she loves you!

00:31:26.612 --> 00:31:28.073
What was that just now, Moco-chan?

00:31:28.354 --> 00:31:29.374
I don't know.

00:31:30.475 --> 00:31:32.737
BAU BAU!

00:31:33.997 --> 00:31:36.299
And for today, I went on a walk.

00:31:36.739 --> 00:31:40.422
Ruffians are still going on walks despite the cold weather.

00:31:40.442 --> 00:31:42.123
We have De-den!

00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:46.846
It's a sunrise or sunset.

00:31:47.407 --> 00:31:49.128
Such a pretty flower.

00:31:50.014 --> 00:31:51.855
I think it's the end of the day.

00:31:52.195 --> 00:31:57.859
And kind of looks like the end or maybe the start of civilization too.

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:03.210
This really looks like the perfect walk to listen to Mumei-senpai's new song, Mumei Tulen.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.370
Right!

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:05.791
Such a good choice.

00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:06.591
We like doing that.

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:13.072
Yeah, we hope that the beautiful scenery coupled with the emotions of Mumei-senpai's song didn't make you too teary or anything.

00:32:13.112 --> 00:32:13.592
Right!

00:32:13.772 --> 00:32:14.632
Not too teary.

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:19.514
We get like that sometimes when we listen to good songs on a walk too, right?

00:32:19.554 --> 00:32:19.734
Yeah.

00:32:19.774 --> 00:32:21.114
You just can't help it sometimes.

00:32:21.134 --> 00:32:21.954
You can't help it!

00:32:22.454 --> 00:32:25.855
It just makes you so happy to be alive and out and just...

00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:30.430
BAU BAU!

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:35.153
Do we receive any questions from Ruffians this time, Moco-chan?

00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:36.394
Let's see.

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:46.220
Our Question of the Day is... Do you have any rituals or habits that you do just before the stream starts or just after it ends?

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.701
This is a good question.

00:32:47.761 --> 00:32:50.603
I think Ruffians, you want to know the answer to this question.

00:32:51.823 --> 00:32:52.723
We do it!

00:32:52.903 --> 00:32:54.484
We have a lot of rituals, I don't know.

00:32:54.784 --> 00:32:57.545
I think more than the usual hololive member maybe?

00:32:57.985 --> 00:33:03.366
But we wake up at least 3 hours before the stream so that our voices can kind of wake up.

00:33:03.386 --> 00:33:05.006
You know, the barkers can get barking.

00:33:06.047 --> 00:33:11.028
Sometimes it's been a bit closer to 2 hours recently, which is not good.

00:33:12.392 --> 00:33:14.133
But we can't help it that much.

00:33:14.553 --> 00:33:19.554
But we also like to make sure that we eat at least a little something beforehand.

00:33:20.195 --> 00:33:22.995
And most importantly, do vocal warm-ups as well.

00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:25.156
Brush teeth, wash face, that stuff.

00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:27.937
Well, those just go, you know, you wake up and that's what you do.

00:33:27.997 --> 00:33:32.839
Well, yeah, but, you know, wash face before stream too.

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:36.520
You know, and afterwards, we try to make sure to do stretches.

00:33:37.543 --> 00:33:39.684
What do you think, Ruffians?

00:33:55.723 --> 00:33:58.085
I think there's always new stuff we could add to our routine.

00:33:58.105 --> 00:33:59.385
Do you have any suggestions?

00:33:59.425 --> 00:34:03.328
But generally, by this time we know what, like, this minute we should be doing this.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:04.128
This should be done.

00:34:04.148 --> 00:34:05.149
Yeah.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.310
Yeah.

00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:09.252
Preparation work is hard, right?

00:34:09.272 --> 00:34:11.853
We have to make sure everything's prepared, you know?

00:34:12.054 --> 00:34:15.316
By the minute, so it's like, every five minutes we know what should be done.

00:34:15.336 --> 00:34:15.776
Yeah.

00:34:16.585 --> 00:34:17.566
Is everything scheduled?

00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:18.506
More or less.

00:34:19.207 --> 00:34:24.130
Schedule doesn't like... FUWAMOCO, we have a schedule, like a routine schedule that we follow.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.292
It's not like an automated thing.

00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:26.612
No.

00:34:27.293 --> 00:34:27.973
It's just us.

00:34:29.514 --> 00:34:30.315
Do a flip!

00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:32.576
Oh, that would be good after stretching.

00:34:32.656 --> 00:34:33.577
A morning hug.

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:38.380
Not quite, but before going to sleep, we go, let's have a good day tomorrow.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.861
Let's make it a good day, okay?

00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.103
A morning hug.

00:34:43.244 --> 00:34:48.968
How about a morning high five, Ruffians?

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:57.453
Maybe not a morning hug, but... I don't know, a hug in the morning, isn't that... Wow.

00:34:57.894 --> 00:34:58.634
In the morning.

00:34:59.575 --> 00:35:00.295
In the morning.

00:35:01.056 --> 00:35:03.278
I don't know, that's too much for the morning, no.

00:35:03.298 --> 00:35:05.019
Too sleepy.

00:35:07.425 --> 00:35:08.166
Morning High Five.

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:10.908
BAU BAU!

00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:17.753
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

00:35:18.293 --> 00:35:24.378
I want you to remember to never forget that FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make together.

00:35:24.418 --> 00:35:27.280
FUWAMOCO and you, Ruffians.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.123
So we always are looking forward to more Doggy of the Days with questions.

00:35:32.223 --> 00:35:32.784
Questions!

00:35:32.804 --> 00:35:35.246
I feel like, Ruffians, you have a lot of questions, but yeah.

00:35:35.786 --> 00:35:37.067
I don't see that many questions.

00:35:37.207 --> 00:35:37.487
Hi.

00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:40.868
And you know Pero Sightings, it works too.

00:35:40.988 --> 00:35:46.111
And you know if you post your question or your Doggie of the Day or your Pero Sightings,

00:35:47.635 --> 00:35:51.318
Please don't delete them.

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:54.140
I understand, I understand.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:01.666
But there's been a couple Ruffians that were chosen for it and then suddenly it's deleted.

00:36:01.686 --> 00:36:04.868
I understand, I understand.

00:36:04.948 --> 00:36:06.770
Sometimes maybe you get a little bit shy.

00:36:09.832 --> 00:36:11.613
It's happened a couple times.

00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:14.834
We would like to include you because you're important too.

00:36:14.954 --> 00:36:17.135
Please don't be embarrassed.

00:36:17.155 --> 00:36:18.615
Thank you Ruffians!

00:36:19.176 --> 00:36:21.156
BAU BAU!

00:36:21.436 --> 00:36:23.877
Moco-chan!

00:36:23.937 --> 00:36:25.778
What's our next stream coming up?

00:36:25.798 --> 00:36:27.819
Our next stream we have...

00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:32.885
The Kidnap!

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:35.326
It's the new Chilla's Art Game.

00:36:35.346 --> 00:36:39.287
We're not really too sure what to expect.

00:36:40.207 --> 00:36:42.068
I hope it's not scary.

00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:48.050
You know, we've had more than enough training after all the spooky games we played through October, right?

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.711
We'll see how it goes and try not to get dogged up.

00:36:52.552 --> 00:36:54.494
We're not gonna be doing the dog napping, right?

00:36:54.774 --> 00:36:56.055
No, I don't think so.

00:36:56.515 --> 00:36:58.396
I have no clue what to expect with this game.

00:36:58.837 --> 00:37:00.318
Convenience store was different too.

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:02.739
I don't know.

00:37:02.979 --> 00:37:04.400
Both could be interesting.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.520
BAU BAU!

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.901
Let's take another peek at our schedule.

00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:11.802
Tomorrow is a very special day, Ruffians.

00:37:12.102 --> 00:37:16.403
It marks 100 days from our debut and also 100 days consistently streaming.

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:25.326
Every single day!

00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:26.887
Every single day!

00:37:26.907 --> 00:37:29.808
A lot of times, even multiple times a day too!

00:37:29.828 --> 00:37:36.931
We hope that these 100 days have been special and fulfilling for you, just as they have been for us.

00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:40.933
We hope that you'll be there with us to celebrate OK Ruffians!

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:43.214
BAU BAU!

00:37:43.255 --> 00:37:44.736

00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:46.457
Every single day!

00:37:46.538 --> 00:37:48.659
Not a day missed.

00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:51.602
Thank you, Ruffians.

00:37:51.682 --> 00:37:54.044
BAU BAU!

00:37:54.064 --> 00:37:59.810
That was today's 40th episode of FUWAMOCO.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.412
FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:06.727 --> 00:38:13.350
But we really want to say a big thank you for you for being here with us for the past 100 days.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.051
And we are looking forward to many many more from here on out.

00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:19.932
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:23.233
Thank you for joining us for today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:30.355
Before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians today!

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:30.435

00:38:32.907 --> 00:38:33.288

This was today's FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:39:35.759 --> 00:39:36.079
Really?

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:40.849
This was FUWAMOCO Morning!
