05:10.050 --> 05:12.414
Hallo hallo BAU BAU!

05:12.894 --> 05:16.278
It's time for FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:16.298 --> 05:18.581
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

05:18.621 --> 05:19.042
BAU BAU!

05:22.702 --> 05:25.644
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

05:26.104 --> 05:28.326
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

05:28.506 --> 05:30.488
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

05:30.548 --> 05:33.210
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

05:33.690 --> 05:38.594
And today we're your hosts of FUWAMOCO Morning!

05:39.174 --> 05:44.318
Thank you Ruffians for joining us today for our 65th episode!

05:44.999 --> 05:46.400
Already 65 episodes, right?

05:48.121 --> 05:50.424
As the second week of January.

05:51.085 --> 05:51.746
BAU BAU!

05:51.766 --> 05:55.330
Good morning, Ruffians!

05:55.450 --> 05:57.012
BAU BAU!

05:58.908 --> 06:05.351
You know, the new year, new outfits, maybe there's some new Ruffians watching us today.

06:05.591 --> 06:07.811
Maybe you haven't noticed though.

06:07.851 --> 06:08.272
Who knows?

06:09.052 --> 06:11.513
Well, take note of FUWAMOCO Morning.

06:11.753 --> 06:17.515
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

06:17.535 --> 06:18.415
A.K.A.

06:18.455 --> 06:19.355
FUWAMOCO!

06:19.796 --> 06:23.157
And it's hosted by us, FUWAMOCO!

06:23.898 --> 06:29.135
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face and help you start your day off on the right paw.

06:33.514 --> 06:35.375
I wasn't too busy winking, no!

06:35.415 --> 06:40.818
Please tweet your thoughts with the hashtag #FWMCMORNING!

06:41.058 --> 06:44.980
Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

06:45.380 --> 06:48.101
BAU BAU!

06:48.642 --> 06:51.863
BAU BAU, good morning, Ruffians!

06:52.604 --> 06:55.765
Yeah, FUWAMOCO Morning a little bit different this morning, huh?

06:55.805 --> 06:56.806
Can you look a bit different?

06:58.188 --> 06:59.049
I wonder why.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.970
Moco-chan, is that why you're winking?

07:00.991 --> 07:02.852
To appeal to the Ruffians?

07:05.094 --> 07:09.418
BAU BAU!

07:09.438 --> 07:11.220
Moco-chan.

07:13.902 --> 07:20.728
Yet again, there's been another Pero Sighting.

07:22.795 --> 07:23.035
Really?

07:23.055 --> 07:23.155
What?

07:23.515 --> 07:28.017
I mean, considering, you know, you didn't see him for a new outfit.

07:28.457 --> 07:38.080
Yeah, but, you know, if Pero was, you know, working at the shrine, then maybe, you know, he would still be working at the shrine for a little bit longer or something.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.361
He's just everywhere, huh?

07:40.941 --> 07:44.862
Well, this time, a Ruffian spotted him here.

07:47.267 --> 07:53.070
Oh... That... Suika game has changed a little bit for you there, huh?

07:53.951 --> 07:55.432
Why is Pero there?

07:55.852 --> 07:58.554
You know, he's not a part of the evolution chart, right?

07:58.774 --> 08:00.455
Food evolution chart!

08:00.715 --> 08:00.995
Fruit.

08:01.596 --> 08:02.156
No, fruit!

08:02.176 --> 08:02.737
Fruit!

08:03.557 --> 08:05.859
Pero's neither fruit nor food.

08:06.759 --> 08:07.920
He's a beast, okay?

08:07.980 --> 08:11.622
Yeah, you definitely wouldn't find him anywhere that says groceries.

08:11.882 --> 08:12.263
No.

08:12.383 --> 08:15.505
Yeah, but... I don't know... He kinda look at it.

08:16.681 --> 08:18.362
Are you blurring your eyes a little bit?

08:19.022 --> 08:22.164
He does kind of look like he fits in there right.

08:22.904 --> 08:24.025
Do you see him, Moco-chan?

08:24.745 --> 08:25.525
Maybe!

08:25.625 --> 08:26.146
Slay him!

08:26.186 --> 08:26.726
Ruffians!

08:28.207 --> 08:29.707
I think he kind of fits there though.

08:29.768 --> 08:30.088
No?

08:31.488 --> 08:32.349
He fits in.

08:32.889 --> 08:33.609
Interesting.

08:34.310 --> 08:36.391
Are you blurring your eyes on Ruffians?

08:36.591 --> 08:38.252
You have to really go like this.

08:38.352 --> 08:38.732
Okay.

08:39.352 --> 08:39.853
Yeah.

08:41.773 --> 08:42.274
I can see it.

08:42.654 --> 08:43.454
I can see it.

08:44.115 --> 08:44.635
Yeah.

08:44.977 --> 08:51.745
Well, you know, it's a good thing that we haven't updated our game recently, because if this is a new update...

08:54.056 --> 08:59.541
You know, our game, as you saw before just now, it's still Pero-less.

09:00.021 --> 09:01.683
Although there is the weird cloud high.

09:01.963 --> 09:03.344
The cloud high!

09:04.205 --> 09:08.448
No Pero, but the weird cloud that's apparently always been there.

09:08.869 --> 09:09.329
Yeah!

09:09.729 --> 09:11.671
But we just noticed.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.953
But I guess you know...

09:16.206 --> 09:19.529
Probably have just a little different game maybe.

09:20.090 --> 09:23.312
Yeah, and we kind of took a peek at your score there.

09:23.332 --> 09:28.397
And I don't know, I don't think we did much better than you did.

09:29.398 --> 09:29.918
BAU BAU!

09:29.938 --> 09:31.920
BAU BAU!

09:31.940 --> 09:32.501
BAU BAU!

09:34.342 --> 09:38.726
Yeah, you don't... I guess the game maybe... Your score is nothing to sneeze at though.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.630
It's kind of our score too, right?

09:44.014 --> 09:49.358
But, you know, I guess maybe the game... The game must just be harder because you have the Pero version, right?

09:49.398 --> 09:51.820
So... Yeah, I guess you know.

09:52.300 --> 09:57.804
FUWAMOCO... We'll try a bit harder Suica game!

09:57.964 --> 10:00.266
But I bet you we have more fun than you, huh?

10:00.286 --> 10:02.187
That's a threat!

10:02.247 --> 10:02.988
Good luck!

10:03.108 --> 10:05.910
Good luck with Suica game and the Pero version!

10:06.050 --> 10:06.931
Good luck, you'll need it.

10:07.491 --> 10:07.811
BAU BAU!

10:11.279 --> 10:16.143
Well, Ruffians, you know, it's been a busy weekend.

10:16.163 --> 10:19.786
A weekend full of very exciting events.

10:19.806 --> 10:21.167
A lot of stuff!

10:21.587 --> 10:25.951
And a big part of that just happened a few hours ago.

10:25.971 --> 10:27.032
Did you know this?

10:27.152 --> 10:27.932
Ruffians!

10:28.613 --> 10:31.515
RuffianS!

10:31.876 --> 10:35.238
RuffianS!

10:35.378 --> 10:36.780
I got a bit too excited.

10:37.080 --> 10:37.720
Do it again!

10:40.229 --> 10:40.990
Do it again!

10:41.610 --> 10:42.190
Ruffians!

10:44.371 --> 10:44.772
Ruffians!

10:44.792 --> 10:47.413
You can't do it!

10:47.893 --> 10:50.054
Ruffians!

10:51.075 --> 10:51.775
Ruffians!

10:52.576 --> 10:54.237
It's not the same note!

10:58.394 --> 11:00.375
When do you have to say hi?

11:00.395 --> 11:01.076
Good morning.

11:01.136 --> 11:02.297
When do you have to say it?

11:02.317 --> 11:02.817
We did it, Ruffians!

11:02.837 --> 11:03.818
All together!

11:04.218 --> 11:05.499
We hit 700,000 Ruffians!

11:06.139 --> 11:25.551
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

11:26.078 --> 11:34.004
How thankful we are to have you here laughing with us, sometimes maybe crying with us, and supporting us on this journey.

11:34.504 --> 11:35.745
Thank you, Ruffians.

11:36.185 --> 11:42.069
We know that it's not always easy, especially when you have your responsibilities.

11:42.149 --> 11:46.212
And maybe, FUWAMOCO, we're kinda up to always something new.

11:47.893 --> 11:49.474
Something troublesome.

11:49.674 --> 11:53.797
But we want you to know that it means a lot to have you here with us.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.718
So, thank you so much!

11:55.798 --> 12:00.561
We hope that you'll continue to cheer us on lots and lots this year!

12:00.781 --> 12:04.523
As you know, we explore and experience a lot of new things to come.

12:04.703 --> 12:06.625
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:06.825 --> 12:07.585
Thank you!

12:07.805 --> 12:09.787
Thank you, always, always!

12:10.127 --> 12:12.348
BAU BAU!

12:12.849 --> 12:13.529
BAU BAU!

12:13.549 --> 12:14.890
1,000,000 and doing Twinkle Game!

12:17.849 --> 12:21.631
It doesn't seem that crazy for FUWAMOCO to actually even think about it!

12:21.651 --> 12:26.154
It's basically been a big endurance since last night, huh?

12:26.274 --> 12:26.774
Right!

12:26.814 --> 12:28.195
Basically!

12:29.116 --> 12:30.857
But isn't it really fun?

12:30.897 --> 12:31.657
Yeah!

12:31.777 --> 12:33.238
Thank you, Ruffians!

12:33.358 --> 12:35.959
Let's continue to have lots of fun in 2024 here.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.881
It's just started, too!

12:37.961 --> 12:38.981
It's just started!

12:39.001 --> 12:39.982
Oh my goodness.

12:40.642 --> 12:41.383
BAU BAU!

12:42.203 --> 12:42.483
BAU BAU!

12:43.484 --> 12:44.284
Oh, wow.

12:44.304 --> 12:45.545
You know, this weekend

12:46.869 --> 12:48.832
One of the other things that was really big.

12:48.992 --> 12:50.454
You might already know it.

12:50.474 --> 12:51.155
I don't know.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.537
Maybe they haven't, you know.

12:52.697 --> 12:54.640
Sometimes Ruffians, they don't know it's that high.

12:54.660 --> 12:55.641
Sometimes, you know.

12:55.761 --> 12:56.442
Yeah.

12:56.903 --> 12:57.524
Wow.

12:58.505 --> 12:58.865
Abyss!

12:59.522 --> 13:03.643
We had our New Year Outfit Reveal Relay!

13:03.723 --> 13:05.344
BAU BAU!

13:05.404 --> 13:08.825
Did you notice something looks a bit different right now, huh?

13:08.905 --> 13:10.365
What do you think, you know?

13:10.445 --> 13:12.066
I'm still sleepy, I didn't know anything.

13:12.106 --> 13:12.666
That's okay.

13:12.686 --> 13:13.726
You have to open those eyes.

13:13.746 --> 13:14.326
It's okay.

13:14.406 --> 13:19.808
I understand, you know, but we revealed them to you at the start of the weekend.

13:19.868 --> 13:27.510
We had like a big relay celebration together with all of Abyss, even though she's a

13:28.610 --> 13:34.232
Shiori!

13:34.652 --> 13:39.814
She has a very elegant kimono with a brush for her artisings!

13:40.535 --> 13:45.496
Noe's very stylish and well-suited for her feathers!

13:46.077 --> 13:53.479
And Biboo's super cute with her bonnet and the extra-thing pacifier.

13:55.740 --> 13:57.781
You know, I think we were all destroyed!

13:58.401 --> 14:01.942
But, how cute she looks.

14:02.262 --> 14:02.883
Right?

14:03.263 --> 14:04.663
Baby Biboo.

14:05.163 --> 14:05.524
Right?

14:06.564 --> 14:07.404
Baby Biboo.

14:08.004 --> 14:09.565
It's pretty cute.

14:09.885 --> 14:11.746
It might be too cute.

14:11.786 --> 14:13.226
Moco-chan, you feel threatened?

14:13.406 --> 14:14.027
No!

14:14.227 --> 14:14.467
No?

14:16.287 --> 14:18.128
I'm not like Biboo, okay?

14:18.148 --> 14:18.928
Yeah, you're not Biboo.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.029
I'm not shameless.

14:22.924 --> 14:25.385
That's just because you lost the Mario Kart, huh?

14:25.626 --> 14:28.067
Uh, no, it's because I want to get back at Shiori too.

14:28.687 --> 14:31.789
FUWAMOCO!

14:32.129 --> 14:34.691
We look like this!

14:34.711 --> 14:36.432
What do you think, Ruffians?

14:36.832 --> 14:37.132
Quiet.

14:37.152 --> 14:37.532
Quiet.

14:48.747 --> 14:49.287
Cute!

14:49.887 --> 14:50.768
Cute!

14:51.288 --> 14:51.708
Cute!

14:51.748 --> 14:52.828
Very pretty!

14:53.829 --> 14:55.329
Bouncy twin tails.

14:55.669 --> 14:59.730
BAU BAU!

15:00.671 --> 15:10.734
Well, you know FUWAMOCO, we not only revealed our outfits, but we also sung one song because we wanted to share our feelings with you Ruffians.

15:11.314 --> 15:15.055
And we thought it fit very well with our new outfits too, right?

15:15.835 --> 15:21.177
Yeah, but after that, we dust off because we had a big collab stream.

15:21.537 --> 15:22.577
Always busy.

15:22.857 --> 15:26.519
I know, and we talked about New Year celebrations in Japan.

15:26.619 --> 15:28.679
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

15:28.699 --> 15:30.560
Did you learn some stuff from me?

15:30.600 --> 15:33.541
We kind of became FUWAMOCO-sensei a little bit.

15:33.581 --> 15:34.862
Did you learn something?

15:35.262 --> 15:37.582
Right up by the Abyssgard Shrine.

15:37.602 --> 15:38.903
Right.

15:39.643 --> 15:42.764
If you weren't able to catch it, please check it out!

15:42.824 --> 15:44.925
You might learn maybe a new thing about

15:45.413 --> 15:54.877
New Years in Japan, but you know, we ate wasechi ryori, we talked about hatsumode, and we drew omikuji fortunes all together.

15:55.237 --> 15:55.637
Pero.

15:55.657 --> 15:59.699
It's a bit confusing, but don't think about it too hard.

15:59.759 --> 16:06.402
It wasn't just that though, because we also had a bunch of surprises too!

16:06.542 --> 16:10.964
You know, now we have a new voice-chamber out with all of our friends.

16:12.116 --> 16:15.079
Very Fugitive New Year!

16:15.520 --> 16:18.663
Such a cute illustration too!

16:18.724 --> 16:24.310
And this voice drama is different from the one that we had released near Halloween.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.512
This time, you know, we traveled to Japan.

16:26.532 --> 16:29.836
We had a bunch of fun in our brand new kimono.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.498
Different food stalls.

16:32.578 --> 16:33.279
Palmochi.

16:33.319 --> 16:34.339
Yurandera.

16:34.359 --> 16:36.320
All of those fun things.

16:36.881 --> 16:39.943
But I think this time, you know, it was just so much fun.

16:40.183 --> 16:40.583
Yeah.

16:41.383 --> 16:42.184
I think we laughed.

16:42.544 --> 16:43.585
We laughed a lot.

16:44.401 --> 16:46.622
It's probably too much.

16:46.822 --> 16:48.043
It's very Advent.

16:48.363 --> 16:49.964
It's very, very Advent.

16:49.984 --> 16:52.825
We hope that you'll check it out this time too!

16:52.845 --> 16:56.067
Ruffians, have you had a chance to listen to it yet?

16:56.107 --> 16:57.388
What did you think?

16:57.668 --> 16:58.768
It was god tier!

16:58.888 --> 16:59.929
Oh my goodness!

17:01.930 --> 17:02.390
Fun!

17:02.410 --> 17:03.951
Go go go!

17:04.031 --> 17:04.691
It was great.

17:04.851 --> 17:05.152
I'm glad!

17:05.172 --> 17:06.392
It was really fun.

17:06.432 --> 17:07.533
You have to watch!

17:14.358 --> 17:14.961
We're the same.

17:14.981 --> 17:16.145
BAU BAU Ruffian.

17:21.527 --> 17:24.488
You know, that wasn't the only surprise!

17:24.748 --> 17:32.192
Our new year outfits have also been added to the hololive Closet Acrylic Dance Collection!

17:32.472 --> 17:34.273
Ruffians!

17:34.333 --> 17:34.893
Ruffians!

17:34.933 --> 17:41.336
You can now pick us and add us to your collection with these new outfits too!

17:41.936 --> 17:45.598
And you know the acrylics dance, they look really great together!

17:46.875 --> 17:47.676
Ordered yours!

17:47.996 --> 17:48.537
Did you order?

17:48.637 --> 17:49.257
Oh you did!

17:49.537 --> 17:50.518
Oh my goodness!

17:50.618 --> 17:52.360
BAU BAU!

17:52.380 --> 17:52.800
BAU BAU!

17:52.840 --> 17:55.182
Ruffians, we have one request though.

17:55.722 --> 17:59.125
Please share your pictures of them once you receive them, okay?

17:59.385 --> 17:59.646
Yeah.

17:59.966 --> 18:00.266
Yeah.

18:00.286 --> 18:00.586
Okay.

18:01.147 --> 18:01.667
Okay.

18:01.707 --> 18:01.988
Okay.

18:02.008 --> 18:04.510
We can take them out in the snow.

18:04.730 --> 18:07.852
If there's no more snow by that time, you can make some snow.

18:08.593 --> 18:09.033
Right.

18:09.274 --> 18:10.214
Lots of stuff.

18:10.294 --> 18:11.015
Yeah.

18:12.516 --> 18:13.057
But!

18:13.877 --> 18:14.138
Well.

18:14.178 --> 18:14.818
Finally.

18:15.299 --> 18:15.619
Enough.

18:16.380 --> 18:22.943
And then, we also released a brand new song cover of BABYMETAL's Megitsune all together!

18:23.003 --> 18:25.204
BAU BAU BAU BAU!

18:25.224 --> 18:30.246
Yeah, it's on the official hololive English channel, okay?

18:30.886 --> 18:31.687
Have you listened?

18:32.947 --> 18:37.511
No, it's our first time singing a metal song, so please check it out again!

18:37.851 --> 18:38.911
It's amazing!

18:38.992 --> 18:41.773
It was really good!

18:42.194 --> 18:42.914
You heard it!

18:43.555 --> 18:46.637
BAU BAU!

18:46.657 --> 18:51.760
We were a little bit nervous, but Moco-chan, you were so cool!

18:51.880 --> 18:53.381
I did my best, yeah.

18:53.822 --> 18:56.844
And Ruffians' video is right!

18:56.864 --> 18:57.604
Something else too.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.245
Right!

18:59.710 --> 19:07.873
Definitely need to check it out, but I think with FUWAMOCO, we both are really really happy because we thought that Shiori and Biboo really shined in it.

19:08.433 --> 19:09.174
Yes!

19:09.314 --> 19:13.215
I love Biboo's solo at the Ochi-sabi.

19:13.795 --> 19:16.496
It's so good, it really ties everything together.

19:16.516 --> 19:20.318
We were so happy listening to it when we heard it the first time.

19:20.458 --> 19:23.859
And Shiori's part too, she really stands out and kind of like

19:23.999 --> 19:25.602
Do give me chocolate when you guys do 3D!

19:39.066 --> 19:47.995
We are really happy to be able to have all these special surprises for you Ruffians.

19:54.742 --> 20:02.104
That was really, really fun and, you know, we hope that you'll decide to make it a very Adventful 2024!

20:02.624 --> 20:03.784
Yes, Adventful.

20:03.804 --> 20:07.325
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

20:07.385 --> 20:11.106
Thank you for spending your holidays and your New Year time with us.

20:11.646 --> 20:14.466
Let's continue to have a really fun 2024!

20:14.526 --> 20:15.126
BAU BAU!

20:20.554 --> 20:21.154
But!

20:22.676 --> 20:26.100
This weekend, there was also something very big that happened.

20:26.120 --> 20:26.640
Something else.

20:27.201 --> 20:27.621
Yeah.

20:27.721 --> 20:30.104
And actually, it just came and went.

20:30.184 --> 20:30.765
It just ended.

20:30.805 --> 20:31.105
Yeah.

20:31.626 --> 20:40.635
It was the big whole new year cup that started yesterday and then just concluded today.

20:40.695 --> 20:41.396
The finals.

20:42.133 --> 20:53.861
Yeah, you know, over the weekend, us and Biboo and a bunch of our senpai, we all participated to see who would be crowned the best of all hololive.

20:53.901 --> 20:55.622
The best of Mario Kart.

20:55.682 --> 20:58.164
You know, it's a very serious competition.

20:58.184 --> 21:03.068
You know that a lot of our senpai spent hours and hours and hours training for it.

21:03.948 --> 21:06.050
And you know, FUWAMOCO,

21:07.495 --> 21:10.096
We intended to do a decent amount of practice today.

21:10.136 --> 21:10.556
We did!

21:10.836 --> 21:11.697
That one.

21:12.377 --> 21:17.359
But, it just happened that a lot of things kept getting in our way.

21:17.439 --> 21:17.739
Yeah.

21:17.839 --> 21:20.040
Like, you know, computer almost died.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.421 --> 21:22.261
Yeah.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.042
Wasn't stressful, no.

21:24.842 --> 21:30.344
But, you know, at least we still got to do one practice stream before the qualifiers.

21:30.484 --> 21:31.585
The first and the last.

21:31.925 --> 21:36.787
Yeah, but, you know, that's okay because I think we still excelled at

21:37.487 --> 21:40.850
Doing our best!

21:41.390 --> 21:42.331
And having fun!

21:43.272 --> 21:47.315
That's amazing!

21:48.076 --> 21:50.197
BAU BAU!

21:50.217 --> 21:53.620
I think we did pretty well.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.781
We did so well.

21:56.141 --> 22:00.103
Qualifying matches, we actually even got twin scores!

22:00.203 --> 22:00.723
Yeah!

22:00.743 --> 22:02.203
We both got 9 points!

22:02.444 --> 22:03.624
I don't know how that happened.

22:03.644 --> 22:04.765
Right!

22:05.105 --> 22:07.065
How silly is that, Ruffians?

22:07.085 --> 22:09.707
9 points?

22:09.887 --> 22:14.088
I was in Group B and Moco-chan Group A. Right.

22:15.589 --> 22:16.749
That's what a weird high.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.590
That's what a weird high.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.090
Very silly.

22:19.150 --> 22:19.931
Very silly.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.212
I know.

22:22.472 --> 22:22.832
I know.

22:23.683 --> 22:26.686
We also did our best in the semi-finals too!

22:26.806 --> 22:27.747
Hapetate.

22:27.968 --> 22:28.228
Ino.

22:28.248 --> 22:33.714
In the end, we were placed into the Zako Cup category.

22:35.276 --> 22:36.597
Are you saying they're wrong?

22:36.677 --> 22:37.798
It's not right!

22:37.818 --> 22:43.264
Ruffians, if you don't know what the Zako Cup is, it's for...

22:51.162 --> 22:52.623
The player's not to worry about.

22:52.944 --> 22:54.205
Maybe.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.349
That's the nicest way to put it, huh?

22:57.409 --> 23:00.672
You know, and in the end, we both got third to last!

23:01.153 --> 23:01.413
Why?

23:01.473 --> 23:03.035
But you know, it doesn't matter.

23:03.055 --> 23:04.997
If you put it like that, it sounds really good though.

23:05.017 --> 23:05.278
Yeah!

23:05.538 --> 23:05.958
Word!

23:06.159 --> 23:06.679
To last!

23:07.560 --> 23:09.943
But we have to say the last part, Moco-chan!

23:09.983 --> 23:10.664
We got third!

23:13.490 --> 23:16.151
But we had fun!

23:16.191 --> 23:16.932
We did!

23:17.132 --> 23:23.875
Yeah, you know, more than anything, we were just really happy to be able to participate and play with our senpai.

23:24.075 --> 23:25.636
I want to do more today!

23:25.656 --> 23:27.457
Why does it have to be over?

23:27.517 --> 23:28.117
Yeah, today.

23:28.297 --> 23:30.138
Well, you had your chances done now.

23:31.098 --> 23:35.140
I don't know, but Ruffians on top of that, Biboo!

23:35.180 --> 23:38.202
Biboo got into the Tsuyo Cup!

23:38.242 --> 23:40.963
Those are the Mario Kart plays you have to worry about.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.565
The best of the best!

23:44.225 --> 23:45.406
She did amazing!

23:45.466 --> 23:46.867
She really did amazing!

23:46.907 --> 23:48.428
We're so proud of her!

23:48.769 --> 23:49.409
I rock!

23:51.691 --> 23:54.093
Guess what, Ruffians?

23:54.373 --> 23:56.875
She even got first place in one of the rounds.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.576
That was so amazing!

23:58.716 --> 23:59.937
All our senpai!

24:01.778 --> 24:02.759
Oh my gosh.

24:03.699 --> 24:05.460
I think we almost stood up out of our chairs.

24:05.481 --> 24:25.594
BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU

24:26.601 --> 24:29.964
Kind of on that topic of Mario Kart Ruffians.

24:30.364 --> 24:31.846
It's not a misunderstanding.

24:32.046 --> 24:32.286
No.

24:32.767 --> 24:33.227
It isn't.

24:33.748 --> 24:35.910
It's not a misunderstanding that we started.

24:36.010 --> 24:36.370
No.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.112
Yeah, there was something funny that happened.

24:39.893 --> 24:40.394
Ah, well.

24:40.434 --> 24:40.714
Yeah.

24:41.915 --> 24:49.262
It seems like Hekora-senpai is trying to feel BAU BAU away from us.

24:49.302 --> 24:50.363
Look at that!

24:50.923 --> 24:51.404
Yeah.

24:52.043 --> 24:55.385
Trying to steal it.

24:55.425 --> 24:57.687
Doing the whole New Year's Cup Ruffians.

24:57.707 --> 25:03.331
You know, we all had to come up with something to say to kind of threaten our points.

25:03.751 --> 25:07.914
For some reason, Pekora-senpai decided to choose BAU BAU.

25:10.235 --> 25:12.037
What's with the HA-Ruffians?

25:13.137 --> 25:16.540
You know, Pekora-senpai has peko peko.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.021
She can say peko peko.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.322
Why is that no good anymore?

25:19.362 --> 25:19.783
Why?

25:19.943 --> 25:20.183
Huh?

25:20.644 --> 25:21.064
Huh?

25:21.544 --> 25:21.925
Yeah.

25:22.625 --> 25:27.129
You know, so... Ruffians, we thought we only have one choice, you know.

25:27.630 --> 25:31.253
We need to crush her to be able to save BAU BAU.

25:31.333 --> 25:32.134
BODY SLAM.

25:32.154 --> 25:33.535
Annihilate.

25:34.035 --> 25:38.699
Yeah, and... Ruffians, I don't... I don't think we did it.

25:39.781 --> 25:40.722
I did our best.

25:41.342 --> 25:43.524
But our best isn't gonna save BAU BAU!

25:43.544 --> 25:45.105
Yeah.

25:46.126 --> 25:50.649
Well, the only time we were able to beat Pekora-senpai was- was once.

25:51.570 --> 25:53.932
But that was when she disconnected memories.

25:54.993 --> 25:58.476
So... I don't think that counts as a win.

25:59.196 --> 25:59.697
Right?

25:59.717 --> 26:01.698
That doesn't count.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.001
We didn't beat her with our- with our strength!

26:05.021 --> 26:06.462
We didn't body slam her.

26:06.542 --> 26:06.982
Yeah.

26:07.423 --> 26:07.663
So...

26:08.567 --> 26:12.049
Ruffians, I don't really know what the future has in store.

26:12.809 --> 26:16.271
You know, we might have to stop using BAU BAU from now on.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.731
Right?

26:17.771 --> 26:19.092
You wouldn't want that, right?

26:20.233 --> 26:20.693
Yeah.

26:21.433 --> 26:21.613
Right?

26:22.073 --> 26:24.555
If Pekora-senpai says, Hey, FUWAMOCO!

26:24.995 --> 26:25.955
No BAU BAU!

26:25.975 --> 26:28.136
She's our senpai, so... Yeah.

26:32.705 --> 26:39.129
I know it's sad but our BAU BAU days might be numbered.

26:40.070 --> 26:40.530
BAU BAU

26:45.151 --> 26:46.712
Call the Oozora Police!

26:47.173 --> 26:54.118
I don't know if we need to get the Oozora Police involved in this, you know?

26:54.519 --> 26:57.121
That's kind of jumping ahead a bit.

26:57.141 --> 26:59.503
Not like, bunny hops, but...

27:12.233 --> 27:13.775
You know, leave some balance.

27:13.795 --> 27:15.036
Alright.

27:16.597 --> 27:18.399
Subaru-senpai will protect you.

27:18.439 --> 27:24.825
Well, it seems like Subaru-senpai will be interested in that sort of thing, huh?

27:25.406 --> 27:28.249
We did have a chat with her, you know.

27:29.230 --> 27:33.934
So... We'll see you Ruffians!

27:34.575 --> 27:36.397
BAU BAU!

27:37.321 --> 27:44.265
Well, you know, Ruffians, today, like every Monday, is the start to a new week.

27:44.825 --> 27:49.647
And, well, it's always good to challenge yourself to something new, right?

27:49.687 --> 27:51.048
Challenge yourself, right?

27:51.909 --> 27:58.892
And, well, Moco-chan, you usually challenge yourself to natto, right?

27:59.012 --> 28:05.956
Eating some natto, but, well, Moco-chan, you have something you wanted to say to the Ruffians, right?

28:11.757 --> 28:12.518
Ruffians!

28:15.441 --> 28:17.443
Is it okay if I ask you something?

28:19.345 --> 28:23.128
Can you listen to me for a bit?

28:23.148 --> 28:32.518
Is it okay if I don't challenge the natural today?

28:35.635 --> 28:38.756
As you know, things have been a bit rough for me recently.

28:38.837 --> 28:41.638
As you know, it's been rough.

28:42.718 --> 28:45.820
So, I just don't feel like I can challenge it today.

28:45.840 --> 28:54.984
I've been doing my best recently, but you know, it's been a bit harder than usual sometimes.

28:56.765 --> 28:58.326
Yeah, I've been doing my best.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.848
I think, you know, we all feel like this every now and then, you know?

29:04.288 --> 29:05.409
I just need to rest for today.

29:07.302 --> 29:08.546
Is that okay?

29:08.586 --> 29:09.288
No problem.

29:27.537 --> 29:28.958
That's nice, right, Moco-chan?

29:29.018 --> 29:30.119
Thank you, Ruffians.

29:30.399 --> 29:32.901
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:33.122 --> 29:33.642
Yeah!

29:34.463 --> 29:36.064
BAU BAU!

29:36.424 --> 29:37.185
BAU BAU.

29:37.245 --> 29:39.907
Yeah, we did get some new Natto, though.

29:40.087 --> 29:42.369
But, it'll be new next week, too.

29:43.290 --> 29:45.211
If we believe.

29:46.192 --> 29:47.854
BAU BAU!

29:47.874 --> 29:49.095
BAU BAU!

29:49.115 --> 29:53.278
Let's check out who's the Doggie of the Day for today!

29:53.478 --> 29:55.320
Today's Doggie of the Day is...

29:56.881 --> 29:57.061
Oh!

29:57.121 --> 29:59.283
Today's Doggie of the Day is Ralph!

29:59.724 --> 30:00.184
Ralph!

30:00.744 --> 30:01.385
Ralph.

30:01.405 --> 30:02.626
That's a good name.

30:02.786 --> 30:07.750
You know, I think it's unlike any other Doggie of the Day so far, huh?

30:07.770 --> 30:08.030
Right!

30:08.171 --> 30:08.631
Yeah!

30:09.131 --> 30:11.473
Ralph, you know, Ralph is pretty tiny too.

30:11.874 --> 30:14.576
Maybe not a chihuahua, but... A bit tiny.

30:14.696 --> 30:16.558
Don't get confused though, you know.

30:16.878 --> 30:20.461
He's actually been around for a long time, just like us!

30:20.741 --> 30:21.482
Just like us!

30:21.502 --> 30:22.783
But we're stronger than him, huh?

30:23.737 --> 30:24.698
Yeah.

30:24.738 --> 30:30.202
But I think, you know, he's been protecting this Ruffian for a long time too.

30:30.502 --> 30:32.463
But we'll protect you now.

30:32.483 --> 30:33.264
Forget it, Ralph.

30:33.844 --> 30:35.185
Forget about Ralph, hi.

30:35.205 --> 30:39.008
How does Ralph BAU BAU?

30:40.569 --> 30:41.410
Maybe kinda like...

30:56.651 --> 30:57.233
I think like that.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.117
Right?

30:58.218 --> 30:58.580
Yeah.

30:58.740 --> 30:59.102
Yeah.

30:59.263 --> 31:00.046
Sounds about right.

31:00.247 --> 31:00.468
Yeah.

31:00.999 --> 31:07.442
Wow, you know, Ralph has been doing his all to protect this mouth for many, many years.

31:07.622 --> 31:08.763
Despite the setback.

31:08.863 --> 31:10.243
It's okay, we'll take it from here.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.525
You know, his fur might be a little grey now.

31:14.585 --> 31:20.408
Maybe, you know, the luster in his eyes is not as strong as other younger puppies like Fuwamoco.

31:20.468 --> 31:21.888
But that doesn't matter!

31:21.908 --> 31:26.190
He don't feel contented to be at your side for as long as you let him be.

31:27.971 --> 31:32.514
BAU BAU!

31:35.735 --> 31:39.097
Ruffians, you've been stretching those paws, right?

31:39.597 --> 31:41.098
Let's see what you went for.

31:41.438 --> 31:43.379
Today I went on a walk.

31:43.699 --> 31:45.881
We have De-den!

31:49.142 --> 31:50.303
Did you go on a walk?

31:50.643 --> 31:53.025
A walk of a lifetime, maybe?

31:53.525 --> 31:56.007
A big series of walks around Japan.

31:56.047 --> 31:56.948
Sounds nice.

31:58.269 --> 32:10.397
It looks like you maybe went to a lot of different places, saw a lot of different scenes, and maybe picked up some treasures too at the Tokyo Cat District hololive Store!

32:10.918 --> 32:12.419
A good place.

32:13.279 --> 32:14.921
Meet Ajiomoco-chan.

32:14.941 --> 32:15.221
Right?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.723
It sounds like you had some really good luck, huh?

32:18.894 --> 32:20.995
Can't get these anymore, Ruffians!

32:21.276 --> 32:22.136
They're gone!

32:22.777 --> 32:23.457
Wow.

32:23.917 --> 32:27.120
Well, we're really glad that you have luck on your side.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.281
BAU BAU!

32:29.621 --> 32:30.502
That's a good walk.

32:30.902 --> 32:37.066
Next we have our Question of the Day!

32:37.587 --> 32:38.627
Let's see what we have.

32:38.808 --> 32:38.988
Oh!

32:39.708 --> 32:41.890
I love your Pup Talks, Mococo!

32:41.910 --> 32:46.973
I wonder, what kind of prep work do you do for your now famous BT?

32:48.895 --> 32:56.061
For instance, how do you know or plan what to say or what's your source of inspiration for your talks?

32:57.022 --> 33:01.145
Now famous, you're gonna make Moco-chan all nervous, Ruffians!

33:02.166 --> 33:02.446
Why?

33:02.466 --> 33:04.208
It's not hard, right Moco-chan?

33:06.549 --> 33:06.669
Huh?

33:06.769 --> 33:07.069
It's okay.

33:08.310 --> 33:09.270
A bit embarrassed?

33:09.850 --> 33:12.951
You know, I think Moco-chan is just right from the heart, right?

33:13.371 --> 33:15.732
No inspiration or anything needed.

33:15.752 --> 33:16.932
Yeah.

33:17.433 --> 33:22.434
She just wants to help you and, you know, we've had some hard times too.

33:23.114 --> 33:30.036
So, we try to think back to those times and maybe hope that any words we have can help you too.

33:30.757 --> 33:30.997
Right?

33:33.620 --> 33:35.181
BAU BAU!

33:35.842 --> 33:40.045
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions today!

33:40.685 --> 33:42.507
Please, please don't forget!

33:42.527 --> 33:50.052
FUWAMOCO Morning happens three times a week, so that means there's a lot of questions that could be answered.

33:50.332 --> 33:54.195
A lot of Doggy of the Days that we could crown the Doggy of the Days.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.478
You know, Pero Sightings are only if you happen to see Pero.

33:58.366 --> 33:59.667
You have to be lucky though.

34:00.007 --> 34:03.429
We also have the FUWAMOCO Scoop!

34:04.690 --> 34:05.650
There was no scoops today.

34:06.270 --> 34:09.092
Ruffians, is your journalism doing okay?

34:11.760 --> 34:14.562
Please let us know okay with the hashtag.

34:14.923 --> 34:18.165
Hashtag FUWAMOCOSCOOP FWMCSCOOP or for others, hashtag FWMCMORNING!

34:18.525 --> 34:19.145
BAU BAU!

34:19.185 --> 34:21.607
While we check out our next stream.

34:34.196 --> 34:36.417
Things kind of changed up, Ruffians!

34:36.857 --> 34:45.181
You know, well, the plan was that we'd be doing our 700k Suika Game endurance on Tuesday.

34:45.961 --> 34:50.103
But, well... Some happy things happened.

34:50.123 --> 34:54.045
And... It didn't quite work out like that.

34:54.125 --> 34:54.405
No!

34:54.445 --> 34:55.305
I'm not doing it again!

34:55.345 --> 34:55.685
I'm not!

34:55.705 --> 34:56.366
That's why, you know...

35:02.782 --> 35:04.503
Well, it already kinda happened.

35:04.643 --> 35:05.724
It happened.

35:05.744 --> 35:06.284
Sorry.

35:06.884 --> 35:08.465
FUWAMOCO is too powerful!

35:08.485 --> 35:08.525
No!

35:08.585 --> 35:10.767
Ruffians, you're too powerful!

35:11.247 --> 35:19.272
Yeah, so you know, our next team is actually gonna be Wednesday's FUWAMOCO Morning.

35:20.032 --> 35:25.575
Yeah, and after that, we're gonna be playing Sushi Soul Universe!

35:25.835 --> 35:34.940
But in between that, FUWAMOCO, we'll make sure to get some good homework done, as well as some good rest too, because we've been going right!

35:38.683 --> 35:41.767
Ruffians, make sure you take a good rest too.

35:42.188 --> 35:49.719
You rest, we'll rest, and we'll have a bunch of fun on Wednesday with FUWAMOCO Morning and Sushi Soul Universe.

35:51.410 --> 35:54.113
Rest is needed for everyone, Ruffians.

35:54.613 --> 35:57.916
But we'll see you then again!

35:58.236 --> 36:00.218
BAU BAU!

36:00.798 --> 36:05.702
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for joining us here for FUWAMOCO Morning.

36:06.023 --> 36:08.705
Maybe you stayed up all night just like us.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.366
Maybe you're just waking up.

36:11.187 --> 36:16.032
Regardless, we're happy to be able to see you bright and early today!

36:16.072 --> 36:22.758
But, before we say BAU BAU for now, we'd like to shout out to some of our Extra Special Ruffians!

36:23.359 --> 36:24.280

36:24.480 --> 36:25.961
