## Pero Sighting (6:55)

[FaithCafe](https://twitter.com/FaithCafe563/status/1715142112273158582) found Pero near their plants. Gotta need to deploy LA CHANCLA.

## Advent Halloween Party (9:26)

Reminder that you're [invited to Advent's Halloween Party](https://twitter.com/hololive_En/status/1713755393363734639)! 2023-10-31T17:00Z. Also, don't forget to share your hololive costume on Twitter with the hashtag [#AdventCostumeParty](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdventCostumeParty).

## Confession (11:48)

Mococo embarrassingly confesses that she's afraid of big dogs and asks Ruffians not to think differently of her. *...or else...*

## Happy News (15:22)

Thanks to Papapuppy, Mococo's chair has revived!

## Misunderstanding (17:16)

During their last [Holo no Suika stream](https://youtu.be/wP1T96Bwwv0), it seemed like Mococo referred to their senpai as "garbage" and "something to get rid of", but she just meant the figures on the screen with the shape of their senpai. Then Fuwawa activates some Ruffian neurons as [she refers to them as "garbage"...](https://youtu.be/WttmEXH3VWs?t=1183s) in an endearing way!

## Today I Went On A Walk (23:46)

[James Wargull](https://twitter.com/JamesWargull/status/1715083670824825053) took a photo of a very picturesque fall scenery!

## Question Of The Day (24:51)

[Zannie](https://twitter.com/FWMC_Fan/status/1705475407590674459) wonders how long it took to settle on "Ruffians" as their fan name. It seems that Mococo just came up with that one day as she woke up. Other candidates were "Kerfluffians", "Abyssians", "Doggy Pack" (used for their channel members instead) and "Hell Dog".
