00:05:17.748 --> 00:05:21.133
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:05:21.193 --> 00:05:21.654
BAU BAU!

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.692
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.333
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

00:05:29.513 --> 00:05:32.254
Together we are FUWAMOCO!

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:34.254

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:38.936

00:05:39.456 --> 00:05:43.338
Thank you, Ruffians, for joining us today for our 61st episode.

00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:43.558

00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.305
Final episode of FUWAMOCO Morning of 2023!

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:49.906
Spooky!

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:50.466
Spooky?

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:51.668
BAU BAU!

00:05:51.808 --> 00:05:52.849
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.045
For those that are just joining us for the first time ever today!

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:06.546
Amazing.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.309
Even though it's the end of the year, it can still be the first time.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.930
Always a good time for firsts.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:17.798
FUWAMOCO Morning is a short format morning show held every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday.

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:18.419
A.k.a.

FUWAMOCO!

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.222
That is hosted by us!

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:22.443

Let's all BAU BAU to a brand new FUWAMOCO Morning!

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:40.194
BAU BAU!

00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:40.454
Hai.

00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:50.541
It's the middle of the week, but it's kind of funny because it feels more like a Friday, right?

00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:53.163
Being the final FUWAMOCO Morning of the year.

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:54.905
It does feel like a Friday.

00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:56.025
But it's not!

00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:56.806
It's not!

00:06:57.346 --> 00:06:59.228
It's just been having lots of fun.

00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:02.170
Well, Ruffians!

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.993
We've had some very cool things going on recently.

00:07:06.733 --> 00:07:08.895
And well, FUWAMOCO!

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.284
I got a bit excited.

00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:17.625
Moco-chan!

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:17.685
Hi!

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:21.488
I got excited.

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:22.789
Hi!

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.834
Well, you know, usually we start with a Pero Sighting.

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:29.835
It's okay.

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:31.496
I'm too excited.

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:32.978
Can we just skip it?

00:07:33.398 --> 00:07:34.259
No Pero Sighting.

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:36.100
We'll just skip Pero.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.341
We don't need him anyways.

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:38.742
Ruffians.

00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:42.579
Pikachu forgettable, Pero.

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.700
Bye, Pero.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.780
Bye.

00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:46.341
Skip him.

00:07:50.383 --> 00:07:50.743
Skip.

00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:51.584
Skip.

00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:52.304
No Pero!

00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:54.025
No Pero!

00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:55.466
Pero-chan.

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:56.286
Pero-chan.

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:57.847
Pero-tan nashi.

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:07.052
Well, there was one Ruffian that spotted Pero.

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:09.193
Let's see where he is this time.

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:13.055
De-den!

00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:21.440
Wait, Pero's in the sky!

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:24.542
That's where Pero is.

00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:27.644
This is Pero's room!

00:08:28.544 --> 00:08:28.924
Hi.

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:31.846
Are you feeling okay?

00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:37.409
You know, I think maybe you're just blowing things out of proportion a little bit.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.890
Not like that.

00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:47.381
Pero, I think probably what happened is that he probably just happened to be flying in front of the sun when you spotted him.

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:48.521
It's just a coincidence.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.101
That's it.

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:51.682
Nothing crazy.

00:08:51.702 --> 00:08:59.745
You know, Pero, he's been around for a while, you know, even longer than I. But he's still just a demon dog, okay?

00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:03.977
You know, controlling the human world.

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:05.438
No, no, no, no, no.

00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:05.699
No.

00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:07.600
That's something else, okay?

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.425
As much as, you know, he would probably like that, that's not the case, you know?

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:14.485
No!

00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:17.186
So, feel comfort knowing that one.

00:09:17.207 --> 00:09:17.747
Okay, Ruffians?

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.148
Don't look directly at him.

00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:21.189
You still have freedom, okay?

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:24.992
You know, it's probably a good idea in every situation, okay?

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.514
Just don't look at him at all, okay?

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.556
He's not a demon god, he's a demon dog.

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.738
Spelling is wrong, okay?

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:34.379
The spelling is important.

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:35.940
It changes the meaning, okay?

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.861
Got it!

00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:40.304
BAU BAU!

00:09:40.524 --> 00:09:42.526
Okay, well, finally!

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:44.167
To what you were excited about.

00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:45.768
What I was excited about, yeah.

00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:48.110
I wanted to share with you right away, Ruffians!

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:48.971
But!

00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:52.474
Well... We just released...

00:09:53.942 --> 00:09:59.766
Brand new cover song of Speed's White Love!

00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:02.487
BAU BAU!

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:06.310
It was our Christmas present to you, Ruffians!

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.031
You've taken a look around?

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.332
Did you listen?

00:10:09.872 --> 00:10:15.876
We think that this time it's quite a different song than what we've covered before previously.

00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:18.818
So maybe you'll be able to hear a

00:10:20.928 --> 00:10:23.751
<i>FUWAMOCO Morning hajimaru yo!</i>

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.092
BAU BAU!

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:44.290
Even their new favorite too!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.351
It's just so funny because it's the oldest song we've covered so far, huh?

00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:48.791
But it's a new favorite.

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:54.673
But, you know, maybe even if you're not familiar with the song, you can still check it out.

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:57.094
We really like that song!

00:10:57.714 --> 00:11:07.737
It's sort of a cool feeling winter song, but at the same time the melody is very sort of nostalgic and sort of...

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:09.139
Hi!

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:09.519
Hi.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.120
Hi.

00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:43.695
Very famous song, so please check it out!

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:45.096
Don't pick on Moco-chan!

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:46.717
We haven't slept, okay?

00:11:46.737 --> 00:11:51.661
BAU BAU!

00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:59.568
Not just that, but there was kind of something maybe a little bit secret that happened the other day.

00:11:59.728 --> 00:12:00.409
Secret?

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:01.129
Yeah.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.171
We'll let you know.

00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:05.033
We won't keep it a secret any longer.

00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:06.334
No more secrets!

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:07.495
Ruffians.

00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:10.788
It's just about to New Year's!

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:12.050
So!

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.354
There was a new voice pack release!

00:12:16.394 --> 00:12:19.258
New Year's Holiday!

00:12:19.398 --> 00:12:21.400
Surprise!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.062
BAU BAU!

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:24.083
And this time, look!

00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:25.845
We're participating!

00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:26.686
That's us!

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:27.667
That's FUWAMOCO!

00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:28.267
We're there!

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:36.191
We've been participating, but we're in the main visual there with AZKi-senpai and Okayu-senpai!

00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.171
BAU BAU!

00:12:38.032 --> 00:12:42.833
I'm very happy to be along with AZKi-senpai and Okayu-senpai.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:48.817
You haven't been able to get it yet!

00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:56.283
This time, you know, because it's New Year's, the end of the year and the start of the year, there's two voice packs.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:13:00.706
So we hope that you'll check them out and start and end the year with us too.

00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:11.233
Ruffians, if you're really curious too, if you head to the hololive store, you can check out samples there!

00:13:12.114 --> 00:13:17.137
And you know, as usual, we recorded them in both English and Japanese.

00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:22.100
We'd love if you could compare the two.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.400
We worked really hard on them.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.242
But we also had a lot of fun!

00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:30.148
No pero.

00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:39.612
You know, we're a bit sorry that, you know, it's a total of eight voice packs at once.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:45.894
Yeah, if you buy both English and Japanese, that's a lot of voice packs, but also a lot of fun too.

00:13:46.594 --> 00:13:48.355
You want a hero voice pack?

00:13:49.035 --> 00:13:50.356
You really want ten voice packs?

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:50.496
Wow.

00:14:00.952 --> 00:14:02.653
Does Pero have his own voice pack?

00:14:02.713 --> 00:14:03.433
Not yet!

00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:04.894
Not yet!

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:08.295
I haven't seen Ruffians making a lot of buzz about these voice packs.

00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:15.942
BAU BAU!

00:14:16.343 --> 00:14:16.883
BAU BAU!

00:14:31.107 --> 00:14:31.327
BAU BAU!

00:14:31.347 --> 00:14:33.289
Don't you want to clean up a bunch of stuff with me, huh?

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:05.039
And, you know, make osechi, like Japanese New Year's food.

00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:05.340
Right?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.200
Osechi, right?

00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:07.141
Right?

00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:07.942
Yeah.

00:15:08.002 --> 00:15:11.044
Nothing about onsen trips?

00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:11.724
No.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:11.945
Right?

00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:13.066
Right!

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:14.647
BAU BAU!

00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:28.239
Well, you know, on the topic of New Year's, you know, usually around the end of the year and the beginning of the year, there's a lot of exciting things happening.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:32.642
And well, we have some more exciting news!

00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:42.629
Our senpai, the brains in charge of hololive's Koyori-senpai, is holding a 24-hour stream called KONKOYO 24!

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:53.947
That's pretty amazing, but even more amazing is that Advent has been invited!

00:15:54.227 --> 00:15:54.628
Advent!

00:15:54.668 --> 00:16:00.093
It'll be our first time collabing with Koyori-senpai, so we're really excited!

00:16:00.133 --> 00:16:02.776
Bijou and Nerissa of course will be there as well!

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:08.361
HONKOYO24 will be happening from the 2nd at 19 o'clock JST to the 3rd.

00:16:14.985 --> 00:16:20.848
We hope that you'll keep your eyes up for when we'll be on Koyori-senpai's show!

00:16:20.928 --> 00:16:25.090
It's really amazing of Koyori-senpai to do 24 hour streams.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.011
I was wondering how does it work?

00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:28.952
How does Koyori-senpai do that?

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:30.513
We really admire her strength.

00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:32.656
I like her.

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:35.019
I think... FUWAMOCO, we'd like to sleep.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.925
But we have not sleep... slept... slept yet.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.627
We do not sleep yet.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.848
We have not slept yet.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.851
All the tenses.

00:16:46.857 --> 00:16:50.100
Do you aspire to become as strong as Koyori-senpai?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.520
Yes!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.441
But no!

00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:52.842
Yes and no!

00:16:52.942 --> 00:16:55.264
Yes and no!

00:16:55.464 --> 00:16:57.686
Koyori-senpai is Koyori.

00:16:58.026 --> 00:16:59.247
We're demon dogs.

00:16:59.607 --> 00:17:01.408
Similar but different.

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:03.390
Different, okay.

00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:06.252
It feels like you two are a step away from 24 hour stream.

00:17:07.916 --> 00:17:14.204
How many streams has it been since we last slept?

00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:15.226
Four streams.

00:17:16.908 --> 00:17:17.669
Four streams.

00:17:20.253 --> 00:17:23.597
And multiple homeworks getting done in between.

00:17:28.745 --> 00:17:30.206
But it's been fun!

00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:30.847
Yeah!

00:17:31.948 --> 00:17:32.749
BAU BAU!

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:38.153
Yeah, I guess that does prove me just a step away from doing a 24-hour stream.

00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:39.734
Don't say it like that, okay?

00:17:39.774 --> 00:17:42.597
Don't say it like that, okay?

00:17:42.857 --> 00:17:45.059
BAU BAU!

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.821
BAU BAU!

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:52.145
Also at the end of the year comes a very special event.

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.962
Ruffians, do you know what it is?

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:00.945
Sleep?

00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:01.666
Sleep?

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:04.429
I guess you can sleep to the end of the year, but that's not the event.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.691
You should sleep every day, huh?

00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:11.197
Well, Comic Market is coming up very soon in Japan.

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:15.161
And you know, that means... DO-JI-SHI!

00:18:17.243 --> 00:18:20.185
Yeah, the promised land of doujinshi.

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:26.269
And Ruffians, of course you remember our goal to get our paws on FUWAMOCO doujinshi, right?

00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:26.989
Remember, right?

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:29.070
It was on our goalies that I debuted.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.471
Yeah.

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:43.579
Well, not only is Icomochi-mama selling a FUWAMOCO book this year, but we've also been seeing some other Ruffians on Twitter that'll be selling their own FUWAMOCO books and merchandise there too.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.860
How you seeing?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.921
Have you seen them?

00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:47.782
I'm so happy!

00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:49.063
I saw her eyes.

00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:49.543
Fuwamoco.

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:08.556
We took matters into our own paws.

00:19:08.636 --> 00:19:08.916
Yeah.

00:19:09.437 --> 00:19:13.059
And we started harassing Mane-chan.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:15.921
You know, to see if they can get them for us.

00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:17.682
Yeah, and Staff-san too.

00:19:17.962 --> 00:19:19.002
Not just Mane-chan.

00:19:19.503 --> 00:19:20.183
And you know what?

00:19:20.203 --> 00:19:24.306
They agreed to pick up some things for us!

00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:24.846
BAU BAU!

00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:25.346
BAU BAU!

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:26.487
BAU BAU!

00:19:26.627 --> 00:19:27.027
Yeah!

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:28.068
Yeah!

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:29.969
You know what?

00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:34.525
That's really kind of them, right?

00:19:34.805 --> 00:19:39.608
It is really kind of them, but... Now, we're making a list!

00:19:40.428 --> 00:19:44.351
So we want to make sure that we know what's going on.

00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.313
We have our paws on the pulse.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:49.854
Don't want to miss any circle.

00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:55.838
So Ruffians, please let us know if there's a circle that will be selling FUWAMOCO books, okay?

00:19:58.044 --> 00:19:59.785
Items, goods, merchandise on.

00:20:09.078 --> 00:20:09.858
How should we let you know?

00:20:09.898 --> 00:20:10.859
Tweet it out!

00:20:10.939 --> 00:20:14.361
Yeah, use the hashtag, help FUWAMOCO.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:15.482
That would be helpful.

00:20:15.542 --> 00:20:17.003
Really helpful.

00:20:17.343 --> 00:20:19.824
You know, we want to make sure that we know our list.

00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:20.445
Yeah.

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:22.786
We send it to Mane-chan.

00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:23.747
Yeah.

00:20:24.027 --> 00:20:24.628
Okay.

00:20:24.888 --> 00:20:29.751
But you know, even though we're being very

00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:31.933
Persistent.

00:20:31.953 --> 00:20:32.593
Persistent, that's a good one.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:38.416
The thin box would be best. We have to be a bit choosy as well.

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:50.879
Persistent

00:20:54.999 --> 00:21:00.964
Let us know if you see something of interest at the FUWAMOCO hashtag, okay?

00:21:01.304 --> 00:21:04.327
BAU BAU!

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:07.670
Good point, Ruffians.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.731
Comiket only comes twice a year.

00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.053
Twice a year.

00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:13.675
But every comiket's different, you know?

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.176
Ganbare, Mari-chan.

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:16.557
Ganbare, Mari-chan.

00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:22.737
But it's also very exciting with the start of the year.

00:21:22.797 --> 00:21:23.818
The start of the year!

00:21:23.838 --> 00:21:25.639
Right away at the start of the year!

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:28.421
Ruffians, don't misunderstand, okay?

00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:32.444
This is not another misunderstanding about to be born, okay?

00:21:32.464 --> 00:21:34.265
Those things are just indie books.

00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:34.525
Yes.

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:35.426
Fan books.

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:37.547
That's all fanzines.

00:21:37.747 --> 00:21:38.708
Yes, those things.

00:21:38.728 --> 00:21:39.629
We've talked about this.

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:41.230
We've talked about it every time.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.572
Many, many times, but you just don't want to listen, huh?

00:21:45.742 --> 00:21:46.342
Don't whine.

00:21:46.603 --> 00:21:47.903
I guess they're just old dogs.

00:21:47.923 --> 00:21:49.724
You can't teach old dogs new tricks.

00:21:53.407 --> 00:21:56.969
Well, we'll try to get it through your school!

00:21:57.129 --> 00:21:58.990
Don't do something cool coming up!

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:07.975
Because on the first day of the new year, we have new outfits for you!

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:08.595
New year outfits!

00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:09.476
BAU BAU!

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:13.598
So it's okay, we're just being silly.

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:15.640
Are we done?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.900
Are we done?

00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:23.304
But it's not just us, but it's all of Advent, too!

00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:27.426
Yeah, we're gonna be having an outfit review of me, like, all together.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.827
Like, all together, like, one by one by one by one.

00:22:29.887 --> 00:22:32.149
And then, Moco-chan and I together.

00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:34.610
But then, a collab, too.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.931
But we hope you'll join us for it!

00:22:37.251 --> 00:22:40.093
I know we've been saying, but I'll say it again!

00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:41.514
Okay!

00:23:04.228 --> 00:23:14.696
Ruffians, if you have any guesses on what you think the outro might look like, please send them to us and use the hashtag #FWMCNEWYEAR!

00:23:15.017 --> 00:23:17.579
I'm looking forward to the new year!

00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:21.582
No fundoshi!

00:23:22.383 --> 00:23:24.404
No fundoshi involved.

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:27.827
Ruffians, you know fundoshi.

00:23:28.088 --> 00:23:29.969
I don't explain fundoshi, right?

00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:31.351
Good.

00:23:31.551 --> 00:23:34.433
Good, good.

00:23:34.493 --> 00:23:36.255
BAU BAU!

00:23:38.857 --> 00:23:39.778
Exciting stuff.

00:23:40.078 --> 00:23:41.780
Exciting stuff!

00:23:43.281 --> 00:23:44.422
Not to explain, not to take you.

00:23:45.103 --> 00:23:45.483
BAU!

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:49.088
I sighted.

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:50.729
And then I remembered.

00:23:50.749 --> 00:24:03.218
Ruffians, you remember how just a couple days ago I said, you know, that was our last big misunderstanding of the year, right?

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:11.004
Well... That might be another big misunderstanding that happened.

00:24:12.225 --> 00:24:12.765
Yeah.

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:14.867
Yeah.

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:16.228
You know,

00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:21.432
I guess yesterday!

00:24:21.452 --> 00:24:23.054
Was it yesterday?

00:24:23.074 --> 00:24:24.935
It was just yesterday, yeah.

00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:26.136
I guess if you slept.

00:24:28.318 --> 00:24:30.339
You know, during my super chat, me!

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.781
We announced.

00:24:34.643 --> 00:24:35.063
Shocking.

00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:35.824
Get ready, okay?

00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:36.344
It's shocking.

00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:37.245
It's a bit shocking.

00:24:37.525 --> 00:24:37.886
Yeah.

00:24:37.906 --> 00:24:43.770
That... FUWAMOCO... We're now gonna be apart.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.691
We're splitting.

00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.012
Splitting up.

00:24:47.212 --> 00:24:47.512
Yeah.

00:24:47.692 --> 00:24:52.617
You know there's now a space or a slash between the Fuwa and the Moco.

00:24:53.297 --> 00:24:54.398
We've gone our separate ways.

00:24:54.418 --> 00:24:55.579
Separate ways.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:56.500
Yeah.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.143
All because I called Moco-chan a kindergartner.

00:25:01.304 --> 00:25:01.664
Yeah.

00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:03.846
Did I deserve it?

00:25:05.207 --> 00:25:06.028
Probably not.

00:25:06.068 --> 00:25:07.169
No, absolutely didn't.

00:25:07.828 --> 00:25:08.008
No.

00:25:08.508 --> 00:25:15.390
But, but now, you know, there are some new viewers coming into my streams who think that it's official!

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:15.470
Huh?

00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:17.831
Huh?

00:25:20.072 --> 00:25:22.592
What are you thinking, huh?

00:25:22.713 --> 00:25:23.253
You know.

00:25:24.953 --> 00:25:27.274
Why would you ever think that, Ruffians, okay?

00:25:27.987 --> 00:25:29.748
We were just being silly.

00:25:29.768 --> 00:25:32.950
Silly is a misunderstanding, you know?

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.892
FUWAMOCO is still FUWAMOCO, got it?

00:25:36.312 --> 00:25:38.273
We were just being silly.

00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:42.715
And you know, if we're laughing, it means that we're being silly.

00:25:42.735 --> 00:25:43.836
It's funny.

00:25:43.856 --> 00:25:48.279
We're having fun, okay?

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:50.760
That's what laughter means, okay?

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.642
It's nothing scary, nothing definite.

00:25:53.962 --> 00:25:56.723
Ruffians, go take a look at the channel name right now.

00:25:57.984 --> 00:25:59.225
Still FUWAMOCO, okay?

00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:01.046
Yeah, well, Moco-chan, you gonna double check?

00:26:01.847 --> 00:26:02.447
No, I'm good.

00:26:02.507 --> 00:26:03.228
I know what it is.

00:26:03.548 --> 00:26:03.728
Okay?

00:26:03.748 --> 00:26:04.189
Okay?

00:26:05.249 --> 00:26:05.770
Yeah.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.391
Yeah.

00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:09.292
You have to use your brain a bit, okay?

00:26:09.813 --> 00:26:11.174
We're still together.

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:12.575
It's not gonna change, okay?

00:26:12.595 --> 00:26:12.835
I know.

00:26:13.055 --> 00:26:13.916
FUWAMOCO!

00:26:14.236 --> 00:26:15.617
Still FUWAMOCO.

00:26:15.957 --> 00:26:19.260
And we'll be that way for many, many years.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:19.920
Right, Moco-chan?

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.160
Yeah.

00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:20.681
Yeah.

00:26:21.742 --> 00:26:23.463
But don't call me a kindergartner again.

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:30.458
BAU BAU!

00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:33.820
It's good to get that out of the way, Ruffians.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.840
BAU BAU!

00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:48.026
FUWAMOCO-chan, the end of the year is very, very, very, very, very fast approaching.

00:26:48.564 --> 00:26:49.364
Ruffians!

00:26:50.024 --> 00:26:51.045
Ruffians.

00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:18.873
Listen up here now, okay?

00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:23.178
Are your ears working?

00:27:24.078 --> 00:27:28.643
Listen up, because this here is a Mococo Pup Talk!

00:27:29.344 --> 00:27:32.026
And you're gonna hear it from me, Mococo!

00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:36.931
Good morning, Ruffians!

00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:38.953
Good morning!

00:27:49.407 --> 00:27:51.989
That wasn't a yawn just now, huh?

00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:57.694
No yawning, okay?

00:27:58.255 --> 00:27:59.356
No yawning, okay?

00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:05.121
Okay.

00:28:05.762 --> 00:28:06.122
Ah, well.

00:28:07.304 --> 00:28:11.908
I guess maybe one yawn is allowed, okay?

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.301
Are you still a bit sleepy?

00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:24.663
You know, from all the yummy holiday food and maybe a bit of a lack of sleep?

00:28:25.823 --> 00:28:27.603
Well, you know what?

00:28:30.004 --> 00:28:32.025
Now is the time for you to relax!

00:28:32.905 --> 00:28:34.385
You made it!

00:28:34.805 --> 00:28:36.406
We're at the end of the year!

00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:38.647
2023 is now coming to an end.

00:28:40.746 --> 00:28:44.389
And it's time to say hello to a brand new 2024!

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:47.792
Can you believe it?

00:28:47.812 --> 00:28:52.015
During 2023, all those difficult times.

00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:55.197
Those times when you truly thought you couldn't do it.

00:28:55.217 --> 00:28:57.999
When you couldn't continue on anymore.

00:28:58.019 --> 00:28:59.981
You know what?

00:29:01.722 --> 00:29:02.623
You did it!

00:29:03.323 --> 00:29:04.364
You got through them!

00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:06.166
You passed them all!

00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:08.908
You cleared every challenge thrown in your way.

00:29:09.928 --> 00:29:10.269
And now,

00:29:11.223 --> 00:29:14.145
You're all ready for whatever 2024 has.

00:29:15.206 --> 00:29:18.568
Somehow, you know, we're here at this point already.

00:29:19.688 --> 00:29:25.232
And if you feel worried about the future in 2024, I think that's natural.

00:29:26.453 --> 00:29:26.613
But...

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:35.450
I will say, there sure seems to be a lot to look forward to in 2024 as well, okay?

00:29:37.271 --> 00:29:40.293
It may seem tough sometimes, but it's there.

00:29:40.693 --> 00:29:41.133
For sure.

00:29:41.453 --> 00:29:42.334
Waiting, okay?

00:29:43.094 --> 00:29:43.234
So!

00:29:44.355 --> 00:29:53.581
Let's continue to work hard and continue to climb up the daunting wall in front of you and let's get TOTAL VICTORY over 2024!

00:29:53.762 --> 00:29:55.103
Okay, total victory.

00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:56.984
KANZEN SEIHA.

00:29:57.324 --> 00:29:57.664
Okay.

00:29:58.725 --> 00:30:02.848
You know, some years, nobody might clear the path for you.

00:30:03.648 --> 00:30:04.649
But, you know what?

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:11.114
They all grew immensely from the experience, you know, of going the way.

00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:13.699
And we had an amazing time.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.560
So, let's make that our goal for 2024 as well.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.720
Ganbatte desu!

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.161
BAU BAU!

00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:21.161
BAU BAU!

00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:26.944
Moco-chan, you made me yawn a little.

00:30:31.715 --> 00:30:33.076
Don't talk about yawning.

00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:40.199
But I feel much more pupped up for the day, pupped up for the week.

00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:40.980
You feel pup-talked?

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.100
I feel pup-talked.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.942
BAU BAU!

00:30:45.022 --> 00:30:46.723
BAU BAU!

00:30:47.163 --> 00:30:47.603
BAU!

00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:49.644
For our Doggie of the Day!

00:30:49.704 --> 00:30:52.205
This is our final Doggie of the Day for the year 2023!

00:30:52.245 --> 00:30:53.386
Final Doggie of the Day!

00:30:55.905 --> 00:30:58.287
We have... De-den!

00:30:58.447 --> 00:31:01.009
We have two doggies!

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.032
We have siblings!

00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:10.436
Today's doggies and today's are Bandersnatch and Wrangler!

00:31:11.397 --> 00:31:14.859
They're siblings that love each other lots and lots!

00:31:15.159 --> 00:31:15.339
Really?

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.000
Brothers.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.620
Really?

00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:19.642
They're the best pair ever!

00:31:20.163 --> 00:31:21.643
The best pair ever!

00:31:21.783 --> 00:31:23.284
Definitely no violence!

00:31:24.385 --> 00:31:26.626
Don't worry, it's not violence.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.747
They're just playing.

00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:29.327
Just playing.

00:31:29.728 --> 00:31:31.869
But that's Fuwawa on the right!

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:37.352
I'm not Wrangler, I'm Fuwawa!

00:31:39.613 --> 00:31:41.194
BAU BAU!

00:31:42.555 --> 00:31:43.075
I love it.

00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:44.336
I'm Bandersnatch.

00:31:44.356 --> 00:31:45.196
You're Bandersnatch, yeah.

00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:51.102
My face.

00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:54.043
Well, how do they BAU BAU, you know?

00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:55.664
Especially when they're play fighting.

00:31:56.085 --> 00:32:00.267
If I'm Bandersnatch, you're... If I'm Wrangler, you're Bandersnatch.

00:32:00.287 --> 00:32:01.588
Moco-chan Wrangler.

00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:02.489
Like that?

00:32:12.003 --> 00:32:13.804
You sound like you're kind of playing the piano.

00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:13.864
No!

00:32:14.104 --> 00:32:16.845
I'm not playing the piano!

00:32:17.365 --> 00:32:20.247
I'm Bandersnatch.

00:32:20.327 --> 00:32:23.728
Well, you know, family is very special.

00:32:23.748 --> 00:32:25.729
Especially brothers and sisters.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:32.232
You know, seeing a photo like this, it makes me feel all fluffy, you know?

00:32:32.312 --> 00:32:32.853
And fuzzy.

00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:38.115
Yeah, and I can really feel the love that they have for each other radiating out from it.

00:32:38.135 --> 00:32:38.615
Lots of love.

00:32:38.655 --> 00:32:39.916
You can see it right there.

00:32:41.403 --> 00:32:43.044
Good side-eye there, huh?

00:32:43.124 --> 00:32:44.665
Good job, Wrangler!

00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:46.927
Good job, Bandersnatch!

00:32:47.527 --> 00:32:49.649
BAU BAU!

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:51.831
So cute!

00:32:52.151 --> 00:32:55.453
Very cute.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:59.756
What was the last walk of 2023 that we went on, Ruffians?

00:32:59.876 --> 00:33:02.498
We have... De-den!

00:33:02.518 --> 00:33:06.081
Oh my gosh!

00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:06.661
Wait!

00:33:07.122 --> 00:33:07.782
A rainbow!

00:33:07.802 --> 00:33:09.583
Is it a rainbow?

00:33:09.643 --> 00:33:10.104
Yeah!

00:33:11.053 --> 00:33:14.496
Why did I think it was just a cloud?

00:33:14.836 --> 00:33:15.837
No, it's a rainbow.

00:33:15.857 --> 00:33:17.658
A rainbow that over stretches the water.

00:33:17.698 --> 00:33:20.240
I thought it was a cloud in a shape.

00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:22.141
A rainbow-shaped cloud?

00:33:22.462 --> 00:33:22.782
Yeah.

00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:25.644
No, there's clouds.

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:29.807
Maybe this is your last walk of the year.

00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:31.208
Yeah, this must be right.

00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:32.729
Or I guess you could always still take more.

00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:33.530
There's still more days.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.611
You should probably go on a walk.

00:33:35.979 --> 00:33:36.601
Yay!

00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.743
Great work!

00:33:38.164 --> 00:33:41.812
We're glad that you had such a nice surprise on your walk.

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:43.856
BAU BAU!

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.561
It's time for our Question of the Day!

00:33:48.581 --> 00:33:51.581
We have... De-den!

00:33:51.601 --> 00:33:53.062
Hello, FUWAMOCO!

00:33:53.442 --> 00:33:54.342
Hello!

00:33:54.602 --> 00:33:58.803
Since both of you have released a good amount of song covers by now... Ah, really?

00:33:58.843 --> 00:33:59.103
Thank you!

00:33:59.123 --> 00:33:59.803
A good amount?

00:34:00.003 --> 00:34:00.604
Thank you.

00:34:00.964 --> 00:34:03.164
I'm actually happy to be told a good amount.

00:34:03.204 --> 00:34:03.524
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:12.306
I was wondering if you both record while in each other's presence in the same room, and maybe give each other advice, or is it maybe too embarrassing?

00:34:12.686 --> 00:34:13.707
Much love, BAU BAU!

00:34:13.787 --> 00:34:14.887
BAU BAU!

00:34:15.828 --> 00:34:18.071
This is a good question too.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:21.635
I think though that being embarrassed in front of each other while singing...

00:34:23.377 --> 00:34:24.678
No, that's something, no.

00:34:24.838 --> 00:34:25.699
It doesn't happen.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:34.685
Yeah, if anything, you know, I feel like it's very comfy and helpful because, you know, we can give each other honest feedback and advice.

00:34:34.745 --> 00:34:38.047
But sometimes I feel like we're a little hard on each other, too, in a good way!

00:34:38.087 --> 00:34:39.108
In a good way, too!

00:34:39.468 --> 00:34:40.849
Moco-chan, you can do better than that.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:47.314
You know, you can listen to yourself with your ears, but it's different from somebody else listening to you with their ears, right?

00:34:47.354 --> 00:34:47.834
Yeah, so...

00:34:49.515 --> 00:34:53.776
And also, you know, we kind of help each other as recording engineers, too.

00:34:54.176 --> 00:35:02.118
And that makes the process go so much faster than it would otherwise, so... Moco-chan, please always help me, okay?

00:35:02.158 --> 00:35:02.338
Yeah.

00:35:02.598 --> 00:35:11.400
I feel like the only frustrating part is because, you know, we know each other, so then, we'll be like, ah, you can do better, right?

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.601
So then, it can be frustrating because you're like, no, I'm doing my best!

00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:16.302
And I'm like, no, you can do better!

00:35:16.622 --> 00:35:17.482
I know you can!

00:35:17.862 --> 00:35:18.202
Yeah.

00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:20.967
Not just me, Moco-chan feels the same way, you know?

00:35:20.987 --> 00:35:21.727
Yeah, it's the same.

00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:24.688
And then when Moco-chan gets it on me, I'm so proud.

00:35:24.728 --> 00:35:26.389
Yeah, you did it exactly how I said.

00:35:26.409 --> 00:35:27.649
That was perfect!

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:28.169
Right?

00:35:28.449 --> 00:35:29.029
Are you sure?

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.830
I'm not sure if... No, that was perfect.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.650
You're done.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:32.451
You're done.

00:35:32.651 --> 00:35:32.971
Yeah.

00:35:33.371 --> 00:35:37.012
You know, we're just... We're glad that we have each other to help us, right?

00:35:37.072 --> 00:35:37.912
A team.

00:35:37.972 --> 00:35:38.733
A team.

00:35:39.233 --> 00:35:41.094
BAU BAU!

00:35:41.634 --> 00:35:44.855
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for all your submissions!

00:35:45.135 --> 00:35:48.376
All your submissions during the past five months and...

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.655
Thank you, Ruffians!

00:35:53.675 --> 00:36:00.303
I hope that you'll continue to want to be an important part of FUWAMOCO Morning together with us in the new year too!

00:36:00.664 --> 00:36:02.546
Your feelings won't change, right?

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:04.809
I sure hope they won't.

00:36:05.896 --> 00:36:09.979
Because you know, FUWAMOCO Morning is a show that we make all together.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:12.000
And we'll be here waiting for you, okay?

00:36:12.681 --> 00:36:14.102
Thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:16.123
Please join us when you can, okay?

00:36:16.243 --> 00:36:21.267
We look forward to more FUWAMOCO Mornings together with you in 2024!

00:36:21.327 --> 00:36:22.548
BAU BAU!

00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:30.474
While we'll take a look at our upcoming series here, next we have... De-den!

00:36:30.714 --> 00:36:31.814
White Album!

00:36:32.555 --> 00:36:33.696
It's been a while.

00:36:34.116 --> 00:36:35.337
You've been waiting, huh?

00:36:35.377 --> 00:36:40.439
Unfortunately, we had to kind of postpone things last week because Moco-chan, you had a bit of a migraine.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.481
A bit of a migraine?

00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:43.761
Not a bit of a migraine.

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:45.002
Yes.

00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:56.948
It's okay because Moco-chan's feeling all better now and we can go back to White Album as a visual novel that's very very special to me.

00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:00.671
It's pretty interesting.

00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:03.153
To summarize it very quickly, our girlfriend is

00:37:06.716 --> 00:37:07.897
Yuki Morikawa.

00:37:07.937 --> 00:37:10.138
She's now a very famous idol.

00:37:10.758 --> 00:37:13.319
And, well, things are kind of a bit rough.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:17.041
And our senpai in the back there, Nina, she's kind of interested in us all of a sudden.

00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:18.661
And then she invites us on a date.

00:37:18.722 --> 00:37:20.502
And Ruffians wanted to go on that date.

00:37:20.602 --> 00:37:21.043
I did not.

00:37:21.543 --> 00:37:23.103
And now things are bad.

00:37:23.504 --> 00:37:25.865
So we're gonna see if we can fix things.

00:37:26.885 --> 00:37:28.166
Or we'll see how things turn out.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:30.047
Fix the mess that the Ruffians got us into.

00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:34.686
So we hope that you'll join us for White Advent tonight!

00:37:34.706 --> 00:37:35.766
Yes!

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:40.609
And then we take a peek at our very, very, very busy schedule.

00:37:40.649 --> 00:37:41.809
Get off the binoculars.

00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:43.350
Yeah, get off the binoculars.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.951
Ruffians, look!

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:48.533
Wow, there's something for every Ruffian here.

00:37:48.573 --> 00:37:49.413
There truly is.

00:37:49.553 --> 00:37:50.394
Yeah, but...

00:37:50.774 --> 00:37:54.496
You know, we keep on saying this is the last FUWAMOCO Morning of the year.

00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:55.817
It's true, it is.

00:37:56.217 --> 00:38:00.300
But, on Friday we kinda have something a little bit different there.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.661
It says live.

00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:02.941
What could that be?

00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:05.123
Maybe it's a different kind of morning show?

00:38:06.796 --> 00:38:09.097
We hope you'll still wake up for it, okay?

00:38:10.058 --> 00:38:13.699
BAU BAU!

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:21.083
Here we are at the end of the final FUWAMOCO Morning of 2023.

00:38:21.723 --> 00:38:26.365
Thank you so much, Ruffians, for being here with us every morning.

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:28.126
Maybe some mornings you overslept.

00:38:28.566 --> 00:38:29.447
That's okay.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.128
I'll forgive you, I guess.

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.708
Just this once, maybe.

00:38:32.968 --> 00:38:34.089
Maybe again, I don't know.

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:40.959
It means a lot for us to be able to protect your morning and the... Morning protects your smile and your morning, maybe.

00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:42.682
In the morning.

00:38:42.782 --> 00:38:45.245
Protect your morning, that's not what we're here to do.

00:38:45.265 --> 00:38:46.668
We're here to protect your smile.

00:38:46.688 --> 00:38:49.011
If that's a happy side effect, then that's good too.

00:38:50.513 --> 00:38:52.895
But thank you so much, Ruffians!

00:38:53.395 --> 00:39:00.301
